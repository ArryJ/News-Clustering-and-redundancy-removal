0,['13/03/2020'],Bengaluru in shutdown mode amid COVID-19 scare,"Over the last few days in Bengaluru, the city’s dreaded traffic congestion has eased out, given that more employees are working from home, and schools have suspended classes for children up to standard 5. The government has issued guidelines to district authorities to handle a worst-case scenario, with all public gatherings being cancelled. But with confirmed cases of COVID-19 being reported in Bengaluru, there is no denying that a large chunk of the city’s populace is in panic mode. Tech park employees are being checked for temperature spikes; sanitisers and masks are in short-supply and those who are still selling these items are making a killing on them and the University of WhatsApp is not helping matters.Shopping establishments are, no doubt, affected by people shunning public places were large numbers usually gather. “Online shopping is still operational and thriving, as are home deliveries,” says Aijaz Ahmed*, a supermarket owner. But the same cannot be said for cinema halls, both at malls and stand alone. In fact, while a few new films have hit theatres today, the next few weeks seem bleak, with makers pushing their release date. Filmmaker Vikyaath, who was all set to release his Prajwal Devaraj-starrer Inspector Vikram by the month-end, is now looking at a date sometime in May. “I am an exhibitor as well and have been seeing the steady decline in the footfalls in theatres. People are scared and right now, it really does not make sense for films to be released, when collections do not even cover basic electricity costs,” he says.The team of Thurthu Nirgamana was looking at a window just after the release of Duniya Vijay’s Salaga and targetting early April. But the present scenario has thrown their plans haywire. “A final call on our release plans will be firmed up only by the end of the week. We are still analysing the situation,” says Sharath BS, from the film’s team. Ramesh Aravind is also in a dilemma about when to set a date for the release of his next directorial, 100. “The film has been censored, but we are monitoring the situation to determine a release. We were targetting April 10, because it coincides with the 50th day of my film Shivaji Surathkal, but that looks unlikely,” says Ramesh.A distributor, on condition of anonymity, adds, “There has, no doubt, been a drop in the footfalls in theatres.” A decision on closing movie halls, though, is pending and will be taken only if there is a government directive to this effect. A few single-screen halls have, however, already downed shutters as a precautionary measure.Following the government directive, schools across the state have suspended classes for kids up to class five, while the rest either have exams or have begun summer school for the next academic year. This, of course, has driven parents into a tizzy, worried about the safety of older children. “Incubation period ranges from five days to two weeks, and a child can be asymptomatic yet, be a carrier and pose risk to other children. Also, unlike offices and tech parks, where employees are being scanned for temperature variations and other symptoms, children remain in a closed environment for hours without such monitoring. It would be ideal not to expose children to such uncertain conditions for a few days until the situation improves,” says Denet Pradeep, whose daughter is currently attending summer school for Class 10.Another parent and medical professional, though, says that stopping children from attending school does not entirely solve the problem. “You can stop them from going to school, tuition and other extra-curricular activities, but as long as the parents and other caretakers continue to be out and about, the risk of bringing an infection home is still there. Instead of sequestering the kids, the focus should be on inculcating preventive measures, like increased hygiene and best practices to be followed when sneezing and coughing,” she says.Several music events and performances, including college fests have been cancelled or postponed indefinitely. Artistes from the city have taken to social media in the past few days to announce the cancellation of events. Bengaluru-based band Best Kept Secret had to cancel several gigs in the country, says frontman Behram Siganporia. “Around 7-8 shows that were scheduled to be held in different parts of the country have been postponed and in Bengaluru all our future shows have been put on hold as of now,” says Behram.Similarly, convocations and fests at several colleges across the city have been cancelled or pushed until further notice. A statement put up by students, on their website, reads, “In view of the COVID-19 Corona Virus outbreak and the advisories by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and the World Health Organisation to avoid large gatherings, IIM Bangalore has decided to postpone the Convocation 2020 scheduled for Friday, March 20.” Students of Dayanand Sagar University, too, postponed their cultural fest until further notice. “We have been asked to postpone the fest until further notice,” says Aldrich Shawn Lewis, a student and a member of the Centre for Performing Arts, which was handling the fest.Bangalore Open Air, a rock and heavy metal festival that features local and international bands, scheduled for March 19 and 20 has been pushed, with fresh dates to be announced later. Several international artistes, who were to perform in the city, have postponed their performances. Aman Chainani, owner of a restaurant that was hosting international artiste Jody Wisternoff, said that the performance was pushed due to the COVID-19 scare. “Since Jody had a history of traveling to South Korea, the event scheduled in our restaurant was pushed,” says Aman. Singer Khalid’s Free Spirit tour to India has also been pushed until further notice.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74593713,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-235978/74593713.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/bengaluru-in-shutdown-mode-amid-covid-19-scare/articleshow/74593713.cms
1,['13/03/2020'],Will movie buffs be deprived of new films from this month end?,"On Tuesday, film distributors belonging to various associations in Tamil Nadu came together for a press meet to announce their decision of refraining from distributing new films from March 27 as a mark of protest against the TDS levied on them and the Local Body Entertainment Tax (LBET) on movie tickets.T Rajhendherr, president of the Chennai Kanchipuram Tiruvallur District Film Distributors Association , says, “We have decided not to release new films from March 27 as it has become difficult to afford the TDS. Our Prime Minister had informed us that there will be a uniform tax across the country. But there is 8% LBET levied in addition to the 12% GST here, and hence, it should be revised by the government. This decision has been taken after discussions with all the distributors’ associations in the state.”Meanwhile, the exhibitors are on a wait- and-watch mode. They want to look at the developments before making their move. CT Valliappan, owner of a movie theatre in Vadapalani, says that he’s yet to receive any intimation regarding the protest. “I can’t talk much about this now as I haven’t received any information pertaining to it. Let them sort it out first,” he says.Rakesh, who owns a theatre complex in Chromepet, informs that a decision on this issue will be known only after a meeting of exhibitors, which they are planning to conduct soon. T Mannan, secretary of the Chennai Kanchipuram Tiruvallur District Film Distributors Association , says he is waiting for the exhibitors to take a decision on this. “We have expressed our concern — the difficulty of coping with additional taxes. There may be a chance that theatres, too, will be willing to shut down in order to get this issue resolved.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74594622,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1430732/74594622.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/will-movie-buffs-be-deprived-of-new-films-from-this-month-end/articleshow/74594622.cms
2,['13/03/2020'],Radhika and I love following traditions and this was one of them: Yash,"On Wednesday morning, the crowd outside the Nanjundeshwara temple in Najangud, Karnataka, swelled more than the usual. Besides the presiding deity, they were also waiting to get a glimpse of their favourite stars, Yash and Radhika , who were on a private visit to the temple along with their family. The actors were at the historic temple for the traditional head tonsuring ceremony of their daughter, Ayra . The couple, dressed in a traditional silk panche and shirt and a green Kanjeevaram sari respectively, performed an abhisheka, followed by another set of pujas. They also sponsored the anna dasoha (the day’s meals) for the devotees. Ayra, we hear, quite enjoyed her brief tonsuring ceremony, while her parents kept her entertained throughout with rhymes. Yash, say sources close to the actor, had been working non-stop for the past two months and had taken time off to be with his family.Speaking about the experience, Yash says, “Nanjundeshwara is our family deity and I remember my parents taking me there when I was a child, for my first tonsuring ritual. So, it was a sentimental moment when I sat there with my wife and kids for the same ceremony. Radhika and I love following traditions and it was very special moment for all of us.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74594446,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-208107/74594446.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/radhika-and-i-love-following-traditions-and-this-was-one-of-them-yash/articleshow/74594389.cms

Called Bengaluru Boys, the film directed by Raj Surya is an exploration of the life of modern-day youngsters, and will have Vainidhi in a role that is in stark contrast to that in her debut movie.Speaking to us, Vainidhi says, “This is my first movie outside my home banner, so, in a sense, it feels like a debut,as I get to work with completely different actors. Bengaluru Boys has actors Sri Mahadev , Chandan Achar and Sachin on board. The real test begins for me now, as people from the industry will get to see how I am as an artiste on the set itself and it won't be like the protected environment that I had on Yaana. I have to prove myself from the word go. After Yaana, I was looking for an out-of-the-box character, which I got with Bengaluru Boys. I play an introverted middle-class traditional girl, who is kindhearted. Although she speaks very little, what she does has gravitas.

So, I was looking at someone who could fit the age group perfectly. Also, Anandhi has the potential to carry a film on her shoulders. I’m sure this will be her career best film,” says the debutant filmmaker.So, what’s the film about? “The story revolves around Kamali, a girl from a small town, and follows her journey from a Class 12 student to when she completes her college education. We trace her life, her love, what drives her and how she faces the challenges life throws at her,” says Rajasekar, “We always say — don’t shy away from setting your bar high. Think big so you’ll achieve big. There are people who have low self-esteem and that stops them from achieving what they want in life. Life-la jeyikkaradha vida nammala naame jeyikkaradhu mukkiyam.

Jazla Madasseri has been a vibrant presence on social media for years, raising her voice for social issues. From the time Bigg Boss season 2 roped her in as a wildcard entry participant, to when she exited the house after five weeks, the 24-year-old firebrand was much discussed by the show's fans. Whether it was how she stood up to fellow contestant Rajith Kumar ’s conservative views or befriended Daya who was considered her nemesis, her fans have many reasons to laud the Malappuram girl. In conversation with Jazla:

How ready were you to be part of the Bigg Boss house?

I had never watched the show and when I first got the call for it, I didn’t say yes. But, when my friends and boss asked to give it a try, I decided to take it as an experiment. How did I prepared for it? The day before entering the show, in my hotel room, I saw a few one-minute videos.

And once you were in?

I entered the house on day 21. I had no strategy and was my natural self. Outside, I had seen support pouring in for certain participants but once in, I could see they aren’t the people they were made out to be. When I completed 20 days, locked in, seeing the same faces and only faraway views of high-rises or trees, I also understood the pressure of those within. Many were on complete game mode in the house. Our only outside connection was Lalettan. For a travel and freedom lover, it was tough.

Your verbal fights with certain contestants like Rajith Kumar won tremendous air time.

I got into arguments only when lines were crossed. As everyone knows, there are those who propagate baseless ideas in the house. Whenever possible, I have tried to get into healthy discussions with them. But they don’t listen to other’s views and just walks away while we speak! They also often spoke encroaching into my comfort zone, close to my face, which but wasn’t clear on TV. Arguments like autistic children are born to obstinate women were too much for to take for me. My own sister, married off at 15, has an autistic daughter. What kind of obstinate woman would she have been at 15?

However, when the proceedings of 24 hours get edited to just one, only my arguments were included. We are helpless, as the show agreement allows it. After all, that’s apparently what the audience want – a girl fighting, using harsh language, giving sharp expressions – which are easy to criticise. My own friends said I didn’t present many ideas well and restricted myself to pseudo science arguments, which isn’t the reality. As per rules, we aren’t even allowed to discuss religion or politics there. Social issues are my sphere of work and so, these topics would naturally come under its purview. And yet, I tried not to break show rules.

There was an instance in which my body was grabbed inappropriately from behind, during a task. I reacted strongly and even said I’m leaving. But it was projected as a planned move by Fukru and me, and it disappointed me. I couldn’t even sleep well from then and wanted to leave.

Daya, who was considered your nemesis, recently said she wants you back in the show. What changed between you two?

I knew her only as someone who posted numerous videos attacking my views, and as I used to feel she has a hidden agenda, I never took her name or reacted to her in my videos. After two days in the house, I could see she was a lonely, innocent soul who acts out of misunderstanding. I could even communicate certain views to her better.

Did you feel you were weak in tasks?

I couldn’t even pee for two days after getting kicked during a task and my legs still have scars. There are even those who were bleeding after tasks. Many from season one told me their tasks were simpler. But this time, Bigg Boss gives instructions on the lines of ‘regardless of whether you get hurt, do the tasks’. Hurting others in ‘game spirit’ and later applying medicine on their wounds didn’t excite me.

Were you expecting eviction after five weeks?

In fact, from my third week in the house, I was all packed and ready every weekend, to leave. After RJ Sooraj’s eviction was announced, I was praying they called my name too and I was glad Lalettan did. If I would have continued, I might have punched some people’s faces as I couldn’t take it anymore (laughs).

Do you miss anyone from the house?

I was attached to Fukru and Sandra. Fukru is a real entertainer and thanks to his lovely stories about his family, I am in touch with them a lot too.

How’s the response after you came out of the show?

I have gone for many programmes since then. Except for certain ‘armies’ who attack me and Manju online by morphing our photos and creating memes, others have been very good to me.

There’s something about Sivakarthikeyan (SK) —it could be his crazy bone, a sense of familiarity that engulfs you the minute you strike up a conversation with him, or that typical Tamizh paiyyan look which draws you instantly to him. And probably much more, which explains why he has been voted the Chennai Times Most Desirable Man of 2019 from a bunch of achievers, all under the age of 40. When we tell him this, he’s unsure if he’s heard us right. We reiterate, and he breaks into his trademark smile and goes, ‘Aiyyo, nambave mudiyala’. In a no-holds-barred conversation, SK talks to us about his concept of love, desirability and more…I didn’t quite believe my manager when he told me this. I even asked my friend Darshan (of Kanaa fame) to check again if it was true. I was very happy when Anirudh won this title last year. I had even texted him. I think I was at No 2 slot two or three years ago. Indha varusham naan dhan Most Desirable-nu sonnappa ennaku purilla (smiles). I don’t really know on what basis people have chosen me. I am sure ‘desirable’ has a lot to do with personality and looks. When it comes to looks, I am not someone who really dresses up well or carries off any style. Maybe people like the way I am. This is new for me, but I am very excited.I didn’t tell my wife at all! I want to surprise her when it comes out in print. I think she will be very excited when she sees the newspaper today. She saw me as a ‘hero’ before anyone else did. She’s always excited when it comes to anything that relates to me – she buys branded stuff for me, she chooses my clothes. She doesn’t spend on herself, but will not think twice if she has to buy anything costly for me. Ellarukkum naan comedian-a therinjappa, avangalukku naan hero-va therinjen. I am sure she will be thrilled to bits.I think you need to be yourself. For instance, if you get into a relationship, you will notice how the person looks only the first few days. Over time, you will only care about what kind of person they are. More than appearance, how beautiful you internally are matters the most. Also, desirability can be subjective. I might like a certain way of dressing, but it might be different for you. To each his own.Not really. Azhaga rasikkarathu thappu illa. But you should know where to draw the line. Men or women, avanga azhaga irundha, azhaga irrukaanga-nu mattum dhan paakkanum. Next ennanu yosikardu dhan thevailladha vela. But being married isn’t a deterrent. When we started Seemaraja, we knew that Samantha was going to get married. That didn’t even come as a point of discussion when we got her on board. I am married and I am working in this field. She was also going to get married (at that time). So what? Actors, actresses or models would like to be appreciated for the way they look/ carry themselves. It should be in the right meter.Actually, I have a Bollywood crush… Alia Bhatt. I find her very cute. She is cheerful and is always smiling. Maybe I get to see only those pictures in which she’s smiling (laughs). I like women who are very cute. I have seen her films, too. I loved 2 States… she played a south Indian in the film. I think I like her because of that, too, as that was the first film of hers I saw.(Checks the road through the window to see if women are queuing up to see him) See, I don’t have that kind of fans. Everyone is sweet to me. I get messages from female fans and I feel shy when I read them. People have made videos using scenes from my films, and I find these things amazing. But I’ve never had female fans landing up at my doorstep.I love that tag. That won’t change even when I get older (laughs). It is always good to have people call you ‘anna’. They will always be there with you. I never look at myself as a lover boy or a chocolate boy. I know my reality. If people like me, it is mostly for my sense of humour. I think that is my asset.It was a one-sided love. I was in college then and she didn’t know about how I felt. Today, I would call it more of an infatuation. But at that time, I felt very deeply about it. Appo adhu bayangaramana love. I studied in an all-boys school. So, I didn’t know how to speak to a girl. When I got into college, I was smitten by her. But I didn’t know how to express my feelings. Eventually, it fizzled out. She’s married today.It’s accepting someone in totality. Everyone has their own flaws, there are issues with everyone. But if you love them truly, you accept them for what they are. We all have minuses – ellathayum serthu accept pannradhudhan love.Comparisons — with others, as well as your past and present. I’ve seen this happen with my friends who’ve married the person they fell in love with. You were not like this when we were in a relationship – that’s a statement they often make. I think when you are in love, andha ponnu kedaikkamattalangra mentality-la you’ll do everything. But after marriage, andha ponnu kedachuttale-nu you change. That simply won’t do.Initially, I used to retort out of ego. Now, I’ve learnt that the trick is to stay quiet; we both do that, and use that silence to figure out whose mistake it is. I usually don’t say much that day, but the next day, I take her out. But you shouldn’t take them out because you have fought with them! That becomes their trump card (laughs).For her 30th birthday — it was in last November – I organised a treasure hunt that started at 8pm and ended at 12 midnight. I’d hidden 30 gifts at various places in our house, office and even at our friends’ places. She opened the last gift closer to midnight and then, I got her inside the house blindfolded. Her parents had also come home. Kanna thorandhu, kadhari kadhari azhudhuttanga. This surprise took a lot of planning, and there was a goof-up in the last gift’s location — instead of the guava tree, my friend placed it on the lemon tree! That’s the only surprise I have given her, though she surprises me often.It was in 2013 I think, and there were these reports that I was going to divorce Aarthi! She was seven months pregnant then and it had affected me deeply. More than the rumour, I think it was the timing that affected me. She was the one who brought me the clipping. Even if she was upset, she didn’t express it because she didn’t want me to get upset.Neengale nalladha ezhudunga!I only attend my friends’ birthday parties and success meets.No, not really.Yes, I would think so. See, there’s no use of inviting me to parties — koopta edhavadhu prayojanam irukkanum. Onnu correct-a company kudukkanum, illa at least neraya neramavadhu irukkunam. I don’t do both. I have played cricket with Suriya and Dhanush. That’s about it.No one has seen the real Sivakarthikeyan – neither on TV nor in cinema. I tease and pull people’s legs, but I realised that ellathulayum kalaicha kashtam dhan. It took a while for my wife to understand that I am like that! But friends kitta unleashed version dhan.I don’t think so. I work out like crazy for only three months, and do nothing for the next six-seven months. I put on weight and then, it’s back to work out. I eat a lot of sweets. I was shooting with Sunil (Vaibhav’s brother) recently and he got scared seeing me eat — Mysore pak and chocolates in the evening and brownie with ice-cream after dinner. Brownie with ice cream is my stress buster. So, six-pack na psych aayiduven.If a role demands, then I will avoid… that story and do another one (laughs). But on a serious note, if a story really needs me to look like that, then I’ll do it because it’s work for me. I’ll stop ice cream and brownie, reduce carbs and go on a fruits-vegetables-lean meat diet, work out and go on a proper routine. But maybe just for three months!",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74594687,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-947698/74594687.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/chennai-times-most-desirable-man-2019-sivakarthikeyan/articleshow/74594687.cms

Actors Vijay Sethupathi, Jagapathi Babu and I are the three villains. All three of us share major screen space. This is a pucca commercial mass entertainer that will go on floors in a month's time.” The actor, who is will also be seen in Narappa, the Telugu remake of Tamil film Asuran, adds, “My character, Dorai Swamy, has been rewritten for the Telugu version and gets a lot more relevance in the narrative. The shoot is currently underway in Madurai .”Considering that he is just picking up the nuances of Telugu, Raj has been particular about learning his lines much in advance before shoots. “When I began my career in Telugu cinema , I didn't have a lot of lines. But once I proved my acting prowess, makers began giving me lengthier lines, which, honestly, I am not comfortable with. Having said that, I am a quick learner, so, hopefully I will soon speak Telugu without getting any prompts on the set.”Meanwhile, Raj is also Kollywood bound with Battery , in which he is playing a cop. “It is a medical thriller that revolves around the drug mafia. I play an honest and diligent cop; it is character that has different shades and will give me a new image,” sums up the actor, whose next Kannada cinema outing is Kotigobba",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74592519,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-953527/74592519.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/raj-deepak-shetty-to-play-antagonist-in-allu-arjuns-next/articleshow/74592519.cms

Thanks to that association, I got a chance to debut with a Kamal sir film, and that too, in Bollywood. I’d worked on the Hindi remake of Magalir Mattum — Ladies Only.PC sir solli Kamal kudutha vaaippu adhu. Usually, for a cameraman, shooting a movement is challenging. As luck would have it, my first shot in my first film was a movement scene that lasted for almost three minutes. The character that Nasser played (Randhir Kapoor played the role in the Hindi version) had to reach the office building, take the lift, enter the office, walk through its length and breadth, greet the staff and then finally sit on his chair in his room. I was a little scared because it’s the first time I was sitting in front of a camera on my own. Kamal sir asked me, ‘Mudiyuma?’, and I confidently told him I could.So, I followed the character continuously with my camera and finally switched off when he reached his room. The minute the shot was over, everyone on the set clapped for me. That was a difficult shot and I’ll never forget how excited I was when I pulled it off.

14,['13/03/2020'],"Won’t sell BSNL &amp; MTNL, plan to revive them: Govt","NEW DELHI: At a time when the Narendra Modi government has announced a spree of disinvestment in major public sector companies including industry giants like BPCL, LIC, Air India and more, it has told Parliament on Thursday that it will not go in for selling out or disinvesting state-owned telephone companies BSNL (Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited) and MTNL Mahanagar Sanchar Nigam Limited) and instead has planned for a “revival” of both companies.

The government’s “plan to revive” the two major telecommunication companies will generate some hope in the minds of huge number of BSNL and MTNL employees who have been suffering for more than a year now, with many going without salaries for months.

With both companies reeling under financial crisis, salaries of employees have been delayed for months, leading to strikes by protesting workers. ""The government has approved the revival plan for BSNL and MTNL in October 2019,” minister of state for communications Sanjay Dhotre said on Thursday in a written reply to a Rajya Sabha question raised by Trinamool Congress MP Manas Ranjan Bhunia.

The minister, in his reply to a question on “whether government has any plan to sell out or disinvest the BSNL and MTNL” said, “No Sir. Government has no plan to sell or disinvest BSNL and MTNL. The government has approved the revival plan for BSNL and MTNL on 23.10.2019.”

The minister also informed Rajya Sabha that, “78,569 employees of BSNL and 14,387 employees of MTNL have taken VRS (voluntary retirement),” replying to a related question specifically on the VRS scheme in the two companies.

Asked about “the reasons why the rest of the employees are not getting regular salary,” the minister admitted, “Salary of employees of BSNL/MTNL is delayed due to their poor financial condition resulting from revenue and liability mismatch.” He told the House that “BSNL and MTNL have informed that salary up to the month of December, 2019 has been paid.”

The suffering employees of both BSNL and MTNL have gone on strike to protest against the salaries being withheld and other issues in the companies, several times last year and BSNL employees were on a country-wide hunger strike on February 24.

Leading lady Disha Patani looked ravishing in a maroon bodycon dress and dramatic eye make-up. Aditya Roy Kapur seemed to be twinning with his leading lady as he was snapped in a maroon casual t-shirt. Anil Kapoor seemed to be taking all the necessary precaution against the Coronavirus outbreak and arrived wearing a mask for safety. Director Mohit Suri ’s wife Udita Goswami and Kunal Kemmu were also snapped at the success party hosted in at a suburban hotel in Mumbai.‘Malang’ opened to a positive response at the box office and earned Rs 6 crore on its first day. In its second week the film managed to cross Rs 50 crore.In an exclusive chat with ETimes, Mohit Suri had revealed that a sequel to the thriller is in the pipeline. “Sequel to ‘Malang’ is definitely on the cards but I cannot confirm at the moment,"" he had said. Talking about the film's success, Mohit had added, “‘Malang’ is an off-beat film with an ensemble star cast. Despite many big films releasing around it, it is sustaining the weekend after the weekend. Most people had given up on it even before releasing it. So this film collecting Rs 50 crore is more in valuation than the film which does Rs 450+ business at the box-office. The film today has spoken for itself.

20,['13/03/2020'],Restaurant Review: La Veggie,"It’s the acid test. Does the vegetarian, Jain diner approve of La Veggie’s Jain food? After all, the restaurant’s name itself is tightly focusses and targeted. And when my Jain-diner guest Arun Kumar Vyas is also a famous astrologer, face reader and a phenomenon emerging as one of India’s most followed astrologers on Instagram, our restaurant review becomes even more interesting. We eat our way through the menu. Over lunch with him and his family, we discuss his weekly zodiac sign ‘Vyas Card’ predictions on Instagram, which are popular worldwide. His wife Veena and children Rajvardhan and Parth have been vegetarian Jain diners since birth. Based in Malad, the family is very particular about the restaurants they dine in. And, La Veggie is just the perfect restaurant to get their views over an exciting lunch, peppered with fun facts about face reading and astrological predictions.Located in bustling Girgaum Chowpatty, next to a bunch of pure vegetarian eateries, La Veggie sprawls on two floors. The top floor is a banquet hall. Pleasant, cheerful, well-lit space, black and white flooring et al.The most unpredictable favourite? ‘Pao Bhaji Fondue’. That’s the Jain dish that meets with the Vyas family’s approval. We skewer and dip in the wedges of pao into the fondue of mashed bhaji. It’s amazing how flavoursome it is, in spite of being sans onion and garlic. The paobhaji masala infuses it with flavour. Delicious corn cheese balls, spongy deep-fried spheres, topped with salsa. Crisp butter khichiya, too. They offer non-Jain dishes as well. Like the creative and attractively presented nachos chaat. Triangles of nachos are vertically stacked with tangy chutneys and chaat. Chatpata Chinese, too. Non-Jain crisp lotus stem, sweet and spicy.Plenty of intensely flavoured and delicious mocktails, from frozen margarita and pina colada to the almost neon strawberry.An ambitious menu which zig zags all over the world and attempts to cook global classics in vegetarian and Jain avatars. Falters on many. Hard, biscuity crust pizza with lacklustre toppings. Gloopy overcooked pasta. Tasteless channa bhatura (we try the Jain and non-Jain versions and both are equally lacking in flavour). Overspiced chilli pepper paneer. Ditto for the vegetarian biryani. Oversweet desserts, No alcohol.Centrally located, this Chowpatty restaurant, serves up multi-cuisine global dishes in their Jain and vegetarian avatars. A few (like the ‘Pao Bhaji Fondue’) pass the taste test, others (especially the continental ones) flounder. La Veggie offers a huge menu of Jain options and that is its biggest USP. However, even my Jain-diner guests will not go back in a hurry. It’s not worth a second visit.LA VEGGIEGround Floor, Chowpatty View Building, Opposite Sukh Sagar, Girgaon Chowpatty Area, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel RoadContact: 022 23619393Timing: 11.30 am – 11.30 pmAverage meal for two: Rs.1200",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74596010,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-115708/74596010.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/food-news/restaurant-review-la-veggie/articleshow/74595953.cms

22,['13/03/2020'],Foods that help boost your immune system,"With coronavirus Covid-19 being the talk of the day, much is being said about staying as safe and healthy as possible. While washing your hands, keeping a safe distance from others etc may all be steps to reduce the risk, eating right plays a major role in keeping well, too. One cannot avoid a risk of being affected by the virus, but the right diet is said to support the immune system, so that it is ready to take on anything. Here are a few immune boosting-remedies to load up on...There are several nutrients that you can include in your eating plan and protein ranks high among them at this time. Affirms dietician Sheela Tanna, “Most Mumbaikars are avoiding non-veg because of Corona virus scare and heat. Asian vegetarian food lacks in proteins, which play the role of immunity booster and unfortunately are ignored, too. Every meal must include a protein like dals, pulses (sprouted), paneer, curd, nuts and seeds.”She shares tips to make them. “Make cutlets by mixing paneer with boiled vegetables and spices. It doubles its protein value and can be eaten in burger, sandwich or a roll. Also, mix all the dals and soak, grind and make dosas, chillas, dhoklas or uttapams. You get complete protein (all nine essential amino acids) from vegetarian meals.”The culinary cabinet has a variety of spices that have significant antibacterial and anti-fungal advantages — such as ginger, garlic, cloves, cinnamon, turmeric and cumin, says clinical dietician Zainab Gulamhusein. She gives tips on each:It’s a good idea to include ginger in your milk tea. You can also take lukewarm water and add juliennes of ginger and honey to it. Add ginger to khichdi as well. Ginger plays a powerful role as an antioxoidant. It also reducesbloating and colic pain, too.Brownish cloves or lavang pods are a major part of Ayurvedic medicine. Cloves help treat nausea and flu. Clove oil combats sore gums. To use cloves in the diet, add some to your pulaos and other rice dishes.Haldi or turmeric is almost a super spice having powerful medicinal properties. It is said to increase the body’s antioxidant capacity. Curcumin, its main ingredient has an anti-inflammatory effect. Add it to milk and have it before sleeping. Add it to warm water to reduce itching. Ginger-haldi tea is a remedy for flu. You can use raw turmeric in a pickle form, too.Cinnamon has strong anti-inflammatory properties and can be added to warm water, coffee and desserts. Cinnamon oil reduces aches, joint pains and improves circulation.A popular remedy for colds, it also reduces the risk of blood pressure and heart disease. Raw garlic can be added to juices or as a topping on soups and stews. Mash garlic with olive oil and salt and use it as a dressing.Star anise has antibacterial properties that can keep you away from flu and infections. To make tea, add the pods to hot water, steep, strain and drink. It boosts immunity.Elaborates nutritionist Gunjan Parekh, “Omega-3 fatty acids can reduce inflammation in the body. The lining of the cells is protected by this fatty acid. It thus keeps the immune system in check. It may not directly help with warding off a cold, but it bolsters the immune system, so when there is a viral attack the body is prepared. The omega-3-rich foods include flax seeds (unroasted, powdered) that can be added to soups and salads. Have walnuts and oily fish (such as mackerel and tuna).”One of the best ways to stay healthy is by purging toxins from the system. While eating the right foods helps, one can also optimise the liver functioning and aid the digestive system by drinking healthy detox juices. This in turn, bolsters the immune system. Try chugging down these juices today:Nutrient-dense kale provides one of the best ways to fortify the immune system.Aids blood clotting, boosts heart health and bone developmentHas powerful antioxidants that lower risk of heart disease and inflammationRich source of vitamin C. It also has calcium, which contributes to bone health.Offers antioxidant protection and lowers risk of heart disease and stroke",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74595784,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-25233/74595784.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/food-news/foods-that-help-boost-your-immune-system/articleshow/74595584.cms

Namaste

Wuhan shake

Elbow bump

Thai Wai

There’s a lot of dos and don’ts making the rounds as the fear of coronavirus — Covid-19 outbreak spread everywhere. While sanitising hands and sneezing etiquette is key, people are also being advised to avoid shaking hands with anyone as a form of greeting. This has led to several interesting alternatives to say hello cropping up around the world.It started earlier this month when a video surfaced from Wuhan (the Chinese city at the epicenter of the virus outbreak). It showed two men in masks greeting each other by tapping their feet instead of shaking hands and embracing. The video carried the caption: “I love how people can adapt and keep a sense of humour about stressful situations.” Since then, it’s gone viral with a vengeance, getting others to try it.John Magufuli, president of Tanzania, greeted a colleague with a foot-shake. A video also showed Russian energy minister Alexander Novak performing a ‘foot shake’ with an oil company head. It’s also sparking other cool, hands-free ways to greet someone.On the heels of the foot shake is the elbow bump. Bulgarian economist Kristalina Georgieva and World Bank Group President David Malpass bumped elbows at the end of a press briefing on COVID-19 in Washington. The England cricket team will be opting for fist-bumps instead of handshakes during their Sri Lanka tour, starting March 19. NBA players also chose to fist-bump over their signature high-fives to be safe in these times.A Canadian government site recommends an ‘elbow bump’ or a friendly wave as it is “less likely to expose you to respiratory viruses”. It got Hillary Clinton to dub the precautionary elbow bump as the ‘corona shake’. Taking a cue from it, Hollywood actress Sandra Bullock was seen greeting her friend with her elbow in LA, two days ago.Along with the Indian namaste, the gesture of ‘Thai Wai’ which entails a slight bow with the palms pressed together, is also being suggested as a way of greeting people.This March, there were no handshakes from the Queen as she held an audience at Buckingham Palace amid the coronavirus outbreak. Later at the Commonwealth service, the Prince of Wales opted for a namaste, while Harry bumped elbows with musician Craig David. “It’s very odd not shaking hands, I try my best to hold my hands like that,” Prince Wiliam was quoted as saying.Prince Charles also adopted the Indian gesture of namaste to greet guests at the Prince's Trust awards. Last week, Queen Maxima and King Willem-Alexander of The Netherlands, who visited Jakarta on a state visit to Indonesia, also did not shake hands because of coronavirus.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74593906,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-29190/74593906.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/coronavirusconcerns-royalty-celebs-ditch-the-handshake/articleshow/74593457.cms

In the last few weeks, many events were turned into ‘digital only’to avoid any health risks.Apart from business launches and conferences that went online to stay on schedule, the art and music world also went digital to reach out to fans despite the threat of coronavirus. Leading the way here was K-pop band BTS which decided to live stream a press conference promoting their new album. Keeping in mind the coronavirus outbreak, the band livestreamed the conference from an empty hall last month and urged fans to take care of themselves, the members waving and bowing to an empty hall and answering previously selected questions from journalists. ""Health is always on our mind these days and our messages of facing your inner self and loving yourself is ultimately possible when you’re healthy. Especially since it is very risky outside these days, I hope you take care of your health,"" singer Jimin was quoted as saying. The K-pop megastars also cancelled four Seoul concerts due in April.As per reports, many K-pop celebrities are resorting to online fan meets and streaming concerts to communicate with their fans. Baek Ye-rin met fans through YouTube livestreaming after her performance in Head In The Clouds festival was cancelled in Jakarta recently and Taeyeon, a member of Girls Generation, decided to have an online fan meet for the release of her new songs.Determined to keep going after the coronavirus forced Venice's ornate opera house, La Fenice, to cancel its performances, recently, a string quartet gathered in the empty, eerily silent theater and played Beethoven, streaming the concert online and winning an ovation of handclap emojis.The outbreak also forced the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra to cancel all of its concerts in February and March, leaving its musicians working from home.

His latest music video saw him making an entry on the screen in shimmery silver shoes. The ace musician and composer credited his wife, Saira Banu, for his styling. He said, “She would complain a lot about my outfits and styling. So, these days, I just accept whatever she picks because it makes her happy. She has friends in New York and Los Angeles and suitcases full of clothes keep coming home (laughs!).”The Oscar-winning composer recently worked on a project where he had to mentor other musicians. Talking about the time when he was being mentored years ago, Rahman told us, “I have been mentored a thousand times. First, it was my Carnatic music teachers and my father (RK Shekhar). Then, there were people like Mani Ratnam and Shekhar Kapur. Also, there was Andrew Lloyd Webber (English composer), who believed that I could write music. The idea is to always keep learning. Whenever we think that we know something new, that ‘something new’ stagnates. Inquisitiveness and the constant search for knowledge are what keep you going; without that nothing exists.”Rahman says that since he started his training in music early in his life, he had a hard time as a student in school. “I was a bad student, because I was also working when I was studying in school. I would often get scolded for my poor attendance. I would work through the night, and in the morning, I would be at the studio,” he recalled.Rahman, who has won two Grammy Awards for Slumdog Millionaire (2008), said that the prestigious international music award is just the roof, and one should aim for the sky. Citing the example of the Korean music industry, he said, “There is this famous saying, ‘Aim for the sky and you will reach the ceiling. Aim for the ceiling, and you will stay on the floor.’ One should have high aspirations and be ambitions. Look at the way Koreans are spending millions on marketing their music, and today, their music is almost mainstream. Everybody is talking about BTS — the South Korean boy band! I don’t even understand that music, but it’s so popular. Now, they seem to have taken over the movies, too, what with Parasite winning big at the Oscars.”Like his son, AR Ameen, Rahman’s daughters, Khatija and Raheema, are also musically inclined. Last year, they performed on the stage for the first time with their father at the U2 concert in Mumbai. “They are taking music more seriously now. They never expected to be on stage along with me at the U2 concert. We are a musical family, and I believe that their musical education is very important.

They died from within, everysingle moment of their lives. And then, they rose together, louder than before, gracefully fighting to rekindle the dwindling light of hope. ‘ Even Mists Have Silver Linings ’ encapsulates this struggle of the LGBTQIA+ community, and it does so beautifully through a series of emotionally-charged vignettes.A dark, minimalistic set awaits the audience. And on the misty stage, sitting upright, are seven powerful actors who effortlessly don multiple hats, one after the other. Using symbolism as a tool, the gender non-conforming adventurists drive the plot with their heart-wrenching monologues. There’s confusion looming in their minds, for they struggle to comprehend their own emotions. What makes this play painfully inspiring is how they come to terms with everything despite the chaos.The collaborative efforts of Jeffrey Pufahl, Victor Thoudam, Will Weigler and Vikram Phukan yields great results in terms of how they have hand-picked multiple stories and weaved them together into this one sharply executed play. Music and lighting have been used effectively to transition from one scene to another. Among the series of tales, there is one that traces the journey of a transgender parent who is shunned by his family. A woman, in another scene, shares an intimate moment with her neighbour, and begins to question her sexual orientation. Then, there’s a husband who loses his wife to another woman. Amid all these episodes, the charmingly humourous characters discuss mythology, gender fluidity, emotional unavailability and a lot more. Overall, ‘Even Mists Have Silver Linings’ is a play that touches every aspect that divides and confines thecommunity.This 100-minute long drama is an Indo-US collaborative project, aiming to sensitise people towards the LGBTQIA+ community, and it is promising enough to start a relevant dialogue, and hopefully, bring about a positive change in the society.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74595832,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-55521/74595832.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/theatre/theatre-review-even-mists-have-silver-linings/articleshow/74595718.cms
32,['13/03/2020'],Bollywood actresses talk about their super-dads!,"Director Homi Adajania’s Angrezi Medium , as the film’s trailer shows, revolves around the herat-warming bond between a father and daughter. Champak Bansal (Irrfan), a doting dad, goes all out to fulfil his ambitious daughter Tarika’s (Radhika Madan) dreams while dodging the hurdles that come along the way.While the trailer has received a thumbs up from viewers, it also seems to have grabbed the attention of the doting daughters of Bollywood. Ahead of the film’s release, Anushka Sharma Kriti Sanon , Kiara Advani, Ananya Panday and Radhika Madan talk about their bond with their dads and tell us why they think of their fathers as super-dads!

Anushka Sharma: I can cry at the drop of a hat when I am talking about my father, that’s the kind of love I feel for him. He has always let me be. The only advice he gave me was to do the right thing in life. He didn’t put any boundaries around me. I hope every girl can have the same kind of relationship that I share with my dad.

Alia Bhatt: My super-dad moment happens every day. My father makes it a point to send me a message every morning; it is always something that he’s read — a quote or a picture that he has come across. It makes me realise how fantastic my father is and how he cares to pass on these little words of wisdom.

Kiara Advani: My dad’s my superhero. He’s the reason I am in the film industry; without his support, I wouldn’t have had the confidence to be who I am. So, thank you, dad. Thank you for helping me fly and being the wind beneath my wings. Love you always.

Kriti Sanon: I don’t think that there is any one incident that I can pinpoint. My father was scared when I came to Mumbai to try my luck in films, but he still supported me like a rock. To this day, even for a small issue like my WiFi not working, the first thing I do is call my dad. He sorts all my problems out and that’s why he is my super-dad.

Ananya Panday: My dad is a super-dad. Throughout my growing-up years, he has done more than I could ever imagine, for both my younger sister and me. He is constantly smiling and joking and is an inspiration because he has always been himself and lets me be, too. Whenever people say that I’m like my father, I feel that it’s the best compliment somebody can give me.

Radhika Madan: When I first received a call from Mumbai, asking me to give an audition, my mother was skeptical. It was my father who supported the idea and came along with me. He stood outside production houses whenever I gave auditions. His only concern was if acting would make me happy. Once he realised that it would, he supported me unconditionally and that’s what makes him a super-dad.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74594839,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-80299/74594839.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/bollywood-actresses-talk-about-their-super-dads/articleshow/74594839.cms

34,['13/03/2020'],"Not just creative, now go eco-friendly with sustainable gift-wrapping","As people are increasingly leaning towards a more eco-friendly lifestyle, sustainable gift-wrapping is another green practice that some have adopted. Last year, before Diwali and Christmas, sustainable gift markets were organised in multiple cities wherein workshops were conducted to teach people to reuse material for wrapping gifts. Chintan, an environmental research and action group based in Delhi, states that plastic – the fastest growing industry in India – accounts for 49% of all packaging material, becoming the single largest packaging material. Therefore, it is important to go for sustainable gift-wrapping not just during festivals but for birthdays and anniversaries as well. Wondering what materials you can use? Here’s your guide to sustainable gift-wrapping:Those who encourage and organise sustainable practices in their societies say that in the last two years, the trend in gift-wrapping has shifted towards sustainable options. Ruby Makhija, a 47-year-old opthalmologist and resident of Navjeevan Vihar, who teaches her society members to use household items for gift wraps, says, ""Not just individuals, but even corporates prefer eco-friendly options for gift wraps. Just by looking around at home, one can find several gift-wrapping options. Extra items at our homes can also make for beautiful customised wraps."" She adds, ""We advise people to use newspapers for packaging because they are the best gift-wrapping alternative. Additionally, pages from discarded books and music sheets can also be used as gift wraps. Colourful washi tapes can also be used to add some colour.""Brown paper, baskets, mason jars can also be used for wrapping gifts. Sarthak, a 35-year-old software developer, who volunteers for such workshops, says, ""Now, a number of shops use brown papers for grocery packaging, and they can be decorated with ribbons for gift wraps. Also, baskets are a sustainable option for gifts because these can be re-used. Rather than buying ribbons, look for washi tapes as these decorative washi tapes come in a wide range of patterns, colours and are a sustainable alternative to ribbons. Cartons and cardboard boxes can also be reused and decorated instead of using a wrapping paper. If the box is plain, it can be embellished with decorative items.""28-year-old Chhavi Pandey, who works for a company that provides customised gifts and gift wrap options shares, ""There are numerous gift-wrappingalternatives. For instance, Furoshiki is a Japanese wrapping cloth used for packing, and it has become quite popular in India recently. For Lohri and Diwali, we had several requests to wrap gifts using cloth. If one is doing it at home, they can use scarves because they make for pretty options.""- Newspapers are the best choice for gift-wrapping. You can also use red threads and ribbons to make it look fancy. One can also use jute threads.- Discarded music sheets and pages from old books also make forsimple yet creative and sustainable packaging.- Old clothes and scarves can also be cut to make gift wraps.

NEW DELHI: The number of confirmed Covid-19 patients in India rose to 74 on Thursday with 57 Indians and 17 foreigners testing positive for the virus while the government maintained there was ""no community transmission observed"" so far and urged people to follow advisories and not panic.India has so far witnessed local transmission of coronavirus infection where people with travel history have passed on the virus to others who came in contact. However, a further spread to others in the community is considered critical as it poses greater challenges to contain transmission which has been seen in many other countries and is called ""community transmission"".In separate responses in Lok Sabha on Thursday, civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri, external affairs minister S Jaishankar and health minister Harsh Vardhan assured that several steps were being taken to contain the virus, bring back Indians in vulnerable countries and ensure swift clearances at airports.Explaining the decision to suspend most visas, imposing a quarantine on India, Jaishankar said ""exceptional situations require exceptional response"". Allaying fears of opposition MPs, the minister said Indians abroad were being assisted and efforts were underway to bring them back safely.Puri told DMK's Dayanidhi Maran that he has personally supervised clearance timings at airports and waiting did not exceed 30 minutes at the most. Vardhan said intensive contact tracing was on and Jaishankar said 6,000 Indians were in Iran.""Luckily, in India, we do not have any community transmission. We have only a few cases that have come from outside and they have primarily affected their close family members,"" Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry, said in a briefing.The government is working on a war footing to tackle spread of the virus, which has reached around 114 countries and infected over a lakh people. The World Health Organisation has declared it a global pandemic.Around 1,500 people have been put under observation who came in contact with 74 positive cases tested so far, whereas over 30,000 people across the country are under community surveillance.In a precautionary move, the government on Wednesday suspended all visas for a month, except a few like diplomatic, UN organisations and employment visas. The government had on Wednesday informed of 60 positive cases in the country.While 948 people have been evacuated and quarantined for 14 days, around 130-150 Indians are likely to be evacuated from Iran by Saturday, a senior official from the civil aviation ministry said. The government will undertake three such evacuations to bring back Indians stranded there.""The first from Iran will reach Mumbai airport around 12.30pm tomorrow. The second will be on March 15 and arrive at Delhi airport. The third is likely to be on March 16 or 17,"" the official said.The 83 evacuees from Italy who arrived in India on Wednesday have been housed at the Manesar quarantine facility. All patients in hospitals are being treated and reported to be stable, officials said. Till now, 11,14,025 people have been screened at 30 designated airports in India, the health ministry said.“India has said that if people from certain countries are coming here, they have to go through quarantine – in certain cases compulsory quarantine and in some cases discretionary quarantine – and Indian citizens who are coming back will obviously come back to quarantine conditions if required,” Jaishankar told Lok Sabha.“It is absolutely essential that we react responsibly and soberly. An excessive sense of alarm would only be to the detriment of those who are really in need,” he added.The government, he said, had decided to make provision for testing primarily for students in Italy and collect samples. Those tested negative will be allowed to travel and will be quarantined on arrival in India for 14 days.Vardhan said reports that people were not screened were incorrect and India had been able to trace every person who tested positive even after they had not shown positive during screening.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74602755,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-76067,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-dont-panic-no-community-transmission-of-coronavirus-yet/articleshow/74602683.cms

Besides, three more infected cases have been cured, according to the latest health ministry data on Thursday.Researchers in India have secured 11 isolates of coronavirus – which is a prime requisite for doing any kind of research related to viruses. However, there are other potential hazards that researchers will have to overcome before initiating trials.“There are two ways of going for vaccine preparation. One is either you look at the sequences of the gene which then may lead to development of antibodies, or you actually have the strain and then you try to develop a vaccine which is always an easier option,” said Raman R Gangakhedkar, head of the Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases-I (ECD-I) division of ICMR.He added that though coronavirus is difficult to isolate but the efforts of scientists of National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune have been successful and about 11 isolates of coronavirus are available.According to Gangakhedkar, vaccine development takes long time. Besides, very less is known about this particular virus and certain viruses behave in unusual manner, indicating the path may not be easier and a breakthrough may take some time.“We have to also understand that even if you provide vaccine to prevent infection, when the infection tends to occur, there could be a flare-up. So, if you actually look at it, we need to factor the part that it could take a long time, and there could be potential hazards; the reality is, the virus is here. First, we must try to prevent it as much as possible, contain it and wait for things to happen,” he added.India has tested around 6,200 samples so far with a focus on contact tracing.

43,['13/03/2020'],"Amit Shah: 1,922 involved in Delhi riots identified","NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Thursday said Delhi Police, with the help of facial recognition software, had identified 1,922 rioters who could be seen burning, attacking and killing people in videos and social media footage and policemen were looking for them.Replying to a debate in the Rajya Sabha on the Delhi riots , Shah said the perpetrators had been identified by a detailed scrutiny of videos, including those accessed by the media, and by trawling through the database of driving licences and voter IDs of Delhi and four adjoining districts of Uttar Pradesh. Forty special teams were assigned to track down the suspects, he added.The home minister blamed the violence on the insecurity of Muslims because of the false propaganda on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the exercise to update the National Population Register (NPR).He said it was time that all political parties joined hands to dispel doubts that CAA was meant to strip a particular section of citizenship or that the citizenship of individuals would be called into doubt if they were unable to provide details sought during the NPR update.“Enough is enough. Let us come together to remove the doubts,” Shah said as he offered to host a delegation of opposition parties led by leader of opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad to allay their suspicions.“Muslims are being misled that they will lose their citizenship. Let me tell you no one’s citizenship is being taken away. This law is only meant to give citizenship. No one from the minority community, our Muslim brothers and sisters, should believe any rumours,” Shah said.When Congress member Kapil Sibal said the problem lay in NPR procedures and the questions enumerators would ask, Shah said, “No documents will be asked for NPR. Moreover, people are free to fill up the information on the NPR form that they have and leave columns that they don’t want to fill up. No one will be put in the ‘D’ (doubtful) category.”The appeal for collaboration followed a sharp debate in which opposition members attacked the government for the riots which they said was a fallout of BJP’s communal politics.In his reply, Shah alternated between aggression and reasonableness. Like in the Lok Sabha, he deployed details to defend Delhi Police against charges of failure and inaction, built his case about misleading and provocative statements made by those opposed to the CAA being the trigger for the riots and vowed to punish the guilty.“Those who think they can get away by disappearing are mistaken. We will smoke them out,” he said and promised that the government would punish the rioters irrespective of their caste, religion and political affiliation.Shah defended the use of facial recognition software to identify the rioters. While saying that Delhi Police would adhere to the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court for protection of privacy and would not use Aadhaar data to identify the guilty, he asked whether those accused of killing, arson and violence could invoke the right to privacy. “No one should be bothered about privacy rights of those who have killed people and damaged property,” he said.Reiterating that the riots were a conspiracy, he said, “We had information prior to February 24 that money has been brought from abroad and even domestic channels and distributed among people. We started investigation but unfortunately, the riots happened. Five persons have been arrested for the crime so far.”As for the charge that the riots were a “state-sponsored” project, he asked why any government would engineer such violence when the world’s most powerful person, US President Donald Trump, was being hosted by the prime minister.Shah took on the opposition over hate speeches, claiming speeches at Ramlila Maidan on December 14 against CAA manifested in protests the next day at Shaheen Bagh. “We are not against peaceful protests. People can protest but there is a place for it. Here, it is about public inconvenience,” Shah said in the context of Shaheen Bagh.He also defended his party’s record on communal riots, saying 76% of deaths in riots were occurred during Congress rule. He listed riots that happened post-Independence and said it was “not in the nature of BJP to instigate riots but to check them”.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74602923,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-890471,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/1922-involved-in-delhi-riots-identified-shah/articleshow/74602922.cms
44,['13/03/2020'],No law allows posting protesters’ photos: SC on 'recovery' hoardings,"The controversial hoardings were put up in Lucknow

NEW DELHI: Questioning the UP government for putting up posters to name and shame anti-CAA protesters who allegedly indulged in violence and destruction of public property, the Supreme Court on Thursday said there was no law to back such action and referred the issue to a three-judge bench to study it next week.

Hearing an appeal filed by the UP government challenging the Allahabad HC order which directed it to remove the roadside posters of protesters forthwith, a bench of Justices U U Lalit and Aniruddha Bose accepted the plea that a person indulging in violence in public gaze waives his right to privacy but asked how a government could take such action which amounts to castigating a person for ever.

Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for UP, said the state had examined the role of 95 people and came to the conclusion that 57 of them were responsible for vandalism during anti-CAA protests and they were asked to pay compensation for loss of property as per the SC’s 2009 verdict.

The bench said though it understood the anxiety of the state government but there is no law as of now to back its action on the issue. “Do you want us to pass direction in addition to the SC’s earlier order?” the bench said, indicating that its 2009 verdict does not allow such action of “naming and shaming” of protesters.

Senior advocates A M Singhvi, Colin Gonsalves and C U Singh, appearing for the protesters, contended that putting posters could provoke people to target, hit and lynch them and their family members for raising voice against the Centre and state government. Singhvi, appearing for 1972 batch-retired IPS officer SR Darapuri whose photos with personal details had appeared on the posters, said such action could not be taken against any person even if convicted in the gravest offence of child rape and murder.

The bench, after hearing both sides, said the issue is of great importance and it has to be adjudicated as early as possible by a three-judge bench. Without staying the operation of the HC verdict, the bench directed that the matter be placed before the CJI to set up a three-judge bench to hear the case next week.

It also allowed all the protesters, whose picture and addresses were put on hoardings, to file impleadment application in the case.

However, the virus has nothing to do with consumption of poultry products. Indians cook food at a very high temperature, which kills all forms of viruses present in it. Hence, consumption of properly cooked food is totally safe.” Dr Kumar, however, said raw meat should not be consumed.Meanwhile, poultry traders said chicken sales were badly hit owing to the covid-19 scare. Aditya, owner of a wholesale poultry farm at Phulwarisharif, said chicken sales have gone down by 30-35% owing to the virus threat.“We have been receiving fewer orders these days. Even our permanent customers, who sell chicken and eggs at different places in the city, have stopped placing orders in bulk,” he said.Munna Alam, a chicken-seller on Bailey Road said, “I used to sell at least 20-25 chickens per day. Now, the sales have come down to 10 chickens per day. Even during Holi, very few customers turned up at my shop.”Many locals also said they have started avoiding non-veg food, especially eggs and chicken. “We still don’t know about the reason behind the spread of coronavirus.

The innovation hub will emphasize on speech, video and text analytics.

The department of science and technology (DST), government of India, will bear the entire cost of around Rs 90 crore for the project which will be completed in the next five years.

In a letter to IIT-Patna director Pushpak Bhattacharyya, the DST said, “The DST has completed the scrutiny process and shortlisted your institute as one of the host institutes (HIs) for establishment of a TIH. The Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) will release initial grant of Rs 7 crore to the institute for establishment of innovation hub on receipt of the acceptance form.”

It further said, “HI is requested to work out the budget in detailed project report (DPR) and it should not be more than (+ or – 10%) of the budget that HI has proposed in the initial proposal submitted to SERB.”

The innovation hub will come up on 30,000sq feet area, which is to be identified by the institute on its sprawling campus.

Sriparna Saha, associate dean of research and development, IIT-Patna, said a committee would be set up by the institute on March 13 to prepare the DPR for innovation hub.

“The purpose of the innovation hub is to develop technology to solve the real life problems. It will focus on technology development, skill development, innovation, entrepreneurship, startup plans and international collaboration. Under skill development, students will get MTech, post-doctoral and PhD fellowship,” Saha said.

The initial proposal for technology hub was prepared by 30 faculty members from different departments of IIT-Patna.

Meghna, professor-in-charge, public relations of IIT-Patna, said, “This is an extremely proud moment for us and we expect this to also impact the technology development and nurturing atmosphere in Bihar.”

“The NM-ICPS is a comprehensive mission aimed at complete convergence with all stakeholders by establishing strong linkages between academia, industry, government and international organizations,” Meghna added.

Instead of getting intimidated, people in the city should create awareness and educate each other about the virus. People are panicking and adding to the mass hysteria with little or no knowledge of how the virus spreads,” said a senior doctor at the PMCH virology department.He added: “We are only considering people who have returned from affected countries or those who have been in direct contact with a Covid-19 patient. A normal cold or flu can’t turn out to be Covid-19 until and unless there has been some connection with a positive case.”Amid the global spread of the novel coronavirus, the state health department has identified six government hospitals for setting up quarantine facilities to combat this highly infectious disease. Health officials said all 38 districts have been linked to medical college and hospitals for collecting samples and providing isolation facilities to Covid-19 suspects.Altogether 10 beds have been designated to provide quarantine facilities to the suspects of Covid-19 at the PMCH.Sharing similar views, Krishna Gopal, medical superintendent at Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) said, “There has been a surge in people seeking help for normal flu and common cold in the last few weeks.

48,['13/03/2020'],Congress slams RJD Bihar chief over ‘fake’ letter jibe,"PATNA: RJD state president Jagadanand Singh describing Bihar Congress incharge Shakti Sinh Gohil’s letter seeking a Rajya Sabha berth for his party as ‘farzi (fake)’ has not gone down well with the grand old party.

The Congress reacted sharply on Thursday after the RJD announced the names of its two nominees for the Rajya Sabha. On being contacted, Gohil said, “I had written the letter and it was delivered to the person concerned. Hence the question of calling the letter ‘farzi’ doesn’t arise.”

Echoing similar views, Congress MLC and AICC media panelist Prem Chandra Mishra said, “He (Jagadanand Singh) should not have spoken like this. I am not sure whether he was aware of it (letter) or not, but he should have refrained from making such comments. Making ‘derogatory’ remarks is against ‘gathbandhan dharma’.”

The remarks of the RJD state president came in the wake of Congress Bihar incharge Gohil’s open letter to its major ally reminding of its “promise” of giving one Rajya Sabha seat to the Congress at an appropriate time. The promise, Congress claimed, was made by RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav during the seat sharing talks for 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

When reminded of Gohil’s open letter, Jagadanand said, “The open letter is addressed to somebody in particular. It seems to be ‘farzi’.” Jagadanand’s remarks came soon after the names of the two RJD candidates for Rajya Sabha — Prem Chand Gupta and Amrendra Dhari Singh — were announced by the party.

Earlier in the open letter, Gohil had appealed to the RJD to fulfil its “promise”. Gohil wrote, “During the joint press conference of the leaders of the Grand Alliance at the time of Lok Sabha elections, Tejashwi had clearly said that one seat of Rajya Sabha from RJD quota would be left for Congress. It is said that ‘pran jaye par vachan na jaye’. Hopefully RJD will follow its promise.”

Sources in the Congress said the issue of denial of a Rajya Sabha seat was resolved after the intervention of top leadership of the two alliance partners. “A request came from the top RJD leadership that the party might lose its recognition if the number of seats in the Upper House is reduced to four from existing five. Hence, the request was accepted,” a top Congress functionary said.

Earlier in the day, Tejashwi had ruled out differences with the Congress over the issue. He had said, “There is going to be no problem as the candidates have been decided taking Sonia Gandhi and Lalu Prasad, who share a deep personal bonding, into confidence.”

50,['13/03/2020'],Covid-19: Startup takes staff from B’luru to a TN farm to write codes,"Chennai: Fearing disruptions due to Covid-19, employees of VuMonic, a data analytics and market insights startup, ran away from Koramangala to work out of a cashew farm in a remote village in Thevaram (in TN) to release an important update (patch) for its ‘Insta Clean’ app which has more than 7 lakh users.

VuMonic moved its operations lock-stock-and-barrel to co-founder Aravind Raju’s farm house nestled in the foothills of the Western Ghats. The reason: it was secluded and far away from congested big cities where people are more vulnerable to getting infected by Coronavirus. “We had an important release for ‘Insta Clean’, an email cleaning app, due for Monday. Last week, we had a few colleagues reporting sick and we were tense. That’s when we decided to move to Thevaram,” he told TOI over the phone from his farm. “Work from home is not feasible for small start-ups like ours. It works for large companies. We have to work in teams and in tandem. We had no choice and looking at the panic around Bengaluru, we moved a small group first and the entire team this week,” he said.

Of course, there were issues. “Connectivity was poor. But that was hardly a problem, as most of our work does not require internet connectivity. On the flip side, we are seeing some very interesting changes in the lifestyle of my colleagues,” he said. The team connects to the net through a wi-fi that is available in the farm.

For one, they are up for work at 7 am, as most farm hands start work pretty early in the day and they wind up by 3 pm or so. Post that, evenings are spent either going for a swim in the Periyar river or hiking in the Western Ghats. Food is prepared by a local village cook and comprises local cuisine.

In short: the verdant settings of a mountain, a flowing river, chirping birds. Well that is, a post card photo frame that decorates the walls of an office or a house is now a work spot to sort out market insights issues.

While the picturesque Thevaram was the first choice, the other option was to work from Sakleshpur in Karnataka. “I was comfortable with my farm,” said Raju, a engineering graduate from Lord Venkateswara College of Engineering near Chennai. The team consists of a Nigerian, a Sri Lankan and others from India. “We have one colleague from Vellore and no one else is from Tamil Nadu,” he said. For now, the team has not decided on when they would return to their base in Bengaluru.

51,['13/03/2020'],"Benches, fountains at Central Square in 3 months","Chennai: In a few weeks, the city will get a new getaway spot where adults could relax by pruned lawns and children could play next to water fountains. A part of the Central Square will be ready with the area above Central Metro station in front of Moore Market Complex, Victoria Hall and Ripon Building getting lawns, walkways and benches. The Rs 400cr project aims to develop a landmark that will facilitate a multi-modal transport system and encourage pedestrians to use underground facilities.

“Much of it will be ready in three months. Our idea is to develop the area into a major landmark in the city,” said a metro rail official.

By mid-2020, the area will have black-tiled concrete benches, ground-level water fountains with tiny sprinklers, decorative lights along the rims of the benches and elevators of Central metro. While the open area above Central Metro in front of Moore Market Complex will have facilities for people relax and children to play, the space in front of Victoria Hall and Ripon Building, which was taken over during construction of Central Metro, will be laid with lawns and benches.

“We will demolish a part of the compound wall around Victoria Hall and build a raised pedestrian crossing to link it with the open area around Central Metro. This raised crossing will allow vehicles to slow down while pedestrians cross,” an official said.

While much of the beautification work is expected to be ready by mid-2020, officials said a major part of the Central Square project which includes an underground parking and two new pedestrian subways is likely to be ready in one year.

The construction of a three-level underground parking that can accommodate more than 800 cars is underway near the Park suburban station. Once the parking lot is ready, a 20-storey Central Plaza with bays for private and government buses, passenger amenities, shopping area and office space will be built. Contract for the construction of Central Plaza will be floated separately, an official said.

Apart from a renovated pedestrian subway and another new subway linking Central Metro, which are open for the public, construction is on for two other pedestrian subways linking Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital with Central and Evening Bazaar Road and Central Railway Station with the bridge opposite.

Once the square comes up, passengers alighting from any train or bus can have easy access to other transport facilities for their onward journeys either through walkways or pedestrian subways. Passengers could also park their vehicles in the underground parking facility before they board a train or bus to travel outstation.

Passenger vehicles were down just over 1% at 2,28,959 units but that was the only segment in the red last month.

Two wheelers were up 1.5% at 12.8 lakh units while three wheelers were up nearly 21% at 65,752 units. Pre-BS6 buying and discounts helped trucks and buses show a 13% increase in retail sales at 92,805 units.

Tractors were up 13.5% at 41,485 units.

“February turned positive for retail sales as the entire auto eco system, especially auto dealers, focussed on liquidation of BS-4 Stocks. Rural sales contributed for retail sales with tractors showing double digit increase for the second month in a row,” said FADA president Ashish Harsharaj Kale.

On the inventory front, two wheeler inventory of BS-4 vehicles remains a very serious concern for FADA, said Kale. While PV and CV inventory is at 10-12 and 10-15 days respectively, for two wheelers it is 20-25 days. “FADA survey reveals a very high number of two wheeler dealers will not be able to fully liquidate their BS-4 inventory and expressed inadequate support from their OEMs for 100% liquidation of this stock,” he added.

Rajkot: Tension gripped Jafrabad town of Amreli after two groups of different communities clashed and indulged in stone pelting on Wednesday night. Police rounded up as many as 59 people after three cops were injured in the incident, that erupted after small accident.

The clash sparked after Sandeep Shiyal and Imran Mansoori entered into an altercation after Mansoori’s bike rammed into Shiyal’s car.

“Supporters of both Shiyal and Mansoori gathered at the spot and started pelting stones at each other,” said H H Shengalia, a woman sub-inspector with Jafrabad town police station who was injured in the incident. “When we arrived the rioters also attacked us,” she added.

Also injured was P D Kalsaria, a head constable with the same police station.

As the situation spiralled out of control, Shengalia sent an SOS to Jafrabad marine police station, Rajula police station and Vanda police station which sent re-enforcements. The cops had to resort to caning to disperse the warring groups.

Meanwhile, the police have booked 2,000 people from both the groups for rioting, damaging public properties, loot and preventing the police from performing their duty.

“We are searching for the main culprits who had incited the violence,” added Shengalia.

56,['13/03/2020'],"SBI clears plan to put Rs 7,250cr in Yes Bank","Mumbai: The board of State Bank of India ( SBI ) on Thursday approved a proposal to invest Rs 7,250 crore in Yes Bank by purchasing 725 crore shares. The approval is subject to the condition that the public-sector lender’s holding will remain within 49% of the paid-up capital of Yes Bank.

While the amount is higher than the Rs 2,450 crore indicated earlier in the RBI ’s draft plan, it is lower than the Rs 10,000 crore that SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar had said that the bank was willing to infuse in the troubled private lender.

Also, if the purchase of 725 crore shares is intended to help SBI acquire a 49% stake, the total capital-raising is unlikely to be more than Rs 15,000 crore. The paid-up capital could go higher than Rs 15,000 crore if SBI allows its stake to fall below 49% and other investors — including private banks — pick up a stake of at least 35%.

Given that the private lender’s authorised capital has been raised to Rs 5,000 crore by the RBI, Yes Bank can raise an additional Rs 10,000 crore even after SBI’s Rs 7,250-crore investment. Of this, there is a likelihood that Rs 1,750 crore could come from the conversion of additional tier-1 bonds with investors agreeing to the conversion.

In its reconstruction scheme for Yes Bank, the RBI said that the investor would need to invest in the equity of the reconstructed bank to the extent that post-infusion it holds 49% at a price of not less than Rs 10 per share of Rs 2.

Shares of Yes Bank, which were on the upswing after RBI’s reconstruction plan, slipped 13% on Thursday in line with the global market collapse. Shares of the private lender closed at Rs 25, which values the bank at Rs 6,389 crore — more than twice RBI’s valuation of the private lender under its reconstruction scheme.

Besides SBI, private lenders including HDFC group, ICICI Bank group, Kotak Group and private investors like Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and R K Damani are expected to participate.

Meanwhile, India Ratings in a report said that the delays in resuming normal services could impact the near-term liquidity of some of the bank’s customers. Also, corporate groups with a large dependency on the bank could face a longer period of disruption. “These disruptions could stem from their usage of Yes Bank as a lender for facilities such as cash credit, letters of credit (LCs), bank guarantees (BGs) and other working capital facilities as well as a term debt provider. The moratorium is also likely to impact the liquidity cushion available with many corporates in form of deposits and investments parked with Yes Bank,” India Ratings said.

This would be the direct impact of the travel bans and spreading quarantine that have disrupted operations in the face of the Covid-19 epidemic.The sector — which entirely depends on travel, trade and tourism — has seen massive room cancellations this month. Upscale hotels in India’s political and financial capitals New Delhi and Mumbai are operating below 40% of their capacities. With companies in many coronavirus-affected countries, including India, adopting work-from-home and no-travel policies, the scenario looks grim for the hospitality industry in the immediate term. The sector is hoping the virus threat reduces by June or July and business picks up in the second half of the year.Some global chains like Hilton are temporarily closing properties in coronavirus-hit US cities. However, in India, lodging players have no plans to shut down operations even as they stare at empty rooms and no check-ins.“The large-scale cancellations of room bookings in recent weeks have eroded the ability of hotels to operate without piling up worrisome losses. The absence of new business on books is only adding to the grim story ahead,” said Achin Khanna, managing partner of consulting firm Hotelivate. “If normalcy does not return in the second half of the year, then 2020 will be the worst performing year for the hospitality industry since the 2008 financial crisis.”According to Hotelivate, branded hotels could lose about $2 billion in revenues this year — an erosion of over 30% compared to what was clocked in 2019. The lodging sector could see an additional revenue loss of $4 billion if bed-and-breakfasts, guesthouses and unorganised hotels are included. “We are seeing fewer guests. Occupancies have dipped by 30%,” said Fern Hotels chairman Param Kannampilly. “If the business situation worsens due to the outbreak, then we may be forced to close certain outlets.” Pubs, gyms, spas and swimming pools are already shut at Accor Hotels and other luxe chains after the government’s social distancing directive to slow the transmission of coronavirus Facing pressure, the industry has been pushing for relief from the government to stem financial loss and human toll.

The announcement came as the rupee hit a lifetime low of 74.48 in intra-day trades in the interbank market, in line with the rout in equity markets.With state-owned banks selling dollars, the rupee recovered to close at 74.22, which was 58 paise lower than Wednesday. One positive news was the improvement in the country’s current account deficit (CAD), which narrowed sharply to $1.4 billion, or 0.2% of the GDP, for the December 2019 quarter as against 2.7% a year ago and 0.9% in the preceding quarter. However, with equity markets suffering their worst loss over fears of the coronavirus pandemic triggering a recession, overall sentiment was negative.“The RBI is closely and continuously monitoring the rapidly evolving global situation and spillovers. It stands ready to take all necessary measures to ensure that the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Indian economy are mitigated, and financial markets and institutions in India continue to function normally,” the RBI said in a statement. The central bank’s forex reserves currently stand at $487.2 billion.The RBI said that it will conduct six-month US dollar sell-buy swaps to provide dollar liquidity to the foreign exchange market, with the first such swap for $2 billion to be held on March 16. The swap amounts to lending dollars to banks as there is a simultaneous contract to buy them back.According to DBS Bank country treasurer Ashish Vaidya , there is a global shortage of dollars. “Globally, corporates are stocking up on cash by selling treasuries. Given the market conditions, they are engaging in deleveraging, which is resulting in a shortage of dollars,” he said. “The sell-buy swaps will generate dollar liquidity and ensure that the rupee does not weaken sharply.”However, dealers do expect the rupee to come under pressure. “Unlike the previous swaps, this time the RBI will be selling dollars and simultaneously purchasing at the end of the swap period. With sufficient FX reserves to meet any contingency, such a move would enhance dollar liquidity in the FX market,” said IFA Global founder Abhishek Goenka. “This will calm down the pressure on the rupee to a certain extent. At the end of the swap, as the dollar will be bought back, the RBI will be at a comfortable position. This will encourage the central bank to do more sell-buy swaps until the rupee volatility is contained,” he added.“The swaps will result in a reduction of rupee liquidity. But the RBI is likely to offset that by conducting long-term repo operations (LTROs). In fact, the RBI could consider doing repo below its benchmark rates if it wants to bring down interest rates before the MPC,” said Vaidya.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74602808,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-73728,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/with-rupee-breaching-74-rbi-offers-for-desi-currency/articleshow/74602809.cms

“As per the health authorities, all incoming travellers, including Indians, arriving or having visited China, Italy, Iran, Republic of Korea, France, Spain and Germany after February 15 shall be quarantined for a minimum period of 14 days,” the advisory stated.

Mhaisekar said the administration has informed the airport authorities about the decision and sought details about the flyers. In case of any Covid-19 symptom, the flyer will be admitted to the Naidu Hospital for treatment.

“A Spice Jet flight will reach Pune at 4.30am on Friday. All travel details about the people on board have been sought. Each flier has been told to fill a self-declaration form. The forms will be checked and the fliers with recent history of travel to the seven countries will have to go for institutional quarantine,” he added.

Pune airport director Kuldeep Singh, “One copy of the self-declaration form is given to the airport health officer and the other to the immigration officer. Forms of the passengers are closely scrutinized, in addition to the screening of each passenger and those with a travel history to the restricted countries. People with Covid-19 symptoms are sent to the Naidu Hospital. Since March 5, we have screened around 1,600 passengers and nine of them have been sent to Naidu Hospital.”

Once a traveller is quarantined, his or her relative will be requested not to meet the person. Mhaisekar said, “The purpose of institutional quarantine is to ensure isolation of a person if there are any Covid-19 symptoms within the 14-day period.”

Mhaisekar said arrangements for the institutional quarantine were being made at centres coming up within the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) limits in coordination with the civic authorities.

Officials said over 400 beds were already in place at over 21 facilities for institutional quarantine and the number would increase in accordance with the requirement.

Till now, Pune district has reported nine Coronavirus positive cases. The latest Covid-19 positive person was a man who had returned to the cty from the US on March 1. He tested Coronavirus positive on Wednesday.

PATNA: City schools have issued guidelines for their students to follow regarding novel coronavirus in the country. They have limited the number of gatherings, including the morning assembly, in order to maintain the prescribed one-metre distance between students.

The schools are conducting awareness drives in which children are being repeatedly instructed to maintain distance, wash hands frequently with soap and water, use sanitizers, keep handkerchief over mouth while coughing and sneezing among other instructions issued by the government of India.

Several private schools are closed as the final examinations are over for up to Class IX. As board examinations are going on in CBSE and CISCE affiliated schools, they have ensured one-metre space between children’s desks.

Rajiv Ranjan Sinha, principal of Baldwin Academy, said, “In each classroom, only 24 students are allowed and one teacher during the Class X and XII board examination. We are taking all precautionary measures. Students are allowed to wash hands during the exam and there is also one-metre gap between each desk.”

Data on individuals aged 18 years and below suggest that there is a relatively low attack rate in this age group (2.4% of all reported cases), according to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The BEPC state project director, Sanjay Kumar Singh, has instructed district education officers and district programme officers to share information pamphlet of Covid-19, furnished by the Centre, which would come handy to teachers, to sensitise the students.

It is also in talks with paramedics to adopt thermal screening at the entrance in a week to demonstrate that it is safe inside.Several other malls have started offering hand sanitizers at entrances and introduced regular deep cleaning of surfaces like elevator buttons, escalator rails and door handles.Speaking to TOI, Forum Mall operations head Ujjal said masks had been handed out to ground staffers to ensure health safety. “We have around 35 staffers who are in constant touch with several hundred people daily. Masks will ensure their protection as they go about making the mall safe for the patrons,” he said“We will check temperatures of staffers and visitors and request those who have fever to visit a doctor,” he explained.The mall management has also kept a tissue box and hand sanitizer at the entrance for use by customers. It has also introduced a mobile sanitizer and tissue carrier, equipping staff with a pouch belts to dispense them to customers. In addition, it has begun disinfecting the frequent touch-points in the facility.The management at the other malls — South City, Quest, Acropolis and City Centre — have also intensified cleaning operations, but have opted against use of masks or thermal screening, pointing out that it could actually scare customers instead of reassuring them. “We are taking precautions quietly. Announcing it may alarm customers,” said Manmohan Bagri of South City Mall, where toilets are being cleaned more rigorously and more often. The mall is also using its LED screens to make people aware on ways to stay safe from the virus.At Quest, the floor and all touch-points are being mopped every four hours. But here, too, the mall is against any demonstrable action that triggers panic among customers. “Footfall has dipped by 10% in the past 10 days. For now, we can keep the environment clean and make the place safe for customers,” said mall in charge Sanjeev Mehra.With the Maharashtra government advising people not to go to malls, most mall officials here are on edge.

PATNA: Three precious idols of Hindu deities—Lord Rama, Sita and Lakshman—- were stolen from a temple in Purnia district, police said on Thursday.

The incident came to light on Thursday morning when the priest of the temple woke up from sleep. Some local residents rushed to the spot after an alarm raised by the priest Murari Baba. Police said the idols made of astadhatu were stolen from a temple located near Rajni Chowk under Kazanchi Hat police station in the district headquarters town. The value of the stolen idols was estimated to be around Rs 2 crore in the international market.

Police have detained the priest on the statement of some local residents, who alleged that the theft was committed despite the presence of Murari Baba on the temple premises. “We are investigating the role of the priest in the incident,” the SP told reporters after visiting the spot.

Anil Choudhary, a local resident, told police that the CCTV installed in the temple was tampered with by the thieves. Earlier, a similar incident was reported from Ramnagar about five years ago. “A well-knit gang of smugglers involved in theft of precious idols and antiques is operating in the district,” a senior police officer said.

PATNA: State environment, forests and climate change department is working on a plan to increase the number of rhinos at Valmiki Tiger Reserve (VTR) in West Champaran district, the state’s lone tiger reserve.

A senior forest department official said from a sizeable population of rhinos at VTR till around a few years ago, the number has now come down to just one.

Forest department principal secretary Dipak Kumar Singh said a security assessment committee comprising experts is working on selection of habitat for bringing rhinos to VTR. “After the security assessment, the department will send a formal proposal to National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). If the proposal is approved by NTCA, rhinos from Kaziranga in Assam and Patna zoo will be accommodated in VTR. The rhinos will be left in the wild inside the reserve forest area,” Singh said.

There are presently 11 rhinos, including six male and five female, at Patna zoo. Incidentally, Patna zoo has the second highest number of rhino population in the world. According to sources, Patna zoo had sent rhinos to Delhi, Kanpur, Ranchi and Hyderabad zoos and one to the US as well in the past.

Also, a breeding facility for one-horned rhinos spread over an area of 2.5 acres between the new lake and jungle trail area at the zoo is also being finalized. The foundation stone for the centre was laid in 2017.

The facilities at the rhino breeding centre include a night house, separate shaded and open area. It would also have a lake and grassland to provide natural habitat for rhinos and help in mating.

Though Indian carriers have not yet announced when they, too, will suspend flights to Dhaka, sources in these carriers said it was inevitable after India announced the decision to shut its doors to foreign nationals from midnight on Friday. The lockdown is till April 15, 2020. Sri Lankan Airlines is also likely to stop flying to Kolkata from this weekend.“All four Bangladeshi airlines operating to Kolkata — Biman Bangladesh, Regent Airways, US-Bangla Airlines and Novo Air — have said that they will suspend scheduled fights to Kolkata from Saturday. Though they may operate a few chartered flights to evacuate Bangladeshi citizens thereafter, there are no plans to resume full-fledged operations before April 15, 2020,” a source at Kolkata airport told TOI.On Thursday, Biman Bangladesh cancelled flight BG 0096 that was to depart from Kolkata at 9pm.Indian carriers Air India, IndiGo Airlines and SpiceJet, too, are evaluating the scenario and are expected to announce flight suspension dates shortly. While there will be enough Bangladeshi passengers on Dhaka-bound flights, the airlines aren’t sure if they will get even a dozen passengers on return flights after India announced the cancellation of all visas.Bangladeshis comprise more than a quarter of international arrivals at Kolkata airport. While 60% of them are patients and their family members, the rest comprise businessmen and holidayers in equal measure. Samshad Alam, who runs a travel agency on Marquis Street, a Bangladeshi enclave in Kolkata, said he has been inundated with requests for flight and bus tickets to Dhaka before services shut down.Over the next couple of days, other international carriers, including Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, Thai Airways, AirAsia, Singapore Airlines and Sri Lankan Airlines are expected to reduce frequency of services to Kolkata and other cities in India and, thereafter, stop altogether. An airport official said skeletal services to Bangkok and Dubai are likely to remain Kolkata’s tenuous link with the outside world when India isolates itself in a bid to stop the spread of Covid-19.“It will take time for airlines to come to terms with the situation and announce a response. The operations team in each airline is at the desk, working on a tentative date when demand will taper. Once traffic load reduces below the threshold, the flights will be suspended,” said an official of a private carrier.For the travel trade fraternity, the lockdown move after similar advisories were issued by China, South Korea, Italy, Kuwait, Qatar and Bhutan has turned the situation worse. On Thursday, travel agents in the city received incessant calls, many of them to cancel future travel plans. There were also several calls from those already on trips who required urgent clarification after the lockdown order.“From Indians who are abroad to Indians who live abroad and are now here, as well as foreigners in India, everyone is confused about what to do. There are those who want to return and want to know if they will be quarantined when they reach and there are those who have left for abroad and are worried if they can be quarantined before they reach their destination.

PALANPUR: Sabarkantha police have cracked the double murder of cousin sisters from Bihar whose bodies were found from different places in the district last month.

The sisters - one 16-year-old and another 17 - were brutally murdered by two men - Vikas Kumar (24) and Munna Kumar (20) who were working as machine operators in a local mining company. The younger one’s body, which was half-eaten by dogs, was found near Dedrota village on February 25, while her cousin’s body was found from a check dam near Gambhoi village on February 20.

The victims as well as the accused were from Nautan, an interior village of Bihar’s East Champaran district. Five months ago, Vikas and Munna had forced the girls to elope with them with a promise of better lifestyle and money. They were working with the mining company for the past two years

“The girls were living with the accused in a farm along with some other families. Vikas and Munna suspected that the girls had some illicit relationship with some local boys. This is why they murdered both of them,” said Chaitanya Mandlik, superintendent of police, Sabarkantha.

On February 15, the duo told the younger one that they wanted her to meet a relative in Vadodara. They boarded a rickshaw but got down at an isolated bauxite mining site near Dedrota. They strangulated the girl and stuffed her body inside a pipe. They even placed stones on both sides so that no one would notice the body. “However, the body was removed by some stray dogs and it was half eaten when recovered on February 25,” Mandlik said.

When they returned home after killing her, the girl’s elder sister started making inquiries about her. On February 19, the duo took her to a mining site near Gambhoi on February 19 on the pretext of meeting her sister. After having meals there, they strangulated her also and dumped her body in the check dam after tying it with a stone so that it could not come afloat, Mandlik said, adding that the body was recovered the next day.

In the meantime, the girls’ parents approached the local panchayat which decided to summon both men to the village. This scared the duo even more, which was another reason for murdering the girls.

BHUBANESWAR: Already under fire over the uncertainty of the Puri Jagannath Temple’s Rs 545 crore in Yes Bank accounts, the government on Thursday came in for further criticism with opposition parties claiming that several thousand crores had been parked in the crisis-hit bank.

During an argument in the assembly over the deposit of temple funds in the bank, senior BJP leader Bishnu Charan Sethi alleged that the state-owned Odisha Mining Corporation (OMC) has also deposited Rs 650 crore in Yes Bank. The OMC is yet to react on the allegations.

Similarly, Congress legislature party leader Narasingha Mishra alleged that the government’s Rs 3,000 crore is also stuck in Yes Bank and demanded a clarification from chief minister Naveen Patnaik on the issue.

The opposition members also wanted the finance minister to clarify on the department-wise deposit of government fund in Yes Bank and other private banks. Both BJP and Congress leaders also urged the speaker to form an assembly panel to probe as to how Jagannath Temple funds was deposited in Yes Bank.

Participating in the debate, opposition chief whip and BJP leader Mohan Majhi also criticized the government for including Yes Bank in the list of empanelled banks of the state government to handle transactions of PSUs and autonomous bodies.

The opposition chief whip also criticised former Shree Jagannath Temple Administrator (SJTA) P K Mohapatra (during whose tenure the money was deposited in Yes Bank) and temple managing committee member and chartered accountant Bijay Kumar Sahoo, who enjoyed Europe trip sponsored by the bank for depositing the temple funds.

Responding to allegations, Mohapatra said, “Since the matter is being debated in the assembly, I don’t want to comment on it. I would only like to clarify that I have not travelled to Europe in the last four years.”

Stating that allegations against him are false, Sahoo said he had not travelled abroad with Mohapatra in 2019 as is being alleged.

Even if they have not toured countries like China, Italy, France, South Korea, Iran, France, Spain and Germany, their return to India and quarantine issues are making them anxious.On March 1, the unit of SVF’s ‘Kakababur Protyaborton’ — starring Prosenjit Chatterjee , Aryann and Anirban Chakraborty and directed by Srijit Mukherji — left for South Africa. Shooting began on March 5 in places like Bela-Bela in the Limpopo province and the Lion & Safari Park in the Gauteng province, but by March 11, the Twitter account of WHO’s Africa region showed that the number of coronavirus cases in South Africa was up to seven. Gauteng, incidentally, is one of the provinces that has recorded a coronavirus case.On being asked if the recent travel advisory has impacted the schedule, SVF co-founder and director Mahendra Soni said, “Things are on track now.

78,['13/03/2020'],Bihar: Heavy vehicle ban on J P Setu hits truckers,"Several complaints regarding the ban on J P Setu have been received

PATNA: With the ban on movement of heavy vehicles on J P Setu , trucks and tractors have no other option but to use Veer Kunwar Singh bridge via Sahar bridge on Sone river in Bhojpur district to reach Hajipur.

Bihar Truck Owners’ Association (BTOA) president Bhanu Shekhar Prasad Singh said the ban has just increased the distance manifold. “Earlier, the trucks used to travel 10km for reaching Hajipur. However, after the ban, they are covering a distance of 150km from Patna via Arwal and Ara to reach Hajipur. Trucks that hardly took few hours to reach north Bihar are now taking seven to 10 days,” he said.

Singh added that the ban has severely hit transport of sand, stone aggregates and other materials. “Movement of heavy vehicles is already not allowed on Koilwar bridge, Mahatma Gandhi Setu and Rajendra Setu. As a result, prices of sand, stone aggregates and other construction materials have surged,” he said.

Singh said the association has urged the government to allow movement of all types of heavy vehicles on J P Setu and six-wheeled vehicles on Gandhi Setu.

Divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said the decision to ban movement of heavy vehicles on J P Setu was taken a fortnight ago after general manager of East Central Railway (ECR), Hajipur division, suggested the state government to take precautionary measures for the safety of the bridge between Digha and Pahleja in Sonepur.

“The ban is temporary and we will find a permanent solution soon. A committee comprising engineers of road construction department has been formed to examine the strength of the bridge. After this, a meeting will be held with the ECR and RCD engineers for a final decision,” Agarwal, who is also the managing director of Bihar Road Construction Department Limited (BSRDCL), said.

Meanwhile, a senior RCD engineer said the department has received several complaints from transporters regarding the ban on J P Setu. “The bridge was constructed to carry all kinds of heavy vehicles. It comes under the A1 class, which has the highest loading capacity,” he said.

80,['13/03/2020'],"Work boycott: General-OBC employees strike intensifies, take out torch procession","Dehradun: In no mood to relent from their stand, thousands of members of the Uttarakhand General-OBC employees ’ association continued with their indefinite work boycott on Thursday, seeking removal of a provision which provides for SC/ST quota promotions in government jobs.

The protesters, who have been on work boycott since March 2, also took out a mashaal (fire-torch) procession from Parade Ground to the state secretariat.

A letter written by chief secretary Utpal Kumar Singh on Wednesday asking them to return to work citing coronavirus threat and the need to be adequately prepared failed to make any impact on the protesters, who claimed, “The protest will only be called off after a government order is issued on our demand.”

The members of diploma pharmacists association, Uttarakhand nurses services association, X-ray technicians, lab technicians and other Class IV staff of various hospitals also extended their support to the protest by boycotting work for two hours on Thursday.

All these organisations claimed that they would go on a complete work boycott from March 16.

“Our demand or rather request is simple: The state government needs to follow the Supreme Court order on reservation in promotion,” president of Uttarakhand General-OBC employees’ association Deepak Joshi told TOI.

He said the protest would continue until the government heeds to their request.

The association wants the government to comply with the apex court’s February 7 order which said the states are not bound to provide reservation in promotions and reservation is not a fundamental right.

The SC judgment came in response to a special leave petition filed by the Uttarakhand government seeking stay on the state high court order which asked the government to fill up government posts by providing reservation in promotion.

Meanwhile, the protesters also visited the government departments on Thursday and ensured that the employees remain off work. A few instances were reported where some employees, who were found working, were reportedly harassed and forced to leave the office premises and join the protest.

The General-OBC employees’ association furthersaid its members would visit locations near their homes to spread a “general awareness campaign” on March 14 and 15. The association said a motorcycle rally would be taken out in all districts on March 15 as well.

Further, all general and OBC employees have also been directed by the association to take their family members and relatives to the protest site on March 17.

“Our aim is not to cause disturbance, but we have no choice but to hold these protests to make our voices heard,” Virendra Gosain, the general secretary of the association said.

Balaram met chief minister and YSRC supremo YS Jaganmohan Reddy at the latter’s residence on Wednesday.

Although, Balaram has not officially joined YSRC, keeping in view of Jaganmohan Reddy’s policy of not admitting legislators from other parties without them resigning their posts, Balaram’s son Venkatesh, however has joined YSRC.

Energy minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy, TDP rebel legislator Vallabhaneni Vamsi of Gannavaram constituency escorted Balaram and his followers to the chief minister. Venkatesh said they have decided to join the YSRC after seeing the overwhelming mandate of people for the chief minister’s welfare activities. He said the chief minister’s vision to equally develop all regions has also been well- received by the people and they would work to strengthen YSRC in the district.

Balaram’s resignation is a big jolt to the TDP, particularly with the local body elections coming up.

The former chief minister wrote a letter to the State Election Commission justifying his demand and listing the number of incidents of violence reported across the state.

Naidu claimed YSRC leaders had resorted to violence at several places to prevent others from filing nominations. He wrote that the ruling party’s workers had at several places physically assaulted opposition candidates and snatched their nomination papers. He also alleged that the police were hand-in-glove with ruling party leaders.

The TDP chief further said that in some places, officials were not available to issue nativity certificate for candidates to file nominations.

Naidu wrote that violent incidents were reported at 76 places across the state ahead of mandal parishad and zilla parishad elections. The local police responded only to complaints filed by the ruling party and turned a blind eye to complaints from opposition parties, he alleged.

Violence was reported in Pulivendula, Punganuru, Macherla, Mantralayam and other places in the state. He sent a consolidated statement of incidence of violence reported from across the state and requested the State Election Commission to take necessary action against ruling party workers.

He also demanded that action be taken against police personnel who aided ruling party leaders in several places and prevented opposition party candidates from filing nominations. He requested the State Election Commission to issue fresh notification in all the places including Pulivendula and Macharla where incidents of serious violence were reported.

83,['13/03/2020'],Serial killer who had jumped parole a year ago nabbed,"Rajkot: A serial killer who was absconding for the past one year after jumping parole was nabbed from 80 ft Road in Rajkot on Thursday.

Police said the convict Nilay Mehta (40) was involved in as many as six murders and sentenced to life imprisonment in two cases.

On February 22 last year, Mehta was released on parole from Rajkot Central Jail and went absconding. After jumping the parole, Mehta had gone to Ahmedabad where he had committed a loot in Amraiwadi area, after which he had fled to Uttar Pradesh, where he worked as a labourer in Kumbh Mela in Allahabad. From Allahabad, Mehta had gone to Lucknow, and from there he had returned to Rajkot.

“The moment we learnt about Mehta’s presence in Rajkot, we activated our informers, found out about his whereabouts on 80-Feet Road and nabbed him,” said Rajkot police commissioner Manoj Agarwal.

“We suspect that Mehta had returned to Rajkot to commit some big crime. It is suspected that Mehta had taken ‘supari’ (contract) to kill someone for which he had come to the city,” said Agarwal.

Agrawal said that the police would produce Mehta before the chief judicial magistrate court in Rajkot to seek his remand. “During his remand, we intend to find out his motive to visit Rajkot,” he added.

Apart from the murders, Mehta also faces charges ranging from robberies, thefts to physical assault.

HID TWO BLADES UNDER CHEEKS

Like the character of ‘Perpendicular’ from the famous Bollywood crime caper ‘Gangs of Wasseypur II’, Mehta would keep two pieces of one blade in his mouth — one each under both his cheeks. He would take out the piece of the blade and cut the throat of his victim. However, most of the murders he had committed with knives. After his arrest, the police found the pieces of blade from his mouth. While his first murder was out of personal enmity, the other five murders were committed for loot. Surprisingly, he never suffered any injury due to the blades in the mouth.

85,['13/03/2020'],"With Rs breaching 74, RBI offers $ for desi currency","Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) said that it has enough forex reserves and would supply banks dollars for six months through sell-buy swaps to ensure supply at a time of turmoil in global markets. The announcement came as the rupee hit a lifetime low of 74.48 in intra-day trades in the interbank market, in line with the rout in equity markets.With state-owned banks selling dollars, the rupee recovered to close at 74.22, which was 58 paise lower than Wednesday. One positive news was the improvement in the country’s current account deficit (CAD), which narrowed sharply to $1.4 billion, or 0.2% of the GDP, for the December 2019 quarter as against 2.7% a year ago and 0.9% in the preceding quarter. However, with equity markets suffering their worst loss over fears of the coronavirus pandemic triggering a recession, overall sentiment was negative.“The RBI is closely and continuously monitoring the rapidly evolving global situation and spillovers. It stands ready to take all necessary measures to ensure that the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Indian economy are mitigated, and financial markets and institutions in India continue to function normally,” the RBI said in a statement. The central bank’s forex reserves currently stand at $487.2 billion.The RBI said that it will conduct six-month US dollar sell-buy swaps to provide dollar liquidity to the foreign exchange market, with the first such swap for $2 billion to be held on March 16. The swap amounts to lending dollars to banks as there is a simultaneous contract to buy them back.According to DBS Bank country treasurer Ashish Vaidya , there is a global shortage of dollars. “Globally, corporates are stocking up on cash by selling treasuries. Given the market conditions, they are engaging in deleveraging, which is resulting in a shortage of dollars,” he said. “The sell-buy swaps will generate dollar liquidity and ensure that the rupee does not weaken sharply.”However, dealers do expect the rupee to come under pressure. “Unlike the previous swaps, this time the RBI will be selling dollars and simultaneously purchasing at the end of the swap period. With sufficient FX reserves to meet any contingency, such a move would enhance dollar liquidity in the FX market,” said IFA Global founder Abhishek Goenka. “This will calm down the pressure on the rupee to a certain extent. At the end of the swap, as the dollar will be bought back, the RBI will be at a comfortable position. This will encourage the central bank to do more sell-buy swaps until the rupee volatility is contained,” he added.“The swaps will result in a reduction of rupee liquidity. But the RBI is likely to offset that by conducting long-term repo operations (LTROs). In fact, the RBI could consider doing repo below its benchmark rates if it wants to bring down interest rates before the MPC,” said Vaidya.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74602800,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-73728,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/with-rs-breaching-74-rbi-offers-for-desi-currency/articleshow/74602801.cms

PATNA: State agriculture minister Prem Kumar on Thursday appealed to farmers of 11 districts who suffered crop damage due to rain, storm and hailstorm last month to register themselves online for availing agriculture input subsidy as compensation that the government had announced for them. The last date for the online registration is March 23.

Any farmer who has suffered crop damage but not registered online while making the claim will not be eligible for the agriculture input subsidy benefit, the minister said.

The 11 districts which witnessed rain or hailstorm in February and also suffered consequent crop damage are Aurangabad, Bhagalpur , Buxar, Gaya, Jehanabad , Kaimur , Muzaffarpur, Patna , East Champaran, Samastipur and Vaishali, the minister said, adding an area assessment of crop damage was made at the local level by the district administrations concerned.

The minister said the farmers of the districts and blocks concerned whose standing rabi crops were damaged should get themselves registered online on either of the two portals of the agriculture department – www.krishi.bih.nic.in and dbtagriculture.bihar.gov.in.

The agriculture input subsidy will be transferred into the bank accounts of the farmers through the direct benefit transfer (DBT) method. Their claims will be cleared after proper verification.

Farmers whose crops on the non-irrigated or rain-fed plots of land were damaged will get Rs 6,500 per hectare of land, while the compensation is Rs 13,500 per hectare of irrigated land. The compensation paid would be for the maximum 2 hectares of land, the minister said.

PATNA: With the threat of Covid-19 looming large over the state, some miscreants are now using surgical masks to conceal their identity during the course of crime.

This is exactly what happened at a cake shop near the Mithapur bus stand under the Jakkanpur police station area in Patna late on Wednesday evening. Unsuspecting criminals wearing face masks entered the shop around 8pm, looted over Rs 15,000 after holding the staff and the owner captive at gunpoint and decamped with the cash on their motorbike.

Both the criminals — Sanu Kumar (21) and Sagar Kumar (22) — were wearing face masks to conceal their identity and hoodwink police. While Sanu barged into the shop posing as a bona fide customer, Sagar stood guard outside to keep a watch on the passers-by. Surprisingly, the Jakkanpur police station is just a stone’s throw from the site of occurrence, but police have no inkling of the incident.

City SP (East) Jitendra Kumar said on Thursday that both the criminals were later arrested with the help of the local people and the looted amount was recovered from their possession. While Sanu, a resident of Postal Park, has criminal antecedent and was earlier arrested in connection with a case lodged with the Kotwali police station, Sagar’s antecedents are being verified.

The City SP said, “The face masks as well as caps, which the robbers were wearing at the time of the incident, were seized. Police also recovered a ‘desi katta’ (countrymade weapon) and a motorbike used in the crime. The novel modus operandi of the robbers was captured in the CCTV camera installed in the shop.”

The SHO of Jakkanpur police station, Mukesh Kumar Verma, said a complaint was lodged against the criminals on the statement of the shop owner, Arjun Kumar. “Since the culprits have already been arrested, the charge sheet against them will be submitted in the court at the earliest,” he added.

89,['13/03/2020'],NGO steps in to rebuild burnt shops in northeast Delhi,"Shopowners say with the aid, they can finally look forward to resuming their businesses

NEW DELHI: Owners of several shops on the Khajuri Khas main road that were gutted and damaged by violent mobs in February, have got a helping hand. Khalsa Aid, an international NGO, has started rebuilding the shops for the owners free of cost.

“We have started work in Khajuri Khas and our volunteers will soon start restoring the shops in other riot-affected areas as well,” said a member of the NGO.

Shopowners say with the aid provided, they can finally look forward to resuming their businesses.

Gyanendra Kumar’s shop in Khajuri Khas is the first shop that is being repaired by Khalsa Aid. Kumar had opened his shop barely six months ago, and had never imagined that his shop would be looted, vandalised and burnt down by a mob.

“I was standing outside my shop when I was heckled by a mob. My Muslim neighbours made a human chain to protect my shop, but in vain. I will always remember their gesture. But the rioters were extremely violent and had my neighbours not finally relented, they would have burnt all of them alive too,” Kumar recalled.

Karan Khanna, whose shop is adjacent to Kumar’s, suffered a similar fate. Within a month of inauguration, his shop was gutted. His e-rickshaw store was burnt down by a mob on February 25 despite his neighbours trying their best to protect the shop from being burnt.

“The Khalsa Aid community is taking care of the expenses for repair work. They have lessened our burden while we await compensation from Delhi government,” Khanna said.

“When the violence broke out, I was around my shop. I had never seen anything like that before. My neighbours were quick to call us into their homes so that they could hide us from the mob. We have suffered losses of more than Rs 50 lakh and don’t know how will we be able to pick up the pieces,” Khanna added.

Satpal Singh, who owned ‘Classic Paints’ on the same road, claimed his losses are estimated to be around Rs 1 crore. “The NGO will be restoring most of the structure and electrical fittings, and also painting the shop. This should help us, but we are still eagerly waiting for the Delhi government’s compensation. The amount may not be sufficient to compensate for the losses, but we need some money at this juncture,” said Singh.

Som Lal, whose mattress shop was being renovated by the NGO on the same road, claimed most of the mattresses kept at his shops were either stolen or burnt during the riots. “We could not recover even a single piece. We also don’t have any funds left and are solely relying on the goodness of the NGO and the compensation claim,” said Lal.

PATNA: The Lalu Prasad-led RJD sprung a surprise on Thursday by fielding Amrendra Dhari Singh, an entrepreneur hailing from Dulhin Bazar in rural Patna, for the upcoming biennial election for Rajya Sabha.

Amrendra, from bhumihar caste, is a political greenhorn even though RJD state president Jagdanand Singh told reporters at the party headquarters here that he is a social worker and has been associated with the party from a while.

His name was announced along with Lalu’s close aide Prem Chand Gupta, who is a sitting member of the Upper House. “Prem Chand Gupta and Amrendra Dhari Singh have been selected by RJD for Rajya Sabha nomination. Amrendra Dhari has been a social worker and an eminent personality. He is a well-educated and learned person, who we believe, will be able to aptly represent the party in the Upper House,” Jagdanand said.

A 50-year-old bachelor, Amrendra Dhari is in the business of fertilisers and real estate. RJD insiders claimed that he is the grandson of late Jangdhari Singh, who was a well-known Bhumihar landlord of his time.

Many RJD MLAs claimed they don’t know much about Amrendra Dhari. Muneshwar Chaudhary, an RJD MLA, who was a proposer in the nomination filing process at the legislative assembly, told reporters that he came after being called by the party.

“Big leaders of the party must be aware of him. Whatever will be decided by the top leaders of our party- Lalu Ji and Tejashwi Ji will be accepted by us and we will be the voter for that person,” Chaudhary said.

Several other MLAs also cited lack of knowledge about Amrendra Dhari and claimed that they were told over phone to come for the nomination process and they were adhering to the instructions.

Political observers claimed that RJD has taken another step towards wooing the forward castes ahead of the assembly elections by nominating Amrendra Dhari. The apparent bid to attract forward caste by RJD started with the appointment of Jagdanand Singh as the state unit president last year.

Jagdanand, too, claimed that selection of Amrendra dhari shows representation of all sections of society in RJD. “RJD follows the Sarv-Samaj (entire society) policy and we are ensuing that all section of the society is suitably represented. It will be seen in the legislative council as well as upcoming assembly election as well,” he said.

Tejashwi also told reporters that the candidature of Prem Chand Gupta— a Vaishya — and Amrendra, a Bhumihar, “is a befitting reply to those who accuse RJD of confining itself to Muslim- Yadav (MY) combine”.

PATNA: In view of the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak in the country, the Bihar Industries Association (BIA) has postponed the ‘Bihar Startup Conclave’, which was scheduled to be held on March 14 in the city. The next date will be finalized once the effect of the virus minimizes.

BIA officials claimed that it was necessary to cancel the event as Covid-19 had spread its tentacles all over. Association’s president Ram Lal Khetan told this newspaper on Thursday, “The main speakers of the event, which include leading investors, innovators and entrepreneurs, have expressed their inability to attend the event on March 14. Hence, we will probably organize the conclave next month.”

The event will provide a platform to budding entrepreneurs, students and innovators with new startup ideas. The BIA has received more than 100 plans for the conclave, which is based on the ‘Agri-tech’ theme. Most entries are from Hyderabad, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bhubaneswar, Delhi, Kerala and Chennai.

“During the last three years, the BIA has provided funds to more than 50 startup plans. This year, we are promoting the technologies in the agriculture sector, on which a major population of the country is dependent. At least 14 prominent speakers will throw light on different aspects of the topic,” Khetan said and added that panel discussions and chats would also be conducted as part of the daylong conclave.

The first three winners will get Rs 1 lakh, Rs 50,000 and Rs 25,000, respectively. The next three will receive consolation prizes of Rs 10,000 each.

KOZHIKODE: While almost every PSC notification for government jobs in the state invariably sees a huge rush of applicants, often numbering to tens of thousands, the largest-ever recruitment of teachers in Calicut University for 116 vacancies through an all-India notification has received just around 3,000 applications .

According to sources, the varsity has received around 2,500 applications for 63 assistant professor vacancies and around 500 applications for 29 associate professor and 24 professor vacancies combined. This has brought down the odds for applicants to land the jobs to 1:10 and less in many associate professor and professor posts.

While critics have said the decision by the varsity to notify the vacancies without specifying the reservation turns and concerns among applicants of the possibility of the selection process hitting legal hurdles have dissuaded many applicants, varsity officials said receiving 3,000 applications was a reasonably good response and attributed the absence of huge rush of applicants to the eligibility criteria for the posts as per UGC regulations on minimum qualifications for appointment of teachers 2018.

“While 55% marks at the master’s level along with NET pass is the minimum qualification for assistant professor appointment, PhD degree has become a sort of unofficial requirement with most applicants having doctorate degrees. Also, there are not many qualified people for professor and associate professor posts in universities in the state satisfying the UGC’s eligibility norms regarding published research works and total research score,” syndicate member K K Haneefa said.

Meanwhile, UDF-aligned syndicate member Rasheed Ahammed said the 3,000 applications received by varsity for 116 teaching posts were definitely short of expectations. “Apprehensions over the recruitment process being challenged in the court and concerns about political interference have dissuaded many people who are working in affiliated colleges and elsewhere to submit applications,” he said.

KORAPUT: Thousands of rail commuters , who reach Jeypore railway station in Koraput district daily to catch trains, and those who alight from trains are suffering due to lack of basic amenities.

Passengers are having a harrowing time due to non-availability of safe drinking water and lack of proper sheds and washrooms.

With summer round the corner, the passengers are livid over alleged inaction of railway authorities to provide safe drinking water.

There are 16 water posts in the platform but all are running dry.

“In sweltering weather conditions, we face difficulty to fetch a bottle of drinking water as we have to go near the station manager’s chamber, which is more than 200 metres away from entrance,” said Trinath Bhuiyan, a passenger on Thursday. Also, the passengers alleged that they face difficulty to stand under direct sun.

Only a small portion of the platform is covered with shed which is not sufficient at rush hours.

“The entire platform should be covered,” said Krishna Rao, another passenger.

The station neither has a dormitory nor a proper washroom, he added.

With at least 10 passenger trains passing through the station daily, there is high footfall at the station.

An official said the drinking water problem at the station will be sorted out in next two weeks as a new bore-well will be dug.

“Due to depleting groundwater table we are unable to get sufficient water from the lone bore-well. A new bore-well will be dug soon to meet the water requirement,” said John Kujru, station superintendent, Jeypore railway station.

According to the official, a proposal for setting up a dormitory, a new platform, additional sitting arrangements and extending the shed of the platform, among others, has been submitted to the higher authorities for clearance. In next few months, the infrastructure facilities of the railway station will be strengthened, he said.

CHENNAI: Greater Chennai Corporation has announced that 60% of the smart carts that it is purchasing for the Marina beach will be given to applicants who are existing street vendors, while the remaining will be kept open for others who may not be vendors there but intend to start a business on the beach.

Two types of applications with details of terms and conditions, vending fees, timings, monthly rent, maintenance charges, penalty amount and other details have been uploaded on the civic body’s website. Those intending to apply should fill up the application with supporting documents from April 3 to April 8. This is as per the Madras high court’s orders in the writ petition 16797 of 2015 filed by Fisherman Care.

The corporation had earlier informed the high court that only 900 shops would be permitted on the beach for which Rs 3,000 a year would be collected as licence fee per vendor. Carts will be purchased at a total cost of Rs 16.47 crore, the civic body told the court.

The division bench of Justice Vineet Kothari and Justice R Suresh Kumar had told the civic body that the number of shops permitted on the beach shall not exceed 900 and no other street vendor should be allowed except the duly allotted and licensed shops.

The corporation said the allotment of the second category of vendors was made to strike a balance between the existing street vendors and those who want to run a business in the future.

The applications would be scrutinised from April 10 to April 15 and finalised on April 18. The draw of lots will be decided after finalisation of the application, the corporation said.

The allotment of shops and issue certificate of vending will be done after finalisation of the draw of lots, the civic body said.

They said the facility would be established before the Kumbh Mela 2021 begins.They added that the facility would be built through the private-public partnership (PPP) model.“The concept is like solving two problems in one stroke. On the one hand, we will be able to get rid of the plastic used in Kumbh while on the other, it will also help generate fuel,” said Narendra Singh Bhandari, Haridwar municipal commissioner.Providing further details of the proposed project, the official said that the Haridwar municipal corporation will not be investing any money in the project, but will provide land to set up the plant with the capacity to process 10 tonnes of plastic waste.“The partnership will also yield income for us as we would get rent against the land. The existing agency engaged for garbage collection in the city can also be tasked for collecting and carrying the plastic waste to the plant,” the municipal commissioner added.Since there are very few players with expertise in such projects, the Haridwar municipal corporation did not receive an overwhelming response the last time when the bidding process was initiated. The officials are now hopeful to receive “a good response”.Calling the effort futuristic, Anoop Nautiyal, founder of Dehradun-based Social Development for Communities (SDC) Foundation which is involved in setting up plastic banks in the city, said, “The move is all the more critical as the Kumbh mela will witness one of the biggest religious congregations, which will certainly result in the generation of a huge amount of waste.

100,['13/03/2020'],"YSRC silent on ZP chief choices, but names cleared, say insiders","Amaravati: The YSRC leadership has almost cleared the names for ZP chairperson posts in Guntur, Prakasam and Nellore districts. The party leadership asked legislators to extend their support to candidates and see that they get elected in ZPTC elections. The party directed district ministers to take adequate care in getting ZP chairperson candidates elected without any trouble from within the party.

However, the official announcement about candidates will be made only after the declaration of local body election results. YSRC, which is hopeful of bagging most of the seats in ZPs, is readying candidates to take the top post to avoid last minute jostling. Sources said that the party had cleared the name of Dalit leader Kattera Heny Christina for the ZP chairperson’s post in Guntur. Christina was, in fact, recently nominated as chairperson of District Cooperative Marketing Society (DCMS). Christina lost the 2014 Assembly elections from Tadikonda constituency as party nominee and served as party constituency in-charge for five years when YSRC was in opposition. However, the party replaced her with Dr V Sridevi in the 2019 elections and promised Christina due recognition when the party comes to power. Initially, Christina was made DCMS chairperson as it was believed that the ZP chief’s post would fall under general quota. Although, the post was made women’s quota during the initial fixation, it was allocated to SC (woman) quota after the reduction of quotas to reserved categories to 50 percent. The change of reservation helped Christina back in the race for the top post. Sources said that YSRC elections coordination team comprising senior leaders reported to have asked Tenali legislator Annabathuni Sivakumar to field Christina from Kollipara mandal as ZPTC in his constituency and work for her victory.

Similarly, the party cleared the name of Buchepalli Venkayamma, legislator Sivaprasada Reddy’s mother for the ZP chairperson post in Prakasam district. She is contesting as Darsi ZPTC. After Sivaprasada Reddy expressed unwillingness to contest assembly elections due to his father and former MLA Subbareddy’s ill health and business issues, the party fielded Maddisetty Venugopal from Darsi constituency. Venugopal won the seat with the support of Buchepalli family which had a good following in the constituency.

As Sivaprasada Reddy had been loyal to Jagan since he floated the party a decade ago, the party decided to give the ZP post to their family. Venkayamma had served as mandal president in Chimakurthy in the past. Sources said that YSRC had cleared the name of Anam Arunamma, wife of senior leader Vijayakumar Reddy, for the ZP chairperson post. She is contesting as ZPTC from Nellore rural mandal.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday came out again in stout defence of Delhi Police, saying it had acted swiftly to bring the situation in the riot-hit northeast Delhi under control and asked the opposition to refrain from attacking the force.

During a debate in Rajya Sabha on Delhi riots , Shah rejected the opposition charge that police had failed to control the violence on the first day itself when it was confined to a limited area. “If you have to blame, you can attack me... I am a politician...I can take it but don’t attack police. They dealt with the situation rather swiftly, preventing the riot from spreading. In 36 hours, they brought everything under control,” he said.

When Aam Aadmi’Party’s Sanjay Singh tried to intervene to say that the riots went on for longer, the treasury benches shot back in protest and the home minister shared details of the time when the first information on the violence came on the afternoon of February 24 and the last information at 11.00 pm on February 25.

Sanjay Singh accused the home minister of doing nothing when Delhi kept burning for three days. “I want to ask what was the home minister doing. Such a minister has no right to remain in his post,” he said. Singh said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had sought imposition of curfew and deployment of the Army to deal with the riots, but the Centre did not act.

Shah said that at high level meeting on February 25 where the lieutenant governor, the CM and senior officials were present, Kejriwal made no such request. he said the Delhi CM was talking about the Army on February 27 when rioting had stopped. Shah took a dig at Kejriwal saying the CM may have suddenly started raising his voice as “so many things were found from his (AAP) councillor’s (Tahir Hussain) house and he had to be suspended”.

Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar asked, “Was the bomb factory discovered at Tahir's (suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain) house not instigation?”

Shah said hundreds of social media accounts were created just before February 24, the day the riots started, and large number of them were closed by the night of February 25. He said the investigating teams were tracing all such accounts and book those who spread hate.

The home minister also rejected conspiracy theories behind the transfer of Delhi High Court judge S Muralidhar who had ordered registering of FIRs against BJP functionaries and ministers for alleged hate speech, saying it was done on the recommendation of the SC collegium. “Why do you think only one judge can give justice and not any other?” he asked.

Five other persons from a different community were also arrested by the police for allegedly pelting stones on police and causing violence in Upper Kot and Babri Mandi area on February 23.

Confirming this, SP (crime) Arvind Kumar said that Varshney was arrested and remanded to judicial custody for 14 days.

Varshney was shifted to Etah prison on Thursday to maintain law and order in the city, said Kumar.

Five others identified as Faimuddin, Mustaqeem, Sabir, Imran and Anwar had also been remanded to judicial custody on Thursday, said the SP. He added that they were named, along with 23 others, in another FIR for indulging in stone pelting. He said that others will be arrested soon.

According to Tariq’s brother, Shariq, Tariq had received a gunshot wound in his stomach. He said that two others were also named in the FIR, but they have not been arrested so far.

Several BJP leaders, including the party’s MLAs Anil Parashar, Sanjeev Raja from Aligarh, reached the prison to meet Varshney, but they refused to speak to the media after meeting him and only said “government will look into the matter”.

109,['13/03/2020'],Man arrested for his role in murder of IB staffer during northeast Delhi riots,"Ankit Sharma’s body was recovered from the Chand Bagh drain on February 26

NEW DELHI: The Special Cell has formally arrested a man named Haseen Qureshi for allegedly being involved in the murder of intelligence official Ankit Sharma during the northeast Delhi riots . Police claimed his interrogation had, for the first time, shed light on what transpired at the Pulia in Chand Bagh where Sharma was brutally killed by a mob.

Qureshi, who was arrested by the southwestern range of the Special Cell on Thursday, has reportedly told the cops that he was present in the area with his friend Sameer. Around 2pm, he saw violence had broken out in the area and decided to join in. He told cops they mingled in the crowd and started throwing stones at people from the other community who had gathered on the other side of the Pulia.

In the meantime, Qureshi picked up a knife kept near the stall of a sweet shop and stood on the road near the residence of suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, a source said. Hussain, along with his brother Shah Alam, has been arrested on the charges of hatching a conspiracy that led to Sharma’s murder.

After walking around for some time, Qureshi saw that a group of 20-30 people had been dragging a person from the other side of the Pulia to this side, said the source. Qureshi claimed he didn’t know the man’s identity.

As he rushed towards the group, police claimed, he saw the mob brutally thrashing the man with sticks, stones and other objects and stabbed the person three times and also kicked him. He apparently told the cops that as the man stopped responding after a few minutes, they picked up his body and threw it in the drain.

The next day — when Sharma’s body was recovered from the Chand Bagh drain — Qureshi identified the man from the photograph being shown on the television and went underground.

He was nabbed by a Special Cell team led by DCP Sanjeev Yadav, who had formed a team comprising of ACP Sanjay Dutt and inspectors Atul Tyagi and Dalip Kumar to work on technical intelligence. By deploying sources on the ground to develop the electronic leads, the team zeroed in on Qureshi, whose location was found to be around the spot where Sharma was killed.

The Special Cell is hoping to identify other killers with the help of Qureshi, who has been remanded in police custody.

113,['13/03/2020'],Meet on prospects of cargo flight to NE,"Nashik: A team of officials from SpiceJet, a private airline, will be coming to Nashik on March 16 to explore the possibilities of starting cargo flights to transport vegetables and fruits to the Northeast (NE) states under the Krishi Uddan scheme.

A meeting will be held on Monday between SpiceJet officials, Halcon — which is a joint venture between Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) and Container Corporation of India (Concor) — and farmers, in Ozar near the city.

“SpiceJet is keen on starting a dedicated freighter to transport vegetables and fruits from Nashik to the NE. Accordingly, the team of officials from SpiceJet will hold talks with Halcon and farmers,” said an official from Halcon.

“Consignments of grapes are sent to Guwahati by road, which takes around five days to reach the destination. Transporting grapes by air will save time and the cost. There are chances of sending pomegranates and other vegetables to NE states through a dedicated freighter,” said Halcon official.

At present, Halcon exports 4,500 tonne of fresh vegetables and fruits annually to London, Dubai and other international markets via Mumbai airport.

Vegetables like okra, drumstick, luffa, flat beans, chilli and others are exported by air directly from Nashik airport to Dubai. Fresh fruits like pomegranate, guava and chiku are also exported via Mumbai airport.

Farmers will get more business if they get new markets like NE states to transport vegetables, said an official from Halcon.

During the three months of the rainy season beginning from June, there has been a huge demand for sheep and goat in Sharjah. Farmers and exporters from Nashik and other parts of North Maharashtra have been exporting goats and sheep for the past few years.

Last year, SpiceJet had started its air cargo service to Sharajah during three months of the rainy season.

SpiceJet will also get this business if it starts air cargo service from Nashik, added the official.

Following the outbreak of Covid-19, Shri Mangesh temple at Mangeshi Ponda had requested the state health department to install thermal screening machinery at the entrance.

But the health services directorate has said there is no need for such measures at every place.

“We have been screening passengers from foreign countries at the airport and if any person is found with an infection, or similar symptoms, we shift them to Goa Medical College and Hospital (GMC) for medical aid,” Dr Utkarsh Betodkar, nodal officer for Covid-19 at the DHS said.

“The incubation period for coronavirus is 14 days but we either hotel quarantine or house quarantine the suspected infected person for at least 15 days to refrain him from moving out into public places,” he added.

Shri Mangesh temple secretary Sudin Ambe said they have already kept hand wash available for visitors and ascertained that the temple staff, including the priest, who have direct access to visitors wear masks.

118,['13/03/2020'],Covid-19: Halt in foreign arrivals to hit Goa where it hurts,"Cancellation of visas is being perceived as the final nail in the coffin.

PANAJI: International tourist flow has come to a grinding halt after India suspended all tourist visas and e-visas on Wednesday evening.

The decision has hastened the charter seasons which normally ends by the first week of May. Though the news came as a relief to many, tour operators, hoteliers and taxi drivers had a tough time coming to terms with reality on Thursday.

Abida Kumar, vice-president at Minar Travels (India) Pvt Ltd, said that since the news broke out, she attended to endless calls from hotels and agents. Foreign travellers in Goa have called her to find out if their stay would be shortened.

“It is a terrible scenario. The season has ended. For us, the last chartered flight arrives from Russia on Friday morning,” she said. Travellers who are already in the state, she said, will return as per their scheduled departure.

Amar Dhumatkar, president of the Goa chapter at Caper Travel India Pvt Ltd, said that since the chartered flight slated for Friday morning is landing as per schedule, they assume tourists will not shorten their stay. “We haven’t received anything in black and white. Foreign operators are still locked in discussion,” he said.

Flights will come empty and leave with passengers. “It entails a huge cost to operators,” he added.

Savio Messias, president of Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG), said it will not be easy to quantify the losses at this stage, but the impact will be “huge”.

The cancellation of visas is being perceived as the final nail in the coffin by some with hotels being hit the worst. Francisco de Braganca, a hotelier, said, “The good thing is that the major part of the season is nearly over. We need to concentrate on domestic tourists,” he said. Messias said domestic tourists are likely to benefit from the drop in room tariffs and travel cost.

John Lobo, secretary of the Goa Shack Owners’ Welfare Society said shacks that depend on foreign footfalls will close early. “In Baga and some parts of Calangute, shacks will not shut shop early. Travellers from neighbouring states will visit,” he said. President Cruz Cardozo is not as optimistic. “We in South Goa will wait a week before taking a call. I don’t think people will take the risk of travelling, ” he said.

HYDERABAD: A child rights organisation on Thursday lodged a complaint with Mahbubnagar superintendent of police after a photograph of a minor boy chained inside a police station went viral.

Mahbubnagar police said the photo was from the II Town police station after a 14-year-old boy was nabbed for allegedly stealing mobile phones.

The boy was nabbed on Wednesday by police and he was taken to the II Town police station, where the local police reportedly chained him to immobilise him. However, a photograph was taken by an unknown person, who shared it on social media.

Deputy superintendent of police (Mahbubnagar sub-division) B Bhaskar said that after the photograph went viral, an inquiry was ordered into what led to the minor being chained.

The warden of the residential school, where the boy studies, was called by police. Later, he was produced before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), which later handed over him to the warden in view of the forthcoming examination season.

On Thursday, child rights NGO Balala Hakkula Sangam lodged a complaint with the director-general of police and Mahbubnagar SP Rema Rajeshwari. When the SP was contacted over phone, she was unavailable.

So, all international passengers from these seven countries who came after February 15 would be put on compulsory screening.When asked why the US has been left out, divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar told TOI the list of seven nations has been finalized by a group of ministers (GoMs) led by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, and local authorities cannot go beyond the guidelines. “They (Central government) are not going by a fixed set of norms. The guidelines may be modified from time to time,” he said.Kumar along with DDHS Sanjay Jaiswal, district collector Ravindra Thakare , municipal commissioner Tukaram Munde, and deans of both government hospitals, Sajal Mitra and Ajay Keoliya, held a press briefing after panic gripped the city in the wake of its first positive case.They emphasized on the need for ‘home isolation’ while announcing dedicated helplines to prevent assembly of crowds at outpatient departments (OPDs) beside reviewing screening measures to fight the pandemic.Kumar said he received instructions from the health secretary to now compulsorily screen all passengers who have come from France, Germany, Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain and China since February 15.Amid a series of meetings with different stakeholders, the district administration has convened another meet with all overseas tour operators to identify such travellers and quarantine them for 14 days.So far, 604 travellers have been screened at Nagpur International Airport while 59 suspected cases belonging to Nagpur, Wardha, and Chandrapur had to be quarantined. The revised screening will cover passengers who came in through all transport channels.“Some 40 suspected cases were from Nagpur, 15 from Wardha and two from Chandrapur. Of these, 45 were kept under observation and reported free of the virus. Rest of the 15 are still quarantined,” said Kumar.From Friday, compulsory screening of overseas passengers is likely to begin in the city.Kumar said adequate measures are in place to deal with the situation. “Besides isolation wards at GMCH and IGGMCH, we would start a quarantine facility at MLA Hostel,” he said.

The court said it was unfair to deny reservations to those who convert.The bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy was hearing a PIL by P Srinivas challenging the notification earmarking 2% reservations for Dalit Christians by the social welfare department for those seeking admission into Class 5.The bench pointed out that the purpose of reservation was to uplift those who were weak and deprived. The petitioner's counsel Harinath argued that once an SC person converts to Christianity, they cannot be granted a reservation. Brushing aside this contention, the bench said that the state and the society should never try to keep a person backwards.“By conversion, only the nomenclature of the person changes, but not his backwardness, poverty. The central philosophy of the reservations is to attend to the more oppressed and backwards,” the bench said adding: “If the state decides to be more liberal and provides some space for the converts, there is nothing wrong in it.”“You have to look at the purpose. The state wants to uplift those who were suppressed for thousands of years whose conversion to Christianity will not make them forward,” the CJ said.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74609766,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-116501,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-lauds-state-for-2-quota-to-dalit-christians-in-gurukuls/articleshow/74602575.cms

It also hit a two-year low of 32,493 intra-day.In four sessions this week, the sensex has lost nearly 4,800 points, or 12.7%. And if early trends on Wall Street are anything to go by, Friday's session is unlikely to bring any respite to Dalal Street investors as both Dow Jones and S&P500 tanked over 7% when trading opened, triggering a 15-minute halt in the US markets.The day's session in India witnessed about 1,200 stocks, including RIL, TCS and SBI, hitting their 52-week low levels.

Investors were also jittery because of the continuous selling by foreign investors who have taken out over Rs 26,500 crore (about $3.5 billion) from the Indian stock market in March as global fund managers are looking to be either in cash or in safer investments like gold and US treasuries.Relentless selling by foreign portfolio investors has been impacting the strength of the rupee, which on Thursday closed 58 paise weaker at 74.22 against the dollar, near its all-time low.Late evening, SGX Nifty, the futures index on the Nifty that is traded on the Singapore bourse, was down more than 6% to below 8,900.

NGO ‘Wells on Wheels’ contributed water-wheel carts to these women. Members of the British rock band ‘Alexis Kings’ distributed the carts during their maiden visit to the country.

“We had joined hands with the NGO in UK, which asked us to do the noble work. We are happy to have contributed to the noble cause in our own way,” the band members told TOI.

A private company designed the carts in a way such that it has a capacity to carry 45 litre of water at one go and is easy to pull. The cart has a large round leak-proof drum with a cap made out of a food-grade human-safe high-density polyethylene, which can be rolled along the ground for easier transport. The carts can handle wear and tear for upto 7,000km.

The NGO had started distributing such carts in Maharashtra in June last year. Since then, they have distributed 266 carts in six villages of Nashik district namely Dhaur, Umareshwar Vasti, Thangaon, Dahiwad, Shirsate and Sangamner.

The NGO’s ground team manager, Ajay Deore, said, “It was founder chairman of Wells on Wheels Shaz Memon’s idea to bring water carts to villages where woman have to carry pots and vessels on their head. We did a survey of such villages in the district and identified a few for distribution.”

The survey revealed that girl students arrived late to school as they had to make more than three rounds to fill water from the wells,said Deore.

“Earlier, we would carry only 20 litre water from the well, which is more than a kilometre away from our houses. The cart given to us has done away with most of our difficulties,” said Vandana Gaikwad, a recipient who works at a nearby farm.

LUCKNOW: Making a pitch for zero budget farming, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has said that a single stray cattle can provide sufficient fertiliser for a 30 acre farm each year. Speaking at a skill development programme in Lucknow on Thursday, the CM said the government could start a project around cows, where research would be conducted on the benefits of cows, including use of its dung and urine. This could generate employment as well, he said.

“We should start focussing on zero budget farming, which has several more benefits compared to normal or even organic farming. In this, no chemicals or pesticides are used. A single stray cattle can produce fertiliser for a 30 acre farm for a year which will generate better produce compared to organic farming. The state has already got some farmers trained in this,” he said.

Cow dung, he added, can also be used to replace wood used for cremations.

“The government is making every effort to make youth self-sufficient by training them. In order to provide employment, the government has connected the youth with the skill development department and is constantly working to promote traditional industries. In just one year, five lakh youth gained employment through the ‘one district-one product’ scheme,” Yogi said.

Yogi also launched the CM Youth Hub and CM Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme. All self-employment schemes currently being run by various departments will now be integrated under the Yuva Hub. Through this programme, assistance and guidance will be given to youth through vocational and skill training to set up their own enterprises. Under this scheme, 30,000 startup units will be set up in one year.

Under the apprenticeship scheme, the government will reimburse the honorarium being paid by industries to youth apprentices. In addition, district skill development plans have been prepared for each district in which Rs 2 lakh will be provided to each district.

The government has also signed an MoU with IIT-Kanpur to train youth for world and national skills competitions. Another MoU was signed with IIM-Lucknow under which IIM will provide managerial support for the CM Youth Programme. A third MoU was signed between the basic education department and the Uttar Pradesh Skill Development Mission to bring the children into mainstream education.

Nagaraju used to spend a lot of time at Srinivas’s house and he knew his family members well. Nagaraju was in the know of Srinivas keeping a significant cash at home to pay to the workers. He along with Raju planned the murder of Lakshmi and steal the valuables from the house,” Nizamabad town inspector B Satyanarayana said.

As per the plan, at 1.05 pm on March 9, Nagaraju entered the house when she was alone and attacked her with an iron rod. He also slit her throat with a knife and stole the ornaments she was wearing. “Raju watched videos on how to commit a murder, how to distract sniffer dogs and how to divert police attention. He used voice search to look for particular videos. He also watched a few movies, including ‘Dandupalyam,’ to see how people are murdered. As per Raju’s instructions, Nagaraju severed Lakshmi’s two toes to steal her silver toe rings. The idea was to send investigators on a wild goose chase by making them believe that Parthi gang from Maharashtra or a gang of robbers from Bihar was involved,” said the inspector.

Dandupalyam was a crime film and the plot was based on the real-life exploits of a gang named ‘Dandupalya.’

Raju also told Nagaraju to sprinkle tamarind and vermilion near the body to make it look like an act of black magic. He also asked him to light an oil lamp and leak gas to burn all the evidence. But after committing the murder, Nagaraju experienced sudden remorse as Lakshmi had been providing him food in the last nine years. “He even arranged oil lamps near the body and prayed for her soul to rest in peace. He also touched her feet seeking forgiveness,” the inspector said.

As the couple’s pet, a German Shepherd, did not bark at the time of the murder, cops suspected the involvement of someone who handled the pet. The needle of suspicion pointed at Nagaraju and police picked him up.

NEW DELHI: Akhbari Begum was awaiting the birth of her great grandchild, but the 85-year-old resident of Khajuri Khas in northeast Delhi did not live to see the day. Her house in Gamri Extension was set ablaze by rioters on February 25 and she suffocated to death. On Wednesday, Delhi Police arrested two brothers who live five houses away for the crime.

Begum often exchanged greetings with Arun and Varun when their paths crossed. Begum’s son, Mohammed Saeed Salmani, recalled how neighbourly relations changed drastically on that fateful February 25. He was out buying milk when he received a call from his son, who breathlessly informed him that an armed mob had entered their lane and were setting shops and houses on fire. Salmani rushed back to find their four-storey house in flames, his family on the roof.

Ironically, Salmani had apparently run into the same group of men earlier and told them to return home to safety since there was tension in the air. The men had later torched Salmani’s house. Each floor of the house had been ransacked. A room in which his mother had taken refuge was locked from outside, trapping her in “the smoke furnace”, as he described it. “We tried to go upstairs to rescue her, but we couldn’t do much because of the dense smoke,” Salmani said. “Police rescued other members of the family, but my mother was trapped.”

On Thursday, Begum’s family told TOI that though they had received a compensation of Rs 10 lakh from Delhi government, the amount was no recompense for their losses, both emotional and monetary. “This sum will not even help us repair the scorched house, let alone buy all the things we lost and need to replace,” Salmani said. “We have been staying at a relative’s house for the last couple of weeks, but don’t know how long this arrangement can continue.”

TOI had spoken to Arun and Varun on February 26 in their home, located on the same lane as Begum’s house. They swore they hadn’t seen what the rioters had done out on the streets. “We were at home when the mob arrived,” one of the brothers had said. “We were very scared when we later learnt what had happened. We didn’t know the woman (Begum) too well, but always greeted her when we saw her. Whatever happened is really sad and leaves us frightened too.”

The duo was arrested from their home on Wednesday for being participants in the mob attack. On Thursday, their sister maintained, “I believe that my brothers are innocent. They could not have been a part of the mob. They can never harm the neighbours in this manner,” she claimed.

The detailed judgment is awaited, while the matter of appointing an arbitrator is pending in the Punjab and Haryana high court.It was on December 30, 2005, that the MC had signed the agreement with Jaypee to set up and run a plant for recycling solid waste of the city. In its application moved under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, Jaypee’s counsel Rohit K Aggarwal claimed the termination notice of March 3 (issued on March 5) to be “illegal and arbitrary”. He sought restraining orders against hostile takeover of the plant in Sector 38 West.The company’s counsel sought to directions to the MC “to furnish adequate security of Rs 35 crore for the salvage value by way of bank guarantee or deposit of cash before they take over the possession of the MSW (municipal solid waste) plant.” He argued that the MC had done “wrongful” interpretation of National Green Tribunal’s orders of February 12 and threatened hostile takeover in gross violation of the implementation agreement. The lawyer said the termination notice must be of 180 days at least, with a cure period notice of 90 days for the rectification of any default.The application says the plant was built in 2008 for more than Rs 32 crore to process 500 metric tonnes of garbage a day but it ran into huge losses despite a monthly cost of up to Rs 60 lakh. A dispute over the payment of tipping fee was brewing between the two parties for long. Jaypee even stopped work in 2016 to force the MC to pay this fee but, after NGT’s orders, it resumed operation and spent more than Rs 7 crore on upgrading the plant.Its lawyer has argued that the MC failed to abide by the NGT orders for deploying machines and manpower to segregate waste on Japyee’s site and supply it under the terms of the solid waste management rules.Box:Jaypee’s argumentsMC should furnish security of Rs 35 crore for the salvage value before takeoverThe MC did wrong interpretation of NGT’s orders and threatened hostile takeover in violation of the dealTermination notice must be of 180 days at least, with 90 days for rectification of defaultThe plant built in 2008 for more than Rs 32 crore to process 500 metric tonnes of garbage a day ran into huge losses despite a monthly cost of Rs 60 lakhMC wasn’t paying tipping fee for longMC defied NGT orders for deploying machines and manpower to segregate waste",chandigarh,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74609513,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-345637,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/waste-plant-takeover-stayed-for-3-months/articleshow/74601667.cms

LUCKNOW: The state BJP has set its eyes on the forthcoming panchayat elections to test its preparations for the crucial 2022 UP elections. The party brass has asked its cadre to strengthen the organizational structure at the grassroots level to take on the Opposition.

The decision was taken at a meeting convened by UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and BJP organisational secretary Sunil Bansal in Lucknow on Thursday to review the preparations for the panchayat elections due by year end. Addressing the party workers, Bansal emphasized on a robust and well-coordinated organizational strength — from divisional to the block level — to ensure party’s victory in the panchayat elections.

Bansal also pressed for deploying cadres who could raise the issue of nationalism at the grassroots level. Sources said BJP plans to identify the local bodies where its organizational strength is strong and it can register wins.

BJP general secretary Vijay Bahadur Pathak said that only after the organizational structure vis-s-vis panchayat election is constituted, the party would hold meetings at the divisional, district and block levels to frame the poll strategy. Sources said the party plans not to allow the Opposition any opportunity to resurrect itself at the grassroots ahead of 2022 elections.

Bansal said the previous SP and BSP regimes used muscle and money power to win panchayat elections, leading to rampant corruption at the local level. “The party seeks win of candidates who work for development of local areas,” he added.

He also said nothing comes from the Centre as a favour to states.He told the assembly that Telangana, in the last six years, had sent Rs 50,000 crore towards taxes to the Centre and got only Rs 24,000 crore from it.Taking objection to lone BJP MLA Raja Singh’s remarks as to what had come from the Centre to Telangana (“Kendra se kya aaya”) during a heated discussion on the budget, the CM said nothing comes for free. “Whichever party sits in the Centre, it has to give states their share in taxes. It is not a favour they are doing to states.”He said the Centre has a constitutional duty. “Kendra kya aasman pe bhaitha hai kya? Delhi mein hi tho bhaitha hai (Is Centre sitting in the sky, it’s only in Delhi),” he shot back at Raja Singh.Explaining how states get funds from the Centre, he said apart from the share in taxes paid by states to the Centre, they also get money for implementation of central schemes where states and Centre have to contribute. “ Now, these people are asking us to do railway works on our own. They (BJP) have become worse than Congress,” he said.He said Telangana in all these years had never got more Rs 10,000 crore funds from the central pool in a year. “Please, don’t be under the illusion that Centre gives us huge funds. We don’t beg like other states. Telangana is one of the six states which contribute to the country’s development apart from making rapid strides. This is Telangana. People understand what is Telangana,” he said.Not sparing the Congress-led former UPA government, he said Congress also used to avoid giving the state its due share. “The then finance minister Chidambaram introduced CST and did not gave funds to states,” he alleged.Saying that by introducing GST, he said BJP had become much worse than Congress. “When GST was being discussed , we have clearly told the Centre that the tax system cannot be trusted. Then, they made some changes in the GST Act that if the states do not realise taxes below 14%, compensation will be given by the Centre for five years,” he said.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74605893,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-270448,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/centre-giving-part-of-taxes-not-doing-favour-to-t-kcr/articleshow/74602597.cms

HYDERABAD: After seeking funds for development of Simhavahini Mahankali temple at Lal Darwaza in the Old City a couple of weeks ago, AIMIM has asked the government to declare a government holiday for Mahaveer Jayanti on April 6.

Raising the issue during zero hour in the assembly on Thursday, party MLA Mohammad Moazam Khan said the city is home to Jain community people and the government should consider a holiday instead of an optional holiday. “Many states like Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have declared a government holiday on Mahaveer jayanti,” the MLA pointed out.

Making a paradigm shift to get out of the image that it works only for Muslim minorities and raises issues pertaining to minorities, AIMIM is now trying to win the hearts of Hindu communities also in an attempt to expand its base.

Party president Asaduddin Owaisi has already been talking about Dalits and backward communities’ rights on various platforms.

Brijesh added that immediate intervention of government and ministers is needed to resolve the crisis.Assistant medical superintendent at SCT and blood bank in-charge Dr S Satyabhama said that interventions are needed. “Our daily requirement is 30-40 units of blood. There are emergency and scheduled surgeries. If the crisis continues, it will affect surgeries. I would like to appeal to the public who don’t have travel histories to affected areas and exposure to affected persons to come forward and donate,” she said.Dr Meena D, professor and head, transfusion medicine department, Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, said that the situation is unsatisfactory, but not critical. “Our requirement is over 200 units per day. The number of daily donations was around 100, which has got reduced to 50-60. Since we deal with lot of emergency cases, we have to use the stocked units. For example, we had to give around 20 units for a delivery happened at night. We also have to provide to neighbouring hospitals, if they report shortage,” she said.Baby P S, senior manager, PR and CSR, Terumo Penpol, said that around 10,000 donations are needed in the district per day. “Each donation can be split into red blood cells, plasma and platelets. While medical college and SCT need more red blood cells, RCC requires platelets. There is a need for community blood banks so that all donations can be managed and requirements can be made judiciously,” she said.",thiruvananthapuram,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/covid-19-concerns-hit-blood-banks/articleshow/74601724.cms

166,['13/03/2020'],Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao nominates Keshava Rao and Suresh Reddy for Rajya Sabha berth,"CM K Chandrashekar Rao with former speaker KR Suresh Reddy on Thursday

HYDERABAD: Eighty-year-old K Keshava Rao got third-time lucky as TRS president and CM K Chandrasekhar Rao chose seniority and decided to send him to the Rajya Sabha again to fill one of the two vacancies from state. Former assembly speaker KR Suresh Reddy, who jumped into TRS from Congress just before the assembly polls, was the other nominee.

With this, speculation over KCR’s daughter, former Nizamabad MP Kalvakuntla Kavitha entering the Upper House as one of the TRS’s nominees has ended.

Three months shy of his 81st birthday, Keshava Rao, popularly known as KK, was a member of the Rajya Sabha twice from AP (2006-2012 and 2014-2020). KCR on Thursday handed over B-forms to KK and Suresh, who would file nominations on Friday. Since TRS has enough numbers to win both the seats, their unanimous election will be a mere formality.

KK joined TRS in 2013 after a long stint in Congress. He was PCC chief in the undivided AP and was made Rajya Sabha member on Congress ticket. In the second term, he became MP on TRS ticket in 2014 while continuing as party secretary general. “Taking his seniority into consideration, the party leadership (read KCR) has decided to give him another opportunity,” a senior party leader averred. KK served as a cabinet minister in three consecutive governments in undivided AP and held key portfolios like education, industry and labour.

On the other hand, Suresh, who was a four-time MLA from Balkonda constituency in Nizamabad, was initially fancied to get an MLC berth from Nizamabad.

The minister, who was caught in a war of words with CLP leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka while taking part in a debate on the Budget, said Congress had not learnt from its mistakes. “They thought that due to economic slowdown, the government may not be able to make big allocations in the budget, but chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has told us not to cut even a single rupee. We have made more allocations for more beneficiaries,” he said.

He said the allegation that TRS extended benefits to people only during elections was false. “The CM introduced Rythu Bandhu and Kalyana Lakshmi which were not in our poll manifesto. During your (Congress) regime, it was ‘current bandh’ (power cuts) for farmers. But, in our time, the CM introduced Rythu Bandhu,” he thundered. People have been teaching Congress lessons in every election, but they do not understand,” he said.

The minister also said the state would continue to borrow and spend it on capital expenditure and not on revenue expenditure.

168,['13/03/2020'],CCTV shows 5 men breaking into iPhone shop in Bengaluru,"The gang broke into a mobile phone shop and walked away with 54 iPhones worth 32 lakh

BENGALURU: A day after 54 iPhones were burgled from a store in Gandhi Bazaar , Basavanagudi , verification of CCTV footage from an adjacent building showed a gang of five men targeting the shop .

The gang decamped with 54 mobile phones worth Rs 32 lakh, Rs 2.1 lakh in cash and digital video recorder of CCTVs from iAstra, an authorised iPhone dealer, which is a part of Arjay Retail.

Complainant Dipesh HP, owner of the shop, and jurisdictional Basavanagudi police said iAstra is an authorised iPhone dealer. The TOI report on the burglary (March 12), mentioned iAstra as a resale shop, based on information provided by police. It has since been learnt that the store only sells boxed handsets that are new.

Two CCTV footage that run for 10.5 minutes and 8.2 minutes, respectively revealed the burglary took place between 4.30am and 5am on Tuesday. TOI has a copy of the videos. In the footage, the gang of five is seen wearing caps. While one of them stands guard on the road, four others carrying backpacks reach the store. They are seen carrying equipment needed to break into the store.

‘Gang made multiple attempts’

Of the four, three start breaking the lock, while the fourth one is seen bringing out a bedsheet. He holds it as a cover, preventing passersby from seeing what the other three are up to. The activity suddenly pauses and the men leave the spot only to return within minutes. “In 30 minutes, the gang made multiple attempts to enter the shop and succeeded only in the last try. One of them entered the shop and came out with the loot a few minutes later, after which they all fled the spot,” a police officer said.

The dog and fingerprint squads examined the crime scene on Tuesday morning. Shop owner Dipesh submitted to police a list of the stolen devices, the models and international mobile equipment identity (IMEI) numbers.

Police have formed a team to trace and nab the miscreants.

PRAYAGRAJ: The Ganga Task Force (GTF), the Territorial Army team of 137 Composite Ecological Task Force (CETF) Bn (TA) 39 Gorkha Rifles, entrusted with the mandate of conserving the Ganga basin is also working to rejuvenate the lost forest cover through afforestation and thereby minimising soil erosion. The team has been working for afforestation by using ‘seed balls ’ — soil along with equal amount of clay, humus and ash in the shape of a ball and having two-four seeds of some indigenous trees at the centre. The seed ball is around two inches in diameter.

Since its raising on May 2019, the task force has manufactured over seven lakhs seed balls out of which 6.4 lakhs have already been scattered on the fallow land. The seed balls are distributed among pilgrims, farmers, students, organisations, army units etc. in Prayagraj, Kanpur and Varanasi.

Colonel Amit Pande, in-charge GTF said, “We have four machines at our unit, each having the capacity of manufacturing 10,000 seed balls per day. About 2-4 seeds of indigenous trees are kept in the mix of soil, clay, humus and ash and given shape of a ball, which is then dried.”

“Each seed ball has a survival period of 11 months. As soon as it gets get some moisture, the seed starts sprouting, drawing nutrition from the enclosing mix of soil, humus and ash and germinates into a plant,” said Col Pande, who has been decorated with Nau Sena medal. The unit has used seeds of 26 different indigenous species, including jackfruit, guava, bel, arjun, aaonla, blackberry, in these balls to ensure a variety of flora.

Another student from St. Ursula Samiksha Mahajan said the exam was neither too difficult not extremely easy. She said, “Excluding the last two questions (including the 5th one), other ones were much simpler. Each question was from the textbook or related to the concepts that we had done before, which made it easier.”

While Aaaif Hussain from Anjuman High School had trouble solving many questions, his batchmate Arman Khan could solve the exam without any problem and way before the time limit.

Hussain said, “I found the question on quadratic equations difficult. Lengthwise, the paper was appropriate and I managed to finish it on time.”

Jayabal with 14 other Indians were stopped from taking a flight on March 10 from Rome to India after the Indian government wanted to ensure that all the passengers carry a Covid-19 negative certificate to board the flight.

Jayabal says they have nearly become refugees in Italy because neither the Indian government is allowing them to return nor it is ensuring that they are taken care of.

The businessman says that the hotline offered for emergencies by the embassy does not work and people must dial 20 to 30 times to even reach them. “The only reply given by the embassy to us is that they have taken up the issue with the health ministry to get us an exemption or that we just have to spend more time in Italy. Why can’t the government quarantine us for 14 days or more after we reach home?” He says there are more than 45 Indians stranded like him in Rome. tnn

TRS’s Parkal MLA Challa Dharma Reddy had the assembly in splits on Thursday when he said they have had enough of the endless wait for officials to change the name of Dongala Singaram village to Pragati Singaram. Dongala in Telugu is an offensive word meaning thieves and Dharma Reddy hails from the village.

Raising the issue during the zero hour, Dharma Reddy, a two-time MLA, said the village panchayat had passed a resolution in 1996, which was later approved by the then district collector of Warangal . “But, the new name is not reflecting in the official records since the government has not issued a gazette notification. And it has been 24 years since a resolution was passed,” he said.

The MLA, who won the first term on a TDP ticket, said locals feel shy to even utter the name of the village since they consider it as a stigma. Imploring chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao , the TRS legislator said: “The chief minister should take a call on our plea and resolve the issue immediately,” he said. The chief minister was not present in the house when Dharma Reddy was making an impassionate plea.

He said he had raised the issue in the assembly thrice but no corrective action had been taken. “While for communication and non-official purposes, locals have been using the name of Pragati Singaram, for government records such as pattadar passbooks, revenue records and other communication Dongala Singaram name is still being used by the officials concerned,” Dharma Reddy told TOI later.

He further said thanks to confusion over the village name , there have been instances of passport applications getting rejected by the authorities. “A government notification is mandatory for making any changes in the names of villages,” he explained.

The village now falls under Bhupalpally constituency after the delimitation exercise. Former speaker S Madhusudhana Chary represents the seat. “Even I brought the issue to the notice of Chary, but the name of our village has not been changed in the official records,” Dharma Reddy rued.

So, in a towering tribute to mentors who fire imagination of students and instil in them a love for learning, Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT) will raise arguably the region’s tallest building to house teachers on its campus.

The Union HRD ministry has already sanctioned a corpus of Rs 40 crore for the G+12 building with a total 48 flats, which will boast all modern amenities.

“The ambitious project has received the Centre’s go-ahead and funds. The central public works department (CPWD) will complete construction within the next 30 months,” said MNNIT director Rajeev Tripathi.

The new building will come up on a swathe of land on the campus that already houses a hostel for students, living quarters for teachers and the NIT guest house, among others. “Each of the 48 flats will boast a 3BHK floor plan while the tower will be equipped with a wide stairway, elevators and firefighting arrangements,” the director said.

Professor Tripathi maintained that the institute had long been facing an accommodation crunch for teachers because of which a detailed project report was prepared and sent to the Union ministry for approval and sanction of funds. “We received the nod recently. Construction will begin at the earliest,” he said.

Currently, the MNNIT has 223 teachers against 362 sanctioned posts of professors, associate professors and assistant professors. A recruitment process is underway to fill up the 108 vacant posts.

“We must hence overcome the accommodation crisis to ensure both old and new teachers are allotted quarters as per their entitlement,” Tripathi added.

On Thursday morning, the victim’s family refused to cremate her till chief minister Yogi Adityanath came and assured them of strict and swift action against the guilty. They also demanded compensation for girl’s parents. The child’s body was brought home from the mortuary late Wednesday.

The girl had died on Tuesday night at Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital after excessive bleeding from her private parts. The girl had gone to attend the ‘phaag’ singing programme on Tuesday afternoon, when she was raped by an unidentified man.

Senior government officers, including district magistrate Ravindra Singh and superintendent of police Vikrant Veer visited the girl’s home in Bihar police station area to pacify the family.

The family agreed to perform the last rites after negotiations with the DM and senior police officials. The DM handed over a cheque of Rs 5 lakh as ex-gratia compensation to the kin. “We have assured support to the family and promised that the accused will be arrested soon,” he said. The autopsy report confirmed death due to excessive bleeding.

The last rites were performed at the girl’s ancestral farm, 300m off the village amid tight security. Leaders of Samajwadi Party, including MLC Sunil Sajan, were present.

The girl’s kin said the accused responsible for her death should either be hanged or ‘chased and gunned down’ like the Telangana case, where four rape accused were shot by Hyderabad Police.

Talking to TOI, ASP (North) Unnao Vinod Kumar Pandey said, “Four teams are working for an early breakthrough. We have picked up a few suspects for questioning to ascertain the identity of the perpetrator. An FIR under relevant Sections of IPC, including rape, murder and sections of Pocso Act has been registered.

After meeting the seer, Singh urged environmentalists from across the world to reach Matri Sadan on March 20 “to formulate a strategy to save the river from mining mafias, hydropower plants and pollution.”

Addressing mediapersons, Singh said, “We want everyone to participate in Ganga satyagraha that will be started by Swami Shivanand Saraswati on March 20. We will also commence the task of formulating a strategy to save the river which is struggling to save itself from immense anthropogenic pressure. In spite of ban on construction of dams on upper reaches of Ganga, the government is going ahead with its plans. This is a threat to the existence of one of the largest water resource of the nation.”

Meanwhile, seer Padmavati who had been fasting for over 90 days for the Ganga cause, continues to be in the ICU of AIIMS-Delhi. Sources at the ashram said she is suffering from neurological problems and is unable to speak or move.

Nanded-Mumbai CST (Train No. 17611) Rajya Rani Express and Nagpur-Mumbai CST (No. 11402) Nandigram Express will not ply on Friday. The return journeys of these two trains for Saturday also stand cancelled.

Also, Secunderabad-Mumbai CST (No. 17058) Devgiri Express will be regulated in Bhusaval division on Friday. Expressing regret over inconvenience to be caused to the passengers, SCR authorities said passengers who have booked their tickets for trains to be cancelled will get their refunds.

The announcement of cancellation, which has allegedly come on a short-notice, has irked railway activists.

“The railway authorities are communicating about cancellation of trains barely before 48 to 72 hours. The traffic block is planned well in advance and therefore it makes no sense to announce cancellation of trains on such a short-notice. The poor communication is bound to cause huge inconvenience to the passengers as all cancelled trains witness huge crowd every day,” railway activist Raj Somani said.

When contacted, SCR officials blamed the Central Railway over the issue. “The Central Railway did not communicate us about the traffic block in advance,” a senior SCR official said.

Meanwhile, the SCR has announced permanent augmentation of Purna-Patna-Purna Express (Nos. 17610/17609) with one AC III Tier coach and two sleeper class coaches.

185,['13/03/2020'],Lieutenant governor does not have unfettered discretion:CM,"Puducherry: The Madras high court has directed the Centre, the administrator (lieutenant governor) and Puducherry government to work within the framework of the Constitution of India, the Government of Union territories’ act, 1963 and Rules of Business of the Government of Pondicherry, 1963, said chief minister V Narayanasamy. Narayanasamy while commenting on the order at a press conference on Thursday said the high court has directed all authorities (the Centre, the lieutenant governor and the Puducherry government) to exercise their powers under the Constitution to fulfil ‘sovereign will’ of the people.

Narayanasamy claimed that as per the existing rules and regulations, the administrator can act only as per the aid and advice of the council of ministers and cannot outrightly reject any proposal or direct the authorities to act otherwise. But the administrator can call for clarifications on the proposals from the secretaries concerned, who can submit information to the administrator through the chief minister. If differences of opinion persist between the administrator and council of ministers, the administrator can refer the issue to the President, said Narayanasamy.

He said the high court while observing Centre’s comments declared that ‘discretion’ of the administrator does not mean ‘unfettered discretion’. “The word, ‘discretion’ does not mean unfettered discretion and rather should be read as ‘judicious discretion’ to eliminate any sense of misunderstanding about the word, ‘discretion’, he quoted the order.

Narayanasamy said the high court also cautioned the Centre to act within the limitations of the Constitution and not beyond the same, subject to the laws made by the Parliament. “…the popularly elected government headed by the chief minister and the administrator/lieutenant governor of Puducherry shall work in unison and not in division,” he said quoting the order.

He said the bench also cited relevant portions of the Supreme Court judgment in the case between NCT of Delhi and Union of India.

“if a well-deliberated legitimate decision of the council of ministers is not given effect due to an attitude to differ on the part of the lieutenant governor, then the concept of collective responsibility would stand negated,” Narayanasamy said quoting the Supreme Court order.

He said the high court declared that the ‘will of the people is the only legitimate foundation of any government and to protect its free expression should be our first object’.

He claimed that the high court declared that the popularly-elected government of Puducherry, no doubt, represents the will of the people as Edmund Burke said, ‘In all forms of government, people are the true legislators’.

However, the exam held on Thursday provided a huge sigh of relief to the Std X CBSE students . They said that the exam was easy, to the point and 100% from the prescribed NCERT syllabus.

Bhavesh Choudhary from St Pauls School said the paper was indeed easy. “I had opted for standard maths. Section C was the easiest but section D was a little bit of a challenge. Thankfully, the time was sufficient to complete the exam.”

Shujat Qureshi, a maths teacher at Central India Public School (CIPS), also agreed that the exam was easy. “Everything was from the NCERT book. If the students studied it, they should have been able to crack the exam. The exam was a confident booster. Some of the students also told me that they could finish the exam in just two hours. They are all expecting to pass with flying colours.”

Rishabh Chandak from BVM said he was able to finish the exam an hour before the stipulated time. “All the sections were pretty easy and straightforward. I am quite optimistic and expecting high marks this time.”

Shruti Anchalwar, also from BVM, said the final section was a tough nut to crack. “Apart from that, the exam was very simple and easy, especially the MCQs in section A.”

It was completely opposite for Anchalwar’s batchmate Shrushti Joshi. “Section D was the easiest and the MCQs in section A were challenging. However, I was able to finish the exam in time.”

Himanshu Lalwani from Delhi Public School found section B tough. “Other sections were relatively easy and I am confident that I will score good marks.”

188,['13/03/2020'],Pon Radhakrishnan welcomes Rajini’s move to enter politics,"Salem: Former Union minister Pon Radhakrishnan on Thursday said actor Rajinikanth was always welcome to make his entry into politics. “Everyone expected and wished that he would join the BJP. But he announced that he will float a new party of his own. So, it wasn’t appropriate for us to ask him to join us,” he said.

The BJP leader, however, said Rajini had made a blunder by helping the DMK to come to power in the state in 1996. “But he proved in that election that he has enough influence among the masses to help one grab the chief minister’s post.”

Pon Radhakrishnan was in the city to attend the wedding reception of BJP functionary ‘auditior’ V Ramesh’s daughter Smirithi, who got married to Harish alias Adiya Janardhanan, recently.

He also used the occasion to appeal the Muslims not to believe the DMK on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) issue. “It won’t affect the Muslims. The Congress and the DMK are gearing up to create riots among the Hindus and Muslims. They are still using the 1967 election formula today.”

Earlier, Telangana governor Dr Tamilisai Soundarrajan had on Wednesday said talks were on between Tamil Nadu and Telangana regarding the Cauvery-Godavari river linking project and tourism related development works. “I will act as a bridge between the two states in all the development projects and schemes.”

She was also in the city to attend the wedding reception. Tamilisai said she was proud to read out Thirukkural during the assembly session in Telangana, recently. “While I am the governor of Telangana, I am still a daughter of Tamil Nadu.”

State BJP general secretary Vanathi Srinivasan, meanwhile, said the party had proved its guts by appointing L Murugan, a scheduled caste, as the state president. “None of the political party will do like this. The BJP has given respect to scheduled caste people by appointing Murugan the party state president.”

192,['13/03/2020'],HC interventions upheld justice for Puducherry: Bedi,"Puducherry: The intervention of the Madras high court has upheld the justice for the Union territory of Puducherry on several occasions, said lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi.

Bedi while listing out the occasions said the high court in the last two years intervened and fixed the fees charged by the private medical colleges, and granted voting rights for nominated MLAs and facilitated the direct transfer of funds in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries' besides upholding the mode of appointment of state election commissioner (SEC).

The latest order of the bench of Madras high court on Wednesday asserted the role of the lieutenant governor as a bridge between the Union territory and the Centre, she said.

""The first judicial intervention was of capping of exorbitant fees being charged by private medical colleges. This intervention ensured relief to aspiring and deserving students and parents from run-away fees which were being charged by private medical colleges. (This decision is leading to systems change around the country. It's a process),"" she said.

Bedi said nominated MLAs secured a judicial order with voting rights to exercise their rights and responsibilities as members of the legislative assembly. ""This makes them active members of the assembly to represent the people,"" she said.

The judiciary again directed the Union territory to comply with the directions of the Centre to implement the free rice scheme under direct bank transfer (DBT) mode transferring the cash equivalent of rice to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. The high court order also confirmed the Union territory status of Puducherry.

Similarly, in another order, the judiciary has affirmed the fairness in the open process to select the SEC. ""The selection of SEC to be by open selection and not the nomination. This ensures professionalism in the open selection of the commissioner for conducting local body elections. (Being held after a gap of 10 years). This affirms fairness in all selection process,"" she said.

The latest judicial intervention reaffirmed the supremacy of the Parliament-enacted Union territory act and the Business rules with clarity in their applicability and accountability. The order overturned Madras high court single judge verdict, which led to divergent interpretations.

""...judiciary interventions arrived at a considerable time-energy of the Central government, Puducherry administration, eminent legal luminaries and precious time of the honourable courts. We thank them all,"" she said.

Bedi expressed optimism that the reiterated judicial clarity will help the administration to take decisions expeditiously based on existing procedures to serve the Union territory better.

The work of construction wall of the nullah was stopped due to lack of funds.

Incidentally, the work of construction of nullah in the Jai Bhawani Nagar area was taken up by the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) in 2016. However, the work was delayed due to various reasons in the last three years.

In June 2018, the nullah had started overflowing after a spell of heavy rainfall. A local resident lost his life after falling into the nullah.

According to AMC engineers, the construction of retaining wall of 570 metre stretch of nullah has been completed. The stretch of the nullah in lane number 8 and 9, totalling 150 metres length, is still pending. The contractor awarded the project has stopped the work for the last one year as his payment has been stalled by the municipal corporation.

The nullah becomes a virtual death trap during every monsoon when it overflows due to rainwater. People residing in houses closely constructed on both sides of the nullah fear falling into it as it is left open.

On Wednesday, Gaikwad, an independent corporator from the Bharat Nagar ward, initiated the work of laying covers over the open end of the nullah. When asked, Gaikwad said that everyone knows about the financial situation of the AMC. “Hardly a fortnight ago, a child had fallen into the open stretch of the nullah. Locals of the area sought help and, therefore, I am spending from my pocket to cover the nullah instead of endlessly waiting for the civic body to do something about it,” he said.

Rahul Ingle, an activist of Shahar Parivartan Aghadi, said that the municipal commissioner should release money for the project. “The AMC has received money in property tax and it should not wait until next monsoon causes mayhem in the area,” Ingle said.

AMC executive engineer Hemant Kolhe said that he will visit the site on Thursday and will take necessary action.

It is extremely important for students to be thorough with the NCERT textbook to be able to answer questions with ease. Revise the contents of each and every topic and sub-topics thoroughly from the NCERT text, diagrams and flow charts.

Students should lay more stress on the seventh, sixth and tenth units which have high weightage of marks, followed by the other units. Students should be calm and composed and use the reading time to get themselves acquainted with the paper and plan the answers which will help them manage time.

According to the latest CBSE sample paper, there will be 27 questions in all, divided into five sections. All questions are compulsory. There is no overall choice in the paper. However, internal choices are provided.

Students must be particular about spellings of key terms and names of biological species being underlined. They must use diagrams wherever required to highlight concepts. Diagrams should be drawn with correct proportions; overlapping or cross labelling should be avoided.

They should use examples and flow charts wherever necessary to help the examiner get a better overview of the concepts. Number the questions and their sub-parts correctly. Descriptive answers should be written in bullet points, using a simple language with the key words underlined.

I wish each of them good luck for their exam.

A Chennai-Bengaluru trip on Shatabdi costs Rs 845 on chair car and Rs 1,415 on executive chair car. A one-way trip on air for a spot travel to Bengaluru from Chennai is just Rs 999.

Similarly, a Mumbai-Delhi one way trip is just under Rs 2,500 or more than 20% less than rates from 2 weeks ago, going by data from travel portal ixigo. New Delhi-Bengaluru flights are 16.8% cheaper. “Some popular domestic routes have seen a 20%-25% decrease in last minute fares on account of falling oil prices. Airlines are also refraining from increasing prices at the moment as they pre-empt a weakening of demand on the domestic side,” said Aloke Bajpai, CEO, Ixigo. Delhi-Hyderabad is seeing a 30% drop while Chennai-Delhi is seeing a 22% dip. However, this drop in airfares has not improved the traveller sentiments. While until 2 weeks ago, travellers refrained from international vacations and made domestic bookings, the fresh scare of new infections in India has weakened domestic demand too. Travel companies are seeing a 20%-35% cancellation queries and a drop in bookings. Travel portal Cleartrip, whose airfares see an aggregate drop of 12% for domestic routes sees a dip in bookings. “Early trends of summer travel seem subdued, with bookings seeing a 15%-20% drop for domestic vacations. And it is not just to the destinations where there are higher number of infections, the overall caution is reflecting in a drop in bookings,” said Balu Ramachandran, senior vice president, Cleartrip.

Yatra.com sees airfares go down by upto 40% in the affected destinations. “Customers are wary of making fresh bookings to the affected locations and airfares to these destinations have dropped by over 40%. We have also received close to 35% cancellation queries from travelers planning their trips to foreign locations during the holiday season,” said Sabina Chopra, COO, Yatra.com.

202,['13/03/2020'],"Extend 10% EWS reservation in civil posts, Centre to Pondy","Puducherry: The Union home ministry has directed the Puducherry government to extend 10% reservation to economically weaker sections in civil posts and services. The council of ministers in August 2019 rescinded the government order passed on March 5, 2019, by the department of personnel and administrative reforms extending 10% reservation for EWS.

However, lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi did not approve the council's decision and referred the issue to the Union home ministry. The ministry examined the matter and passed an order directing the chief secretary Ashwani Kumar to continue with 10% reservation for EWS.

Advisor to the Union territory (home) Jitendra Agrawal in an official communication to chief secretary directed the Puducherry government to continue with the 10% EWS reservation in civil posts and services as per the Union social justice and empowerment ministry's office memorandum dated January 17, 2019, and Union personnel, public grievances and pensions ministry's memorandum dated January 19, 2019.

Under-secretary to Puducherry government (personnel and administrative reforms) V Jaisankar in an official communication on Monday directed all secretariat departments and heads of the departments to follow the government order passed on March 5, 2019, reserving 10% for EWS in civil posts and services.

This is one of the several instances of the Union home ministry endorsing the views of Bedi. The ministry in December last year endorsed Bedi's suggestion to select the state election commissioner (SEC) through a transparent, competitive and fair process inviting applications through an all India advertisement.

The ministry said the selection of SEC must be made by a selection committee headed by the chief secretary. It said Bedi may finalize the composition and terms of reference of the selection committee. Bedi had referred the issue to the ministry following a difference in opinion with the council of ministers on the mode of selection of SEC.

Earlier, the ministry endorsed Bedi's suggestion and directed the Puducherry government to continue with direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme of transferring cash equivalent of rice directly to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries instead of distributing rice free of cost to the ration cardholders through the fair price shops.

Bedi and council of ministers were on the loggerheads over the mode of implementing the free rice scheme. Bedi insisted DBT mode while the council preferred to distribute rice free of cost to the ration cardholders through fair price shops.

Further, it came down to below 7,000 TEUs during February 2020.The current decline in imports through the Cochin Port and the expected fall in exports during the coming months will result in a loss of business of $2-3 million (Rs 15-22 crore) to exporters and importers (exim community) of Kochi, says the Cochin Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCCI).“Exports haven’t been affected so far but it will be affected during the next month or so. The Kuwait port is already closed and Bahrain will be closed soon. As most of our exports are to the Middle East, it is going to affect us,” said V Venugopal, president, CCCI.Venugopal said the decline in imports is troubling as it is going to affect exports also. “Imports and exports are inter-linked. Unless containers from outside reach Kochi, we won’t be able to export from here. For example, there might be some thousand empty containers sitting in Dubai, which you couldn’t bring over here to export our products, because it will be an additional cost and such actions wouldn’t sustain in a competitive market,” he said.In fact, ports have started facing container shortages and freight rates have been going up. The surplus containers for the trade comes from China.“The major area to be affected in the current crisis is China and two thirds of our imports through Cochin Port are from that country. We know that Chinese imports are not going to come during the next month also. So, you may have goods to export and there might be demand also, but you will not be able to send them unless there is supply of containers,” Venugopal said.As much as 20,000 TEUs arrive a week to India from China and that has come down to almost 6,000 TEUs.During January 2019 Kochi received 2,806 TEUs, equivalent of 2,806 twenty-foot containers from China, which came down to 2,474 TEUs this January, a decline of 332 TEUs. It is the same case with other major import sources also.Similarly, South Korea had sent 378 TEUs in Jan 2019, which declined by 163 TEUs. Striking was the decline in imports from the UAE – the imports came down from 1,323 TEUs in January 2019 to 1,006 TEUs in January 2020, a decline of 317 TEUs.The impact of Covid-19 on the industries and businesses in India is yet to unfold fully, said Antony Thomas Kottaram, director, Kottaram Trading Company, Kochi. “We will not be spared from the global economic slowdown which is expected to hit us in near future,” he said.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74605375,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-195023,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/citys-importers-exporters-stare-at-rs-15-22cr-loss-in-coming-months/articleshow/74601754.cms

JAIPUR/JAISALMER: Amid the political storm in Madhya Pradesh triggered by Jyotiraditya Scindia ’s move of quitting Congress and joining BJP, two Congress MLAs of Rajasthan lambasted the Ashok Gehlot-led government on Thursday. While Todabhim MLA Prithviraj Meena expressed his anger by saying Gehlot’s ministers were acting like “kings”, six-time legislator Hemaram Chaudhary , who now represents Gudhamalani, went on to threaten resignation as he was “losing his patience”.

Meena said no minister in the Gehlot government paid heed to issues and problems raised by him. He alleged that ministers were acting like “kings” and it was high time Gehlot took them to task.

Questioning the functioning of the government, Meena said, “The situation in Rajasthan is not any better compared to Madhya Pradesh as nobody listens to the MLAs. Crops have been badly damaged and the government has not yet announced any package. There are some ministers who consider themselves to be above the chief minister and act like kings.”

The Edappadi police have registered a case and launched a manhunt for the gang members.

A police officer identified the deceased as K Ramamurthy, 32, of Avathipalayam village. He was working as an attender with a local bar that was attached to the Tasmac outlet in Thanneerdasanur village.

“On Wednesday night, S Durairaj, 30, of Poomaniyur village and his friends came to the bar. As he was consuming liquor by leaning onto the partition wall, which was made of hollow bricks, that suddenly collapsed,” the officer said.

Ramamurthy, along with another bar attender P Annamalai, 30, of Avathipalayam, argued with Durairaj, who fought with the duo. “Meanwhile, other customers in the bar intervened and pacified the trio,” said T Thangavel, deputy superintendent of police, Sankari division.

Around 10.30pm, Durairaj, along with five accomplices, came to the bar again and hacked Ramamurthy and Annamalai indiscriminately. “Ramamurthy succumbed to his injuries on the spot, while Annamalai was critically injured,” the DSP said.

209,['13/03/2020'],Systematic study of chapters will do the trick,"The most systematic manner of studying is to do it chapterwise. While doing so, I would suggest students to write all the important properties , statement of theorems and formulae in a separate paper and revise it often.

While solving the question paper, utmost attention should paid while writing the terms ‘similar’ and ‘congruent’. Similar is not congruent. While naming similar triangles, be careful of the correspondence.

Appollonius theorem is applicable to triangles only when the median is given. The chapter on circles has many properties and theorems. Learn the application to numerals.

For questions on construction, students should draw a rough figure with measurements first to get an idea about what kind of figure needs to be drawn. Sometimes, an analysis of problems also needs to be written.

In co-ordinate geometry, negative co-ordinates should be substituted carefully. Prepare well about properties of triangles and quadrilaterals.

In trigonometry, draw a neat labelled figure before attempting the questions. Identities and standard values should be learnt.

In the questions related to mensuration, read the questions carefully by checking the units and note down the data given for a better insight about the question. Students should keep in mind to use proper conversion scale before solving the problems.

You should be very careful while noting down the data given in the question paper. I would strictly suggest not to assume any data which is not given in the question paper while solving.

I wish all the students best of luck and hope they excel in exams.

210,['13/03/2020'],Hosur cut roses go waste as coronavirus hits exports,"Krishnagiri: Once home to colourful and fragrant roses, what welcomes one to Hosur today is the sight of withered and dried up cut roses. Out of business for the past one month, the lives of cut rose exporters too are equally faded.

According to the cut rose exporters, they are facing a loss of nearly Rs 2 lakh a day as the Gulf and other foreign countries have banned the import of goods from India in the wake of coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak. As there are no takers for the flowers, which can’t be preserved for long, they end up in garbage bins, instead of flying abroad to lit up the moods of several hundreds.

Famous for cut roses, Hosur grows varieties such as red giant, red horizon, red corvette, happy hour, passion royal class, red palace, bohemia, discovery, gold strike, rimini high society, tenga venga bugatti, king fisher, apricot kiwi and avalanche classic and duet across more than 1,000 acres. The main export markets are Gulf, Europe, Japan, Southeast Asia, Australia, Middle East and Russia.

N Ahmed, an exporter, said, “The roses grown here are in high demand abroad. The flowers will be sent to all these countries throughout the year. The demand is usually high during the Valentine’s Day, when the export crosses more than 1.5 crore cut roses.”

Pointing out that they usually export four lakh cut flowers a month abroad from Bengaluru, the exporters said they hadn’t clocked any business after February 14. “The business totally depends on exports. Following the ban imposed by the Gulf and other countries, the export has come to a standstill in the region,” an exporter said.

According to them, the demand for the flowers has taken a dig in the local markets too. “We will not get good rates as this is not a marriage season. Usually, we sell a bunch of 10 gerbera flowers at Rs 150 in the local market during the festival and marriage seasons. At present, it is priced at Rs 12. We are not even getting the production cost.”

PATNA: Even as the World Health Organization has declared Covid-19 a global pandemic, the state government has rolled out measures across Bihar to contain the virus threat, keeping a strict vigil at the airports and districts bordering Nepal.

Seven additional directors of the state health department have been given the charge of the districts bordering Nepal — Madhubani, Sitamarhi, East Champaran, West Champaran, Kishanganj, Araria and Supaul — which are under special surveillance owing to a positive case of the virus in Nepal.

As part of these measures, all 38 districts have been provided isolation facilities at the nearest medical college and hospital and altogether 144 suspected cases of novel coronavirus have kept in isolation so far. Of these, 73 people have completed their 14-day quarantine. The remaining cases are still being monitored by the state health department.

Four senior health department officials been given additional duties at isolation wards of medical colleges and hospitals in four cities, including Patna, Bhagalpur, Gaya and Darbhanga.

State health department officials have issued advisory that those who have arrived from Covid-19 affected countries should self-isolate at home. “They should not go out in public gatherings irrespective of their status of being symptomatic or asymptomatic. People with similar symptoms should immediately call 104 or visit nearest government healthcare centre,” state surveillance officer Dr Ragini Mishra said.

She added, “Since the symptoms of Covid-19 are quite similar to viral fever, people even with a normal cold or cough raise their queries on the helpline number that has been provided to them. A total number of 786 calls have been received regarding the enquiry of the virus from February 5.”

According to health officials, as many as 52 samples of Covid-19 suspected patients from the state have been sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune. Sample of a suspect, who was admitted in the isolation ward of Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) was sent to NIV on Thursday. “As of now, we have received five suspected cases of Covid-19 at the PMCH. Of these, four have tested negative. Test result of the remaining case is awaited,” a senior doctor at the PMCH said.

Meanwhile, three more cases were detected in Bettiah on Thursday. “Of these, one suspect is from Lauria, Majhaulia and Narkatiaganj each. As of now, the Nakatiaganj native hasn’t reached Bettiah and the one from Majhaulia has been contacted and he will soon be kept in isolation,” said Bettiah civil surgeon Arun Kumar Sinha.

Altogether 10 people from Bettiah have completed isolation so far. “Nine people who completed 14-day quarantine in Manesar were kept in isolation for another 14 days. Even though no positive case has been detected, we are ensuring precautions,” Sinha said.

CHENNAI: Disappointing legions of his fans who have been waiting for years to see their Superstar make his political entry and become chief minister of Tamil Nadu, actor Rajinikanth on Thursday said he never wanted to become CM .

“Had I wanted to be CM, I could have got it in 1996. This is not the first time I am saying this. On December 31, 2017, I said this (when he made the announcement that he would enter politics ). Do I want to have something now that I did not want at the age of 45?” Rajinikanth said.

“When I informed district secretaries about my decision to remain the party head and not the CM candidate, they cautioned me that people would not accept this and cited other parties. I am not interested in how it works with others. I want to usher in a change, create new leaders and bring hope to people,” Rajinikanth told a gathering of reporters in a city hotel. He, however, refused to take any question at the end of his 30-minute speech.

Citing the case of DMK founder and former chief minister C N Annadurai, Rajinikanth said Anna had created so many leaders.

“We need to create more leaders and for this 65% of representation (in his party) should be given to youngsters below 50 years of age to contest elections. A fair mix of experts from various fields should also be drafted in,” the actor said.

“In Tamil Nadu, there are two political giants who are well-established. On the one side is a party that has not been in power for almost 10 years, but is backed by a strong structure and resources. After the demise of Kalaignar, the successor (M K Stalin) is under pressure to prove his capabilities. On the other side is the ruling party with its hold over the treasury of Lord Kubera. Between these two giants, we have to make our entry. It will not be an easy task,” Rajinikanth said.

KOCHI: Whether it is Onam or Christmas, Kochi’s retail market depends on products manufactured in China and shipped from a handful of ports—nine of them—to Kochi. The electronic and electrical equipment flooding the markets during festivals invariably come from China or are assembled in India using critical components coming from that country. For Christmas or Vishu, even the crackers come from China. It doesn’t stop with goods stuffed in retail shops –furniture, auto parts and roof tiles too come from China.

Kochi-headquartered Kottaram Trading Company, which markets kitchenware and home décor products, sources products largely from China. “We import 600-700 containers of products from around the world, of which 60% comes from China,” said Antony Thomas Kottaram, director, Kottaram Trading Company.

The variety of products that an average Malayali uses in his daily life, which has origins in China, is astonishing. For instance, the January 2019 list of imports from China through Cochin Port runs up to 12 pages and includes goods like fans, furniture, sanitary wares, steel pipes, lightings, tea, polyester chips, steel sinks, DVD players, TVs, gift articles, induction cookers, gas stoves, LED lamps, tents, spare parts, wheel chairs, roof tiles, hair conditioner, bathroom cabinet – the list just goes on and on.

In China, there are towns or provinces specialized in certain products, said MK Ansari, chief executive officer of Kochi-headquartered Providence Exim India, that sells premium bath and sanitarywares under the brand Kriztle.

While Guangdong, a Southern coastal province, is famous for ceramic products, Zhejiang, another coastal town focuses on machinery, furniture and sanitarywares. On the other hand, Hubei is known for its furniture and tiles and Shenzhen is home to high-tech technology products – mainly mobiles. Once the document that provides information regarding the particulars of the goods to be delivered is sent to a Chinese company, it will take 45-60 days to complete production of kitchenware, said Kottaram. “It will take another 18-24 days for shipping them to Kochi. With Wan Hai, a shipping liner, running direct lines to Kochi, it will take only 14 days now,” he added.

K Sivakumar, ranger, Thalawadi forest range, said the leopard had killed more than 10 goats and 12 stray dogs in the three hamlets in the Asanur forest division since November 2019. “It had attacked three cows in the third week of February, despite our close watch.”

The forest officials had also set up two cages with bait in them to trap the leopard in as many places, but to no avail.

Initial inquiry revealed that the animal was staying at the abandoned stone quarries near Thottaganjanur hamlet. “Since we are afraid to go to the stone quarries, we have decided to use the drone to monitor the leopard’s movement,” the forest ranger said.

Four forest department teams and a team of Asanur police have been keeping high vigil in the area. They have extended the search for the big cat to nearby forest areas as well.

In fact, wearing it even if a person is not sick could be risky.”“Common people do not know how to wear or remove the mask. They are not supposed to touch the front side of the mask as it could make them prone to the disease. They should not wear the mask unless asked by a doctor,” he said.Tracing the history of the virus, Saoji quoted researchers as saying that the disease was transferred from animals to humans, mainly bats and cats. It is similar to diseases called SARS and MERS.He asked people to avoid large gatherings and travelling in the country or abroad. “If you think a person is not well, maintain a distance of at least 2 metres (6ft). The disease is mainly transferred if a person directly comes in contact with the infected one. Respiratory droplets are another reason of causing the disease,” he added.“The common signs of infections are fever, breathing difficulties, cough, diarrhoea and shortness of breath. In severe cases, there could be pneumonia, kidney failure and ARDS,” he said.According to researchers, he said, there are no vaccines or antiviral drugs available for Covid right now.Of the 1,25,000 reported cases of Covid globally, 60,000 people have been cured while 4,600 have lost lives.

“There are people coming to Nashik by public and private vehicles. In order to ensure people do not carry the infection home and mingle with the society, we will start screening of the people at toll plazas and at bus stands,” Bhujbal, who is also the state minister for civic supplies and consumer affairs, said.

Addressing the reporters after reviewing the system put in place to identify and contain the spread of virus among the common citizens, Bhujbal said the health department and district administration has taken up measures to ensure people infected with the virus were identified at the earliest.

The guardian minister further added that the administration has identified various buildings at various places to house 390 people in quarantine so that if and when the number of such patients and suspects shoots up, the administration would be able to take all necessary measures required to treat the people as well.

Bhujbal also warned that any quarantined person found loitering around without clearance from the administration would be forcibly picked up by police and quarantined again.

The minister also sounded an alert for people who were hiding information about those affected by Covid-19 saying they would face action if found guilty. “The citizens have to be alert and they can inform police and health machinery about such occupants. If found correct, action would be taken against the guilty,” Bhujbal said.

Bhujbal also warned the traders against profiteering. He also announced that biometric authentication for beneficiaries of public distribution system has been suspended till March 31 and also beneficiaries could take home food grains for the next two months.

Meanwhile, divisional commissioner Rajaram Mane said the government has ordered positioning of health teams at state borders to ensure Covid-19 suspects or patients do not cross the borders and mingle with people.

“The orders for health squads to go to the border posts and monitor every person coming inside Maharashtra have been issued. They will scan people with symptoms of Covid-19 and take action accordingly. Every foreigner has to go through compulsory quarantine from the date of arrival,” Mane said.

It doesn’t matter whether they have returned to the state from Covid-19-affected country or are primary or secondary contacts of Covid-19 patients. This comes amid World Health Organisation (WHO) declaring Covid-19 a pandemic and scare of spread of the disease in the community in the state.“Testing is not going to change either the clinical course or management of the patient with mild symptoms,” said the revised guidelines for testing, quarantine, hospital admission and discharge for Covid-19 signed by principal secretary (health) Dr Rajan N Khobragade.The new revised guidelines issued on Thursday say the epidemiology of Covid-19 shows that 75% to 80% of the affected will develop only mild symptoms which do not require hospitalisation. Severe and infection and mortality are seen only in high-risk groups like elderly and those with chronic lung disease, heart disease, liver disease, renal disease, malignancies, immunocompromised, pregnancy, post-transplant, hematalogical disorders, HIV and those on chemotherapy or long-term steroids.Making it clear that the epidemiology of Covid-19, SARS and MERS clearly demonstrate that hospitals act as amplifying centres for the epidemic, the guidelines states, “This happens due to the mixing of patients with different risk categorization in the busy outpatient areas of designated Covid-19 centres”.“In majority of patients with mild symptoms, there is no need for hospitalisation or symptomatic management. Just like any viral infection, Covid-19 also will resolve by itself in majority of the patients,” the guidelines added.Health officials have already started implementing the revised guidelines from Thursday. “This will help stop the spread of the infection in the community and avoid unwanted rush at Covid-19 isolation wards. Many of the patients who arrived from Italy on Thursday and had mild or no symptoms were send to home quarantine in an ambulance,” said Dr Joseph Chacko, president, Kerala Government Medical Officers' Association (KGMOA).Further to ensure that there is no spread of Covid-19 in the local community, health officials said that it has been decided that in patients with viral pneumonia, Covid-19 testing maybe considered even if they are not from a country or area with local transmission of the corona virus and will be decided by the institution or district medical board.BOXCovid-19 has been categorised into:Category ASymptoms: Low grade fever, mild sore throat, cough, rhinitis (sneezing, stuffy nose) and diarrhoea*Patient will be assessed every 28 to 48 hours telephonically by a doctor from nearby PHC* No testing needed*No need to go to the designated Covid-19 nodal centres* Strict home isolation*Patients advised to have plenty of warm, nourishing oral fluids, balanced diet, adequate sleep and rest and saline gargle for sore throatCategory B*Symptoms: High grade fever, severe sore throat and cough*Should come to designated Covid-19 treatment centres*After clinical assessment, decision on testing to be taken*Patient to be started on symptomatic treatment* Maybe admitted at the treatment centre or sent back for home isolation* Patient will be assessed every 28 to 48 hours telephonically by a doctor from nearby PHC if send to home isolationCategory C*Symptoms: Breathlessness, chest pain, drowsiness, fall in blood pressure, cyanosis (red flag signs) etc, children with influenza like illness with red flag signs, high persistent fever with respiratory distress, worsening of underlying chronic condition*Patient will be admitted to designated Covid-19 treatment centres* Testing required#",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74601850,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-125135,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/people-with-mild-symptoms-of-covid-19-neednt-go-for-testing-or-treatment/articleshow/74601851.cms

CHENNAI: The congestion around the busy T Nagar bus terminus could soon ease. More than seven years after coming up with a proposal, the city corporation has finally started work on a skywalk, Chennai’s first, that will link the terminus with the Mambalam railway station.

One leg of the facility, aimed at providing seamless connectivity to pedestrians using multiple modes of transport like suburban trains, long-distance trains, buses and taxis or autos, will drop on South Usman road. This is part of the smart city project’s area-based development (ABD).

A barricade has been put up at the entrance of Madley Road, beside the bus terminus, where work is on, senior officials said, adding that it is estimated to cost Rs 29 crore and is scheduled to be completed in 15 months. “However, we want to ensure the work is over in 12 months,” an official said.

It will be 600 metres long, and four metres wide, allowing a considerable number of citizens to walk through it at any given time. Solar panels on top will power both the lights and a safety alarm that will be provided, an official said.

All the three exits will have escalators that would make it easier for the differently abled and senior citizens, officials involved in the project said.

The columns would be of steel, the foundation will be of cement concrete and the sheets made of polycarbonate material.

Some of the pillars would be dug into the walls of the Madley Road subway itself, not impacting the width of the service road, an official said.

A section of residents in the area had raised concerns about reduction in the width of the road. People living along the service road, and on Thukkaram 1st, 2nd and 3rd streets claimed the service road was the only entry point for emergency vehicles like ambulances and fire tenders and that the project would result in the road shutting down. “Please shift it to neighbouring Natesan Street,’ they had said in a complaint sent to the chief minister’s cell.

A senior corporation official said the width of the service road would not be reduced as the skywalk was being erected at a height of six metres. “There is nothing to worry.”

The corporation plans to remove vendors from Station Border Road before construction begins and will rehabilitate them below it after the project is over, an official said.

The issue was first highlighted by a vernacular daily in January. The NGT’s Southern Zone took suo moto cognizance of it and formed the said committee.

During initial inspection, the committee found sachets and milk packets stored in polythene bags for disposal to waste recycler.

Further inspection at Tirupati revealed that the manufacturer did not obtain permission from Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB) and operated from a small house. The unit did not pasteurise milk and simply packed cold milk in plastic packets.

On an average 1,000 packets were prepared daily and 400 litres of waste water gathered in the unit was let into nearby irrigation fields without any effluent treatment.

On enquiry, the owner of the unit admitted that they were illegally disposing of expired packets by a van driver at Kosasthalai near Kandigai in Tirutani for the past one and a half months.

APPCB issued a showcause notice and imposed an environmental compensation of Rs 1,85,000 on the unit.

NGT said APPCB should ensure that the compensation be collected without delay and take action if the unit continued to operate without government consent.

It will help them avail benefits from various central and state governments schemes. The department for the welfare of differently abled has roped in 100 medical officers from every district primary health center to facilitate this process.

“We have so far generated over one lakh ID cards and we have 3.17 applications that need to be uploaded in the portal of the ministry of social justice to get the cards,” said a senior official from the department. The official explained that they are working with the health department to clear the backlog. “There are lakhs of applications that need to be checked by medical officers and later uploaded on the portal, but we only had 17 doctors in our department to carry out this task. Hence, the health department has deputed 100 more,” the official said.

This project was launched by the Centre in 2017 to create a national database for disabled falling under all 21 categories mentioned in the Persons with Disabilities Act. It is meant to ensure transparency, help beneficiaries avail all schemes and government benefits and streamline the tracking of the physical and financial progress of beneficiaries at all levels.

Tamil Nadu currently has around 13 lakh persons with disabilities. Officials from the department said that many do not come forward to apply for the ID, hence the low number. “The ID is not made compulsory yet. That is why people do not take it seriously,” the official said. To make the application process easier the department will soon launch a mobile app where beneficiaries can upload all documents and get the ID without going to the district offices.

Deepak Nathan, head of the December 3 Movement that works for the rights of persons with disabilities, lauded the department for taking steps to generate more IDs, but said, “There is a lot of confusion about the use of this ID. People already have many documents and cards and they still don’t know how one more card will benefit them,” he said.

226,['13/03/2020'],Edu minister promises Rs72L tax relief for Bamu,"Aurangabad: State higher education minister Uday Samant has promised a relief of Rs72 lakh service tax for Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University ( Bamu ) as the university’s Osmanabad sub-centre is on an industrial land.

Samant, who visited the university on Thursday, said he would address the issue at the earliest by discussing the matter with state industries minister Subhash Desai.

“I assure that the university will not have to pay hefty tax every year and a necessary solution will be worked out soon. Once the tax exemption is received, the same money must be utilised for the students,” he said.

Earlier, Bamu vice-chancellor Pramod Yeole raised the issue of service tax levied by Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) before Samant. “The university is paying a huge sum every year to the MIDC towards service tax. While MIDC has granted tax exemption to some of private institutions set up on industrial land in the area, the state university like ours is asked to pay Rs 72 lakh every year,” he said.

Among other demands raised by Bamu, Samant said recruitment of teachers on vacant posts would be carried out shortly along with other state universities.

Samant, who visited Bamu for the first time after becoming the education minister, said his department plans to visit every district in the state to address educational issues.

“We have decided to start the initiative from Gadchiroli district. As part of the initiative, senior officials from the education department would accompany me during visits at district headquarters where day-long meetings will be held with different stakeholders to resolve the pressing issues,” the minister said.

227,['13/03/2020'],"A dozen couples tie the knot, ignore govt appeal","Nashik: Government appeals to avoid large gatherings and maintain social distance notwithstanding, at least a dozen weddings were solemnized in different parts of the city as Thursday.

There are over 40 wedding halls and lawns across the city. Though district collector Suraj Mandhare had appealed to the function halls and lawns to not allow any events, most were booked on Thursday as it was an auspicious day.

Parents of some of the brides said they had finalised the wedding months ago and had invested lakhs of rupees.

According to the sources in the wedding halls and lawns, though many weddings were scheduled on March 19, most families conducted the ceremonies a day before. A few parties deferred the ceremonies

“One group had already booked the venue two months ago. The groom had come from Aurangabad and had made all the arrangements. It was difficult for us to stop them. We had given them two hours and told them to invite as few people as possible. The party completed the wedding ceremony in the stipulated time,” said A Ahire, the owner of a marriage hall.

“We had invited 50 people from both the parties. We had taken all the measures like using sanitisers and face masks. We completed all the wedding rituals in two hours and left the hall,” said the groom’s father.

Owner of another wedding hall said that the party had spent a lot of money on the arrangements and had distributed over 1,200 wedding cards. But only 100 people turned up for the wedding.

“Moreover, we had also provided sanitizers and masks to the staff engaged in serving food to the guests,” said the owner.

R Patil, father of a bride, had planned for his daughter’s wedding around two-and-a-half months ago. He had spent over Rs 7 lakh and distributed 1,000 wedding cards. “How could I have cancelled the wedding at this point? Would the government have compensated what I had already spent?” said Patil.

The preparatory meet is usually held in February or by early March.

The officials at Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam (KMVN), the nodal agency for the yatra in Uttarakhand, said they have not received any specific information about the delay in holding the meeting, but it is believed that the reason may be the Covid-19 threat.

Notably, a large part of the almost one-month long yatra involves travelling through Tibet.

The yatra starts from the first week of June and ends in mid-September.

“We have no specific information for the delay in the meeting. But hopefully, the meeting will be held within this month,” said Ashok Joshi, manager tourist of KMVN.

“Though the preparatory meeting is yet to be held, the nagar nigam workers have already started preparation for yatra,” he added.

When asked as to what would happen if Kailash yatra gets cancelled, Joshi said, “Then we will try to increase the number of groups for Adi Kailash Yatra.”

Residents of Bhimtal, Dhari and Okhalkanda block said that the road which connects their villages was completely damaged and as a result no car or motorcycle is able to leave the area and get necessary supplies. “The road was damaged more than a fortnight ago and since then there is no connectivity. All we can do is travel on foot because most of the road has collapsed. And due to this, thousands of villagers are facing shortage of food supplies,” said Umesh Singh, a local.

Meanwhile, Bharat Sambhal of Gairakhan village said that the locals now have to take a detour of almost 35 km to get necessary supplies. “The road was built almost four years ago and it was the major route to go to places such as Kathgodam and Haldwani. Now that it has been damaged we have to travel over 35 km extra via Dhanachuli to get even basic supplies. Though it is still possible for people with vehicles, there are hundreds of villagers who do not own a vehicle and therefore they are the worst affected,” he said.

Ravinder Sambhal of the same village added that no government official has visited them yet or even given them any help. “It’s been well over two weeks since we have been left stranded here. As the entire area falls in the hills, we have to spend almost three more hours to get anything. Yet no one has come forward to help,” he said.

The officials of the district administration, meanwhile, said that they are already in the process to repair the road and since the existing structure is not stable, the PWD will have to conduct a survey and then build the road accordingly. “We have released a fund of around Rs 2.5 lakh for the preliminary survey to the PWD. The gravel under the road is loose and that’s why it is not able to hold the weight. We are planning a permanent solution. After the survey, a detailed project report (DPR) will be finalised which will be sent to the government for release of money. The entire project will cost around Rs 1.5 crore to Rs 2 crore,” said Nainital district magistrate Savin Bansal.

The suspension was effected by Andhra Pradesh and even before the Central Administrative Tribunal could determine the validity of this suspension, the Centre approved the action taken by Andhra Pradesh. The Centre also asked the state to file chargesheet against the suspended IPS officer for his alleged efforts to secure a drones procurement contract to an Israeli firm in contravention to the norms.

Now, Andhra Pradesh is asking the Central Administrative Tribunal to take the Centre’s decision into consideration because it agreed with the state’s conclusion that Rao’s actions constitute to misconduct.

Rao, in his plea, said the Centre’s decision came after CAT reserved its judgment and hence the matter should be adjudicated without looking at the Centre’s decision or its rationale. The case will come up for hearing at the tribunal on Monday.

234,['13/03/2020'],"From stands to the middle, Thapa sees it all","Panaji: When Chennaiyin FC won their maiden Indian Super League ( ISL ) title in 2015, Anirudh Thapa was keenly watching from the stands of the Nehru Stadium at Fatorda. Even though FC Goa lost their grip on home soil after late drama in the 2-3 thriller, Thapa, who was with the AIFF Academy that time, was cheering for the visitors, thanks to friends at the club.

Next season, Thapa joined the club in a ‘dream move’ and made his debut at the same venue, a high-scoring and entertaining 4-5 loss. He had a role to play in Chennaiyin’s second triumph, but as the two-time champions prepare to face ATK in another final on Saturday, the midfielder should feel the weight on his shoulders.

“When I began, I wasn’t so experienced and never knew how far I would come because that time there were many players and I was happy playing alongside them and learning. Now, this is my fourth season and I’m doing well, but there is more to come,” Thapa told TOI on Thursday.

Chennaiyin were languishing at the bottom of the table in December and their rise to play-off qualification only began when Owen Coyle took over the reins from John Gregory in December. Since then, they have only improved in their last 14 matches under the Scottish coach which helped them secure a play-off berth. In the first leg semifinal at home, Thapa, 22, scored his only goal so far, but an important one in a 4-1 demolition of league toppers FC Goa. In the return leg they held on for a 2-4 loss and enter their third final.

“We knew Goa plays different kind of football and everyone was expecting them to qualify. We had the advantage when two of their main players were not playing and we scored as many goals in the first leg. We knew when we come to Goa, we can play our game because they will be under pressure,” said Thapa.

The international has the highest assists (6) for an Indian and has been the heartbeat of the side that doesn’t use any foreigners in midfield. He played 19 matches, missing only once against Bengaluru FC, when they failed to score. He has formed a strong partnership alongside former Minerva Punjab teammate Germanpreet Singh and, at times, Edwin Vanspaul.

Chennaiyin had lost by a solitary goal to ATK at home in the first leg but responded strongly in the return leg with a 3-1 victory in Kolkata. However, Thapa believes past records will count for nothing in the final.

“This season we were at the bottom and six matches without a win. Then the last eight matches we had to win, and we were playing under pressure in every match. It will be amazing to win and lift the title here,” said Thapa.

ATK and Chennaiyin are the most successful clubs in the history of ISL and share four titles between them, winning two each. Thapa already has one and now wants to see Chennaiyin win another one, this time not watching from the stands, but running the show in the middle at Fatorda.

SECUNDERABAD: In order to ease traffic congestion here, the GHMC has decided to improve two junctions. The proposal for the project will be placed before a standing committee on March 19.

“The proposal will be approved,” said a GHMC official. The junction opposite International Society for Krishna Consciousness, popularly known as Maredpally junction, and Sangeet junction are set to be improved.

As many as 10 properties will have to be acquired for the junction improvement. For every one square yard of land acquired, the GHMC has decided to give property owners nine square feet of built space. The move is aimed towards saving funds as no monetary compensation will be provided.

“If we acquire 100 square yards of land we are giving the property owners 900 square feet of built up space as compensation,” said GHMC Director (Planning) K Srinivasa Rao.

The offer is different for Transferable Development Rights(TDR) certificate. “In case of TDR, we will give property owners four times built of up area. As of today, the estimate to improve the two junctions has come up to Rs 12 crore,” said Rao.

As per GHMC records, the maximum proportion of the expense if going to land acquisition, which is summing up to Rs 10 crore. Widening of roads, installation of circular junction boxes and beautification work are a part of the project. GHMC standing committee on Thursday approved the proposal to widen the road from Methodist Colony and Begumpet to Begumpet Railyway Station (parallel to railway track). The road falls under GHMC Secunderabad zone.

Once the two junctions are improved and the road is widened, traffic congestion at Sangeet junction, Mettuguda and traffic from Secunderabad to Begumpet will be reduced. After improving the two junctions, GHMC has also proposed to develop the Begumpet junction. But a central government building needs to be acquired to execute the junction improvement in that area.

NAINITAL: The Tibetan community in Nainital on Thursday protested the Chinese annexation of Tibet on March 12, 1959, when the Chinese bombed Lhasa and killed thousands of Tibetans.

The day also marks the anniversary of the Tibetan women’s protest against the Chinese.

The protesters also prayed to the Dalai Lama and alleged that “the Chinese troops will never be able to win the hearts of the people and that the region will be free one day.” The national general secretary of the women’s wing of Indo-Tibetan Cooperation Forum, Preeti Saagar , also visited Nainital to lend her support to the protest.

She said, “Several women had resisted the Chinese aggression in Tibet in 1959. Since then, the Tibetans living at several locations across the country have been organising protests on this day. The silent protest in Nainital is also a part of that and therefore people have gathered here to protest the Chinese occupation of Tibet.”

The Tibetan and Bhotia markets of Nainital also remained closed on Thursday to pay respect to the martyrs. The Tibetan community condemned the occupation and also demanded the United Nations (UN) to initiate talks between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama.

“The UN should take note of the human rights violations in Tibet and also work to grant religious freedom which has been severely curtailed under the Chinese. Steps should also be taken to initiate talks between His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the Chinese government,” the protesters said.

Meanwhile, as soon as the weather cleared, the administration started road repair work.

Sources said that traffic movement at Gangotri and Yamunotri national highways got interrupted at Sukki Top and Hanumanchatti regions late on Wednesday, due to fresh spell of snowfall.

Meanwhile, the national highway authority restored traffic movement on Yamunotri highway on Thursday after the weather cleared. Besides, Border Roads Organisation (BRO) also restored traffic movement on Gangotri highway from Sukki Top to Dharali village. However, the highway was still blocked ahead of Dharali village.

BHOPAL: The state Congress on Thursday alleged that two ministers of the Kamal Nath government were assaulted and arrested by Bangalore police when they went to the resort where 19 MLAs have been lodged, allegedly by BJP. Congress may move Supreme Court since it has become an “inter-state and even national issue”.

With the clock ticking down to the arrival of Jyotiraditya Scindia in Bhopal, senior Congress leaders Digvijaya Singh and Vivek Tankha held a press meet where they showed dramatic videos of ministers Jitu Patwari and Lakhan Singh Yadav being shoved around in Bengaluru.

The two ministers had gone to the resort along with Narayan Choudhary, father of MLA Manoj Choudhary who is one of the 19 legislators cooped up in the resort. Patwari is a relative of Manoj Choudhary. Digvijaya and Tankha showed videos of how Patwari, Lakhan and Narayan Choudhary were allegedly manhandled by police, bodily lifted into a police bus and taken away. Choudhary is seen in the videos in a pair of swimming shorts and with a towel around his neck.

“This is a case of abduction and forced captivity,” Tankha, an eminent lawyer, said. “You abduct and take our MLAs to a different region, and hold them hostage. They cannot even contact their families as their mobile phones have been taken away. They are not there out of free will. A BJP delegation, led by senior leaders takes resignations from MLAs on Holi and returns to Bhopal to submit them to the Speaker. No one knows under what circumstances these resignations were taken from our MLAs,” Tankha said.

Tankha alleged that the ministers were assaulted and arrested. “After speaking to his father, Manoj wanted to return. To release people held captive is the duty of every citizen. Our ministers were trying to do what police should have done. They were assaulted and arrested because a father wanted to bring his son home. This is condemnable,” he argued.

“We demand that Bangalore police immediately take punitive action against those officers, and release our ministers and MLAs. Otherwise, we may have to move Supreme Court. We could have gone to high court but this is an issue between two states. This has become a national issue now — how MLAs from Madhya Pradesh have been abducted, held captive, are being pressurized and their relatives being beaten,” Tankha said.

“We are consulting Kapil Sibal (former Union minister and Supreme Court lawyer) and, maybe, will move Supreme Court and tell how the country’s democracy is in danger. What BJP is doing is a criminal act and an unbiased probe should be conducted by the apex court because BJP-led Centre will not be interested,” he said.

Regarding the resignations of 22 Congress MLAs submitted by former BJP minister Bhupendra Singh to Speaker NP Prajapati on March 10, Tankha said, “Under Constitution and the law, a Speaker, whether of Congress or BJP, has only one option — to investigate these resignations. Notices have been sent so that the MLAs may present themselves and discuss with the Speaker. Two years ago, when Jagan Mohan Reddy’s MPs faced a similar situation, then Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan conducted an inquiry for two months.”

Speaker NP Prajapati issued notices to six ministers on Wednesday. Prajapati said seven MLAs have been issued notices on Thursday.

BHOPAL: Suggestions and complaints are coming thick and fast after the administration sought residents’ advice on the high-tech masterplan draft. The advanced technology and data mapping help users take a closer view of the digital plan, consequently leading them to share their suggestions.

After the much-awaited Draft Bhopal development plan 2031 was released post 25 year-gap, the administration had invited feedback till April 4.

“Offline or manual comments regarding the master plan are being received. However, more people are responding online. Also, there is a detailed description to opt for online comment,” said a senior district administration official.

Built with extensive GPS technology, the plan can view even 0.5 sq meter of detail. Each khasra has been highlighted after development work was undertaken by Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) GPS wing. It took the department over three years. Each of 4 lakh plus properties can be viewed in two dimension on the map.

The website mptownplan.gov.in received thousands of hits, after the draft plan for Bhopal’s future development was released on March 5. It may take the authorities 60 days to submit the final document gazette.

Few objections related to permitting development in eco-sesitive zones.

The urban development officials claim that this is first development plan in India based on extensive GPS technology.

The plan allows for revenue generation through premium FAR and saving through TDR generation. New plan would enhance mixed use development in areas like MP Nagar, New Market, Karond and Misrod. A heritage and green cover conservation has also been proposed.

Last Bhopal masterplan of 1995 was valid till 2005. The city development plant is also based on transit oriented development (TOD), whereby areas along BRTS, Metro rail development would benefit from additional Floor Area Ratio (FAR).

243,['13/03/2020'],Tamil Nadu: 12th century idols dumped in pit at hilltop temple near Madurai,"A ruined idol dumped with garbage at the temple

CHENNAI: Ancient sculptures of Lord Vinayaka and Nandi have been abandoned in a dump yard near a temple atop Siddharmalai in Madurai district . The ruined sculptures, according to heritage experts, date to late 12th century AD.

Maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the site is known for its ancient Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions and Jain beds inside the cavern.

The Pandya Siva temple atop the hill in Nilakkottai village, 40km from Madurai, is maintained by a committee formed by people from nearby villages. The temple attracts devotees from neighbouring hamlets. “But the committee has not given importance to these ancient sculptures. They don’t know their value. The sculptures have been lying abandoned for a long time,” said Madurai-based heritage activist K Rajkumar.

The sculptures of Nandi with a ruined nose and Vinayaka without a trunk lie in a pit where garbage from the temple is dumped . When Rajkumar informed the committee members, one member told him, “They are broken, why do we need them. We should now think about the ideal colours with which to paint the temple.” He was referring to the recent temple renovation being carried out without expert advice.

ASI: Not aware, will look into it

TN archaeology department deputy director R Sivanandam said, “We are not aware of this. We will look into the matter and take appropriate action to preserve the sculptures found abandoned on the premises of the temple.”

The Pandya-era temple was renovated during the Nayak period, but use of paint during the restoration a couple of years ago destroyed the ancient Tamil inscriptions at the base. “The temple looks like a modern structure today. Many ancient Tamil inscriptions have been lost and those at the base have been covered with a thick coat of paint. The committee seems clueless about the value of inscriptions and sculptures,” said retired history professor M M Bhoopathi. Trekking to the top of Siddharmalai is an arduous 40-minute climb before the cavern containing Jain beds and Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions is reached. The Siva temple is perched on top of the hill with a breathtaking view of the Vaigai. The ASI has done little to prevent vandalism.

The three-month courses are being introduced by Samarpan Sanstha, School of Environment — a Jalgaon-based NGO — and the university is the affiliation body for the courses.

The courses will run under the university’s Department of Lifelong Learning and Extension. Director of the department Manish Joshi said distinctive courses would benefit students who are interested in learning various aspects of wildlife.

“We will be the affiliation body for courses while the syllabus designing and other required process will be carried out by the NGO. They had asked us to begin these courses in collaboration and the university has decided to be part of it,” he said.

The three certificate courses are Ornithology (Bird Science), Biodiversity and Forest and Wildlife. Anyone who has completed his higher secondary education will be eligible to join the courses.

Rajendra Nannaware, chairman of Samarpan Sanstha, said, “There are various wildlife activists and academicians who need to learn a systematic syllabus. We decided to come up with a conceptual course which would help them in learning about the environment.”

The syllabus will be designed by the NGO and the study material will be provided by them. “The designing of syllabus and study material is under process. We have formed an academic council of 10 experts from the field,” Nannaware said.

“The certificate courses can be learnt through distance learning programme as well. The students will be provided the study material but they will have to complete the field work and assignments given by the experts,” said Nannaware.

246,['13/03/2020'],Scindia won’t get respect or satisfaction in BJP: Rahul,"Senior Congress leader Vivek Tankha meets Digvijaya Singh after he filed his RS nomination papers. Arun Yadav ... Read More

New Delhi: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi Thursday said that Jyotiraditya Scindia abandoned his ideology and went with the RSS out of concern for his political future, warning him that he would not neither get respect nor satisfaction in the BJP.

Breaking his silence on the Gwalior royal’s decision to leave the Congress, Rahul Gandhi told reporters, “Scindia became apprehensive about his political future, he abandoned his ideology and went with the RSS. But the reality is that he will neither get respect nor satisfaction there (in BJP) given what he has in his heart. He will understand.”

In what appeared a reaction to Scindia’s comments in praise of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP, and his criticism of Congress, Gandhi said, “Ours is an old friendship. What is in his heart and what he is saying are two different things.”

Stressing the difference between Scindia’s old and new political shelter, Rahul said, “This is an ideological fight with Congress on one side and RSS-BJP on the other. I know Scindia’s ideology, he was with me in college.”

The remarks came a day after Rahul Gandhi offered a nuanced reaction to Scindia’s rebellion by retweeting a picture he had posted after Kamal Nath was named the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh in December 2018.

Flanked by Scindia and Nath, Rahul had captioned the picture by stressing the importance of “patience and time being the greatest warriors”. Rahul’s comment that Scindia became “apprehensive” about his political future alludes to his rivalry with Nath and Digvijaya Singh, who came to be seen as the ruling faction of Madhya Pradesh Congress after Nath became the CM. However, in the wake of Scindia’s exit, the Gandhi scion is finding it hard to quell the queries that members of his “team” are facing trouble at the hands of the “old guard”.

While he appeared before the press to criticise Modi government over its response to economic crisis and coronavirus, he was miffed at repeated questions about post-Scindia rumblings, the latest being over Rajya Sabha nominations being denied to people “of his team”.

248,['13/03/2020'],Act on fee data: Parents to Telangana government,"Representative Image

HYDERABAD: A day after the Telangana high court set a 28 day deadline for the state government to formulate a comprehensive policy for school fee regulation, parents in the city have questioned the school education department’s inaction on school data that was collected in 2018.

Following the constitution of Tirupathi Rao committee, the department sought audited account statements of all the schools for the academic years 2016-17 and 2017-18. The commissioner of school education had launched a website for the same, where out of the 12,000 schools in the city, close to 4,500 had submitted their data until June 2018.

Parents claim that while the activity was primarily conducted to formulate a policy and examine the fee issue, the school department has been ineffective for the past two years.

“For a long time, the government’s argument was that they do not have sufficient data to regulate school fees . Now that they have collected the data, they have neither informed us about the range of fees collected by schools nor have they regulated it,” said Pawan Kumar, executive member of Hyderabad School Parents Association.

As per the committee recommendations, the data was expected to help the department decide the modalities on fixing the fee hike issue, including a cut-off on percentage of hike based on the annual pay revision. However, due to government’s failure in taking a decision, the data has been gathering dust with the school education department.

With the HC intervening in the hike issue, parents have demanded the government to ensure that the data is put to use. “With the new academic session set to commence, the government should now take note of this data and form a comprehensive policy to regulate the fee structure,” said Vedika Chunduri, a parent.

Sources in the school education department claim that majority schools that had submitted their financial records were budget schools with fees in the range of Rs 1,500 to Rs 35,000. There were barely few schools who levy between Rs 35,000 to Rs 1.50 lakh annual fee.

Previously, an NGO working for road safety had written a letter to the traffic police demanding that the tests be stopped.Since mid-January, the coronavirus argument has been used time and again by motorists to evade the tests.

While Shiv Sena has been the only party to celebrate the day as per the Hindu calendar, the MNS has joined in with an eye on the Hindu votebank.

The MNS chief, who was in town on the occasion amid grand arrangements, said, “For us, Shiv Jayanti is a festival.

As a token of respect, we will celebrate the day as per the Hindu calendar only as it is a festival for us.”

Thackeray, while addressing a gathering after paying tribute to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj at Kranti Chowk, did not make a direct attack on Shiv Sena but raised the Hindutva pitch after the saffron party joined hands with Congress and NCP to form Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state.

While the event took place amid caution against public gathering in the wake of coronavirus outbreak, Thackeray appealed to the revellers to take precautionary measures. “We already have so many diseases and now there is an addition to it.

DEHRADUN: Former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat who has been deputed by the Congress to help Kamal Nath save his government, says he is offering advice based on “my own experience of handling a similar situation engineered by BJP in Uttarakhand in 2016.”

The former CM had faced a revolt from a section of his MLAs in 2016, who had subsequently joined the BJP. With the Congress government short of majority, central rule was imposed in the state but Rawat was later able to prove his majority in the House and save his government. In view of his experience in dealing with the crisis, Rawat along with AICC general secretary Mukul Wasnik has been deputed by the party to help in the MP situation.

Rawat who was in Jaipur on Thursday told TOI that “90-plus Congress MLAs are in Jaipur and contact has been made with 14 other MLAs, who have been held captive at Bengaluru.” Exuding confidence that these 14 Congress MLAs were willing to return to the party fold, Rawat said, “I am confident that we will prove our majority in MP. As far as Scindia ji is concerned, he held prominent positions for a large part of his political career but it was the need for power, which took him to BJP.”

He added that the situation was different when Scindia was in Congress as he had some MLAs in his camp. “After he quit the party, his followers do not want to do so, but still they are being forcefully kept at Bengaluru. It is surprising that the PM himself is negotiating these things,” he said.

He alleged that on Thursday, the father of a Congress MLA went to Bengaluru to meet his son, but he was also detained at a police station. “What kind of democracy is this where a father cannot meet his son and bring him back?”

Attacking the BJP for creating political instability, Rawat said, “There is a sense of political uneasiness in the states because of the Narendra Modi government. They have created similar situations earlier in Assam, Uttarakhand and Goa and now are doing it in MP.” He claimed that the BJP’s top leadership was “unable to digest anything which is against them, even the peoples’ mandate.” “Whether it is through Vijay Bahuguna in Uttarakhand or Jyotiraditya Scindia in Madhya Pradesh , the BJP is quick to pounce on the situation and aggressively act against any state government which is of another political outfit.”

RAIPUR: Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Thursday took a dig at Jyotiraditya Scindia for joining the BJP, saying, this proved that he cannot live without power .

“After having lost the elections, Scindia was apparently feeling like fish out of water,” he quipped on his return from New Delhi after having discussion with party high command regarding party candidates for Rajya Sabha polls from Chhattisgarh.

“We in Congress always considered Scindia as a great man. But in a crisis time, he preferred to join the BJP and that sums up about his personality”, the chief minister said.

Meanwhile, Chhattisgarh panchayat and rural development minister T S Singh Deo said the people will have to teach a lesson to politicians who defect — irrespective of their party affiliations. He said Scindia had always opposed and publicly criticised the ideology of BJP, but suddenly he began singing praise of the BJP, which he has been critical for long.

Criticising the BJP for being desperate to grab power and topple governments in non-BJP ruled states, the minister asked “What kind of greed is this? Do they want to stick to power for the next 1,000 years? Such actions are not good for democracy,” he added.

BAREILLY: Nearly 200 people turned up at the district hospital’s out-patient department (OPD) on Wednesday for anti-rabies vaccination (ARV). Officials said scores of people are coming to the district hospital in Bareilly for ARV as there is shortage of vaccine at a few community health centres (CHCs) in the district and other hospitals in Bareilly division .

Chief medical superintendent Dr TS Arya said, “Nearly 200-250 patients are turning up daily at the district hospital for ARV. The number of patients has gone up in the past few days as ARV is unavailable at CHCs and a few other hospitals. Patients are also coming from neighbouring districts, including Budaun, Pilibhit and Shahjahanpur .”

Chief medical officer Dr Vineet Shukla said, “The stock of ARV is over at a few CHCs and we have raised demand from UP medical corporation which will supply it in a few days. As ARV is unavailable at a few CHCs, patients are going directly to the district hospital.”

According to the officials, the vaccine – expensive in the open market – is administered free of cost at the CHCs and government hospitals. It is mandatory to be given anti-rabies shots within 24 hours of being bitten by an animal, mostly dogs and monkeys. It is fatal if a human being who contracts rabies is not treated immediately. At least three to six shots are required per patient, which need to be given on 3rd day after the first shot and later on 7th, 14th, 30th and 90th days.

TOI had earlier reported that a report by the state health department has revealed that 1,855 cases of dog bite, 166 cases of monkey bite, 27 cases of cat bite, 2 cases of horse bite and 1 case of crocodile bite have been reported at Bareilly district hospital in January alone. The report further stated that a person died due to rabies in the same period. Officials said the actual number in the district is likely to be higher.

258,['13/03/2020'],Scindia scion begins with a bang in Bhopal,"File photo of Jyotiraditya Scindia

BHOPAL: Jyotiraditya Scindia was given a royal welcome on his arrival at Bhopal for his first road show as a BJP leader. It took him almost 45 minutes to cover just 500metres from the airport to the main road, part of which he had to walk because it became impossible to keep his SUV crawling through the crowd.

Supporters lined up to cheer him along nearly the entire route to the BJP HQ.

Bhopal airport was jam-packed with Scindia supporters hours before he was scheduled to land with senior BJP leader and Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar .

State BJP president V D Sharma, senior BJP leader Narottam Mishra and around 5,000 supporters from different corners of the state waited for him at the airport.

Scindia came out of airport at 4.45pm, 45 minutes beyond the scheduled time. Immediately, the crowd surged forward, cheering for ‘Maharaj’. They made it clear they were Scindia supporters and would follow him anywhere, be it Congress or BJP — or as minister Imarti Devi had said on Wednesday, “even into a well”. “Hum kal bhi aapke the, aaj bhi hai, aur kal bhi rahenge,” read placards held up by the cheering crowd.

Scindia was supposed to move through Bhopal in the form of rally, but very quickly it became clear that it would be impossible. Supporters jostled for a glimpse of the Gwalior scion and did not allow the vehicle to move. Scindia sat in the SUV with his aunt, former BJP minister Yashodhara Raje Scindia , VD Sharma and BJP spokesperson Zafar Islam.

Scindia then climbed atop the SUV to keep it moving but the crowd just kept coming. The BJP leader, too, reached out to them, urging people to throw garlands if they couldn’t reach him.

Finally, Scindia stepped out of the vehicle and walked along with his supporters. With his supporters forming a human chain, Scindia moved on foot for about 500m to the main road.

Supporters of the breakaway MLAs of the Scindia faction, now in Bengaluru, also came to the airport to show their support for Shrimant, as he is addressed by supporters. Former BJP minister who joined Congress in 2018 state polls Sartaj Singh also came to greet Scindia at airport, apart from scores of BJP leaders and Scindia supporters.

There were saffron flags and drumbeats at the airport, but that show was purely of Scindia supporters.

Scindia was the man of the moment. He posed for selfies, hugged supporters and did not mind getting jostled in the crowd. It took an hour for him just to move out of the airport premises.

His supporters and BJP workers were on streets to welcome him while his convoy moved towards BJP headquarters. Scindia stopped his cavalcade nine times on the 20km drive. Scindia’s cavalcade was over a kilometre long, mostly comprising youths. Police were deployed in strength all along the route. In the morning, a few posters of Scindia put up by BJP had been blackened by unknown miscreants. Police were taking no chances.

Cops deployed at the airport had a tough time controlling the crowd. He reached state BJP headquarters at 6.40pm.

259,['13/03/2020'],HC reserves order on allotting land to the poor from other places in capital,"Vijayawada: The high court on Thursday reserved orders in a batch of petitions challenging the allocation of house sites to landless poor from other places in the capital city area.

While the petitioners argued that the allocation of house sites to people from Vijayawada, Mangalagiri, Tadepalli and other villages is illegal and in violation of Capital Region Development Authority ( CRDA ) Act, the state government argued that there is no prohibition on allotting lands to the poor according to the Act.

Arguing on behalf of the petitioners, former advocate general Dammalapati Srinivas contended that the five per cent land reserved from the total extent of land taken under Land Pooling Scheme (LPS) is for future use. It was to provide affordable housing to the poor people who will migrate to the capital over a period of time, but the state government is trying allocate the land at one go that is against the spirit of the CRDA Act.

Senior counsel Ashok Bhan argued that GO 107 issued to allot lands to the poor in capital city area is illegal and ultra vires as it not only violates the CRDA Act but also defeats the purpose of LPS under which the farmers had given their lands for the construction of the capital city. Moreover, the five per cent land reserved is for the purpose of providing housing to the poor people residing in the capital city area and not those from other areas. He further said if the state government wants to allot lands to the people, it can do so outside the capital city area.

One of the petitioner’s counsel Karumanchi Indraneel Babu observed that the definition of poor people mentioned in CRDA Act should be interpreted with the LPS and cannot be seen in isolation. The state government cannot allot lands to people from other areas as the definition of poor has to be interpreted as it was done in case of land owners in the capital city area. He further said that the zonal regulations prescribed in CRDA Act do not allow to provide house sites not less than 100 sq metres.

Arguing on behalf of the state government, advocate general S Sriram said there is no prohibition in CRDA Act that bars the government from allotting lands to poor people from other places. The decision was taken after a series of consultation by Krishna and Guntur collectors as there was no land available to allot in the urban areas, they requested the government for other suitable land.

Upon hearing all sides, the high court bench headed by Chief Justice J K Maheswari, Justice A V Sesha Sai and Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy reserved their order.

260,['13/03/2020'],"High drama in Bengaluru, Jitu arrested on ‘rescue mission’","A video grab of minister Jitu Patwari being arrested by Bengaluru cops.

BENGALURU/BHOPAL: A Congress operation to ‘rescue’ the MLAs it claims are being held ‘hostage’ by BJP at a resort in Bengaluru led to high drama as minister Jitu Patwari was arrested, following a scuffle, when he tried to enter the resort.

In Bhopal, senior Congress leaders Digvijaya Singh and Vivek Tankha held a press meet to show dramatic videos of Jitu being “shoved around” and led into a police bus, and condemned the police action. Tankha said Congress could move Supreme Court as it was now an “inter-state, even national issue”.

Patwari and minister Lakhan Singh had gone to the resort along with Narayan Choudhary, father of MLA Manoj Choudhary who is one of the 19 legislators cooped up in the resort. Patwari is a relative of Manoj. Digvijaya and Tankha showed videos of how Patwari, Lakhan and Narayan Choudhary were allegedly manhandled by police, bodily lifted into a police bus and taken away. Choudhary is seen in the videos in a pair of swimming shorts and with a towel around his neck.

“This is a case of abduction and forced captivity,” Tankha, an eminent lawyer, said. “You abduct and take our MLAs to a different region, and hold them hostage. They cannot even contact their families as their mobile phones have been taken away. They are not there out of free will. A BJP delegation, led by senior leaders takes resignations from MLAs on Holi and returns to Bhopal to submit them to the Speaker. No one knows under what circumstances these resignations were taken from our MLAs,” he said.

In a video of the incident, which was widely shared, Patwari is seen trying to enter the resort, while policemen are preventing him. It also shows the minister in a heated argument with police.

Karnataka Congress condemned the police action and demanded an apology from chief minister BS Yediyurappa. “Karnataka police’s act of arresting a Madhya Pradesh minister, who had come to convince the Congress legislators who are in Bengaluru, is condemnable. Goonda behaviour of Karnataka BJP government is not right, they should be released immediately, and chief minister BS Yediyurappa has to apologise for the mistake,” state Congress tweeted.

Nineteen legislators, loyalists of Jyotiraditya Scindia, in a letter to Karnataka DGP and IG had said they had come to Karnataka “voluntarily” on “important work”. All 19 had tendered their resignations on Tuesday, pushing the Kamal Nath-led Congress government in MP into a crisis.

Bengaluru police commissioner Bhaskar Rao told TOI that his force arrested Patwari under IPC 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharging duty).

“The MLAs from MP had given a written requisition saying some politicians from their home state were flying down to meet them and they don’t want to meet anyone. So we set up a police force outside the place. Jitu Patwari not only tried to enter forcibly, but also manhandled police trying to stop him,” Rao said.

Later in the evening, Patwari and newly appointed KPCC president DK Shivakumar held a press briefing, accusing city police of acting on behalf of the ruling party and not even allowing family members meet “kidnapped” legislators from MP.

“It is possible that a few people are trying to put psychological pressure by putting forth the image of Jyotiraditya Scindia. But why are you (MLAs) trying to sacrifice the people’s mandate? I urge my family of Congress legislators to not fall into this trap of the BJP,” said Patwari.

Patwari said they were there only to meet the legislators and not to take them back. “How can two of us forcefully take them back?” he asked, alleging that police were being used by BJP to “unlawfully confine Congress legislators”.

Shivakumar, said he was not involved “in any way” with the MP crisis and was only helping his “friends, leaders and colleagues” from the Congress.

Promotion followed by a transfer is the norm, but in Telangana it went for a toss. For instance, an additional director-general of police-rank officer should report to director-general of police (DGP), but now reports to another Additional DG-rank officer.The last major reshuffle of IPS officers took place exactly two years ago. The state government transferred and gave new postings to 38 IPS officers, including incumbent commissioners of Hyderabad and Cyberabad on March 11, 2018. Subsequently, several officers had been promoted, but they were retained in their current posts despite some posts remaining vacant due to superannuation or central deputations.In April, 2019, the government had promoted 23 IPS officers of the 2004 & 2005 batches. IPS officers S Chandrasekhar Reddy, SP of Sangareddy, AR Srinivas, DCP West Zone, and V Shiva Kumar, SP Intelligence, VB Kamalasan Reddy, commissioner of Karimnagar, Avinash Mohanty, DCP of CCS, Hyderabad, P Viswa Prasad, DCP, Central Zone, and M Ramesh, DCP, East Zone, were promoted as deputy inspectors-general (DIGs) of police and retained in their postings.After their promotion and in the rank of DIG, some of them were working as Joint CPs in Hyderabad commissionerate holding in-charge DCP posts. Similarly, the 2001 batch IPS officers G Sudheer Babu, Rachakonda joint commissioner, P Pramod Kumar, Karimnagar, DIG, T Prabhakar Rao, DIG, Intelligence, Akun Sabharwal, Civil supplies commissioner and director of enforcement (P&E), were promoted to the rank of inspector general (IG) of police. Sudheer Babu was posted as additional commissioner in Rachakonda commissionerate, where the CP too is an IG-rank officer. Pramod Kumar has been posted as IG of CID and he is also holding additional charge of DIG Karimanagr. Prabhakar Rao has been retained in intelligence as an IG. After Akun Sabharwal went on central deputation, the posts he was holding were filled with IAS and retired IAS officers.After the superannuation of two IGs, who were working as Additional CP, Admin, and CAR, in August 2019, Additional CP, Crime, Shikha Goel and Additional CP (L&O) DS Chauhan were holding additional charge of these posts. Shikha Goel of the 1994 batch has been promoted to the rank of Additional DG in April 2019, but she still continues to work as additional CP in the Hyderabad commissionerate.Though several officers of 1994, 2001, 2004 and 2005 batches were still waiting for new postings, the government recently empanelled nine IPS officers of the 2002 and 2006 batches for promotion to IG and DIG ranks.“Initially, festivals like Ganesh Chaturthi and then a series of elections forced the government to stall them. Now, the assembly is in session. Hopefully, the new postings that match our ranks will be given after the budget session. Otherwise, Ram Navami and Hanuman Jayanthi bandobust duties might become priority,” an IPS officer said. After DCP, South Zone, Ambar Kishor Jha went on central deputation, the post is being held by in-charge officers, already burdened with work from their assigned posts. Ramagundam commissioner V Satyanarayana is the in-charge DCP, South Zone.

But, as the novel coronavirus scare grew, all four surgeries got cancelled.“Some patients were upfront in stating their scare of getting infected in the hospital while the others requested for postponing the surgery on some pretext or other,” Dr Sharma, a senior orthopaedic and joint replacement surgeon, told TOI.A doctor at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH) said people were hesitant to come to Delhi for planned surgeries or follow-ups as they had heard about the viral cases in the city. “Last month, too, many patients postponed routine surgeries and follow-ups due to the riots. Now people don’t want to travel due to the novel coronavirus scare,” said Dr Amrendra Pathak, a senior urologist.Dr Yash Gulati, consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Apollo Hospital, also said he had seen a nearly 20% decline in the OPD footfall. “People are mostly scared of air travel,” he added.Cataract and gallbladder removal, and weight loss and cosmetic surgeries have been affected the most by the scare. Dr Sunil Choudhary, chief of Max Institute of Reconstructive, Aesthetic, Cleft and Craniofacial Surgery, said the demand for planned cosmetic surgeries such as rhinoplasty, commonly known as nose job, had gone down by nearly a half. “I think it is okay. Right now, our focus should be on containing the outbreak and for that people should avoid travelling for surgeries that can be postponed. But they shouldn’t neglect ill health or delay important surgeries,” he said.Big corporate hospitals are screening patients at their entrance for any symptom of the virus. They are also providing hand sanitisers at the entrance. But the fear remains. “I used to see at least 50 patients daily. But it has dipped by nearly 40% over the past two-three days,” said Dr Anoop Misra, chairman of Fortis C-Doc.Even AIIMS isn’t spared. Dr A K Bisoi, senior cardio thoracic and vascular surgeon, said there was a 30-40% fall in the follow-up cases. “Surgeries haven’t gone down here but we have come up with measures to ensure there is no crowding.

Extra precaution is also being taken to implement hand hygiene and other safety measures,” he said.While routine surgeries and follow-up for chronic conditions can be postponed, many people with emergency may still need to go to the hospital.

HYDERABAD: A 30-year-old man was arrested by Narayanguda police on Thursday for raping a nine-month-old calf at a cattle shed in Avanti Nagar, Hyderguda.

The incident took place on Wednesday night, but came to light the next day after police registered a case against the man, identified as Mahesh.

“I caught Mahesh committing the crime and immediately informed the police as well as People For Animals (PFA) and Greater Hyderabad Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (GHSPCA). This is not the first time that such an incident has occurred in this cattle shed. This has been happening for over a year now. We tried contacting the shed owners, but in vain,” an eyewitness told TOI.

The Narayanaguda police booked Mahesh under Section 377 (unnatural offences) of IPC and sent the calf to a veterinary hospital for examination. The accused has also been taken to Gandhi Hospital for a potency test.

“We have initiated investigation into the case and are trying to contact the owners of the cattle shed. We can produce the accused in court and seek custody only after we receive the reports from the hospitals,” said sub-inspector Narayana.

BHOPAL: Amid political turmoil in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP will press for a floor test on March 16, the inaugural day of the state’s budget session. The move comes in the wake of 22 Congress MLAs, siding with Jyotiraditya Scindia and resigning from the assembly, leaving the incumbent Kamal Nath-led Congress government in deep crisis.

“The Congress government is in minority. We are going to request the Governor and the assembly Speaker for a floor test on March 16 when the state budget session begins,” said BJP’s chief whip in the state assembly, Narottam Mishra , on Thursday.

Mishra said the Governor and the Speaker have the resignations of 22 MLAs. Now it is up to them to take a call. “The floor test should be conducted ahead of Governor’s address as, the state government for whom Governor will address the House has been rendered into a minority with the recent crisis. The Kamal Nath-led MP government must prove its numbers before the budget session begins on March 16,” he asserted. Mishra also challenged Congress leader Digvijaya Singh to prove majority in House and claimed that the BJP will successfully form a government in eight to 10 days.

Former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, “We have nothing to do with the internal crisis in the Congress. But, the Kamal Nath government has lost the majority and it should resign. I had also quit the government in 2018 when my party couldn’t garner support of seven MLAs.” BJP leader Bhupendra Singh , who handed over the resignations of 22 Congress MLAs also called on Speaker NP Prajapati and urged him to take early decision on the same. “MP government has reduced to a minority, CM Kamal Nath should immediately quit the post,” he said

On Thursday, Governor Lalji Tandon also arrived in the state capital from his vacation.

Meanwhile, Speaker NP Prajapati has served notice to 13 MLAs seeking clarification on their resignations. “I have given notice to seven MLAs on Wednesday and six MLAs on Thursday seeking verification on their resignations. I have asked them whether they have personally and willingly tendered resignations or under duress. I am bound by the rules and work as per the established procedure,” said Prajapati.

267,['13/03/2020'],"‘With Shivraj &amp; I, It’s Ek Aur Ek Gyarah’","BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia being welcomed by party workers on his first visit to Bhopal.

Bhopal: A royal greeting at Bhopal airport and the welcome of a conquering hero at the BJP head office in Bhopal — Jyotiraditya Scindia’s homecoming as a saffron leader was as grand as it could be on Thursday.

Nearly 5,000 supporters thronged the airport for a glimpse of ‘Maharaj’, and swarmed all over his SUV. Scindia had to step out and walk half a kilometre to the main road, surrounded by cheering supporters.

The boisterous welcome stretched all along the 20km route to the BJP office, where it reached a crescendo. The man who had played a significant role in defeating BJP in Madhya Pradesh in 2018, was welcomed in royal fashion in the saffron camp that now sees itself within touching distance of regaining power, thanks to Scindia’s defection with 19 Congress MLAs.

In his impassioned speech, Scindia laid out the reasons for his shock resignation from Congress. “When the Scindia parivaar is challenged,” he said, quivering with emotion, “We fight for morality and truth.”

“It is easy to target a party from outside but to criticise the party while being a member is very difficult. Being the head of Scindia family, I have to speak the bitter truth. In 1967, my grandmother had to quit Congress. In 1990, my father was charged in fake hawala scam and now, when I raised the issue of guest teachers, withdrawal of police cases against farmers, delay in agri loan waiver and warned to hit the streets if promises made in ‘Vachan Patra’ were not fulfilled, I was asked to ‘go ahead’,” he said.

“Being a member of Scindia family, I had to take decisions when I was challenged on morality and truth. Now I have handed myself to BJP and brought only one thing with me — and that is my hard work,” he remarked.

“Today is a very emotional moment for me. I consider myself fortunate that with the blessings of BJP president J P Nadda ji, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji and home minister Amit Shah ji, the doors of this family were opened for me. I am dedicating myself to you, leaving the organisation with whom I spent 20 years,” Scindia told cheering BJP workers.

Praising former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Scindia said: “There are only two politicians who do not use air-conditioner in their cars — Shivraj and myself. When I and Shivraj join hands, then one plus one will become 11.”

AHMEDABAD: The rush for birth certificates at the civic body’s birth and death registration office, before officers verifying birth and death records for the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the 2021 census come knocking at their doors, has led several of the fragile pages of the records to be reduced to tatters.

Small chunks of paper pieces lie strewn across the department’s floor, as they are repeatedly brought out for verification. The standing committee of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation ( AMC ) on Thursday discussed the issue and decided to tender the job of digitizing the records soon. The department’s current staff can solve 20-odd queries a day; but queries have risen to 115 to 140 a day since mid-December.

Standing committee chairman Amul Bhatt said, “We will digitize the records very soon. This should have been done on priority.” Many of the records dating between 1932 and 1979 are stacked together and are now in poor shape. A senior official explained the complexity of municipal record-keeping. “Ward boundaries have changed with each election delimitation,” he said. For instance, prior to 1953, registers for Dariapur and Madhupura were one. Then in the 1960s, they were separated. Later, a new ward — Kazipur Dariapur — came into existence. Many of the records dating between 1932 and 1979 are stacked together are in tatters.

The lone peon, Jayanti Chanduji Thakore, 60, who knew about the records and sequence of indexing according to delimitation of wards spanning over eight decades retired in February and has refused to work for a paltry remuneration of Rs 5,000 a month. “I do help my colleagues back in office over phone who are still struggling with the records,” said Thakor.

But a separate room is allotted to anyone down with any disease. Every year, we come across cases of chickenpox or other seasonal diseases among examinees, for which the room is kept ready. We have allowed students to wear masks,” said BSS principal Sunita Sen. The headmaster of a school in Salt Lake has also allowed students to wear masks while writing their Class-XII board examinations.A senior official of West Bengal Higher Secondary Council, which is conducting the board examinations, said they had advised schools and exam centres to segregate students who turned up with cough, cold and breathlessness. “We have asked school authorities to keep a separate room for examinees down with measles or chicken pox.

HYDERABAD: This Hyderabadi is just eight years old and has given none other than global Swedish home furnishings retailer IKEA a design for its new soft toy – the Eggplant Monster Car.

Meet Ayaan Ahmed whose sketch has been developed into a soft toy that will be sold by the retail giant globally. Ayaan’s design is one of six designs selected by IKEA out of the 71,000 entries that poured in globally as part of the sixth edition of the annual IKEA Soft Toy Drawing Competition.

What also makes this feat of the Saidabad resident, who just got promoted to Class III at Mount Carmel Global School at Badangpet, more remarkable is that he is the first Indian kid whose design has made the cut in this contest.

The talented Hyderabadi boy took about two days to sketch the cute eggplant on wheels. “I love cars and brinjals so I drew the brinjal car,” said Ayaan.

Ayaan’s mother, Ramsha Khaliq pointed out that he developed his first brinjal car prototype when he was just three years old.

“When he was around three, his father got brinjal from the market. A fascinated Ayaan removed the wheels from his toy car and attached it to the brinjal and started wheeling it around the house,” Ramsha explained.

IKEA said the six shortlisted designs will be developed into real toys for its SAGOSKATT 2020 collection, a range of limited-edition soft toys designed by kids for kids and the entire sales proceeds will go to local charities that promote children’s right to play as part of its ‘Let’s Play!’ campaign.

Jorge Omar Santoyo Henaine, product developer for Children’s IKEA, said : “It’s a unique project where we involve children in product development. We go through every submission...and see if it can fit our collection. We are working together with our suppliers to bring it to life.”

The HC made it clear to the state, the Centre and the Indian Navy that they cannot cut a tree till they file their counters on what they are proposing to do with the fragile ecosystem. The ELF project is being set up by the Eastern Naval Command.

A bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy wondered as to how the forest department could allow construction of a low-frequency radar in a forest area while hearing a PIL filed by Damagundam Forest Protection joint action committee.

Agreeing with the apprehensions expressed by S Spandana Reddy, the counsel for the petitioner, the bench directed the authorities to make sure that not a single tree is cut in the area till further orders. The CJ also asked the petitioner to make the revenue department a respondent to the case since it was they who allotted land to the project. “We understand defence of the country is crucial and an important aspect, but environment is also our concern,” the Chief Justice said.

Assistant solicitor general N Rajeswara Rao urged the bench to restrict the status quo for a few days, but the bench made it clear that it would remain there till the Centre and other authorities file their counters. The case was adjourned to four weeks.

SURAT: A 68-year-old cleric of a madrassa at Amod village in Bharuch district was arrested by police for sexually molesting a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.

Abdullah Wali Patel alias Abdullah Vora, a resident of Amod village, has been accused of sexually molesting the minor girl who attended the madrassa where he taught. The issue came to light when the girl informed her parents about his disgusting acts.

Amod police said the cleric had lured the girl by offering her chocolates on a couple of occasions and showed her obscene videos in his mobile phone. He used to touch her private parts, kiss her and made her perform oral sex.

SM Rathod, police inspector of Amod police station, told TOI, “The girl was afraid to go to madrassa due to sexual harassment by the maulvi. She was unable to complain to her parents against him. However, she decided to explain her ordeal by writing a letter to her parents. After going through the letter, the parents decided to lodge a police complaint against the maulvi.”

Rathod said the maulvi was picked up from his residence at Darbar Tekra in the village on Thursday evening. He has booked under IPC section 376(2) and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POSCO).

“We are awaiting report of the medical examination of the girl from the government hospital. The maulvi will be presented in Bharuch district court on Friday,” Rathod added.

MYSURU: The state government’s budget proposal to involve private agencies in solid waste management could help improve garbage processing in Mysuru, which doesn’t have enough facilities.

Mysuru produces over 500 tonnes of solid waste every day. Of this, only about 200 tonnes is processed.

The Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) already runs a compost plant with the help of an outside agency, but a bigger public-private effort is needed to improve the city’s processing capacity.

In his budget speech earlier this month, chief minister BS Yediyurappa said comprehensive solid waste management programmes should be developed in all urban local bodies with external aid. Feasibility and detail project reports would be prepared this year, he added.

If these plans materialise, MCC will be able to remodel an existing solid waste plant in Vidyaranyapuram . The site, spread over 19 acres, is managed by a Delhi-based firm. The lease has expired, but the government has asked the civic body to continue using the firm’s services.

The machinery at the site is outdated and its capacity is limited; it can treat about 150-200 tonnes of waste every day. MCC also runs a few decentralised units, but their capacity is as low as 5 tonnes.

Civic officials have proposed to open two more units in Rayanakere and Kesare and install modern machinery at Vidyaranyapuram but are yet to receive the government’s approval.

MCC commissioner Gurudatta Hegde said though the directorate of municipal administration had not yet issued any instructions for public-private partnerships, such arrangements could improve solid waste management.

MYSURU: Mysuru Urban Development Authority (Muda) has encountered another case of impersonation to gobble up a site from a beneficiary.

The incident has come to light after the owner of the site L Raje Urs knocked on the doors of Muda seeking khata. The site was allotted to him 26 years ago. Shock was in store for him as the property had exchanged several hands without his knowledge and now Muda is seeking police assistance to uncover the crime.

Meanwhile, Muda authorities are sceptical about the actual owner of the property as earlier too khata has been obtained using the photo of the complainant. Muda secretary MK Savitha said, “Raje Urs, who has been allotted the site, has come after 26 years seeking khata but as per our records, the khata has been issued and the property has exchanged several hands since 2004. This has happened nearly twenty years ago. We are checking the details after filing a police complaint.”

The 30x40ft site in prime Vijayanagar location was registered in 2001 after allotment in 1994. First it was sold to Nataraj, by a person claiming himself as Raje Urs, and then after his demise, his children obtained khata and sold it to Shobha, who in turn sold it to Muddaiah and then Kannumuddaih, who is currently in possession of the property.

Raje Urs wanted the site to be registered in his daughter’s name and he went to Muda only to realise that the site has been misused. Since the site was vacant Raje Urs thought it was still in his possession.

This is not for the first time Muda is encountering a case of impersonation and cheating. This is just another case that has come to light.

281,['13/03/2020'],Bank of Buckingham canal in Indira Nagar encroached,"Chennai: The Buckingham canal , which is being polluted by untreated sewage along its course on Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR), is being encroached upon in Indira Nagar, Adyar.

A resident of the area said a landing wall on a portion of the canal’s bank was pulled down in parts and a wiremesh fence erected around the space where an earthmover and a truck are parked in the mornings. Once they move out, the place is ‘locked’ to stop the entry of people into the area, the resident said, adding that this was a blatant violation.

A Southern Railway official said it was originally proposed to lay a cemented road from the Kasturba Nagar MRTS station up to TIDEL park signal point, as part of the effortt to decongest the overcrowded Rajiv Gandhi Expressway (OMR). Already the road-laying work has been completed up to Indra Nagar station. However, the authorities were unable to remove the encroachments near the Tiruvanmiyur MRTS station due to which the road laying had to be given up.

When contacted, a senior Greater Chennai Corporation official said there was a proposal to create a walkway along the stretch. However, the corporation had to get a clearance from the Public Works Department (PWD) before creating the walkway. The corporation wrote to the PWD in this regard for obtaining clearance. However, no work has been started on this stretch. On the OMR side, the civic body had put up a fence during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to Chennai late last year.

When contacted, the PWD authorities said a letter had been received from the civic body which wanted to create a walkway. But, they have not issued any letter to go ahead with the proposal. An assistant engineers has been asked to inspect the spot and check if there is any violation. If confirmed, it will be removed, he promised.

Speaking to the media following the release, Deodhar said both YSRC and TDP are not committed to the development of local bodies.“TDP mocked the system by giving powers to unconstitutional ‘Janma-Bhoomi’ committees. YSRC is following in their footsteps by bringing the ward volunteer system. TDP did not conduct local body elections fearing defeat. YSRC is conducting elections unconstitutionally,” Deodhar said. He said he hoped that people would give a chance to the BJP and Jana Sena alliance.

Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan alleged that YSRC is threatening BJP and Jana Sena candidates and dissuading them from filing nominations. “The YSRC, which won 151 seats in assembly elections, is still afraid of going for local body polls. They are behaving high-handedly with opposition parties and attacking our leaders. The state election commission should take stringent action against YSRC goons who are attacking our leaders,” he said.

BJP state president Kanna Lakshminarayana said he has never seen a more unconstitutional election process in his 47-year political career. He alleged that the workers of the ruling party and preventing candidates of other parties from filling nomination papers.

283,['13/03/2020'],"4 Covid-19 suspects who left Mayo hosp traced, asked to return","Nagpur: The two men, a woman and a 4-year-old boy (and his mother), who allegedly left without permission from Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital’s (Mayo) Covid-19 isolation ward on Friday night have been traced, said district collector Ravindra Thakare. All had reported to the hospital with coronavirus-like symptoms. While the first three are from Nagpur, the mother and child are from Kerala.

Hospital sources said that the four were admitted to the isolation ward on Friday evening. They were all tested negative.

The woman, aged about 40, works as a domestic help at the house of the city’s first positive-tested patient who is also under observation in Mayo hospital. She was not among the 15 first-point contact of the positive-tested patient who were called to the Government Medical College and Hospital on Thursday for giving swabs.

The two men are not colleagues of the first patient as was reported earlier. One of them is 19 and the other 41 years old. They had recently travelled to Italy and Thailand.

The mother of the boy had travelled to The Netherlands and returned on March 6. She had come to attend a private function in city where the boy showed some symptoms. Her local contacts told her to go to Mayo and get a sample checked.

While the mother and child went back to the hotel they were staying, the other three were found at their homes.

“By Saturday afternoon, three of them have reported back to the Mayo Hospital while one of them, the cook, is on the way to the hospital. Their results are expected to come out by the evening,” said Thakare.

According to information available, all the patients told police that they were frustrated with the delay in knowing the status of their samples. “Also, being kept on the same floor as the first patient who has tested positive, they were apprehensive about contracting the virus,” said Thakare.

However, dean of Mayo Dr Ajay Keoliya said, “It is true that the suspects were staying in the same building where the first positive Covid-10 patient is under treatment. But, the patient is kept separately and those quarantined are in another area, even though on the same floor. There is no chance of contact or infection in this arrangement.”

Police said that the five left the ward one after the other around 10pm on Friday, claiming that they wanted to use the washroom and have tea.

The first patient's wife and colleague, who too tested positive, are in the isolation ward at the Government Medical College and Hospital. All three are apparently recovering well.

Zonal DCP Rahul Maknikar, who was on night rounds on Friday, said that the police were on high alert to trace the four adults and the child.

Meanwhile, city police chief BK Upadhyay said on Saturday that cops would help in escorting coronavirus suspects or positive patients but “will not directly intervene due to high health risks”. He did not want to comment on the issue of security breach at Mayo hospital on Saturday night.

284,['13/03/2020'],Another SMC officer lands in ACB net,"Surat: With every passing year , the number of officers of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) landing in the net of Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) is increasing. The number of cases used to remain less than five earlier. However, 2018 witnessed seven and 2019 eight cases of bribe and disproportionate assets (DA) registered against SMC staffers.

On Thursday, ACB sleuths arrested Rajesh Patel, 48, assistant engineer in Katargam zone of SMC. He was booked by ACB sleuths on Wednesday. An inquiry for having disproportionate assets was initiated by ACB against him in 2016 after he was caught accepting a bribe of Rs25,000 on February 15, 2016 when posted as assistant engineer in Rander zone.

Patel, an officer of town planning department, had demanded the bribe to give positive report for a construction project on a plot of land. The complainant had approached ACB when he demanded the bribe.

""ACB initiates DA case inquiry against all those officers who are caught accepting bribe. We are currently inquiring against a few officers of different departments,"" said N P Gohil, assistant director of ACB, Surat. Inquiry against Patel was done by N D Chauhan, assistant director, ACB, Ahmedabad. The investigation has been handed over to S N Desai, police inspector, ACB.

ACB officers checked wealth of Patel amassed during six previous years before he was caught taking bribe. The period under inquiry was April 2010 to March 2016. During inquiry, ACB found that Patel's income from legally declared sources was around Rs54 lakh while his total expenditure and investments totalled around Rs1.38 crore. ACB found Rs84.74 lakh more wealth either in the name of the accused or his family members.

ACB officers checked details of salary, bank account statement, property documents, income tax details etc. The accused could not give satisfactory replies to ACB officers to their queries from where he amassed so much of wealth.

BOXES

Actual market value of the property is much higher

Top ACB officials said the actual worth of the property of the accused Rajesh Patel was much higher than recorded in disproportionate assets (DA) case. ""ACB recorded the value of the property as per its jantri rate while the market value is much higher. If we estimate wealth of the accused as per market rate of the property, the accused has amassed huge wealth,"" said Keshav Kumar, director, ACB Gujarat.

Accused nabbed while on duty

ACB officials decided to nab Rajesh Patel during early hours of Thursday. Patel was supervising a demolition work in Katargam when ACB team nabbed him. ""We decided at night to arrest the accused. We planned during early hours of Thursday how to make a clean arrest. ACB wanted to arrest the accused soon after registering the complaint to ensure that he doesn't get a chance to escape,"" said an ACB officer.

285,['13/03/2020'],‘Not sure if my brother can fly in from Jeddah to look after mom’,"There are situations and eventualities that one can plan for. And, there are developments that are unforeseen. What’s happening now, in India and rest of the world, is somewhere in between.

When I left the US for Kolkata on March 3, novel coronavirus was very much on my mind. Normally, I wouldn’t have travelled amid such uncertainty. But this was an emergency trip. My mother , who lives in Lake Town , was unwell. Before leaving my home in Connecticut , I read up on Covid-19 as much as I could and followed the regimen on the flight. Whenever I went to the washroom, I washed my hands thoroughly with soap and applied hand sanitizer on returning to the seat.

In Kolkata, I have been busy doing the rounds of hospitals with my mother for check-ups. She is a bit better now and I am scheduled to leave on Sunday. My younger brother, who works and lives in Jeddah , was supposed to come over around March 22-March 23 and be with my parents till my mother’s health improved. His travel plan to India later this month is now uncertain. I don’t know whether airlines will continue to operate then or not and if he would be quarantined on arrival.

But now, everything is in a state of flux. The latest Government of India directive, restricting entry of foreigners and even overseas citizen of India (OCI) card-holders till April 15, means there will be a rush for Indians to return and foreigners to exit. Also, US president Donald Trump on Wednesday announced an embargo on flights into the US from Europe, other than the UK. So, there is a lot of uncertainty in travel at a time like this.

My flight is barely three days away and it is via Doha in Qatar. So I should be able to fly home. Also, since I am now an American citizen and work in the government sector, there is no pay-related issue. But the same does not hold true for those in the private sector. Three weeks of unpaid leave could put any family in huge financial stress, including uncertainty about payment of house mortgage and car loan.

286,['13/03/2020'],"Sayra hanging: Teen killed self, SIT says","Ahmedabad: A special investigation team (SIT) comprising officials of CID (crime and railways) on Thursday said that the 19-year-old woman from Sayra village of Modasa taluka whose body was found hanging in the village was neither raped nor murdered.

The officials said that she had committed suicide.

DIG (crime and railways) Gautam Parmar, who headed the SIT, told reporters on Thursday that the woman was in a relationship with one of the accused in the case, Bimal Bharwad. Parmar said Bharwad had refused to continue with the affair, which led the woman to kill herself.

Parmar said that the woman had met Bharwad through her elder sister and another man — Darshan Bharwad — on December 14 or 15 last year. Bharwad was a married man who had also been in a relationship with the woman’s sister.

Parmar said that the woman had begun pressuring Bharwad to marry her, saying that she would reveal their relationship to her sister and his wife. Parmar said the SIT has found that the woman had called Bharwad 40 times and had sent 67 messages to him on December 31, asking him to marry her.

The SIT recovered the calls with the help of FSL experts; in some calls, Bharwad is heard abusing the woman, said Parmar.

Parmar said that the woman called Bharwad on January 1, 2020, and told him to meet her. “He revealed this to the woman’s sister who advised him against the meeting,” Parmar said. “But the woman told Bharwad that unless he met her, she would tell his wife about the relationship. So he reached her village and picked up her up.”

Later, they both came to Modasa town where they argued for two hours. According to police, the woman refused to get down from Bharwad’s car. “So Bharwad called the woman’s sister,” said Parmar. “The woman did not relent even after her sister arrived on the scene. So the sister snatched the woman’s cellphone to determine if it had the number of Bharwad’s wife. The sister then broke the cellphone.”

The woman got down from the car to inspect her cellphone and taking the opportunity, Bharwad fled. Aggrieved, the woman boarded an autorickshaw to Sayra village. Parmar said that the woman may have hanged herself on January 4. Her body was found on January 5.

Parmar said that neither FSL reports nor the postmortem indicated rape or murder.

AHMEDABAD: A man on a motorcycle hit a woman, carried her on the front fender for about 50 feet, ran her over and then fled, in the Prahladnagar area of the city on Tuesday. This incident was captured on CCTV camera, but the motorcyclist is still at large.

According to the FIR filed with SG-2 Division traffic police, Gunjan Shah, 35, is an HR manager with Citrin Cooperman India LLP in Prahladnagar and a resident of Goyal Intercity on Drive-In Road. Her husband stays in the US.

Shah’s brother, Harshal Bhatt, in the FIR stated that he had on Tuesday evening got a call from Shah’s colleague, Disha Shah, telling him that his sister had met with an accident when she was crossing the road in front of Shapath 5 in Prahladnagar.

“When she was crossing the road to reach her car in the parking area, a speeding motorcycle hit her. She was carried on the front fender of the motorcycle but the man did not stop and kept riding,” states Bhatt.

“He rode for about 50 feet and then she fell on to the road. The man then ran over her and fled. People rushed to her and took her to the side of the road. She was unconscious and was taken to a nearby private hospital,” adds the FIR.

Bhatt told TOI that Shah had suffered fractures in her pelvis and left knee, for which she was operated on and is gradually recovering. She is hospitalized and will have to bear the pain for four or five months, he said.

A police official of SG-2 division traffic police said they have got CCTV footage of the accident but have not been able to identify the accused so far.

Police filed a case for rash driving, causing hurt by an act endangering the life or personal safety of others and causing grievous hurt, against an unknown man and began an investigation.

JAIPUR: AICC general secretary Mukul Wasnik on Thursday alleged that Congress MLAs from Madhya Pradesh have been held captive in Bengaluru.

Their mobile phones have been taken away and they are now incommunicado, Wasnik said, adding that the party is now exploring the option of approaching the court for their release.

He also alleged that Bengaluru police did not allow Narayan Singh, father of Manoj Chaudhary, an MLA in the Scindia camp now in Bengaluru, to meet him. Even family members were not permitted to meet the MLAs, which is denial of individual freedom, he said.

Wasnik said ministers Jitu Patwari, Lakhan Singh, and Chaudhary’s father went to Bengaluru to meet the MLAs, but they were beaten up by police and BJP workers. He said Lakhan and Patwari were put under police custody for hours.

The MP Congress unit has kept its fingers crossed with no headway in contacting the rebel MLAs loyal to turncoat Jyotiraditya Scindia in Bengaluru. As many as 85 MLAs in the Congress camp have been shifted to two luxury resorts in Jaipur after a faction of 22 MLAs led by Scindia announced their resignation from the party.

The Congress leaders, while exuding confidence in the survival of the Kamal Nath government, did not disclose the exact number of MLAs in their camp in Jaipur.

AICC general secretary Sanjay Kapoor said, “We will prove our numbers when the time arrives. We have enough numbers to save the government.”

The MLAs staying at the Tree House resort were taken out for lunch at the Buena Vista resort during the day.

MLAs Ashok Kumar and Sunil Saraf in a brief interaction with media strongly condemned the horse-trading tactics adopted by BJP claiming that they are united and will defeat the designs of the BJP.

The state Congress leaders were conspicuous by their absence during the day as they were busy with the ongoing assembly session.

CHENNAI: Searches at actor Vijay ’s residence ended on Thursday, Income Tax investigation officials said, adding that they checked his accounts and got details about his remuneration from two of his movies.

“We found that the actor has shown as salary Rs 50 crore from ‘ Bigil ’, which was a box office hit, and Rs 80 crore from ‘Master’, which is yet to be released. We found that the actor paid taxes for the salaries received for both movies and we have no questions on this,” a senior I-T official told TOI.

The searches started at Vijay’s residence, at the office of AGS Entertainment, which produced ‘Bigil’, and at financier Anbu Cheziyan’s residence on February 5. “Though we have completed the searches, we are yet to complete our examination of the documents and other papers which we seized from various places belonging to the three assessors,” said the official.

A preliminary examination of the documents, however, raised doubts about the investments made by the actor and his family members, he said. “We have started examining the documents and accounts of the actor and his family members. There are questionable investments on which tax will be raised.”

The searches began after the department found a common thread among all the entities following the success of ‘Bigil’ which collected around Rs 300 crore.

“About 38 premises of the [AGS Entertainment] group were covered in the search and survey operation spread over Chennai and Madurai. The highlight of the search is the seizure of unaccounted cash of about Rs 77 crore from hideouts and places at Chennai and Madurai, purportedly belonging to the financier Anbu Cheziyan,” said the official.

As part of the searches, I-T officials went to the shoot of ‘Master’ in Neyveli and took the actor with them. Vijay and his family members were questioned for not less than 20 hours. “Analysis of the accounts available at the office is on. Evidence of actual receipts and expenses, and remuneration paid to artists is under investigation.”

They had demanded the bribe from a businessman from Nagaur to settle the matter pertaining to an undeclared income drawn by the I-T officials on the businessman.

According to the spokesperson ( CBI ), R K Gaur, a case had been registered on a complaint, against two Income Tax officers, an Income Tax inspector, all from the Income Tax Department, Nagaur; a Chartered Accountant and others.

“The allegations were that these officials of the Income Tax Department demanded a bribe of Rs 5 lakh from the complainant, through a Nagaur-based Chartered Accountant, for settling issues arising out of an Income Tax survey conducted by the Income Tax Department on the business premises of the complainant’s firms and his family members at Nagaur a few days back,” said Gaur.

After the verification of the complaint, CBI laid a trap and caught the Chartered Accountant Suresh Pareek, while demanding and accepting the negotiated bribe amount of Rs 4 lakh. After the investigation and interrogation of Pareek, an Income Tax officer Laxman Singh and an Income Tax inspector Prem Sukh Didel were also arrested by the CBI.

“Searches were conducted at the residential and office premises of the accused at 10 different places at Nagaur, Jaipur and Merta city, which resulted in recovery of incriminating documents,” Gaur informed. More officers of the department are on the radar of the CBI and more arrests cannot be ruled out followed by further investigation. Teams of CBI also visited the I-T office in Nagaur for investigation.

According to the sources, the survey at the business premises of the complainant had been conducted by the I-T officers on March 5 and 6 and a large income of approximately Rs 3 crore had been calculated by them as undeclared income. In order to weaken the case against the businessman, the officers had been building pressure on him demanding a bribe of Rs 5 lakh through the chartered accountant Pareek.

The harassed businessman brought the matter to the CBI and a trap was laid by the CBI sleuths on Thursday. As per the plan, the officers called the businessman at the residence of Pareek in Nagaur with the bribe amount and the moment he handed over the amount to Pareek, CBI sleuths swung into action, arresting Pareek and seized the money.

The hoteliers said their occupancy rates is likely to plummet by 60% with the clients from domestic and international destinations cancelling or deferring their travel plans.

While the hotel occupancy is expected to go down by 60% across leading hotels, the impact on mid-sized hotels is likely to be more and drop could be over 70%.

The Southern Gujarat Hotels and Restaurants Association (SHARA) has said that the virus outbreak has dealt a big blow to the hotel industry in Surat. While the international clients have completely stopped visiting the city, there is a drastic fall in the domestic business clients from the diamond and textile sectors.

Vice-president of SHARA, Sanat Relia said, “Hotels occupancy is down 60% and are facing more cancellations from the overseas clients due to travel restrictions by their respective countries.”

Relia added, “Even the domestic clients are cancelling travel plans out of fear after the government imposed travel restrictions.”

MADURAI: Conductors using saliva on their fingers while issuing tickets is a common practice. Taking into consideration the Covid-19 outbreak and its nature of spreading through infected fluid such as droplets, a consumer body has written to transport minister M R Vijayabhaskar to intervene and put an end to this practice.

While some government bus conductors issue printed tickets from point of sale machines, most government as well as private town and mini buses in cities and rural areas still use printed tickets. Though the conductor’s pouch has a provision to have a wet sponge for the purpose, saliva is still the preferred mode to wet the finger.

Executive director of Empower centre for consumer and environment education, research and advocacy A Shankar said that by touching their tongue for saliva while issuing ticket directly puts the conductor at risk of getting infected as they could be accidentally dealing with an infected person.

Conductors don’t have the opportunity to wash their hands while collecting the fare, handing over the ticket and balance to every passenger. “The unhealthy practice of touching their tongue with their fingers for every transaction also puts the commuters in the danger of getting infected,” Shankar said.

Family of the deceased alleged that police heard their screams only after the victim had died.

Deceased Vinay Yadav, his father Tribhovan, 60, and elder brother Vinay, 34, a disabled person, were nabbed from Balaji Nagar and brought to Pandesara police station at around 7.30pm after a brawl with their neighbour. The neighbour called police and the trio was detained and put in the lock-up at around 8.30pm on Tuesday.

""I told police not to keep Vinay in lock-up as he had breathing problem but they didn’t listen. I kept shouting throughout the night whenever Vinay told me that he was feeling suffocated,” Tribhovan told TOI.

""There were about 15 other people in the 10ft by 10ft size lock-up. It was difficult for even me to breathe since I am an asthma patient,” he added.

Tribhovan and Vinay began to scream when Vimal fell unconscious at around 7.45am on Wednesday. ""Whole night police did not come. They came because of our screams in the morning and smashed the lock-up grill. We supported Vimal to stand up but he collapsed. He was declared dead by the paramedic of 108 ambulance,"" said Tribhovan.

""Police at night asked for Rs2,000 to release us when our relatives came to get us out on bail. We refused to pay the money after which they put us in the lock-up,"" said Vimal.

""There are CCTV cameras in police station and the lock-up. We will examine the footages to check whether the cops had gone to help the family members of the deceased after hearing their screams in the night. If they did not take any action despite requests, it is a case of negligence on the part of cops and they will face action,"" said J K Pandya, assistant commissioner of police, F division.

Locals have now demanded that the Valpoi Municipal Council construct bus sheds, especially at prime locations, at the earliest.

“Presently temperatures are as high as 38 to 40 degrees Celsius, so its impossible to stand in the open,” president of the Valpoi Advocates Association Yeshwant Gauns said. He said that there is especially pressing need for a bus shed near the community health centre.

While Gauns said that the council should erect a shed at the spot at the earliest, another resident said that absence of a shed here means that patients, including pregnant women, people with infants and senior citizens, visiting the health centre have to suffer.

Residents, who board a bus near the Hathwada junction, said that there used to be a bus shed at the stop eight years ago, but it was demolished for road widening works. “Since then we are waiting for the authorities to erect one again,” locals said.

Chairperson of the council Akhtar Ali Shah told TOI that he would look into the matter.

Local Ashish Kanekar said that bus sheds is a long pending demand of the people of Valpoi. “During the monsoon we will plant trees at a few places so that there is at least some natural shade. However, we can go forward with the initiative only if landowners have no objection,” Kanekar said.

305,['13/03/2020'],Northern Railway tries to replicate airport’s pick-and-drop at New Delhi station,"NEW DELHi: Trying to replicate an airport-like model for ‘pick and drop’ vehicles at the Ajmeri Gate side of New Delhi railway station, Northern Railway has started a new ‘parking-cum-access control rights’ system, which aims to reduce congestion in the three traffic lanes by charging vehicles after lapsing of eight minutes.While commercial vehicles will be immediately charged Rs 30 when they enter the three lanes, non-commercial vehicles will have eight minutes to pick up a passenger, following which Rs 50 will be levied on them. If a car remains in the three lanes for more than 30 minutes — a fine of Rs 1,000 will be levied on the vehicle, which will then be towed away, officials said.Divisional railway manager, Delhi Divison, SC Jain told TOI that the model was designed keeping in mind congestion problems, as vehicle owners — instead of parking in the dedicated zone — would stop their vehicles in the ‘pick and drop’ lanes — leading to longer queues and congestion.“Our study estimated that in order to pick up a passenger, it only takes around two-three minutes. We have still given non-commercial vehicles up to eight minutes to enter the lane, stop and pick up/ drop a passenger. This is free of cost for them. Only after eight minutes they will have to pay,” said Jain.For non-commercial vehicles, meanwhile, the first eight minutes mean an entry fee of Rs 30, which increases to Rs 50 (8-15 minutes) and Rs 200 (15-30 minutes). Jain said there is already a dedicated fourth lane for pre-paid taxis which is not chargeable. “If a commercial vehicle wants to pick up a passenger, they can enter the lane and leave on time. If they stay longer, they will be charged for that. If one needs to stay longer, they can simply go to the dedicated parking zones where the rates haven’t changed,” said Jain.According to railway officials the model will be analysed for the next few months, the success of which may lead to a similar model being placed at the Paharganj side of the railway station. “No pickup and drop facility will be permitted beyond the 30 minutes and a vehicle so detected will be fined Rs 1,000 and towed away,” said an official.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74603180,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-245162,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/railways-tries-to-replicate-airports-pick-and-drop-at-new-delhi-station/articleshow/74602200.cms

Later addressing a press conference at the state Congress office, Digvijaya claimed that the present crisis started after Scindia’s defeat in the Lok Sabha elections from Guna last year. He was hurt about the loss in the elections and then got in touch with Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. When state BJP leaders were told, they said they can bring down the government themselves. Hence, started the first encounter at the Manesar Hotel early this month. That operation was minus Scindia and led by BJP’s Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Narottam Mishra, Vishwas Sarang, Bhupendra Singh and Rampal Singh,” Digvijaya said.

The Corlim-based firm was run by two women entrepreneurs, but was shut down in 2004. The firm’s workers were paid all their dues and the balance amount of Rs 24,000 was left over with LIC.

“To release the funds, LIC sought an NOC from the income tax department to ascertain that there are no dues from the unit owed to the government. The application for the NOC was sought in 2017,” said a senior industry representative.

The firm and industry bodies intend to raise this issue at an outreach programme organised by the income tax department at the Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry on Friday. The Centre has notified 'Vivaad se Vishwas Scheme 2020' to resolve pending tax litigation and disputed matters which remain unsettled as on January 1.

“This is a great opportunity for resolution of disputes related to direct tax for taxpayers. In order to encourage taxpayers to take benefit from the scheme, necessary guidance and help in understanding the scheme and assistance with procedural compliance for scheme is being readily provided,” an income tax department official said.

However, industry stakeholders feel that unnecessary compliances and red tape continues to plague the industry.

314,['13/03/2020'],Enforcement wing keen on rooting out cannabis trade; engg students ‘addicted’,"Vijayawada: Around 0.2 percent people use cannabis products in the state. Curiosity and peer pressure have been attributed as factors for youngsters using various forms of cannabis.

The cannabis grown in tribal pockets of Visakhapatnam and East Godavari districts along the Andhra Odisha Border (AOB) are said to be the best weed in the national market next to Idukki Gold in Kerala. As per estimates, ganja growers in AP produce over 60 lakh kgs of weed a year and Vizag ganja has spread its market across the country.

As per the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment’s survey on Magnitude of Substance Use in India- 2019, Andhra Pradesh—with 0.2 per cent—is listed where illegal cannabis products (ganja, charas, and a few others) are used by the people in the state. The survey says that Sikkim with 7.3 per cent is listed as top in ganja consumption followed by Nagaland with 4.7 per cent, Odisha 4.7 per cent, Arunachal Pradesh 4.2 percent, Delhi 3.8 per cent. However, Vizag ganja was found everywhere in the country.

“We raided some private hostels in Guntur district and found students of engineering and management colleges were addicted to weed. They spend a good amount to procure the weed,” said Ch Prameela Rani, inspector of Prohibition and Excise Department.

The excise officials said cultivation, selling, buying and consumption of cannabis was illegal and punishable as per the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.

Sharing concern on the prevalence of marijuana users among students and youngsters, Dr Uma Raju of Greenvalley Foundation in Vizag, which deals with substance-addicted patients, said the definition of happiness has changed for youngsters and some weed users claim that ganja is aphrodisiac. There was no study to establish that cannabis is an aphrodisiac, she added.

The youngsters are consuming weed in the form of cigarettes in Vizag and Vijayawada. Sometimes, they turn to ganja smugglers to meet their vices, said A Trinad Rao, a senior police officer with Task Force Wing.

“There is no data on ganja users and trends of consumption in the state. However, rooting out cannabis trade will be top priority with coordination between agencies,” said Vineet Brij Lal, Director of Enforcement, Prohibition and Excise.

The matter is likely to come up for hearing on April 21. “The Prime Minister has assured to look into the matter,” Sawant said.

Sawant met the Prime Minister and had “a fruitful discussion on wide ranging issues” including mining, Mopa international airport, ZP polls besides various developmental projects.

Speaking to TOI, Sawant said that he briefed Modi on how mining is important for the state’s economy. “Union mines ministry has to file the affidavit. I have urged PM to do the needful,” he said.

The state government had filed a review petition on February 7, 2018, in the apex court against the order quashing second renewal of 88 mining leases and halting mining activities in state on March 15, 2018.

Two mining companies had approached the apex court for extension of mining leases till 2037.

The state government had maintained before the Supreme Court that the mining leases can be extended up to year 2037, as per the contention of the companies, but it would abide by the decision of the court.

The state government said that the mining companies had made a representation to the mines department contending that under the amendment to Section 8 (A) of the Mines and Minerals Development Act, they are entitled to extend their mining leases up to 2037.

The state government had said that the mining concessions which were granted by the erstwhile Portuguese regime were converted into leases under the MMDR Act with effect from 1987 and consequently, the 50-year mining leases as contemplated under Section 8 (A) would be extended up to 2037.

The officials are supposed to appear before the committee in New Delhi on March 17.

In November last year, Union minister of state for agriculture Kailash Chaudhary and MP Hanuman Beniwal faced an attack in a public gathering in Barmer. Both of them alleged that stones were pelted and assailants had also fired in air.

The committee of privileges at Lok Sabha has asked D B Gupta, chief secretary, government of Rajasthan, Bhupendra Yadav, DGP, Rajasthan police, Umesh Mishra, ADG(Intelligence), Sanjay Sotriya, DIG (Vigilance), Sharad Choudhary, then SP, Barmer, and Amit Dhaka, special secretary (administration) to the chief minister Ashok Gehlot to appear before the committee on March 17.

“It was an unfortunate incident. Till date no case has been registered by the Rajasthan police which shows that it was a planned attack. The privileges committee of Lok Sabha will take stringent action against the officers concerned,” said Narayan Beniwal, brother of MP Beniwal and MLA of Rastriya Loktanrik Party (RLP) from Khinvsar.

The RLP legislator criticised the attack and maintained that the Lok Sabha’s privileges committee will take proper action. “The incident has already shown that law and order is in worst shape in Rajasthan.

Goa Women Forward’s (GWF) chief Ashma Sayed said that 39 cases of rape have been registered during the last six months, indicating that a woman is raped every five days.

“What is the point of saying women empowerment or women’s day when women are not safe? Women are not secure at all. What efforts are being taken by this government for the security of women? The government should take steps to curb this crime,” said Sayed.

She said that Goa Police’s presence in several hinterland villages is negligible and the lack of streetlights encouraged men to commit crimes against women.

“Our BJP women made a big noise about rape taking place in the capital. Why are they quiet today? Is it because the under trials of rape are in their party?” she said.

The unidentified caller threatened the MLA on phone that his movements were being tracked and he will be killed anytime.

Sources said Solanki was returning to his house at Tankari village after attending a meeting in Jambusar on the night of March 9 when he received a call from an international number. The caller reportedly said, “I am following your movements. Wherever you go in the state, I will kill you.”

Solanki told TOI, “A few days ago, my family members had reprimanded a woman selling snacks outside the primary school for girls located in front of our house at Tankari village. She was throwing dirty water and leftovers outside the school and was asked by my family members not to do that. She started quarrelling with them over the issue and a complaint was given to police.

BHOPAL: The 19 Congress MLAs (six of them ministers) from Scindia camp, who resigned from the party in solidarity with him, may get ticket to contest the by-polls or mid-term polls as the case may turn out to be, and ministers may get ministerial berth again in the BJP government (if Kamal Nath government falls and replaced by the BJP government) but what happens to hundreds of Scindia supporters in the Congress party who have also resigned with him. What would be their future and would they be accommodated in the saffron party in the same way as Scindia or his supporter ministers or MLAs may be accommodated?

Pankaj Chaturvedi, who was Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) spokesperson from Scindia quota, took no time to resign after Scindia shared his resignation letter sent to Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, on March 10. “I have also resigned. I would be where my leader is,” was his reply when asked whether he was with the Congress or the BJP.

When asked whether he had any communication with Scindia on how he proposes to accommodate him or other supporters like him (who is not a minister or an MLA), he said, “No. I have full faith in him. He has always taken care of us and we are sure he would continue doing it.”

Pramod Tandon, who was president of Indore (city) unit of Congress party, also resigned in solidarity with his leader, Jyotiraditya Scindia . When asked whether he is not feeling vulnerable on whether he would get same kind of prominence in the BJP as he had in the Congress party, Tandon said “I have resigned from the Congress but not joined the BJP as yet. I will decide on the issue once I consult Scindiaji. But, I have complete faith in him and there is no question of feeling vulnerable in any manner.”

When asked whether he has had any talks with Scindia in the past few days, Tandon said “No. He must have been busy of late. I would have a meeting with him in 4-5 days.”

Surendra Sharma, who is PCC general secretary from Gwalior, also resigned from the party as soon as Scindia announced his decision to quit the Congress. When asked whether he doesn’t see an uncertain future ahead of him, he said “I worked with bade Maharaj ( Madhavrao Scindia ). For past 20 years, I am with him. Where would I go from here in the Congress itself, if Maharaj is not there? Do you expect me to find a new leader and begin afresh? BJP may not give me post but I will still be able to stand up before Maharaj and ask for anything with a right.”

Not less than 10,000 kilogram of chicken is sold in the city on weekdays which trebles during the weekend. However, for the past few days, chicken shops in the city have been finding it difficult to make a profit of even Rs 100 a day.

S Ibrahim, who runs a chicken shop on Nethaji Road, said that usually they sell live chicken for about Rs 80 to Rs 90 a kilo and make a profit of about Rs 40 a kilogram. Now the market rate for live chicken has gone down to between Rs 20 and Rs 39 and a trader stood to gain just Rs 10 or even less, which would not even meet the electricity charges for his shop. Many of the meat shops that dot the city’s roads remained closed on Thursday as Wednesday’s sales had been very dull.

However, shops which are popular for chicken dishes such as tandoori, chilli chicken, boneless, wings and other things continue to maintain the price as in last week. “There is no price drop on the online delivery systems and not even offers,’’ said Rahul, a software engineer who has all three meals at hotels.Kumar, manager of a leading hotel, said they did have complaints from customers about the high price of some chicken items and they had to convince them that the dip in prices of raw meat was temporary and hence reduction of prices could not be done immediately. “The demand for chicken-based items such as curry, tandoori chicken and biryani has also gone down in the past week,’’ he added.

R Ganesan, president of K Pudur Chamber of Commerce and member of broiler chicken traders association, said that false propaganda had hit the sale of chicken in the city badly in the past one week. “If at all people are affected by chicken it will be those who cut the meat and sellers. The government should step in and alleviate the fears of the people,’’ he said.

NEW DELHI: Describing it as a step towards National Register of Citizens (NRC), the AAP government may bring a resolution against the National Population Register (NPR) in the day-long special Delhi assembly session on March 13.

Sources said the legislators may argue that the current atmosphere in Delhi — especially in the wake of communal riots in northeast and protests at several other areas — was not favourable for the update of NPR, which is slated to begin from April 1, and may demand its suspension. The legislators may also demand that the NPR questionnaire may be reverted to 2010 format, which did not require an individual to share additional information such as the place of birth of their parents.

“There is a general sense that in this atmosphere there was a need to take a stand to allay the general fear of the minorities,” said a legislator requesting anonymity.

The NPR, which began in 2010 and updated in 2015, is a list of “usual residents” of the country, which means those who have been residing in a local area for at least last six months or intend to stay in a particular location for the next six months.

Delhi has witnessed massive protests against the amended citizenship act and people fear that NPR may be the first step towards bringing nationwide NRC.

The Delhi assembly is also likely to have a detailed discussion on CAA and NRC apart from the coronavirus scare. The AAP had voted against the citizenship law amendments in both houses of the Parliament. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had stressed that entire country should “reject” the law, arguing that it will affect “both Hindus and Muslims” in equal measure.

Nagpur: Even though the city has around 150 beds reserved for Covid-19 cases at two government and one private hospital, authorities are reaching out to more private hospitals as part of their preparedness to tackle the challenge.

On Thursday, state, district and local health officials held a meeting with Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) to chalk out a plan in case government facilities fall short for quarantine and treatment.

Earlier, there was talk of six private hospitals extending support to provide isolation wards, but sources said nothing has been finalized as on date. Another meeting has been scheduled for Monday. The main problem in private hospitals is lack of separate facilities for such a ward.

Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) has 72 beds earmarked for coronavirus cases, Mayo Hospital has 25 while Lata Mangeshkar has offered 53.

While health officials are looking for specific facility for isolation wards, private hospitals too are in a fix given the risks involved.

One issue is avoiding centralized AC system, which is installed in almost all big private hospitals. “The chance of virus spreading fast is more in this system,” officials said.

Private players are looking at the possibility of offering one entire hospital as an isolation ward.

“The issue with private hospitals is that whenever they were built they never contemplated a separate entrance or air filtration system for the ideal isolation facility. No private hospital usually contemplates this. We can also thinking, if there are a lot of patients, a one entire hospital can become an isolation facility. It will become easy,” said convener of VHA Dr Anup Marar.

Marar added that private hospitals shall always cooperate and extend all help to the government in times of crisis.

Some private hospitals are also worried about the health of their own doctors and paramedical staff, who will become the first point of contact with suspected cases.

However, the fishermen, who were to be handed over to the Tuticorin Marine police on Thursday, were reportedly handed over to the Sri Lankan enforcement officials due to Covid-19 scare.

Marine police sources said the boats were spotted about 70 nautical miles (130km), south of Kanyakumari. A communication from the ICG, Tuticorin, said that they apprehended three boats - Sugandhi, Seral and Netmi - during a security patrol for violation of sections 3 and 7 of The Maritime Zones of India (Regulation of Fishing by Foreign Vessels) Act, 1981. Escorted by ICG ship Abiraj, they were expected to reach the Tuticorin harbour around 11.30am on Thursday and handed over to the marine police for questioning. It is learnt that they were taken back to IMBL due to global Covid-19 outbreak. ICG officials in Tuticorin were not available for comment on the reason behind releasing Lankan fishermen.

The marine police said that a stretch between 100 to 150 nautical miles south of Kanyakumari is a wedge bank for mechanised boats from Sri Lanka. They suspected that the men could have accidentally crossed the IMBL while fishing. Marine police sources added that fishermen were also not involved in smuggling or activities that posed a threat to India’s national security, following which the ICG handed them over to the Lankan navy.

Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation ( KMRC ), implementing agency of the project, however, ruled out a repeat of the August 31 disaster, considering the host of precautionary measures they have taken for the second phase of tunnelling.Residents panicked nonetheless as buildings along the narrow bylane off Bowbazar developed cracks in the last 36 hours. Crack meter readings on the terrace of 5/2 Gour De Lane revealed that fissures had increased almost four times — from 4.5mm on Wednesday to 16mm on Thursday.Tiloki Kesari, one of the owners, took TOI on a round of the well-maintained three-storey structure that had passed the mandatory building condition survey (BCS) undertaken to assess stability of structures ahead of the tunnelling. Unable to sleep the night at the hotel where they have been put up due to the emergency evacuation , he had come to check the extent of damage in the morning. “It took 40 minutes to get my immobile mother down the narrow staircase,” he said.Asked why this building that fell on the TBM ’s influence zone of 25m wasn’t evacuated before the tunnelling, an official said, “All the parameters suggested that it was a healthy structure.” Kesari, an electrical goods trader at Tiretta Bazar, said, “Yes, we have maintained the property that my grandfather had bought 125 years ago. Suddenly, it seems to be falling apart.”He and his family were evacuated when Chundee, the TBM that was digging the west-bound tunnel, hit the aquifer below the nearby Durga Pithuri Lane on August 31. The machine is now lying defunct 14m below the ground. Its twin, Urvi, resumed tunnelling on February 18 on Calcutta high court’s orders.“In August, some cracks had appeared on the walls of our building. But that was nothing compared to these,” Kesari said. KMRC and ITD ITD-Cementation , contracted to build the last leg of East-West Metro, are taking a several measures to strengthen the Kesari residence. The entire building has been propped up with iron beams. Grout mixtures (cement, sand and water) are being injected. “The residents shouldn’t panic. If they are feeling insecure, we are ready to shift them to hotels,” a KMRC spokesperson said.Debashish Pradhan, 33, a resident of 4C Gour De Lane, said, “And what happens after we return from the hotel? The tunnelling work should be stopped immediately.”",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74603501,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-164797,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/midnight-evacuation-as-bldg-cracks-widen-on-e-w-route/articleshow/74602262.cms

NEW DELHI: A 22-year-old woman who was being blackmailed by her former lover allegedly committed suicide at her residence in northeast Delhi’s Jagatpuri on Wednesday afternoon. Police have arrested the mother-son duo in connection with the case on Thursday. The accused have been identified as Pankaj Dang and his mother Alka Dang.

According to the cops, Pankaj had created a ruckus at the engagement ceremony of the deceased, which eventually had to be called off because of the claims made by him. Police have also seized the mobile phone of Pankaj and Alka.

Family members of the deceased alleged that the girl had on March 8 written to police informing them about the Pankaj blackmailing her. No action was, however, taken, the kin claimed.

After the victim hanged herself, her mother filed another complaint and a case of abetment to suicide and extortion was registered against Pankaj and his mother.

Police said the victim had come to know that Pankaj was involved in a betting racket and had started distancing herself from him. However, the accused started blackmailing her and troubled her mother. The victim’s family had even given Rs 50,000 to the accused. Pankaj, however, demanded Rs 10 lakh.

According to the police, the mother-son duo also ruined the victim’s engagement ceremony after they reached the venue and created a ruckus. The girl’s mother told the cops that her daughter, who was troubled by the constant blackmailing and the money demands, found no other choice but to hang herself and commit suicide.

Out of the 10 gardens in PCB limits, the maintenance of two has been outsourced to a private firm under its corporate social responsibility initiative, a PCB official said, confirming that 19 islands in the area were in bad shape.

“We cannot maintain the gardens and islands the way we used to due to the prevailing financial condition. For now, we are primarily focused on providing basic services like water to these gardens and islands,” PCB chief executive officer Amit Kumar told TOI.

The board’s call for private help has also failed to find many takers. “Talks are going on with various companies and organizations as of now. However, we need time to examine the conditions that these companies have mentioned in their proposals before taking the final decision. One of the private companies has agreed to take over two gardens and some of the islands without any condition,” Kumar said.

The board needs at least Rs7.5 lakh per month for maintaining the gardens and islands. It has not issued any fresh tender regarding the maintenance of their gardens and islands for the last one year. The then president Major General Navneet Kumar had suggested the board authorities to bring more CSR funds to maintain these facilities.

“Currently, the board has only six staffers for cleaning and other works at these gardens and islands. Unless board ropes in other private agencies, it will not be able to maintain these places properly. At some gardens, plants have withered due to lack of maintenance,” a senior board official said.

One of the worst affected structures is the Maratha War Memorial, with its internal and outside premises staying dirty for a long time now.

“We have written to various companies and organizations to maintain the memorial, but they have not responded to the letters yet,” the official added.

Sanjay Kawade, activist and resident of Ghorpadi, said, “Over the years, the board failed to recruit staffers at the garden department. Many of them have retired from the service in the last one decade. If the board has its own staffers, they would not require private help.”

KOLKATA: A teenager’s life was saved after her friend alerted Metro Railway authorities at Kalighat station of her intention to commit suicide around 12.20pm on Thursday. The 19-year-old girl was virtually dragged away from the edge of the platform and taken to the station master’s office minutes before a train was to arrive. After basic counseling, she was handed over to officials of the Kalighat police station, who summoned her parents before allowing her to leave.

“It seems that the girl from Amtala in South 24 Parganas and her male friend from Bankura had an argument at the station over something. Before her friend could stop her, the girl rushed down to the platform threatening to end her life under the wheels of the next train. Her companion then alerted a Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel passing nearby. Without wasting any time, the security personnel rushed down to the platform and rescued the girl,” Metro Railway CPRO Indrani Banerjee said.

Though the girl insisted that she be allowed to leave, station officials didn’t think that she was in the proper frame of mind and informed the local police station. It was around 1.20pm when the police took her away. “We could not risk allowing her to leave alone. She was also not ready to go with her male friend. Finally, we urged her parents to reach the police station and take her away,” an official said.

In the past, lives have been saved after relatives called up the Metro control room to say that a family member has left home in a huff with the intention to commit suicide. This may be the first time when a companion alerted Metro staff of the intention of his companion to take her life within the station premises itself.

Nagpur: Peeved over civic and power entities’ failure over removal of deadly electric poles from roads, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Thursday asked MSEDCL and NMC to sit together and prepare an action plan in this regard which would be implemented with a deadline.

A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote sternly directed both respondents to submit the plan within a week having details of expenditure involved in shifting of poles and for completion of work.

The directives came while hearing a suo motu PIL (No 98/2018) based on TOI’s reports on electric poles standing right in the middle of roads, due to expansion, where Shreerang Bhandarkar is appointed as amicus curiae.

Earlier, the respondents informed that they had spent Rs30 crore so far on shifting the poles from various areas. Both informed that they had additionally deposited Rs5 crore in 2015 with HC registry for poles shifting as directed by the court. When the judges inquired about it from its registry, they were informed that the amount is now accumulated to Rs7.74 crore in five years due to bank interest.

343,['13/03/2020'],"Afforestation, school infra get focus in Corpn budget","Trichy: Trichy corporation has presented a secret budget for the fourth consecutive year, in the absence of an elected council. The corporation on Thursday tabled a Rs 42.65 lakh surplus budget for the financial year 2020-2021. Proposals to grow dense forest through Miyawaki method and develop infrastructure of corporation schools are among the budget’s priorities.

The total revenue is expected to be Rs 1,335.47 crore against an expenditure of Rs 1,335.04 crores. While the revenue in the previous budget (2019-20) was estimated at Rs 767.94 crores, it has surged by 74% in Thursday’s budget, thanks to the smart cities mission and Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut) funds. Unlike the previous budgets which had several fancy announcements that did not materialise, the civic body proposed a limited number of practically executable announcements.

Following the success of Miyawaki forest in Srirangam, Rs 40 lakh has been allotted for dense afforestation in all four zones through the method. The civic body has also proposed to develop a model school each in the four zones at an outlay of Rs 75 lakh a school. State-of-the-art facilities including smart classrooms will be set up in the proposed school, officials said.

“It is a welcome move to spend towards increasing the city’s green cover. Trichy corporation should expand the Miyawaki method of afforestation to all the 65 wards,” K Suresh Kumar, a resident of Raja Colony said. Other proposals from the general fund include expansion of micro compost centres (MCC) to 17 more locations at an estimated cost of Rs 8.87 crore. The decentralised waste collection centres at 32 locations will now collect and recycle the waste within a ward, preventing the waste from heading to the dump yard in Ariyamangalam.

Corporation has also proposed to buy incinerators for all four zones at an outlay of Rs 16 crores. Utilising smart cities mission fund, officials said that the civic body will establish model urinal-cum-toilets at four spots. “Combining the concepts in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM), a public park for children will come up at Panchakarai at an estimated cost of Rs 14.90 crore. It will be named after Trichy-born Nobel prize winner Sir C V Raman,” an official source said.

Chandrapur: The 49-day-long agitation by contract workers of Chandrapur GMCH, under the banner of Janvikas Kamgar Sena (JKS), took an aggressive turn when women agitators blocked the entrance of district collectorate on Thursday afternoon. Police resorted to baton charge on the agitating women, leaving many of them injured.

Over 400 contract workers of Chandrapur GMCH are staging agitation in front of the district collectorate since January 23 to demand minimum wages, payment of pending five month salary, and scrapping of contract and black listing of labour supplier to GMCH.

The president of JKS said medical education minister Amit Deshmukh met guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar and ordered cancellation of the labour supplier’s contract. Dean Dr SS Morey allegedly cancelled the contract on March 8, but did not inform the agitators.

Some 250 women agitators were detained and booked. Congress MLA Pratibha Dhanorkar has demanded cancelling the offences against the women agitators in a letter to home minister Anil Deshmukh.

The delegation, led by the state government’s special representative in Delhi N Thalavai Sundaram included MPs A Navaneethakrishnan, S R Balasubramaniyan, Vijila Sathyananth, N Chandrasekar, S Muthukaruppan, R Vaithilingam, A Vijayakumar and A K Selvaraj and priests.

Kanyakumari MP H Vasanthakumar also raised the issue in the Parliament during the zero hour and sought their repatriation in a special flight. Responding to it, MEA Jaishankar said that the Indian Embassy officials in Iran have got in touch with some of the fishermen and will be contacting the others soon. The minister said that efforts are being taken to ensure that the fishermen are provided with food, water and essential supplies.

President of the international fishermen development trust, Justin Antony made a representation to the minister to deploy more medical teams to test the fishermen along with other Indians in Iran.

“We have been seeking repatriation of fishermen for more than two weeks. The ministry has stated that there are more than 6,000 Indians including about 1,000 fishermen in Iran. The government must send additional medical teams to test them all soon and bring them home,” Antony said.

Sawant urged Modi not to permit Karnataka to divert Mhadei water.

“Modi assured to look into the Mhadei matter and said that he will not allow any injustice to Goa,” Sawant told TOI after he called on the PM in New Delhi on Thursday. Sawant said he explained the chronology of events in the Mhadei matter to the PM. He told the PM that the Mhadei matter is likely to come up in the Supreme Court on July 15, 16 and 22. “Until the SC’s final hearing, the Union government should not give permission to Karnataka to start construction for diverting Mhadei waters,” Sawant told the PM.

On March 6, Sawant urged the Jal Shakti ministry and the environment ministry not to permit Karnataka to carry out any construction on Mhadei till Goa’s side is heard. The opposition had said that the meeting was just an eyewash and the chief minister should have met the PM and explained Goa’s stand as it is linked to different ministries.

On March 2, the SC had rejected Goa’s plea to stop Karnataka from starting work on the Mhadei, but said Karnataka can begin construction only after getting permission from the Centre, and preparation of a detailed project report (DPR). A day later, Sawant had said that the state would approach the Centre and request them not to permit Karnataka to start any work on its projects on the Mhadei.

347,['13/03/2020'],Political parties start preparationsfor election,"Jaipur: Dates for elections to six municipal corporations in the state have been announced and preparations have begun in both the political parties for the municipal body elections announced on Thursday.

While the Congress is still in the planning stage, the BJP has already appointed its workers in the city to supervise the municipal wards and shortlisted probable candidates who are active in their respective areas. As per the information provided by the BJP members, they have divided Jaipur in different levels.

BJP sources said that as per the 10 state assembly areas, Jaipur has been divided into 33 mandals. In every state assembly area, there can be five to three mandals and in each mandal, there can be 4 to 6 wards. At the top level, Vidhan Sabha Prerak has been appointed by the party followed by Mandal Prerak under him. The work of the Mandal Prerak is to get information about caste equation, influential voters and powerful families of the ward.

One BJP member, who didn’t want to be named said, “Everything has been planned and the work has been divided. Unofficially, we have been asked to prepare a list of influential people in the ward who can be given tickets, to figure out the Congress vote bank in the ward and to chalk out strategies to break their vote bank. A voters’ list will be prepared for the number of people residing outside the district or ward.” People have already started approaching the district heads of political parties to secure a ticket for the upcoming elections.

Both the parties are, however, certain that the OBC women mayors in both the corporations will be chosen from the already active members in their women’s wing. “There are no active women OBC members in the city but we are trying to give tickets to women members active in the party in our women’s wing. It will make much sense. Within a few days, it will be clear,” said one Congress member.

348,['13/03/2020'],"Coronavirus hits travel plans in Delhi, leaving backpackers’ haven in despair","NEW DELHI: It is well near impossible to take a relaxed walk through Paharganj in central Delhi. The area packs in tourists on a shoestring budget and walking there means weaving through an obstacle course of human beings from across the globe. On Thursday, however, there was a relaxed air in the usually crowded backpacker’s haven. The lanes looked uncharacteristically accommodating because there weren’t many people around.“Sorry, I have a bus to catch,” a foreigner in his 20s smiled. The smile did not hide the wariness in his tone. Like him, most masked tourists refused to talk to TOI. Those who did expressed keenness to leave the city. A Turkish family explained through a translator app that they were leaving Delhi on Friday. They didn’t want to be named or photographed. The travellers surely realise that they are as much at risk of infection by the novel coronavirus in their parts of the world as in Paharganj, but the travel restrictions announced by various countries, including India, must have been playing on their minds.A group from Kazakhstan has been trapped by such restrictions. Vishal Narang, who owns a few hotels in the locality, told of the plight of the 25-odd Kazakhs. “Their flights stand cancelled till March 21. They were staying at Pearl Plaza hotel from March 5 but have run out of money. We are providing them food,” Narang disclosed. TOI tried reaching out to these stranded tourists, but they declined to talk.A few, however, are enjoying their time in Delhi despite the anxieties. Russel Shakespeare, a resident of Brisbane, Australia, was nonchalantly ambling along with Sidney resident Michael Amendolia. The unmasked Shakespeare explained, “Unless it’s a P95 mask, there’s no point in wearing one. The only precaution we are taking is washing our hands and using hand sanitisers.” The duo came to India for two week and are returning home on Friday, having spent most days in Varanasi.“I haven’t noticed anything yet to panic about,” Shakespeare said. Amendolia revealed that the two, both photographers, had been eating in dhabas to experience Indian food. “There are worse diseases we could contract,” the 57-year-old reasoned. “We are, of course, very careful about the general hygiene of the place where we eat.”Ajay Kumar Aggarwal, president, Paharganj’s Hotel Mahasangh, said the panic and restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic had cut into their earnings. “This is a 100% occupancy season, but we are seeing not more than 20% occupancy,” Aggarwal said glumly.Pawan Mittal, general secretary of the association, elaborated, “February and March are completely ruined. At this time, apart from tourists, importers, exporters and medical tourists arrive in Paharganj. Now the visa process is on hold till April 15 and even those who are here are hurrying home,” Mittal claimed.Paharganj’s 800 hotels are jittery because the domestic tourist season in April-June too is likely to be hit. Bookings are being cancelled and payments are being held back. They are coping with the virus as advised. Mittal revealed that the hotels are sending daily reports to the municipal corporation: “Guests who came after February 15 are under the scanner, especially those who arrived from the virus-affected countries.”At Shimtur, a popular Korean restaurant, manager Hari said all employees had been instructed to wash their hands frequently, though masks hadn’t yet been made mandatory. At Appetite German Bakery the staff use masks and hand sanitisers though there aren’t too many tourists eating there. Cleverly enough, Harish Kumar, who runs Minis Sports and Jeans, compensated for the slump in business by stocking masks and finding ready takers for them.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74603172,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-228304,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/virus-hits-travel-plans-leaving-backpackers-haven-in-despair/articleshow/74602322.cms

KOLKATA: A 33,000-gallon water tank at the Post and Telegraph (P&T) housing quarters, located adjacent to City Centre mall in Salt Lake’s CC Block , collapsed on Thursday morning, triggering panic among the residents of the complex.

Nobody, however, was injured. The residents said that the incident had occurred around 8.45am.

“I was preparing to leave for office. Suddenly, I heard a loud thud with an earthquake-like feeling. We rushed out of our flats and saw the huge water tank had collapsed behind the maintenance office. Water was also gushing out of the tank,” said Satyajit Maji, a resident.

The tank, located near gate number 3 of the housing built in 1978, supplies water to the entire housing complex that has 88 building blocks and 1,056 flats. Residents of the nearby flats also came out, fearing it was an earthquake . “Our buildings were trembling as if there was an earthquake. Many of the buildings are in dangerous condition with large cracks due to the lack of maintenance,” said Shovan Mukherjee, another resident. A telecommunications department official, who came to the spot with department of posts officials, said they were taking all necessary steps to replace the tank and restore water supply in the complex at the earliest.

Bidhannagar mayor Krishna Chakraborty said, “It was a narrow escape for the residents. We have asked the authorities concerned to take urgent steps to restore the water supply as early as possible. We are urging the authorities to look into the condition of the buildings as well.”

Councillor Tulsi Sinha Roy said, “I have never seen any maintenance work taken up by the central government agencies for the housing in the past 10 years. We have repeatedly sent letters to both the postal and telecommunications departments but with no result.” Roy said tankers will be provided till water supply is restored.

The rifles are part of the total order for 6,167 rifles. OFT here has so far supplied around 11,000 TARs to various central and state police forces. The rifles were received by CRPF DIG D S Rawat.

Trichy Assault Rifle was conceived in 2015 and production began at OFT in 2017. TAR, is considered an equivalent variant of AK-47. Compared to stamped sheet metal riveted body in other rifles, TAR features a fully machined receiver body for higher reliability and strength.

After Chhattisgarh state police received the first batch of 200 TARs in March 2017, various state police forces and paramilitary forces placed orders for the rifle. CRPF had conducted evaluation trials of TAR including accuracy and reliability apart from tests such as drop, mud, saltwater immersion and rain tests. The rifle was then subjected to life cycle test in which 15,000 rounds were fired without any single stoppage, proving its reliability. After successful trials, CRPF placed a pilot order for 100 rifles.

After extensive field usage in various terrains including Srinagar, in 2018, CRPF placed the bulk order. CRPF had asked for customised requirements such as upper hand guard with picatinny rail for mounting telescopes and tritium filled luminous sources for night firing capability.

“Our factory has produced several weapons. Among all, TAR is undoubtedly our biggest success,” said Shirish Khare, general manager, OFT.

The ordnance factory here has 17,000 orders for TAR from Border Security Force and Sashastra Seema Bal.

Directorate of local bodies (DLB) issued a notification on Thursday allotting 8,599 posts for the Jaipur Municipal Corporation, Greater and 5,873 posts for Jaipur Municipal Corporation, Heritage.

Both the municipal corporations have already come into existence and after notification of posts have been released, things have become clear. Around 466 posts have been abolished and 210 temporary posts have been created. In all, 14,472 officials will take charge of new corporations.

According to sources, a month back, the municipal commissioner had sent the format to all the section and zonal offices of the corporation. In this, employees and officers have been asked their choices regarding they municipal office they want to work in. Around 70% officials opted for the Jaipur Municipal Corporation, Greater.

The reasons appear to be the fact that most of the areas in the Jaipur Heritage office are of boundary wall and slum area which is disputed. Apart from this, problems like dirt, sewer and traffic congestion are constant issues in the said area. Compared to this, in Jaipur Greater, there is neither such disputed area nor there are more complaints related to cleanliness.

Moreover, for revenue officer there won’t be much work as most of the properties in the Heritage city are not taxable due to their small size. The office of Jaipur Heritage is being built in the old PHQ office in the boundary wall, while the office of Jaipur Greater will remain in the existing corporation headquarters on Tonk Road.

Officials at the JMC said that at first their focus is to get the two municipal corporations start functioning. “Both the municipal corporations have started functioning on paper now with the decision of number of officials the process will soon begin,” said a JMC official.

In October 2015, the environment ministry had issued environmental clearance to the Mopa airport. The EC was suspended by the Supreme Court in March 2019 after activists challenged it.

On January 16, the Supreme Court lifted the suspension on construction of the greenfield airport being developed by the GMR Group, and asked the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) to oversee the project to ensure there is no environmental damage or danger to flora and fauna of the area.

VADODARA: An auto garage owner living in Yakutpura was left shocked after his second wife dumped him for her previous husband and also took with her cash and ornaments worth Rs 2.6 lakh.

Mohammed Shakil Mansuri, who lives near Adaniyapul in Yakutpura, lodged a complaint of cheating against his second wife Iram and her previous husband Salman Shahbuddin at City police station on Wednesday.

According to Mansuri, Iram was not found in the house on February 6 so he checked in the neighbourhood. One of the neighbours told him that he had seen Iram going with a man in the car early in the morning.

Mansuri called her, but her phone was switched off so he suspected that she must have fled with Shahbuddin as she was in touch with him even after the marriage in November last year. On coming back home, Mansuri found out that she had also taken along Rs 1.2 lakh cash and ornaments worth Rs 1.4 lakh with her.

Later, Mansuri went to Shahbuddin’s home at Indore to convince her and bring her back to Vadodara. However, she refused to come with him as she was still fond of Shahbuddin. Mansuri waited for a month as even Iram’s parents tried to talk to her, but when she kept refusing to come to Vadodara, Mansuri approached police.

Cops said that Mansuri married Iram in November as he was not able to have kids from his first wife. “Iram is complainant’s sister-in-law’s daughter and as everyone in the family were fine with the alliance Mansuri and Iram got married at his home in Vadodara,” said a police official.

356,['13/03/2020'],Stray dog sterilisation drive likely to resume in April,"Trichy: The Trichy Corporation and Animal husbandry department have chalked out plans to resume the stray dogs sterilisation drive from April. A meeting conducted recently identified a Trichy-based NGO recognised by Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) to resume the sterilisation drive at the corporation’s Animal Birth Control (ABC) centre at Konakkarai.

Since August 2019, the sterilisation drive at ABC centre was suspended owing to poor sterilisation practice at the centre. Though the civic body had requested NGOs recognised by AWBI to take up the sterilisation process, officials said that none of the NGOs turned up in the last few months.

As the menace of stray dogs was persistently affecting the public, the district administration convened a meeting recently which was attended by social activists, civic body and animal husbandry department.

The credibility of the NGO, their resources and work plan to neuter the dogs shall be verified within a week. Subsequently, the contract to capture, sterilise and return the animals to their respective spots will be awarded to the particular NGO. Authorities said that neutering drive will resume at the earliest since the district administration has involved them in reviving the drive.

“We have sought the NGO to furnish work plan and employees available with them to resume the sterilisation drive. We will provide fund and infrastructure to support the drive to alleviate the sufferings of residents,” an official with the corporation said. The civic body said they sterilised 900 dogs out of 1,400 dogs actually planned in 2019.

The animal husbandry department was requested to furnish the statistics of stray dogs in the city. The population is around 20,000. “Ever since we removed public garbage bins, the population of stray dogs has not increased rapidly,” the official added. Since Trichy Corporation is technically ill-equipped to oversee the neutering process, animal husbandry department is requested to supervise the weekly progress of sterilisation drive.

A top official of the department said that the selected applicants will be required to furnish all the details of the shop and deposit the licences fees and the process will take three to four days.

He said the overall response was very good and the department will seek application for Sriganganagar and Hanuman districts where there were no applications for 89 country liquor shops.

“Unlike in the past few years when applications were sought for six to seven times, we will require just another date for Sriganganagar and Hanumangarh. The date would be most likely March 16,” said the official.

He said that response from districts like Ajmer is very encouraging given the fact that the country’s economy is not doing well and investor sentiment is at lower levels.

But some retailers said that applicants from outside the state were more and they wanted the government should have given preference to the local businessman.

The number of shops this year has remained same that included 1000 for IMFL and 5543 for country liquor.

The department has got application money of Rs 860 crore. Although it is less than the Rs 1007 crore received by the department last year, the official said that whenever the lottery system is conducted for a second consecutive year, the revenues go down.

“That’s why comparing the figures for 2017-18 is appropriate. In that year, the application revenue was Rs 837 crore which is less than the revenue of Rs 860 crore for 2020-21,”he added.

Vadodara: Students and vigilance staff of the MS University (MSU) got into a scuffle at the head office on Thursday morning. The students were demonstrating at the head office over the delay in declaration of results of commerce and other faculties’ exams.

The group led by general secretary of the MSU Students’ Union, Rakesh Panjabi, at one point tried to enter the head office building which led to the scuffle. On one hand students tried to enter, on the other, the vigilance staff and security guards tried to push them away. In the melee, several students including Panjabi were pushed away.

“All we wanted was to either meet the vice-chancellor or registrar or the deputy registrar, but since none of them were coming out, we requested the vigilance staff to allow us to enter the building and meet them,” said Panjabi.

“When they were pushing us away, I requested them that I am the general secretary and the senate member so at least I should be allowed in, but a couple of security guards pushed me away,” he added. Panjabi suffered minor injuries on his hand and was taken to SSG Hospital.

The students claimed that the exams of the odd semester ended on December 15, but even after three months the results had not been declared by the university. “Mid-semester exams of the even semester have been conducted and the final exams will begin in the first week of April. Yet we don’t know our performance of the previous semester,” said a student.

Panjabi said that the results of all the semesters of BCom were being awaited, and the results of some semesters of engineering and technology faculty and arts faculty were still to be declared. “On Friday too we will continue with our protests,” he said.

“We have included additional human resource in completing the process. But assessments as such take time because it is a manual process and commerce faculty has over 15,000 students,” said MSU’s officiating registrar K M Chudasama. He added that by next week the issue would be resolved.

While there were talks of a postponing the convocation planned in BIM, all the 117 students will be finally getting their degrees on Saturday. BIM was started in 1984 as a school of excellence and registered as a society in partnership with Bharat Heavy Electrical Limited (BHEL). Set up on the BHEL campus, it made changes to the bylaws, which virtually cut off BDU’s role in BIM.

“While it was governed by a council of which the BDU vice-chancellor was a member, his membership was removed following changes to the bylaws in 2011,” said a senior faculty member of BDU.

However, the degree has been issued by BDU every year since its inception. According to highly placed sources, this year BDU had written to the state government saying it will not sign degrees this year as BIM had not complied with the norms by not allowing academic and financial audit.

According to the original bylaws, BDU has serious role in the academic activity which the BIM under the directorship of Karuthiah Pandian refuses to acknowledge. BDU registrar G Gopinath told TOI that there was a communication gap between BIM and BDU. “BIM has modified some of its bylaws and we wanted clarification. The university has requested the higher education department to give directions on accepting the modified bylaws,” he said.

This being an internal communication and students should not be affected, they had issued the degree certificate of all the 117 students to BIM, he said. In 2011, it made some changes that may not be adhering to the university standards. While it was also not approved by the syndicate, they had sought clarification, he added.

365,['13/03/2020'],Parents of kids with rare diseases join hands to form awareness network,"Kolkata: Dilip Singh and wife Prity were heart-broken when their son was detected with a rare genetic disorder for which there was no cure. That was about three and a half years ago. The couple later not only picked up pieces to give the best care to their eight-year-old son but also formed a network of parents, whose children are grappling with rare diseases. Giving them constant boost is the Organisation for Rare Diseases India ( ORDI ).

“My wife gave up her financial sector job and I chose a job profile that is less demanding so that we could take care of our son. Luckily, we can afford his medication. But there are many parents who cannot. That’s why we need to have a well-defined policy on rare diseases,” said Singh, a bank employee.

Singh’s son suffers from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy ( DMD ), a condition in which there is progressive weakness and loss of skeletal and heart muscles. The treatment is done only to lessen the symptoms.

“Doctors told me that my daughter will not survive beyond a month. Though everyday is a battle, she is now going to be a year-old. I wish doctors were more informed and had guided us in a better way,” said Ultadanga resident Subhro Das. The state employee’s first child suffers from Edward’s syndrome, a condition in which an extra chromosome disrupts the normal pattern of development in the baby that can be life threatening even before birth.

“Parents like us do not know where to go. And that’s why we formed the network with help of ORDI,” said Pinaki Talukdar, whose son suffers from DMD. Everything was fine with Talukdar’s son till the age of five. Today at 12, he depends on wheelchair for movement and a bi-pap for breathing assistance. To raise awareness, ORDI has come up with Racefor7 , a multi-city run/walk in 20 cities, including Kolkata. “The state too has taken up a proactive approach by forming a task force,” said Dipanjana Datta, state coordinator for ORDI.

The Pocso rules became effective from March 9.

The rules specify that state governments must formulate a child protection policy based on the principle of zero-tolerance to violence against children, which shall be adopted by all institutions, organisations, or any other agency working with children. The provision comes on the back of recent cases of child sexual abuse in child care institutions, including in Muzaffarpur in Bihar and Deoria in UP.

Laying out the detailed modalities for reporting of pornographic material involving a child, the rules state that ""any person who has received any pornographic material involving a child or any information regarding such pornographic material being stored, possessed, distributed, circulated, transmitted, facilitated, propagated or displayed, or is likely to be distributed, facilitated or transmitted in any manner shall report the contents to the special juvenile police unit (SJPU) or police, or the cyber-crime portal"".

375,['13/03/2020'],Temp drops by 3 degrees as cool northerly wind blows,"A motorcyclist cruises down Jangli Maharaj Road near College of Engineering ground on Thursday

PUNE: The minimum temperature in the city plunged to the season's second lowest at 14.4°C in Shivajinagar on Thursday after the re-emergence of the northerly wind flow.

The lowest night temperature in March when the pre-monsoon season began this year was 13.7°C recorded in Shivajinagar on March 4.

A senior India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientist told TOI that the northerly wind flow has begun in the lower atmospheric level and is likely to continue till March 15. Night temperatures are thus likely to hover between 14°C and 15°C till Saturday in Pune.

“Even day temperatures in the city are on the lower side because we have the cold, northerly wind component entering Pune during the day time along with partly cloudy skies. Both factors have caused a significant dip in day temperatures which have plunged below normal by over 4 degrees celsius,” he said.

On Thursday, the day temperature in Shivajinagar was 31°C, around 4.4°C below the normal while it was 31.7°C in Lohegaon, 4.3 degrees below the normal. Lohegaon’s minimum temperature early on Thursday was 16.5°C .

Nashik, Shivajinagar and Mahabaleshwar recorded the lowest minimum temperatures in Maharashtra on Thursday. The lowest was in Nashik at 14.2°C, while Mahabaleshwar’s minimum was the same as Shivajinagar’s.

The IMD on Thursday said maximum temperatures have been appreciably below normal (-3.1°C to -5.0°C) at a few places over West Madhya Pradesh, Madhya Maharashtra, Marathawada , Chhattisgarh and Telangana, among others.

Almost all locations in Maharashtra are recording below normal day temperatures, the highest negative departures being witnessed in Jalgaon, Pune, Nashik, Osmanabad , Aurangabad and Chandrapur .

377,['13/03/2020'],Youth told to keep off drug-alcohol mix and ganja,"Trichy: Asking students to keep off drugs, A Venkadesh Babu, assistant commissioner, Central Bureau of Narcotics, Chennai, said a new trend of mixing alcohol with a prescription drug is picking up among youngsters.

“While this gives an overwhelming level of intoxication, it is equally harmful,” he said while addressing students at St Joseph’s College Trichy on Thursday. Delivering a talk on “Drugs and Addictions”, he said alcoholics often increase their alcohol intake over a period as they find the intoxication insufficient. This could perhaps be a reason for such trend picking up as the level of intoxication is overwhelming when sedatives or pain medication is mixed with alcohol. But it can slow the heart rate leading to death,” he said.

Saying that Indians are psychologically addicted to prescription than drugs, he said people even deem a doctor unfit if he or she refers for tests than giving medicines. But deaths caused by legal drugs (prescription drugs) are more in number than those caused by drugs the world over. He said these drugs are poison if taken beyond a limit consistently.

Citing his previous interactions with college students, he said there is an advocacy especially among students that cannabis can be taken as it’s a natural product and there are no harmful effects. “One of the students asked why cannabis are not legal in the country unlike western countries, but I told him that ganja cannot be good for healthy living. There is misconception among youngsters over its usage,” he said.

“Over three-decade-long research finding reveals that ganja abuse will lead to intellectual and physical disability apart from affecting IQ level up to 8 points. Hallucinations and dependency are other ill-effects,” he said. He asked students to stay connected with parents and friends which will keep them away from evils.

The police managed to nab the accused during the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday.

Police said the accused was a seaman and had come to Goa recently. On Wednesday afternoon, while the survivor was walking home from school, he offered her a lift on his motorcycle. As he was an acquaintance, the survivor didn’t suspect anything amiss and accepted his offer. However, instead of dropping her home, police said he took her to a hillock in distant Ambaulim, near Quepem, and raped her.

As the girl had failed to return home from school, a missing person’s report was filed at the Maina-Curtorim police station and a case of kidnapping registered .

“A massive search operation was conducted around the place where the girl was last seen. Late Wednesday evening, the survivor was found in an unconscious state on the hillock by locals of Ambaulim and had injuries on her body. While she was shifted to hospital, movements of all suspects in the area were checked. Several suspects were rounded up and finally the accused was nabbed from his house. He later confessed to the crime,” South Goa SP Arvind Gawas told reporters.

The accused, Gawas said, assaulted her and even banged her head on the ground after she tried to resist his advances. As the victim became unconscious, he abandoned her and fled the scene.

The man was arrested under provisions of the Indian Penal Code, Goa Children’s Act and Protection of Children against Sexual Offences Act and remanded in 10 days’ police custody.

Work on the project was stopped on January 27 after the large bamboo scaffolding erected there collapsed injuring one labour.

Ever since the incident took place, the VMC and the agency that have taken up work are involved in hectic discussions over the issue of stopping traffic on the road for resuming work there. Till the January 27 incident, traffic was stopped only on one lane on the road under the dome while work was conducted by erecting scaffolding on the remaining portion.

According to VMC officials, the complete closure of work has been sought by the contractor to ensure that the work on fixing aluminium composite panels on the ceiling of the dome is completed in time. On the other end, VMC officials are wary that closing the road completely would throw traffic out of gear and create chaos on the Old Padra Road where work on the longest flyover in the state has already led to traffic woes.

Officials added that they were already holding meetings with the traffic branch of the city police to find alternate routes and regulate traffic if it was absolutely necessary to close the traffic. Sources said that technology to conduct work using cranes and other means was available, but this was a costly affair and not viable.

It said instead of “merely issuing advisories”, the government must “do a little more” to evacuate over 3,000 Indian nationals, including pilgrims, fishermen and students, stranded in Iran.On its part, Centre said that mass evacuation was not possible as Iran had banned all commercial flights from February 26. Secondly, the Centre said, those stranded had to be tested for the fast spreading virus before they could be brought back to the country.The government admitted there was no local support on the ground from Iranian authorities and it took several rounds of negotiations before Indian scientists were allowed to set up a lab there to draw samples from Indian citizens.The Iranian government only recently allowed an Indian Air Force aircraft to evacuate 58 nationals, including 25 women and two children, the central government stated.Assuring the court that the local embassy was in contact with Indian nationals in Iran and advisories had been issued to them on following the health protocols issued by WHO, the government said that embassy officials were travelling to all the locations where Indians were stranded to assure them of all possible assistance for their safe and early return.The court, however, remarked that merely issuing advisories was not going to help. “You know where students are.

Four cause mild diseases, including 15% of upper respiratory infections (URIs). Covid-19 is different. It is more contagious and less deadly than SARS and MERS, the number of cases were in the few thousands and mortality rates were 10-11% for SARS and 37% for MERS. As of now, Covid-19 has more than a lakh known cases across the globe and mortality rates of 2% to 4%, depending on the country,” said Dr Madan.She added that the virus is thought to spread through droplets and there is no evidence to show it can spread through the air. “It is thus advised that one should keep a distance of about six feet from an infected person. About 99% of cases manifest in two to 14 days of infection,” she said.The World Health Organization (WHO) has already declared Covid-19 a pandemic, due to its global spread.

Baring a few weddings that had been booked much earlier, all other events including corporate meetings, conferences, and exhibitions have been cancelled.They said that the domestic visitors, who account for a large pie of the total business, have also stopped travelling, resulting in a sharp decline in hotel occupancies.“The worst fears are coming true. The situation is not far from being panic. The dramatic decline in occupancies shows that. Even people are increasingly avoiding to dine out.

That includes letting some people go till the situation improves. While big chain hotels have not gone for job cuts as yet, they are not hiring temporary staff,” said a general manager of the hotel.Manpower expenses as percentage of total operating costs have been rising in the past few years.

“Manufacturers are getting far more orders than usual and they have had to step up production. I can assure you that there is no mask shortage for doctors and health workers. However, they will not be able to match this unusually high demand from the public,” said K Manoharan, president, Tamil Nadu Chemists and Druggists Association. He also said that the association has asked manufacturers to double check actual requirement before catering to unusually high bulk orders even from hospitals. “For work purposes, I have to visit hospitals sometimes and keep some masks in hand. During the past few weeks, I went to a couple of pharmacies and found that they sold masks for up to Rs 30 apiece, which cost below Rs 10 before,” said a salesperson from Anna Nagar.

Pharmacists and pharmaceutical associations have urged customers, including public, doctors, hospitals and clinics to buy responsibly to avoid causing a shortage of masks to those who really need it. They said the cost of mask has actually more than doubled not just because of demand and supply but also because of the increased manufacturing costs. “We are trying to strictly regulate and are insisting on a uniform affordable price for surgical masks to around Rs 14-21 depending on the type and quality. We are taking measures to ensure masks shortage is prevented and is affordable,” said C Manohar, founder-secretary, Madurai Mavatta Marunthu Vanigargal Sangam.

Some may pass off low quality mask as higher quality one at a higher cost” .

388,['13/03/2020'],"DMK, ruling party cross swords over public exams for Class V, VIII","Chennai: The state government may have scrapped its move to hold public exams for Class V and Class VIII but the issue became a point of debate between the opposition DMK and ruling AIADMK during the demand for grants for school education and higher education departments in the assembly on Thursday.

While former minister and DMK MLA K Ponmudi gave credit to his party which “forced the government to back off” from conducting the exams, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami said it had to be scrapped because of the defamatory campaigns of the opposition.

Continuing his speech, Ponmudi said if the exams were conducted there would be more dropouts and rural students would be affected. To this, chief minister said the rural students needed to be prepared for competitive exams on a par with urban students.

The DMK member also brought to the attention of the minister the increase in school dropouts in Classes IX and X in the state as per the data submitted in Parliament by the HRD minister. To this, school education minister K A Sengottaiyan said there were many inconsistencies in the data prepared by the Union government.

Another DMK MLA J L Eswarappan said the revised textbooks, for Class 1XII for instance, were heavier and teachers were not able to complete the syllabus. As per the existing calendar, teachers were short of 31 days for volume 1 and 34 days for volume 2.

Minister Sengottaiyan accepted that the books were heavier. “The text books were revised based on the inputs from the experts committee. We have formed a committee to review the textbooks. Whatever the shortfalls in the present books will be rectified the next year,” he said.

“Like giving formula one car to a Maruti car driver, the state government has handed over the revised textbooks to the teachers without training them. Teachers are not able to understand the lessons and students are not aware of even the basic topics,” the DMK MLA said.

The chief minister interrupted and said education could be provided based on current standards. “You are opposing Class V and VIII board exams and not allowing students to improve their standards. We are seeking your cooperation to improve the standard of education and the government is open to suggestions,” he informed the house.

When the DMK member pointed out that not one among 19,666 students trained at the government sponsored coaching centres was able to get MBBS seat last year, Sengottaiyan said private school students were spending more money for NEET coaching. “We will shortlist 3,000 students for 35 days’ residential coaching. We are confident that at least 100 students from government schools would get medical seats this year.”

The boys from Sivaganga district, who were siblings, had been herding around 200 goats belonging to Koori Murugan, 33, of Odaikulam Kadaladi in Ramanathapuram district.

Murugan had hired the boys, aged 13 and 12 years, for Rs 45,000 and Rs 35,000 respectively, revenue officials said. The boys’ parents were constructing a house. As they had no money to continue the construction work, they sent the boys to herd the goats of Murugan after receiving money from him. The couple have four boys and two daughters.

The herd owner took the boys to Orathanadu in Thanjavur district. Three months ago, the boys were taken to Aravathur village near Valangaiman in Tiruvarur district. A villager called Childline 1098 to inform officials about the boys working as bonded labourers. Childline officials alerted Tiruvarur revenue divisional officer (RDO) S Jayaprithaa.

As per the instructions of the RDO, a team comprising Valangaiman tahsildar, district child protection officer, revenue inspector, Aravathur VAO and labour officials was formed to rescue the boys.

“We monitored the boys for a day and rescued them on Tuesday night when they returned to their camp. After interrogation with the boys, we took them to the RDO on Wednesday”, district child protection officer P Selvaraj said.

390,['13/03/2020'],Travel agents worried over TCS,"Vadodara: Travel agents from the state are a harried lot these days. Already reeling under poor business due to coronavirus scare, the union government proposal of tax collected at source (TCS) has only added to their woes.

TCS that will be applicable for all the foreign travellers from April 1 this year.

“Our business is already suffering due to coronavirus scare. Those travelling abroad are now cancelling their plans and flight tickets too are getting costlier. In the coming months, the foreign bookings will shrink further,” said Bimal Mehta, former chairman of All India Domestic Tour Operators of India, Gujarat chapter.

“Due to TCS, the customers will have to pay an additional 5% on their travel cost apart from the5% GST. This will inflate their travel budget. The government has said that the 5% TCS will be refunded to the traveller when he or she files IT returns,” Mehta told TOI.

“But that is probably only for those who opt for older rebate scheme,” he added.

“TCS will not just affect the foreign travelling bookings but also increase lot of work for travel agents as we will have to take PAN card of the client and file all compliances with the government. It is additional work and smaller agencies don’t have such mechanism to deal with such compliances,” said Reena Gami, a Vadodara-based travel agent.

Mehta, who is a travel agent based in Ahmedabad, said added that the federation of travel agents associations have presented their case to the government. Travel agents across the country too have taken to twitter and are running a trend #savetravelindustry appealing the government to defer TCS till Coronavirus scare subsides.

KOLKATA: Police came to the rescue of at least three examinees who had either forgotten their admit cards or landed in wrong examination centres on the first day of Higher Secondary examinations. Like the Madhyamik examinations, cops deputed more men on roads who helped students reach their examination centres without any trouble.

Musmida Khatun, a student of Ultadanga United High School, reached her examination centre, Banipith Girls High School located on Canal West Road, leaving behind the admit card at her Udayanpally home in Salt Lake’s Mahisbathan.

K C Debnath, sub-inspector of Maniktala PS, who was on duty at the centre, noticed the girl standing anxiously outside the school. He alerted the OC about the matter immediately.

“Prompt initiative was taken by Debnath to ensure Khatun’s entry into the examination centre. He also made arrangements to get her admit card from home and handed it over to the exam invigilator,” said DC (ESD) Ajoy Prasad.

In the other incident, Amit Sengupta, additional OC of Beliaghata police, found HS examinee Salma Khatoon crying in front of Kamala Vidya Mandir School, barely 20 minutes before the examination. The student of Baitulmal High School told him that she had reached there by mistake while her examination centre was Desbandhu Girls Vidyapith at Narkeldanga. Sengupta took the help of Rakhi Das, a civic volunteer, and sent the girl to the centre in his own vehicle.

In the third incident, a student reached Dum Dum’s Kumar Ashutosh Institution (Auxiliary) instead of Ashutosh Institution (Main). Cops took him to the actual examination centre on a bike.

During the Madhyamik, there were seven instances where cops helped candidates get their admit cards.

PUNE: A private contractor (73) appointed to cut the branches of trees on the MSRTC depot premises on Shankarsheth Road was arrested on Wednesday on the charge of completely chopping down 27 trees.

The incident occurred between February 20 and 29.

The private contractor, Ravindra Sawale, will remain in police custody remand till Friday.

An officer from the Swargate police said Sawale was called for questioning and was arrested after he admitted to his involvement in getting the trees chopped.

“The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) had sought permission from the Pune Municipal Corporation ’s tree authority to cut the branches of the trees on the depot’s premises, three months ago. The branches were posing danger to passers-by,” senior police inspector Bramhanand Naikawadi from the Swargate police station told TOI.

“The PMC gave permission to MSRTC officials to cut the branches of the old trees. But, they could not be cut within the time limit because of a dearth of workers. The MSRTC then got the time limit extended from the PMC and the contractor started the work,” Naikawadi said.

“The MSRTC officials had explained to the contractor that the branches were in dangerous condition and needed to be cut. The contractor and his staff illegally chopped 27 trees and transported the logs,” Naikawadi said.

He added that they had seized logs of eight trees from Sawale. “A police team has been fanned for arresting the labour contractor,” he said.

The trees included Ashoka, Gulmohar, Almond, among others.

An MSRTC official Vijay Krishna Redekar (51) of Wadgaon Budruk had registered an FIR against the contractor and his staff on March 7, under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Forest Act.

AHMEDABAD: Congress MLA Natha Patel on Thursday moved the Gujarat high court to save his voting right for the March 26 Rajya Sabha polls in the state for four seats.

In his petition, Patel claimed his voting right might be taken away at the behest of the ruling BJP ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls. Patel’s petition came up for hearing before a division bench comprising Justices J B Pardiwala and Bhargav Karia, but the judges recused themselves, saying “not before me”. Now, it is expected that HC Chief Justice Vikram Nath will allot a new court on Friday to hear the plea.

The MLA from Dhanera in Banaskantha district became apprehensive about his voting right after a local BJP leader, Mukesh Thakkar, recently filed an application before the collector, claiming Patel had concealed “many things” while filing his affidavit for the 2017 assembly election. Thakkar, in his application, prayed that Patel be disqualified as an MLA under section 125 of the Representation of the People Act.

Upon getting the application some time back, Banaskantha collector Sandip Sagale ordered the local police as well as the returning officer of Dhanera to initiate an investigation and take necessary steps, said the petition.

Patel claimed the BJP is trying to reduce Congress votes to stop the opposition party from winning a second seat in the Rajya Sabha elections. The plea urged the court to issue a “writ of prohibition” against the collector’s past orders, claiming he does not have such powers to initiate an inquiry. According to the current equations in the house, the BJP and the Congress will get two seats each as 37 votes are required to win one seat. agencies

CHENNAI: Deputy leader of opposition S Durai Murugan created a flutter in the assembly on Thursday by demanding that street dogs be culled as they pose danger to people. With hundreds of dogs on streets across the state, people were not able to even walk freely, he said.

“If there were 10 to 20 dogs in an area earlier, now there are more than 100. In some areas, there are more than 200 street dogs. There could be rabid ones among them. To ensure safety of people, they need to be put to sleep,” said Durai Murugan.

Leader of the opposition M K Stalin and his senior colleagues seemed surprised over Durai Murugan’s demand. Many laughed at the idea. State health minister C Vijaya Baskar responded saying street dog population was under control. “Unlike the past when we all were threatened with 14 injections around our stomach if we were bitten by a dog, now there are better treatment options. Vaccines are available and all hospitals across the state are equipped to treat people with dog bites,” said the minister.

He said animal husbandry ministry was spaying street dogs to ensure birth control. “We are taking efforts to keep street dog population under control. There have been no human casualty owing to dog bite in recent times. People need not be unduly worried,” minister said.

Tambaram MLA S R Raja said Peerkankaranai government hospital did not have medicines for dog bites and wanted the minister to provide medicines in all hospitals on a war footing. Raja also demanded upgrading of the hospital with more doctors, nurses and equipment.

There are more than 1,000 fireworks industries in and around Sivakasi in which over 5 lakh workers are employed directly and indirectly.

Following charges of environmental pollution by the units, production was banned and later the industries were allowed to manufacture ‘green fireworks’ which were developed by CSIR-NEERI which emit less smoke and do not contain banned chemicals such as lithium, antimony, mercury, arsenic and lead.

A petition filed in Supreme Court on March 3 stated that banned chemicals were being used by manufacturers in Sivakasi. Following this, the apex court directed the CBI to inspect the industries. The team of CBI officials, including two ADSPs, a DSP and 14 CBI officials, went in seven groups and conducted the searches. Many of the units declared a holiday due to the search.

Solanki’s name was included late in the evening, after reports that the party would nominate former chairman of the Indian Premier League (IPL) Rajeev Shukla from Gujarat drew strong opposition from Solanki’s camp.

With a view of the political crisis in Madhya Pradesh, with the defection of Jyotiraditya Scindia to the BJP, Gohil offered to withdraw his name to silence dissent that could have triggered a rebellion ahead of the high-stakes RS election on March 26. The party leadership chose to withdraw Shukla’s name instead and replaced him with Solanki.

Rajeev Shukla later tweeted thanking the Congress for offering the RS nomination from Gujarat. “... But currently, I am focussing on organizational work so requested her (Sonia Gandhi) to nominate some other person,” Shukla tweeted.

""Senior MLAs from Gujarat reiterated they would not accept any outsider candidate marring chances of local leaders like Bharatsinh Solanki and Arjun Modhwadi,"" said a top Congress leader. “... I come from Gandhi’s Gujarat and my dharma is to fight Godse worshipping central government that does not believe in justice, equality and democracy,” Gohil tweeted.

Earlier in the day, drama erupted as news spread that the party leadership had proposed Gohil and Shukla as its RS candidates.

Senior Congress MLAs such as Baldevji Thakor, C J Chavda, Pravin Maru and 20 MLAs made a representation to Gujarat unit president Amit Chavda, rooting for Solanki. They expressed their displeasure over the phone to senior leader Ahmed Patel, about the party giving preference to ‘outsider’ candidates like Shukla over local leaders like Solanki.

Baldevji Thakor, said, “We expressed our anguish over Rajiv Shukla’s proposed nomination. He is a national leader but we need to give prominence to local leaders having a mass base.”

BJP likely to field third candidate

Gandhinagar: After the formal nomination of two senior Congress leaders — former Gujarat Congress president Bharatsinh Solanki and former leader of opposition Shaktisinh Gohil — as the party’s Rajya Sabha candidates, the BJP decided it would put up a fight and field a third candidate, despite being certain of winning only two seats. BJP had held three of these four seats, but due to its fewer MLAs in the 2017 assembly elections, it is six votes short of securing the third seat. It is now hoping to get support from three MLAs of other parties support and ‘poach’ MLAs from the Congress.

Water supply to the affected areas will be curtailed for about a week.

While other work on the water Nimeta water treatment plants had been completed by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), the replacement of valves in plant number three at the facility was pending. The civic body is looking to replace 28 valves in various parts of the plant at a cost of around Rs 18lakh.

Work on the replacement of the valves will begin on Friday and is expected to continue for about a week. The VMC, however, has not announced a deadline for completion of work in a public notice announcing the water cut.

The water cut, sources said, may be only for about five minutes a day. But the affected areas will also be getting water with low pressure. A population of around seven lakh people is likely to be affected.

Water supply to areas under the network of Manjalpur, Kapurai, Tarsali, Jambuva, Makarpura GIDC (new), Nalanda, Panigate and Gajrawadi tanks will be affected due to the work at Nimeta. Apart from these localities under the network of Danteshwar, Makarpura, Somatalav, Sankheda Dashalad and Mahanagar booster tanks will also be affected.

The Nimeta water filtration facility has been marred in a major controversy after it came to light that there were several lacunae in its maintenance. This had led to supply of turbid and yellow coloured water to the southern and eastern parts of the city for several months last year.

The civic body had suspended senior engineers as well as slapped notices to contractors regarding the state of affairs. It had come to light that the design of the plant was faulty and there were serious lapses in its maintenance too. Work had to be taken up on a war footing to fix things at the plant and restart the water supply.

An official in RTDC said that the March 11 journey will be last trip of the season.

The fear of corona virus has triggered large-scale cancellations and impacted its bookings, and on March 8, TOI had reported that the luxury train run by RTDC along with Indian railways has cancelled three trips of the season that ends in April 29.

The train runs once in every week from Delhi during the tourist season (September to April) and currently seven more trips are left. “About 80% of the passengers in the train are people from outside the country, and the visa suspension means that we cannot run the train this season,” said the official.

Mostly travel agents book the cabins in the train paying in advance. Since passengers are cancelling, the agents want the government to at least shift the trips to next year, as in that case they will not have to book losses. “Rajasthan government can take a call on that. As of now, there is no decision on that and the prevailing refund rules are followed,” said the official.

The tariffs for the 7 nights and 8 days trip range from Rs 2.73- 7.56 lakhs, inclusive of everything that includes food, sightseeing, safari, etc. After starting from Delhi, POW takes tourists to Jaipur, Sawai Madhopur (Ranthambore), Chittaurgarh, Udaipur, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Bharatpur, and Agra before returning to the national capital.

404,['13/03/2020'],Can Godavari be linked to Cauvery?,"Chennai: After four decades of court battles over inter-state sharing of Cauvery river water, Tamil Nadu is now pinning its hopes on the Godavari-Cauvery inter-linking to meet its future requirements. Ahead of assembly polls, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami is propping this up as the big development project and extending an invite to his counterparts in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh for talks.

While the high-profile meet could take place as early as April-end, obstacles lie at every turn for the ambitious project . The blueprint was drawn after a hydrological analysis by the Union Jal Shakti ministry that revealed there is surplus of 429 thousand million cubic feet (tmcft) at Manibhadra (Mahanadi basin) and 530tmcft at Polavaram ( Godavari basin).

To tap into the surplus, nine links have been planned under peninsular river component connecting Mahanadi, Godavari, Krishna, Pennar, Cauvery, Vaigai and Gundar. While a substantial quantum from Himalayan rivers could be diverted to Mahanadi, the first leg of peninsular component, Mahanadi-Godavari link, may not materialise. One of the issues is that work on the proposed storage reservoirs at Manibhadra on Mahanadi and Inchampalli on Godavari could not be taken up by the co-basin states in view of floods.

So talks are on for the next leg, that proposes to divert 247tmcft from Godavari to Krishna, and further down to Cauvery. There are three routes being identified between Godavari and Krishna. But its implementation is under a cloud. Sample this: The Centre sent the draft detailed project report to all nine states, including Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka in March last year. ""But states like Telangana, Odisha, Kerala and Union territory of Puducherry are yet to send their comments. Chhattisgarh is objecting to the proposal,"" said a ministry official. The Telangana government built barrages at Sundilla, Annaram, Medigedda – to harness Godavari river water under its Rs80,000 crore Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation project last year, which could have disturbed Chhattisgarh.

But water managers are eyeing the diversion of unused waters on the Chhattisgarh side from Indravati river, tributary of Godavari, for diversion to Pennar and Cauvery. This diversion will help improve water supply in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. As per the draft report, Godavari (Inchampalli)-Cauvery (Grand Anicut) link will offer Telangana 66tmcft, Andhra Pradesh 81tmcft and Tamil Nadu 83tmcft.

In Andhra Pradesh, the Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government is showing ""great interest"" in implementing irrigation schemes. It revoked the previous contract of erstwhile TDP government and chose a new bidder, Megha Engineering and Infrastructure for the mega Polavaram irrigation project on the Godavari. In October, Jagan announced another diversion of Godavari water from Polavaram dam to Banakacherla head regulator at Rs60,000 crore. ""The Centre plans to divert some water from Polavaram that drains into sea, for the Godavari-Cauvery link. This will enhance the supply to Tamil Nadu to 88tmcft. Looks like many of the water problems could be solved if only water is brought under the concurrent list,"" an official said.

In Tamil Nadu, Cauvery is the lifeline. One-third of its population relies on the river for drinking water, irrigation and power. Sources say influential bidders are keen on the meeting of chief ministers of the three southern states for the Godavari-Cauvery link. Though not a direct a beneficiary, Karnataka is equally interested in the project as it will reduce the skirmishes over sharing Cauvery water with Tamil Nadu.

The Centre has set the a deadline of 2022-23 to complete the detailed project reports of the identified 13 of the 16 links in the peninsular component. Study on Tamil Nadu’s request for Pamba-Achankovil-Vaippar link could not be taken up after Kerala’s objections due to environmental issues. A study to link the Netravathi and Hemavathi, a tributary of Cauvery in Karnataka could not be taken up for similar reasons. Only a consensus of the states will ensure the project is not just a pipe dream.

407,['13/03/2020'],NEET-PG aspirant moves HC over quota,"Representative image

MUMBAI: The state government’s policy to apply quota to seats surrendered to the state after the all-India quota admissions for post-graduate medical courses results in a loss of 80-100 seats for open category students every year, aspirants have alleged. A post-graduate aspirant, who appeared for NEET-PG this year, has challenged the policy in court.

In post-graduate courses at government medical colleges, 50% of total seats are reserved for all-India quota. Several seats are vacant under the quota after the second round of counselling, though, as students may prefer their home states over Maharashtra. While these seats are reverted to the state, admission authorities apply state reservations before making these available in the centralized admission process, said Sunil Biyani, father of the aspirant, who moved court.

“In the process, several seats in the open category are lost to reservations. With increased reservations in the state after Maratha quota, very few seats will be left for students in the open category,” said Biyani. His daughter, who appeared for NEET-PG this year, scored an all-India rank above 15,000. The student has moved Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court .

Advocate Shrirang Choudhary said in 2018, around 280 seats from the open category and 80 from the SC and ST category were returned to the state after the second round. “At that time, the government followed 52% reservation in the state, which was then applied to the 360 seats reverted to the state. In doing so, the seats in MD/MS courses shrunk for open category students,” said Choudhary. Dr T P Lahane, director, DMER, said it is the state policy to apply reservations to all seats that are surrendered to them.

CHENNAI: The updation of National Population Register has been put on hold in Tamil Nadu until the state government receives clarifications from the Centre on the three new questions in the form, revenue minister R B Udayakumar said here on Thursday.

He told mediapersons that the state government has notified only the Houselisting Operation as of now. The Union government issued an order for Houselisting Operation, along with updation of NPR for a period of 45 days. It has to be done from April to September this year.

“We have notified only the Houselisting and Housing Census between June 16 and July 30, and there is no notification for updation of NPR. We will take up NPR exercise only when a response is received from the Centre. We have not received it yet,” the minister said.

Union Home minister Amit Shah told Parliament on Thursday that no citizen will be marked ‘D’ or ‘doubtful’ during the updating exercise and no documents are needed to prove citizenship.

Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had sought clarifications on the three additional questions in NPR 2020 format, including mother tongue, place and date of birth of parents and spouses.

Udayakumar said the state had no competence to revoke a Parliamentary law, but the opposition was indulging in false propaganda that NPR required submission of documents.

“We say it again that there is no need for submission of documents for NPR. Enumerator will only register the details provided by the citizen,” he said, reiterating that the NPR exercise was meant for all sections, irrespective of religion and caste. The minister said the states that had passed resolutions in the assembly against NPR too had notified the conduct of NPR exercise in their respective states, including Bihar and Punjab.

Taking a dig at DMK president M K Stalin, who urged the anti-CAA protesters in Washermenpet to remain non-cooperative to the NPR exercise, Udayakumar sought to know how welfare schemes could be evolved and funds could be received if the basic data about the population was not available.

“The opposition and the DMK leader were conspiring to make the minorities scapegoat and earn political gains,” the minister said, adding the AIADMK’s influence among the minorities would not reduce a bit.

The syndicate is expected to take a decision on the alleged graft charges and wrongdoings of controller of examination, O Ravi and a misconduct complaint against a faculty member of a MKU constituent college in Thirumangalam.

The CoE has already submitted his replies to the two charge memos issued by the MKU VC seeking explanation regarding two separate alleged wrongdoings.

The first was with regard to an incident on January 23, where an unauthorised personnel from a distance education centre was found going through consolidated marksheets in the CoE office.

The second was about the issue of November 2019 exam answer sheets being lost and found just before the results were to be announced on February 10. The CoE was also accused of corruption and bribery.

In another instance, a teaching faculty member from an MKU constituent college in Thirumangalam was accused of indulging in unprofessional behaviour by several female faculty and students.

An internal committee was subsequently formed to look into the matter and a report submitted to the VC.

The last MKU syndicate meeting was held on January 29. During that meeting, it was decided to call for a re-advertisement for the post of registrar as all candidates interviewed that day were found unsuitable.

The Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) exam committee will take up the issue at an upcoming internal meeting, said sources.

“We have received numerous complaints from students claiming that the maths paper was very tough. Some of the questions were not part of the curriculum. To ensure that students do not face any injustice, we will look into the matter at our upcoming exam committee meeting.

On Wednesday, many students complained that the mathematics board exam paper was very difficult and that many questions were from outside the course content. Last year, as many as 2.5 lakh students failed in maths exam and the number is expected to go higher this time, subject experts say. Some mathematics teachers who analyzed the question paper claimed it did not follow the blueprint to set papers.

The blueprint suggests that for setting the exam paper, questions with a total weightage of 15% may fall in the ‘tough’ category, which was not the case here, said a mathematics teacher with 20 years of work experience. About one fourth of the paper was tough, he added.

Many parents and teachers also complained that students were asked to solve tough sums that are usually asked in competitive exams like GujCET.

419,['13/03/2020'],"Pune-bound Shivshahi bus catches fire, all on board safe","The bus caught fire at the base of Chandanapuri Ghat.

NASHIK: Twenty-two passengers of the Nashik-Pune Shivshahi bus escaped unhurt when the vehicle caught fire on Thursday morning, thanks to presence of mind shown by the driver, Batu Arjun Ahire.

The alert driver brought the bus to a halt near Chandanapuri ghat in Ahmednagar district soon after noticing smoke coming out of it and told the passengers to get down, MSRTC officials from Nashik division said.

The Ahmednagar division officers of the MSRTC, who will be investigating the incident, said the likely cause of the fire could be short circuit, but an investigation is under way.

The MSRTC officials in Nashik said that the bus started its journey from New CBS in Nashik at 6.15 am. “When the bus approached the base of Chandanapuri Ghat at around 8.30am, after crossing the Sangamner bus stand, the driver noticed smoke coming out from the bus and immediately stopped.”

Driver Ahire quickly de-boarded the passengers and took them to a safe distance from the bus, which was soon engulfed by flames. Two fire tenders rushed to the spot and doused the fire in 15 minutes, but the belongings of the passengers had already been damaged.

The highway police rushed to the spot and took control of the situation, stopping vehicular traffic as a precautionary measure.

“We immediately stopped the movement of vehicular traffic on the opposite side of the road as well. The decision was taken so that the relief and rescue operations were not hampered. An ambulance also rushed to the spot, but fortunately, all the passengers managed to escape unhurt,” said a police officer said.

420,['13/03/2020'],Civil hospital drawing on H1N1 experience to fight Covid-19,"Nashik: The management of the Nashik Civil Hospital is in a much better position to handle the Covid-19 pandemic than it was during the 2009 swine flu outbreak.

The experience that the hospital management had in dealing with swine flu cases is now helping it deal with the new pandemic. The hospital is also much better equipped as the state government has upgraded the medical infrastructure since the swine flu outbreak.

“The experience that the doctors and the para-medical personnel gained in handling swine flu patients is helping us now. Many of those doctors and para medicos are still with us. And they have trained the ones who joined hospital later,” said Nashik civil surgeon Suresh Jagdale.

When the swine flu broke out, the civil hospital initially had 7-8 beds. “Over the years, we increased the number as our staff became trained to handle more patients. Now, even without any confirmed coronavirus case, we have already established a 15-bed isolation ward. We have another 15 beds in reserve,” he said.

The only difference is that there was a prescribed medicine — Tamiflu — for swine flu patients. “But in the case of Covid-19, the doctors have to treat the patients based on symptoms. There is ample stock of such medicines with us,” he added.

The civil hospital has three physicians and one pulmonologist at its disposal. “There are several pulmonologists in private hospitals. We can always fall back on them if need be,” the civil surgeon said. However, the hospital has requested the state government for a more physicians and pulmonologists.

“The immunity among Indians is better. The spread of this virus is manageable. To start with, refrain from touching surfaces and then your nose or mouth. This eradicates 90% chances of catching this infection,” he said.

421,['13/03/2020'],Local IT firm sues Microsoft for trademark violation,"Ahmedabad: A local Information Technology company, Azure Knowledge Corporation, has sued international software giant Microsoft Corporation, complaining that the latter is violating its rights by use of its trademark ‘Azure’.

The local company urged the court to stop Microsoft from infringing on its trademark rights by using the terms ‘Azure’, ‘Microsoft Azure’, ‘Azure Cosmos DB’, ‘Azure Cloud for All’, ‘Azure Sphere’, ‘Azure Brain Wave’ and other words deceptively similar to the registered trademark. It termed Microsoft’s use of the domain name ‘www.azure.microsoft.com’ an infringement and demanded that Microsoft be told to stop using it or to change it.

In response to local company’s suit, a city civil court issued notice to Microsoft last month seeking its reply. The court said it would not be proper to stay the US giant from using the name for its services without first hearing it. Microsoft filed its reply on March 6, stating that it has been using the word for its cloud services platform since 2008, and in India since 2014. Microsoft claimed that it was the prior user of the name in the field of cloud services, a statement from Azure said.

The court granted time till April 4 for both parties to submit their versions and posted a further hearing for April 18 for arguments.

Before Azure moved this court, it had been opposing Microsoft’s use of the word ever since the software giant registered ‘Windows Azure’ as a trademark. Azure filed a rectification petition before the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) seeking cancellation of the registration, claiming exclusive rights to the trademark under certain classes as it first registered it in 1998. In fact, the company has been using this trademark since 1996.

Azure also took exception to the changed logo for Microsoft’s cloud services. “Earlier, Microsoft used a cloud symbol as its logo. Now, it has changed it to the letter ‘A’ which is the logo of our company,” an Azure official said.

422,['13/03/2020'],Hydrogen-CNG buses likely to hit Delhi roads from next month,"A four-tonne per day compact reformer-based HCNG production plant has come up at DTC’s Rajghat-1 bus depot and... Read More

NEW DELHI: Starting next month, buses running on Hydrogen-enriched CNG (HCNG) are likely to hit the capital’s roads. A four-tonne per day compact reformer-based HCNG production plant has come up at DTC’s Rajghat-1 bus depot and is likely to start operations from next month.

HCNG, which is a cleaner fuel compared to CNG, will be used to run 50 Cluster scheme buses as part of a pilot project for six months. The Supreme Court had last year suggested looking at hydrogen-run vehicles as a solution for NCR’s poor air quality and while the technology will take some time to appear in the capital, HCNG could be a step in that direction.

“The plant is ready and is awaiting approval from the Petroleum Explosive Safety Organisation, which comes under the Union ministry of commerce, and approves all gas stations and filling stations,” an official associated with the project said. “The buses that will be run on HCNG would just require some tuning and no major retrofitting,” he added.

In July, Indian Oil Corporation Limited — which has developed the technology to create HCNG — and Indraprastha Gas Limited had laid the foundation stone the plant. According to IOCL, the use of compact reforming process is 30% more cost effective as compared to the physical blending of Hydrogen with CNG.

It was, in fact, a directive of the apex court in July 2018 that led to IOCL and IGL collaborating to put up this first semi-commercial plant as a pilot project for conducting the study on the use of HCNG fuel in 50 BS-IV compliant CNG-run buses in Delhi.

Mixing hydrogen with CNG physically is a difficult proposition and that is why IOCL came up with the compact reforming process, which reforms CNG with no need for mixing. For the pilot project, 50 buses of the Anthony Road Transport Ltd (a cluster scheme concessionaire) will be fed with HCNG and their efficiency and emissions would be recorded for six months run and then submitted to the Supreme Court.

Four tonne of HCNG would be produced at the plant every day and the excess fuel generated would be used to run a generator, which would produce electricity.

But this project is inextricably tied to the last leg of the Godavari-Cauvery project.Only a surplus in the Godavari will support seven districts in the south by diverting 79.5tmcft. ""The Cauvery-Gundar project is estimated to cost Rs8,300 crore. The state is requesting submission of a draft in a week,"" a Jal Shakti ministry official said. If it materialises, the diversion of water will be made during the monsoon months, and the maximum diversion could be 15.5tmcft during December.The Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar link passes through Karur, Trichy, Pudukkottai, Sivaganga and Virudhunagar through a link canal from the Kattalai barrage, upstream of Cauvery. ""This link connecting Cauvery to Gundar serves as a conduit for the transfer of surplus Mahanadi and Godavari waters. Nevertheless, a consensus must be arrived by the states of the peninsular river basins. The existing inter-state agreements for various river basins will have to be reviewed and modified,"" the official said.Faced with the discomfiture of water from Karnataka reservoirs draining into the Bay of Bengal, due to lack of storage in the state, the Edappadi K Palaniswami government is keen on taking up the project. The Tamil Nadu government has been insisting on the ministry to divert water to Kattalai barrage, which is upstream of Grand Anicut for Godavari-Cauvery link, since that would mean easy transfer down south to Vaigai and Gundar rivers. The Centre is studying the option, but the final decision is yet to be taken.Experts say the inter-linking of rivers could diffuse the tensions across the border. For instance, Vaigai river is dependent on water from Mullaperiyar dam, where the state has locked horns with Kerala to raise the storage in the century-old structure to 152ft and store more water. While Kerala wants to build a new Mullaperiyar dam, Karnataka Mekedatu reservoir in the inter-state border.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74605217,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-754507,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/little-signs-of-water-but-state-begins-work-on-rs8300cr-project/articleshow/74602446.cms

FSDL will soon initiate the process of ticket refunds and an announcement will be made through ISL channels,” the organisers stated in a statement.The announcement will come as a huge blow to many travelling fans who had already made arrangements and booked tickets to come to Goa. While league organisers said they understood the sentiment of the fans, they couldn’t put anyone’s health at risk, particularly after advisories were issued by the health and sports ministries.The ISL final will not be the only major football event that is now in danger of being played behind closed doors. The Kolkata derby between Mohun Bagan and East Bengal in the I-League will, almost certainly, also be played without any fan at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan on Sunday.The derby is among the most anticipated clash in Indian football and remains a huge draw. With Mohun Bagan, who won the I-League crown early this week, joining hands with ATK and moving to the ISL next season, Sunday’s derby was being touted as the “final one” in its truest form.“A decision will be taken after consulting the clubs. We understand that the derby is a huge draw but the AIFF cannot go against the directives of the sports ministry. We have two options: either play behind closed doors or postpone the game, which then may be played beyond the end of season,” said one official.There are still four more rounds to be played in the I-League and the All India Football Federation (AIFF) said they would hold a Skype meeting with representatives from all clubs on Friday to decide on the future course. With the sports ministry making it clear that public gathering cannot be allowed for any sporting event, the AIFF may be forced to take drastic measures.The sports ministry guidelines, issued to all national sports federations, states: “You are advised to adhere to the advisories issued by the ministry of health and family welfare and ensure that no public gathering takes place in any sporting event.

In an editorial, Saamna said aging Congressmen pulled out all stops to cut Scindia to size, which prompted him to join the BJP. Congress is an ally in the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in Maharashtra.

Saying that Scindia enjoyed considerable political clout in several parts of Madhya Pradesh, including Gwalior and Guna, Saamna said, “In fact, Scindia was the Congress face during the MP assembly elections. However, party seniors conspired against him while the Congress high command looked on helplessly.”

Stating Scindia’s demands —a Rajya Sabha seat or presidentship of MP Congress Committee—were reasonable, Saamna said the Congress high command should have pacified the millennial leader by accepting one of the demands.

Saamna, though, added Kamal Nath, Congress chief minister of MP, was not an amateur fighter. “He will not give up so easily.”

The work was carried out at a cost of around Rs 29 crore. Though the work was completed months ago, it has not been counted as a completed project.

According to officials, 98% of the work has been completed so far, since a few complaints keep coming. They received a few hundred complaints a day as soon as all the bulbs were replaced with LED a few months ago. But now the number of complaints has been coming down gradually. At present, 10 to 20 complaints are received a day. “We will issue completion certification only after the complaints came down further. Once we received a few hundred calls a day regarding streetlight issues, which has come down to 10 to 20 a day,” an official said.

The project was proposed to bring uniformity to the city in terms of streetlights as there were various kinds of lights emitting different colours.

There are around 53,000 streetlights in the city. As many as 30,500 lights in 72 wards in the core city were replaced with LED bulbs under the scheme. The rest of the lights were already converted to LED streetlights.

435,['13/03/2020'],Delhi to try global player for better HoHo buses,"Launched three months before the Commonwealth Games, the 14 buses ran at a frequency of 30 minutes

NEW DELHI: With its contract with the private operator running Hop-On-Hop-Off (HoHo) buses ending in July this year, Delhi government’s tourism department is mulling to invite global players to run the service in the capital.

Sources said a global tender would soon be called to invite agencies having expertise in running such a facility in other cities of the world to run HoHo bus service in Delhi.

Launched three months before the 2010 Commonwealth Games with 14 buses running at a frequency of 30 minutes, the service failed to live up to the expectations. While the number of buses currently operating has come down to just five, the footfall too has fallen to just about 40-50 people a day.

Though the tourism department had initially planned to procure 25 new buses on its own — some of them double decker with open deck to make it more attractive — and even identified three new routes, sources said the department realised that it was not equipped to run a facility of international standard.

The HoHo service enables tourists to get on and off the bus at different points of their choice. A live commentary is also delivered informing about the site or place in English and Hindi. According to tourism department officials, there are about 35 countries such as Spain (Barcelona and Madrid), United Kingdom (London), United States (Washington DC), Australia (Sydney), Ireland (Dublin), Florence (Italy), and France (Paris) which have a successful HoHo service and Delhi wanted to replicate the same model.

“Delhi has a large number of tourist destinations, some historical and some modern, which cannot be covered by running the facility on just one route. We have worked out three different circuits including one dedicated to 1857 mutiny on which the service would be run. These routes would intersect each other at two-three locations to enable tourists to go to locations of their choice,” said an official, requesting anonymity.

Another official said that the tourism department has also planned to set up interpretation centres, eateries, and recreational activities at some sites, which are under jurisdiction of Archaeological Survey of India and other agencies like Delhi Development Authority.

436,['13/03/2020'],"Like U’khand in 2016, BJP will face humiliation in MP too: Harish Rawat","Dehradun: Former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat who has been deputed by the Congress to help Kamal Nath save his government, says he is offering advice based on “my own experience of handling a similar situation engineered by BJP in Uttarakhand in 2016.”

The former chief minister had faced a revolt from a section of his MLAs in 2016, who had subsequently joined the BJP. With the Congress government short of majority, central rule was imposed in the state but Rawat was later able to prove his majority in the House and save his government. In view of his experience in dealing with the crisis, Rawat along with AICC general secretary Mukul Wasnik has been deputed by the party to help in the MP situation.

Rawat who was in Jaipur on Thursday told TOI that “90-plus Congress MLAs are currently in Jaipur and contact has been made with 14 other MLAs, who have been held captive at Bengaluru.” Exuding confidence that these 14 Congress MLAs were willing to return to the party fold, Rawat said, “I am confident that we will prove our majority in Madhya Pradesh. As far as Scindia ji is concerned, he held prominent positions for a large part of his political career but it was the need for power, which took him to BJP.”

He added that the situation was different when Scindia was in Congress as he had some MLAs in his camp. “After he quit the party, his followers do not want to do so, but still they are being forcefully kept at Bengaluru. It is surprising that the PM himself is negotiating these things,” he said.

He alleged that on Thursday, the father of a Congress MLA went to Bengaluru to meet his son, but he was also detained at a police station. “What kind of democracy is this where a father cannot meet his son and bring him back?”

Attacking the BJP for creating political instability, Rawat said, “There is a sense of political uneasiness in the states because of the Narendra Modi government. They have created similar situations earlier in Assam, Uttarakhand and Goa and now are doing it in MP.” He claimed that the BJP’s top leadership was “unable to digest anything which is against them, even the peoples’ mandate.” “Whether it is through Vijay Bahuguna in Uttarakhand or Jyotiraditya Scindia in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP is quick to pounce on the situation and aggressively act against any state government which is of another political outfit.”

440,['13/03/2020'],Colour blind may get licence to drive,"Representational photo.

NEW DELHI: Colour blindness may not remain a bar any more for getting licence to drive private vehicles and those with “mild or moderate colour vision deficiency” may get to drive commercial vehicles too.

The road transport ministry is preparing the draft norms after a panel of ophthalmologists from AIIMS gave its recommendations on this issue. The ministry had referred the case to AIIMS to seek its view after receiving several representations.

Sources said debarring people with colour blindness would impact around 3% population.

Colour blindness or colour vision deficiency is the inability or decreased ability to perceive colour differences under normal light conditions. In India, prevalence of congenital colour blindness is about 8% in males and 0.4% in females. While conducting the study, the AIIMS panel found that European Union has dropped the provision of colour blindness to obtain driving licence while in United States, licences are not issued to such persons for driving commercial vehicles.

Citing international studies, the panel said those with colour deficiency can recognise traffic lights and signs based on multiple sources of information in addition to colour. It said ancillary clues such as luminance, position and pattern can help a colour-deficient driver in recognising traffic lights or signs.

The panel has recommended that there is no need to test colour blindness for licence to drive private vehicles including two-wheelers. It has also said badges, which the state transport departments issue to commercial drivers, can be issued to such applicants, if the deficiency is mild or moderate. In case of serious deficiencies, no badge should be issued. It also said the LEDs of traffic lights can be made friendly for people with colour blindness as per the International Commission on Illumination.

“It is a good step. It will not pose any challenge to road safety. If the applicants pass the practical driving test, which is becoming more automated, there should be no issue. This will also shut another door for corruption,” said Anil Chikkara of Delhi’s transport department.

Ministry officials said the Centre will issue guidelines to states on how to have uniform luminance, position and pattern of traffic lights and signals.

HYDERABAD: AIMIM floor leader in assembly, Akbaruddin Owaisi , on Wednesday said that minorities in Old City have been given a raw deal in terms of Metro connectivity. He said though he proposed re alignment on Old City route, the extension of Metro was delayed pending environmental clearances as it runs over Musi river.

Speaking in the assembly, he said, “In Chaderghat, Metro passes over the Musi, but there is no problem. However, when it comes to Old City, there is a problem, and every excuse is given. Is it not injustice? I am the one who had argued and fought for Metro rail, and I don’t get Metro in my area,” he said.

He said in 1999, when he was elected to the house for the first time, he had spoken about Metro rail. “The then CM, YS Rajasekhara Reddy, agreed to take a team of MLAs to Delhi to study the Metro. But P Janardhan Reddy, the then Khairatabad MLA, used to talk about mono rail,” he said.

Expressing concern that AIMIM is being singled out for non-clearance of Metro rail second phase, he said, “CM KCR also said that I have proposed the realignment. Yes, I have in view of many religious structures there. But they say alignment could not get clearance because of Musi. The second phase of Metro covering Old City has been promised, but actual work has not begun since many years.”

MA&UD minister KT Rama Rao said there are 96 religious structure in the proposed Metro route of Old City.

Owaisi also asked the government to allot Rs 2,000 crore for Old City from the proposed Rs 10,000 crore for the Hyderabad Urban Agglomeration. “Every year, Rs 10,000 crore will be given to Hyderabad, give Rs 2,000 crore for Old City,” he said.

“The government should spell out details of Rs 10,000 crore allotment, and conduct meeting with all elected representatives of GHMC area,” he said. He also expressed concern about pending dues of more than Rs 1,000 crore to water board. “Many government departments have not released dues for it, and government has not given any power fee waiver as promised,” he said.

NEW DELHI: A 26-year-old man was killed in Neb Sarai by two of his friends who later had unnatural sex with his body. The accused were arrested from Bihar on Thursday after a cat and mouse chase. The police teams travelled by road, rail and air to catch the accused men, who kept on changing their locations.

Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police, South, said: “The accused have been identified as Birender Kumar Jha and Gautam Kumar Choudhary. Both the victim and the accused worked as labourers in the same area.”

The murder was reported on Tuesday night. “The deceased had gone to the accused’s house to meet them, and had informed his sister about it. The next day, the sister dialled police at 6am and informed them about two people trying to move the body of her brother,” said a police officer.

A case of murder was later registered. A team led by Sudhanshu Dhama, ACP, Sangam Vihar was tasked to crack the case. The cyber cell was roped in and two teams of police started tracking the location of the accused.

The location of the accused was found to be near Anand Vihar in Ghaziabad. Subsequently began the cat and mouse chase between the cops and the accused. As a police team tried to trail them by road, the location of the accused changed. Another team of cops then took a train to catch the accused.

One of the accused, Gautam, meanwhile switched on his phone in the middle of their journey, which gave the cops a hint that they were heading towards Patna. Realising that they need to reach Patna before them, the cops then took a flight and reached Varanasi. From there they travelled by road and reached the Patna railway station where the accused were taken into custody.

The arrested men told the police that they were drinking together on the night of Holi. A minor argument erupted between them after which the accused strangled him with their hands.

Meanwhile, the average wholesale onion price at the Lasalgaon APMC, the country’s largest wholesale onion market, was increased by Rs 150 per quintal to settle at Rs 1,900 per quintal on Thursday — against Rs 1,750 per quintal on Wednesday — following reports of the stock limit withdrawal.

The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices at the Lasalgaon APMC were recorded at Rs 1,000 and Rs 1,900 per quintal, respectively, on Thursday. Around 15,000 quintal of onions were auctioned at the wholesale market.

“Imposing stock limits on onion traders had affected the purchase of onions. But the Centre has taken a positive decision of withdrawing stock limit following an increase in the arrival of onions in the wholesale markets. This may help the declining wholesale onion prices,” said Suvarna Jagtap, the chairperson of Lasalgaon APMC.

“This is a positive decision, but the Centre took its time. It should have withdrawn the stock limit two months back. The Centre also issued a notification on lifting the ban on onion export, but it is effective from March 15,” said onion farmer Nivrutti Nyaharkar.

The average wholesale onion prices are expected to increase marginally on Monday, which will be the first day of business after lifting of the export ban, said APMC officials.

450,['13/03/2020'],Coronavirus outbreak: Italy-returned man triggers alarm in Chennai,"Representative image

CHENNAI: An Indian national who has been roaming around Chennai after visiting Covid-19-hit Italy sent health officials into a tizzy on Thursday. The 27-year-old, who arrived in New Delhi from Milan on March 4, was taken to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) on Thursday, but doctors there let him go as he did not show flu-like symptoms. Hours later, after realising he had a travel history to Milan, they tracked him down to a hotel in the city.

The man was about to board an Air India flight to Port Blair at Chennai airport

on Thursday when he complained to the airline staff that he was feeling feverish. “The staff did not want to take a risk and sent him to the general hospital in an ambulance,” said an airport official. Officials said they did not know why the man, who should have been on 28-day home quarantine, was roaming around the city. “When he said he was feeling unwell, we decided he should be treated first,” said a senior airport official.

Unlike the international terminal, the domestic facility does not have a team to screen passengers for Covid-19.

Doctors were not aware man had travelled to Italy

The man was sent to RGGH where doctors and paramedics did a basic screening. “By the time he reached the hospital, he had no fever. The doctors did not know the passenger had travelled to Italy and so he was asked to go. We are enquiring how the breach in quarantine protocol happened not once but twice,” a senior health official said.

The man then checked into a city hotel. However, by evening when the directorate of public health realised the slip, they tracked him down to the hotel. At the time of filing the report, an ambulance was sent to ferry him to Government Stanley Medical College hospital.

452,['13/03/2020'],Budget is far from reality: Bhatti,"Hyderabad: Congress leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka said the budget was far from reality and questioned the rationale behind enhancing the budget from Rs 1.42 lakh crore to Rs 1.82 lakh crore.

During a debate on the budget in the assembly on Wednesday, Vikramarka said the budget was enhanced despite the government admitting impact of economic slowdown on the state.

He said the government earmarked Rs 10,000 crore for Hyderabad and urban agglomeration, but there was no mention about how it would want to spend the amount on flyovers, roads or any other projects. He said Musi rejuvenation and riverfront was completely neglected by the government. He further said the government should make efforts to protect Himayatsagar and Osmansagar under GO 111.

He said the government, instead of regulating liquor sales, was promoting the sales going by the estimated excise revenue of Rs 16,000 crore next year. “The government should not forget Disha incident in Hyderabad and Samatha incident in Adilabad. In both incidents, the culprits were under the influence of liquor,” he pointed out. He took objection when some ministers said contents of his speech were not related to the budget.

TRS MLA Gandra Venkataramana Reddy termed the budget ‘progressive’ and said Rythu Bandhu should be renamed as ‘KCR Rythu Bandhu’ scheme.

454,['13/03/2020'],NMC officials in trouble for leaving cash in Yes Bank,"Nashik: Municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game has served notices to the chief accounts and finance officer (CAFO) and six other officials of the Nashik Municipal Corporation’s finance department for not withdrawing cash from Yes Bank despite his instructions given in October 2019.

Last year, in view of the reports on Yes Bank and its condition in the stock market, Game had instructed the NMC’s CAFO and the chief accounts officer of the smart city company to ensure that there is not a lot of cash left the their accounts in the Yes Bank.

While the smart city company withdrew most of its cash, the NMC account officials did not. As a result, around Rs 296.93 crore is still stuck in the Yes Bank after the RBI put restrictions on it.

“I had instructed the CAFO and chief accounts officer of the smart city. The smart city withdrew most of its cash, but NMC’s CAFO did not,” said Game. He added that the notices have been given to the CAFO and other NMC officials. “Responsibilities are to be assigned to these officials for their negligence,” he added.

Total funds of Rs 296.93 crore of NMC and around Rs 14.71 crore of the Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation Ltd (NMSCDCL) are stuck in Yes Bank as the RBI has placed the bank under a moratorium, capping maximum withdrawals at Rs 50,000 per account for a month. The restrictions on the Yes Bank will be in place until April 3 this year.

This has forced the NMC to stop its online services to pay various taxes like property and water taxes. The NMC had tied up with Yes Bank and all online payments of taxes were deposited in its account with the financial institution.

Of Rs 296.93 crore, Rs 174 crore are the funds to be given to the state government under additional premium FSI. The remaining funds are of property, water and miscellaneous taxes.

NMC commissioner said the CAFO has justified that he had sought guidelines from the state government about the accounts, but it did not send the guidelines. “We will fix the responsibilities on all the officials from finance department for the NMC’s money being stuck in a private bank,” Game said.

According to NMSCDCL officials, the Rs 14.71 crore that it has in its Yes Bank account is mainly used for disbursement of salaries of its staff and meet its other establishments costs. Earlier, NMSCDCL had withdrawn its Rs 450 crore and transferred the same to other nationalised and private banks.

Neither parking will be allowed on these stretches, nor jaywalking. After trials on these 18 stretches (see box) for a fortnight, another set of 18 roads that will be made congestion-free will be selected.Traffic cops said a study had recently revealed that mixed land-use and improper parking were the main reasons behind the snarls. The problems will be addressed during the 15-day drive, which started on Wednesday.Most of the 18 stretches selected are within 2-3 km in length. To decongest these, the cops would be turning portions of the stretches into one-ways at different times of the day, depending on the traffic volume. Additional personnel will be deployed to prevent unnecessary stoppages by commercial vehicles and on-road parking will not be allowed. A dedicated pedestrian crossing zone will also be created on these stretches.Police have formed a task force comprising personnel from the accident research cell, road safety cell and signalling cell to monitor the success of the new plan.During the trial period, teams of eight to 15 cops will be deployed for traffic management. “These stretches were picked after assessing the traffic volume and average speed during the peak hours. Most of these roads are either parts of the ring road or arterial roads,” said a senior traffic police officer.Stretches like the one between Savitri Cinema Hall and Chirag Dilli witness an average traffic speed of about 20 kmph during the peak hours due to the congestion.An officer stressed that multiple metro station outlets that lead to parking of commercial vehicles for last-mile connectivity were also resulting in congestion at several places. The cops have requested the metro authorities to create dedicated halt-and-go lanes for these vehicles, which should be away from the main arterial roads.“Our aim is to eventually turn these stretches into complete congestion-free zones within the next few months. If required, some design changes may also be made,” said a police officer.Senior traffic police officers told TOI that a similar plan in areas like ITO and DDU Marg last year had evoked a positive response. “We have so far selected three stretches from each of the six traffic zones that were found to be most congested. This includes areas like Connaught Place as well,” said N S Bundela, joint commissioner (traffic).",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74603275,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-312763,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-parking-jaywalking-on-these-18-stretches/articleshow/74602456.cms

LUCKNOW: Sitting on a sparkling chariot, dressed in wedding finery and surrounded by relatives and friends dancing to dhol beats. If you are imagining a wedding procession led by a groom on an adorned horse, you are mistaken.In a shift from the age-old norm of a man bringing a baraat to his bride’s place, the city on Thursday witnessed a unique ‘ dulhan ki baraat ’ led by 22-year-old bride Rachna Vidyarthi. After almost an hour of dancing by her ‘baraatis’, Rachna reached the wedding venue where her groom’s baraat arrived from the other side. The ritual of ‘jaimala’ was performed at the gate. Once inside, the couple stepped on the stage together. In another novel step, the bride then proposed to the groom. The waiting family members cheered as the groom said ‘yes’.As unbelievable as it may sound, this is what happened at the wedding ceremony of the Daliganj resident who wished to challenge patriarchy and send out a message that women are no less than men. Executing the idea initiated by her father, Rachna said she felt driven to break the convention where a boy considers it his birthright to take out the wedding procession. “I realized that this change will empower many future brides and eradicate evils, including that of dowry,” said the bride, who has recently completed her masters in sociology and aspires to be a teacher.Her father Rajesh Kumar Vidyarthi, who first shared the idea with Rachna and her to-be husband Rupesh Choudhary, a banker, said the couple was more than willing to become agents of change.“In every community, it is expected that the bride’s family has to bow down in front of the groom’s family and accept their demands. As a parent, I never wanted that for my daughter.

They have ‘collected’ voices of 50,000 people from the city and neighbouring districts, which they have been broadcasting for the project ‘Vision India 2030 – Radio Hub Coimbatore’.

Members of the radio said they asked people to speak about their idea to change the society. “We went around areas such as Peelamedu, R S Puram, Race Course, Codissia and other prominent areas. We spoke to people from various communities and walks of life. We asked them to introduce themselves and asked them what change they wished to see in the city,” said S Manimaran, a final year student of PSG College of Technology who is the executive head for the project.

He said they collected the voices from last October 15 to this January end. “Each voice is around 2minutes to 3minutes long. We have so far broadcasted around 8,000 voices. We would have to broadcast till mid-year to complete broadcasting all the voices,” he said.

This was the first phase of their bigger project to collect 1lakh voices, he said. “We would start the next phase from June, the start of the next academic year,” he said.

Also, to put the idea of change into practice, as part of the project, they collected around 100 students and conducted a cleaning drive near Tidel Park, he said. “We have chosen the theme ‘Vision India 2030’ to honour the memory of former president APJ Abdul Kalam. We want to show that students haven’t forgotten his dream and we would carry it forward,” he said.

The station has also selected 108 people from among the 50,000 – to mark its broadcast frequency 107.8MHz – who have given the best ideas for change and would bring them to the station from the 20th to 24th of this month and hold interviews with them.

Station director B Chandrasekaran said being a community radio, they have taken up this project to bring in a sense of community participation in bringing about change. Last year, the community radio broadcasted programmes non-stop for 107.8hours to set a record. “That was an attempt to set a record. This is to usher in a change,” he said.

KOLKATA: Presidency University authorities have told the students that they will lift the 10pm curfew at the girls’ hostel in Salt Lake if such a move is endorsed by their parents. The authorities arrived at the decision after a meeting between vice-chancellor Anuradha Lohia and a section of students who have been demonstrating for over a month on the College Street campus.

“The girls at the Salt Lake hostel have been demanding relaxation in the curfew hours, which is 10pm at present. It is a matter of safety and security of the students, for which we are responsible. But since they are so adamant, we have told them to get it endorsed by their parents and we shall relax the timing,” an official said.

Last month, all the boarders had defied the curfew by staying out of the hostel after 10pm. They also protested against the alleged ‘high-handed attitude’ of the hostel authorities, high charges for guests and inadequate water coolers. “The meeting was fruitful. We discussed all the issues,” Lohia said.

Students at the meeting were shown documents pertaining to the repairs of the remaining blocks of the Eden Hindu Hostel. The demonstrators were told to directly speak with the government over the completion of the work. The university authorities agreed to install more water coolers at the Salt Lake hostel as demanded by the boarders.

“We showed them all the files and fund allocations for Hindu Hostel and told them that the university authorities can do very little. The students can approach the government directly. The day-to-day affairs of the hostel has been outsourced. So, the university has nothing to do with the discontinuation of services of some of the staffers,” said the official.

The boys agitating over delay in the reopening of three blocks at Hindu hostel and discontinuation of services of some staffers. “None of our issues were resolved in the meeting. There was even no assurance by the authorities to look into the matter. They were non-committal and refused to consider any of our requests,” said a student who was present in the meeting.

“We will discuss the matter with other students and decide the future course of action,” he said.

462,['13/03/2020'],Delhi: GB nominees in row say they are social workers,"Delhi University

NEW DELHI: What links a salon owner, guest teacher, property consultant and an electrician with Delhi University? They were all nominated by Delhi government to the governing bodies of some DU colleges and are now the bone of contention between the government and the institution. DU’s rejection of their names has held up the formation of the GBs, in turn leading the state government to withhold funding to the colleges.

Delhi government again forwarded these name recently after their rejection last September on the ground that they didn’t “meet the university’s criteria for GB membership”. Chances are they will be rejected once again at the Executive Council (EC) meeting that DU has summoned on Friday to clear the governing bodies.

The rejections and the ensuing delay in the formation of GBs have left 12 Delhi government-funded colleges in financial distress with no money to pay the salaries of the teaching and non-teaching staff for two months now.

A Delhi Government official claimed that DU hadn’t responded to the nominations yet. “We forwarded the list of people we wanted on the GBs, but the university has not said anything,"" the official said. However, EC member V S Negi contented that DU had asked the state government to reconsider some of the names last October. “There were many names in the list that DU teachers weren’t happy about,” he said.

When TOI contacted the people whose names were in dispute, they claimed to be “social workers” and, therefore, eligible to become GB members. The university asserted, in turn, that the EC members could not confirm the NGOs these nominees were associated with, leading to their rejection.

Harun Salmani, a School of Open Learning graduate nominated to the Acharya Narendra Dev College GB, runs a unisex salon in Indraprastha Extension and denied any connection with the Aam Aadmi Party. He, however, couldn’t say why his name was suggested for the GB other than to conjecture it was perhaps because he was a social worker.

Delhi government proposed the name of Dharmendra Kumar as GB member for Bhaskaracharya College of Applied Sciences. The CV sent to DU as part of the process stated that Kumar was an electrician with eight years’ experience. Kumar, another SOL graduate, stated, “I was nominated because I have been working with RWAs as a social worker.” He added, “I have no connection with higher education, but if someone wants to work for the good of colleges, why stop them?”

Nominated for the post at Aditi Mahavidyalaya, Nitin Bhot, a property consultant with a BA degree from IGNOU, also declared himself a social worker. “Since the time I was in DU, I have remained in touch with college students and am always ready to help them,” he said.

The EC, in its resolution number 51 in 2012, had decided that anyone nominated to a GB of a college funded/maintained by Delhi government had to be either “a person of eminence with a demonstrated interest in the area of education or those who have made significant contribution towards the promotion or administration of higher education, person of eminence in sports, culture or the arts or person of eminence in the sphere of development of education institutions.”

According to Negi, “Many of Delhi government’s nominations to the GBs don't fall in the three categories laid down by the EC. Sujit Kumar, professor of commerce at BR Ambedkar College, who hasn’t got his salary for two months, added, “You need people connected with education.

Nagpur: People need to perceive the eternal inspiration given by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj through his principles, way of life and actions. His principles should be emulated in today’s world, said thinker Sumant Tekade on Wednesday.

He was delivering a lecture on ‘Shabdanchya Palikadle Shivrai’, organized to commemorate Shivaji jayanti according to ‘tithi’ at Scientific Society Hall, Laxmi Nagar. The event, titled ‘Shivjayanti Utsav’, was organized by Chhatrapati Seva Pratishthan. Officiating pro vice-chancellor of Nagpur University Vinayak Deshpande presided. Organization secretary Sanjay Deshkar was present.

Tekade said “Shivaji Maharaj instilled in his army the spirit of fighting back. With the motto of destroying the opponent’s capacity to fight, Shivaji proved to be a leading figure in guerrilla warfare. Indians were able to endure agonizing torture inflicted upon them by the Portuguese.”

Highlighting his mother Jijabai’s way of parenting, Tekade said, “It was a tradition to mould children from a young age. Jijabai fostered in Shivaji the qualities of a warrior from a tender age. We have forgotten to practice this custom in the present world.”

He spoke about the time Shivaji devoted to inculcate knowledge, skills and attitude. “Youngsters complain of dearth of job opportunities in Nagpur. They should give enough time from their busy schedule to develop personality. Even if one starts at a lower level in a specific line of work, the goal must be to reach the top with hard work and passion,” he added.

“Novels and cinemas are not a testimonial to history. They are just forms of entertainment and fun as the media allows freedom of expression and fictionalization of certain events. History can be called an account written by contemporary people during a particular time. Context and references are relevant information pertaining to a specific subject,” he said.

One should read pertinent books to connect with historical facts, he said.

He also spoke about how swarajya should be a medium to uplift the last man.

At the outset, Atul Guru, an expert on Shivaji’s forts, and activist Datta Shirke were felicitated by Deshpande for their efforts to propagate ideals of the Chhatrapati.

Coronavirus has become cause for concern and parents should talk to the children and resolve their queries so that they do not panic.It starts off with kids watching TV about coronavirus. The father promises to explain it in the evening but the kids are curious and they call Vaayu for help.Vaayu, who appears as a superhero, explains about what viruses are, and that it could spread through touch, float and move through air. “That is why doctors and teachers always advise to cover your mouth when you sneeze or cough,” Vaayu says.Of course, one wonders if kids in that age group understand words like mortality.

465,['13/03/2020'],Uttar Pradesh: SIT files FIR against IPS officer on graft charges,"IPS officer Ajay Pal Sharma

LUCKNOW: Sixteen days after the three-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) submitted its report before the government on allegations of rampant corruption levelled by former Gautam Budh Nagar police chief Vaibhav Krishna against five IPS officers, it lodged an FIR against one of them.

Director General of SIT, RP Singh, said that on the directions of the government, an FIR under the charges of criminal breach of trust, criminal conspiracy and causing disappearance of evidence has been registered against IPS officer Ajay Pal Sharma .

“We have formed a team and would be probing into all the allegations against the IPS officer,” he said. He added that for the initiation of inquiry, the FIR registered by a woman at Lucknow’s Hazratganj police station has been taken into account,” said the DG. On March 8, a woman claiming to be Sharma’s ‘wife’, had lodged an FIR with Hazratganj police station alleging that the officer had multiple affairs and in order to conceal it he had framed her in a fraud case and got her arrested on August 10, 2019.

However, IPS Sharma had told TOI that the charges were baseless and that the woman was also not her wife.

On January 9, 2020, a three-member SIT comprising then interim state police chief HC Awasthy, who was also heading the vigilance department, IG STF Amitabh Yash, and Jal Nigam MD Vikas Gothalwal was formed on the directions of the CM to probe the allegations of graft levelled by Krishna against five fellow IPS officers, Ajay Pal Sharma, Sudhir Kumar Singh, Ganesh Saha, Rajiv Narain Mishra and Himanshu Kumar, .

Krishna had filed a complaint in August against the five officers to the department of home and also marked it to the DGP on August 23, 2019.

While this probe was on, on January 1, this year, explicit videos and chats of Krishna went viral. The Noida SSP had then described videos as “morphed” and part of “organised attempt” to malign him. Krishna had alleged that five IPS officers he had named were behind leak.

He also linked the leaks to the “confidential” report he had sent to the government. He also filed an FIR against unknown persons for morphing and sharing videos. The videos were sent for forensic examination in Gujarat and no tampering was found. Then an SIT was formed and probe started.

The SIT had recommended government action against two IPS officers along with vigilance probe. The other three were accused of misconduct.

Answering a question in the legislative council, the minister said water requirement (as per world standards) for producing one kg of rice is 2,300 litres. “In India, the requirement ranges from 1,786 litres to 3,683 litres,” he said.

The minister, however, said there was no truth in the claims that 5,000 litres of water is being used for production of one kg rice in Telangana.

He said that in the low-land field methods using borewells, water was saved up to 30% in stretches of erstwhile Karimnagar, Nizamabad, Warangal, Khammam, Nalgonda, Mahbubnagar, Rangareddy and Medak districts. “Efforts are on to involve international institutes and take up cultivation of paddy with less water usage,” he said.

He said Telangana Sona and Batukamma varieties are less dependent on water. “Research is also being conducted to get new varieties of paddy seed,” he added.

468,['13/03/2020'],Hindu Munnani rally passes off peacefully,"Coimbatore: The rally organised by the Hindu Munnani , which had close to 2 ,000 members from BJP and several Hindu outfits, passed off peacefully in the city despite provocative speeches by some of the participants on Thursday evening.

The rally was led by Hindu Munnani state president Kadeswara Subramanian and BJP leader C P Radhakrishnan. It commenced from Anna Statue, passed through Huzur Road and culminated near the district collectorate office where a meeting was held. Heavy police force was deployed all through the procession. Speakers at the event launched an unbridled attack on the members of another community accusing them of attacking Hindu functionaries.

Some of the speakers warned that there would be consequences if the attacks on their leaders continued. One speaker called for boycotting the commercial establishments run by another community. “This is what we have decided in Tirupur,” said the Hindu Makkal Kootamaippu leader from Mangalam in Tirupur, where there was an unrest during a pro–CAA meeting which was opposed by a section of the locals.

“We are patient because we are concerned about the peace and harmony of the city,’’ declared another leader.

If the prime target of the Hindu outfit members during the speeches was members of another community, the city police also came under equally scathing attack. They alleged that police had failed to prevent the attacks and take stringent action against the perpetrators. “There is a clear intelligence failure on the part of police. We have been informing police about the threats to our leaders. But police have failed to act,’’ said a Hindu outfit functionary. While police were acting tough when it comes to Hindu outfit members, they were lenient with Muslim outfits, he alleged.

“Let the city police allow the National Investigation Agency to take over the probe,’’ demanded another.

BJP leader C P Radhakrishnan blamed the DMK for the current volatile situation in Coimbatore, alleging that DMK’s backing for anti–CAA protestors was the root cause of the violent attacks happening now.

All along the procession, participants raised slogans demanding action against the assailants who attacked Hindu outfit members. Finally, they submitted a petition to the district administration largely accusing the city police.

The 42-year-old politician has been representing the seat since 2013 .Mohaniya who was in Dehradun on Thursday told TOI that his focus will be on increasing the support base of the party in the hill state.“My current focus is on improving the organisational structure of the party in Uttarakhand. There are around 10,800 booths in the state and we will make sure that each booth is covered by our party workers,” he said. He added,“We have presented an excellent model to the entire country through our works in the last five years in the national capital. Our party has done exceptional work in the education and health sector in particular. AAP is the first party in the history of Indian politics to ask votes based on the work they have done. We want to assure the people of Uttarakhand that if they give us a chance, we will replicate the same Delhi model here as well.”The MLA who is also vice-chairman of the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) said that neither BJP nor Congress has done anything for the people of Uttarakhand in the past 20 years.“Both BJP and Congress have done nothing significant for the state. In fact, the policies of the ruling BJP have affected the state very badly. Also, there is no point voting for the Congress as their leaders eventually join the BJP due to which there is a decline in their core support,” Mohaniya said.He added that although he hadn’t been to most of the districts of the state yet, he had “found that AAP is quite popular in Uttarakhand.”“My party has given me the responsibility of the state as I have an organisational experience and have been part of the party since the time of Anna Aandolan movement.

470,['13/03/2020'],"With flights to Hyd, Chennai, frequent flyers on cloud nine","Coimbatore: Air India has introduced a new flight to Hyderabad and an additional flight to Chennai, much to the joy of both business and leisure travellers,

The new flight to Hyderabad will leave Coimbatore at 12.35pm from March 29 and land at 2.05pm. It will depart from Hyderabad at 2.40pm and land here at 4.10pm.

The additional flight to Chennai will depart from Coimbatore at 4.50pm and land in Chennai at 5.50pm. The flight to the city will be a mid-morning flight, departing from Chennai at 11.05am and reaching Coimbatore at 12.05pm.

While tickets to Chennai start at Rs 2,350, those to Hyderabad are available for Rs 2,550 as part of the promotional offer, said Air India station manager Girija Ramesh. “It includes a baggage allowance of 25 kilograms and free meals on board.”

The new flights are expected to benefit frequent fliers between Coimbatore and Chennai, especially central government employees who are often allowed to claim official travel and leave travel allowance on Air India flights.

Air India currently has only one flight between the two cities, that too in the afternoon—departing from Chennai at 1.20pm and reaching Coimbatore at 2.20pm and again leaving Coimbatore at 3.05pm and landing in Chennai at 4.20pm. “The new flight, which reaches Chennai at 5.50pm, will reduce the waiting time for passengers to catch connections to countries like Dubai and Muscat in the late evening and night,” said Ramesh.

Frequent fliers to Hyderabad are also expected to benefit from the new flight, because only Indigo operates flights between the two cities. The three flights are early morning, afternoon and evening flights. “The new Air India flight, which departs at 12.35pm, is expected to give us an early afternoon option. By the time we land and reach hotels, it usually becomes 3.45pm or so, which is still more convenient than reaching the city at 6pm, with 2pm being the check-in time in most hotels,” said Sangeeta M, a clothes exhibitor.

471,['13/03/2020'],Saudi travel ban triggers scramble for tickets,"Kozhikode: The decision by Saudi Arabia to temporarily ban travel of citizens and residents to and from a number of countries including India, EU and 11 nations, on Thursday, triggered a scramble among NRKs who had come home on leave to secure tickets in Saudi-bound flights for their journey back

The order issued by the Saudi government in the early hours of Thursday states that the temporary air-travel ban will come into effect after 72 hours and that Saudi citizens and residency visa holders are allowed to enter the kingdom within that period.

“Many passengers preponed their return to Saudi and a lot of people are asking for tickets, but the flights for Friday and Saturday are fully booked,” an airline official with Saudi Arabian Airlines said.

A one-way ticket to Dammam from Karipur airport which was available for Rs 18,000 till a week ago increased to Rs 40,000, according to travel agency sources in Saudi. Airlines operating in the sector have given preference to Malayali expatriates having Iqama (Saudi residence permit) which expires within a few days.

Saudi has, however, excluded health practitioners working in the country and hailing from India and Philippines as well as flights for evacuation apart for shipping and trade trips.

Saudi Arabia had last week imposed temporary ban for Umrah visa holders and tourist visa holders to enter the kingdom as part of Covid-19 precautionary measures.

Meanwhile, Indian consulate in Saudi has arranged a 24-hour helpline for stranded umrah pilgrims at 00966-5544 04023. Indian mission will assist them in returning home.

Also, Saudi Arabia had this week temporarily banned flights from nine countries, including United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, which had affected many expats who had booked connection flights to Saudi via other Gulf-based carriers.

With Saudi also imposing ban on travellers from India, the number of Gulf countries which have travel restrictions in place for Indian expats have risen to three, the others being Qatar and Kuwait.

KOLKATA: A Bangladeshi barge , with fly ash on board, sank in the Hooghly near Pujali in South 24 Parganas on Thursday morning after colliding with a vessel of the Syama Prasad Mukherjee Port Trust (SPMPT).The port vessel — DV Rabindra — was on its way to Diamond Harbour when the Bangladeshi barge entered the navigation channel without warning. The collision left both vessels damaged. While the DV Rabindra managed to sail away towards Diamond Harbour, the master of the barge — MV Mamatamoyee Maa— attempted to sail the vessel towards the shore. But it sank close to Akra due to the bore tide. All 13 crew members were rescued.“Around 10.30am, the DV Rabindra master spotted the barge in the channel. Barges in the Indo-Bangladesh Protocol Route are supposed to stay away from the navigation channel. The DV Rabindra was on an urgent buoy repairing work, but tried to take evasive action. The master also asked MV Mamatamoyee Maa to pull away, but it didn’t. SPMPT chairman Vinit Kumar has ordered an inquiry,” a senior port official said.Manirul Islam, pilot of the MV Mamatamoyee, admitted that his vessel was not supposed to be in the navigation channel.“I realized that there was something wrong and was trying to call the pilot of another barge ahead of us over the wireless when the collision occurred,” he said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74603529,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-134866,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bangladeshi-barge-sinks-after-collision-with-port-vessel/articleshow/74601596.cms

Marking an end to an 11-year-old legal battle, the empty theatre on Thursday saw workers making arrangements to hand over the property to Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC).The lease for Bengal Properties had expired in 2006. Litigation started in 2009. In between, the hall was shut for two days in 2011. Thereafter, it remained open while the former lease owner was locked in a legal battle with KMC. On Thursday, mayor Firhad Hakim said, “The lease period had got over. The court has given an order in favour of KMC. They will hand over the property to us.”Sunit Singh of Bengal Properties, the former lease owner of Roxy Cinema said: “We tried our best and exhausted all our options. Now, there is no point dragging this issue. There were few cases that went against us. We got the notice last week. Due to the weekend and Holi holidays, we could not meet the KMC officials. We will be handing over the property and have requested the mayor to absorb the staff. He said he would look into the matter. The KMC has shown some interest in acquiring the AC machine and seats. If they get a fair value of it, they might take it. If not, they will give us time to remove it.”As one walked inside the theatre, it was hard to miss copies of the order that was pasted on the wall. “The division bench of the Calcutta High Court had issued an order against us in 2016. The order had stated that we should be evicted from the premises. Subsequently, the land acquisition officer filed an eviction suit against us. That order came on March 6. We didn’t want to contest that anymore,” Singh added.Posters on Friday’s release — Irrfan Khan ’s Angrezi Medium — hung all over the walls. It is another story that the film will not get a release at Roxy any more. Manager Swapan Chakravarty, who has been around since 1997, was working on a war footing to complete the handover procedures. On his table was a packet of popcorn that hadn’t been disposed. Rows of unused tickets in pink, green and yellow stared at him from a wooden cabinet. This certainly was not the future that the maker of this theatre had foreseen when it had opened sometime around 1908-09 as an opera house named Empire Theatre .The last film to have been screened was ‘Bhoot Part One: The Haunted Ship’. Only 27 people had attended the 6pm show at this theatre with a seating capacity of 730. Crestfallen, Swapan and gatekeeper Asad Bahm hadn’t even gone to watch the movie. “We just didn’t have the heart. On Wednesday, 36 and 40 people watched the 12.30pm and 3pm shows of ‘Brahma Janen Gopon Kommoti’,” he said.But things were different when the theatre had opened in 1941. There are stories of Netaji having come over to Roxy to watch another Ashok Kumar-starrer — “Kismat”. Roxy had set a national record for running ‘Kismat’ for three consecutive years. A nostalgic Chakravarty shared memories of watching ‘Maachis’ that had run for 16 weeks. Said he, “During those days one would see four shows of the same movie daily. People would get into brawl over tickets and even crib over why tickets were being sold in black. Since 2010, each theatre started screening two to three movies daily. That too couldn’t draw viewers. People have just lost the urge to watch movies in single screen theatres. As workers, we are now worried about our future.”",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74604988,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-217869,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/a-journey-of-eight-decades-ends-as-roxy-screens-its-last-show/articleshow/74601594.cms

Shaik Chand Basha, a resident of Kishan Bagh in the city, has been working for the company since 1993.

Basha’s wife Kouser Begum, in a letter to Union external affairs minister S Jaishankar, urged the Consulate General of India (CGI), Jeddah, to help her husband get his dues and return home.

In response to MBT leader Amjed Ullah Khan bringing it to the notice of CGI Jeddah the problem of Basha, the CGI said it was aware of the case. “Indians working in Safa Company do not want to go back without their pending salaries and other benefits. The company has collapsed financially and the assets liquidation case is going on in the court. The case may take some time to resolve,” CGI Jeddah said.

Kouser Begum said her husband Basha, holding Saudi Arabia ID card no. 4650002808 and permit no. 2086043684, was working as a steel fixer in the company in Jeddah. Since 1993, the employer provided vacation for regulation and the last time Basha had come to India was in January 2016. After vacation, he returned Saudi Arabia and resumed duty.

The 60-year-old man filed an application with the company for final exit and wanted all his service benefits be cleared up to 2017. However, it did not happen. Basha approached a local court, which passed a final judgement on July 21, 2019, directing the company to pay him 63,520 riyals and settle the issue.

“Despite this, his arrears have not been released and he is also being harassed by the company so that he will leave Saudi Arabia without getting his dues,” Kouser Begum said in the letter to the Union minister. She said his health was also failing and he also had cataract in the eye.

More than 32,000 tickets had been sold by Thursday afternoon against the stadium capacity of 50,000. Besides Lucknow, fans from Kanpur and Sitapur too have bought tickets for the big day. They cursed coronavirus in unison for shattering their long-cherished dream of cheering live for the Men in Blue. “We have been assured that the tickets will be refunded, but who cares about money. We are willing to pay extra if we are allowed to watch the ODI from the stands,” said Himanshu Gupta, a postgraduate student and among the first to buy tickets. Gaurav Khanna, a resident of Vibhuti Khand, couldn’t stop wondering how he would explain the situation to his kids, aged eight and 12. “They were so excited. They bought new autograph books and blue tees. I am scared to disappoint them,” the father said.Indiranagar Sector-10 resident Rahul Dhawan had a suggestion for UPCA under these unprecedented circumstances. “The authorities should allow fans entry after thermal scanning. Not only us, Team India will be disappointed too in the absence of a cheering home crowd,” he reasoned. Virat Kohli fan Jatin Srivastava had purchased a VIP ticket. “I wanted to see Virat bat up close. When will I ever get an opportunity to watch him in an ODI live? This is so frustrating!” said the Jankipuram Sector-H resident. Ayush Verma of Aliganj had booked four tickets online. “It was meant to be a perfect family outing on a Sunday. We will now have to watch the match on TV. The virus has ruined our dreams,” he said.",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74603442,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-224303,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/match-in-empty-ekana-stadium-coronavirus-stumps-cricket-fans/articleshow/74602538.cms
476,['13/03/2020'],"Using cops to vacate assigned lands is a mockery of the system, says HC","Vijayawada: The AP high court on Thursday said the state government was “making a mockery of the system” by deploying police to evict people from the assigned lands.

Despite the interim orders passed by the high court, police were deployed to evict people, the court said adding, “If the situation continued like this we will write orders to the Union home ministry to take corrective steps”.

The high court bench was headed by Chief Justice J K Maheswari, Justice A V Sesha Sai and Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy. The court took cognizance of the representation given by Kula Vivakshanirmulana Porata Samiti (KVPS) as suo moto public interest litigation (PIL). It asked why the assigned lands are being taken from beneficiaries. The high court also heard the petition moved challenging the land pooling scheme being implemented in Visakhapatnam to take assigned lands.

Advocate general S Sriram explained that the assigned lands are being taken as per the provisions of the law and compensation is being paid to the affected people.

He said the state government has the power to take the assigned lands for public purpose. Turning down the argument of the advocate general, the high court observed that the government cannot spend public money to compensate the people evicted from the assigned lands to assign them to someone else. If any need arises in future will the government again pay compensation and take the assigned lands from the beneficiaries and allot to someone else questioned the high court.

Pointing out cutting of trees, the high court asked the advocate general under which provisions the trees are being cut down. Does the government know that cutting down trees without following guidelines is an offence, the bench questioned.

The AG said that no trees were cut down in the assigned lands and only those in the government lands were cut. The bench said cutting trees even in government lands is an offence and there are many Supreme Court judgments on the issue.

The high court bench also took serious objection over destroying crops with earth movers to take over the lands even if they are encroachers.

“The revenue officials are changing the land records illegally. Register cases against the officials who altered land records under Sections 467 and 468. Is there a rule of law in state or not,” the bench said. Reserving the orders over the issue, the high court asked the AG to submit the land records pertaining to those taken in Visakhapatnam under land pooling scheme.

Turning down the request of the AG not to give interim orders as the preparations are being made to allot house sites, the court observed that the government cannot distribute land when the model code of conduct is in force even though the process was initiated before the announcement of elections.

478,['13/03/2020'],"Rajinikanth: Actor Rajinikanth plays Baba, disappoints fans","Rajinikanth

CHENNAI: They were not lines from a prepared script, but the emotions that played out at a Chennai hotel on Thursday were intense: expectation, trepidation, disappointment, hope. As actor Rajinikanth spoke to journalists, spelling out a plan that seemed both lofty and daring, thousands of fans, who were tuned in to the live telecast, must have watched aghast, many in a state of disbelief.

Taking a sudden deviation from the much-anticipated political road map, actor Rajinikanth has opted out of the CM race. This could be an exercise either to shore up his image or a tantalizing teaser, months ahead of a big state election. Fans would like to believe that Rajini was testing the waters to see whether public sentiments towards his political launch was just lukewarm or searing hot.

Hoping to ignite an awakening, Rajini said, “Antha eruzhuchchi theriyettum, appo naan varen…” (Let there be a wave, then I will come). These words may have given hope to thousands of his followers, who have been playing the waiting game for more than two decades now.

But the words were preceded by Rajini’s assessment of the strength of his opponents that seemed tinged with fear and awe.

“We are facing two giants (the DMK and the AIADMK) with massive strength, money and muscle power … Can we defeat them both? Can I use my fans as sacrificial goats?” said the actor.

His admission about his state of health was even more revealing. Such candour may deter fans, but his advisors are hopeful. They believe that it might just work. They say the actor envisions a revolutionary, systemic, political cultural change and not just a change of government by targeting the CM chair. He is shrewd enough to realise that it would take more than a large fan following or a thirst for change to usher in a ‘revolution’ or a political wave that helped MGR, Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi win elections in the past.

“Rajini perhaps wants to position himself above Telugu Desam founder N T Rama Rao, AIADMK founder M G Ramachandran, former DMK chief M Karunanidhi and former AIADMK leader J Jayalalithaa … much above electoral power, parties, and the political system,” said perception strategist Jhon Arockiasamy.

Observers point out that the Thursday revelation was an indication of the ‘spiritual’ Rajini trying to rise above the aspiring ‘political’ Rajini. They say he wouldn’t want to emerge as a political leader by exploiting his stardom, but be a people’s leader by ushering in ground-breaking systemic changes.

A close associate of the actor believes Rajini has a deeper plan. “It is the DMK which has better potential to win the election. In the coming months, he will identify the party and its leader M K Stalin as his arch-rival.” Now there is no powerful trigger to set off a political surge for or against his opponents.

While the actor has given his fans a preview of his political call-sheet, the real pitch is yet to be unveiled. The crucial question here is will his dual-leadership formula work for him in the tough poll arena next year.

479,['13/03/2020'],RBI cautions state against moving funds from pvt banks,"Bhubaneswar: The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) on Thursday advised the state government against moving deposits from private banks to public sector banks in the wake of the Yes Bank crisis, since doing so may have “stability implications” on the “banking and financial sector.”

Stating that “apprehension on safety of deposits in private sector banks is highly misplaced,” N S Vishwanathan, deputy governor of RBI, in a letter to chief secretary Asit Kumar Tripathy, wrote, “The RBI has adequate powers to regulate and supervise the private sector banks and by using these powers it has ensured that the depositors’ money is entirely safe.” An official source said the RBI has written similar letters to other state governments.

The RBI letter comes close on the heels of the government seeking to transfer Rs 545 crore deposited in Yes Bank accounts by Puri Jagannath Temple to a public sector bank. While Odisha’s finance minister Niranjan Pujari on March 7 wrote a letter to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman seeking her intervention for release of the funds, the temple administration wrote to RBI the same day to transfer the amount to its UCO bank account. The BJD MPs also took up the matter with Sitharaman.

Deposit of temple funds in Yes Bank has snowballed into a major controversy with the opposition BJP and Congress seeking a probe into it.

Quoting media reports, the RBI letter stated, “Some states have advised government bodies and entities under their jurisdiction to transfer funds held with private sector banks. It is pertinent to mention that the resolution of weak private sector banks in the past has been done in a manner that the depositors are not put to loss. It is precisely with a view to refraining depositors’ confidence in private sector banks and mitigating hardships, that after the imposition of moratorium on Yes Bank, the RBI had drawn up a draft scheme without any delay and we are making every effort to expedite the finalization of the scheme.”

Advising against such funds transfer, the RBI wrote that such “reactive decision will not be in the interest of stability of financial system in general and banking system in particular.”

In October last year, the RBI had forced the Odisha government to withdraw a letter cautioning various departments against depositing government money in banks in view of apprehensions regarding the fiscal health of some of them. The RBI on October 25 last year had forced the government to withdraw its letter — written by finance secretary Ashok Meena on October 21, 2019 — saying the state finance department should not issue such letters and it is for the RBI to review the financial health of banks.

LUCKNOW: A letter of ‘appreciation’ bearing the name of the state medical education minister was found to be fake. The letter gave a ‘clean chit’ to former vice-chancellor of King George’s Medical University (KGMU) Prof Ravi Kant and also praised him for his services.

Chhotelal, the personal secretary to minister Suresh Kumar Khanna , who also holds charge of finance and parliamentary affairs, on Thursday lodged an FIR at Hazratganj police station against an unidentified man for forging the signature of the minister on the letter. The forged document, dated January 24, 2020, states that Prof Kant, who is at present director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Rishikesh, is being awarded an appreciation letter for his exemplary contribution in medical education and health. It also states that no case or judicial inquiry is pending against him. The letter also has a ‘receiving’ from Prof Kant’s office on January 24.

The complainant said that the letter was brought to the notice of the minister recently and after examining the document, it was found that neither the letterhead was of the minister, nor the signature on it. The letter had Khanna’s party symbol lotus as logo, which is never used on the official letterhead of a minister.

Prof Kant, who served KGMU from 2014-2017, said that he was in Ahmedabad on January 24 and his office never received any such letter. “I have never seen any such letter,” he told TOI, adding, “It appears to be a conspiracy against me”.

Hazratganj SHO Santosh Kumar Singh said, “A case of forgery and cheating has been registered. We are tracing the origin of the letter.”

NEW DELHI: Escalating the crackdown on controversial Islamist outfit Popular Frontpfiof India (PFI), Delhi Police’s Special Cell has arrested its Delhi unit president, Parvez Ahmed, and secretary, Mohammad Iliyas, for allegedly funding the riots and fanning violence during anti-CAA protests in the city.

Earlier, police had arrested Danish Khan, a secretary of PFI.

The arrested men — Ahmed and Iliyas — were already under investigation by the Enforcement Directorate which is studying PFI’s financial transactions as part of a probe into the role of the outfit in anti-CAA protests.

The ED claims to have seized a tablet device from Parvez which purportedly has records of a chain of conversations about anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh and violence at JNU between him and a member of Parliament.

The agencies have also established a suspicious pattern of deposits into and withdrawal of money from PFI’s accounts.

Iliyas was first to be arrested from Jafrabad on Wednesday, while Parvez was picked up from Parliament Street in the evening where a protest against the arrest of Danish was planned.

Sources said that the cops made Iliyas call up Parvez to the “protest site” and arrested him upon arrival.

The Special Cell claims to have clinching evidence about PFI spreading fake propaganda and fanning violence during the anti-CAA protests.

Danish, who was arrested earlier, handled the outfit’s intelligence wing and was spotted at all major protests in the city. “His interrogation has given clues regarding the outfit’s ‘information war,’” an officer said.

The FIR, in the case was filed by the Crime Branch, but since the larger conspiracy regarding the Delhi riots is being probed by the Special Cell, the matter has been transferred to them, said a senior official.

PFI has, however, called the move a conspiracy against it. “Whatever happens in India, the agencies put their blame on us. Never in the past have such allegations been proved. Even this time, we will come out clean,” the outfit stated.

484,['13/03/2020'],"Suicide averted, but what were the rescue personnel thinking?","Chennai: Tragedy was avoided but a farce unfolded at Alandur on Wednesday when a 42-year-old woman threatened to jump off the terrace of her house and fire and rescue personnel stuck their hands out of a window holding a piece of cloth (see photo) hoping to catch her as she fell. Luckily for everyone, the woman heeded the pleas of her daughter and clambered back to safety.

The incident, however, raises questions about the training given to fire and rescue personnel. It’s one thing for several people to hold a piece of cloth at the four corners to catch someone jumping down. But to expect to catch a fullgrown woman in some cloth held out of a window by two pairs of hands begs the question: what were they thinking?

The woman who lives on Karpagar Vinayagar Koil street in Alandur was upset with her husband because he refused to transfer in her name his share of ancestral property that he had got recently. They had an argument on Tuesday and on Wednesday, soon after her husband went to work, the woman went to the third floor terrace of their apartment and stood near water tank threatening to jump off.

Her 19-year-old daughter tried to pacify the woman but in vain. Neighbours efforts too proved futile. They alerted the St Thomas Mount Police and a fire and rescue team arrived. And that’s when a bright spark decided to stick a bedsheet out of the window.

Using a bedsheet to hold a victim is highly risky, admitted a senior fire officer. During training they trained to hold the victim using a net, he added.

After about 45 minutes of pleading and cajoling by her daughter while the firemen milled around, the woman gave up her suicide bid.

Civic chief Radhakrishna Game said the civic body has already prepared a plan for admissions of patients in case of urgency in both isolation and quarantine wards.

“We are focusing on precaution, isolation and quarantine ahead of the outbreak of coronavirus. There is no need to panic, and people just need to take precaution and preventive measures,” he said.

A civic official said that of the 50 hoardings 18 — three each in six divisions — have been installed at major locations. “The remaining 32 banners have been put up at primary health centres and civic hospitals,” he said,

The hoardings and banners urge people to wash their hands with soap or sanitizers frequently, use handkerchief in case of could and cough, take nutritious meal, drink enough water and take adequate rest.

The hoardings also advise people to refrain from shaking hands, avoid contact with suspects, not to spit in public places, among others.

“As we do not have adequate number of physicians, we have urged the association of physicians to provide doctors in case of urgency. The association has promised the NMC to provide all kind of help,” the official said.

“We have over 25 residential quarters adjacent to NMC’s Bytco hospital for fire brigade department and those can be used in case of urgency,” he added.

The NMC has also made a WhatsApp group of over 250 private hospitals so that they can inform the civic body about patients on a daily basis.

The civic body has also warned of action against private hospitals if they hide information about patients coming from abroad.

486,['13/03/2020'],Mysuru: Farmer growing cannabis in KRS backwaters held,"Representative image

MYSURU: Couples meeting in secret in the backwaters of KRS near Belagola, some 15km from the city, may have caught a whiff of something heady in the air. But for all public purposes, Siddaraju was growing kosher plants on his land and he and his son, Manjunath, ran a tea stall in Belagola village in Mandya.

Earlier this week, though, the city crime branch received a tip and nabbed 60-year-old Siddaraju who was on his way to Mysuru. Then, they landed up at his tea stall and caught his son as well. What they found on father and son left their jaws hanging – 24 kilos of cannabis aka marijuana , which could have easily fetched them over Rs 1 lakh.

Siddaraju told police he had been growing hemp for more than 30 years now in the backwaters and along with his son, sold the stuff in Mandya and Mysuru city. A growing clientele of youngsters, fake swamis and city dealers spread the word of a father-son duo ferrying homegrown marijuana and business grew over the decades. Siddaraju said 50g of the fix fetched between Rs 150-Rs 200 at the very least.

It is perhaps the biggest ever disclosure of illegal cannabis business in the recent past in Mysuru.

An officer admitted that the incident showed marijuana cultivation and addiction was growing in Mysuru right under the authorities’ noses. Police are investigating whether Siddaraju had other aides or accomplices. Deputy commissioner of police (law and order) AN Prakash Gowda told TOI that officers have been directed to conduct raids at suspected points.

For now, though, it seems Siddaraju ran a tight ship. He grew cannabis among other plants and thick bushes and since the areas is desolate, his secret was safe for three decades. Police said even his son did not know where the cannabis was grown and had only been trusted to sell the stuff.

Police said Manjunath had been arrested for selling ganja sometime back and was in judicial custody for a while but Siddaraju has escaped the police radar so far. CCB ACP V Mariappa and inspectors A Mallesha, Vivekananda HR and Kiran Kumar C, who are part of the investigation team, have intensified investigations to uncover the duo’s network.

While Siddaraju preferred to sell in Mysuru because it was close to home, police said cannabis was being smuggled into Mysuru from Shivamogga as well. A part of Mandi Mohalla has remained a haven for drug peddling despite frequent raids by cops and excise authorities. In 2019, a woman was arrested for selling marijuana after one of her relatives was detained by cops and spilled the beans.

He does not want to talk to anyone and cribs when she talks to someone . Now the girl's parents have started complaining about his behaviour. Is this normal for such a small kid ?Answer by Dr Rachna Singh: Hello. Thank you for writing to us. I understand your situation and your concern regarding your child.First and foremost it is very much evident that your son has formed quite an attachment with this girl. Having said that it is not necessary that this is indicative of any attraction in a romantic or sexual way. He probably likes her a lot as a friend and wants her attention all the time. That explains why he cribs when he sees her talking and getting close to other children in his class. He probably is becoming possessive of her since he sees her as a best friend. This is a very normal trait in children of this age.I suggest you to gently talk to him about his classes and then take the conversation ahead to his friends in the class. This will give you a glimpse of how he feels about his peers and a lot more . You can then talk to your child about friendships in general and explain why it's important to have a good social circle, and the importance of having more friends versus one sole best friend.I would also encourage you to create certain distractions for him. Try to take him to the park or other places of activities such as sports, recreational activities etc. Introduce him to new kids of similar age and help him so that he can get along with other kids and make more friends. It will also be a different space for him to grow.I would suggest you to talk to the girl's parents about this friendship. You can explain it to them as well, that it is normal for children to experiment with different kinds of things, and probably this kind of friendship is one such step of experimentation and nothing to be worried about. Rather, both sides of parents should work as a team towards handling it. I also suggest you that, you should talk to his teachers as well and ask them about his behaviour in class and explore about other children’s behaviour towards him.Lastly, even though I am sure you love your child a lot, express a lot of love and affection towards him, which will further make him feel secure in his relationships.I hope this helps .

BENGALURU/BHOPAL: High drama prevailed at a resort on the outskirts of Bengaluru on Thursday when Madhya Pradesh minister Jitu Patwari attempted to enter the premises where 23 rebel Congress MLAs who have resigned their vidhan sabha membership are holed up. Following a mild scuffle, police arrested Patwari under IPC section 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharging her/his duty) and later released him on station bail.

In a bid to persuade the rebels to return to the Congress fold, Patwari and Lakhan Singh Yadav, another MP minister, had arrived in Bengaluru. They were accompanied by the father of one of the MLAs — Manoj Choudhary.

In a video of the incident which was widely shared, Patwari is seen attempting to enter the resort, while policemen are preventing him. It also showed the minister in a heated argument with police. At a press conference in Bhopal, senior Congress members Digvijaya Singh and Vivek Tankha showed a dramatic video in which Patwari, Yadav and Choudhary are shoved around by unidentified people.

“This is a case of abduction and forced captivity,” Tankha said, adding, “You abduct and take our MLAs to a different region, and hold them hostage. They cannot even contact their families as their mobile phones have been taken away. They are not there out of free will.

What BJP is doing is a criminal act and an unbiased probe should be conducted by the apex court because BJP-led Centre will not be interested,” he said.

However, cops said the MLAs from MP had recently written to the Karnataka DGP seeking police protection. Nineteen Congress MLAs who are loyalists of Jyotiraditya Scindia had said in the letter that they had come to Karnataka “voluntarily” on “important work”, police said.

Candidates were also announced for 8 wards in Visakhapatnam south, 5 each from Pendurthi and Gajuwaka constituencies. 23 of the 40 candidates are from the backward class (BC) category and three are from the scheduled caste (SC) category. 15 of the 40 candidates are women.

Not everyone among the YSRC cadre was happy with the list. Heated arguments ensued in the midst of the announcement. Paradesi Naidu, of ward number 15 who was anticipating a ticket for his wife but who was not given the same said, “We have a population of 4,500 of my community in the ward.

493,['13/03/2020'],"Rebel trouble ahead of YSRC, TDP","Visakhapatnam: YSRC and TDP are likely to face rebel menace during the GVMC elections.

In every ward, YSRC will have more than one aspirant. “Community, local relations, money and muscle power are at play in local elections. In any election, the ruling party will have an edge,” said a senior YSRC leader.

In 2007, more than 30 rebels from both the Congress and TDP ranks contested as independents. Of the 72 wards, 10 independents won. Congress won 27 and TDP 32 seats. But Congress won the mayor’s post with the support of 10 independents.

TDP and YSRC are facing the threat of rebels in 15 out of 98 wards. The rebels will be mostly in wards in the city’s outskirts and industrial areas, besides a few in the city. “Many leaders who worked for the party in the last nine years may not get the seats. Parties tend to look at money factor and not the services to the party,” said a senior TDP leader.

In a ward, there would be around 15,000 votes and on an average 11,000 to 13,000 votes would be polled. In a triangular fight, the one who gets more than 5,000 votes, would be the winner. Rebels can cut into the main parties’ vote share and hence the worry in the camps of YSRC and TDP.

495,['13/03/2020'],Ahmedabad: Blind man behind bars for five vehicle thefts,"Representative image

AHMEDABAD: Ahmed Shaikh (32), a resident of Rakhial, has been behind bars for more than two months in connection with five two-wheeler thefts. His medical reports certify him as being 100% blind. He has moved high court to quash all five FIRs citing that he is 100% blind and could not have been involved in such incidents.

In December 2019, Shaikh was booked for stealing two-wheelers from parts of the city. Ramol, Isanpur and Naroda police registered one FIR each against him, and Vatva police booked him in two theft cases. He was arrested in the cases, one after the other, on statements by other accused, showing him to be part of the alleged gang of vehicle thieves.

As soon as he was arrested and brought before the court in various cases, his advocate M A Sangram presented medical certificates issued by the Blind People's Association in 2009 and by Civil Hospital in 2017. He opposed Shaikh's remand proceedings and judicial custody, but the metropolitan courts were inclined to send him to jail in the second week of January.

This is not the first time Shaikh was arrested by city police in a criminal case. He was booked in two cases of vehicle theft in 2017 by Bapunagar police. He was acquitted along with a common co-accused, Aslam Chhotu, in one of the cases, whereas he still faces trial in the other case.

Cops challenge Shaikh’s claim of being blind citing CCTV footage

Interestingly, in the case in which Ahmed Shaikh was acquitted, police had strongly challenged his claims of being completely blind. The cops told the court that a CCTV camera in Bapunagar captured Shaikh riding a two-wheeler. Sangram put up a lame argument that it was the handiwork of his co-accused. However, the complainant in this case was in no mood to prolong the case because his vehicle had been found and returned to him.

As he had not received relief in these cases, Shaikh moved the Gujarat high court last month, seeking quashing of all FIRs. His advocate in the HC, Anurag Rathod, contended that Shaikh could not have taken part in the thefts because he is 100% blind. He needs assistance in his day-to-day activities as well. He was arraigned in the theft cases merely on the basis of statements by the co-accused, which have no value as evidence in the absence of independent evidence against him.

After hearing the quashing plea, Justice S H Vora sought a reply from the state government as to how Shaikh was involved in the offence. A further hearing is posted for March 24.

498,['13/03/2020'],DK Shivakumar’s elevation ignites hopes of Congress’ revival in North Karnataka,"File photo of DK Shivakumar

HUBBALLI: The Congress high command ’s decision to appoint the party’s trusted troubleshooter and former minister DK Shivakumar as the president of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee ( KPCC ) has ignited hope among the party’s functionaries and workers in North Karnataka of ending the BJP’s dominance in the region.

For some time now, Congress has been struggling to make a dent in the BJP’s prospects in North Karnataka, a failure that party insiders attribute to the lack of a strong local leader, coupled with the absence of a popular member who can appeal to the masses.

It is not that there are no Congress members in the region – HK Patil , SR Patil, MB Patil , IG Sanadi, Vinay Kulkarni and KB Koliwad, to name but a few – but in most cases, their popularity is confined to their respective districts, and none of them has a footprint across the vast North Karnataka. This glaring lack has had a telling impact on the Congress’ fortunes at the hustings, where it has been faring poorly in both the assembly and parliamentary elections.

The elation that has greeted Shivakumar’s elevation in North Karnataka is not without cause. The former minister’s organisational strengths have earned him a grudging respect even among his opponents, and despite hailing from the Old Mysore region, Shivakumar has proven his mettle in North Karnataka, where he remains a popular leader. He spearheaded the campaign for VS Ugrappa in the 2018 by-election to the Ballari Lok Sabha seat, wherein the senior Congress member was pitted against B Sreeramulu’s sister J Shantha. Ugrappa posted a thumping victory, besting the BJP candidate by a margin of over two lakh votes. “Later, when MLA CS Shivalli’s death necessitated a byelection in Kundagol, Shivakumar pitched tent in the constituency for more than two weeks and ensured a decisive won for the Congress,” said a senior Congress functionary.

But it is not going to be a daunting task for Shivakumar to assert his strength in a region where the Lingayats constitute the majority. As a Vokkaliga strongman, Shivakumar, in addition to bringing the other senior members in the region including MB Patil, who was a strong contender for the KPCC top post, on the same page, will have to win over the Lingayats, who have traditionally been staunch supporters of the BJP in the recent past.

The political landscape in Belagavi is another landmine, where Shivakumar will have to tread very carefully. With Ramesh Jarkiholi crossing over to the BJP, the Congress’ position in the border district has further weakened, and the new KPCC chief will have to come up with a carefully thought-out strategy to ensure the party regains its dominance in Belagavi.

Youth Congress leader Shakeer Sanadi admitted to party workers feeling upbeat over Shivakumnar’s elevation. “Given his popularity as a trouble shooter, and reputation as strategist, we hope that, through his dynamic leadership, Shivakumar will bring all the leaders together and come up with a strategy to defeat the BJP in the next election,” he said.

MANGALURU: We the People of India, an organisation of like-minded people, held a daylong hunger strike demanding the withdrawal of NPR on the occasion of the 90th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi’s Salt Satyagraha near the deputy commissioner’s office here on Thursday.

Former MLA J R Lobo said an attempt is being made to divide people on the basis of religion in the nation. He expressed concern over the increasing prices of essential commodities and lack of employment. “The economy has been affected badly due to the economic slowdown. Industries and agriculture and other sectors are in a state of stagnation, and the development of the nation is at stake,” he said.

Shanthi Prathishtana managing director Mohammed Kunhi said if Mahatma Gandhi could make India independent through satyagraha, the same mode of protest will also help people to reject the central government’s citizenship laws. “Hindus and Muslim in India have been living in harmony after Independence. However, the central government is now making attempts to divide people. Protests are being held at various places across India against NPR, NRC and CAA and it should continue till the fascist ideologies are rooted out from the nation,” he added.

The nation has witnessed the worst economic crisis, he said, and called upon people cutting across all religions to unite against fascist ideologies.

Former mayor K Ashraf, corporators Abdul Latheef, Abdul Rouf, CITU Shramikara Sangha president Willy Wilson, social activist Vidya Dinker, writer A K Kukkila, DYFI district president B K Imthiyaz, SDPI district president Ataulla Jokatte and UNIWEF president Rafiuddin Kudroli were present.
