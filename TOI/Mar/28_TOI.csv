It’s also de-stressing

Food for thought

For Kochi-based techie Arun Nair, the day often started with opening a food delivery app. By the time he was ready for office, his breakfast would be delivered, and if not he would have grabbed a quick bite from any restaurant en route to office, where he would do the same for lunch and dinner. It was the same for marketing professional Sreeja Raj, a working mom, who used to turn to food delivery apps often to order something interesting for her kids. That changed after the lockdown Now, working from home, Arun opens his refrigerator first thing in the morning, wondering what to whip out of the available ingredients. And Sreeja is on a nostalgic cooking mode, bringing back her mom’s special healthy snacks and drinks from the past. No, they aren’t all about hoarding ingredients from supermarkets or going into ‘extravagant cooking,’ but the quarantine mode has definitely given our kitchens a new lease of life.With time at their disposal, many Malayalis, especially bachelors like Arun, are trying their hand at cooking, and relishing the experience too. Arun says, “Not that I distrust the services but I don’t want to risk it, and want to ensure health also in these testing times. That’s why I reluctantly started with small things like eggs and noodles. Now, I have graduated to tea, rice, peas curry and pappad. And whoever thought I would do it! I have no plans to make anything fancy or buy too many ingredients but understanding that I can cook for myself to survive is a cool feeling.”Mikhael and Kayakulam Kochunni fame actor Vishnu Premkumar, who stays in Kochi, says, “I was never the kind who ventured into the kitchen but now with the lockdown, I have learnt I actually can enjoy cooking. I was pretty impressed with the simple lunch I made two days ago, with rice and two curries.”Sreeja, who gets to spend more time at home with her children, aged four and five, says, “I’m digging out my mom’s old simple, quick-fix recipes like ariyunda, kozhukkatta, ada and the like, which my kids are quite new to. Who knows, I might continue this even post the lockdown.”For many, cooking is also a de-stressing activity at a time when you are confined to the four walls of your house. Kochi-based Dr Krithi Ullal says, “It’s tough when kids are at home without going to school and domestic help also can’t come. So, I involve my four-year-old daughter Aanya too in cooking to keep her occupied. I ask her to knead the dough, make shapes and roll chapathis. Once done, she is very keen to eat the food she made. I am also planning to start a bit of balcony farming. Some of my friends are also involving kids in baking.”The lockdown has interestingly made the new cooks question the logic of all that money shelled out on apps in the past. Arun says, “I guess I can save some money now. I have learnt that the basics of most of our cooking are same. I have also learnt what and how much to stock in the fridge of a bachelor pad. It has made me a lot more independent.” Meanwhile, Sreeja hopes, “I don’t want to stop this. It can keep my kids healthier and I can try my hand at some inventive recipes also now.”",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74844986,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-708897,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/with-available-stock-malayalis-discover-their-cooking-skills-revive-old-recipes/articleshow/74844984.cms
1,['28/03/2020'],#CoronaScare gives rise to group games on chat platforms,"Until recently, social distancing was something we might have done when one spotted a chatty neighbour or a former bad date at a party. But with the Coronavirus situation, social distancing has become the norm.Those living in gated communities say they are finding this lockdown tough as their evening gatherings, gossip sessions, kitty parties and bhajan time are cut, and they are forced to be confined within the four walls. Aparna M, a resident of a society in the city, says, “Our society association has put up very strict rules in place. Even maids are not allowed inside and the household chores with no communication to the outside world make it miserable for me.”However, Sowmya Santosh Rajan, a homemaker with two kids, says she is making the most of the lockdown period and having fun with her friends through their WhatsApp group. “We have a ladies group and we have decided to come up with different games that we can play while maintaining the social distancing. This way, we make sure that we are not social media distancing.”Here are a few games that some of the groups are playing on chat platforms...Sing a songThis is a very simple game wherein one of the members throws a challenge to the rest to sing a song based on a colour or theme. The one who sings the maximum number of songs in a particular time period is declared the winner. “Though I am not very good at singing, I love singing. But I make sure I record the song locked up in the room so that no one at home hears me. But I have no such inhibition when it comes to my group members listening to it,” says Anusha B.AntakshariThis is, again, a song-based game. While one member starts the game by singing and uploading the pallavi of a song, the next member has to start a song with the last word of the previous song. Jayanthi Y says, “Our group has started off with classical songs and old film hits. Let’s see how long we can take this forward.”Write a storyGeetha R, who is fond of reading, has been utilising this lockdown time to read as many books as possible. She says that’s how she got the idea of penning down some lines. “When I discussed the same with my friends, who are voracious readers, they decided to join, and together we are weaving stories on WhatsApp. While one member writes one line of the story, others pitch in with the rest of the lines. I think, by the end of the curfew, we will have some five to six good stories, and we plan to publish them as an e-book or in a blog,” she informs.Kiss, Marry or Kill“We are finding this super fun to play,” starts off Gayathri P, who is forced to spend her time as PG in a society in the city as she could not travel to her home state due to the curfew. She says that hers is a small group of youngsters and they find the game a great way to pass time. Describing the game, she says, “One member will select a celebrity and ask the rest if they want to kiss, marry, or kill that particular person.” However, she adds that they don’t stop with celebs alone, but include the names of their male colleagues and bosses, “since some of them have their crush, in the office”.Unpopular opinion“This brings out the best and the worst in the group members,” says Komal T. “We know that most of our group members are fans of celebs. So, to irritate them, one member will initiate the game with a statement like XYZ...is not worth playing the role/getting the award. You should see the responses… the group becomes something like a war zone, with a flood of angry messages. Since we take popular film personalities, from objections to arguments and fights, everything takes place on our chat group,” she laughs.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74849034,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1245017/74849034.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/coronascare-gives-rise-to-group-games-on-chat-platforms/articleshow/74849034.cms
2,['28/03/2020'],Sethu will always be the co-actor with whom I gave the biggest hit of my short career: Vishakha,"Actor and dermatologist Dr Sethuraman aka Sethu , who made his debut in Kollywood with the comedy Kanna Laddu Thinna Aasaiya (KLTA), and did a handful of films like Valeba Raja, Sakka Podu Podu Raja and 50/50, passed away due to cardiac arrest on Thursday (March 26). Vishakha Singh , who played his female lead in two of his films, shared with us her memories of the actor.“I still don’t know how to process this. This has come as such a shock. And during these times. Unfortunately, we can’t even pay our respect,” begins Vishakha.“Sethu will always be the co-actor with whom I gave the biggest hit of my short career,” states the actress who is now an entrepreneur. “We did two films together — KLTA and Valeba Raja. KLTA was very very special for both of us. We had a great director, Mani, and co-actor Santhanam, who would cover our mistakes during the shots,” she says.Recalling their days on the sets, she says, “I remember how much Sethu helped me during the song Naan Sollurappa Solluven. Not many people know of this because it was at the end of the film. I remember telling him that he had a very good handwriting for a doctor when he gave me the lyrics of this song written in English so that I could memorise the lines for the lip sync to match. It was the only song which had him and me dancing together. And both of us had two left feet.”Vishakha says the two of them bonded over the fact that they wanted more than just films in lives. “He would talk about dermatology and I would discuss opening my own business at some point in the future. He also loved fashion and cars. But the most vivid memory I have is of him telling me about his dreams for the future. ‘I can’t wait to hold my baby in my arms. I would love my kids so much. And give them the best. I will buy little Armani clothes for them,’ he’d say. I remember this because not many young boys talk about babies. My heart goes out to his little daughter, his young wife and his parents. May they find the strength in these crazy times to cope with this loss. He has gone too soon,” she signs off.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74848648,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-910877/74848648.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/sethu-will-always-be-the-co-actor-with-whom-i-gave-the-biggest-hit-of-my-short-career-vishakha/articleshow/74848648.cms

The actor had married Manju Bhargavi in a private ceremony in Thiruttani Murugan temple on February 5. As the wedding was a sort-of rushed affair, Yogi Babu had planned to host a grand wedding reception for the film industry and other VVIPs.Only a few days ago, the actor had called on CM Edappadi K Palaniswami, Deputy CM O Panneerselvam and actor-politician Vijayakant to invite them for the reception.A source close to the actor confirms, “Yes, Yogi Babu has postponed the reception. Since the government had initially announced a shutdown until March 31, he had planned to go ahead with holding the reception in the first week of April. But once the lockdown was extended further, he has chosen to hold it once normalcy returns. The event might perhaps take place in May 2020, if everything turns out to be fine.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74848672,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1137432/74848672.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/yogi-babu-postpones-wedding-reception/articleshow/74848672.cms

5,['28/03/2020'],Pope prays for 'fragile' humanity needing help in pandemic,"VATICAN CITY: Praying in a desolately empty St. Peter's Square, Pope Francis on Friday likened the coronavirus pandemic to a storm laying bare illusions that people can be self-sufficient and instead leaves ``all of us fragile and disoriented'' and needing each other's help and comfort.Francis stood under a canopy erected on the steps of St. Peter's Basilica while leading a special prayer service as rain soaked the usually crowded cobblestone square. ``Open our hearts to hope,'' he said in his opening prayer.``Lord, may you bless the world , give health to our bodies and comfort our hearts,`` he prayedAt the end of the hour-long ceremony, he delivered a blessing that is traditionally reserved for the holy days of Christmas and Easter.Wearing a simple white cassock, Francis climbed the sloping steps of the square by himself until he neared a canopied platform that had been erected to shelter him from the elements, taking the arm of an aide for the last steps.Francis referred to the 17th-century colonnade that delineates St. Peter's Square while praying, ``From this colonnade that embraces Rome and the whole world, may God's blessing come down upon you as a consoling embrace.''Then, moving to a temporary altar near the basilica's entrance, he prayed silently and listened to a series of invocations, including one that said, ``Save us, O Lord, from illness, epidemics and fear of one's brother.''The Vatican has said that the faithful could receive what's known as a plenary indulgence _ a lifting of temporal punishment _ from sin with the special blessing, providing they meet other conditions, like going to confession or receiving Communion as soon as they can.The prayer service was one of several scheduled over the next few weeks that will see the 83-year-old pontiff virtually solo in the square or celebrating Masses for Holy Week and Easter Sunday in the shelter of St. Peter's Basilica instead of outdoors in the company of tens of thousands of faithful.Earlier on Friday, the Vatican announced that Francis will mark Holy Week ceremonies in the confines of Vatican City , including a Good Friday Way of the Cross service on the steps of the basilica, instead of at Rome's Colosseum as customary.Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Francis will celebrate Mass for Palm Sunday, Holy Thursday, and Easter vigil and Easter Sunday _ April 12 _ all at the basilica's central altar.Before the pandemic, putting Italy and many other countries under stay-at-home orders that severely limiting people's movements in public, tens of thousands of faithful would have crowded the square on Palm Sunday and Easter for outdoor Mass celebrated by the pontiff.Good Friday's candlelit procession at Rome's ancient Colosseum traditionally draws big crowds of tourists, pilgrims and Romans. But weeks ago, both tourists and pilgrims started fleeing Italy amid fears of virus contagion and as lock-downs by local and national authorities were gradually declared.Italy's outbreak includes the world's highest total of dead for a single nation.COVID-19 can cause mild or moderate symptoms, like fever and cough. But a small percentage of sufferers are hospitalized with pneumonia in intensive care.The Holy See has confirmed four virus cases in the tiny independent city state in the middle of Rome.It has declined to say if Francis, who a few weeks ago had a cold, has been tested for COVID-19, and if so, what the result was. Among the Vatican's confirmed cases is an Italian prelate who lives at a Vatican hotel where Francis resides.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74855180,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-203812,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/pope-prays-for-fragile-humanity-needing-help-in-pandemic/articleshow/74855174.cms

It's that time of the week when we look at the viral videos of tinsel town. This week we came across the clips of Gaurav Chakrabarty showing his guitar and singing skills, Paoli and Nusrat sharing their cooking video – there was a lot to gush about. Check out viral videos of the week:This self-quarantine and isolation limiting social contact seems to be a bit difficult. However, actor Gaurav Chakrabarty who was recently seen in ‘Dwitiyo Purush’ takes the challenge happily. He is spending more time playing music at home, to keep himself and his wife Ridhima Ghosh entertained. Gaurav recently recorded and shared one of his performances on social media, and we can’t stop loving it. He croons the melodious hit ‘Hey There Delilah’ by the band called Plain White Tees while playing his guitar like a pro. It’s surely a delight to hear. Not only is the song an ideal throwback selection that evokes nostalgia, but Gaurav’s melodious and soulful voice and guitar playing finesse keep us happy for a while, even the most lonely moments of self isolation at home.Are you washing your hands properly, especially during this Coronavirus crisis? Then take the challenge today like actress Sayantika Banerjee . The pretty lady is the latest to take the #SafeHand challenge. She posted a video of herself taking the #SafeHand challenge on her social media page. Here, participants have to record a video of themselves washing hands properly, to encourage people to do the same.

She has also made the video quite entertaining, as you can hear the catchy music playing in the background and as always, she looks gorgeous.The lockdown has already been extended across the country until April 14. People have been urged to remain inside the home and take all the precautionary measures to contain the spread of Coronavirus.

While in self-quarantine at home the actor-director is utilizing his me-time in learning guitar. He even shared the video on Twitter and wrote, “Couldn’t find a plectrum at this wee hour of the night...aces, specialists, please don’t scrutinise! I’m rather out of practice, & probably was never that good anyway, but did feel the blues! all the way from the heart.” Mimi Chakraborty who is in home quarantine now after returning from her ‘Baazi’ shooting in London due to the novel coronavirus pandemic has an interesting message for her fans and followers.

jaan hai toh jahaan hai

Famed for providing lunch delivery services with clockwork precision, the dabbawalas of Mumbai have suspended their services in the wake of coronavirus pandemic . The network of 5,000 dabbawalas are known to deliver two lakh dabbas in the city daily. With the corporate life coming to a standstill and the ongoing countrywide lockdown , they have been forced to put the brakes on their services, something that has never happened in their 130-year-long tenure. However, they are hopeful that this too shall pass.It’s been a week since the dabbawalas delivered tiffins to offices. Affirms Subhash Talekar , President, Mumbai Dabbawala Association , “Our services are completely stopped now. We delivered dabbas on March 20 and post that, our work has come to a halt. This is the first time that we have stopped our services for such a long period (save one day in 2018 when the city was ravaged by a heavy downpour).” He adds, “Then too, our dabbawalas were already in the trains and got stuck there. But this time, it’s different. Besides, schools, colleges and offices are not functioning, so whom do we deliver the dabbas to?” That said, the going is far from easy for them.Dnyaneshwar Kandse, father of three, has been delivering dabbas on the Mulund route for the past 26 years. He says, “I’ve never seen anything like this. I’m worried as there are so many financial issues. Adds dabbawala Kailash Shinde, who has been operating on the South Mumbai route for the last 20 years, “We have always delivered dabbas even in harshest weather conditions. We feel bad about not being able to do our duty, but what can be done?”“This tough time will pass and we will all overcome this together.

Hungary was not included in the risky countries then, so I wasn’t worried. It was really on Parna’s and Zoya’s (Akhtar) insistence that I have self-isolated myself till March 30.Our office staff is working from their homes. Only a skeletal domestic staff is operating from our house. We have been counselling whoever we can to maintain a safe distance and wash their hands with soap and water frequently. With healthcare conditions in our country severely lacking, we simply do not have the wherewithal to deal with the pandemic if it hits in full force. There are not enough ventilators, ICUs and hospital beds, so we have to try and flatten the curve. Social distancing and going by the government advisories must become the norm. I participated in a board meeting (via phone) of the NGO I work with based in Ahmedabad for two hours. I am trying to Marie Condo the house starting with my books, although it’s really hard to part with them! But I really want to de-clutter and get rid of stuff I haven’t used for six months, whether it’s clothes bags or shoes. I don’t see the point of having a favourite sari or a favourite outfit if I know that I won’t repeat it. I’m glad Kate Middleton has been repeating her outfits and talking about sustainable fashion. Celebrities must set an example and repeat their clothes. Javed and I have also been reading a lot, watching movies and resting. I’ve recovered well but have to still get my strength back.It was a pure accident. I was sleeping at the back of my car because we had stayed up till early morning celebrating Javed’s birthday. Javed was in another car ahead of me with his cousin Dr Sumbul Warsi and her husband Nawab. We were on our way to Sukoon, our house in Khandala when a truck rammed into my car.Mercifully, I passed out and I remember nothing. When I came to my senses, I was in the ICU at Kokilaben Hospital , Mumbai. The doctors and hospital staff were exemplary. In fact, I remember very little of the entire period I was in the ICU. Every now and then I would hear snatches of a conversation where someone would say, ‘It’s a miracle she survived.’ My phone was taken away. It was much later that I saw the outpouring of concern and prayers from all quarters. It was overwhelming. I resumed shooting 40 days after the accident. It’s a miracle I didn’t break any bones or require surgery. But my nerves have taken a beating. I still have a lot of pain in my neck, arms and palms due to the accident.I’ve been shooting there off and on since October and it’s been great. I’m contracted not to say more than that at this stage about the project.It’s getting better. This is a very good time for actors because all kinds of work are coming our way. I’m doing drama, comedy, villainous roles in equal measure, and enjoying it. The advent of the casting director has changed the ecosystem, particularly for character actors. Earlier you had stock characters...Jeevan, Kanhaiyalal, Shivraj, etc. Today, the actors are being ferreted out from theatre and small towns. They bring a great degree of authenticity because acting is about reacting. This inspires the lead actors to push the envelope. Actors are no longer doing 12 films at one time, so they get the time to learn a skill, change body type, etc. Today, if you are shown playing the guitar, you can’t fake it. You have to learn the chords.In a patriarchal society like ours, women have to fight hard for a seat at the table. Boys are privileged over girls from birth. Equal opportunity and access for both girls and boys must become the norm.We need many more directors, producers and writers who have a female gaze. A woman director is not obliged to make a feminist film. She can make what she wants, a thriller, an action film, a comedy, or whatever, but hopefully, she will be informed by a gaze that is female.Love, friendship and a similar worldview. We belong to identical backgrounds...we could have had an arranged marriage given our commonalities!",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74850174,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-60084/74850174.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/shabana-azmi-its-a-miracle-i-didnt-break-any-bones-but-my-nerves-have-taken-a-beating/articleshow/74850111.cms

15,['28/03/2020'],Why #Shaktimaan Mukesh Khanna feels his superhero show will be a hit with children even today,"Soon after the announcement yesterday that Ramayan will be re-telecast, actor-producer Mukesh Khanna ’s TV show, Shaktimaan, started trending on Twitter, with people requesting for its rerun as well. Shaktimaan, a superhero show, was aired on Doordarshan from 1997 to 2005. Mukesh played the titular role and his alter ego, Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri, employed as a photographer in a newspaper called Aaj Ki Aawaz. As a show and a character, Shaktimaan found acceptance for its novel plot revolving around a common man, who attains superpowers through meditation and the five elements of nature. Every episode highlighted a socially relevant subject like the importance of hygiene, family values and morals rooted in Indian culture, and it also attacked social malpractices.When we spoke to Mukesh yesterday, he said, “It makes me happy that people are demanding a rerun, I will be glad if the ministry considers it. Shaktimaan and a few other shows were high on values, their content was such that India watched them. This lockdown has made people understand each other better. I welcome the decision to have reruns, this is the best time for that.” Over a period of time, the show was accused of tempting children to perform dangerous stunts at home, and that was one of the reasons for it to be pulled off air. However, Mukesh said, “The plugs on my show were not pulled because of complaints, but the escalated broadcasting charges. Kids learnt a lot from Shaktimaan; we always warned them, clearly, to not repeat stunts from the show.”Given that over the last decade, kids have been exposed to a wide variety of cartoons and shows from different countries, would they tune in to Shaktimaan now? “Yes, they will,” Mukesh said confidently, adding, “The shows of that era succeeded because of their content and not visual effects. Shaktimaan was a hit and will be a hit today, too. It has something for today’s children as well.”Surendra Pal, who played the main antagonist in the show, said, “A rerun of popular shows will help us bring back our old values into play. Shaktimaan was more for children and their edutainment. My character was called Tamraj Kilvish, and he was as powerful as Shaktimaan. He wanted to spread andhkaar all over the world, create misery. Shaktimaan was working to stop him and destroy his powers. My character often said, ‘Andhera kaayam rahe’. It was a fight between the good and evil. Shaktimaan, to me, signifies India which continues to fight crises with all its might and problems like coronavirus are like Kilvish’s army which will be destroyed, eventually.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74849504,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-51340/74849504.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/why-shaktimaan-mukesh-khanna-feels-his-superhero-show-will-be-a-hit-with-children-even-today/articleshow/74849483.cms

NEW DELHI: With reports of thousands of migrant labourers on the highways and stranded at various places, the Centre has sent an urgent advisory to states asking them to provide food and shelter to unorganised sector workers to ensure they stay where they are and do not take to the roads during the ongoing 21-day national lockdown The home ministry has stressed that the lockdown is intended to ensure people stay where they are as mass movement from cities to the hinterland will defeat the purpose of the exercise intended to ensure social distancing and isolation to break the chain of Covid-19 transmission and prevent a wider, potentially much more dangerous, community spread that might overwhelm the healthcare system.The Centre has said that daily wagers be provided support and sustenance as well as an outreach aimed at reassuring them that the lockdown will not mean lack of food and shelter and will not last beyond a stipulated time.“The idea behind the lockdown is that people should stay where they are,” said Salila Srivastava, joint secretary in the home ministry, during the daily official briefing on the Covid-19 situation.Home secretary Ajay Bhalla has urged all states and UTs to take immediate steps to provide adequate support, including food and shelter, to migrant agricultural labourers, industrial workers and other unorganised sector workers. All states and UTs have been advised to ensure that students and working women from other states are also allowed to continue in their existing accommodation during the lockdown.The lines of migrant workers walking back long distances to their homes have been triggered in part by the economic shutdown, which has deprived daily wagers of earnings and also because many are worried about how long the current situation will last.The advisory — which came in the wake of reports of migrant workers heading back to home towns on foot in view of suspension of train and bus services — suggests that states involve agencies, including NGOs, to provide food and shelter as well as basic amenities such as clean drinking water and sanitation to unorganised sector workers, particularly stranded migrant workers.Further, states have been advised to make these vulnerable groups aware of the measures taken by the government, including provision of free food grains and other essential items through the public distribution system (PDS). This, it is hoped, would help prevent avoidable movement of such people, according to the advisory.The MHA has also advised that states and UTs to ensure that hotels, rented accommodations and hostels continue to remain functional and delivery of essential items is streamlined so that students, working women and hostel inmates are allowed to continue in existing facilities, while observing social distancing.While ensuring supply of essential goods and services, states are being repeatedly directed to enforce the lockdown strictly and take action against violators under various provisions of law. This is imperative to contain the spread of Covid-19, the home ministry has underlined.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74855692,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-383434,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/give-shelter-to-stranded-migrants-make-them-stay-put-centre-to-states/articleshow/74855634.cms

She said transport should be made available to take the migrants home and district collectors should be made responsible for those who cannot afford to rent a guest house.The party urged immediate government focus on migrant workers forced to trudge long distances to their home towns and poor who are going without daily needs during the lockdown.Posting a video of a crying child saying he and his family were hungry for four days while police was shown caning away people trying to bring them food, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “The lockdown will devastate our poor & weak. It will deliver a heavy blow to the India we love. India isn’t black & white. Our decisions have to be carefully thought through. A more nuanced & compassionate approach is required to deal with this crisis. It’s still not too late.”AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra asked the government to help migrant labourers reach home in UP and Bihar, underlining that Indians stuck abroad were brought back by sending special flights earlier.“It is saddening to see that thousands of people are forced to migrate on foot towards UP and Bihar. They are Indians, our people, they do hard labour, they are poor. Is it not our responsibility to help them? When so many people were stranded abroad, we sent special planes to bring them back and unite them with their families. Every person desires to be at home with his family during a crisis. These poor have the same wish. They are labourers who work honestly in Delhi. All political parties should join hands to help them.

Speaking in military language, I would say that at present Covid-19 is in preparatory stage of impact in India. We are making concerted efforts to prevent it from establishing a firm base,” said Army chief General M M Naravane.“Concurrently, we are preparing for stringent counter-measures, should it manage to regain a foothold. The next few weeks will be crucial to prevent negative effects of this deadly mutant virus,” he added.India is also ready to help countries in the neighbourhood with assistance to build up infrastructural capabilities and expert manpower in tackling the coronavirus outbreak. After providing help to Maldives, for instance, the Army is now ready to dispatch a “rapid response team” to Nepal for assistance in dealing with the situation there.Within the country, the 28 earmarked military hospitals will manage service personnel as well as civilian patients transferred from state health authorities, in case their capacity is overwhelmed, said director-general armed forces medical services, Lt General Anup Banerji.With civilian testing labs for Covid-19 being inadequate in the country, the armed forces have also begun to conduct the tests at AFMC in Pune, Army R&R Hospital at Delhi, Army command hospitals at Udhampur and Lucknow and IAF command hospital at Bengaluru.“These hospitals can carry Covid test using RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). Six additional hospitals are also being equipped shortly with the resources to begin testing,” said Lt-Gen Banerji.The armed forces are already running six quarantine facilities at Hindan, Manesar, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Ghatkopar and Chennai, where 1,059 civilian evacuees from countries like Italy, Iran and Malaysia are currently housed. “Of them, three have tested positive so far. Additional quarantine facilities are on standby with 950 beds capacity,” said an officer.The armed forces, meanwhile, are maintaining their high state of operational readiness along the borders with China and Pakistan. “It is the responsibility of Indian Army to keep the borders safe while the country is preparing and fighting Covid-19.

One of the hospitals shut down the cardiac catheterisation lab, while another sealed a part of the building for a disinfection drive.Sources said the octogenarian’s grandson, who had returned from the UK about a fortnight ago after the colleges there shut, has also tested positive.Maharashtra’s cases went up to 153 on Friday from 130. Though that meant 23 new cases, the state government said 27 fresh cases had been added but kept the total count at 153. The discrepancy could possibly be on account of some of Thursday night’s patients being added to Friday’s list, it is said.According to the state, 15 of the new cases are contacts of the Islampur-based Sangli patients who had a foreign travel history. The total number of Covid-19-infected people from one family in Islampur went up to 24, with 12 more members testing positive on Friday.Four of Friday’s positive cases, the state said, are contacts of Thursday’s Nagpur case, there are 2 cases each from Mumbai and Thane and one each from Palghar , Kolhapur, Gondia and Pune.The 85-year-old city doctor , who developed symptoms a few days ago, is believed to have started experiencing breathing difficulty on Thursday morning following which he was taken for a CT scan to Saifee Hospital, Charni Road.Changes seen in his lungs during the scan raised a red flag that he was probably suffering from Covid-19. In the meantime, the man and his grandson, who had both taken a home test on Wednesday, came positive. Later in the day, the family shifted him to Mahim’s PD Hinduja Hospital, where he passed away around 12.30am on Friday.State officials didn’t attribute the death to coronavirus saying confirmatory tests were being carried out at Kasturba Hospital. “The man was a diabetic and had a pacemaker too,” said state epidemiologist Dr Pradeep Awate, who also said two of the family members had recently returned from the UK. At least two other family members had tested positive, sources said. The state maintained Maharashtra’s death toll remained at five as on Friday, the same as on Thursday.At Saifee Hospital, civic sources said 14 people were found to be high-risk contacts and quarantined at the hospital, while 26 found low-risk were advised home quarantine. The OT area and part of the ICU were sealed. While the father was undergoing CT scan, the cardiac surgeon son is believed to have gone near one of the OTs to meet people. Saifee has been told to cancel surgeries and not have OPDs for a few days, a civic official said.At Breach Candy Hospital, where the cardiac surgeon had operated on a patient on Monday, the entire catheterisation lab was shut for disinfection. Around 15 people from the department, including doctors, technicians, ward boys and sweepers were put under home quarantine. While hospital authorities couldn’t be reached for comment, sources said the hospital was putting together a list of patients the doctor had visited in the ward.AMC Suresh Kakani said the entire hospital hasn’t been sealed, but areas where the doctor visited or operated have been kept closed for disinfection. A decision on opening up these areas can only be taken after the second confirmatory test comes out. The doctor was tested in a private laboratory. “As per ICMR rules, the first ten positive results have to be validated by a government laboratory,” he said, adding all standard surveillance and isolation procedures are being followed.Saifee hospital management maintained their services were unaffected. “The deceased doctor underwent a CT scan at Saifee and was diagnosed as ‘diagnostic for Covid-19’. The surgeon was transferred to the special isolation facility at Hinduja where he died,” said Dr Vernon Desa, director, medical governance and clinical compliance at Saifee. “All containment and surveillance measures have been implemented to ensure safety of our staff, patients, and visitors. The hospital is fully operational,” he said.BMC officials said the burial was carried out by civic officials in the presence of a few family members.Medical education minister Amit Deshmukh said the state has started flu OPDs across 18 medical colleges. Health minister Rajesh Tope said PPEs are being procured by the Centre as well the state. “Even as the number of cases are increasing, there is an increase in patients getting better.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Friday invoked wartime Defense Production Act to force auto giant General Motors to manufacture ventilators, amid a supply shortage of the life-saving medical equipment in view of the mounting coronavirus cases.Price negotiations with the car company was taking time, Trump said.Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to use any and all authority available under the Defense Production Act to require General Motors (GM) to accept, perform, and prioritize federal contracts for ventilators.""Our negotiations with GM regarding its ability to supply ventilators have been productive, but our fight against the virus is too urgent to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course,"" Trump said.""GM was wasting time. Today's action will help ensure the quick production of ventilators that will save American lives,"" Trump said.On Thursday, Trump told reporters at the White House that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has shipped 6,000 ventilators to the states.Thousands of ventilators are being required in the treatment of coronavirus patients, the number of which has surged from just 8,000 about 10 days ago to nearly one lakh. It has also resulted in deaths of nearly 1,500 Americans and about 2,500 COVID-19 patients are in critical condition.Vice President Mike Pence said the White House is working with a number of suppliers to manufacture ventilators, even while they work with state leaders to assess ""not just what ventilators are available in their state hospitals, but what ventilators are available in private hospitals across their state"".""Governors across the country are doing great work evaluating the full supply of tens of thousands of ventilators that are available,"" Pence said.New York, which is the hotspot of coronavirus in the US, needs around 40,000 ventilators as early as possible.

23,['28/03/2020'],Coronavirus in US: Trump signs $2.2 trillion stimulus after swift congressional votes,"President Donald Trump finishes signing the coronavirus stimulus relief package in the Oval Office at the Whit... Read More

WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump signed an unprecedented $2.2 trillion economic rescue package into law Friday, after swift and near-unanimous action by Congress to support businesses, rush resources to overburdened health care providers and help struggling families during the deepening coronavirus epidemic.

Acting with unity and resolve unseen since the 9/11 attacks, Washington moved urgently to stem an economic free fall caused by widespread restrictions meant to slow the spread of the virus that have shuttered schools, closed businesses and brought American life in many places to a virtual standstill.

""This will deliver urgently needed relief,"" Trump said as he signed the bill in the Oval Office, flanked only by Republican lawmakers. He thanked members of both parties for putting Americans ""first.""

Earlier Friday, the House gave near-unanimous approval by voice vote after an impassioned session conducted along the social distancing guidelines imposed by the crisis. Many lawmakers sped to Washington to participate - their numbers swollen after a maverick Republican signaled he'd try to force a roll call vote - though dozens of others remained safely in their home districts.

The Senate passed the bill unanimously late Wednesday, 96-0.

""Today we've all acknowledged our nation faces an economic and health emergency of historic proportions,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. She said Americans deserve a full-on government response ""to address these threats to their lives and their livelihood and they need it now.""

The $2.2 trillion legislation will speed government payments of $1,200 to most Americans and increase jobless benefits for millions of people thrown out of work. Businesses big and small will get loans, grants and tax breaks. It will send unprecedented billions to states and local governments, and the nation's all but overwhelmed health care system.

""This is not a time for cynicism or invective or second-guessing,"" said GOP Whip Liz Cheney of Wyoming. ""This is a time to remember that we are citizens of the greatest nation on Earth, that we have overcome every challenge we have faced, and we will overcome this one.""

Despite reservations, arch conservatives joined with progressives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., to back the bill, which moved quickly through a Congress that's been battered by partisanship and is itself not immune to the suffering the virus has caused. Reps. Joe Cunningham , D-SC, and Mike Kelly, R-Pa., announced Friday that they'd tested positive, bringing the number of infected lawmakers to five.

Tea party Republicans said government orders to shutter businesses merited actions that conflict with their small-government ideology. Liberals accepted generous corporate rescues that accompany larger unemployment benefits, deferrals of student loans, and an enormous surge of funding for health care and other agencies responding to the crisis.

""I'm going to have to vote for something that has things in it that break my heart,"" said conservative Rep. David Schweikert, R-Ariz.

Many lawmakers summoned the bipartisan spirit of 9/11 and efforts to fight terrorism. Others praised the roles low-income workers play in keeping the country going and the heroism of health care workers. Some, like Iowa Democrat Abby Finkenauer, who had just learned of two additional coronavirus-related deaths in her district, came close to tears.

Others couldn't restrain their partisan impulses. Republicans chided Democratic leaders for delays and provisions they see as extraneous, such as funding for public broadcasting and the arts; Democrats said too many elements are a bailout for corporations that may not need it.

Still, in a chamber increasingly populated by lawmakers whose chief skill often seems to be partisan attacks, Friday's debate was a noteworthy break.

""We have no time to dither,"" said Rep. Gerald Connolly , D-Va. ""We have no time to engage in ideological or petty partisan fights. Our country needs us as one.""

The run-up to the vote contained an element of drama because libertarian conservative Thomas Massie, R-Ky., announced plans to seek a roll call vote.

Leaders of both parties united to prevent that because it would have forced lawmakers back to the Capitol or blemished their voting records if they stayed home. Instead, they made sure enough lawmakers would attend Friday's session to block Massie's move under the rules, and lawmakers took the unprecedented step of sitting in the visitors galleries to establish the necessary quorum.

The House promptly adjourned for a weeks-long recess but will return later in the spring to consider further legislation.

""This bill is not only a rescue package, it's a commitment _ a commitment that your government, and the people whom you elected to serve you, will do everything we can to limit the harm and hardship you face, both now and in the foreseeable future,'' said Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.

The massive CARES Act started as a draft plan among Republicans controlling the Senate who were seeking a greater voice in the coronavirus response efforts -- especially after Pelosi was a dominant force in earlier legislation imposing a sick leave mandate on businesses.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., welcomed Democratic participation a week ago, and signed off on a major expansion of unemployment insurance, but his efforts to freeze out Pelosi and force a quick agreement were met with Democratic demands for large infusions of aid to states and hospitals, as well as an assortment of smaller items. McConnell and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York wrestled for days, along with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other administration officials.

Negotiations finally produced a deal early Wednesday morning, and the Senate passed the measure by a 96-0 vote.

The legislation dwarfs prior Washington responses to crises like 9/11, the 2008 financial crisis, and natural disasters.

Key elements are untested, such as grants to small businesses to keep workers on payroll and complex lending programs to larger businesses. Rebate payments will go to people who have retained their jobs. Agencies like the Small Business Administration and state unemployment systems will be severely taxed, and conservatives fear that a new, generous unemployment benefit will dissuade jobless people from returning to the workforce.

The bill amounts to a bridge loan for much of the economy and carries a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion-plus annual federal budget.

The legislation also establishes a $454 billion program for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries in hopes of leveraging up to $4.5 trillion in lending to distressed businesses, states, and municipalities.

There is also $150 billion devoted to the health care system, including $100 billion for grants to hospitals and other health care providers buckling under the strain of COVID-19 caseloads.

It also seeks to strengthen the safety net for the poor and homeless. Schools and students would get relief, small business loans payments would be deferred. Evictions from public housing would be put on pause.

Republicans successfully pressed for an employee retention tax credit designed to help companies keep workers on payroll. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. A huge tax break for interest costs and operating losses limited by the 2017 tax overhaul was restored at a $200 billion cost in a boon for the real estate sector.

Most people who contract the new coronavirus have mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.

26,['28/03/2020'],Coronavirus news: Cops enforce India lockdown with blows &amp; insults,"An inquiry was ordered into the death of a 49-year-old ambulance driver on Friday after he was allegedly hit by police in Pune on suspicion that he was ferrying passengers illegally in his vehicle during the lockdown.Pimpri Chinchwad’s additional commissioner of police Ramnath Pokale confirmed that an investigation has been initiated. The case came to light when the son of the ambulance driver, who was accompanying him when the incident occurred, said they were stopped at a toll naka and the policemen assaulted his father. He claimed they were allowed to proceed only after making a payment of Rs 3,000 to cops. The video of the crying man has now gone viral.But it’s hardly the only video of its kind. Social media is flooded with footage of police highhandedness, attracting shock from across the country, as they punish people for coming out of their homes in the lockdown. The Pimpri Chinchwad incident comes days after another viral video showed three Punjab cops raining blows with lathi on the soles of a young boy’s feet as he cries in pain and for mercy.And in Badaun, migrant labourers on their way back home were made to crawl and do frog jumps on the road by policemen in UP.While the lockdown exempts essential services, there have been cases of police assaulting journalists, delivery boys or those venturing out to buy essential items.Two cops in Indore were suspended on Friday after they hit a TOI reporter who wanted to purchase milk during curfew break. According to the complaint filed with the police, health correspondent Antriksh Kar Singh was accosted by ASI KC Parashar and constable Atul Sharma, who were in a private SUV.Singh showed them his media ID card and pointed out that the Indore administration had exempted journalists from curfew restrictions but despite that he was beaten up by them. Elsewhere, those trying to buy groceries have had to brave lathis. A 35-year-old out to buy milk for his three children in Kolkata died of a cardiac arrest soon after an alleged thrashing by cops on Wednesday.Lal Swami’s wife, Annu, alleged that police beat him in the market and he collapsed when he reached home. Police have denied any assault. The man’s postmortem report said he died of chronic diarrhoea and cardiac arrest. A probe, however, has been ordered by Howrah police commissioner Kunal Agarwal.ADG (Meerut) Prashant Kumar said that “disciplining disobedient crowds is the biggest challenge in containing spread of Covid-19”. Sudhanshu Sarangi, police commissioner (Bhubaneshwar and Cuttack), maintained that force was being used to ensure lockdown “if people don’t follow directions” and “don’t discipline themselves”. If not brute force, cops are humiliating people by making them rub their noses on the ground or do sit-ups. In one photo shared on Twitter, cops are seen deflating tyres of a vegetable seller’s vehicle to keep him of the street. Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma admitted they have received a large number of complaints against police.Two sanitation workers were beaten up in the city this week while three constables were dismissed from service for allegedly shooting and injuring a mini-truck driver. Policemen admit there is lack of clarity and confusion on what constitutes “essential” and “non-essential”. For instance, a man in Ranchi was battered on Wednesday when he went out to give food to dogs.Similarly, in Mumbai, an event manager was hit by police lathi while taking his sick dog to a clinic. The cop who whacked him remarked, “Here people are dying of corona and you are worried about your pet dog.” IG (Ranchi) and police spokesperson Saket Kumar Singh said arguments and scuffle were a result of confusion regarding what is essential. “Cops have faced such a situation for the first time so there is lack of clarity,” he said. “Public can now send videos to certain WhatsApp numbers if they are harassed by police.” Karnataka has another solution — make those loitering on streets sit in police station all day. Chief ministers of at least two states have intervened, urging cops to cooperate with people. Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray ordered police brass not to use force on those stepping out for essential commodities. In Punjab, CM Amarinder Singh posted on Facebook that “excesses would not be tolerated”. He said it was “overshadowing the good work being done by most”.(Inputs by Ashok Pradhan, Jaideep Deogharia, Rupak Banerjee, Debashish Karmakar, Ahmed Ali)",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74855824,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-396941,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coronavirus-cops-enforce-lockdown-with-blows-insults/articleshow/74855823.cms

28,['28/03/2020'],East Central Railway plans to convert train coaches into moving hospitals,"PATNA: The East Central Railway (ECR) is working on a proposal to convert train coaches into moving hospitals to meet the challenges arising out of Covid-19 pandemic. Officials said Railway Board chairman Vinod Kumar Yadav issued an advisory to all general managers (GMs) through videoconferencing on Thursday.ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar said on Friday that the ECR has assigned the task to several technical experts to work out strategy to execute the proposal. “About 274 mail and express trains and 389 other passenger trains under the ECR jurisdiction have been cancelled till April 14 due to complete lockdown in the country,” he said.The CPRO said the rakes of the mail and express trains lying idle in the yards could be converted into moving hospitals. “This is possible only after making simple alterations inside the coaches. The ECR has 232 stations located in urban, semi-urban and rural areas falling under its five divisions in Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh,” Rajesh said, adding that a moving train hospital could reach any part of the remote areas to serve Covid-19 suspects and patients either in treatment or facilitating their isolation.Danapur divisional railway manager (DRM) Sunil Kumar said railways has skill and competence to convert coaches into moving hospitals temporarily. “Railways could provide facilities like consultation room, beds, changing room for doctors and nurses, medicine storage, pantry car and washroom facilities in a better and hygienic manner. Each train running with a load combination of six to seven coaches could easily provide 300 to 350-bed facilities in any emergency,” he said, adding a mini- ICU facility could also be provided on moving hospital train.“At a time when the country is having limited medical infrastructure and facilities in government hospitals amid the pandemic, the concept of introducing moving train hospitals will prove a boon for the poor people of Bihar in particular. Besides, the moving hospital facility will also serve patients better in the remote areas due to railways’ accessibility,” the DRM said.",patna,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74858290,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-399261,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rlys-plans-to-convert-train-coaches-into-moving-hospitals/articleshow/74853167.cms
29,['28/03/2020'],"No pain, shame if you miss EMIs till May 31","MUMBAI: Borrowers, both individuals as well as businesses, can get a three-month break from their monthly instalments and possibly credit card dues to help them cope with the situation arising out of the Covid-19 crisis. The three-month deferment for instalments due between March 1 and May 31, 2020 will help borrowers remain liquid, avoid the defaulter tag and continue having access to bank credit.Those who choose to take a three-month break from repayments will also not damage their track record with credit information bureaus. RBI governor Shaktikanta Das on Thursday directed banks to ensure that they do not report the delayed payments as a default.RBI’s directions do not specify the kind of loans, but permit lenders across the board — including all types of banks, finance companies, housing finance companies and microfinance institutions — to provide relief to term loan and working capital borrowers.While home loans, auto loans, personal loans and loans against property come under the definition of term loans, bankers are not sure how they will provide relief to those with credit card dues (given the high interest rates) or those who have taken a loan against shares where a fall in price triggers the sale of the security.Banks are advising borrowers who can repay to continue to make payments as there is no waiver of principal or interest that gets capitalised. Many borrowers have given standing instructions for EMIs to be deducted from their accounts. Lenders said that because of the lockdown, it may take time to make changes to their system to enable switching off of the deductions, if requested by customers.“Those who are in a position to pay should continue,” said SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar, indicating that it is a choice that will be given to customers. Kumar said that even if Rs 60,000 crore of term loans got deferred, it would not be a problem as the interest would continue to accrue and won’t effect profitability.However, credit bureaus are saying that borrowers will not lose if they take advantage of the moratorium. “In line with this RBI announcement, we would work closely with our members to define the data-reporting framework on the basis of the announcements made by the RBI governor so that, during the moratorium period, there is no adverse impact on the credit histories and Cibil score of borrowers,” a TransUnion Cibil spokesperson said in response to a TOI query.Other credit bureaus also confirmed that there will not be any adverse impact of holding back on repayments. “The RBI has stated that credit history will not be impacted as the deferment would not be categorised as defaults. We are optimistic that this will address the concerns of the borrowers and help maintain healthy credit scores and financial stability,” said CRIF High Mark CEO Navin Chandani.“A consumer’s credit score is a composite value calculated after taking into account product holding (type of loans and cards one has), leverage and repayment pattern to evaluate credit risk. Currently, we are waiting to see how the EMI repayment moratorium, advised by the RBI, is implemented by the lenders,” said Experian India managing director Sathya Kalyanasundaram. “Given this, Experian will calibrate its scores to ensure that any non-payment due to moratorium is correctly captured and it does not adversely reflect on the consumer’s credit score,” he added.Credit card-issuing banks are waiting for details from the RBI on whether interest relief is part of the package. While the RBI has made it clear that it is a deferment and not a waiver, credit card interest payments are structured around billing cycles with interest waived on the first month’s purchase. Also, credit card interest rates are very high, starting from 24% per annum.In his post-monetary policy meeting address, Das said that all commercial banks (including regional rural banks, small finance banks, & local area banks), co-operative banks, all-India financial institutions, and NBFCs (including housing finance companies and micro-finance institutions) are being permitted to allow a moratorium of three months on payment of instalments in respect of all term loans outstanding as on March 1, 2020.Banks have been asking for this dispensation so that they do not have to classify an otherwise good borrower, whose cash flows have been hit due to Covid-19 lockdown, as a defaulter.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74857855,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-113493,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/no-pain-shame-if-you-miss-emis-till-may-31/articleshow/74855633.cms

There, they had stayed with a close relative, who had returned from the UK on March 16. While on their return journey by Rajdhani Express , they received the news that their UK-returnee relative in Delhi had tested positive for Covid-19. A local source said the group reached Sealdah, from where they boarded Lalgola Passenger to Bethuadahari . From there, they reportedly took an auto home. “The five who have tested positive have all been in contact with a Covid-19 patient. So, the source is known,” said a health department official. The three family members who tested negative would still be kept in hospital isolation, he said.Director of Health Services (DHS) Ajay Chakraborty said, “The UK-returnee relative in Delhi, who is now being treated for Covid-19, is the five’s close contact. On reaching Kolkata on March 20, the group proceeded to Tehatta. Thirteen of them visited the fever clinic at the government hospital in Tehatta. Everyone was immediately kept in isolation and samples of eight, who showed symptoms, were sent for test. Five turned out to be positive.” The Nadia district administration declined to comment, saying they were waiting for instructions from the state health department.According to a source, around 30 family members had gathered in Delhi on March 16 to welcome their relative from the UK. The two girls’ father, who is posted in Uttarakhand , returned to their home there, though the rest decided to visit their ancestral home in Tehatta. The 11-year-old and his family live in Delhi; but the mother-son duo also took the Rajdhani to go to Tehatta.The nine-month-old girl was probably the second-youngest Covid-19 patient in India, an eight-month-old girl from Jammu and Kashmir assumed to be the first, a state official said, adding that treating the child might be a challenge as she being less than five-year-old has a weaker immunity system than the others.This coincided with the condition of the 66-year-old Covid-19 patient in the city deteriorating further on Friday. The Nayabad resident has been on ventilation from Thursday night. Doctors said he had developed lung problems, which was not a positive sign. “Covid-19-induced pneumonia has set in. It is a matter of concern. The patient continues to be in critical condition and is on life support,” said Sudipta Mitra of Peerless Hospital, where the elderly man is admitted.The patient had been on oxygen support since March 23, the day he was admitted to the hospital. As his oxygen saturation level kept dipping despite the support, the doctors put him on ventilation on Friday night. The patient has been on anti-retroviral drugs from Friday, hours after he tested positive. “Best efforts are on to save him. In addition to the anti-retroviral drugs, other supportive medicines are also being administered,” said Mitra.The conditions of all the other eight Covid-19 patients being treated at ID Hospital are stable, none requiring any breathing assistance.“All the patients are doing fine.

One of such creative mind is Ankita Khatri, a homemaker who interacted with Prime Minsiter Narendra Modi through video conferencing on March 25. She caught PM’s attention with her creative thought “Jo Rachta hai Wo Bachta hai.” Appreciating her thought, the PM also shared it on his twitter handle saying “An interesting perspective on how young India can take the lead in battling COVID-19”.

“A creative person can’t sit idle. We need to channelize our creative energy for the benefit of the society in such a critical hour. I am using the #Corona_Crises Days for cooking goodies for family members,” said Ankita appealing to her friend circle to share their creative ideas too. She posts, “Please share how you are spending your quarantine period, use #Kuchh_Creative_Karo_Naa”. “I feel so delighted to see how Ankita took up the issue of protecting from the adverse effect on mental and emotional health during these days of corona crisis,” said her husband Manish Khatri, a creative art professional.

As the temples are closed for the devotees, many of the priests and mahants have come out to do service to the ‘Daridra Narayan’ (the poor) by providing meals to them in this hour of crisis. “We have opened our kitchen to prepare food for the people in need and those trapped in the city due to lockdown,” said mahanth of one of the most crowd pulling temples -Sankat Mochan Temple, Vishwambhar Nath Mishra, who is also a professor of electronics at IIT (BHU). “We distribute food packets at the ghats and other places,” he said adding that it is the grace of god that no one goes empty stomach in this temple town.

His younger brother Prof Vijay Nath Mishra, a neurologist at Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, also devotes his time in providing help to underprivileged apart from discharging his duty. Apart from this, he has also connected himself online with others to play quiz on different topics.

“I have started online quiz to engage my Facebook friends to shun the anxiety and dullness of the lockdown before going to bed,” said Mishra adding that the activity has received a good response from people, who want to sharpen their general knowledge and IQ in these hours of leisure. Similarly, Dr Subodh Kumar Singh, a noted plastic surgeon who had reconstructed cleft of the lead character of the Academy Award winning documentary ‘Smile Pinki’, is treating patients through telemedicine. “We are serving the needy people who cannot come to the hospital in this hour of crisis. For example, I got a call on Thursday from a 16-year-old girl from a village of Ghazipur district. She sustained second degree burns on her face after hot cooked pulses from cooker fell on her,” he said adding that he advised her proper medication after examining her burns through video call by phone. “It was a great sense of satisfaction for me when I saw that the girl’s parents and family members were convinced,” he said.

Similarly, volunteers of Vishal Bharat Sansthan, a social organisation, could be seen busy in cooking meal and preparing food packets at Subhash Bhawan in Lamahi, the ancestral village of great author Munshi Premchand. “We have started a kitchen to prepare food for those trapped in different places due to lockdown. The district administration has issued passes to our volunteers for distribution of food packets wherever needed,” said VBS founder and assistant professor at BHU Dr Rajiv Srivastava. Besides, ‘Anaj Bank’ run by the organization has also made arrangements with helpline numbers to supply food to those in need, he said adding that the service would continue until the crisis is over. Similarly, there are several others who are actively discharging their social responsibilities in this hour of crisis. District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma, who had earlier appealed to the civil society to come forward to help others, said that people working to help needy would be provided all support.

Vadodara: If you thought that gathering in garden of your apartment instead of venturing out on the roads will save you from police action during the lockdown, then you may be in for wrong.

Police ave started keeping an eye on different areas through drones fitted with high-definition cameras. Police will monitor citizens roaming in narrow lanes or common plots in residential colonies and book the offenders.

“Social distancing is a must. But many citizens are not still not taking it seriously. We learnt that residents of apartments hang out in their common plot and in the old city people roam around in the lanes,” said Jaydeepsinh Jadeja, DCP (crime).

Many citizens also come out on the roads in groups under the pretext of buying vegetables. “We will capture vehicle number through drone cameras and track down such persons. The drones will take photos of people moving around in common plots of their apartments and FIRs will be registered against all such persons,” Jadeja told TOI.

On Friday, the cops flew drones in Alkapuri and Karelibaug.

Police has stepped up action against the citizens by detaining over 351 vehicles from different areas. Vehicles of those who were out on the roads without any plausible reason were detained and 19 persons were booked for flouting section 188.

“Almost every main road in the city has been barricaded and we are intercepting every commuter to ascertain if they are out for genuine reasons,” said a police official.

Some citizens, however, are complaining that the cops are not allowing them to move despite giving genuine reasons.

Although the government has exempted insurance services from the curfew, instructions have not percolated down to the police to allow movement of TPA staff.Meanwhile, banks are finding it difficult to operate their call centres at capacity given the lockdown and are asking customers to use mobile apps for self-service. “To ensure customer and employee safety, we are working remotely. We encourage you to use digital channels,” SBI Card wrote to its customers. Citibank said that it was limiting its call centre services for emergencies and asked customers to use the app. HDFC Bank said that it has restricted voice support to its PayZapp customers for PIN reset and hot-listing only.Raksha TPA CEO Pawan Bhalla said, “We have enabled work-from-home for our 150 doctors for authorisation of cashless claims. But we still need to man our IT and call centre services.” Bhalla said that he has already written to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India ( Irdai ) and to the General Insurance Council about the problem that they are facing.In the private sector, ICICI Lombard and Bajaj Allianz general insurance companies have such teams within the company. “We conducted a drill on March 19 and 20 to see if we can do total work-from-home if the entire city was under lockdown and have arranged for employees to have laptops and connectivity from home. The focus has been on ensuring that the IT system is up and running at all times,” said Bajaj Allianz chief risk officer Rajeev Kumar.“We have arranged for the calls to the centre to get transferred to employees who now work from home. The priority is for health insurance customers. For others like motor insurance, we have created digital modes of interaction,” said ICICI Lombard General Insurance executive director Sanjeev Mantri.Raksha managed to clear around 150 cashless procedures on Tuesday. “Our operations were scattered to network with the hospitals. We are now creating three hubs in Delhi, Indore, and Bengaluru,” said Bhalla. Another challenge for Raksha TPA is procuring IT hardware to enable people to work from home. “We have found a provider who has the laptops. But getting them is a challenge,” said Bhalla.In his address to the nation on Tuesday, the Prime Minister asked citizens to avoid elective healthcare procedures that could be postponed during the coronavirus crisis.Raksha, which is the largest TPA, has not seen a single Covid-19 case come up under mediclaim . “Right now, most of them are being treated in government hospitals. I spoke to some of the hospitals that had created private facilities for treatment.

“We have offered our aircraft and crew for any humanitarian mission that the government needs us to fly. We are already flying food, medicines and medical equipment for government everyday (on our freighter aircraft),” PTI quoted SpiceJet’s CMD Ajay Singh as saying on Friday. “We would like to alleviate the suffering of the migrant workers, especially those from Bihar, by flying some flights between Delhi/Mumbai and Patna,” he added.

SpiceJet operated a special chartered flight from Delhi to Coimbatore on Friday on the government’s request.

Patna airport director Bhupesh CH Negi told this newspaper that the airport premises is available for any flight to land here.

However, a SpiceJet executive at Patna airport said they have not received any information regarding any special flight.

Meanwhile, Lok Janshakti Party president Chirag Paswan wrote a letter to CM Nitish Kumar on Friday and appealed him to bring back people from Bihar, who are stranded in other states amid the lockdown.

At present, no international or domestic passenger flights are allowed to operate in the country. However, cargo flights are exempted.

Meanwhile, people stuck in other states are still hesitant to book train and flight tickets for fear of further reschedule post April 14.

Girish Singh, who works for a private company in Mumbai, said he rescheduled his flight to April 17 after the lockdown was announced on March 24. “Now, I’m in a dilemma to extend my travel plan or just wait and watch the situation,” Singh, a resident of Lohanipur, said.

Aman Deep, who studies in Punjab, said he had to cancel his flight ticket for March 25 as the airports were shut down. “Now, I have to decide whether to book my ticket for April 15 or not. I really want to return home,” he said.

41,['28/03/2020'],Tata Motors to hive off passenger vehicles unit,"MUMBAI: Nearly three decades after it entered the passenger vehicles business, the $44-billion Tata Motors said on Friday that it will transfer the India unit to a separate entity. The move is a precursor to bring in a strategic partner in the loss-making passenger vehicles unit to secure its future. Tata Motors’s passenger vehicles business has been hit by weak sales and production disruptions amid an economic slowdown and the coronavirus pandemic.The company, India’s third-largest passenger vehicles maker, will be transferring the car business — including employees and manufacturing facilities — to the new subsidiary on a “slump sale” basis. Slump sale means transfer of a division of a company for a lump sum without assigning any values to individual assets and liabilities of the entity. However, certain shared services and central functions, said Tata Motors, will remain with the company to “deliver cost efficiencies” to the entire automotive business.Passenger vehicle sales in India declined for the last 16 months till February. Now, with the country under a 21-day lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak, sales have come to a halt. “The recent outbreak of the Covid-19 virus increases the challenges faced by the business,” said Tata Motors, which has scaled down production at its various facilities after the government directed closure of non-essential businesses.The transfer, added Tata Motors, will help in providing “differentiated” focus to the two businesses — commercial vehicles and passenger vehicles — and will help “each of them realise their potential”. Tata Motors is the largest player in commercial vehicles in India, a business it launched in 1954 in financial and technical collaboration with Daimler of Germany.On the other hand, the company has been struggling in passenger vehicles, which clocked just 5% market share in February. In the past, Tata Motors shareholders had expressed their disappointment over the poor performance of the passenger vehicle business to the company’s board at several annual general meetings, with some calling for drastic measures. A couple of years ago, Tata Motors and Volkswagen explored an alliance to develop an economy car. But the alliance didn’t materialise.The move towards “subsidiarisation” of the passenger vehicle business, said Tata Motors, was “the first step” in securing strategic alliances, which will provide the company access to “new products, architectures, power trains, technologies and capital”.The transfer proposal will be tabled before the Tata Motors’ board in the coming weeks and its implementation will be subject to approval from regulators, shareholders and creditors. The entire process, said Tata Motors, will be completed in fiscal 2021. The new subsidiary will be headed by Tata Group veteran Shailesh Chandra from April 1. Currently, the passenger vehicle division is steered by former Maruti Suzuki marketing chief Mayank Pareek, who will superannuate from Tata Motors next February.The two, said Tata Motors, will work on the transition over the next few weeks, which will also give Chandra, who previously worked closely with former Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata’s office, “the opportunity to shape the organisation” once all approvals are in place.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74858549,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1247223,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tata-motors-to-hive-off-passenger-vehicles-unit/articleshow/74855595.cms
42,['28/03/2020'],RBI goes abroad to stem rupee volatility,"MUMBAI: Going beyond the country’s borders to stem exchange rate volatility, the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) said that Indian banks will be allowed to trade in rupee derivatives offshore. This marks a change in strategy for the central bank, which has until now been trying to bring all rupee trading to Indian shores at the international financial centres.The rupee recovered sharply to close at 74.95 on Friday, up 38 paise from its previous Thursday close of 75.33, buoyed by RBI’s measures to support the financial markets.The non-deliverable forward (NDF) market refers to the trading in rupee derivatives in offshore centres like Singapore. In this market, banks place bets on what the value of the rupee will be in the future. Unlike domestic forward markets where the seller has to deliver rupees on the effective date, in the NDF market the trade is settled in dollars by converting the value of the rupee on that day.RBI officials have said that during times of uncertainty, like the 2013 ‘taper tantrum’, the onshore exchange rate was influenced by these offshore NDF trades . Since no rupees are involved, the RBI cannot control these markets. The Indian central bank had been trying to get foreign banks to trade in rupee derivatives in India.Now the RBI has changed its strategy by allowing domestic banks to participate through their International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) Banking Units (IBUs) in the NDF market with effect from June 1. Indian banks can also participate through their foreign branches. “This will help improve an avenue for local participation in the offshore markets and, over time, likely narrow onshore vs NDF spreads. This also will be a channel to control volatility during instances of heightened market stress,” said DBS economist Radhika Rao.A panel headed by former RBI deputy governor Usha Thorat in 2019 had recommended the deepening of the local markets to counter the NDF market. “Over time, therefore, it would be imperative for the Indian regulators to take steps to expand the role of onshore currency markets gradually, lest the disjointed price discovery issue flares up more frequently and in larger degrees,” the report had said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74859197,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-50848,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-goes-abroad-to-stem-rupee-volatility/articleshow/74855684.cms
43,['28/03/2020'],"SBI passes on entire benefit, cuts lending rate by 75 bps","(Representative image)

MUMBAI: State Bank of India (SBI) has passed on the entire cut in interest rates by the RBI to its borrowers by bringing down its external benchmark-linked lending rate as well as the repo-linked lending rate by 75 basis points (100 bps = 1 percentage point) from April 1. The bank has also brought down interest rates on deposits by 20-50bps. The interest rate on bulk deposits has been brought down by 100 bps.

The move comes on the back of the RBI making available to banks Rs 3.74 lakh crore through a host of measures. The reduction has brought down interest rates on home loans by up to Rs 30 lakh to 7.95%. SBI said that it would factor in the loan-to-value, whether there is a woman borrower and the risk grade of the borrower before arriving at the final rate.

Typically, other banks follow the SBI in both lending and deposit rate cuts.

While the reduction in rates is positive for borrowers, those depending on fixed deposit will see a sharp drop in their earnings. With uncertainty in the markets resulting in the bank getting more deposits than it can deploy, SBI cut its short-term fixed deposit rates (7-45 days) to 3.5% from 4% earlier. This is the second cut in deposit rates this month with the earlier cut taking place on March 10. The highest return that the bank offers is 5.7% on all deposits over a year. On bulk deposits, the highest return is 3.7%, which in real terms (after adjusting for inflation) is negative.

Earlier this month, SBI reduced its interest rates offering 5.9% at its highest maturity. Incidentally, this is lower than the 6% that Kotak Mahindra Bank is offering on savings deposits of over Rs 1 lakh. Addressing newspersons, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said that despite uncertainty, the bank was seeing healthy growth in deposits. “We are not seeing any unusual movement in withdrawals,” he said.

44,['28/03/2020'],West Bengal to test hospital staff only with contact proof,"KOLKATA: The health department has refused to accept swab and blood samples of health workers from a private hospital, which is now treating Covid-19 suspects and has several nurses and ward attendants with symptoms.Two nurses from the hospital — both of whom had been admitted with severe cough and respiratory distress — have tested negative this week, prompting a state Covid-19 nodal officer to inform the hospital that they must provide proof of contact with positive patients to get health workers’ samples tested in future.While the hospital authorities claimed this was a wrong interpretation of the ICMR guidelines for the Covid-19 test and could lead to a proliferation of cases, health officials pointed out that limited resources made it mandatory to stick to the rule.“Our doctors and nurses are risking their lives by treating suspects every day. They are forced to interact with not just suspects, but also their family members who might be infected as well. So, if their samples are refused, many positive cases could remain undetected, which is dangerous for it will lead to transmission,” said a hospital official. More than a dozen samples from Covid-19 suspects from the hospital have so far tested negative.A health department official, on the other hand, pointed out that ICMR guidelines did not permit testing samples of those without a history of contact. “Supply of test kits and other resources are limited and must be used judiciously. So we are going by the ICMR guidelines,” he said. The official added that thousands suffer from cough and cold at this time of the year and do not require tests.However, he admitted that leaving out health workers could be risky. “They are at the front line and have a greater risk of contracting the virus. But I guess we have no choice,” he said.Pulmonologist Raja Dhar felt that, along with the lockdown, the city needed more testing facilities for Covid-19 to flatten the curve of this pandemic. “We need point-of-care testing (POCT) to ensure that community spread has not started. The process of private hospitals sending specimens for testing needs to be streamlined as well. This will improve the private-government partnership on controlling this epidemic,” said Dhar.According to its initial testing strategy, ICMR had said that only those with symptoms and travel history and those who have come in contact with people who have a travel history would be tested for Covid-19. The rule was later expanded to include asymptomatic, direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case. These people are now eligible to be tested between day 5 and 14 of coming into contact.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74860071,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-357103,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-to-test-hospital-staff-only-with-contact-proof/articleshow/74854866.cms

Besides, Sudha milk booths are functional in every nook and cranny of the city,” PDP manager (marketing) Arvind Kumar Sinha told this newspaper on Friday.He added, “We have definitely witnessed a fall in demand for ‘lassi’ and ice-cream, but people are buying milk and curd.”Talking about the precautionary measures being taken at the factories, Sinha said, “We always maintain hygiene, but extra precautions are being taken now. I, therefore, request our customers to buy milk and other products without hesitation. They should, however, clean the milk packets with warm water.”Another PDP employee claimed that more customers were visiting booths located in small lanes and residential societies. “People are hardly going to the booths on main roads during the lockdown. They are buying dairy products from local shops,” he said.Meanwhile, city residents and dealers have heaved a sigh of relief because of the uninterrupted supply of milk. “Although there has been a surge in demand for all essential commodities, I am getting milk without any delay,” said Jaya Gupta, a resident of Jagdeopath.Danapur-based dealer Pintu Kumar said, “The demand for dairy products, especially milk and curd, has increased extensively.

46,['28/03/2020'],"Supply hurdles, lack of transport put brakes on pharma industry","Panaji: The coronavirus pandemic and the nationwide lockdown imposed to curb its spread has placed Goa’s pharmaceutical sector under a cloud. Though classified as an essential service, the industry faces disruption due to supply-chain hurdles and absence of transport for employees.

Goa has around 75 licensed pharmaceutical manufacturing units and employs anywhere between 10,000 to 12,000 workers. The sector accounts for 11% of India’s pharma exports, and yet, at a time when life-saving drugs are vital, the sector finds itself in a dilemma, say stakeholders.

“Pharma is an essential service as per the Centre’s directions, and the sector is not asking for any special exemptions when we ask to remain operational. We are supposed to run at 100% because we are an essential service but this week, people worked for just one day,” said Dr. Praveen Khullar, president of Goa Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (GPMA).

When the state government announced on Sunday that the janta curfew would be extended by three days, GPMA decided to support the initiative. However, once the lockdown was further extended, GPMA asked its members to take the final call.

According to officials, around 80-90% of Goa’s drug manufactures have either temporarily shut down or have reduced the manpower to undertake just 25% of the operational capacity.

“Around 80% of pharma companies agreed to close down for seven days as requested by the government, while those who had ongoing process chose to continue. Presently, we have asked our members to slow down, run single shifts, rotate people and take precautions,” Khullar said.

The Indian Pharmaceutical Association recently highlighted the mistreatment of pharmaceutical industry workers by police. The body has also drawn attention to supply chain disruption and has warned that there could be drug shortages in a month if the concerns were not resolved.

In Goa, pharma employees are being stopped at checkpoints or are being ostracised in their villages for working.

“I haven’t gone to work for the past three days because of the police blockades and safety issues. Some of my friends from Usgao and Madkai have been stopped in their villages and warned that if they go to work, they should not return home,” said a woman employed with a multi-national drug manufacturer.

Out of the 75 licenced drug manufacturers, Goa is host to 35-odd multinational pharma firms, including Cipla Limited, Lupin Ltd, Sanofi India, Wyeth Lederle Ltd,Merck India Pvt Ltd, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals and Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd.

Many of these companies formulate vital drugs such as antibiotics, cardio-vascular medicines, cholesterol drugs and even the anti-malarial hydroxychloroquine.

“Doctors and nurses are risking their lives for the patient, but a doctor cannot do anything without medicines. The pharma sector provides support and medicines. There are certain things which are not a luxury, such as diabetes medicines,” said Khullar.

KOLKATA: A Pawan Hans helicopter took off from Kolkata on Friday morning for a marathon sortie with two refuelling stops to reach Tripura with an important consignment of medicines for treatment of Covid-19 patients there.

A flight from Kolakta to Agartala usually takes one-and-a-half hours. But with passenger fights, which go over Bangladesh, being shut after the lockdown, the helicopter chartered by the Tripura government to transport the medicine will reach Agaratala 18 hours after it took off from Kolkata at 10.30 am. The helicopter would take a circuitous route via Bagdogra and Guwahati. In its hold was 350kg medicine, mostly hydroxychloroquine, that is being used to treat Covid-19 patients.

The helicopter carrying the consignment did not fly over Bangladesh with a refuelleing stop-over in the country but chose to skirt it and fly over the what is being referred to as the chicken neck, virtually travelling the land route.

India has prohibited export of hydroxychloroquine and its associated formulations and also prohibited its over-the-counter sales, making precriptions a must.

We don’t know anyone in the city and have no money and food. We did not get any help from the administration,” he said.“When we pleaded for the vehicle, they asked us to pay Rs 6,000 for the ambulance service. It is not possible for us to pay that much money. We had got the ambulance at Biharsharif Sadar Hospital without any charge from where we brought her here yesterday,” he added.Sanju, wife of Feku Paswan, was admitted at PMCH on Friday at 1pm and she died after a few hours. The woman was taken to PMCH from Biharsharif Sadar Hospital at 8am when Sanju complained of stomach- ache and breathlessness.Her father Suninder Paswan, mother Usha Devi and uncle (chacha) Hridey Paswan accompanied her to PMCH from Nalanda in an ambulance provided by Sadar Hospital.

After the lockdown, we were unable to get the required medicine,” she added.“Since last night, the pain was unbearable for her. In the morning, we admitted her to VIMS from where she was referred to Sadar Hospital and then to PMCH, where she passed away. We could not even perform her last rites properly,” Chandani said over phone from Nalanda.PMCH superintendent Dr Bimal Karak did not respond to the messages sent for his reaction.Authorities on the other hand, advised people to follow social distancing guidelines in cremation and burial as well.Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, Patna divisional commissioner told this newspaper that for the final funeral procession to crematorium and burial ground, the residents have to coordinate with the local police station with their respective areas.“For burial at graveyard, local committees help the people for all arrangements whereas for cremation at ghats, the PMC provides assistance.

PATNA: All political parties, irrespective of their ideologies are coming forward to extend their support to battle the Covid-19 pandemic.

RJD has offered to make a part of its state headquarters at Beer Chand Patel here, a quarantine centre or an isolation ward for Covid-19 diagnosis and treatment. “A newly developed shed in the party headquarters here has a capacity of over 500 people and a large number of beds can be put in it, whenever needed. Besides, there is sufficient availability of basic amenities including water, electricity, generator sets and lavatories on the premises. Party state president has sent a proposal to the state government that if it wants, then it can use this area in our party office,” RJD spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said.

RJD national vice-president and former CM Rabri Devi also wrote a letter to Vaishali district magistrate on Friday to inform that she has recommended a funds of Rs1crore from her legislators' local area development fund to be utilized for treatment of Covid-19 cases and procurement of medical safety kits, including testing kits, sanitisers, mask, hand wash and thermal scanner among others.

(Contributions by Namrata Singh in Mumbai, Udit Prasanna Mukherji in Kolkata, John Sarkar in New Delhi & Avik Das in Bengaluru)

MUMBAI: Even while retailers continue to deal with logistical issues in the procurement of essential products, a problem of liquidity has surfaced for small grocery stores A grocer in Mumbai said distributors are not accepting cheques for larger sums mainly because banks, which are under-staffed due to the lockdown, are not clearing them. Some grocers do not have RTGS (real time gross settlement) facilities either.While there has been a situation of stock unavailability post-lockdown, small grocers said they are finding it difficult to source supplies from company distributors due to liquidity issues. This is another reason why grocery stores have been under-stocked in the last few days.However, corporates like ITC, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) and Cargill are extending a helping hand in these challenging times.Piyush Patnaik, managing director of Cargill’s oils business in India, said, “Kiranas will run into trouble due to two reasons — logistical problems in delivering stocks to them, and lack of cash in the market. Our distributors are extending credit to kiranas and we are doing it for our direct customers.”An HUL spokesperson said the company expects the prolonged lockdown to impact the cash turnaround time of its distributors. “We will continue to evaluate the need for extending credit to our distributors from time-to-time and take appropriate actions in the best interest of our business and the partners with whom we work,” said the spokesperson. Previously, corporates had extended credit lines to their distributors during the demonetisation exercise in 2016.Small retailers in Mumbai said some distributors, as a norm, do not accept cash beyond Rs 15,000-20,000, and now even cheques are not being accepted. These retailers said they were rushing to register for RTGS facilities — a process which can take a long while.In Kolkata, some stores, mostly hyper-local, are facing problems procuring commodities from bigger stores and sell it with a small mark-up. However, relatively bigger kirana stores are in a better position. While most deal in cash, some are getting credit from distributors.There are around 12 million kirana stores in India, according to Nielsen, and close to a million wholesalers that make up the lifeline of the $650-billion retail industry. The relevance of small neighbourhood stores has remained steady given familiarity and proximity factors. Some even extend monthly credit to consumers.Naren Sen, a hyper-local kirana store owner in Paikpara area of Kolkata, is facing a tough time for the last few days. “A lot of people in the neighbourhood are making purchases on credit, but we are not getting credit. The big stores and sub-distributors are not ready to accept cheques either,” he added. However, Milton Chakraborty, who has a relatively bigger grocery store in Kasba area in south Kolkata, is getting credit from distributors.An industry executive said distributors of companies like ITC, which has a strong presence in kirana stores, is extending line of credit to these stores. “There is not much cash crunch at this moment, though most of the kirana stores do not have RTGS but they are getting credit,” the executive said.In east Bengaluru, a majority of the neighbourhood stores remained shut on Friday due to lack of stock, and those that were open operated only between 7 am and 1 pm during the day due to low replenishments from distributors. All received their delivery last week and are waiting to refill as shelves remain half empty due to panic-buying by customers this week.“There has been no supply since last week,” said a kirana store owner, who pays his distributors in cash and online. “We are yet to reach a situation of paying by cheque or RTGS currently as that will only happen when the next cycle of delivery occurs,” he added.A local ICICI branch manager said the bank has not received requests from any store owners for access to RTGS facilities. “It needs an approval from the RBI. Under the current situation, it is not likely they can leave their stores and come to the bank for that,” said the manager.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74859563,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-412020,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/kirana-stores-find-it-hard-to-pay-for-stock/articleshow/74855578.cms

CHENNAI: Cognizant Technology Solutions on Friday announced that it will pay a ‘gratitude’ allowance of 25% of basic pay to more than 1.35 lakh employees in India. This is being paid recognising their efforts at maintaining business continuity during the coronavirus pandemic.

“In recognition of the extraordinary continuity-of-service efforts of our associates in India and the Philippines, and as a tangible sign of our gratitude for their perseverance, we will provide those at the Associate level and below with an additional payment of 25% of their base pay for the month of April. This will be processed with your April paycheck, and we will be reviewing this approach monthly,” CEO of the company Brian Humphries said in a mail to employees.

The company’s overall India head count is 2,03,700 as of December 2019 and nearly 1.35 lakh of them are in the rank of ‘Associates’.

In the past few weeks the company has enabled a majority of its offshore delivery teams to work from home by provisioning new laptops and encrypting desktops and moving them to your homes, as well as by enabling the use of BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), providing additional bandwidth connectivity and air cards—all with the appropriate client permissions and security protocols.

“While working from home may amount to a significant shift in behavior for many of you, please continue to keep up the essential work you do for our clients,” Humphries said in the communication.

Earlier this month, the company announced that it will reward its employees with a bonus payment in the range of 35% to 95% of the promised sum, its lowest ever for fiscal 2019 (the company follows a January-December fiscal year). For nearly 80% of its India-based employees the bonus is between 65% to 95%.

“The morale of many employees was down as the bonus payout was very poor. Maybe this is just to assuage their feelings,” an employee told TOI on condition of anonymity.

KOLKATA: At a time when doctors and nurses treating Covid-19 patients are fighting a daily battle—at hospital and in neighbourhoods, where they have been ostracized for “handling infection”—a final-year student at Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute ( SRFTI ) convinced her father to give out their two flats rent free to these health workers.After the 26-year-old made a post on the social media, two doctors and a nurse got in touch with her on Thursday. Suchana Saha had been upset ever since she read about the humiliation and abuse that the frontline health workers treating Covid-19 patients faced. Her businessman father owns two flats in Nagerbazar that had been given out on rent till six months ago. “On Thursday, I asked my father if we could give them out to accommodate displaced doctors and nurses treating Covid-19 patients. This will be our small contribution in the fight against the virus. We will not take any rent from boarders,” Saha said.Her father, Pranab Kumar Saha, was more than happy to help out. His only condition has been that the two flats will be given to only “displaced doctors and nurses handling people infected with novel coronavirus”. “I own two of the 16 flats in a building. When my daughter came up with this idea, I got in touch with the person who handles the matters related to those flats. He promised there would be no problem if these flats are given out to boycotted doctors and nurses,” he said.Since Thursday, Saha’s post had been shared 1.4k times. “Some doctors even called up saying they would pay rent. But we said we would not take the payment as it would defeat the purpose,” he added.One of the callers was a nurse from Uluberia who works at a state-run hospital. “She told me she had been putting up at the hospital for two days. Two doctors from private hospitals have also got in touch. I have asked them to visit with ID-proof documents,” she said.Since the flats have not been in use for six months, they need cleaning and sanitization before use. Suchana’s brother, Swarnabh, next-door neighboor, Tapasi Mondal, and cook, Jyotsna Mondal, helped her in the first round of cleaning. “My ISC has just got over. Way before the lockdown started, my sister cautioned all of us at home about how this disease might impact us. It was her idea to give out these flats,” said the 18-year-old, picking up a broom to clean the flats.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74857389,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-193061,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/girl-offers-no-rent-flats-to-ostracized-docs-nurses/articleshow/74854906.cms
55,['28/03/2020'],Auto component industry to pay its 1 lakh temp workers full March salary: ACMA,"Chennai: Around 1,00,000 contractual blue collar workers working in auto component factories will get their full salary for the month of March ahead of their salary deadline of April 7. Around 100 auto component companies affiliated with the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association (ACMA) will pay these contract employees their full March wages on or before March 31, said Deepak Jain, president of ACMA. Discussions are currently on for the next wage cycle as well. “The sector is looking at zero retrenchment and full wage support for the contract labour force,” said Jain. Auto factories, both component and vehicle making units, have significant contractual labour force. In a normal downturn, these contract workers are benched and retrenched and do not get paid for factory shut downs.

ACMA has also created a taskforce which is evaluating the possibility of manufacture of facemasks, hand-sanitisers by its members. “Several of the component companies have shown keen interest to manufacture these items and specifically, for ventilators, members are evaluating the option to import them through their CSR funds,” said Jain.

Auto component industry, which clocked a revenue of $26 billion in the first half of FY20, is taking a hit of Rs 1,000-1,200 crore per day of the lockdown. Currently, said Jain, the main concern of auto component companies, particularly tier-2 and tier-3 vendors, is lack of cash flow. “While the RBI loan moratorium and the FM’s GST payment extension will help, steps like postponement of utility bill payment, relaxation of working capital loans and relaxation of port demurrage charges due to the lockdown will help,” said Jain. The auto component sector contributes 2.3% to India’s GDP, 25% to national manufacturing GDP and employs over 50 lakh people.

56,['28/03/2020'],Strict vigil to enforce lockdown in districts,"CHHAPRA/ BHAGALPUR/ NAWADA: Authorities and officials across the state are taking a slew of measures for preventing the spread of Covid-19 as well as enhancing medical facilities to tackle the pandemic.

At Chhapra, the Saran district administration has started a disaster relief center on the premises of Jai Prakash Institute of Technology for people facing difficulties in reaching their destination due to the lockdown.

Senior officials in Saran district administration said that altogether 36 persons have been provided food and accommodation at the relief center since Thursday. “People from different districts have come here and many of them are dailywage earners,” an official said.

Saran district administration has also taken several steps to ensure that people stay in their houses and those found loitering on different streets have been either asked to return to their house or have been taken to task. Altogether 2,158 persons have been quarantined in 33 different schools, home and isolation centers in Saran district.

DM Subrat Kumar Sen has directed the foodgrains and grocery shop owners to open their establishments between 6am to 6pm only and to procure necessary permits for movement of vehicles carrying food grains. FIRs have been lodged against 15 shopowners involved in hoarding and black marketing of food grains.

Steps for strict implementation of lockdown are being taken by the Bhagalpur district administration also. Bhagalpur SSP Ashish Bharti is personally supervising the lockdown in the district and has also ordered the SHOs of police stations to enforce social distancing among the people, who come out on streets to buy essential day-to-day commodities.

Altogether 30 magistrates have been deployed in Bhagalpur town to enforce the lockdown and announcements are being made on public address systems urging the residents to remain indoors and not to take advantage in the name of buying groceries and other exemptions.

DM Pranav Kumar said that a ‘special control room-cum-Covid-19 cell’ has been formed to monitor the situation and complaints related to Covid-19 spread and lockdown. Bhagalpur SSP Ashish Bharti said police are working round-the-clock for manning the streets and commercial establishments selling essential commodity for maintaining social distancing.

At Nawada, identification and surveillance of around 4000 persons from outside the district, state and country is posing a tough task for the officials. Over 69 persons arrived from different countries, of which 39 are senior citizens. In a respite, 40 persons who returned from abroad have tested negative for Covid19-free and have been reunited with their family. So far, nine suspected cases have been referred to nearby Pawapuri Medical College and Hospital in adjoining Nalanda district, who later tested negative for the virus.

Considering a large number of arrivals, Nawada DM has deputed district education officer (DEO) to get such persons screened by doctors and if necessary, quarantine them at numerous isolation centers and hotels. “Around 125 doctors have been roped in for this gargantuan exercise. Efforts to rope in private doctors are on the anvil,” DM Yashpal Meena said.

57,['28/03/2020'],Shops selling cattle feed to remain open,"PATNA: In a bid to ensure uninterrupted supply of fodder for cattle, the state’s crisis management group (CMG) headed by chief secretary Deepak Kumar on Thursday allowed shops selling cattle feed and fodder to remain open. Transportation of fodder and cattle feed will also be allowed.

It was also decided at the CMG meeting that agricultural workers would be allowed to harvest rabi crops like wheat, oilseeds, pulses and maize in April-May wearing masks and maintaining “social distancing”. Agriculture department director Adarsh Titarmare issued the necessary directive in this regard to the DMs and SPs of all districts.

“We issued the directive to the DMs and SPs on Thursday itself,” AHRD director Vinod Singh Gunjial said, adding, “As humans need food and nutrients for survival, so does the livestock population. Besides, the supply chain of milk and other products has to remain functional and unbroken.”

Farmers in the state were spending sleepless nights apprehending scarcity of cattle feed and fodder amid lockdown to prevent spread of coronavirus. They also supply milk to Sudha Dairy booths. The farmers have also been doing livestock farming of goats and other animals.

“It is six days since the lockdown began in the state on Sunday. During this period, our stock of cattle feed and dry fodder like ground hay stalks has almost depleted. Even private sellers of dry fodder have stopped bringing these items on their trailers and tractors to villages due to the lockdown,” said Akhilesh Kumar Singh, a resident of Chandwa village under Falka block in Katihar district.

58,['28/03/2020'],PMC sanitation worker thrashed by cops,"PATNA: Adding to the reports of police highhandedness in enforcing the lockdown across the state, a Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) sanitation worker was beaten up by cops near Jethuli under Fatuha police station in Patna district on Friday.

The victim, Sahendra Ram, was on his way to ward number 22 in Pataliputra circle of the corporation to report for duty when he was stopped by police personnel at Fatuha and was thrashed with batons resulting in multiple injury marks on his body.

This is third incident of police highhandedness in Patna in the past few days. A sanitation worker was thrashed by police at Gaurichak on March 24. An inquiry is being conducted by Patna Sadar SDPO Kiran Kumar Gorakh Jadhav. ADG (Headquarters) Jitendra Kumar had taken cognizance of the March 24 incident.

On Thursday, three police constables were arrested after they allegedly shot at a truck driver while trying to extorting money from him at Danapur in Patna. The truck was transporting potato which falls under essential supplies category.

PMC commissioner Himanshu Rai told TOI over phone that he met Patna DM Kumar Ravi on Friday morning after the latest case came to light on Friday.

“On DM’s direction, a message was flashed via wireless to all police stations in Patna that sanitation workers must not be stopped or thrashed. Earlier, I also brought the matter to the notice of SSP and other senior police officers after another sanitation worker faced police’s wrath at Gaurichak on Tuesday. They also assured me of proper action,” Rai said.

He added, “Sanitation workers and the police both are playing a major role in this situation prevailing across the country and both are working day and night.”

The PMC commissioner further said, “Once police constables down the line get sensitized, such incidents won’t take place anymore.”

He added, “The DM took the issue very seriously. He has assured that no such incidents would take place in future. Police have been instructed that no such incidents must be repeated otherwise stern action would be taken against those found guilty.”

City SP (east) Jitendra Kumar said an inquiry is going on in the Gaurichak incident. “While the victim had alleged that he was thrashed by police going to duty, police personnel had denied it,” Kumar said.

He added, “We had met the victim. Sadar SDPO is conducting an inquiry. He is looking at CCTV footages. Necessary action will be taken after he submits the report.”

59,['28/03/2020'],DM forms 12 teams to enforce lockdown,"PATNA: Patna DM Kumar Ravi has formed 12 separate teams headed by additional district magistrate and deputy collector-rank officers for effective enforcement of lockdown .

These teams will also handle home quarantine, medication, transportation, information technology and supply chain aspects apart from supervising isolation centres.

The lockdown enforcement cell quarantined nine people, including five women, in the Buddha Smriti Park on Friday. These people had reached Patna from different places to teach meditation and yoga. Cell’s nodal officer Krishna Kanahiya Singh said the nine had reached the city on March 17.

“They were requesting us to make arrangements for their return. However, keeping in mind the current situation, they were quarantined,” Singh said.

Patna DDC Richie Pandey, the nodal officer of home quarantine enforcement cell, said all those who had been stamped with ‘home quarantine’ mark were being contacted. “We will ask them to stay indoors at least for 14 days. We have a database of all such people,” Pandey added.

Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said the newly constituted cell comprises police officers, doctors, administrative officers and others. “Similar teams have been formed in other districts too,” Agarwal added.

Special passes for vehicles carrying essential items: The state government has started issuing special passes for inter-district movement of vehicles carrying essential commodities after proper scrutiny of applications. The officials concerned are also quizzing the applicants on various aspects before issuing the passes.

State transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said passes are being issued only for inter-district movement of vehicles carrying essential commodities, including cattle feed. “There is no need of special passes for vehicles moving on highways carrying essential items,” he added.

Meanwhile, the administration also issued a special pass to a couple on Thursday to bring their daughter back from Kolkata. “The couple was issued the pass in a special case as their daughter was stuck in Kolkata,” an official said.

60,['28/03/2020'],"Stocked up, but most Posta shops stay shut","Kolkata: Nearly 60% of wholesale outlets in Posta, the largest wholesale hub in eastern India, remained shut on Friday, signalling it may take some more time for food supplies in the retail markets to return to normal. The wholesalers TOI spoke to said there were hardly any labourers to assort, package and load the goods on vehicles. There were also no vehicles to ferry commodities to retail markets.

In the absence of adequate number of goods vehicles, several shop owners from different markets reached Posta on their bicycles and two-wheelers to ferry huge sacks of rice, flour, maida, sugar, oil, potatoes and onions, making multiple trips throughout the day.

Traders said they were in the process of hiring locals to compensate for the labourers who have left for their native places once PM Narendra Modi announced a three-week lockdown.

“Initially, we had planned to reopen the market on Monday but when The CM requested us not to delay any further, we changed our decision and reopened from Friday itself. But we are facing massive problems because there are hardly any labourers and vehicles. We have to assort and package thousands of sacks of edibles which cannot be done without the labourers who left for their native places in Bihar and UP. But we are trying to open the entire market very soon,” Biswanath Agarwal, secretary of the Posta Bazar Merchants’ Association.

But the demand in the retail markets has been on the rise, prompting many shop owners from nearby bazars to reach Posta on their bicycles and two-wheelers. Most of them made multiple trips to Posta throughout Friday to ferry flour, rice, pulses and sugar. Manish Gupta, who has a grocery store near Ram Mandir, reached Posta at 9am on his bicycle with one of is worker. By 4pm he had made three trips ferrying nine sacks of flour, rice and pulses. “People are coming and enquiring after every few hours. Earlier, I would call up the wholesaler and they would send me the goods on a vehicle. Today, the wholesaler said I must bring my own vehicle but none was available, so I decided to use my bicycle,” said Gupta.

Wholesalers said they had enough stock in their godowns, but absence of labourers and goods vehicles was creating a problem. “The labourers were staying here even after a lockdown till March 31 was announced. But as soon as the three-week lockdown was announced, they immediately left. There is still enough stock but nobody to package and deliver,” said Vineet Agarwal, a sugar wholesaler.

PUNE: Close to 19 ,000 people, mostly migrants who returned from Mumbai to their villages in Junnar taluka before the nationwide lockdown was imposed, have been put under home quarantine as a precautionary measure in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak.

Junnar tehsildar Hanumant Kolekar said the administration has formed 40 teams for regular health checks of these people. Most of them travelled by public transport and vehicles carrying vegetables from markets in Mumbai.

“The taluka has 184 villages, several hamlets, spread across hilly areas. The sources of livelihood are inadequate. Most of the people from Junnar work in big cities such as Mumbai and Pune. Our teams are visiting them every day,” he said.

At present, over 20,000 people are under home quarantine in rural Pune, said chief officer Ayush Prasad of the Pune zilla parishad . “Early detection of the virus-affected case, if any, is our first and foremost priority in the district. We have accordingly formulated our strategy. The Kerala government also managed to control the situation because of this tactic in their rural areas,” he said.

“Asha workers were working in tandem with the primary health centres across the district. We have specifically told them to inform those in charge of the health centre if they come across any person with symptoms such as cough, cold and fever. Our health centres are equipped with ambulances to shift patients, if needed,” Prasad said.

“We have categorically told them not to restrict or ban entry to native person returning from cities like Pune and Mumbai. But for such people, home quarantine is mandatory, “ Prasad said.

The ZP has also told gram panchayats to create awareness about the virus. “We do not allow people to gather at the main square, which usually gets crowded” Sanjay Duandkar , a grampanchayat member of Shel Pimpalgaon village in Khed tehsil, said.

At 3pm on Thursday, a team headed by deputy commissioner of police (crime) Bachchan Singh and senior inspector Arun Waykar — acting on reliable information — raided the godown, near Ladkat petrol pump at Narpatgiri Chowk, and seized 17,805 masks.

Police said as per the godown’s inventory, the stock of masks had been hoarded since March 21. According to police, Gupta wanted to create an artificial shortage in the market, where there is a high demand for masks in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak, and sell them for a higher price than MRP.

PUNE: The fields in Pune district are full of crops ready for harvest, but there’s no one to cut them as most farmhands have gone back to their native villages following the Covid-19 outbreak.

With hardly any worker available to reap the harvest, farmers fear that their produce will go to waste. Moreover, traders who collect the produce from the farmers have stopped coming after the lockdown came into force, fearing police action.

Sunita Daphal from Mulshi said that after cutting the rice crop, many farmers in Mulshi produce vegetables like tomato, cucumber and coriander till monsoon. “These crops are ready for harvest, but workers are not available to cut them. With three or four family members, it is not possible for us to cut and bring the produce to the city,” he said.

Hanumant Phuge from Nimgaon Indapur taluka said, “I produce vegetables and fruits. Everything will rot as there’s no one to cut the crops,” Phuge said.

He said that every day he cuts vegetables required for his family and goes home. “The government should do something about it,” Phuge said. At Aba Kale’s seven-acre farm in Solapur ’s Madha Taluka a crop of muskmelon is ready for harvest.

“It is not possible for me or my family members to cut the produce and sent it to the market,” he said.

PUNE: The city can expect more supply of vegetables as sub-markets in Moshi, Khadki and Uttamnagar have started functioning at full capacity, while the one at Manjari that was closed for two days will open on Saturday.

These markets supply vegetables and fruits to nearby retailers. The markets received less supply of vegetables for the past two days, while Manjari market remained closed.

The main wholesale market at Gultekdi had also been closed since March 25 after the traders and commission agents refused to work because of the novel coronavirus scare.

The officials of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) of Pune said markets will begin full-fledged unloading of vegetables and fruits by Saturday and added that steps were being taken to resume unloading and sale of vegetables at Gultekdi market from Sunday.

“The leafy vegetables are not fresh and those available are costly. We are left with no choice but to purchase potato, onions and tomato,” Megha Raje, a Shivajinagar resident, said.

A vegetable vendor from Aundh Road said supply on Friday had increased compared to the previous two days.

Vendors were also selling vegetables in tempos and handcarts in many areas of the city. “I purchased vegetables from Khadki market in the morning and will visit the residential areas nearby,” Kiran Dhakude , a tempo driver, said.

Meanwhile, officials from APMC said farmers will be able to bring their produce to Gultekdi market from Sunday. “We are expecting traders to resume transactions. If they do not, we plan to make adequate arrangements to unload vegetables sent by farmers and sell them to retailers,” an APMC official said.

The APMC on Friday said around 100 tempos carrying vegetables were unloaded at APMC despite the absence of traders. While traders in APMC Mumbai have resumed work, a similar decision is expected in Pune, a source from APMC said.

PUNE: The city police on Friday started issuing passes to delivery personnel of various app-based food aggregators.

“For now, we are issuing a limited number of passes to each service provider based on a preliminary assessment of area-wise requirement,” joint commissioner of police Ravindra Shisve told TOI. Police have turned down requests for transferable passes to enforce social distancing.

The state government decided to allow reopening of eateries as part of its measures to ensure maximum essential services are made available to citizens so that they do not need to step out during the lockdown.

Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar was informed of the inconvenience people have been facing in trying to source cooked food during a meeting with officials on Friday. Pawar was told this was one of the main reasons why people stepped out.

Pawar asked hoteliers to provide delivery services at the gates of housing societies. He also instructed cooks and delivery personnel to take proper precautions and maintain hygiene.

Shisve said the Pune police were trying to ensure minimum inconvenience to the public. “We have been sensitizing policemen and public at more than 180 checkpoints since March 25,” he said.

Services of the officials who have prior experience of working during outbreaks of infectious diseases may come in handy if Covid-19 spreads further.At a corona preparedness review meeting held on Thursday, South Delhi Municipal Corporation SDMC ) commissioner Gyanesh Bharti directed all the deputy health officers of the four zones in south Delhi to prepare a list of the retired employees who are healthy.A senior public health official said that services of retired malaria inspectors, assistant malaria inspectors, senior malaria inspectors and other personnel have been utilised to control dengue in the past. “The civic bodies are discussing the idea of utilising services of retired corporation employees to deal with corona crisis on a contract basis. The retired people will supervise the work of domestic breeding checkers and nala beldars,” another official added.According to a official, SDMC has so far deployed 200 doctors, 750 nurses and over 1,000 domestic breeding checkers in various jobs, including contact tracing and sanitisation, to deal with the pandemic.“The staffers are busy sanitising parks, quarantined homes, offices and markets. We need people in supervisory roles to streamline the functioning of the field staff. Only retired people who are healthy will be engaged so that no one is put to risk,” the official said.The civic body has also started to train nala beldars for sodium hypochlorite sprinkling and disinfecting an area using knapsack pumps.The problem of shortage of staff in public health department across all three corporations is not new. The public health department of erstwhile unified MCD was expanded rapidly in 1978-79 when city faced a massive malaria crisis. But with large number of retirements of those recruits in last few years many of these posts are lying vacant. Some of the key posts like anti-malaria officers, senior malaria inspectors, malaria inspectors, assistant malaria inspectors and senior field workers witness over 50% vacancies.“These officers supervise the field staff, coordinate with RWAs and citizen groups, monitor the functioning of domestic breeding checkers, ensure fogging and fumigation, issue challans and prosecute violators.

Insurance coverage is also available for Covid-19 treatment at select private hospitals. Although patients prefer being admitted to private hospitals, but as of now, none of the private hospitals has neither treated nor been approached by people showing alleged symptoms of Covid-19.A spokesperson from a corporate hospital at Ramnagar said: “We have five isolation beds and at our Railway New Colony branch, 32 isolation beds have been kept ready.

Varanasi: Following the appeal of clerics and health guidelines for social distancing, most people offered namaz at their homes on Friday. Almost all mosques in Varanasi, Jaunpur and other districts wore a deserted look. Only those who look after the mosque affairs were present there to offer namaz.

Though most of people followed appeals and instructions of offering Friday namaz at home, there were some who, without caring about social distancing, reached mosques. Around 6-7 people reached Laat Maszid in Saraiyya locality to offer namaz and despite of having a huge space, did not follow the norm of keeping a safe distance from each other.

Shahar-e-Mufti Maulana Abdul Batin Nomani had made an appeal to the community to not to go to the mosques for Friday namaz and offer namaz at their homes. In his appeal, he said that people should maintain social distancing in view of corona threat, hence they should offer namaz at home only.

Most mosques in Jaunpur including Atala Masjid were closed. Notices suggesting to offer namaz at home was also pasted at the mosques.

Meanwhile, in Gorakhpur Muslims offered Juma Namaz at home while only 5-7 people could be seen offering namaz at mosques. Meanwhile, Durga aarti was performed at Gorakhnath temple by chief priest Kamalnath in the presence of some Sanskrit Vidyalaya students chief Pujari, on the third day of Navratra on Friday.

“The temple used to witness a huge crowd for Durga aarti during Navratra but this year aarti was performed with only 5-7 Sanskrit Vidyalaya students due to threat of corona virus,” said Vinay Gautam, a staff of Gorakhnath temple.

Most of the prominent mosques followed norms for social distancing while offering namaz but some ignored the norm despite of huge space. Imam of Jama Masjid in Gorakhpur, Maulana Abdul Jalil Mazahiri, appealed people to remain at home during lockdown and said that Juma Nnamaz could be offered at home even with three people.

Following the appeal, Muslims offered namaz at home. “ We are facing pandemic and following the rules is very important to combat the virus. I offered namaz at home and prayed for the health of my countrymen. In my entire life I had never seen such a situation,” said 60-year-old Zakir Khan of Jafra Bazar area.

“Only 5-7 people including Imam and people related to management of mosque offered Juma namaz at mosques. In shariyat this is known as ‘Ehtiyati Tadbeer’,” he added.

The inmates raised slogans demanding parole as is being done in prisons of other states.

Jail authorities quelled the commotion by explaining that the inmates were much safer inside their cells than outside, in society. “All precautions for their safety have been taken within the jail premises since response to Covid-19 became a reality,” said an inspector general of prison official.

The official said the commotion began in the morning when prisoners were let out between 9am to 1pm. As a precautionary measure, he said, “Prisoners are left out for longer duration from their cells since the last two weeks. They must have watched the news about the status in prisons of other states and demanded they be given parole,” he said. He did not rule out a possibility that the inmates may have been incited by some co-inmates.

“Since last few weeks we have stopped visitors to the jail. Patrolling staff has been reduced to half, to reduce density of persons on duty at a time,” the official said.

The Colvale prison currently has about 540 inmates, including under-trials and the jail has a capacity to accommodate 100 more.

“Unlike other prisons in the country, our prison is not over crowded,” the official said. Hand sanitisers have been provided to inmates and staff on duty while thermal guns are being used to keep track of body temperatures .

“Fifteen to twenty inmates are accommodated in one cell but since the outbreak of the disease, jail inmates have been instructed to maintain distance of one meter even when they are sleeping,” the jail official said.

New inmates or those who have returned from parole are kept in isolation. ""With so many people living under one roof, it does increase the risk of infection but we are taking precautions. Two persons who returned from parole recently have been kept in isolation,” he said.

The jail has about ten isolation cells that are used to isolate any prisoner for 15 to 20 days who is a termed a trouble maker. Those cells are now being used to isolate prisoners who have come back to the facility. There is an in-house doctor to check prisoners. In addition, video conference and teleconferencing facility is offered to jail inmates. “We always had this facility but it was not used much. They can avail this benefit now,” the official said.

77,['28/03/2020'],Sealed border chokes edible oil flow in Pune,"Representative image

PUNE: The supply of edible oil to Maharashtra from neighbouring Karnataka has been hit with the border between the two states being sealed in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak and the ensuing nationwide lockdown.

Senior officials in the Maharashtra revenue department said the two state government were in talks to resume the supply at the earliest.

Maharashtra depends on the Virabha region and Karnataka for edible oil. Supply has been halted in Vidarbha because the drivers and workers were not reporting to work. Edible oil is also not reaching from Karnataka ever since the inter-state border has been sealed.

An official said panic buying by a section of the consumers aggravated the crisis and efforts were on to streamline the situation within two days.

“There’s s no need to panic and supply of all essential supplies, edible oil, vegetables and fruits, will be streamlined. It is just the initial teething problems after the lockdown was imposed. The process to send out essential supplies is on after thorough scrutiny,” the official said.

B V Mehta , executive director of the Solvent Extractors Association of India , told TOI that the ongoing crisis was due to the logistics issue. “I think the district administration is on the job and the supply will be shortly streamlined. People should not panic,” he said.

Mehta said Maharashtra procured coconut oil is procured from the southern part of the country and rice bran oil from northern India. As the nationwide lockdown was imposed, all inter-state borders were sealed.

“All states are now slowly sending out essentials. The country’s demand is about 230 lakh tonnes of edible oil and India produces around 75-80 lakh tonnes. The country imports about 150 lakh tonnes of edible oil to bridge the gap between demand and supply,” Mehta said.

There are a huge number of plants with a capacity from 50 tonnes per day to 1,000 tonnes per day producing different kinds of oil, depending upon the availability of seeds in an area. Major refineries are located near ports across the country.

“The current issue is that of logistics. Edible oil produced in the factories need to be moved first to the depots, then to wholesellers and finally to retailers. The Centre, states and local authorities are helping the industry resume production and maintain the supply chain. There is no restriction on inter-state movement of essential commodities. Once the logistics are in place, we do not fear any supply hassles,” Mehta said.

As on date, no one is sure about how long this lockdown will continue. During the lockdown, no activity of holding public hearings will be conducted. So, the power tariff hike, if at all allowed, will be only after July — that is based on the assumption that the coronavirus threat is over,” said highly-placed sources.Senior officials of discoms are meeting on March 30 to discuss whether the aggregate revenue requirement (ARR) submission to the Telangana State Electricity Regulatory Commission (TSERC) on March 31 should be delayed given the prevailing situation. Also, a decision would be taken whether to send the current meter readers to the doorsteps of the consumers for meter reading and raise bills or send bills to consumers based on their average bill payment in the last two to three month in view of the lockdown.“KCR should extend property tax due date from March 31 to May 31 and also provide relaxation for payment of electricity bills till May-end without any penalty,” Telangana Youth Congress spokesperson SP Kranthi Kumar said. He sent an email to the CM in this regard.The hike in power tariff would have allowed the discoms to raise an additional Rs 1,500 crore per annum. Last time the power tariff went up by 7% was in 2016 and this time it was proposed to seek a 10% hike.The southern and northern power distribution companies have to submit their ARRs, after which TSERC will decide how much tariff hike would be allowed after conducting a public hearing. The discoms are unlikely to submit ARRs by this month-end.As it is, collection of property tax in the current fiscal in gram panchayats and urban local bodies except GHMC has been hit due to the lockdown.

Nagpur: With five new Covid-19 positive patients detected on Friday, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) started spraying disinfectant in Khamla, adjacent areas, and also main roads across the city to control spread of the virus. Also, door-to-door containment drive has been widened to detect vulnerable patients.

Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe held a review meeting of all heads of departments and kicked-off spraying of disinfectant. He has instructed NMC’s fire department to provide fire tenders to spray disinfectant. The drive will be undertaken in association with officials of health department and ten zone offices.

Deputy commissioner Dr Pradeep Dasarwar told TOI, “NMC is spraying sodium hypochlorite, which is a chemical compound of sodium cation and a hypochlorite anion. In homes, we usually disinfect using phenyl. Similarly, NMC is spraying this chemical compound on streets. It will help control spread of Covid-19 and other viruses,” he said.

Chief fire officer Rajendra Uchake told TOI, “Eleven fire tenders have been pressed into action, of which six have capacity of 5,000 litres and five of 2,000 litres. They will work in all 10 zones. One each is from Civil Lines fire station, Ganjipeth, Cotton Market, Sugat Nagar, Lakadganj , Kalamna, Trimurti Nagar, Sakkardara, and two from Narendra Nagar fire station,” he said.

Fire department personnel started spraying disinfectant using hose pipes of the fire tenders right on the streets.

On Friday, TOI had reported similar spraying of disinfectant was launched in Wardha. Probably, Wardha was the first to launch it in Vidarbha.

NMC assistant commissioner of Laxmi Nagar Zone Raju Bhivgade said, “Khamla Road and other streets of Khamla and Pande Layout were covered on Friday night. Remaining areas will be covered from Saturday onwards,” he said.

Throughout the day on Friday, NMC sanitary workers sprayed disinfectant in interior lanes of Khamla manually. All lanes near the residence and shop of the positive patient were covered.

NMC zonal medical officer Dr Sunil Kamble said, “NMC’s door-to-door containment drive covered around 6,000 houses within 1km radius from the house of positive patient in Khamla. At the same time, we covered more than 11,500 houses in Bajaj Nagar, where the first three positive patients are residing and Swawlambi Nagar. We visited houses of the maids of Khamla positive family. We learnt she works in two more homes. We sent all of them to GMCH for testing,” he said.

Kamble added all suspected people in Khamla and nearby areas will be sent for testing. “We will expand survey to houses in 2km radius on Saturday, and 3km on Sunday,” he said.

The drive also continued in other zones of the city. Over 70,000 houses have been covered in the remaining nine zones.

NMC had claimed Khamla positive patient came to fore during its containment drive. When they learnt of his symptoms, the NMC team asked the person to visit Mayo Hospital on March 23. Accordingly, he and his family members went to Mayo Hospital on Wednesday.

NMC is probably the first in the state to launch door-to-door containment drive.

He said, “Students studying in Classes I to VIII in schools that come under our department will be promoted to the next class without appearing for the annual examination this year. Though we have not issued any notification in this regard, we are planning to do this in view of the difficult situation that has arisen out of Covid-19.”

Earlier, there was a system to auto-promote students from Classes I to VIII. For this academic session, the school and mass education department had decided to introduce the pass and fail system for students of Classes V and VIII. It had also conducted the half-yearly examination for the students of these classes.

“But this system can not be implemented this year. We have to postpone the pass-fail system for Classes V and VIII this time. The current situation has forced us to think of promoting the students of these classes without making them appear for an examination,” he added.

On March 13, chief minister Naveen Patnaik had announced to close schools and other educational institutions after the World Health Organisation declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic on March 11. Later, the school and mass education department had on March 16 postponed the examinations of all the classes starting from Class 1 to IX and Class XI as a preventive measure to contain the Covid-19 outbreak.

Sources said the schools in the state will reopen after the summer vacation is over in the third week of June. Last year, the government had shut the schools for summer vacation from April 18.

PUNE: State transport minister Anil Parab on Friday said a decision on allowing the passage of trucks stranded on state borders was yet to be taken.

The announcement came two days after the state transport department’s claim of having adequate measures in place to help the stranded truck drivers in the wake of lockdown in the country. The department had said that food joints along the check-posts were being kept open for the benefit of these drivers.

“At present, no trucks transiting through the state or carrying non-essential items are being allowed to ply. Only trucks with essential commodities are allowed to pass,” Parab told TOI on Friday.

“Decisions pertaining to these issues are being taken in a phased manner. If we allow all trucks, the purpose of lockdown would be defeated,” he said, adding decision to open food joints for such stranded drivers was yet to be taken.

The president of Vahan Chalak Malak Pratinidhi Sanghatana, Baba Shinde, said, “If the transport authorities have said trucks would be allowed to ply, then where is the government resolution? At present, thousands of trucks carrying non-essential items are stranded across the state borders. No food joints have been opened for them. We have sent two letters to the minister of road transport and highways and are trying to speak with Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari .”

There are nine major check-posts across Maharashtra — Thane, Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon, Nagpur, Kolhapur, Solapur and Sindhudurg.

Kulktran Singh Atwal, president of All India Motor Transport Congress , said, “Centre has allowed plying of trucks ferrying essential commodities but the order is yet to be communicated with many states.

PUNE: The state government and district administration are working around the clock to ensure uninterrupted supply of vegetables, fruits, oils, pulses, foodgrains, but their efforts are being stymied by an unavailability of workers .

With many workers having returned to their villages, the administration is trying to reach out to them and get them to come back to work so that the essential goods are supplied on time.

Nitin Pawar, state convener of Hamal Panchayat , said over 50,000 workers are employed in various sectors. “When the state went into lockdown, most of them returned to their villages. Now it is difficult them to return, but those who are available locally are now being pressed into service,” Pawar said.

Pune collector Naval Kishore Ram said they were working towards addressing this issue.

Pawar further said the government too needs to consider providing insurance cover for these workers.

“While the health workers are being covered, why not extend it to those delivering the essential services?” Pawar said, adding they have sent this demand to the government.

“Wages too should be given properly as there are many workers who have no food or shelter. There should be a health check-up of workers ferrying essential goods,” Subhash Lomte , general secretary of Maharashtra Rajya Hamal Mapadi Mahamandal , said.

A grocery shop in the city said it was looking to provide its own manpower to ensure loading and unloading goods at Gultekdi market.

GANDHINAGAR: The lockdown for the Covid-19 pandemic may lead to a revenue loss of Rs 3,000-4,000 crore to the state, sources in the government said on Friday. Lower GST collection stemming from complete shutdown of manufacturing and service sectors, drastic reduction in income from electricity duties, and lack of real estate transactions will take their toll, sources said.

“Revenue collection under various heads increase in March due to the end of the financial year. But this time, GST collection is expected to drop sharply and the Centre’s share will also plummet. The shutdown in real estate and other sectors has stifled income from stamp duty and registration fees,” said a senior government official. He said the government is also staring at a drop in revenues generated from sales of motor vehicles, and electricity duty from from industries.

“Collectively, the loss of overall income of the state government may extend to Rs 3,000-4,000 crore,” he said.

The official said the possibility of reduction in grants-in-aid from the central government can’t be ruled out as the Union government will also be facing similar reduction in revenues. “Things will be clearer only after the lockdown is lifted and tallies made,” the official said.

Sources added that the impact of the lockdown may last for about two quarters after the lockdown period and state government revenues will continue to be hit for some time. “The state government may have to borrow more money to fund the state’s planned expenditure as budget allocation has already been announced. The government may also have to announce additional resource allocation after the lockdown is over,’’ said an official.

In the women and infants’ ward of the hospital, around 30-35 people were present inside a 16x14 room with a capacity of six beds. While two pregnant women were lying on their respective beds, their kin were occupying the area near the bedside. Some were even sitting on the floor.Further, at a time when an infectious disease is rampant and cleanliness should be paramount, the sainitation in the wards left much to be desired. Also, there were no sanitisers available for patients and their attendants and the washrooms in the ward didn’t have soaps.When asked about this situation from hospital doctors, they expressed their helplessness saying that even after repeated requests and warnings, the kin of patients are not ready to leave the hospital. They added that the hospital got burdened after the women’s ward of Government Doon Medical College and Hospital was shifted here two days ago.“We have asked the kin of patients several times to leave the rooms and sit in the rest area on the ground floor but they hardly pay heed to our requests. They are risking the lives of their own kin.

91,['28/03/2020'],Odisha: Prisoners being moved to jails with less occupancy,"The Jharpada circle jail in Bhubaneswar

BHUBANESWAR: To decongest jails in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak, the state government on Friday started shifting at least 856 convicts from different districts to prisons with low occupancy. The fresh move came a day after the government constituted a high-powered committee to facilitate early release of prisoners on parole and bail to decongest jails.

The 856 convicts, who were lodged in 18 jails at different places in the state, are being relocated to 17 less congested prisons. Though jails in Odisha are not overcrowded, the high-powered committee decided to shift the convicts to those prisons where the presence of inmates is less. Against the sanctioned capacity to accommodate 19,791 inmates, all 87 jails in Odisha currently house 18,112 prisoners, including 14,387 undertrial prisoners (UTPs) and 3,725 convicts. A few months ago, the state prisons directorate had proposed to the home department to close 18 jails due to low occupancy of inmates.

“We have started the process of shifting convicts from jails in Bhubaneswar, Choudwar , Berhampur, Bhadrak, Phulbani, Sambalpur, Sundargarh , Baliguda , Jajpur, Athagarh, Bhawanipatna, Dhenkanal and Angul where the capacity and existing strength of inmates are either same or a little less. We identified 17 jails in different districts where less number of inmates stay compared to the sanctioned capacity,” director general of police (prisons and correctional services) Santosh Kumar Upadhyay told TOI. Significantly, the three-member high-powered committee having chairman of Odisha state legal services authority, state home secretary and DGP (prisons and correctional services) as members has finalised modalities for release of convicts and UTPs. Sources said the committee has also asked under-trial review committees in all districts to hold weekly meetings and facilitate measures for release of prisoners.

“We gave special remission of two months to 126 convicts on Friday. That means they have been released from jails two months before the completion of their sentence,” Upadhyay said. Jail sources said different courts have granted bail to at least 60 prisoners on Wednesday.

Upadhyay said the committee laid emphasis on providing prompt healthcare facilities to sick prisoners. “We have supplied adequate hand sanitisers and masks to jails. State and district-level monitoring committees are being constituted for proper implementation of the decisions. Chief district medical officers have been requested to boost requisite healthcare facilities in jails and conduct awareness programmes among inmates,”Upadhyay said.

94,['28/03/2020'],Birders to take up isolation as ‘Lockdown Bird Challenge’,"Nagpur: With the country under Covid-19 lockdown , eBird, an online database of bird observations, has turned the compulsory quarantine into a positive contribution by organizing ‘Lockdown Birding Challenge’ by recording birds around homes.

The challenge begins from March 27 till the lockdown ends. Birders in the region are excited to be part of the event.

The count will be related to information about bird species sighted near homes, habitat and their behaviour. There may be several species that must not have been recorded before. Birders will record species by standing exactly 15 minutes at the same place in four slots every day.

At your home, from Friday until the lockdown ends, we need to look for birds in the time slots every day from 4am to 6am (optional), 6am to 9am, 4pm to 7pm and 7pm to 10pm (optional).

“The purpose of the pre-dawn and the night lists are to document early-rising birds and nocturnal species , respectively,” says Sarang Pimparkar, a city birdwatcher from Pannase Layout, who is excited about the event.

The complete lists with identity of birds have to be uploaded to the eBird platform (ebird.org/india). As with our other birding challenges, all those who manage to meet the target will be named on this website, and one among them will be chosen at random to receive a small gift in appreciation.

“The relative lack of noise is a good opportunity to try out some bird sound recordings using your smartphone. Alternatively, we will be able to record videos on our camera,” says Azra Taiyeb , who runs a school in Yavatmal and is into birding for past several years.

“We have sprawling residential premises with different tree species. Many birds are spotted on our premises and I maintain a diary about it. The lockdown challenge will help me upgrade my birding skills,” Taiyeb added.

“Due to road development, many trees have been cut in the last few months. I’m witnessing lot of bird activity at my place since then,” she said.

Ashwin Gharote, a birder from Sonegaon, said, “I will conduct the survey from my balcony. Due to the lockdown, people are not going for birding and this is the best way to record them. I will also record their calls.”

“If flocks of birds flying towards their roosting sites in the evening are seen, then this will be marked as ‘Flyover’. We also have to mention the direction of birds’ flight and those feeding on a flowering or fruiting tree nearby,” says Omkar Kekre, a birder from Ramdaspeth .

Kekre said, “Our house is old and has trees on the premises. This makes it a good habitat for house sparrows besides birds like robin and red vented bulbul. Many of our resident birds have already started their breeding activities.”

By gathering and storing bird sightings, eBird enables the gathering of baseline data on bird distribution and abundance, and disseminates this information for public and scientific use.

“Birders use eBird to upload and maintain their bird records. For each bird list, details of date and location are given, and ideally the ‘effort’ spent birding. Bird lists are useful to understand the distribution and seasonality of birds,” says bird expert Nitin Marathe.

MSU on Thursday had issued a circular asking deans, principals, directors, coordinators, section heads among others to seek virtual consent from their staffers for donating one day salary in CM Relief Fund as a voluntary contribution to fight the battle against COVID-19.

The circular, however, had led to confusion as it had stated: “The names (department wise) of only those members of MSU family who do not want to contribute can be sent to director, computer centre with a copy to registrar and vice-chancellor by email only (sic).”

“If they are seeking voluntary contribution, why do they require names of those who don’t want to contribute?” questioned a temporary staffer.

The deterrent came ahead of Friday prayers and on the third day ‘Chaitra Navratri’.

Meerut’s superintendent of police (SP) Ajay Sahni said, “There are some notorious elements who are trying to deliberately violate the lockdown. There is a provision of punishment for up to two years in Disaster Management Act. If the lockdown norms are violated at any place of worship, action will be taken against cleric or priest concerned.”

The appeal is seen as another step to discourage devotees from attending Friday prayers and visiting temples during the ongoing ‘Chaitra Navratri’.

This week, three clerics in Bulandshahr and one if Meerut’s Sardhana area were booked for holding evening prayers in mosques. Several religious leaders have also come forward and appealed to the people to stay in homes and respect social distancing.

The appeals were recorded and shared widely on social media platforms. In most parts of the country, Friday prayers were not held, barring a few exceptions.

Most of the mosques in Meerut and other neighbouring districts like Muzaffarnagar, Bijnor, Baghpat, Hapur and Bulandshahr were shut and an appeal was posted at the main entrance requesting people to offer prayers at home.

However, in Shamli, an Imam was among three booked for lockdown violation after people gathered for namaz at a local mosques. More than 2,500 cases have been registered against people found violating lockdown in the state.

In the absence of public transport system, heart-wrenching visuals of families walking their way home are coming to the fore. Some of them are determined to walk over 100km to “save themselves from starvation” as they are out of job now.

On Friday morning, a fleet of 10 such government buses chugged off from Bijnor station for Ghaziabad to bring home scores of people stranded in the industrial city.

A similar exercise has begun in other districts of the state as well.

Assistant regional manager (ARM) of Bijnor roadways Vinod Kumar Maurya said, “Officers of Ghaziabad administration called up their Bijnor counterparts asking them to rescue workers of the district stranded there. We have sent ten roadways buses to Ghaziabad to bring them home. A similar arrangement has been put in place in other districts also. This emergency service was launched on Friday.”

Sunil Kumar, a labourer stranded in Ghaziabad, told over phone, “I worked in Delhi. The factory where I was employed was shut down due to the lockdown. That is why I want to travel to my village in Bijnor.”

PRAYAGRAJ: After receiving intelligence reports that owners of medical stores are causing unnecessary crowding in wholesale medicine market on Leader Road, police authorities have roped in two additional teams to regulate assembly in the area.

These retailers have also been asked to follow norms like wearing mask, maintaining social distance and use sanitisers and gloves.

President of Allahabad Chemists & Druggist Association Anil Dubey said despite being asked to book their orders between 11am and 2pm and ensure deliveries from 3pm to 6pm, retailers were not following the appeal and reaching Leader road in groups for purchase of medicines .

“When the appeal was ignored by retailers, we shut our shops and refused to deliver drugs to them,” a wholesaler said.

Senior police and administrative officials interacted with office-bearers of the Allahabad Chemist & Druggist Association and decided to deploy additional mobile police pickets to regulate sale and purchase of medicines.

There are over 200 medicine shops dealing in wholesale business at Leader Road and retailers from various districts reach here to buy medicines.

Police have also advised traders dealing in wholesale to open shops alternatively to avoid rush and fix a proper time for delivery.

Harsh Mehrotra, a wholesale drug dealer at Leader road told TOI, “As additional police pickets are being deployed and police are strictly enforcing lockdown rules, those who have booked orders on phone or online are being asked to come to Leader Road to get deliveries.”

“We have also been making arrangements to dispatch orders to retailers,” he added. Meanwhile, retailers are also facing problems as people are asking for medicines for three months despite the fact that doctors have not prescribed for it.

Chemists said they were not in a position to provide medicines for months as they had limited stock.

Bhopal: “Three different birds wake me up every day. I am not skilled enough to identify them, but this new morning routine filled with the chirping of birds is absolutely delightful,” says Nirali Singh, a resident of Kolar.

With humans cooped inside amid the lockdown, the stillness on the streets is encouraging birds to step outside.

“There is a fallow patch of land next to our apartment building and I never noticed that there are atleast eight different types of birds there. I am trying to look them up on the internet to identify them. Bird watching is very therapeutic, especially in a time like this I think we all need it,” said Singh.

“You can hear so many different birds now. A ‘kee-kee’ here a ‘tch-tch-tch-tch-tch’ there. I do not know whether it is because the number of birds have increased or is it because we are noticing them more,” says Rita Shrivastav, a resident of Bagmugalia and an amateur birder.

“Birds have always been around. Because of the drop in noise levels, we can hear them more. On an average, we can spot 25-30 species of birds from out home only. Especially now that they are stepping out more,” says Mohammed Khalique of Bhopal Birds.

“Every where in social media, people are posting how birds are more visible and more active right now. Even the common birds can be seen playing about, their activity has increased,” said Shomi Gupta, a bird enthusiast.

“There are some birds which are shy and even when around us hide in bushes or leafy tree. But, now as there are no vehicles moving or people walking about, they do not mind coming out. Bagmugalia earlier had a lot of trees, but now a lot of houses and apartment complexes have come up. This is birds’ natural environment, now that we are inside, they are coming out again. This is the case in other locations as well. Nature resets itself when left untouched,” said Shrivastava.

Many ‘balcony birders’ of Bhopal have spotted common birds like house sparrow, common myna, red-vented bulbul, Asian koel, laughing dove, can be seen in groups of twos and threes hopping about. Other local species like black drongo, ashy prinia, purple sunbird can also be spotted from your balcony or backyard.

Pradeep Ghosh, a resident of Shakti Nagar, spotted a family of peacocks. “A few days ago, we heard a very different sound in the morning and we went to our backyard to check. There is a green belt of BHEL behind our house and there we spotted two peacocks and three peahens. They were there until afternoon. I have lived in this house for 40 years and have never seen this. It was amazing.”

This is also the spring season. Flowering trees in Bhopal like — jacaranda, mango tree, cassia, semal, jarul attract birds, specially song birds, said the expert.

“To encourage more people to start bird watching and also find a new hobby during the lockdown, we have asked residents to send us photos and videos of the birds and their calls that they can spot from the comfort of their homes. We are calling this the home bird count. Through this, families can come together and participate in this activity and also connect with nature while staying safe in their homes,” added Khalique.

Birders’ delight

Some local species of birds, you can spot from your balcony include sparrow, myna, red vented bulbul, laughing dove, spotted dove, collared dove, babbler, ashy prinia, purple sunbird, yellow sunbird, rose-ringed parakeet, Asian koel, hornbill, black drongo, magpie, red-wattled lapwing

Private doctors and their association are adhering to government guidelines and reiterate that ‘people without an emergency should stay indoors’.

Elderly, who are said to be the most venerable to Covid-19, comprise 7.2% of the state’s seven crore plus population. Over 5 lakh people are predisposed with diabetes, common cancers and other ailments as per government data.

On any given day, about 0.5% people of the state capital’s 20 lakh plus population seek medical assistance, according to MP nursing home association advisor Dr Anoop Hajela. Around 90% of the 190 private hospitals are operational, he claimed.

“AIIMS Delhi has stopped routine OPD. Hospitals are open 24x7 and catering to all emergencies. We don’t want people to venture out, unless they have an emergency. People with minor ailments should stay indoors as hospitals can be a hotbed of infection,” said Dr Hajela.

The picture in colonies and residential areas is different. “Going to a clinic is not an option. Many of the doctors are not available. What if a minor infection becomes a major emergency,” said Ravi Verma, a resident of BHEL.

On the flipside, as fear and apprehensions increase, people have approached ‘operational’ hospitals for minor check-up of blood sugar and blood pressure. “People in need with such routine investigation should not come to the hospital,” said Dr Hajela.

He recommends calling 104 and other government-run helplines. However, there are no more than five doctors taking calls from across MP at one of the call-centres in Bhopal. As a measure of respite, Medical council of India has permitted doctors to prescribe over the phone.

Regarding financial help to elderly lawyers, who are members of the HCBA, Mishra said that due to their advanced age, they too require special attention as they needed medical aid more often than others.

Meanwhile, the Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh , the apex body of the lawyers of the state, has formed a committee consisting of its three members to help needy lawyers, who find difficult to cope with the situation, which has arisen due to closure of courts across the state.

The committee consists of Amrendra Nath Singh, former chairman of Bar Council of UP, present vice-chairman of Bar Council, Devendra Mishra Nagraha and member of council, Panchu Ram Maurya .

Vice-chairman of Bar Council of UP informed that this committee would try its best to help lawyers in this hour of crisis.

More than 200 more of them were found travelling in two containers at Pandharkawda in Yavatmal on Friday. On Thursday, about 350 were found in three containers bound for northern states that were intercepted by the police taking the total to nearly 600.Another 10,000 labourers from Chandrapur are stranded at Telangana border without food or water and not being allowed in as border is closed.According to Pandharkawda police, all these container trucks were heading to Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana and other places from where these poor labourers hail. It was only after the police intercepted trucks at Pandharkawda, suspecting them to be carrying cattle that the fact came to light. Though Telangana police denied any such migration, they are keeping tab on such container trucks.The nationwide lockdown from Tuesday to contain coronavirus spread has led to massive exodus of migrant labourers, particularly those hailing from the northern states, as their livelihood has been severely hit.The poor labourers were cramped inside the containers in inhuman conditions, making complete mockery of “social distancing” necessary to keep coronavirus at bay. They were seen sitting over each other in extremely cramped space with their baggage on them.Yavatmal cops asked the labourers to vacate the containers and sent the trucks back to Telangana on both days thus leaving no other option for them than to walk all the way their native states which are over 1000 km away.Local NGOs and police extended a hand to the poor migrants by offering them food and water after which they started walking to their respective destination, according to the locals. But not all headed home. Some of them stayed at the spot, while others went to Yavatmal by taking a lift in trucks headed that way.Some labourers told the police they hailed from villages in Jodhpur and didn’t have any other alternative than to somehow reach their native place. They said they don’t have resources to sustain after the lockdown and therefore, they wanted to be with their families in this crisis. Some of them have farms in their villages.Senior police inspector Ramkrishna Mahalle of Pandharkawda police station said twice containers were intercepted on Thursday. “The first lot of three containers with labourers in them was handed over to Telangana police. The labourers got off from the vehicles and walked back following the railway tracks and others along the roadside. They headed towards their respective states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana and so on,” he said.O Friday, the police intercepted two more trucks and penalized them for illegally transporting humans. “We handed over the vehicles to Telangana police and RTO. In this case too, the labourers started walking along highways to their destinations,” he said.Though senior police officials in Telangana said that they have no specific information about incidents of hundreds of migrants workers crossing the state borders in trucks during the period of lockdown, police sources confirmed that migrant workers from Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana working in cities like Visakhapatnam, Bengaluru and Hyderabad have been illegally travelling in trucks returning to their home states after delivering supplies in southern states.“More than 200 labourers and even drivers working in Visakhapatnam, Bengaluru and Hyderabad got into trucks that were returning to Rajasthan and Haryana from AP, Karnataka and Telangana. They reached Telangana-Maharashtra border and got down to have food. As it would be difficult to send them back, officials of both the states spoke to one another and allowed them to travel ahead in the same trucks,” said a police source of Adilabad.While Adilabad SP Vishnu Warrier said that no vehicles carrying men and women were allowed to cross the border, additional DG (law and order) Jitender said that there was some information about people hiding in trucks and crossing the state borders to reach their native places but upon verification nothing was found. “We are checking all the trucks now.

Sources in the forest department said that out of the 14 mandals in the Parvathipuram division, most share a very porous border with Koraput and Raigada districts in Odisha . Usually these routes are not monitored as they are not easy to reach. Many of these routes have been used for illegal across the border trade.

Due to Covid-19 scare, very few are slipping through the borders.

“Most of the border villagers are tribal. Many of their relatives live across the border in the districts of Odisha. Usually the locals use these paths to sidestep border norms,” said, G Lakshman Rao, DFO, Vizianagaram .

The forest department sources said the porous borders have always been used to sell banned commodities. “Now no one is willing to cross the border due to community quarantine by tribals living in these hamlets. The tribals have ensured that no outsider is allowed entry and no resident allowed to step out for too long,” said sources.

G Lachiah, a tribal and former president of Padmapuram village in Pachipenta mandal said: “We have decided to discourage people to leave the tribal villages. And people are taking no chances with Covid-19.”

LUCKNOW: As nationwide lockdown has left hundreds of stray animals to starve on the streets, the state government has decided to take help from SPCA (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) and NGOs to ensure food for them.

Stating that due to absence of food during lockdown, stray animals, especially dogs, may get aggressive or die, the government has directed the animal husbandry department to chart out a plan through which volunteers can provide food to animals.

Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has appointed principal secretary, animal husbandry, Bhuvnesh Kumar , as the nodal officer for the task.

His committee will also ensure adequate feed for cattle and fish, along with medicines and veterinary services during the lockdown period. Government said availability of food and medicines should also be ensured for cow protection centres, temporary/registered cow shelters, Kanji Houses and Kanha Upvans.

In an order issued on Thursday, veterinary services have been declared as essential service and government organisations, private clinics, veterinary pathologies and animal shelters will be allowed to operate. Production of animal food will be permitted and authorities have been asked to allow transport of such food, including hay, cattle feed, corn, soya, cattle and fish feed without any hindrance. Shops selling such products will also be categorised as essential service and allowed to operate. “District chief veterinary officers will be the nodal persons to ensure that such work is carried out without hindrance. Necessary passes should be issued to organisations producing and selling animal feed, and those transporting it, to markets,” principal secretary (animal husbandry) Bhuvnesh Kumar said.

It is attributed to non-functioning commercial establishments and the bulk consumers of electricity.

Trichy Urban division has about 1.6 lakh domestic connection and 40,000 commercial connections all falling within city limits. Besides, parts of the city are also covered by Trichy East and Srirangam divisions. With the majority of the city falling under Trichy urban division, per-day electricity demand of the city is estimated at 40 MW usually.

However, ever since the city came under lockdown from March 24, Tangedco said that there is a slight dip in electricity consumption. Same is the case of Trichy East division. Though the residential buildings have started consuming more electricity than the normal days, the surge in demand was compensated by the non-functioning commercial establishments including showrooms, multiplex theatres and malls in the city.

“As of now, there is no surge in electricity demand despite residents consume more electricity for operating air conditioners. Against the routine demand of 40 MW per day in Trichy urban, only 35-37 MW is being consumed,” an official with Tangedco Trichy said.

Meanwhile, residents in the past two days are apprehensive of unannounced power shutdown in parts of the city during afternoon and evening hours. Locals in Cantonment, Karumandapam, Mannarpuram and Thillai Nagar reported unannounced power shutdown ranging from a few minutes to 1 hour since Wednesday. Tangedco sources, however, said that the minor outages in residential localities have nothing to do with demand and supply factor. “The outages in the localities were due to the minor repair and maintenance work,” Tangedco officials clarified.

Electricity department officials said that uninterrupted power supply will be ensured as a section of people are working from home since the lockdown.

Maharashtra’s Chandrapur district administration and guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar has taken up the matter of the stranded labourers with Telangana government. They had come to Telangana to work on farms during chilli picking season and are now returning as work has stopped.

Wadettiwar called CM Uddhav Thackeray and urged him to intervene in the matter. Wadettiwar stated Thackeray spoke to Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao and urged him to ensure food and shelter for all Maharashtrain labourers to which the latter has agreed. Thackeray has also agreed to provide food and shelter to the labourers from Telangana stuck anywhere in Maharashtra, he said. Wadettiwar also asked Chandrapur's collector and SP to share the list of names, places to stranded labourers and their phone numbers with Telangana administration and arrange for their relief.

Though senior police officials said that they have no specific information about incidents of hundreds of migrants workers from Telangana crossing the state borders in trucks during the period of lockdown, police sources confirmed that migrant workers from Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana working in cities like Visakhapatnam, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, have been illegally travelling in trucks returning to their home states after delivering supplies in Southern states. ""More than 200 labourers and even drivers working in Visakhapatnam, Bengaluru and Hyderabad got into trucks that were returning to Rajasthan and Haryana from AP, Karnataka and Telangana. They reached Telangana-Maharashtra border and got down to have food. As it would be difficult to send them back, officials of both the states spoke to one another and allowed them to travel ahead in the same trucks,"" said a police source of Adilabad. While Adilabad SP Vishnua Warrier said that no vehicles carrying men and women was allowed to cross the border, Additional DG ( Law and Order) Jitender said that there was some information about people hiding in trucks and crossing the state borders to reach their native places but upon verification nothing was found. ""We are checking all the trucks now. People are not being allowed to travel in trucks,"" additional DG said.

Meanwhile, more than 200 labourers were found travelling in two containers in Yavatmal on Friday.

On Thursday, about 300 were found in three containers bound for northern states that were intercepted by the police taking the total to over 500. According to Pandharkawda police, all these containers were loaded on the trucks and heading to Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana and other places from where these poor labourers hail. It was only after the police intercepted trucks at Pandharkawda, suspecting them to be carrying cattle that the fact came to light. The Adilabad police, however, denied having any information about containers ferrying men. The nationwide lockdown from Tuesday to contain coronavirus spread has led to massive exodus of migrant labourers, particularly those hailing from the northern states, as their livelihood has been severely hit.

The labourers were cramped inside the containers in inhuman conditions, making complete mockery of “social distancing”. They were seen sitting over each other in the cramped space.

Mustard crops spread in large area of Gwalior, Chambal region are also affected adversely due to rainfall. Wheat and chana crops were ready for harvest when the yet another unseasonal spell of rain and hail struck the farms. The two crops are sown early in major part of the state, except in Chambal and Gwalior divisions.

Wheat and Chana in the Gwalior and Chambal region were still not ready for harvest like in other parts of the state, a farmer in Morena told TOI. These two crops are sown late in the region because of the dominance of mustard here, he added.

Beni Prasad, a farmer in Lakhapur village, said, “ I was about to harvest my crop when the rains started. It looks like I have suffered a huge loss”.

Harivallabh Patidar, an orange farmer of Agar Malwa said, “As the hail struck on the orange plants, the fruits fell down on the ground. Accompanying rainfall has also affected the crops badly.”

“Though the actual extent of damage is still unknown, it is believed that farmers in large part of the state in Bundelkhand, Vindhya Pradesh and Malwa region are most affected,” said one of the government sources requesting anonymity. The government may announce compensation to the farmers, but it is difficult to mobilize funds in the state where the annual budget is yet to be passed, added sources.

Covid-19 spread has already hit the economy and the Centre is also busy mobilizing funds for the relief and medical care, said government sources. Sources said the rainfall is likely to continue till March 30.

Singh, who has also donated Rs 15 lakh to the state’s war kitty, is totally focussed on whatever he could do for the people of his constituency in Allahabad.He is also helping the needy from other states. Recently, when Telengana CM K Chandrashekar Rao called him up for rescuing a number of migrant labourers of his state in Varanasi, he intervened to ensure their safe and timely return to their native place.Energy minister Srikant Sharma ensured a series of measures for officials and staff in his department, including timely payment of salary to 50,000 staff on contract, availability of sanitizers and masks to the linesman and interest rebate on online payment of electricity dues. “I have set up different teams in my Mathura assembly constituency to stay at Mathura-Haryana border, where hundreds of labourers are gathering everyday from adjoining states. We are taking them to their native places with the help of district administration,” Sharma told TOI.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has set up 11 relief committees to tackle the Covid-19 challenge. The committees have 20 IAS officers and 5 IPS officers, but no minister has been able to find a place.Meanwhile, Pathak has also written to the additional chief secretary, home, about “insufficient and incomplete measures by LMC in sanitising the city”.Quoting the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, the law minister said when the state was fighting against the pandemic, the primary duty was of the fire department, which is missing from action. “In other states, the fire department and fire tenders have been used extensively and deployed, while in Lucknow there is no deployment of fire department.

The clip went viral on social media after it was created on March 23, leading to a panic of sorts.

The three claim to have made the fake audio clip to scare their own children and family members, including the wife of one accused, who was not taking the corona outbreak seriously despite having just become a mother.

The culprits, speaking in convincing tones to each other, had referred to one Dr Kamlesh, who was on ventilator due to corona infection, and also discussed about Nagpur having around 200 suspect cases, which accentuated the fear in listeners. The speakers also referred to one ‘Nitin’, which sounded similar to a Vidarbha-based politician who is currently coordinating the fight against corona in the district.

Cyber cell, in collaboration with Sadar police station, managed to crack the case within 48 hours of filing a complaint against unidentified persons. The case is also the first where the source of a social media forward was traced, and the culprits brought to book. Joint CP Ravindra Kadam has announced Rs50,000 reward for the team that succeeded in doing this.

The persons arrested have been identified as Jay Gupta (37), Amit Pardhi (38), and Divyanshu Mishra (33), who were remanded to police custody for one day by the court later on Friday. Police had sought five days remand.

It’s learnt Gupta, a management graduate and working in the automobile industry, had teamed up with his friend Pardhi to create the audio clip. Pardhi, a mechanical engineer, had just left his job and was looking for another. It’s learnt Gupta had recorded the conversation and forwarded it to his friend Mishra.

Mishra, finance manager with a Delhi-based corporate company, later sent it to his wife, who has just delivered a baby. His wife sent it to a friend, and then the clip went viral. Gupta had later tried to destroy evidence by deleting the clip from the mobile phone of Mishra’s wife but the cops managed to pin the three down and even recovered the deleted data.

In view of the devastating effect of the clip, even the Press Information Bureau from New Delhi had issued a clarification. Even collector Ravindra Thakare and city civic chief Tukaram Mundhe too had to issue clarifications.

After the offence was registered, cybercrime team of APIs Vishal Mane, Keshav Wagh, and Ashwini Jagtap under DCP Shweta Khedkar and Addl CP Nilesh Bharne had started checking the forwards in the social media. They quizzed around 40 people before they were able to crack the case.

Sadar police team under PI Mahesh Bansode and others including head constable Vinod Tiwari also rounded up some people for questioning.

CP BK Upadhyay and Jt CP Kadam said there would be stringent action against the perpetrators.

151,['28/03/2020'],"Looking for a drink, M’rashtra, K’taka locals cross jungles to get into Goa","Keri: With a complete lockdown on all things alcoholic, people from the border villages of Maharashtra and Karnataka are desperate for a tipple.

Closed roads and highways mean there is no easy way into Goa for their usual urrack and feni. For the last three days villagers from Virdi, Talekhol, Aayi in Maharashtra have resorted to walking across the border into Goa through traditional jungle paths.

On Thursday, Valpoi police inspector Shivram Vaigankar received information that some people from neighbouring villages were to arrive in Shiroli. On investigation, police found villagers from Virdi and Talekhol had assembled at traditional liquor distillery units here. When it was revealed that they had come specially to drink urrak and feni, they were forced to disperse after police threatened to beat them with lathis.

Vaigankar told TOI, “We have taken serious note of those coming from Maharashtra. To control the movement of villagers from across the border, instructions have been given to police officials to take action against violators of the lockdown.”

In Surla of Sattari, a village on the border of Karnataka, liquor outlets have been closed for years now. However, there are some people who still sell alcohol on the down-low.

Khanapur police in Karnataka and the excise department on Thursday took stringent action against those who were attempting to carry liquor into Karnataka. Since, all the interstate roads have been blocked, buyers and sellers of alcohol are making use of old pathways and offbeat ghat roads to enter their destinations in Karnataka and Maharashtra.

152,['28/03/2020'],Celebrity chef Vishnu Manohar lines up lockdown menu,"The 21-day lockdown has naturally shaken up many with the biggest concern being running out of food. Many others are wondering how much they can innovate in kitchen with limited ingredients. Celebrity chef Vishnu Manohar says there’s no need to panic as the average kitchen shelf packs enough punch to take us through

Common belief is that 3-week lockdown needs heavy stocking up of food items

No, because all essential commodities shops are open so you can always go and buy things. But even if that’s not the case, regular items like wheat flour, oil, rice, daal etc will be more than enough for you to have a variety of items that will keep your appetite satiated for the next three weeks. There is no need to panic and hoard up on grocery items. According to my experience, for a family of five the amount of items needed for a 21-day period is very minimal. For the typical three meals a day , you only need 10.5kg of rice, 6.5 litres of oil, 8.5kg tur daal etc. So why buy 20 or 30 kg rice at one go?

The other concern is that limited items can be made during the period

That’s the biggest misconception. Variety of food does not mean using dozens of ingredients. Variety can be brought about by cooking the same food item in a different way. For example, we all have had sprouts at one time or the other. So the item is same, but you can cook it like a gravy item, or have it like a salad. In fact, I suggest people make it like a bhurji. Just sauté onion, tomatoes and green chilli in oil and add the sprouts with salt etc. Don’t add water and let it sizzle. I guarantee that you will forget egg and paneer bhurji . So the food item is the same, but the way you approach a dish makes all the difference.

Parents are worried about kids, who are usually fussy eaters

Here the trick is, which obviously is possible because of the lockdown, to get them engaged in cooking process. The other day we decided to have pasta in white sauce. Now to get the kids involved I said to them we will make the pasta at home rather than boil the packaged product. So we kneaded wheat flour dough, flattened it and then cut strips which were boiled. Get kids involved in the cooking process , according to their age, which will ensure they enjoy eating it too. The white sauce can be made so easily if you have butter, milk and flour. I later gave it an Indian twist by serving it with tempered daal, which is somewhat like Gujarati daal dhokli.

Most have potatoes or onions stocked up and will avoid going to vegetable markets

They don’t need to either. Use the stuff that’s already there. Potatoes are extremely versatile and so many dishes can be made using it. Similarly, for those missing non-vegetarian food, and avoiding to buy it in the current scenario, patodi rassa is something that can offer you a nice spicy kick. The good reliable soyabean wadi is also there as an accompaniment for a spicy gravy. So there is no need to panic, no need to hoard food. There’s enough of it available in shops and even the stuff in your kitchen and fridge will go a long way.

The sugar mill will prepare nearly 8,000 litres of sanitiser from its distillery and supply it directly to the government. Alcohol-based sanitisers are extremely effective in preventing the covid-19 spread.

Earlier, the state government had sought proposals from sugar mills and private distilleries for manufacturing sanitiser as its demand shot through the roof.

High production of sanitiser by sugar mills will also help check its price in the market.

Deputy executive director of the sugar mill Kuldeep Kumar told TOI, “After getting a nod from the government, we have started the production of ethanol-based sanitiser in accordance with the WHO (World Health Organisation) guidelines. We have been granted permission to manufacture 96,000 litres sanitiser, while the monthly output will be nearly 8,000 litres. We have raw material available with us and our unit will ensure that we produce high quality sanitiser for the public.”

“We have prepared 500 litres sanitiser on the first day of production and the cost of the production is nearly Rs 150 per litre. We have also informed the district administration that we are able to meet their requirement,” he added.

Local resident Harshit Jain told TOI, “It’s a really nice step forward by the government as there is a shortage of sanitiser and we are forced to use spirit (isopropyl alcohol) for sanitising our hands. I hope the sanitiser will be provided to the public at reasonable price through district administration soon.”

Vadodara: While the lockdown has brought out the good in police, the uniform is also tainted at times with shades of rudeness sometimes. Such an example was reported in Kapurai Crossroads on Friday, when 120-odd people from Surat were stopped from going to their hometown in Amreli district. Among the lot was a woman who was around 4-5 months pregnant and two small children.

“If you are pregnant, why are you travelling right now? Show me your medical certificates,” a cop on Vadodara border allegedly asked, stopping the diamond workers on the highway. Even after an entire day was spent convincing the cops that they were going to their own hometowns, they reportedly didn’t relent and made them sit in a bunch by the roadside for six long hours, flouting social distancing norm suggested by the government.

“I showed the cops medical papers of my wife Sangita but they argued that there was no need to travel as she wasn’t expecting soon. I work as diamond polisher in Surat and didn’t want to take any risk by staying back in Surat. So we were on our way to our hometown in Bhavnagar. Our vehicle was detained at about 11am and we were forced to sit by the roadside all day. They didn’t even care for the two kids travelling with us,” alleged Mohan Vadadariya.

Vadadariya told TOI that the cops then took their samples for Coronavirus tests.

Jayesh Bhataiya, a resident of Amreli who was also travelling with his family from Surat, alleged that they were not stopped anywhere within Surat, but no sooner they entered Vadodara, their vehicles were detained.

“Cops issued a memo to us and asked us to pay penalty at the regional transport office (RTO). But the RTO is closed due to lockdown. When we asked the cops how can we pay the penalty, they told us to pay when the RTO opens and then take our vehicles,” he said.

When asked why the cops made a pregnant woman wait by the roadside for hours, B H Rathod, PSI, Varnama police station said, “She was just four to five months pregnant. They shouldn’t have been on the road.”

“We detained about 20 vehicles that were moving on the highway amid the lockdown. Some of them were from Surat and Navsari while some were from Maharashtra. We allowed the people to go later,” he said, while defending the action.

When asked where they would stay, Rathod said that the mamlatdar will decide on that.

161,['28/03/2020'],"Bareilly admin sets up community kitchens, Shahjahanpur DM calls for urgent donations","Bareilly: Amidst nationwide lockdown due to Covid-19 outbreak, the administration in Bareilly has set up at least 10 community kitchens at different locations in the district to ensure the food reaches the needy, Bareilly district magistrate (DM) Nitish Kumar said on Friday, adding that a ‘0581-2457042’ helpline has been set up.

The DM of Shahjahanpur, meanwhile on Friday, has appealed to locals to support those who are facing difficulties and make urgent donations to support the needy. The residents have been urged to donate directly into the bank account of ‘District Magistrate Corona Relief Fund Shahjahanpur’.

In Bareilly, community kitchens are being set up in cooperation with some of the city’s wealthy residents and additional district magistrate (city) Mahendra Kumar is tasked with the coordination work. One can approach ADM on ‘9454417198’ for any query related to contribution towards community kitchens.

ADM Kumar told TOI, “With the help of certain NGOs and private individuals we have set up 10 kitchens with food to fill up at least 5,000 stomachs daily. Around 100 people have approached us till now for the cause. We are issuing vehicle pass to move to such organisations and individuals.”

The officer said that after talking to police, it was decided that the food for the needy will reach through the area’s station house officers as the beat constables would know the exact situation on the ground.

In Shahjahanpur, district administration has set up five kitchens with the help of local gurudwaras and local industrialist. Supply of food materials is being done through dial 112 police team. Around 1,500 poor families, mostly daily wage earners and beggars, were given ration bags containing rice, flour and other items to ensure that they don’t sleep without food. Similarly, SSP S Channapa and DM Indra Vikram Singh have set up a kitchen near NH-24 where hundreds of people returning from Delhi and Uttarakhand were fed by the police.

Additional district magistrate Ram Sevak Dwivedi told TOI, “We are concerned about the safety of everyone and the people passing through Shahjahanpur are also examined by medical staff to ensure they are not carrying any infection. If someone needs support, the person can contact police or dial the DM’s control room number. All the SHOs have been instructed to act immediately on the stress calls and coordinate with administrative officials in providing food or goods for ration for the needy. We have made a centre at Roza mart on NH24 where hundreds of people are offered food and they are also educated about maintaining social distancing.”

“People have approached us for support but we cannot allow them to come on roads and distribute goods to the needy. This is why we are accepting contributions through ‘District Magistrate Corona Relief Fund Shahjahanpur’ account,” he added.

HYDERABAD: Three more government labs began testing for the novel coronavirus in the last two days. Gandhi Hospital and Osmania Medical College in Hyderabad have already been conducting the tests. Apart from this, the Indian Council of Medical Research has authorised five private labs in Hyderabad to conduct Covid-19 tests.

Fever Hospital, NIMS and Institute of Preventive Medicine (IPM) began taking the samples and doing the coronavirus tests. In Fever Hospital, out of 20 samples tested, two came positive on Thursday and Friday. IPM test results are being sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, for further confirmation, Fever Hospital superintendent Dr K Shankar, who is also in-charge of IPM, said.

However, the private labs though having real-Time PCR equipment and imported testing kits have been asked to wait till the Telangana government issues separate orders.

Director of public health Dr G Srinivasva Rao told TOI, “We are going issue guidelines for coronavirus testing to private labs. As it is an infectious disease, we need to have surveillance and reporting. We have enough kits even if we get more samples.”

He said hospitals should collect nasal and throat swab samples of suspect cases and send them to labs.

Director of medical education Ramesh Reddy said MGM Hospital in Warangal will also soon start taking the samples and testing them. “The tests will be sent to NIV, Pune, and confirmed. ICMR is sending the testing kits,” he said.

He said the spike in the positive cases in Telangana has got nothing to do with increased testing but is related to more samples being collected.

Apollo Hospitals said it would start conducting the tests once the state government issues guidelines. Vijaya Diagnostics Centre, which was also allowed by the Centre to conduct he tests, said it would collect Rs 4,500 per test. The tests would be done only at its Somajiguda centre.

164,['28/03/2020'],"Block-level health teams to visit villages, towns to screen sick people","Bareilly: Block-level health teams will now visit villages and towns to screen people who have fallen sick upon returning home from cities after the lockdown.

According to health department officials, with scores of migrant workers returning to their villages, locals are calling them out of fear that the returning people might be carrying novel coronavirus with them to the villages. Officials said on receiving complaints, the block team would visit the village or town for the screening of the suspected person.

Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Vineet Shukla said, “We have been receiving complaints such as someone has returned from Delhi and is suffering from fever or a migrant worker has cold and cough. If workers are returning to their homes from metro cities like Delhi and Mumbai, it does not mean that they are suspected cases of Covid-19. But, as we have been receiving complaints from locals stating that their neighbour who has returned from the city is sick and might be a covid-19 positive patient, the block-level health team will visit the sick person and screen him. The team led by a medical officer will conduct check-up only if they will receive a complaint.”

If the patient is sick, they will give him medicines. “However, we will take the sample for testing novel coronavirus only if the person will show symptoms of covid-19. If any suspected case is found, the patient will be admitted to the isolation ward of the community health centre,” said the CMO.

For visiting the house of patients in rural areas, the block team can use ambulance or vehicles of Rashtriye Bal Swasth Karyakaram (RBSK). Officials said RBSK programme has been temporarily suspended due to the spread of novel coronavirus in the country.

Meanwhile, the health department on Friday conducted health check-up of 34 migrant workers coming from Delhi and Meerut. They were on their way home in Shahjahanpur and their bus from the Meerut depot took a halt at Satellite bus stand.

Sources said the health check-up was conducted on the directions of the chief minister’s office. A health team led by Dr Ajmer Singh and Dr Ranjikant screened all the 34 migrant workers and none of them was found to be sick. They, later, left for their native place.

Upon getting information, police rushed to the spot and sent the body for post-mortem examination. Meanwhile, the accused managed to flee the scene.

Police said one Vijay Pal had bought a piece of land from Rajendra of neighbouring village Pavsara and had started construction on the land.

On Friday, after Pal’s buffalo entered Rajendra’s field located adjacent to his land, Rajendra’s two sons started abusing Pal, said police.

Sensing the situation going out of control, Pal’s uncle Mahesh intervened into the matter and tried to pacify them. According to witnesses, as soon as Mahesh intervened, Rajendra’ family members started indiscriminate firing from the terrace of their house and two bullets struck Mahesh into his stomach.

Mahesh was rushed to the community health centre, where doctors proclaimed him dead upon arrival.

According to circle officer KK Saroj, following a complaint lodged by Mahesh’s son Avdesh, an FIR has been registered against Rajendra’s five sons, who are absconding.

“We are conducting raids to nab the accused. They will be arrested soon,” said the police officer.

166,['28/03/2020'],Experts lay trap in rubber factory to tranquilise elusive tigress,"Bareilly: To tranquilise the elusive tigress who has made a defunct rubber factory its home, the forest department has now placed a trap in one of its rooms where the big cat prefers to take rest.

Forest officials said that they have kept a goat as bait. They expect the trap’s automatic door to shut on its own when the tigress tries to enter the room. Once trapped in a “safe location”, it will be easier for experts to tranquilise the animal.

On Friday, divisional forest officer Bharat Lal explained, “After monitoring the movement of tigress within the rubber factory, we have placed a trap in the room where it visits more often. When the big cat is trapped here, an expert will fire a dart from ventilator or terrace to tranquilise the animal.” The abandoned factory has old tunnels, trenches and tanks, and so, it is difficult to tranquilise it here, he said.

Officials said a team of forest staff while combing the area saw the tigress resting near a plant within the factory on Thursday. Though the camera traps installed on the factory premises captured the images of the tigress a few times and forest staff found its pugmarks, it was the first time when someone had actually spotted it. The forest department had earlier placed three cages with bait to trap the tigress, but to no success.

Meanwhile, a team from Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), which was assisting forest department in the operation, has left Bareilly following the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak. However, officials said their operation is still underway and they have called additional forest staff from adjoining district.

The Synthetics and Chemicals Limited - known as the rubber factory here - spans across 1,200 acres and has remained shut since 1999. Over the years, it has turned into a mini-forest providing a safe haven for big cats due to easy availability of prey, plenty of water in large tanks, dense forest cover, soft grass and suitable places to hide.

A sub-adult tiger was tranquilised from the factory in 2018. Even a leopard spent two years here.

168,['28/03/2020'],Veggie prices rise on supply glitches but situation manageable,"Nagpur: The situation on commodities front remained manageable in the city even with bulk traders in vegetables and fruits absent at the agriculture produce marketing committee’s (APMC) yard in Kalamna. The vegetable traders will only begin working on Tuesday while fruit traders are off for full 21 days.

The neighbourhood fruit and vegetable vendors said they could manage getting supplies from semi-wholesalers at Santra Market and Cotton Market respectively. The traders here work for a limited period however.

The semi-wholesalers have been operating for 2-3 hours in the morning till 9 am. With Kalamna now shutting down, uncertainty has increased. Other essential commodities too were available though there were some hitches in procuring fresh stocks especially for fast moving consumer goods.

Dealers in medicine too were apprehensive about not being able to get fresh stocks due to restrictions on transport. The matter has been taken up with the police commissioner. The supplies of grain and milk continued without disruption.

There was an increase of Rs 10 to 25 per kg in the rates of common vegetables. Vendors TOI spoke to said potatoes that were sold at Rs 25 to 30 a kg when things were normal are now being sold at Rs 40. Onions have touched Rs 35 to 40 kg fom Rs 30 to 35. Tomatoes that were Rs 15 to 20 a kg are now upto Rs 30, they said.

Mohamed Vakil, a vendor at Amravati Road, said, “ we could manage till now. Let’s see if there is enough stock at Cotton Market even tomorrow, because Kalamana is closed till Tuesday.”

Next to him, a fruit vendor Seema Naik said fruits like bananas and grapes were still available in enough quantity. If not abundant supply there is no shortage also.

The complaint among the grocers was that none of the FMCG distributors were sending stocks. There was a dearth of branded disinfectants like Dettol too. Anusuya Majgaonkar of Anusuya Kirana near Ravi Nagar said, “we have enough grains but none of the companies’ distributors are replenishing stocks. Finally, I got a call from a detergent maker. Hope he delivers fast.”

Virendra Thakkar of Logists Park Pvt Ltd said, “some permissions are being granted, many applications are being turned down.” Logistics Park is the sole distribution centre of pharmaceutical companies like Lupin, Cadila, Mylan, Shreya Pharma. FMCG companies include ITC, Reckitt Benckiser, Marico among others.

He said there was a shortage of disinfectants like Dettol and Savlon because stocks were lying at the godowns. The transportation from the godowns has now begun but fresh stock needs to come from manufacturing centres too. Else, the supplies may not last beyond 10 days or so.

Hetal Thakker, president of Nagpur Chemists and Druggists Association, said traders had taken up the issue of bottlenecks in transportation with the commissioner of police and the problem will be resolved.

A group of cooking gas delivery men said these days they were delivering the cylinder at the doorstep instead of taking it inside the homes to avoid contact.

While the students ventured out to purchase essential commodities during the lockdown put in place to tackle the spread of Covid-19, they faced racial discrimination from few locals.

Sources said that a group of 15 students hailing from various parts of Arunachal Pradesh, studying in the Art and Science College in Trichy, were staying in a rented apartment near their college. Following the nation-wide lockdown, the attempts made by these students to buy food products failed as they were being racially discriminated by a section of people here.

Official sources said that the students were being criticized for their appearance. Subsequently, the students contacted the helpline of Arunachal Pradesh government. Officials with the government of the northeast state alerted the officials of district administration in Trichy.

Sources said that Srirangam sub-collector Sibi Adhithya, who was apprised about the incident, insisted that these students should not step out of their apartment. The district administration then with the help of the revenue department employees purchased and delivered the essential commodities to the students. As the Arunachal Pradesh government came to know of this effort taken by the district administration, Khandu took to twitter to thank and appreciate Adithya’s efforts in helping the students in need.

The civic body said that the separate waste collection mechanism was initiated on Friday as a precautionary move and to allay fears among neighbours.

The urban local body has allotted at least two vehicles in each of the four zones here for the exclusive door-to-door waste collection from around 2,000 quarantined houses in the city as on Friday. Each zone will be allotted up to four sanitary workers.

The sanitary workers and vehicles will be disinfected before and after collection of waste. “Though it is not proven that novel coronavirus may spread through waste, we do not want to take any chances. Since nearby residents are apprehensive over common waste collection practice, we initiated the separate waste collection process,” an official with the corporation said.

Unlike the routine waste collection, the civic body said that the waste collected from the houses under isolation will be incinerated at the micro compost centres. “People under home-quarantine are extremely cooperative to the exclusive waste collection process,” a sanitary official with Trichy Corporation added.

Sanitary workers collecting waste from quarantine homes have been provided with face masks and hand gloves. The workers are periodically disinfected, the official added.

172,['28/03/2020'],Excise dept wary of bootlegging,"Jaipur: For tipplers, nothing could be more tormenting than the ongoing lockdown. They are ready to pay anything a black marketer demands. But there are not many at the moment to meet the demand.

A senior official in the excise department said such situations are a perfect foil for a black market to thrive, but the travel restrictions and sealed borders have plugged all such possibilities.

But he said that it is a peculiar social issue that led Kerala and Punjab to keep liquor in the essential items list. In Punjab, the shops were shut down after curfew was clamped down. Kerala too flowed suit. But in Haryana, shops were open till Wednesday and closed after opposition criticism and on fears of collecting crowds.

But there is a fear of bootlegging taking place which is a main reason for hooch tragedies witnessed in the past. A senior official in the excise department said they are keeping a watch.

“The demand for liquor cannot be eliminated as some people are used to it. In such situations, there is real chance for bootlegging. We are alert to this possibility,” said the official.

Abstinence is a long process. In the absence of liquor, the regulars develop behavioral problems and they need to be counselled which is not possible under the current circumstances, said the official. On Friday, a man in Kerala committed suicide for not finding his daily kick. That was one of the reasons the southern state had allowed outlets to open before the countrywide lockdown was imposed.

The state had also planned to facilitate home delivery of liquor. But move was subsequently scotched in view of the practical problems.

For many states, liquor is a major revenue churner. Rajasthan gets around 8,000 crore annually from liquor. It has already received the application money of Rs 860 crore for retail liquor shops.

The fund-strapped government was banking on excise department for meeting its revenue shortfall. It had made several new changes to its liquor policy for 2020-21 to increase the income, including giving permission to all types of hotels and restaurants for selling liquor.

But the lockdown will seriously impact the revenue targets it had set earlier.

174,['28/03/2020'],Social workers in Rampur go online to feed the needy,"Rampur: Social workers and volunteers in Rampur are increasingly using social networking sites to distribute food and the other edible items to the poor during the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown. The homeless, e-rickshaw drivers, daily wagers are the worst hit as the city has come to a standstill.

Making use of the social networking sites, people are uploading photographs of the poor on their Facebook and WhatsApp pages with their addresses and asking social workers to help them. Some of the needy are also posting photographs with their addresses requesting help.

On Friday morning, photograph of a handwritten open letter of a girl whose ailing father who pulls rickshaw for a living went viral on social networking sites. He is currently suffering from paralysis. The family has appealed for help as they are left without food during the lockdown. She had also mentioned her address in her letter.

Fawad Khan, president of a local NGO, said, “After reading the letter of the girl on my Facebook wall, we immediately reached out to the girl and her father. We provided them with 20kg of food ration.”

“The girl’s family said that the only bread-earning member - 55-year-old Firasat Khan - is suffering from paralysis and they had not eaten food for the past day,” Khan said, adding, “We are maintaining a social distance while distributing the food packages to the needy.”

According to him, some volunteers have distributed around 500 ration packages of 10 kg each consisting of wheat, rice, sugar, tea and pulses.

175,['28/03/2020'],University of Hyderabad researcher develops vaccine candidate,"HYDERABAD: Hyderabad has joined the scientific race to find a vaccine for novel coronavirus. A researcher from University of Hyderabad (UoH) has already developed a “vaccine candidate”, crossing the first hurdle in developing a new vaccine that could help prevent the spread of Covid-19. With coronavirus likely to emerge season after season like SARS and MERS viruses, a vaccine could help contain the rogue germ.Dr Seema Mishra of department of biochemistry, School of Life Sciences, UoH, designed the potential vaccine candidates, which will help in development of actual vaccine. She identified the vaccine candidates as ‘T cell epitopes’. They will help in understanding all structural and non-structural proteins of Covid-19 for experimental testing. “Right now, best defence to prevent further Covid-19 infections is social distancing. Vaccination will take some more time due to the need for further work on these candidate epitopes. We are hopeful that our computational findings will provide a cost-and time-effective framework for rapid experimental trials towards an effective Covid-19 vaccine,” she said.Like other viruses, novel coronavirus is a protein molecule with a lipid of fat covering or coat. But, it has its own genetic make-up that makes it different from other viruses.Dr Seema disseminated her finding to scientific community worldwide through chemistry research and blueprint platform called ‘ChemRXiV’. She said laboratory studies (in vitro) are needed for conclusive evidence. “These vaccine candidates are small coronaviral peptides, molecules which are used by cells to trigger immune response to destroy cells harbouring these viral peptides. Using powerful immune-informatics approaches with computational software, I designed these potential epitopes (part of antigen recognised by immune system) in a way that can be used to vaccinate entire population,” she said.A UoH statement said vaccine discovery usually takes 15 years, but powerful computational tools helped in enlisting these vaccine candidates in 10 days. A ranked list of potential candidate vaccines, based on how effectively they will be used by human cells to stop the virus , is generated by Dr Seema. “With no matches present in human protein pool, these coronaviral epitopes pose no cross-reactivity to human cells and hence, immune response will be against viral proteins and not human proteins,” the statement said, adding that these results will have to be investigated experimentally to provide conclusive evidence.This research is first such study on Covid-19 vaccine design from India.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74861395,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-156399,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-joins-the-world-race-to-find-vaccine/articleshow/74854971.cms
176,['28/03/2020'],Here residents share cleaning and waste disposal tasks,"Thiruvananthapuram: The lockdown of the city might have helped to break the chain of Covid-19 transmission. But, it has also broken the ‘chain of daily life’ in city’s apartments. Residents, who had been served by helpers, security personnel and home nurses in apartments, have started to feel the pinch of the lockdown.A quick, random check at city’s apartment complexes revealed that majority of the residents have risen to the new challenge. “We have around 70 apartments with 60% occupancy. We used to employ three cleaning workers. These days only one person can reach for work. The residents happily divide the rest of the work among themselves. They have taken up cleaning of the lobby and common area on a daily basis,” said Anand Thomas, secretary of Kowdiar Manor owners’ association.Daily waste disposal is among the major issues faced by the residents post the lockdown. “We have an incinerator with which we burn the paper and sanitary waste. We have contracted a corporation authorized agency to collect the food waste, but they haven’t turned up for the last five days. We are planning to use incinerator as a temporary arrangement to burn wet waste. Plastic waste is collected and handed over at corporation collection points. We can keep that here till the crisis is over,” added Anand.G T Raveendran, secretary, Samrudhi Thampurans Owners’ Association, Thampuranmukku, said that the residents have divided the cleaning work among themselves as the two housekeeping staff can’t reach for work due to police checking.“There are 40 apartments here. The lobby area and floor are cleaned by apartment owners on rotation. It is not much difficult to maintain the area as we all work collectively. We have a waste converter to process organic waste. It was earlier managed by the cleaning staff, now the residents bring the waste down, drop that in the machine and one of us operates it. It will take 24 hours to convert it to manure,” said Raveendran.The association also arranged bulk purchase of groceries, milk and vegetables for residents. “We have tied up for direct supply of milk, vegetables and grocery to all flats. Consumerfed mobile shop supplied grocery to us on Thursday,” said Raveendran.Praveen Manikantan, a resident of SFS Cyberpalm, Akkulam, said the residents there had sent the food waste to a nearby farm as cleaning workers were absent.Environmentalist Shibu K N said that it is the duty of each citizen to minimize the garbage generated in this hour of crisis. “Try to make new recipes by using the leftover vegetables, which we normally put in the bin. Also, try to use the vegetable waste as compost for plants. Even in a flat, this is possible as vegetable waste can be used as organic fertilizer for flowering plants on the balcony,” he said. Shibu also urges city residents to try to boost the confidence of cleaning workers. “They are scared too with a lot of news on disease all around. Try to segregate and wrap materials like used masks and gloves. Speak to them empathetically. Encourage them to wash hands in between their work,” he said.",thiruvananthapuram,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/here-residents-share-cleaning-and-waste-disposal-tasks/articleshow/74853238.cms

The roads have been blocked by villagers in the area, say residents.

Abhishek Asthana, who lives at Indus Crest Apartment, said, “The Osman Nagar village road has been blocked using branches. While we understand that villagers want to protect themselves during this time, it could hamper emergency cases.”

The apartment complex is in Osman Nagar, a village that is part of the Tellapur municipality. The road that has been blocked connects locals to Lingampally and Nallagandla.

Asthana said that there are road blocks on both sides of the road. “Pregnant women, elderly and those who are ailing are finding it difficult to enter the city,” he added.

Amit Bharti, another local, said, “The day after the lockdown was announced, villagers blocked the road. There was no space to take a car out and only a bike can pass. Since my flat mates cannot ride a bike, only I have to go out to get supplies which is tedious.”

Srinivas A, who lives at an apartment complex down the same road, said, “My mother is a senior citizen. Getting medicines for her has become a problem. If she needs medical attention, I fear we will be in a tough position.”

LUCKNOW/KOLLAM: IAS officer Anupam Mishra, who violated home-quarantine instructions after his return to Kerala from Singapore and left for his native place in UP’s Kanpur district, was suspended from service pending a departmental inquiry.

Health officials in UP’s Kanpur and Sultanpur districts had been looking for Mishra, a Kerala cadre officer who had been booked by the Kerala government for not adhering to the mandatory quarantine prescribed to al travellers, and finally tracked him down to his grandfather’s house in Sultanpur, UP. Violating the quarantine, Mishra, who belongs to Kanpur’s Swaroop Nagar Colony, had returned to his home from Kerala four days ago.

When health officials in Kanpur reached his residence, they learned that he had moved to his grandfather’s place in Sultanpur on March 23 to participate in a puja.

Sultanpur CMO CBN Tripathi, who tracked down Mishra, said: “He and six members of his family have been isolated in their home.”

According to an official statement by Kollam district magistrate Abdul Nasser, “Newly-wed Anupam Mishra and his wife returned from Singapore on March 19 and were advised home-quarantine for two weeks. Instead of staying at his official residence, he left for Bengaluru with his wife the same day. Now we know that he has gone back to his hometown in UP.”

Nasser told TOI that though Mishra did not show any symptoms, the protocol says every traveller should be quarantined. “The point is that he left without informing anyone,” he said.

Sources said Mishra and his wife could be quarantined in Kanpur and their contacts would also be traced. “The officer went to Bengaluru and met his relatives. He then took a flight, which means that people in the flight are also to be tracked and tested. Besides, his family members in Kanpur will be screened for infection,” an official involved in surveillance said.

The bureaucrat fraternity, at least in Kerela, is not happy about the way Mishra behaved, saying it was irresponsible and the government should act tough.

A senior police officer in Kerala said, “Kerala is among the worst-hit states in India. It also has a high number of people with travel histories. If someone from the government takes orders lightly, the general public is bound to follow. Action must follow to establish that no one is above the law.”

TOI tried to contact Mishra but he was not available for comment.

180,['28/03/2020'],"Residents oblige, most stay indoors","Madurai: The third day of the lockdown on Friday witnessed lesser crowds on the roads in Madurai, compared to the first two days, and traffic movement was almost nil in many parts of the city. The city police booked three people for violating the rules on Friday.

In some places like South Veli street and near the Meenakshi temple, people came out to the streets in the morning, but were warned by the police against venturing out. Earlier in the day, the Central vegetable market opened at around 3am. President of the Madurai Mattuthavani Vegetable Market Association, P S Murugan said they had asked only retailers to come and purchase in bulk to ensure that they sold more during the limited time given to them by the government. “We didn’t want individuals to be harassed in the market, so we discouraged them from coming to the market,” he said.

Many shops which were listed by the corporation to supply groceries to people after they made bookings over the phone, were seen operating with their shutters down. The manager of one of the shops said they were taking orders over phone and the workers were asked to pack them for delivery. “If people come to the shops this would lead to crowding again,” said Kumar, a shopkeeper.

The corporation also added seven more shops taking the number of shops authorised to deliver goods to the people in the city to 26, covering all parts of the city. Smaller neighbourhood grocery stores that did not figure in the list, too opened early and shut down by 12 noon. “Vegetables were selling at a higher price. Shallots sold at Rs 100 per kg and onions at Rs 50 per kg in the wholesale market. Since we would find it difficult to sell them in the local areas, I bought very little vegetables for Rs 1,000 as a precautionary measure,” said Pandi who runs a store in KK Nagar.

Meanwhile, the Madurai district superintendent of police N Manivannan said that four cases were registered against people who had violated Section 144 promulgation on Thursday. The Kalllikudi police registered a case against nine people as they had organised a cricket tournament at T Valayankulam village in the district. The Thirumangalam Taluk police registered a case against two men for gathering people to discuss about the arrangements to be made for the consecration ceremony of a temple at Thirali village. They also registered a case against one person for roaming near the Vagaikulam junction without any valid reason. The Melavalavu police registered a case against two for hoisting the SDPI party flag at A Vellalapatti village.

Madurai city police registered seven cases against people for opening tea shops, petty shops, bakery for violating the order on Thursday. Similarly, 11 cases were registered against those roaming in the city without any valid reasons. Cases have been registered against two people for selling liquor in the city. In Tirunelveli, the city police registered 12 cases against 19 violators and the district police registered 40 cases against 64 violators so far. About 120 cases were registered against 142 violators in Tenkasi district.

The court, however, made it clear that dealers will be allowed to sell only 10 per cent of their existing BS-IV stocks and those vehicles will not be sold in Delhi.The bench conducted the proceedings through video conferencing with lawyers presenting their case from their office through video calls. Though the apex court had earlier refused to extend the March 31 deadline and rejected dealers’ plea for more time, it agreed to grant them relief now in the wake of the lockdown.FADA had pleaded the court for more time to sell the stock of BS-IV vehicles—around seven lakh two-wheelers, 12,000 commercial vehicles and 15,000 passenger cars. The apex court had in October 2018 ruled that not only manufacturing but sale of BS-IV vehicles will not be allowed after cleaner BS-VI fuel norm comes into force from April 1, 2020 to curb pollution.FADA contended that the inventory of BS-IV vehicles had piled up with dealers as they were not being purchased due to economic slowdown and pleaded that they be allowed to sell till April-end.

With only 350 people tested in Uttarakhand till March 27, the experts say that more testing is required to get the accurate picture, considering that there has been an influx of foreign travellers in the Himalayan state in the first week of March for yoga events as well as a large number of people returning to their villages from cities like Delhi and Mumbai, where there is a significant outbreak of Covid-19, and no mechanism deployed to test them.Dr Sunil Sanon, Mussoorie-based physician who provides voluntary medical services in the villages of Garwhal, told TOI, “Ghar Wapsi (Homecoming) of the men of the hills working outside the state may cost dear to the health authorities who are neglecting this large influx of people returning to their homes after the lockdown. Many of them returned to their homes as early as in the first week of March and managed to reach the hills unchecked. I have written to both health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan and PM Modi highlighting this issue.”Another senior doctor from AIIMS Rishikesh who didn’t wish to be named, added that it is important that the government does more testing in order to arrive at conclusive figures. “At present, only people who have a history of travelling abroad and those who came in contact with identified Covid-19-positive patients are being tested. The government needs to test more, considering that the three forest service trainees and the man who was found positive in Kotdwar were not showing many symptoms when they were diagnosed as Covid-19-positive.”",dehradun,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/is-ukhand-still-in-stage-i-of-pandemic/articleshow/74854243.cms

DEHRADUN: A 24-year-old woman from Haridwar died of swine flu on Friday. This is the third death of H1N1 in Uttarakhand this year. Haridwar chief medical officer ( CMO ) Dr Saroj Naithani confirmed that the death had been caused by swine flu.

“According to the family of the patient, she was admitted at a private hospital in Dehradun for a week, from where she was referred to a higher centre on Thursday,” she added.

That health department on Friday sought to collect samples of the family of the woman, but they refused. The family has been kept in home quarantine, as Covid 19 symptoms are similar to those of swine flu.

Talking about preventive measures aginst the communicable infection, the CMO said that people must cover their nose as H1N1 spreads through droplets.

“Swine flu is a form of influenza, which is curable but the virus can prove to be fatal in case of diabetics, children and the elderly. Hence, I advise early treatment and avoiding contact with people who show symptoms of the flu. One should immediately consult a doctor in case of consistent fever and breathlessness,” she added.

Of these, around 50% workers are present at the work site on any given day due to COVID-19 scare, said an official. As the centre has refused to sanction an amount of Rs 301 crore to the state for payment without work, the state government could not stop MGNREGA work.

While chief minister Ashok Ghelot had earlier said that MGNREGA workers need not come to the work site till March 31 and they would be paid their wages during the lockdown period, the department had urged the chief minister’s office (CMO) to bring out a fresh direction stating that the decision violated the provisions of the Act. It is not permitted to pay wages to the workers without coming to the work site under the Act.

“About 10 lakh families have demanded for works under the scheme in the state. The demand is very less due to the ongoing crisis. Now, those who have demanded work, we cannot refuse them. These workers are given individual tasks to ensure social distancing. We may also reduce the size of the groups. Around 50% workers are absent on any any given day due to the fear of spread of the virus,” said state MGNREGA commissioner P C Kishan.

These workers are engaged in individual as well as community works under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), Apna Khet Apna Kaam, cattle shed works etc.

“Also, there was a rush in demand for work in March because families wanted to complete 100-day quota of work for current fiscal. If they don’t complete 100 days of work this year, the remaining days will not be carried forward,” he added.

The even semester was on the verge of getting over when institutions were closed as a preventive step to contain the spread of Covid-19. Since students are confined to home during the lockdown, teachers are using the opportunity to engage with them to complete the portion.

Virtual classes are effective than asking students to self-study through e-content. The students can also clear their doubts at the end of the session, said the head of Biotechnology and Microbiology department M S Mohamed Jaabir.

The biotechnology department of National College Trichy (NCT) has been effectively using ‘Google handout meet’ mobile application to conduct online classes.

“Some departments have completed their portions and are focusing on their practical exams. But biotechnology comparatively has large portion and this software has been effective in bringing students together to cover the remaining portion,” he said.

Students only have to find a space in their home to attend the classes. It was easy to take classes through the software to share the presentation apart from discussing and answering their questions, added Jaabir.

“We should have completed the portions in a matter of seven or eight more days when colleges had to be closed,” said K Valavan, principal, Saranathan College of Engineering.

They were told that the academic days lost will be compensated with rescheduling of working days. It is vital to complete one or two remaining chapters to go ahead with practical examinations, he said.

“We are sending e-content to students and looking into the possibility of conducting the third internal assessment online. But we will have to see how sincerely students are taking it,” he said.

There are many softwares to conduct online classes, he added.

Haridwar-based Bakshi, who is in touch with her son over phone said that mess service is closed in the hostel and food is bring brought from outside. “I do not know what will happen if the situation worsens further. I have pleaded to Indian authorities to urgently do something,” she said.

She added that several parents, mostly based in Delhi and Mumbai, are exploring options to book a charter flight to bring the children back from Mauritius. “However, the civic aviation ministry has not responded yet,” she said.

Echoing similar fears, Abdul Ahad, whose son is studying in the UK said, “The university has told students to stay indoors and online classes for their course are going one. But there is no clarity how the students will return home.”

The domino effect of the three-day-old lockdown continued to tell on the goods supply chain across states on Friday, with government intervention failing to resolve operational complexities like 60% of the 1.2 crore trucks stuck on highways and cities being held up because they are laden with “non-essential” FMCG cargo.

In Rajasthan, the state government has issued directions to all collectors to ensure regular supply of food items to people during the lockdown period. Food and civil supplies secretary Siddharth Mahajan said shops selling groceries, essential commodities and medicines can remain open 24x7 in the state. But persons coming to grocery stores cannot come in vehicles.

“People can go to grocery stores on foot or on bicycles,” the secretary said, adding door-to-door and online deliveries should be encouraged so that people need not go to the market for their daily needs during this period.

Apart from working in the kitchen, maids do the dishes, mop floors, and clean toilets at the household which increases threat of contamination for them during this alarming situation. TOI spoke to a few housewives and maids to get a closer look at the situation.

Kavita Borkar, a cook is still going to homes for cooking. She says maids have now become more aware of hygiene and properly clean themselves before entering kitchen. “I have not taken any leave as of now, don’t know about the coming situation. I make sure to properly clean my hands and feet before cooking food,” she says.

These maids were very keen towards taking off on the day of Janata Curfew , “We didn’t do any work this particular day. But staying at home every day is not feasible for us,” Kavita says.

Another maid who didn’t want named, says, “I have got paid leave as I asked for it. I have received my part of payment as I wanted to stay at home during such time. Also I am thankful to the people where I work for understanding my situation,” she says.

Housewives and working women are a bit worried about maids directly enter the kitchen or coming for cleaning hence some have decided to give them a long holiday until the situation is in control, “I have give my maids full paid holiday way before. I am taking all necessary steps about hygiene. Why invite the diseases by being careless. I think everyone should give leave to their house help, its beneficial for both the parties,” said Madhvi Kavishwar , a professor.

Aarti Bawariya, who has small children at home, works days and nights to earn that extra penny. She was doubtful about taking long leave. She was also worried about leaving her children at home during this time. “We have to go out and work, but I am always worried about my children. Did they wash their hands? I am sure I won’t get paid leave, but I am going to take leave at the earliest,” she says.

According Suman Patle,a maid, staying at home and not working is not workable for her. “Even if I want to, I cannot afford to take leave. I know a few who have taken leave. But I cannot afford it,” she says.

215,['28/03/2020'],"Uttar Pradesh: Beni Prasad Verma, doyen of social justice movement, passes away at 79","Beni Prasad Verma

LUCKNOW: Veteran socialist leader Beni Prasad Verma passed away on Friday leaving behind a void in the Samajwadi Party, which he and his friend and mentor Mulayam Singh Yadav had founded in November 1992 to challenge the might of the Congress and the BJP.

Verma passed away after prolonged illness on Friday evening. He was admitted to a private hospital in Lucknow where he breathed his last. He was 79.

Hailing from a family of farmers in Barabanki, Verma’s rise from a humble background marked the assertion of backward sections in politics through socialist ideology and heralding of the anti-Congress movement.

Having started his career as a small-time employee in a sugar mill, ‘Beni Babu’ (as Verma was popularly known), joined the activities of sugarcane union and contested his first election in 1974.

Beni never looked back since then and make strides from Barabanki to Lucknow and finally to Delhi where he served as a Union minister twice, as telecom minister in the Deve Gowda government and as minister for steel in the Manmohan Singh government.

The Mulayam-Beni combination represented the rise of Yadavs and Kurmis, as was also seen in Bihar with Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar, and Vakkalingas-Lingayats in Karnataka, during the same era.

These forces of social justice finally formed the SVD (Samyunka Vidhayak Dal) governments in different states heralding anti-Congressism.

Chief minister Yogi Adityanath led the political fraternity in offering condolence to the veteran socialist leader. UP assembly Speaker Hridaya Narayan Dixit said, “Those were the days when politicians did not have much money. Mulayam and Beni often used to take rickshaw to Aminabad market in Lucknow or go to watch films.”

In Mulayam-led government in UP, Verma used to be the second-in-command and held key portfolios like PWD and parliamentary affairs. He once claimed that his idea of ‘cycle’ appealed to Mulayam so much that he officially announced it as the symbol of Samajwadi Party.

Verma was the one who challenged the alleged corporatisation and glamourisation of the party by Amar Singh. Before 2007 assemble elections, Verma parted ways with Mulayam to form his own outfit, Samajwadi Janata Party. He merged his outfit with the Congress in 2009.

The Beni-Mulayam split also weakened the social justice movement.

It was due to Beni’s political acumen and understanding of the pulse of the masses that Congress president Sonia Gandhi included him in the Congress Working Committee and elevated him as Union steel minister after the Congress won 10 out of 21 seats in 2009 in Oudh and Terai belts, where Kurmis unitedly voted for the party.

Later, Beni parted way from the Congress and returned to SP in 2016. He was currently a sitting member in Rajya Sabha.

Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav, also expressed deep sorrow over his demise and said he played a key role in the party’s formation.

Police is keeping 24-hour watch on the borders. Though there are 262 people in quarantine in the district, residents fear that if any infected person from Bhilwara enters the city and comes in contact with others, then there can be a major outbreak in the city too.

So far, Ajmer has not reported any case of coronavirus. Over 50 patients were tested, but negative. SP Kunwar Rashtradeep said the borders adjoining Bhilwara have been totally sealed and police is checking every vehicle moving close to the border.

Ajmer is just 60km away from Bhilwara city. “Both roads from Bhilwara are completely blocked and no one is allowed to enter the district,” said an official. Even the adjoining Kekri border is sealed. But there are villages like Nagelao, Kadera and Kairut from where people can enter into the city. District chief medical and health officer K K Soni said there are 262 people in Ajmer city who are quarantined, including people from Bhilwara. However, there might be over 600 such people.

“The major problem is that no one informs about such people coming from Bhilwara and that is a lapse in security measures,” said Soni. He added that they are appealing everyone that they should inform about such people so that the health department can quarantine them in their houses for the next 15 days. The health department initiated a survey and also deputed teachers to check that people who are quarantined don’t leave their houses. Ajmer police is on heels and checking every unnecessary movement on road.

The signboard says the road has been temporarily closed and that people from outside, other districts and states are not welcome. The police will be informed and action taken if people forcefully enter the village, it stated, adding that this dictate would last as long as Sec 144 of the CrPC is in force in the state.Ramalingam, a villager, said that many people who pass through their road stop by their village asking for small help or even water. ``We have been seeing so much information on how this deadly disease is spreading through outsiders. Hence we have decided to block our road for our own safety,’’ he said.They have also decided not to go out of their village till the curfew is lifted and are creating awareness among their villages on the importance of handwashing.Similarly, a signboard asking outsiders to stay away has been put up outside the refugee camp at Subramaniapuram in Tirunelveli.

The excavation works were being carried out by 55 volunteers and workers, and five archaeologists from the state archaeology department. While work was yet to begin in Manalur, at Keeladi, Agaram and Konthagai trenches had been dug up, some up to a depth of three feet. The sixth phase was extended to the villages following demands to make the excavation and research activities more extensive.

Last week, the authorities prevented the public from viewing the ongoing work at Keeladi, following a request by the Keeladi panchayat president as a precautionary measure. As many of the workers work closely in some of the trenches which had been dug for more than three feet, it was decided to stop the excavation works till further notice.

On Thursday, the workers and archaeologists covered the pits that had been dug up with tarpaulin to prevent sand and water from entering it.

Archaeology department sources said that it was disheartening that they had to put the work on hold at this stage when they were making important discoveries including a skeleton inside a burial urn in Konthagai.

BHOPAL: Amid lockdown to contain spread of coronavirus, Congress and the ruling BJP have started a blame game accusing the other for the plight of farmers . With by-polls to 24 seats to be held in the next six months, both the parties want to be seen on the right side of the farmers’ in the state that is predominantly agrarian dominated.

A day ago, former chief minister Kamal Nath had written a letter to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan demanding special attention towards the farmers. The BJP in reply hit out at Nath alleging delay in farm loan waiver has affected the farmers. Former BJP minister, Narottam Mishra said that Nath kept himself under isolation for 15 months and now is taking up farmers’ problems.

""It's now after 15-months that Kamal Nath is concerned about the farmers. During his entire tenure, he remained on the fifth floor of the Mantralaya, in isolation. Also, the Congress government, that came to power on the promise of farm loan waiver, failed to keep its words,"" said Mishra.

Former CM, Nath in a letter on Thursday appealed to chief minister Chouhan to extend monthly relief of at least Rs 7,500 to each farmer for the next two months, in view of the imposed lockdown to contain the COVID-19 threat.Mentioning that the Rabi harvest and sale had already begun, Nath wrote, “Several crops like wheat, peas, coriander , mustard and gram are ready to be harvested. But, due to the lockdown harvesting is not possible and there is a chance of crop damage.”

He demanded an interim relief for farmers for the next two months, so that they could make up for their losses to some degree. Taking a jibe at the concern shown by the former chief minister, Mishra said, ""Congress government didn't do anything and now, they are shedding crocodile tears over farmers’ plight."" He said chief minister Chouhan has already announced relief for the farmers and procurement of Rabi crops.

Housekeeping and toilet cleaners at the government offices and buildings have been asked to work in shifts. Sachin Tadwadkar , who’s deployed in a government office, works in three different shifts. His job includes cleaning, disinfecting doors, windows, toilets tables and working spaces of employees.

“I reach the office at around 8.30 in the morning, and leave after two hours. The second shift starts around noon and ends after two hours. The third shift is in the night. There should be no compromise in cleanliness and we are told to keep everything clean,” he said.

What about leaves? “We cannot take long leaves, as somebody is always required in the office to clean and sanitize. Since we can go home in between shifts, there is a relief,” he said.

Talking about the safety equipment given to sanitation workers, NMC health officer Pradeep Dassarwar said that besides gloves, jackets are also provided to them. “They work in 6am-2pm shift and they are following all the protocols cautiously,” he said.

TOI also spoke to a few in the housekeeping staff at the airport. They wished not to be named but spoke about the continuous working hours and cleanliness routine. They don’t hope of getting any leave as of now. “We also want to protect ourselves from the virus. Unless the airports are shut, we cannot expect off-day,” said a female housekeeping staff.

“We wear masks, sanitize ourselves and start our routine, which includes cleaning the railings, windows, door knobs and almost everything,” a male housekeeping staff said.

Devidas Wadhai, who supervises the housekeeping and cleaning work at a government organization, said, “We do our duty religiously, all the workers works in multiple shifts but now we make sure to put on a mask, gloves before cleaning. Coronavirus is dangerous, but it’s our duty.”

Adding to this, Praveen Tekam, another sanitation worker, said, “We are keeping ourselves safe by following all the precautions. We are provided with disinfectants, sanitizers, masks and gloves while working,” he said.

232,['28/03/2020'],Collector warns of stern action as violations rise,"Trichy: Stung by the callous attitude of the people in venturing out to the streets unmindful of the disaster in waiting in the form of Covid-19, a livid Trichy collector S Sivarasu warned the violators of severe action here on Friday.

“Rampant violation of the curfew happens every day in both city and rural. We are out here to protect you. If you stay indoors, your life will be safe,” said the collector expressing serious concern about the congregation of 40 to 50 people in public places not paying heed to the advice and appeal of the government.

He also asked the police to act tough against the violators in the days to come. “I warned several times. If two people are found riding on two-wheeler, they will be booked and vehicle will be seized. They cannot take back their vehicle. Those out for medical purpose and to buy essential things will be allowed, that too only after scrutiny,” said the collector.

Quoting the survival of fittest theory of Charles Darwin, collector Sivarasu advised the people to adopt the change and safeguard their lives.

On the third day of the curfew, vehicles were seen on the roads everywhere. While some had valid reasons, several got an earful from the police for loitering.

On Friday, Trichy city police arrested 123 people in 42 cases and seized 75 vehicles besides collecting a fine of Rs 26,310 by evening.

The situation was same in Trichy rural, Ariyalur Perambalur, Karur, Pudukottai, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagappattinam. As at 5 pm on Friday, 319 people have been arrested and 131 vehicles seized in 254 cases in the central zone. From March 25, a total of 2,011 people were arrested and 1,006 vehicles were seized.

234,['28/03/2020'],Mangaluru: Pandemic hits wedding industry hard,"MANGALURU: The wedding business is facing an uncertain future due to the Covid-19 crisis . For the time being, most weddings that were to be held in April , have been postponed indefinitely. Caterers , event management firms, photographers , halls, musical ensembles, hotels and other related businesses are busy attending to calls, and refunding advance payments made by their clients.Sudhakar Kamath of Kamath Caterers said, “Most weddings that were scheduled for April have been postponed. It is a difficult phase for the industry that is currently engaged in repaying the advances taken from clients. So far, we have received cancellations till April 26, and people are closely watching the situation,” he said.On the other hand, people are considering organising functions with smaller gatherings, once the lockdown ends. “Instead of calling 1,000 people, they may settle for 100. All functions have been cancelled up to April 14. Almost all halls and convention centres were booked during this period for functions, including birthday parties, baby showers, engagements and other functions. Even the Uttarkriya function, observed on the 11th day, following the death of a person, is restricted to homes,” said Kamath.For those who have postponed weddings, finding the required venue could also be a challenge, as people have made advance bookings till February 2021. December bookings are full. One of the options left for those who have postponed weddings is to conduct the wedding in a temple, and the reception could be held as per availability of the venue, because muhurats are not seen for the reception. In Mangaluru, the trend is to conduct the wedding and reception on the same day.Bhojraj Kalladka, manager, Sanghaniketan Convention Hall,said, “We have been receiving calls, and people have been sending letters to the office, seeking postponement of weddings. We have refunded a few people and the rest will be refunded after the lockdown is lifted and our office reopens. We had about 14 weddings booked in April, of which seven have been cancelled so far,” he said.With the cancellations of weddings on the rise, the commercial photography industry has been hit hard. Shridhar N Shettigar, president, South Kanara Photographers Association, consisting of 3,224 professional photographers from Dakshina Kannada and Udupi, said, “April-May is considered as the peak season, and it is unfortunate that weddings are postponed in this period. Since it is important to keep pace with the latest technology, many photographers have invested several lakhs of rupees on mirrorless cameras and other equipment, recently,” he said.“On an average, a photographer gets up to 10-15 orders during the peak season, in the entire year, and mostly relies on this season for earning. Everyone was happy that there was no moudya (days when weddings are not conducted as per the Hindu calendar), but with the Covid-19 pandemic, the industry has come to a standstill,” he added.The industry’s expectations were high this year. When compared to the previous two years, this year had no moudya for April and May, which meant more functions would be held.",mangaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74856945,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-135796,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/pandemic-hits-wedding-industry-hard/articleshow/74854320.cms

Visakhapatnam: As borders come up around the world to contain the spread of Covid-19, those stranded in foreign lands are looking for ways to return home.

A family of three from the city that visited Sri Lanka on tourist visas has now been stranded in the country for over two weeks. Chaitanya Bandaru, his wife and son have been staying at a hotel in Wadduwa ever since their holiday was suspended on March 15. Since there were restrictions on international travel, Chaitanya initially shifted their date of return to India to March 22 from 24.

He then extended his stay till March 29 as all flights on March 22 were suspended, stating, “Because of shutdown announced by states till March 31, my flight on March 29 too got cancelled. I had later booked flight on April 1 to Hyderabad for approximately one lakh Sri Lankan rupees. But, because of total lockdown for 21 days, the flight on April 1 has been cancelled.”

Chaitanya continued, “Now, I had to book tickets for April 17 on Sri Lankan Airlines at a cost of 1.86 lakh Sri Lankan rupees. Because of this extended stay for additional 24 days, I have to shell out $2200 approximately for accommodation and food for my family. This is causing a lot of financial strain as my trip duration tripled from 11 days to 34 days,” adding that he had written a letter to the Indian embassy in Sri Lanka to help him travel back.

In its reply, the Indian embassy said, “It is to inform you that as per latest guidelines, no scheduled international commercial passenger aircraft is allowed to land in India from March 22 for one week. You are advised to continue staying back at your current location until situation improves. You will be informed as the commercial flights resume its operations.”

249,['28/03/2020'],Jodhpur cops feed needy,"Jodhpur: Police have emerged a good samaritan for the starving destitute scattered around the city in various settlements .

Contrary to its ‘anti-human’ image, police in Jodhpur have been consistently reaching out to this distraught lot, mostly daily wager and labour class due to loss of their jobs because of the lockdown and providing them with what the need the most during this testing time — food.

Right from maintaining law and order arising out of the lockdown to pleading to citizens to remain indoors to distributing sanitisers to keeping an eye on the influx of migrants ensuring that they are screened, police have been playing a pivotal role in ensuring compliance of the orders and directions of the administration and the government. Various thana police in city have identified settlements in their respective jurisdiction where people have been finding it difficult to get ends meet and have distributed food packets either on their own or with the help of donors or charitable entities.

A senior police officer said they have to play multiple roles in any calamity or crisis. “As police remain in the field 24/7, it is our duty to ensure compliance as well as to attend to deprived ones,” said the officer.

On Friday, Mandore police distributed food packets among the settlements of Pak Hindu migrants under the police station area.

These persons, mostly daily wagers, have been finding it tough to sustain during the lockdown.

Hindu Singh Sodha, president of Seemant Lok Sangthan , appreciated police for their service. Even Government Railway Police and the Railway Police Force have arranged food for the needy.

250,['28/03/2020'],"2,000 garment workers in Mumbai plan to trek 1,400km to UP homes","Employers’ body provides food to workers but provisions are running out

MUMBAI: The Covid-19 pandemic has spawned a humanitarian crisis in the narrow bylanes of Wadala. Deprived of income to meet their living expenses in Mumbai, around 2,000 workers employed in small-scale textile units here plan to trek 1,400km back to their homes in Uttar Pradesh.

These men are employed in the small-scale textile units in National Market—among India’s oldest readymade garments markets—along Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Marg. Their units shut almost 20 days ago, since Covid-19 cases began to be reported.

Their employers promised them meals if they continued to pay the rent for their kholis —tiny rooms shared by around 10 workers. After almost three weeks of providing them two meals daily, now the employers’ association has said it won’t be able to keep up the charity any longer.

The textile workers, who earn Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 a month, want to return home and plan to walk to Uttar Pradesh as they are worried about the plight of their old parents, wives and young children there.

Rafiq Shaikh is one of the workers preparing to leave for Kanpur where his parents are. “I have just Rs 5,000 left in my bank and don’t want it to get depleted further by staying on here,” he said. Shaikh’s parents have been asking him leave Mumbai.

“Trains and buses are not functioning. If no group or people come forward to help soon, I am going to start walking,” he added. His roommate said, “It is better to die in our villages than due to starvation and coronavirus.’’

The employers’ association, comprising 300 wholesale dealers of garments, had put up a makeshift structure in the marketplace 10 days ago to serve as a kitchen for the workers. National Market president Yasin Shaikh said the association has no means to continue feeding them for months. “The lockdown has handicapped us. Our groceries’ stock and money are depleting,” he said. Moreover, it is a challenge to buy provisions in bulk during the ongoing lockdown. “To feed 2,000 workers, we need huge quantities that can best be brought from the APMC market in Vashi, but how do we go without policemen beating us,” he said.

Since several workers stay in one room where they eat and sleep, “even if one of them gets infected, the infection will spread easily,” said Shaikh. The association wants the government to organize a special train or bus to send the workers to UP.

Social worker Imran Khan said locals donate rice and dal for the stranded workers. “The fear right now is starvation more than coronavirus. Even if these men start walking, it will take them a week or more to reach home. Given their poor nutritional status, they could contract the virus along the way,” said Khan.

Congress corporator Sunil More, who visited the slums adjoining the market, said, “I have spoken to a local gurudwara as well as a few builders to continue providing meals for these stranded workers from Uttar Pradesh.” He also has given a contract to a private contractor to fumigate the workshops and houses.

But men like Rafiq Shaikh don’t want to stay on. In times of Covid-19, they would rather be home than thousands of kilometres apart from their families.

Surat: It seems lockdown order and social distancing to combat COVID-19 have gone for a toss in the city. Apart from movement of vehicles in most parts of the city, residents were seen thronging grocery shops and vegetable markets, discarding the appeal for social distancing made by Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) and district administration on Friday.

Residents had thronged the grocery shops, milk counters and medical stores on the entire stretch from Ramnagar to Adajan. People were standing in queues outside the shops without keeping a safe distance. The scene was horrific at Sardar Market at Sahara Darwaja, where large number of people had come to purchase farm fresh vegetables and fruits, without worrying about spread of contagious COVID-19. They had gathered in large numbers at one place rubbing shoulders with each other.

Rajesh Kaladiya, a vegetable wholesaler at Sardar Market, said, “We had closed the gates of the market in the morning and asked customers to enter in small groups. But when the gates were opened, a sea of people entered the market. We couldn’t do much to stop them.”

Kaladiya added, “The market is regularly getting supply of vegetables, but still people are coming to the market to buy vegetables at wholesale rates. Majority of customers are from residential apartments.”

Nilesh Thorat, secretary of Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), which manages Sardar Market, said, “We immediately asked senior officers of municipal corporation and district collector’s office to visit Sardar Market. A team of officials visited the market and ensured deployment of cops to stop people from gathering at the market from Saturday.”

Dr Ashish Naik, deputy municipal commissioner (health and hospital), told TOI, “Residents need to understand the seriousness of COVID-19. They have to maintain social distancing when standing at grocery shops, vegetable markets etc.”

The decision was taken after the department received requests from residents and meal service providers that due to the lockdown in the city, they were unable to get food delivered to their homes.

Arvind Narsikar, district supply officer, told TOI that many people are suffering due to the services being disrupted in the city amid lockdown.

“We have decided that the service providers can continue with their work while taking necessary precautions,” he added.

According to Narsikar, there are many senior citizens and patients who cannot cook food and require ready-made food.

“Those who cannot cook on their own, as they are old or sick, depend on the delivery services for their meals. We have permitted the service providers to supply food to such people. Also there are many students who could not go to their native place. In addition, the servicemen who live alone and working from whom have to arrange for food from outside,” he said.

Narsikar said that the department has directed the meal service providers not to pack food in plastic bags.

Sanket Joshi, who runs such service, said “We could not provide food for three days and received several enquiries during that period. Those who cannot get up from their bed to cook food are dependent on our service. The district supply department has asked us that if we have to deliver food to anyone who is in quarantine, we should stay careful.”

MADURAI: Only 60-70% of the pharmacies, with measures in place to maintain social distancing, in Madurai district are currently functioning as opening of all pharmacies is not mandatory in view of lockdown. Meanwhile, sugar factories have started getting license to produce hand sanitizers, which is set to bring down prices and ensure enough supply for public.

“It is up to the owners of medical shops whether to open or not. We try to insist on enough shops to be opened to ensure medicines reach public accordingly in different areas,” said an official from the Tamil Nadu drugs control department (TNDCD).

“Some of the smaller pharmacies are afraid to open considering the COVID-19 scare as they don’t have many preventive measures in place. There is definitely no shortage of medicines. However, it could be that some brands are not available because of the current issues in movement of goods we are facing due to lockdown,” said pharmacist from KK Nagar. While medicines are available in plenty to cater to public needs, masks continue to remain in high demand but short supply. Pharmacists and TNDCD said that though there is a shortage of hand sanitizers now, it would soon be sorted. “Licenses are being given now to sugar factories to enable them to produce sanitizers using ethanol. Few factories have already started production. Soon, we will have enough supply to meet the public demand. This would also bring down prices,” said a medical representative.

The TNDCD, meanwhile, continues to monitor and conduct inspections in pharmacies to ensure no illegal practices are taking place. Any person with complaints regarding non-availability of medicines, overpriced medicines and substandard or overpriced masks and hand sanitizers can contact the department officials.

On Friday, the RBI said it would conduct LTROs aggregating an additional Rs 1 lakh crore, which fund industry executives say will help stabilise bond prices for some more time.Due to the coronavirus pandemic, there have been large sell-offs in the equity, bond and forex markets in the country. “With the intensification of redemption pressures, liquidity premia on instruments such as corporate bonds , commercial papers and debentures have surged. Combined with the thinning of trading activity with the Covid-19 outbreak, financial conditions for these instruments, which are used, inter alia, to access working capital in the face of the slowdown in bank credit, have also tightened,” the RBI said.To mitigate their adverse effects on economic activity, the RBI, through LTROs of three-year tenure, will infuse up to Rs 1 lakh crore into the system, it said.According to Nimesh Shah , managing director & CEO, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, LTROs worth Rs 1 lakh are aimed at soothing the bond market, which over the last one month had witnessed a spike in yields. “This measure will aid in enhancing liquidity in corporate bond markets and consequently lead to easing in short term bond yields of high rated corporate bond papers,” Shah said.Since the beginning of the month, as the pandemic-led selling intensified in the stock and bond markets, mutual fund industry had been asking RBI to provide a line of credit to meet higher redemption requests, just like the central bank did during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74859408,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-51368,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ltros-to-ease-mfs-debt-pain/articleshow/74855568.cms

For, this arid district has about 4,000 to 5,000 of its residents stationed in Italy.It's difficult to miss the Italian imprint in the three tehsils of Mandawa , Nawalgarh, and Jhunjhunu. The interiors and design of houses are a testimony to the local diaspora flourishing in Italy.But the times have changed. With a pandemic striking the world this soldier town's fears are now well beyond its borders.Adding to their woes are worries that a major concentration of people from Jhunjhunu stay in areas worst-hit by the novel coronavirus like Lombardy region (Milan, Brescia and Bergamo) and Campania region (Naples and Marmo So Napoli).Engaged mainly in the hospitality, agriculture and manufacturing sectors, it is mostly the Khateeks, listed under the Scheduled Caste community, who have ventured into Italy. But if for so many years they were marked by their branded clothes, watches, bags, shoes, now it is fear of being stigmatized that haunt these men.Rohit Nehra (35) is spending time in isolation at the Rani Sati Mandir guesthouse ever since he came into contact with a Covid-19 positive couple who had returned from Italy. “Thirty years of our hard work has fallen like a pack of cards. My elder brother completed his isolation last week after coming from Italy. The pandemic has shaken us up to the core as we lie quarantined here with an uncertain future,"" he says.Explains Shravan Panwar (71) the passion of the Khateek community for Italy, ""When the Middle East opened its doors for Indian workforce it was a time for us to break the caste and economic barrier. Unfortunately, all unskilled and semi-skilled jobs were preferred to Muslims while highly skilled to the upper caste Hindus. Here again, we were left unattended due to our caste. During the same period, we heard stories from Punjab as how lower caste people were heading for Europe for menial jobs. Initially, some courageous members of our community took the risk via ships but soon it opened a passage for the rest, "" says Panwar, who has retired from his work in Italy and is now living in Chidawa with his grandchildren. He was among the first wave of migrants in the late 80s.Back in Italy, the residents are reluctant to return due to fear of losing jobs and for avoiding the ordeal of travel from Italy to Delhi to Jhunjhunu to be followed by quarantine period at home. Poonam Chand (58) who works as a cook in a restaurant in Bolzano City, North Italy , has been in a lockdown since March 11. ""I have told my family to be the last Indian to leave Italy as it is our Karam Bhoomi (workplace). This is what has given us an identity and a better life, "" said Chand over the phone.Sharing how life was in a state facing the worst face of Coronavirus, he said, ""Until March 11, we were not aware of the scale of the problem. It is only after the lockdown was announced that we focused on how Italy is in the middle of it's biggest crises, "" said Chand.But not everyone is like Chand who do not want to return.

Health minister Dr C Vijaya Baskar confirmed the case by re-tweeting the National Health Mission’s tweet in this regard.

Said to be an employee of a famous mall at Velachery, the woman, a mother of two, developed symptoms of fever and cough on March 19. She travelled to her native Ariyalur by train from Chennai and stayed at the house of her mother. However, she got admitted to the government hospital the next day.

The doctors sent her swab and blood samples to the viral research and diagnostic laboratory (VRDL) at the government medical college hospital in Tiruvarur which confirmed the infection. Sources said her health condition was stable.

Since the mall where she worked witnessed big crowds, the public health officials have alerted their counterparts in Chennai to trace all those who contacted her during her work. Public health officials led by Dr V C Hemachand Gandhi identified the people who were in contact with the woman in Ariyalur. As she met her parents and relatives on her return, the officials put 14 people including them on home quarantine.

Sources said she was married to a man in a village near Meensurutti in Ariyalur district. While her husband and children were residing in the village, the woman was staying in Chennai for the past two months.

“We have informed Chennai Corporation for cross reference. They are tracing all her contact persons as per protocol. Since she travelled from Chennai by train, we have passed on the information too,” Ariyalur collector D Rathna told TOI.

The officials were perplexed by the contradictory information given by the woman about her work and stay in Chennai. An official said she claimed to be staying at Saidapet. “She was working in the mall but we have no idea in which shop and where she resides. Since the woman is not revealing the exact details to the health team, we have asked the police to enquire with her,” said the collector.

As of today, four patients including three women are kept under observation at the isolation ward at the government hospital in Ariyalur. She is the second infected person under treatment in a hospital in central Tamil Nadu after a 24-year-old Dubai returnee in Trichy.

The RMO said that the youth fled even before they could collect swab samples to ascertain whether he is suffering from coronavirus. He said they have entered the details after he approached the doctors with symptoms and asked him to stay in the isolation ward for check-up.

The youth fled from the hospital along with the case sheet to avoid investigation. Inspector Rajasekhara Reddy said that they have booked a case against the youth.

GGH superintendent Dr S Babulal said no one should be worried as the government is taking care of their health once admitted to the hospital. He said that getting admitted to the isolation wards would not only help the patient but also his family members and society.

PUNE: Additional sessions judge SM Agarkar on Friday granted interim pre-arrest bail till April 15 to directors of Sujata Farms Private Limited Jayant Ramchandra Mhalgi (63) and his wife, Sujata (58), in the alleged Rs96.99 lakh cheating case related to a plot scheme at Girivan hill station project floated by the firm at Dongargaon and Hotale village, about 40km from the city.

Judge Agarkar referred to the Covid-19 outbreak and said in his order, “Looking towards this extreme situation, granting of interim relief is the need of the hour. Due to present situation, the hearing of bail matter can be adjourned till April 15.”

The judge said, “The allegation in the FIR does not disclose need of immediate custodial interrogation . Imposing reasonable condition ensuring cooperation of applicants (the Mhalgis) in investigation will meet the ends of justice and so far will not hamper the investigation. The investigating officer (IO) on query by the court submits that attendance of applicants is sufficient for investigation at this juncture. Moreover, the IO can apply for urgent hearing in between in case of extreme urgent situation.”

Earlier, the Paud police submitted a report opposing anticipatory bail for the two applicants. The lawyer for the original complainant too objected to the bail plea, contending that the affected investors have been struggling for last 19 years to secure justice in the matter. Lawyers Suchit Mundada and Swapnil Jagtap, representing the Mhalgis, argued that custodial interrogation of their clients was not needed considering that the dispute was of civil nature.

The court directed the interim protection on the two applicants furnishing personal release bonds of Rs15,000 each and sureties in the like amount. Among other conditions, it directed the Mhalgis to report to the police for interrogation as and when required and not to leave India without the court’s permission.

261,['28/03/2020'],Covid-19: Plan to send samples to Thiruvananthapuram irks healthcare providers,"KOCHI: Healthcare providers in Ernakulam district are upset with the state government’s decision to send samples of those suspected to have Covid-19 in the district to a lab in Thiruvananthapuram.Now, the samples from the district are send to National Institute of Virology (NIV), Alappuzha, for testing and the results arrive in 2 to 3 days. On Friday, 24 samples were send to NIV, Alappuzha.Health officials fear that sending the samples to Thiruvananthapuram, which is almost 200 km away, means that more time will be lost and there would be further delay in announcing results if there is a surge in numbers due to community outbreak.The matter was discussed by the Ernakulam district medical officer (DMO) and doctors in the district Covid-19 team with the district collector and he was requested to take up the matter with the state government.“We are still sending the samples to NIV, Alappuzha. We are concerned that there may be a delay if we send it to Thiruvananthapuram. We have taken up the matter with the collector. For us, the closest testing lab is NIV, Alappuzha,” said district medical officer (DMO) Dr M K Kuttappan.As per the guidelines for distribution of laboratories issued by health secretary on March 25, it has been instructed that district surveillance officer from Ernakulam will have to send samples to Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Thiruvananthapuram. The lab will also receive samples from Kollam district. Meanwhile, NIV Alappuzha will henceforth cater to testing samples from Alappuzha and Malappuram districts, as per the government guidelines.NIV, Alappuzha, was one of the first testing labs in the country that was permitted to confirm Covid-19 positive samples without sending them to NIV, Pune. Due to increase in the number of people who needed to be tested for Covid-19, Kerala received permission from Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to set up two more labs. Now the state has nine labs, all in the public sector, with four in the state capital alone. No lab in Ernakulam district has yet received permission for Covid-19 testing yet.ICMR has updated the protocol for coronavirus and now the criteria have been expanded to include health workers attending to Covid-19 patients who start showing symptoms. Earlier it was limited to symptomatic people with a travel history to affected countries or those who come into contact with infected persons.Incidentally, as the number of people in quarantine increases, there is excess burden on the approved testing labs with a government official admitting that often the waiting time for test results now is 3 to 4 days. Health officials said that what they need at the moment is not more private labs but more testing kits at reasonable price to be made available to the states.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74853496,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-104991,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/plan-to-send-samples-to-tvm-irks-healthcare-providers/articleshow/74853497.cms

Around 50,000 coaching students who are stuck in hostels, PGs are being provided with food by various organisations.

Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla has sent ration material for nearly 500 families for 10 days for distribution among the needy in Bundi. His OSD Rajiv Dutta on Thursday handed over the ration material to Bundi district administration and asked to arrange distribution of the same among those in need of food material during lockdown.

Besides, the 2003 bath Rajasthan police officer Dutta along with his team of volunteers moved to Bheel Basti in Banganga area of Bundi district and distributed round 750 food packets among the locals who are mostly daily wagers and finding it hard to meet both ends meet in absence of work during lockdown. Food material among the needy during lock down would continue to be distributed by teams of volunteers in Kota and Bundi, Rajiv Dutta said and added the teams of volunteers maintaining social distancing are moving in the localities and distributing the food packets.

The distribution of food packets aims at ensuring that daily labourers, people living on roadsides, destitute may not stay without food during lock down, he said. Meanwhile, police teams are also engaged in distribution of food packets in localities of daily labourers and workers and are moving door-to-door. Kota city SP Gaurav Yadav has asked locals to report for donation of food and ration at emergency phone number 100 so that cops can collect it to distribute among the needy.

263,['28/03/2020'],Assault on public: Action against cops after inquiry,"Vijayawada: Even as videos of police beating people on roads and other public places during the lockdown went viral, the police department is yet to initiate action against the officials for their excesses.

Sources in Director General of Police (DGP) office said that inquiries have been ordered in all the incidents and action will be taken only after receiving the reports.

In the Dachepalli incident that took place at the border of AP and Telangana on Thursday night, the cops booked cases against those who pelted stones at the cops. As the police stopped people from entering into AP unless they agree to go on quarantine, clashes broke out between the cops and the people headed to their native places in AP from Telangana.

While the people pelted stones at the cops after heated arguments, the cops unleashed force by caning them. The videos of the police beating people including women went viral on social media platforms.

The cops said a DSP rank officer and five other cops on duty were injured in the stone pelting and lathicharge was done to control the situation.

In the Peravali incident, where a sub-inspector was seen beating up a man who returned from abroad, the home minister had announced his suspension but, the higher officials have reconsidered the decision after taking the cop’s version into consideration.

Sources in the DGP’s office said the SI had been working for the last four days and the man returned from abroad ignored repeated requests by the cops to stay in home isolation. He took the extreme measure only to keep him in isolation as a last resort, said the sources.

Even in other incidents reported at Hanuman Junction, Kurnool and other places across the state, the department has backed its officials. Sources in the DGP office said that the police took the extreme action only after running out of all options.

On the other hand, Piduguralla CI was placed under vacant reserve for dereliction of duties as he was not properly monitoring the people placed under home quarantine.

UDUPI: An acute shortage of masks has arisen in the district following the announcement of the lockdown . Due to the fear of contracting coronavirus, all those who are stepping out of homes to buy essential commodities are wearing masks. As a result, demand for masks has shot up, and most of the medical shops in the district have run out of stock.

Udupi deputy commissioner G Jagadeesha has asked people not to resort to panic buying of masks. “A healthy man need not wear a mask. Only people undergoing treatment and doctors need to wear N95 masks. If people are going near someone who has fever and cough, they need to wear a triple-layer mask. This is what the guideline says,” he said.

KV Nagaraj, assistant drug regulator, Udupi, said, “N-95 masks are used by those at high risk like Covid-19 patients, doctors and medical staff. Triple-layer masks can be used by health staff in the hospital’s outpatient department and patients with cold and cough. There is no need to buy washable masks from medicals stores, because they can be made at home with cotton and rinsed with hot water.”

Chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy directed the officials to constitute the taskforce with five ministers, 10 senior IAS officers and four senior officials from the CMO.

Ministers Alla Nani (health), Buggana Rajendranath Reddy (finance), Botcha Satyanarayana (municipal administration), Mekathoti Sucharitha (home) and Kurasala Kannababu (agriculture) will be part of the taskforce.

The cabinet chaired by the chief minister met here in the secretariat on Friday and discussed the measures initiated by the government to contain the spread of the coronavirus in detail. Interestingly, the seating of the ministers and senior officials in the cabinet meeting hall was arranged in such a way that it maintained the social distance of two metres.

Giving details of the cabinet discussions to the media, information and public relations minister Perni Venkataramaiah (Nani) said that the chief minister directed the officials to strengthen the medical infrastructure and fully gear up the administration to tackle the crisis.

He said that the government has kept a close vigil on all the 28,000 foreign returnees in the state. “The state has so far reported 12 Covid-19 positive cases. All are undergoing treatment. All the suspects have been moved to quarantine homes,” said Nani.

He said that four hospitals--one each at Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, Tirupati and Nellore--have already been converted into dedicated super specialty hospitals to battle Covid-19. He said that 100-bed isolation centres are in place at constituency-level and 200-bed isolation centres at district-level.

He said about 400 ventilators have been kept ready with PPEs (Personal Protection Equipment) such as Hazmath suits for the medical professionals. He said that they have also procured over 10 lakh surgical masks for patient attendants along with over 52,000 N-95 masks. He said that they have placed orders for more equipment which is likely to be reached in a couple of days.

The minister expressed serious displeasure with the students and software engineers trying to rush back to their native places. “It is very sad to see that students and others from our state are stranded at other places but the situation prompts us to say no to their entry. They are all educated and they should understand the situation better,” said Nani.

He, however, said that the government is ready to allow people into the state if they were willing to go to quarantine homes instead of their own homes. He advised students and techies to stay back in the places of their work and study till the completion of the lockdown period.

The minister said that the chief minister has directed the collectors to immediately convert all function halls into shelter homes to provide food to the homeless and orphans. The cabinet appealed to philanthropists to come forward to feed the homeless during the hour of crisis.

PANAJI: Chaos ensued in the state on Friday as desperate citizens threw social distancing norms to the winds and thronged provision stores in large numbers to stock up on basic food supplies, a day after chief minister Pramod Sawant announced that grocery shops would be opened following ‘public demand’.

People thronged the streets from as early as 6am to scout for essential goods like rice, milk, pulses, flour, oil and vegetables and mobbed grocers and other vendors, maintaining virtually no distance from each other.

In some places, police tried to enforce distance between customers, while in other places, the regulations were hardly there.

With no clarity on the availability of groceries and the promised home-delivery of goods not forthcoming in most areas, citizens indulged in panic-buying as many of them had exhausted their essential provisions, with the shops having been closed for several days now.

“I do not want to go into the crowded shop, but I ran out of rice two days ago, and atta yesterday and I don’t have a fridge to store cooked food. If the shops close again tomorrow, what will we eat? Yesterday we only ate boiled potatoes,” said Uma Yadav, who works as a domestic help in Taleigao.

In Panaji, mayor Uday Madkaikar on Thursday night announced that the municipal market would remain closed.

Some departmental stores which were open tried to enforce social distancing guidelines, by marking one metre notches so as to maintain space between people waiting in queue. However, in many places people crowded the shops in a scramble to buy food before stocks were wiped out, and police had to act against some persons in Bicholim, Valpoi and in the outskirts of Mapusa. Authorities were forced to close down the Valpoi market after people began crowding it on Friday.

While the Mapusa municipal council and several panchayats have started door delivery of essential groceries, the chairperson of the Valpoi municipal council has promised to follow suit and ensure all residents receive basic supplies.

Meanwhile, support for a petition demanding a total shutdown to prevent crowding in grocery and vegetable shops continues to grow, after three people in the state tested positive for Covid-19.

The order issued by the principal secretary, health, government of MP Pallavi Jain Govil, had led to ‘outrage’ among gas victims and activist groups working for their cause as the hospital is run by the government of India’s department of health & research (DHR) and how well the hospital is serving the gas victims is regularly monitored by a division bench of M P high court on the order of the Supreme Court. The bench headed by the Chief Justice had been insisting on personal appearance of DHR secretary in the previous three hearings of the petition on medical care of gas victims to know what his department had done so far to comply with the apex court order of August 2012 to restore BMHRC in a condition that it serves the gas victims in the best possible manner. His alibi for absence due to Coronivirus threat in the country was also rejected by the judges.

The same hospital being abruptly taken over by the state government for designating it as an isolation centre for Coronavirus patients did not go down well with anyone. Gas victims and activist groups were joined by the Supreme Court Monitoring Committee to protest the evacuation of gas victims from the hospital, but failed.

“I talked to Pallavi Jain Govil twice on Wednesday, she appeared to be considerate She suggested the order can be reviewed if collector Bhopal has no problems. When I talked to the collector, he said there was no problem on his part and he would comply with whatever order he receives from above but the order was not revoked,” said Purnendu Shukla, a member of the monitoring committee.

Meanwhile, 86 patients undergoing treatment at the hospital, including five patients on ventilator have been evacuated. According to hospital sources, only one patient who is on ventilator and another serious patient in ICU are still there, but they are also being asked to go.

Shukla said that he had asked for a record as to where these patients have been shifted but it has not been provided to home till now.

Walking past the Vashi toll plaza, 40-year-old Malshetty Chavan told TOI: “We are a group of over 15 workers with families. We have been walking for over five hours from Bandra in Mumbai, where we used to work.”

Chavan said, “We have run out of money. We used to earn around Rs 250 per head daily at building construction sites. Since there will be a lockdown for three weeks, we have no option but to walk it to Karnataka. Otherwise what will we eat here?”

When told that the police is not allowing anyone to cross the state borders due to the lockdown, another migrant worker said: “There’s no one here to even give us one square meal. Our construction supervisor is also unreachable on his phone. Hence, we are walking.”

Several women were seen walking alongside, their heads covered with towels or sarees to protect themselves from the sun. All kept looking around constantly to see if they could source food or water from someone.

City-based activists said it is likely that more and more daily wage workers will hit the highways on foot, if the state government does not organize camps to provide them with essentials during the lockdown period.

“The government has announced schemes to give free food to the poor in the country during the lockdown. However, most of the food parcels will be distributed to registered labourers and workers. The daily wage migrant workers, who are mostly unregistered and exploited for cheap labour, will sadly not get any free food. Hence, there is a gap between what the government thinks and intends to do, and what really is transpiring on ground zero,” said city-based RTI activist Anarjit Chauhan.

293,['28/03/2020'],"‘Locked’ in, Divar residents struggle","The island, home to 8,000 people, got fresh supplies only on Friday

PANAJI: The island of Divar, whose sole connection to the mainland is by way of a ferry, faces its own piquant situation. Since the nationwide lockdown, its residents have been facing a severe supply crisis with their grocery stores cleaned out and life-saving drugs running out.

According to the island’s two panchayats, fresh grocery supplies arrived only on Friday and by Saturday a home-delivery system will be put in place.

The island is home to 8,000 people and ever since the lockdown the ferry plies once every two hours and suppliers who miss the ferry turn back.

“There is a problem in getting supplies because the ferry is after every two hours. I sent some of our boys to get stock from Uccasaim, but police beat them. The Naroa ferry is completely stopped. Our home has some stock of fish and rice, but for the last three days we have been having black tea, which many of the elderly don’t like,” said Sr Monica Rodrigues, who runs the Lar Santa Margarida (home for the senior citizen) in Piedade.

Though the chief minister allowed grocery stores to remain open, most remained closed on the island. While there is a pharmacy, some of the more critical medicines are available only with bigger chemists in Panaji.

“Just three days earlier, some people were struggling for medicines. People have to cross over to Old Goa and Panaji to get certain medicines. Some have medicines for just 10-15 days,” Jerry D’Souza, a prominent resident on the island, said.

Sarpanch of Sao Matias, Mohan Volvoikar said that of the six to eight shops on the island, two agreed to seek permission from the deputy collector and on Friday received stock. “Vegetables are not there, but by Sunday or Monday, the horticulture department will supply vegetables,” he said.

294,['28/03/2020'],Madhya Pradesh breathes easy as air pollution levels go down,"BHOPAL: Barely a week into the nationwide lockdown — with little vehicular movement — pollution levels have dipped in major cities of the state, said officials on Friday.

Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows Bhopal, Indore, Gwalior, Ujjain improved in just a week’s time, with Jabalpur being the only exception. Construction activities, which have come to a halt also helped.

Data says that air quality of Bhopal on March 20 was ‘moderate’; it turned into ‘good’ on Friday. In Indore, the air quality was ‘moderate’, which turned into ‘satisfactory’ on Friday. Air quality of Gwalior was ‘satisfactory’ on March 20, which moved to ‘good’ on Friday. In Ujjain too, the air quality has changed to ‘good’ from ‘moderate’ for the past one week. Surprisingly, air quality remained ‘satisfactory’ from March 20 till this report was filed on Friday.

Air quality is measured taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). While vehicle emissions lead to rise in SO2, increase in nitrogen oxide is due to human activity. PM-10 is caused by dust and construction, including building of roads. PM2.5 levels are sensitive to dust, human activity and climatic conditions. Of the four, officials said, PM2.5 is the most harmful as it causes severe lung diseases.

Jankalyan Rakthpedhi has started such camps for a week and has appealed to citizens to donate blood so that the city hospitals do not run out of it during emergencies.

Vinay Shouche, administrative officer of Jankalyan Raktpedhi , said, “Every year there is a shortage of blood in the blood banks during summer. This year, we cannot conduct many camps due to lockdown.”

According to him, due to the lockdown, the number of accidents has decreased and thus the demand for blood has also reduced.

A corporator of the Nashik Municipal Corporation , Varsha Bhalerao, donated blood on Thursday at the camp organised by Jankalyan Rakthpedhi.

Nearly 63 people have donated blood in the last two days at Jankalyan Raktpedhi, she added.

Rotary Club also organised a blood camp on Thursday at Ashwini Shraman Sector.

“We had come to know from Arpan Blood Bank that they are falling short of their supply. We arranged a van near the Ganesh temple and informed our contacts from the vicinity of 400m. We asked only two people at a time to come ,” said Jayant Pawar, member of an NGO.

Rajendra Lodha, president of Navkar Group (NGO), CIDCO has sought permission from the police authorities to organise a blood donation camp.

CHENNAI: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has stopped all ongoing road projects worth more than Rs 17,000 crore in the state following the complete lockdown of the country to fight Covid-19 outbreak.

NHAI officials said 22 road projects under the Centre’s Bharatmala scheme to develop 1,076 km national highways at a cost of Rs 17,800 crore were at various stages of implementation in Tamil Nadu.

“After completing land acquisition and clearing the legal hurdles, a few of the projects had gathered momentum a couple of months ago. Now, the lockdown has pulled us back. It can even lead to fresh legal disputes, cost escalation and inordinate delay in completion of the projects,” said a senior official in NHAI.

Eight projects, covering 558 km of roads, were being implemented in Chennai Region. They include Rs 1,250 crore project to six-lane the 148 km stretch of NH 46 from Krishnagiri to Walaja, Rs 1,020 crore project to four-lane Trichy-Kallagam section of NH 227 and Rs 1,071 crore project between Kallagam and Meensuriti on NH 227. These projects are being implemented in Kancheepuram, Villupuram, Krishnagiri and Chennai districts.

In Madurai region 14 ongoing projects were put on hold. The total cost of the projects was Rs 11,416 crore. They include improvement of 517 km of roads on NH 45 C, 45 E, 47, 67, 209, 785 and 785 E. Six of them are worth Rs 1,000 crore each. The projects were being implemented in Thanjavur, Nagarcoil, Madurai and Dindigul districts.

Till Thursday evening, nobody had checked into isolation at any of the hotels. T S Walia, former national president of Federation of Hotels and Restaurants Association of India (FHRAI) said the association was hoping that in next 24 hours people would start arriving.

“In most of the hotels there is no boarder. A skeletal staff has been kept to serve those who will stay in isolation, but they want to go home too. It will be better if people start coming to these facilities soon,” he added.

Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) has offered 645 rooms in 32 hotels and guest houses for this facility. Walia added that the state had asked for another 200 rooms for isolation. “We are looking for more rooms, but the problem is that the state wants this in bulk. Ideally, we need 200 rooms at a few places. This is a little difficult. If required, we may request the health department to talk directly to some hotel owners,” he added.

Incidentally, in a circular on Wednesday evening, the government has included establishments used or earmarked for quarantine facilities on the essential list. It may be noted that the Ambuja Neotia Group, too, has offered 30 suites in The Ffort Raichak resort to the government for an isolation facility.

The Bengal government had sought help from hoteliers to arrange rooms for isolation last Sunday. The health and tourism departments had asked HRAEI to request their members to assign rooms for this purpose.

HRAEI secretary Sudesh Poddar pointed out that all association members who have agreed to assign rooms are ready to offer this facility on a cost-to-cost basis. “The charges will be Rs 3,000-Rs 5,000, depending on categories (three-four star or five-star), which would include breakfast, lunch and dinner,” he added. Poddar said that at present, there are 2,500-2,600 rooms in the five-star and five-star deluxe categories in the city while there are 2,000+ rooms in the three-four star categories. Besides, there are 15,000 rooms in non-star category hotels in the city and surrounding areas.

Bhopal: Despite being a Friday, most mosques in the state capital remained shut and no mass Friday namaz was held.

Bhopal Shahar Qazi Syed Mustaq Ali Nadvi in a notice had urged Muslims to offer namaz at homes and refrain from congregating in large numbers.

Taj-ul-Masjid, among Asia’s largest mosque, was closed with a notice by the qazi pasted on the entrance. The notice by Shahar Qazi said, “There will be no Friday prayers at Taj-ul-Masajid. Namaz will resume only after further directives.”

Abdul Arif Qureshi, a resident of Karond area told TOI, this is the first time that mosques are closed. “It is a good move in the present circumstances,” he said.

There were no mass prayers at Soofiya Masjid at Koh-e-Fiza and other mosques as well.

Talking to TOI, Abul Hasan, a resident of Koh-e-Fiza said, “This is the first time that Friday namaz was offered by people at home. Even during the Bhopal Gas Disaster, Friday prayers was not disrupted in the city. This is an extraordinary situation that none of us has thought about. The need of the hour is to help ourselves by following government orders and staying at home.”

Earlier on Thursday, an offence was registered against a cleric and 27 others, for allegedly defying the coronavirus lockdown, by offering prayers at a mosque in Islampura locality of the city, police said on Friday.

303,['28/03/2020'],"5,000 infrared thermometers arrive in city for nCoV check","Kolkata: A SpiceXpress freighter on Thursday morning landed in Kolkata with a consignment of 5,000 infrared thermometers that are key to early detection of Covid-19 cases in the absence of adequate diagnostic kits. The shipment that arrived from Hong Kong was swiftly cleared by Customs. The devices are expected to be distributed across various facilities in the city, including hospitals and fever clinics, as well as health facilities in the districts.

The need to check temperature using infrared thermometers has become vital as conventional mercury thermometers cannot be used for fear of contamination. The infrared thermometer does not require body contact since it checks temperature by sensing the infrared energy radiated by the body. The gadget also reads the temperature in a fraction of the time required by mercury thermometers, thereby enabling mass checks in facilities like hospitals, airports, offices, malls and hotels.

With demand for infrared thermometers shooting up worldwide, it has been difficult to procure the instruments. And with all commercial passenger flights banned in India till at least April 15, the consignment for Bengal had to be brought on a freighter operated by SpiceJet.

The Boeing 737 SpiceXpress aircraft is the only one that is touching down at Kolkata airport every day. Blue Dart, which also operated every day, cancelled its Kolkata-Dhaka shipment. There is uncertainty if Qatar and Cathay Pacific will each continue to operate two freighter services to Kolkata every week. Qatar last operated a freighter on Monday. Cathay is yet to operate one after the lockdown. Alliance Air is expected to operate a chartered fight.

Sources said domestic carriers are planning to convert their passenger planes to cargo during the lockdown.

This was part of the Adoration and recitation of the Rosary by vicar general Dominic Gomes on Wednesday — at the Feast of Annunciation.

“In the PM’s 21 days of lockdown , we see a Biblical similarity to the book of Daniel, chapter 9:15 where Prophet Daniel closes the door outside and, in obedience behind the locked door, he prays and fasts for 21 days, doing God’s will and saves his people,” the vicar said. He called out to the followers of the archdiocese to similarly spend time in prayers, because at the end of the lockdown, once again life will beckon. “As we worship, He will heal us from Covid-19,” the Adoration prayer read.

During the recitation of the Rosary, a five-step prayer, the traditional words from the Bible were suffixed with references to coronavirus to pray for healing.

Just like the previous Sunday, this week too, Archbishop Thomas D Souza has decided to read online mass that will be broadcast on social media for all parishioners to see and participate in. Churches are shut for prayers at the moment and in this month of Lent, this initiative had made sure parishioners are not missing their Sunday service.

MUMBAI: The supply of vegetables and other essentials to the city improved marginally on Friday, thanks to the distribution of the Essential Services Pass to deliverymen, shop workers and transporters. The pilot exercise has worked in certain locations like APMC Vashi and Andheri East.

Meanwhile, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said the state had taken a “courageous decision” to allow essential shops to be open 24 hours in the time of the lockdown. “There is no reason for the public to crowd shops and markets. Essential supplies will be smooth now,” he said.

Indeed, the movement of vehicles carrying vegetables, fruit and foodgrains to and from APMC Vashi smoothened after the RTO and APMC administration issued passes and vehicle stickers to transporters. In all 765 trucks loaded with onion-potato, vegetables, fruit, grains and spices arrived in the five market yards. “The market is limping back to normal. Supplies will increase on Saturday,” said APMC deputy secretary Krishnakant Pawar. The relief percolated to markets in Mumbai. More varieties of vegetables were available and prices cooled by Rs 20 per kg.

The pass also helped small retail outlets and vendors who could ply their trade without facing police ire. Virutheeswaran Nadar, who runs Egg Centre at Sion-Koliwada locality in GTB Nagar, applauded new passes.

E-commerce companies are facing jurisdictional issues in Mumbai as all their warehouses are in Bhiwandi. So, these companies have to deal with both Mumbai and Thane authorities to get clarity on passes for delivery.

Meanwhile, despite the state's attempt, no shops were open 24/7. Medical stores worked to schedule, and shops in Borivli shut at the usual hour.

In coming days, though, milk supplies from Kolhapur and Pune may become erratic as labour, fodder and transportation have trickled to a minimum. Buffalo shed owners in Mumbai say they are not getting fodder.

LPG outlets in Thane and one along Ambekar Marg, Parel, saw long lines as deliverymen were scarce. Elsewhere in Mumbai, gas deliverymen were seen on their tricycles. A Bandra man got his refill in 12 hours of booking. Officials of BPCL and HPCL said there was no shortage of cylinders. Both issued directives to dealers to look into grievances.

In Tardeo, vegetable vendors visited large societies. Vasai-Virar civic body has said at ration shops, yellow card holders will get 12kg rice at Rs 3 a kg, 10 kg wheat at Rs 2 a kg and 14 kg sugar at Rs 20 a kg.

Dadar wholesale vegetable market to be partly shut

In a bid to to curb overcrowding, Mumbai police along with the BMC has decided to partially shut the Dadar vegetable wholesale market on Senapati Bapat Marg. Instead, wholesale vendors entering the city will be stopped at various locations in eastern and western suburbs and retailers will be asked to pick up what require from them. The initiative is most likely to take off on March 29.

Cops also helped an eight-year-old suffering from thalassaemia to reach Shisu Sadan from the Jinjira Bazar area. In Baguiati, Bidhannagar City Police arranged an ambulance for a couple after their daughter developed a respiratory ailment.

“Around 12.15am on Thursday, Itisha Das from South Tangra Road went into labour. While she was being taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, the vehicle broke down near the GK Road-Christopher Road crossing. They tried to hire another vehicle, but there was none due to the lockdown. The constable at a kiosk nearby alerted the Tangra OC, who sent sub-inspector S C Kotal and a woman cop to the spot. They drove the woman and her family to RG Kar in a truck owned by Tangra police station. She was declared safe by doctors,” said DC (eastern suburban) Ajoy Prasad.

At Jinjira Bazar, an eight-year-old child with thalassaemia got stuck on the road as time ran out for his transfusion. The southwest traffic guard OC, Prasenjit Chatterjee, helped arrange an ambulance and provided a pilot car so that the family could reach a hospital in Bhowanipore at the earliest. The cops also prepared a list of blood donors in case there was a shortage.

During patrol, a Baguiati police team met a couple ,Tapas and Jhuma Das, and their daughter who was suffering from respiratory trouble. “Cops thought of calling an ambulance, but when the couple said they couldn’t afford one, the cops took them to BC Roy Sishu Mangal Hospital,” said an officer.

JAIPUR: In his 27 years of service, 50-year-old Rajkumar Yadav never thought that it will be his job which will one day make him proud.

Today, Yadav’s heart swells with pride when even those unknown to him walk upto him and appreciate his role in maintaining regular water supply in these testing times. “I have been doing this for almost three decades. Its only now people are looking at my service in a different light and appreciate it very much,” said Yadav.

The Panipech Pump House where Yadav is posted had a work strength of 40, which has been brought down to 12. In the supply department, four of the 8 employees report in shifts to work.

“Those who live far away have been allowed to stay at home. Why the unnecessary risks?” he says. Yadav has been reporting for duty, which involves distribution of water every day since the coronavirus outbreak. He starts at 6 am till 2 pm after which another person takes over.

Everyday, he has to keep a watch on the Bisalpur water supply in the city. Quantity of chlorine has to be monitored and supply has to be on time. Yadav explains, “We are working in shifts. We have to be vigilant in these times as the load has increased. People are staying indoors so water usage has risen. Tubewells that were not unused have started functioning to supply more water. We have increased 15 minutes timing in all the areas for handwash and sanitising.”

He describes his work as a service to the nation. “This job has given me everything. Potential to feed my family, educate my sons and independence. Now, when the times are bad, it is our duty to serve the people. This is also a service to the nation,” said Yadav, who is dressed in a suit, headgear and mask. He wears these to work every day and makes it a point to disinfect them at home everyday using a home-made alcohol-based sanitizer.

“Precautions are necessary as I live in a joint family which includes my elderly parents. My son is a pharmacist and has to go to the shop, too. Both of us take precautions and are particular about following the guidelines of frequent handwashes, use of sanitisers and minimum physical contact with others,” he says.

This is the first time in his life he has seen such crisis in the country. Yadav appealed to people to stay at home and contribute to the nation. Thousands like me are working day and night to make it these difficult times easier. If people are not following the rules than our sacrifice is waste, ” he signed off.

311,['28/03/2020'],These TN workers trudged 80km from Karnataka,"Krishnagiri: Stranded in Karnataka without any work and earnings to run their families due to national lockdown, at least 136 Tamils returned to their native villages in Tiruvannamalai district on Friday. The journey back home was nothing but a harrowing tale for all of them.

Working in different parts of Karnataka, they first managed to reach Majestic bus station in Bengaluru city in trucks. From there, they started walking home at 2am on Friday.

They reached Hosur, which is nearly 40km away, at 8am and officials at the check post could do little to stop them. They walked for another 40km, but this time the Krishnagiri police stopped them near the office of district superintendent of police. Most of the workers were denied payments by their employers, going against Centre’s orders.

M Samikannu, of Cheyyar in Tiruvannamalai district, said he was working in a factory at Tumkur in Karnataka. “The factory downed its shutters on Tuesday night and the owner asked us not to come for work until the coronavirus issue was sorted out.” A daily wager, he used to earn Rs 300 a day with which he used to run the family. He decided to return home as there was no other way to earn bread and butter for his family during the lockdown period. When he reached Tumkur bus stand with his wife and two children on Wednesday, the area was deserted and there was no public transport available. Left with no other option, he waited there and managed to get into a truck laden with vegetables that was heading to Bengaluru city on Thursday evening.

“The truck driver demanded Rs 500 per head. I paid him the money as we were desperate to reach home after such a tiring wait at the bus stand,” Samikannu said. He shelled out Rs 2,000 to reach Bengaluru city, which is 75km away from Tumkur.

From Bengaluru, he joined other Tamils from his district and started walking to their native early on Friday as there was no other way out.

T Kishore Kumar, another member of the team, said he was working in a coffee estate in Coorg. A native of Gingee in Tiruvannamalai district, he was also accompanied by his family members.

The group reached Krishnagiri town on Friday morning. Police officials stopped them and contacted collector S Prabhakar after the team members recounted their harrowing tale. The collector subsequently directed transport department officials to arrange them buses to return to their native. Revenue officials, meanwhile, provided them food and water. Later, they were screened for Covid-19 symptoms and taken to their native places in Tiruvannamalai district in two buses.

Many went on a stockpiling spree, crowding supermarkets and medical shops. At such a time, one policewoman helped restore calm among hundreds of residents of Pulikeshinagar, east Bengaluru.Armed with a public address system, ACP Tabarak Fathima , 32, has been going around several localities, giving pep talks to residents, playing songs about staying in and sanitising one’s hands and spreading the message of hope.The officer has so far visited Richards Town, Netaji Road, Diamond District in Domlur and Polluramma slum in Doddigunta, Cox Town, with similar songs and messages, and now hopes to cover every locality in her sub-division.Videos of Fathima have gone viral on social media with hundreds of people appreciating the move. In one such video shot at Richards Town and posted by Bengaluru police on Instagram, Fathima can be seen giving a new twist to the song ‘Hum Honge Kamyaab’ (We shall overcome) and singing “We shall stay at home, we shall sanitise.” It was viewed more than 24,000 times.“When the first announcement came, I went around the city and realised everybody was scared. When you are in fear, people need some hope. ‘Hum Honge Kamyaab’ is a song of hope,” Fathima told TOI. “The moment people hear there’s a lockdown, the first thing that comes to their mind is ‘where will my food come from’? The lockdown’s purpose is to ensure people don’t come close to each other and this can’t be achieved if they are panic buying at crowded supermarkets. I realised it was very important to assure people their access to essential commodities is secure,” she said.“Every day, even when I get a little bit of time, I try to visit people and talk to them. Public-police cooperation is extremely important now,” the ACP added.Residents of localities she has visited have also posted videos of the ACP addressing them. “What an excellent speech, reassuring us that all essential services will not be affected, yet calmly asking us to stay indoors and not panic. Am talking about this police officer who came to Davis Road this afternoon. This was outside my apartment today,” tweeted @sai_ganesh, a resident of Davis Road, along with a video. The post was shared over 1.9k times.“All essential services, be it medical or groceries, are open like any other normal day. Please do not get scared or panic thinking you are not getting essential commodities. Milk, vegetables, fruits and medical services, everything is available and is getting transported to your local stores,” the police officer can be heard calmly informing residents in the 2 minute and 20 second video clip.Awareness is keyFathima, who joined city police in December 2019, sets out in the morning, at times as early as at 6am, and is on the field till late at night. “The police department has been at it 24*7. If there is a situation that demands our presence, we get on the job right away,” she said. Speaking about how cops are keeping themselves calm in this scenario, the ACP pointed out that awareness is key. “We have educated police officers at all levels on the dangers of the virus, how it spreads and the precautionary measures to be taken. We maintain distance between the staff and between the staff and public as well. Out stations are sanitised every day and we also have a hand wash and sanitising facility on the premises,” she said",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cop-gives-pep-talk-plays-music-to-chase-away-hopelessness/articleshow/74854582.cms

314,['28/03/2020'],Doc who treated Thai patients in Erode develops symptoms,"Coimbatore: The Railway Hospital in Podanur was shut down on Friday morning after a doctor, who recently reported for duty, developed Covid-19 symptoms. The doctor had earlier treated the two Thailand nations, who tested positive for the virus, at the Perundurai government hospital in Erode. While the doctor said she had not met anyone in the hospital or consulted any patient, the hospital shut itself down as a precautionary measure. At least five people - including her husband, two children and a maid – have been isolated as they were in contact with her.

Meanwhile, health department officials in the city have sent throat swabs and blood samples of two suspected cases, including that of the doctor, to King Institute Chennai for re-testing as the tests conducted at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital’s Covid-19 testing centre were inconclusive.

Officials have, however, begun providing treatment to both the patients, one of them a woman with a travel history from North India. “Both have symptoms and while the doctor had direct contact with a positive patient, the woman has a travel history,” an official said.

The officials are also tracing the contacts of these two patients. “The doctor says she has not met anyone in the railway hospital and in Perundurai after treating the Thai nationals. The names of few that she does recollect are being passed on to Erode public health department for tracing. The other victim said she had travelled to the city from North India by train last week. So, we are getting details from the railways on people who travelled in the coach with her and trying to trace them,” said a senior district administration official. Both the patients are admitted to the ESI Hospital, along with the other Covid-19 patients in the region - the 25-year-old Spain returnee and the 47-year-old businessman from Tirupur.

In another instance, 15 more patients were admitted to the ESI Hospital on Friday. While six of them are contacts of suspected Covid-19 patients, four are with travel history from abroad and symptoms. The remaining five are people who have travelled within the country.

NASHIK: The city police have granted permission to over 1 ,200 people who were in need of medical emergency to travel within the city for health purposes in the past two days.

In the past two days, police received 5,000 requests through the helpline numbers.

On Wednesday night, the police released the helpline numbers on which people could request for travel permission within the city.

The senior police officials said that they were getting lot of calls from people all across the state, as the number that was published went viral

Under this system, the concerned citizens have to give their name, address, vehicle numbers, photo, the reason for the need to travel.

The police on verifying the details of the applicants and the documents sent on the numbers through Whatsapp grants permission or rejects the request.

The police said that the permissions were granted only for medical emergencies. The city with a population of approximately 18 lakh has a large number of people suffering from some ailment. There are also incidents of someone suffering from cardiac arrest, some kind of injury, or in need of dialysis, chemotherapy and other such medical necessities.

Since the police have barred the use of vehicles in the city, it has become a major problem for citizens to go to hospitals. The helpline thus proved handy for citizens.

A senior police officer of the rank of ACP, on the condition of anonymity, said, “There were also some instances in which the callers did not have any means of transportation to take their patient to a hospital. In five cases, we arranged ambulances and send them to the callers’ address.”

The officer said that the police would not reject anyone’s request if it is a medical emergency and would ensure that the patient is rushed to the hospital at the earliest. However, people think that they could also get permission for going to a grocery store, medical store, vegetable market and others. They are available in every lane and by-lane of the city and people can easily walk to such places by taking proper precautions.

The officer added that more than 3,000 requests were rejected. The police also take note of the vehicle number, photo IDs of the caller so that the police permission cannot be misused.

Police commissioner Vishwas Nangare-Patil said, “We conducted the trials of the drones in the Old city area on Friday. The actual deployment of the drones would begin from Saturday. With the help of the drones and a public announcement system, we would also make appeals to people to stay indoors.”

“If people do not pay heed to the announcements and continue to linger outside, action will be taken against them based on the footage received from the drone,” Nangare-Patil added.

Inspector Seetaram Kolhe said eight cameras would be put to use across the city. He added that despite the lockdown, people were rushing to the markets and not listening to the police appeals.

“The aim is to keep check on areas where people are neglecting the prohibition orders. Action will be taken against those found violating the orders,” said Ashok Bhagat , senior inspector of the Panchavati police station.

The drone will also deter people from venturing out of their houses unnecessarily as they know that their images can be captured by the cameras, Bhagat added.

The police have been constantly appealing to people not to venture out of their homes unless they have to purchase essential commodities. However, citizens are not taking the appeal seriously. Action has been taken against 295 people from March 22 to March 26 under section 188 of the IPC.

317,['28/03/2020'],"Moratorium: RBI cuts rate by 75 bps, steepest in over 10 years; you can defer EMIs by 3 months","MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday cut interest rates by 75 basis points (bps)—the sharpest in over a decade. It also made available Rs 3.74 lakh crore of additional liquidity to banks and allowed almost all borrowers to defer loan repayments by three months.The measures are aimed at buying time for the government to deal with the coronavirus crisis by preventing stressed borrowers from being ejected from the banking system and avoiding bond markets going into a freeze due to the sudden cessation caused by the lockdown.Advancing the monetary policy committee meeting by a week, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said, “This decision was warranted by the destructive force of the coronavirus. It is intended to mitigate the negative effects of the virus, revive growth, and above all, preserve financial stability.”Das said that along with earlier measures, the liquidity made available amounts to 3.2% of the country’s GDP.The rate cut had its impact with the State Bank of India cutting interest rates on loans by 75 bps. Besides the conventional rate cut, RBI took an unconventional step of making available Rs 1 lakh crore to banks through targeted long-term repo (lending) operations. This allows banks that have bought bonds from private issuers to finance the purchases at a cheap rate.Another Rs 1.37 lakh crore was released to banks by reducing the cash reserve ratio (CRR)—a portion of deposits that are impounded by RBI. This reduction in CRR by one percentage point of total deposits will release Rs 1.37 lakh crore to banks. Another Rs 1 lakh crore was made available through a marginal standing facility for emergency loans.In addition to making available funds, RBI incentivised banks to buy corporate bonds by exempting them from any writedown due to rise in interest rates in future.To push banks to lend, RBI reduced its reverse repo rate—the rate it offers banks for their surplus funds—by 90 bps to 4%. “The moratorium provides relief to borrowers from being tagged as non-performing assets. Going forward there will be a need to have a restructuring scheme for sectors like hospitality and aviation that are most affected by the crisis,” said Rajkiran Rai, managing director & CEO Union Bank of India.“As regards the outlook for 2020-21, apart from the continuing resilience of agriculture and allied activities, most other sectors of the economy will be adversely impacted by the pandemic, depending upon its intensity, spread, and duration. If Covid-19 is prolonged and supply chain disruptions get accentuated, the global slowdown could deepen, with adverse implications for India,” said Das.The measures come on the back of a Rs 1.7 lakh crore relief package for the poor through direct benefit transfer announced by the finance minister on Friday. According to C H S S Mallikarjuna Rao, managing director & CEO , Punjab National Bank, another relief is the RBI decision to defer prescriptions for high capital requirements to September 2020. “However, challenges remain in terms of transmitting these measures to customers amid social distancing. Effective digital and electronic delivery to the last mile will remain the key issue,” he said.While the stock markets opened positive to the news of an MPC meeting, the sensex closed 131 points lower. “Unlike the Fed or the ECB, the RBI did not announce direct purchases of corporate bonds or commercial paper, but instead passed the buck on to the banks; this could have led to the initial market disappointment post the policy meeting. Moreover, it was disappointing to see no special credit facilities for the worst-hit sectors like aviation, hospitality and an absence of direct liquidity support for the NBFCs,” said Abheek Barua, chief economist, HDFC Bank.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74855946,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-207803,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-cuts-rate-75-bps-steepest-in-over-10-years-you-can-defer-emis-by-3-months/articleshow/74855943.cms

In fact, Gujarat government on Friday announced that the COVID-19 Tracker App, developed by SMC, will now be replicated in Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Vadodara and Rajkot to effectively monitor home quarantined people in respective cities.

""SMC was the first civic body to develop a special app to track home quarantined people on a real-time basis. Our in-house team developed the app within 48 hours. Google and Apple are not approving applications quickly at present, so we are distributing this app from our website. Till now, 3005 people have downloaded this app and we are constantly monitoring them,'' Banchhanidhi Pani, municipal commissioner, Surat, told TOI.

""Every home quarantined person has to upload their selfie and status twice in a day on this app. This has helped us warn 42 home home quarantined people who were violating the rules and we have issued warning to them,” Pani added.

""Till Friday evening, we have 4,331 people under quarantine including those at home in Surat city, the largest numbers in the state,'' Pani said.

SMC has adopted three Ts approach to deal with the outbreak - Track, Test and Treat.

Eight FIRs have been filed against those found violating home quarantine.

SMC's two other initiatives also found place in good practices. These include self declaration forms on its website by travellers in the city and voluntarily declaration of their travel history. The civic body has has started a toll free helpline number (1-800-123-800) where citizen can share details about travellers or suspects.

The details are verified by SMC team including health officials. A field team visits the location and if the details provided on helpline is verified, the individual is asked to stay in home quarantine and assigned unique tracker ID. They are asked to download SMC COVID-19 tracker app.

322,['28/03/2020'],"Govt relaxes rules, firm on social distancing","As the lockdown entered the third day on Friday, the state government appeared to relax the rules to ensure adequate supply of essentials.

More vegetable markets were opened across the state and facilities were made for door delivery of provisions from super markets ending anxiety of the public about shortage of essentials.

Uzhavar Sandhais came alive after a gap of five days across the state and in some places the markets were shifted to spacious locations to ensure public maintain the one metre distance among each other while buying goods.

The R S Puram and Singanallur Uzhavar Sandhais were reopened for three hours on Friday and the authorities said 10 more major markets will be opened during their usual work hours from Saturday.

In Tuticorin, the bus stand was turned into a vegetable market to accommodate more traders and public. “The prices of vegetables have come down after spiking up for the past few days,’’ said KM Swaminathan, an insurance agent from Vadavalli.

In Madurai, traders at central vegetable market have decided to sell goods only to retail shop owners instead of public to prevent mass gatherings.

“This ensures that public don’t crowd here and get chased away by police. They can buy vegetables from retail stores in their locality,’’ P S Murugan, president of vegetable market traders association, said.

Civic bodies have also roped in provision stores for door delivery of goods. While 20 such stores were enrolled in Coimbatore, Madurai corporation has taken on board 26 shops.

Police too refrained from beating motorists but have started booking more cases and in some places confiscating the bikes of loiterers.

But the cops had to grapple with slow emergence of offences like theft and illicit selling of liquor. In Coimbatore, a grocery store was broken open and 50kg of rice and edible oil were stolen while in Namakkal police arrested two men for selling liquor discretely. “We have seized 2,650 bottles of liquor kept for sales at Namakkal and 144 bottles in Tiruchengode,’’ said Namakkal SP Arivarasu.

Though much of the roads were deserted, police felt the compliance to curfew was not total in some places like Cuddalore and Thanjavur where people were stepping out in droves, apparently to buy essentials. The vegetable market in Cuddalore for instance was so crowded and police had to chase them away.

Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami made a fervent appeal to the public not to venture out unnecessarily. “The government has ensured that there was adequate supply of vegetables. But people should cooperate and not crowd the markets. Section 144 is being imposed for you, your family and the country,’’ he said in Chennai.

The officials have also permitted weddings and allowed people to prepare for the ceremonies with a restriction that not more than 30 people should congregate for the events. Coimbatore collector K Rajamani has allowed 30 weddings to be conducted on March 30, an auspicious day. “The weddings were fixed much before the curfew. I have told the entire wedding hall should be sanitized and all the participants should wear masks,” Rajamani said.

“I have given permission to conduct 30 marriages that were fixed earlier. Only 30 people can gather and the places should be sanitized. The couple and their family members should wear face masks,” said Rajamani.

People are approaching the collector to seek permission to travel to other districts. “We are issuing permission letters to only those who have genuine reasons to travel,” he said.

The district administration has set up a special control room (0422-1077) manned by doctors for creating awareness about Covid-19. People can contact the toll-free number round-the-clock to clarify their doubts.

“Many people contacted the control room to inform about the houses that should be quarantined as people who returned from foreign countries are staying there. Some callers informed us about the people in self- quarantine, who had come out of their houses. The control room staff have been advised to contact the police control room and public health department officials for further action,” said Rajamani.

The state government has allotted Rs 3 crore for the district to procure materials to prevent Covid-19 spread, the collector said. The city corporation has received Rs 1 crore from the state government. The district also received Rs 15 lakh from the disaster management fund and Rs 12.5 lakh from the DRDA fund.

324,['28/03/2020'],"Worried over safety, pvt hosps reluctant to admit Covid-19 patients","Bengaluru: Of the 54 Covid-19 patients undergoing treatment in the state, only five are in private hospitals. Officials lament that private hospitals are not shouldering the Covid-19 burden to the extent they can, despite meetings held with their representatives twice in a week.

At Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases, the state’s nodal centre for Covid-19 treatment, all 15 isolation beds are occupied. Cases coming to RGICD are now being referred to other government hospitals.

The Federation of Healthcare Associations of Karnataka recently wrote to the government asking it to be ready for the fast-worsening situation with 2,000 critical care beds. The association offered some staff but there is no mention of private hospitals willing to admit patients.

According to private hospitals, the reason for their reluctance is non-availability of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and hydroxychloroquine tablets, which have been prescribed by ICMR for prophylactic treatment of healthcare professionals who will be involved in treating the infected.

“We have repeatedly brought the PPE situation to the government’s notice at every meeting but the equipment is still not available. If the situation does not improve, hospitals will have to shut down. We can’t compromise on the safety of our doctors, nurses and allied personnel,” said the representative of a leading hospital.

Medical education minister K Sudhakar had earlier stated that patients can choose the hospital at the time of admission and decide if they want to get treated in a private facility. There are 35 first responder private hospitals in Bengaluru, including some private medical colleges.

In Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, the governments have already moved forward by taking over some private hospitals. The Rajasthan government has taken over a hospital and asked it to shift all its patients to a government medical college. “If the directions are not followed, action will be taken as per IPC Section 188 and Section 57 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005,” says the Rajasthan circular, a copy of which is with TOI. The situation is similar in Madhya Pradesh, where two private hospitals in Indore have been taken over by the government.

Do not mix patients: Expert

Dr Nagendra Swamy, principal coordinator of Federation of Healthcare Associations Karnataka, said the need of the hour is to keep all Covid-19 patients in one isolated hospital instead of several hospitals which will have many other patients. “There are chances of healthcare workers contracting the infection, which is spreading fast. Private hospitals have other patients too. Medical professionals have to be fit. If they also get infected, where will people go?” wondered Dr Swamy.

NASHIK: The Nashik Regional Transport Office (RTO) has set up a control room at its premises to grant permission to transporters for supplying essential commodities to stores.

The aim is to ensure that the transporters of essential services are allowed to commute during the lockdown period. Transporters coming to the RTO during office hours would be given permission certificate.

A release from the Nashik RTO said that the control room has been set up on the instructions of transport commissioner’s office, Mumbai.

RTO official said that those who are unable to go to the RTO can get the transport certificate online by applying on mh15@mahatranscom.in

NASHIK: Police authorities in Nashik district have appealed to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to identify places where the destitute and poor can be served food during the ongoing lockdown.

Superintendent of police Arti Singh and deputy commissioner of police Amol Tambe have sent out the messages through social media platforms appealing to people to come forward and help those who are facing hardships due to the lack of work and money to buy food.

“Many workers belonging to the agricultural sector across the district are unable to feed themselves due to lack of labour. We have, therefore, appealed to citizens to come forth and contribute towards helping them,” Arti Singh said.

On the other hand, police have appealed to people to help them find safe haven for destitute or workers until the lockdown is lifted. “Many NGOs have started distributing food among homeless people. But, when the food trucks arrive at Gangaghat , Ramkund these people start crowding to collect food packets. It creates a chaos and it becomes impossible to maintain social distancing at such places,” Tambe told TOI.

The homeless are unable to maintain personal hygiene and that is another concern for the police authorities, he said.

“The idea is to find community halls or college premises where the homeless can be shifted in the groups of 100-200.,” Tambe added.

However, just 52 societies could provide all the details prescribed in the advertisement. G H Solanki, the deputy municipal commissioner, handling the project said a total of 2,144 families in 52 societies availed of the facility, and bought a total 8,095kg of vegetables.

Solanki said that majority of calls were those who thought the AMC was giving away free vegetables and backed out when we enumerated the costs.

Another set of people were placing orders for 5kg or 10kg but did not place orders when told the minimum requirement was 100kg.

According to the scheme, the society has have to nominate a representative who then places bulk orders — of 100kg or more including all vegetables — for the society with the AMC’s WhatsApp helpline number 94087-53064.

The civic body’s zonal representative will commission a vehicle for the society’s bulk purchase at the nearest vegetable market. A society representative will have to accompany the vehicle to the market.

Once the purchase is made, the AMC’s team will help load the vegetables at the market and unload them at the society’s entrance.

In all probability, it’s because he was starving . With the city in lockdown mode and eateries and food vendors shut, stray animals that feed on the leftovers, have been left nibbling at nothing.

Hopefully, not for too long. A group of animal lovers have formed online groups to feed stray dogs and cats in neighbourhoods around them.

Fashion designer Nandita Thirani has contacted a member of people residing at her apartment in a building off Theatre Road to join her in feeding strays on Camac Street, Russel Street, Park Street, Short Street, Wood Street and Chowringhee.

She has appealed on the WhatsApp group of the apartment for help and asked them to put their leftovers and a little extra in boxes at specific points from where she will pick up and distribute.

On Thursday morning, she and her daughter Anuradha, were seen distributing rice and chicken to dogs in these localities. “There’s no time to waste. It’s been over 48 hours that they have gone hungry. These stretches teem with food vendors on whom the dogs depend for food. With the stalls shut since Saturday, they are starving,” she said.

KMDA employee Deboshree Ganguly and her husband Kuntal Ghosh, was seen in several Salt Lake Blocks, Karunamoyee and Central Park, feeding strays. The duo have been passionately doing this for seven years now but have now extended their radius because of lockdown.

They already have neighbour Hansa Patodia with them. “We are a bit tense. Till date, we needed 450 kilos of rice but this time it will increase. However, even if we manage funds, we are not sure of the supplies. Hansa aunty is trying to contact suppliers,” Deboshree said.

An appeal to feed helpless strays has gone out from Stray Love, a shelter for strays run by Mystic Yoga Foundation, that is taking care of 125 strays. Sudhir, Chiroshree and Abhishek, the founders have connected with friends all over city to start feeding at the earliest.

Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar was informed of the inconvenience people have been facing to source cooked food during a meeting with officials on Friday. Pawar was told this was one of the main reasons why people step out. Pawar asked hoteliers to provide delivery services at the gates of housing societies. He also instructed cooks and delivery personnel to take proper precautions against Covid-19 and maintain hygiene.

An official from the deputy chief minister’s office said Pawar has also instructed all local authorities and district collectors to cooperate in this regard.

Based on a request from the Indian Medical Association (IMA), a naval long rage maritime reconnaissance aircraft flew to Delhi to bring back 60,000 face masks on Friday.

“An Ilyushin 38SD (IL-38) of the Indian Navy was promptly readied to depart INS Hansa for Palam Airport, New Delhi. The collection of the items at Delhi was coordinated by Air Force Station Palam and the aircraft returned to Goa with the masks on the same day,” a senior naval officer said.

The shipment of 60,000 face masks, ordered by IMA– Goa, is meant to offset its shortfall in the state.

The consignment was stuck at Delhi after the truck ferrying the consignment could not travel to Goa because of the lockdown.

Over the last week, people have rushed to pharmacies and bought out most of the face masks. Doctors and nurses, who are in the frontline in the fight against coronavirus, have also had to purchase their own face masks after government hospitals ran out of the crucial gear.

A few days earlier, a naval Dornier 228 aircraft helped airlift a team of doctors from Goa to Pune and back. The doctors went to a virology centre in Pune to undergo training in testing of coronavirus cases.

“We are in a huge problem as OMFED has suddenly stopped procuring milk. Also, milk being a perishable item it cannot be stored for long. For many farmers, dairy farming is the only source of income and they are in deep trouble,” said Shyam Rout, president of Koraput Malkangiri Nabarangpur and Rayagada Milk Union (KMNRMU).

According to Rout, many farmers, mostly tribals, have bought cows on loan. In the current situation, maintaining their dairy farms and arranging fodder for the cattle is a big challenge before them, said Rout.

Though the government said that milk booths will remain open, people are not coming out to buy milk products. “We don’t know for how long the deadlock will continue but if it stretches for a long time, then certainly it will ruin the dairy farmers,” said Rout.

Official data reveals that prior to the lockdown, the OMFED used to procure around 19,000 litres of milk from farmers. Of it, 80% of the milk was procured from Nabarangpur district.

“Since the lockdown there has been 80% decrease in our sales and now we hardly sell between 2,000 and 3,000 litres of milk a day. Though our booths are open, people are not coming to buy milk. So we are procuring less,” said Suprabhat Kanuango, plant manager of OMFED Jeypore.

According to the officer, the tea stalls and sweet shops were the major consumers of OMFED milk and since those are closed, there is less demand for milk.

“We have to make instant payments to farmers for the milk procured. When, there is no demand, how can we procure,” said Kanuango.

“Also, we have huge stock of milk products like paneer and sweet curd but there is no demand. We can’t store milk for a long period at our plant,” he added.

341,['28/03/2020'],Food shortage leaves many pet parents anxious,"Bengaluru: At a time when citizens are scrambling for groceries, pet parents in the city are a worried lot. Reason: getting meat and pet food is turning out to be a big challenge.

A large number of pet parents rely on chicken from neighbourhood stores and e-commerce retailers. With the lockdown in place, stores are closed and e-commerce retailers are mostly out of stock, leaving Bengalureans with no routine food for their pets.

“I live in an area where sourcing meat is difficult even on normal days. Now, the local stores are closed and police are stopping deliveries. Procuring food from e-commerce retailers is difficult as they too are mostly out of stock. My orders got cancelled several times and I’m yet to get the refunds. With a lot of difficulty, I got some meat on Friday. But I have to keep checking all the sites for availability as my dog has a medical condition and has to be on a meat-based diet,” said Thiyam Sophia, a medical student in Basavanagudi, who has two dogs.

“We have 130 dogs at our adoption centre and we usually need 50-60 kg of meat a day. Our regular vendor has been unable to source meat for us every day. So we have been forced to ration the chicken, limiting it to 25kg per day, complementing it with rice. We have found suppliers for bigger chains, but the rates are different. It’s a difficult situation,” explained Sanjana Madappa, who works for Compassion Unlimited Plus Action (CUPA), a shelter for dogs.

Many have, in fact, tweaked their pets’ diet owing to the scarcity. “We fed our dogs curd rice and rice with veggies for three days till we could source some meat,” said Prashant P, a resident of Hennur, who has a Labrador and an Indie.

Suchishmita Datta, a resident on Sarjapur Road, who owns an English Cocker Spaniel, Whiskey is worried as she doesn’t know when she’d get to buy meat again. “I also feed the street dogs here. We have to shift to rice and pulses. As we hadn’t anticipated this situation, we have to make do with the food we have stored for us, but it’s not sustainable,” said the IT professional.

Those relying on food from pet stores aren’t that lucky either. “We have been trying to get passes from the DCP’s office. There are frantic calls from pet parents. We open every couple of days for a few hours and help them. The shop was extremely crowded on Thursday. With no meat supply, people are stocking up on dog/cat kibble. Stocks are running out,” said Ritima Coelho, co-founder, Heads up for tails, Magrath road.

Officials in the department of animal husbandry said transportation of chicken will be smoother in the coming days and the problem will get sorted. “There’s no hard-and-fast rule on the shutdown of stores. The issue was with the transportation of chicken. There has been a meeting on this and things will be better soon,” said S Shashi Kumar, joint director, department of animal husbandry, BBMP.

The 24,000-kilogram vehicle has a 16,000-litre tank and a 500-litres additional tank.

Selvakumar said that police vehicles were also sanitized on Friday. “We have santisized all police stations in the city.”

Cops have been ordered to seize the vehicles of those who come out of homes deliberately, the officer said. “We found many motorists roaming through the city. They claimed they were out to buy medicines and vegetables. We have decided to seize the vehicles of such people.”

Just a few days into the nationwide shutdown, and some people are going to the extreme. A 29-year-old man forced to live in isolation committed suicide in his farm house at Maramadakki village in Pudukkottai district on Friday. And in Coimbatore, police rescued a man living alone who tweeted that he was having suicidal thoughts.

Police said C Suresh of Maramadakki village had gone into depression after his parents and elder brother refused to let him into the house last week fearing he could be infected with Covid-19.

Suresh had gone to the Maldives in 2019. After working there for a few months, he returned to Pudukkottai on January 15. From there he went to Tirupur in search of a job. He had to return because of the nationwide shutdown.

His family insisted that he remain in isolation and sent him to the farm house.

C Balu, his elder brother said they suspected Suresh may be infected with Covid-19 since he returned from the Maldives and decided to keep him in isolation for a few days.

“Though he didn’t like it, he stayed in the farm house and we didn’t allow children from our house to meet him,” said Balu.

On Friday morning, when a relative went to give him breakfast, Suresh was found hanging from the ceiling of the house.

The Aranthangi police have filed a case and are investigating.

In Coimbatore, a 35-year-old private bank employee from GN Mills tweeted that he was alone at home and was having suicidal thoughts. He tagged his tweet to the Union home ministry.

Coimbatore city police commissioner Sumit Sharan, who noticed the tweet, informed SP Sujit Kumar to send cops to GN Mills. The man told two sub-inspectors from the Thudiyalur station who rushed to the place that his parents were in Kotagiri in the Nilgiris and he unable to travel there. Police promised to take him to his parents’ house.

To distract him, they asked him to join them in checking vehicles at GN Mills junction.

Later, officials instructed police to allow him to go to Kotagiri in his own vehicle.

“His parents left for Kotagiri a week ago. So, he was alone in the house at GN Mills and he felt mentally sick. He has now reached his home town safely and is all right now,” said sub-inspector Dhamodaran.

350,['28/03/2020'],11 truck drivers stranded in Andhra return home,"Dharmapuri: The 11 truck drivers, who have been stuck in Andhra Pradesh without food and shelter since Tuesday, reached their homes on Friday.

MDMK MP Vaiko, meanwhile, urged the AIADMK government to help other stranded truck drivers from the state to return home. It is to be noted that at least 30 truck drivers from Salem and Dharmapuri districts are stuck in Jodpur in Rajasthan with loads.

M Chinnasamy, 29, of Thippireddihalli village near Bommidi in Dharmapuri, one of the 11 truck drivers returned home, said they had gone to Hyderabad to unload plywood sheets from Perumbavoor town near Cochin in Kerala. “Nine others are from my locality, while the remaining one is from Uthankarai in Krishnagiri district. We started from Kerala in six trucks on March 22,” he said.

When they reached Dharmapuri on Monday, they checked with the consignors, who asked them to proceed further without worrying about the lockdown. “We reached Andhra Pradesh at 2am on Friday, but police there denied permission to go further,” Chinnasamy said.

When the drivers attempted to buy vegetable, the local policemen chased them away. “One of the drivers, who was not part of our team, was injured in lathi-charge. We had nothing to eat until Wednesday night,” he said. Finally, the truck drivers posted a video mentioning their plight on social media. Following that, a few people from Dharmapuri contacted their friends in Hyderabad who arranged them food and shelter. They also took up the issue with officials in Hyderabad and arranged a vehicle for the drivers to return to their homes.

Similarly, another 30 drivers from Salem and Dharmapuri districts are stranded in Jodpur in Rajasthn with loads. They have urged the state government to take steps to bring them back at the earliest.

Vaiko said there are truck drivers who have been stuck in other states for more than 20 days. “They are struggling for food and water. The state government led by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami should take necessary steps to bring all the stranded truck drivers back to their native places at the earliest,” he said.

351,['28/03/2020'],"No doc to keep tabs, norms flouted: Patient at JP Hosp","Bhopal: “I feared getting infected with COVID-19 while awaiting my test report in JP hospital for four days,” said a person with foreign travel history. The person had walked into the district hospital to get tested and was kept in the isolation ward, that flouts many COVID-19 guidelines, including that of infection control. Subsequently, the person has tested negative for COVID-19.

The patient, whose identity is not being disclosed, narrated the ordeal. “I informed authorities about my self-isolation on returning to Bhopal. No one from the health department checked my status at home. Around day 9, I reached out for help as I had mild fever and requested a test. I was told that the test sample would be collected from my home. But with no response for two days, I walked into JP hospital seeking a COVID-19 test,” the person said.

Surprisingly, Bhopal IDSP, Dr Rashmi Jain, the nodal person for all travellers’ seeking test and guidence, blocked the person’s number. Despite repeated efforst by TOI, Jain did not respond to this.

On the 11th day after the traveller returned to Bhopal, the person waited for a doctor from 5 pm till 9.30 pm. Finally, the doctor arrived at 10 pm. “I was told that since I have reported the case to the call centre, I will not be allowed to return home until the test for COVID-19 is negative. If I did, police would be informed,” the affected person told TOI.

The person was led to an eight-bed COVID-19 isolation ward. “It lacked bed spacing requirements for infection control purposes. Men and women are in the same ward and a dedicated toilet for females was used by all,” the person said.

After samples were taken, for the next two days, no doctor checked on the suspected patients. “On day 4 of my hospital stay, I received a message that my test is negative. However, I was not allowed to leave since the doctor on duty was not present,” the person alleged.

Government guidelines for COVID-19 isolation instructs ‘patient placement: keep a minimum of 1–2 metre inter-bed distance’.

The minimum bed space in both single and multi-bed rooms should not be less than 3.6m (width) x 3.7m (depth). 2 Four-bed rooms require a total area of 72.5m, as per EU norms.

Ahead of ‘Corona control vertical’, a top COVID-19 team that directly reports to the state government, JP hospital managed to increase the width of signage in the hospital. When contacted, health department and JP hospital superintendent did not respond.

By the time shops opened on Friday in Margao, people had already formed serpentine queues outside, spilling onto the streets. Though slots were marked for them to maintain social distancing, these were breached at several places. The Margao municipal market and SGPDA market remained shut.

Despite several people, including foreigners, making a beeline at major grocery stores in Salcete ’s coastal belt early Friday morning, none was open due to lack of stocks.

While smaller shops upped their shutters at around 8.30am, vegetable and fruit vendors began doing business from 7am.

PUNE: The state department of prisons on Friday released around 450 undertrial prisoners from jails across the state, including 18 from the Yerawada prison, on bail as per court orders in view of the Covid-19 spread.

All these prisoners are facing trial for property offences, among others, in which the punishment is not more than seven years.

Additional director general of police (prisons) Sunil Ramanand told TOI, “On the first day, we have released around 450 undertrial prisoners from various jails in the state after receiving bail orders from the courts. All jail superintendents are holding meeting with district-wise judicial officials and are giving them the list of the prisoners to be released on bail because of coronavirus.”

He said the courts were issuing bail orders as per a letter released by the high power committee (HPC) set up at the behest of the Supreme Court. “The process of releasing the undertrial prisoners on bail will continue till all those, who meet the criteria set by the committee, are released from the central and district jails in the next few days,” Ramanand said.

These prisoners will be released on regular bail. Those involved in serious offences will be released on interim bail.

“The process for the release of convicts on parole sentenced to seven years or lesser terms will begin next week. This is because the state government is in the process of amending rule 9 of the Bombay Parole and Furlough Act 1959 authorising jail superintendents to grant emergency parole to convicts for a specific period because of coronavirus,” Ramanand said.

UT Pawar, superintendent of the Yerawada prison, told TOI, “On the first day, we have released 18 undertrial prisoners on bail as per the courts order. We have received a list to release another 80 such prisoners from the judiciary through our legal department. Since the list was received after the office hours, a decision to release them will be taken on Saturday after verifying their criminal antecedents.”

Pawar said, “For instance, If an undertrial prisoner has been granted bail in one case but s/he is involved in two or more cases, then we will submit a report to the judiciary giving details of his criminal antecedents. If the judiciary takes a call in granting them bail in other cases, the prisoner will be released forthwith.”

“If an UTP is involved in one case, s/he will be instantly released on bail on completion of legal formalities like receiving certified copies of the bail order and executing the bond before the concerned courts,” he added.

Following the successful run, it announced the plans to open around 10 major markets, which would function at their usual working hours , from Saturday. The move is expected to bring relief to many households that were struggling to procure their weekly supply of vegetables.

The district administration had on Thursday begun marking slots at a gap of every 1m in uzhavar sandhais and vegetable markets for people to stand and buy essentials, without compromising on social distancing.

While the slots were marked all the way from roads that lead up to the markets expecting a large turnout, uzhavar sandhais on Friday drew only a fraction of a crowd as the public were by and large not aware of their opening.

“In R S Puram, around 30 farmers from nearby locations had turned up, but it drew only around 100 customers over the three hours. They all stood in the slots and moved forward,” said a security officer at uzhavar sandhai. “Tomorrow, we expect more farmers and more customers.”

District collector K Rajamani also visited uzhavar sandhai and was satisfied with the progress.

After the successful trial run, the district administration said six uzhavar sandhai branches - four in the city and one each in Pollachi and Mettupalayam would start functioning from Saturday.

The collector also said the portion of Thiyagi Kumaran Market on Raja Street would function out of Gandhipuram city bus stand, while Ramar Temple Market in Ukkadam will function out of Ukkadam bus stand. Anna Market on Mettupalayam Road would, meanwhile, continue to function in the same area, but in shifts.

Officials said this decision was made as bus stands could offer more open space and flat ground, to ensure social distancing.

365,['28/03/2020'],Viral trail remains mystery in case of three Karnataka patients,"Bengaluru: Of the 64 positive Covid-19 cases in Karnataka so far, 15, or 23%, have no history of travelling to any of the affected countries. These patients include a doctor and a security guard besides wives, daughters and domestic helps who had come in contact with persons who tested positive after having travelled to an affected country.

However, three cases have left doctors puzzled as they do not appear – at least from an initial tracing of their movements – to have had contact with a positive patient. They include a 10-month-old baby boy, a 60-year-old man from Tumakuru who died on Friday and a 35-year-old Mysurean.

The baby though had accompanied his parents to Kerala, while the Tumakuru man had been to Delhi. The Mysurean was employed in the quality assurance section of a pharmaceutical company in Nanjangud near Mysuru and was in contact with many healthcare professionals, health department officials said.

“We will have to trace the movements of all three patients,” said Jawaid Akhtar, additional chief secretary, health and family welfare department. “We are in the process of tracing their travel history. There is no evidence of community spread yet. They could have come in contact with a positive patient.”

Officials admit that the spread of the virus does raise questions as all the other infections have been intra-family affairs or limited to primary contacts of the positive patients.

Three girls are among the infected, having contracted the virus from their fathers who had a history of travel to affected countries. Two of the girls are siblings. The girls’ mothers too tested positive.

The siblings, aged seven and nine, tested positive on March 25. Their father had returned from the Netherlands and tested positive in Bengaluru on March 21. His wife tested positive on March 23. The wife and daughter of the state’s first Covid-19 patient, a techie, also tested positive. Incidentally, all three have been discharged.

A 45-year-old man working as a security guard in Bengaluru tested positive on Thursday, four days after his 51-year-old employer returned from London tested positive on March 22. Three women working as domestic helps in households of positive patients with travel history to affected countries are among the infected.

“When we say suspected cases should be in home isolation, we don’t mean their interaction is restricted only to the world outside. They should be careful at home too,” said a senior health officer, who has been involved in monitoring home quarantine cases.

“There are mandatory self-hygiene and cough-hygiene guidelines that they have got to follow and they need to maintain the social distance at home too. Going by these cases, there appears to be sheer lapses. It’s extremely important to ensure possible carriers of the virus behave responsibly.”

The ordinance would be sent to governor for approval. “We will give details of the vote-on-account after getting the governor’s clearance,” information and public relations minister Perni Nani told the media on Friday.Sources said that the state government would be issuing an ordinance seeking withdrawal of Rs 70,900 crore from the consolidated fund from April, 1, 2020. The government is seeking permission for the withdrawal of the huge amount to meet the proposed welfare schemes as well as the health emergency cost.The annual budget was expected to be around Rs 1.8-1.9 lakh crore for 2020-2021. The officials readied the draft budget proposals before the outbreak of coronavirus . The officials in the finance ministry are now worried about further dip in the revenue in the coming financial year under the impact of Covid-19.At such rate, it was thought that the government might be seeking permission for withdrawal of around Rs 50,000 crore during the first quarter of the upcoming fiscal.However, the government is likely to issue an ordinance for over Rs 70,000 crore without mentioning any timeframe such as first quarter. “Although, we are expecting to completely control the spread of coronavirus and overcome the crisis shortly, it is very difficult to predict as to when the next session of assembly could be convened as the present situation is completely fluid. So, we thought of securing permission for withdrawal of funds without mentioning the time frame to avoid issuance of another ordinance,” said a senior minister.Sources said that chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy had expressed anguish about the conditions prevailing after the outbreak of Covid-19 at the cabinet meeting.He said there would be a severe impact on overall economic activity in the state as well as the country during the coming financial year. “We might require to walk the extra mile to ramp up revenue as we have to implement all our promises,” the CM told the ministers.",vijayawada,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74853809,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-134988,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vote-on-account-approved-cabinet-to-issue-ordinance/articleshow/74853810.cms

NASHIK: The directive from Lasalgaon APMC to the onion farmers for bringing their produce packed in sacks has evoked lukewarm response.

As workers involved in loading and unloading of onions are not available due to the lockdown, the AMPC on Thursday had decided to conduct onion auction in sacks after demands were made by the traders.

Accordingly, the APMC had appealed to the farmers to bring their produce in sacks so that it becomes convenient for the traders to load the materials in their trucks.

However, majority of farmers stayed away from taking part in the auction on Friday as they could not afford to buy sacks that cost Rs 30 per piece. Moreover, availability of sacks is also an issue as most of the outlets are closed due to the lockdown.

Usually, the arrival of onions at Lasalgaon is between 15,000 and 20,000 quintal per day. However, on Friday only 230 quintal of onions were auctioned.

“Availability of workers is a major issue. Traders are not getting workers for loading, unloading, weighing, grading and packaging of onions. Due to this, market had to cbe losed on Thursday,” an APMC official said.

“We had convinced traders to start onion auction in the interest of farmers. Following discussion with traders, it was decided to conduct onion auction in sacks,” the official added.

The average wholesale onion price at Lasalgaon on Friday was recorded at Rs 1,600 per quintal as against Rs 1,250 per quintal on Monday. The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices were recorded at Rs 700 and Rs 1,680 per quintal, respectively.

“This has caused another burden on farmers as they will have to bear expenses for buying sacks. Hence, only loose auction of onions should be held,” Prakash Magar , an onion farmer, said.

PUNE: The district administration on Friday issued a notification warning health workers of severe punishment if found shunning their crucial duties at private or government-run hospital in Pune.

The notification has been issued in the wake of the fear among health workers about contracting the Covid-19 infection. This has prompted many to stay away from work, causing reduction in their numbers at hospitals treating Covid-19 patients and other small nursing homes and clinics .

Bharati hospital has reported about 60% reduction in their paramedic force after an admitted woman tested positive for Covid-19. “We will initiate action against the erring doctors eschewing duty for violations of the norms of Disaster Management Act 2005, Maharashtra Covid-19 Containment Rules 2020 and Epidemic Act, 1897 already effective in Pune and adjoining areas,” divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar stated in the notification issued on March 26.

Eye surgeon Sanjay Patil, the president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Pune branch, said, “For medical staffers not reporting to duty at private hospitals, there are certain issues that need to be sorted. First lockdown has made the commute difficult for the medical staffers mainly paramedics. Again, there is a severe shortage of personal protective equipment in terms of masks and other gears for health workers.”

A doctor from Bharati hospital said, “As soon as the news about our hospital treating Covid-19 positive patient came out, almost 40% of nursing staffers have stopped reporting to work at Bharati hospital. More than the staff, their families are refusing to send them to duties fearing they will contract the contagion. Many of them have left for their native places.”

“Adding to the woes, our hospital canteen workers have fled and many dubbawalas are unable to supply tiffins to resident doctors. With the help of catering firm, we have now started providing meals to around 250 residents doctors at our hospital. Besides, we are also regularly holding their counselling sessions,” the doctor said.

Siwan DM Amit Pandey said, “A three kilometre radius around the residence of the Covid-19 positive person who had returned from Dubai on March 21 has been quarantined. His 13 immediate family members have been shifted to the isolation ward of Maharajganj sub-divisional hospital and their samples will be sent for the test.”

This man had reached Nautan block in Siwan on March 21 via roadways from Lucknow. “On March 23, our team had gone for random checking to collect details of all those who had come from outside Bihar. That day, we met him and got his details, however he was asymptomatic. On March 25 he himself reported to us after feeling uneasy and was referred to NMCH,” Pandey said.

He added that this Dubai-returned man had been following all quarantine protocols and had not met anyone outside his family.

The Nalanda resident who was also confirmed positive for Covid-19 virus on Friday has no travel history. However, he was working at a private hospital on Bypass Road, where a Covid-19 positive Munger native, who died on Saturday, had gone for treatment.

On Thursday, a ward boy of that hospital had tested positive, after which the district administration got it sealed. Patna DM Kumar Ravi said, “The hospital is now being disinfected and all staff have been quarantined. He said even family members of those staff who have been found Covid-19 positive will be tested.”

378,['28/03/2020'],Villagers show Bhubaneswar the way in maintaining hygiene,"BHUBANESWAR/ANGUL: While police have to be on their toes to ensure that lockdown is clamped in cities, villages have taken in up themselves to restrict the entry of outsiders into their areas, all in a bid to stop the unkown enemy — the novel coronavirus.

The educated and urban city dwellers may not always maintain the desired hygiene level in this hour of crisis, but the residents of remote villages in Balangir and Subarnapur districts are setting an example by ensuring the same without waiting for the police and district administration officials.

As one were to enter these villages, one will find check-gates like the ones set up in an army base. There are villagers manning these gates on shifts and they make sure that no outsider enters their area. Even the villagers who return from a vegetable market have to explain as to where they had gone and who all they met. After they are allowed in, they are offered soap and water that has been kept in a bucket for washing hands.

“Be it Jarasingha or Gaibahal villagees in Balangir district and Binka and Khaliapali villages in Subarnaapur district , the villagers have made it a point to screen people and then let them in. Initially, it was not easy to implement it. Many villagers would find it odd to get screened. For them, it was also odd to wash hands and enter the village. But the appeal of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Naveeen Patnaik worked to a great extent,” said Jarasingha Sarpanch Kushadhwaja Meher

The villages, which now look deserted, inspired the neighbouring ones to implement similar restrictions. “The good thing is that the villagers have realized the magnitude of the problem and become self-motivated. We just had to make the logistics available for them so that they could implement the rules,” said Kanha Mishra, a resident of Binka.

Khaliapali village, which is known as the birthplace of saint poet Bhima Bhoi, now doesn’t allow any stranger to enter the village. The famous village usually witnesses tourists thronging to the religious site round the year. All the tourists coming in car or motorcycles are being asked to go back. The restriction will continue till middle of April. “If there is a need to extend it further, we will do so,” said Satyanarayna Pujhari, a villager. The villagers have collected money to buy soaps. At many places, the panchayats have taken initiative to provide the hand soap and bucket to store water.

Youths of Thakurgarh and Ranibandha villages in Angul district are allowing people into their villages only after proper investigation to prevent the spread of Covid-19. They have also put up a board, “Covid-19 Awareness. Entry restricted” at the entry to the villages.

PUNE: Shelves and aisles across multiple grocery stores and super markets in the city have run dry amid lack of fresh supply in the wake of the 21-day nationwide lockdown triggered by the Covid-19 spread.

Wanowrie resident Sakshi Jain said, “I had stepped out to buy some groceries on Friday. The fruit section of the grocery shop I visited was shut. Vegetables were available but were of poor quality. Coffee powder wasn’t available either. I tried to visit other stores as well but the entire market, including grocery stores, is shut at Jagtap Chowk.”

Similar was the case on Satara Road. “Several food products are not available in the Satara Road area. Even to get milk, one needs to step out either very early in the morning or late in the evening,” Purva Sankhla, a resident of Satara Road, rued.

NIBM Road, Kondhwa and their surrounding areas are among the worst affected, with shelves at most shops almost bare. Residents from the area said there was a shortage of milk powder, butter, cooking oil, biscuits, pulses and grains.

According to the owner of Chandradeep Stores, Ramesh Rathod , noodles, tetrapak milk, packaged frozen chicken, dry snacks, flour, honey, disinfectants and other cleaning agents have almost disappeared from shop shelves in several parts of the city. “Many brands selling these products have warehouses in Pune, but the stock is not reaching shops due to logistical issues and staff crunch,” he said.

Distributor of FMCG products Sham Mundada said, “Stocks of several items across the city have started depleting. We are still trying to figure a way to resume operations.”

PUNE: In the four days since the Pune police released four WhatsApp numbers for citizens’ enquiries, the SEVA cell has fielded more than 34,000 requests.

The four numbers are being operated by 12 police officers and constables round the clock, who deal with various requests for permission to commute in case of an exigency, or various enquiries related to the Covid-19 lockdown.

Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Bachchan Singh said they were issuing permissions only for valid requests from the jurisdiction of the Pune police. “We are issuing digital permissions to those who need to visit hospitals, etc. Some people message for trivial things, which are being denied categorically. Similarly, people from areas outside Pune police jurisdiction, like Pimpri Chinchwad and rural Pune, also send messages, but we don’t respond to those,” Singh said.

“Each WhatsApp number is monitored by a group of four constables,” inspector Shilpa Chavan of the SEVA cell told TOI. “This allows them some respite, as messages pour in every minute. We have responded to 80% of the messages by granting or denying permission on a case-by-case basis. We don’t respond to trivial requests,” Chavan added.

She said most of the requests are for those seeking to go to the hospital or buy medication. “People suffering from cancer, heart ailments or other serious problems get permission in a minute,” she said.

Chavan said special attention is given to elderly couples or senior citizens live alone. “In such cases, We have asked the local police stations to help them out by fetching essentials or medicines. We have also issued permissions for the movement of elderly citizens’ home nursing attendants,” she said.

The WhatsApp numbers have also received requests from students staying in hostels, seeking help to get food, permission to go to the mess or any place they can get food.

“However, there are also annoying messages, such as where one can find vegetables, groceries and other items, or seeking permission to go to petrol pumps. We ignore all such messages,” Chavan said.

Initially, the constables had used response templates to reply to the requests. But soon, it took too much time and the volume of messages pouring in just increased. So they resorted to replying with just “yes” or “no”, as the case may be. One constable said messages arrive in such large numbers that it sometimes becomes difficult to respond to them all quickly. “We use the laid-down norms and our reasoning to permit people to venture out onto the streets,” he said.

Where, necessary, some requests not covered by the norms are also granted on humanitarian grounds.

A woman constable said, “There was no provision in the earlier rules for animal-feeding. And we received many messages from people from across the city, seeking permission to go out and feed stray cats or dogs. We gave them permission.”

The flow of messages never lets up, the constables said. “If we take even a little time off to drink water or use the washroom, about 500-1,000 messages pile up,” a constable said.

PUNE: The Pimpri Chinchwad police on Friday decided to conduct an inquiry into the allegations levelled by an ambulance driver about police high-handedness at the Urse toll post while carrying a patient and his relatives from Mumbai to Ahmednagar, leading to his father’s death.

The inquiry would be conducted based on a video showing the driver narrating the alleged police excesses that has been brought to the notice of the police higher-ups and the fact that a case of accidental death was registered by the Shikrapur police.

Pimpri Chinchwad’s additional commissioner of police Ramnath Pokale said, “We have received information about the matter. We shall inquire into the allegations. To ascertain the exact cause of death, we are waiting for the post-mortem report.”

As of now, apart from the accidental death, no FIR has been registered. Nor the ambulance driver has lodged a written complaint. The post-mortem was to be conducted at the Sassoon General Hospital on Friday night.

In the video, the ambulance driver, Nilesh Shinde, claimed that the police stopped his vehicle at the Urse toll post around 12.30pm on the suspicion that he was ferrying passengers. Shinde claimed that he and his father Naresh Shinde (49), sitting in the passenger’s seat next to him, told the police that they were carrying a patient and his relatives from Mumbai to Ahmednagar, but the policemen did not listen to them.

Shinde claimed that while he and his father were pleading the policemen to let them go, one of the policemen abused him, while another hit his father with a stick. He claimed in the video that the police asked him to pay Rs5,000 but later allowed them to go after taking Rs 3,000.

“After driving about 15km from Urse, my father suddenly fell unconscious. I took him to few hospitals nearby. But no one admitted him. At last, a private hospital in Shikrapur allowed us in. But doctors declared my father dead on arrival,” Shinde said.

He claimed that had hospitals near Chakan treated his father, the latter could have been saved.

Shikrapur police inspector Sadashiv Shelar said, “We have registered a case of accidental death and sent it to the Shirgaon police under the Pimpri Chinchwad commissionerate for further probe. It was not clear if there were patients in the ambulance.”

With only those employed in essential services or facing emergencies allowed to commute on city roads and highways during the lockdown, state governments are struggling to find the best mechanism to ensure this. From the experience so far, it looks like issuing and using e-passes are simpler than physical passes. Also, decentralising the issuing process as much as possible appears to be the way forward. Another simple way is to focus on ID cards issued by respective organisations.

E-passes

Delhi has introduced e-passes for those involved in the manufacture, transport, and storage of essential items. Requests can also be made on phone. Though 10,000 e-passes have been issued in the last two days, 50,000 are still pending, so huge is the demand. Karnataka has decided to go for e-passes after first introducing physical passes that clogged the system. Haryana has an online application process for emergency passes during the lockdown.

Coronavirus lockdown: Latest updates

Company ID cards/uniforms

In Kerala and West Bengal , ID cards issued by respective organisations are accepted from those who are part of essential services. In Hyderabad, delivery boys need only to wear their uniforms. Other than them, those in essential services need to mail their names after which authorities examine and issue physical passes.

Kerala also has self-declaration forms for emergencies like hospital visits, but they were initially misused.

Physical passes

Almost all other states and UTs use this. Punjab , Haryana (those who cannot use an e-pass) and Karnataka gave the responsibility of issuing passes to deputy commissioners. It proved chaotic everywhere. In Mohali, the authorities ran out of printed slips in a day. Across Punjab, different DCs are handling it in different ways, leading to further chaos.

In Mumbai, the system of physical passes is working well. In Nagpur, as of Thursday, 13,500 passes were issued from different police stations.

In Tamil Nadu , ID cards will be issued to those moving essential commodities and to farmers by district collectors. The process has just begun. Vehicles will also need a self-declaration sticker. In UP, district administration officials are issuing passes to essential staff and farmers.

In MP, passes are being issued by local police stations. In Jabalpur, passes were initially issued through the district collectorate, but the rush was such that it was handed down to the local police stations.

PUNE: A number of citizens across Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad are providing food, water and other essentials to policemen manning the roads. Food packets, dry snacks and water are being distributed among on-duty policemen at checkpoints, chowkies and police stations.

Jai Ganesh Group from Kachi Ali in Guruwar Peth has been serving breakfast to policemen in and around Swargate for the last 4-5 days. “Our wives cook the food at home and we go out to deliver. Six of us go to deliver on different days in rotation. So far, we have prepared and served poha, idli sambar, upma, and other snacks. We have sought permission from the police to distribute food between 8.30am and 12.30pm,” said Chetan Lodha .

Lodha added that the initiative took root because the group wanted to do something for the police. “After serving the police, if we have any food leftover, we serve it with tea to employees of petrol pumps and street dwellers,” he added.

Apulki Group from Sinhagad Road has also been engaged in delivering snacks and water to the police personnel on duty. “The police personnel are standing at assigned checkpoints for a long duration. They hardly go home. While they do carry tiffin, if they get hungry again, they may have nothing to eat. We are distributing dry snacks like chakli, chivda, shankarpali, biscuits, wafers, pedha, barfi, chikki, and many other items, among the personnel,” explained Sameer Rupade , coordinator of Apulki Group.

The group delivers the eatables to 12 checkpoints, three police chowkies and one police station along Sinhagad Road. “We have been distributing the snacks for three days.

399,['28/03/2020'],Sanskruti Foundation dreams of beggar and ‘beghar’ free Nagpur,"Nagpur: ‘Let’s go home, this is not where you belong.’ These words, uttered each time by Sakshi Kshirsagar, a criminal lawyer, whenever she finds a beggar or homeless person on the streets of city spell hope. In the shelter home run by her ‘Sanskruti Foundation’, these homeless people not only get a roof, food and water, but also love, care and humanity.

A dream come true, is what Kshirsagar says of her work as she recalls how she began her journey. She used to see beggars, especially the elderly ones, begging in the scorching heat of Nagpur and her heart would break. She eventually decided to invest all her hard work and passion in creating ‘Sanskruti Foundation’.

“Whenever I saw beggars on road, I would feel guilty at not being able to help them. While I was completing my law studies, I promised myself I will make a home for them with the little resources that I have,” said Kshirsagar.

It started in 2012. She had a small place where they used to run the ‘Home’ as she calls it, in Sitabuldi for five years. Her vision has always been clear, ‘End homelessness’. This foundation is transforming the life of homeless by resolving problems in their life and bring them into mainstream of society.

After endless struggle of finding a proper place that will feel like home, in 2017, the Foundation got a closed NMC school and Urban Homeless Shelter Home at Hansapuri Primary School for Nagpur City Homeless and Distressed People was born.

Nitesh Nagdeve joined hands with Kshirsagar as manager of the Foundation and has been its pillar since then. He has contributed in searching, convincing, and bringing these beggars to the foundation for over three years now. “It was never easy. Talking to beggars and helping them has always given me a sense of satisfaction. We strive hard to get their identity, hunt jobs for them and take care of their basic needs,” said Nagdeve.

The foundation has benefited over 347 homeless people. Also employment was provided to 48. They were also enrolled in social benefit schemes, given de-addiction treatment, education, skills and medical treatment. Kshirsagar aims to make Nagpur a “Beghar Free” city.

“As our city is developing each day, the homeless, distressed and beggar population needs attention. No homeless should ever be found in a developed city,” she said.

Kshirsagar’s study and knowledge of law helped her. She said it is very difficult to convince the homeless that they have come to help. “We have to show them pictures and proof that we can help them live a better life. Recently, we rescued an old man and gave him a haircut and a bath. He looked so happy. That’s my reward,” said Kshirsagar.

“Most homeless have skin allergies and live in poor condition. It is a very sorry sight. We do our best with them,” Nagdeve said.

The Foundation also provides free food for senior citizens and children above 14. It has TV, lockers, 100-bed facility . They take the inmates for movies and also try to find their families and identity, which is a tough job. “A study says more than 80% are addicted to alcohol, ganja, bidi , and tobacco chewing etc. So, we tied up with a de-addiction centre and are treating them,” said Kshirsagar.

Asked where she wants to see this foundation in future, she said, “I want my city to be beggar free. I will always work for these people, who have no family. I want to become their family and one day surely there will be no beggars and homeless people on our streets.”

We had accordingly decided to carry out the process from April 15 to May 31. At the moment, it is not possible to conduct the training programme for the officials. Instructions have been given accordingly,” said a senior revenue department official.

PUNE: Cashing in on 50% short supply, some unscrupulous elements are selling vegetables in the city at sky-high prices.

A resident tweeted on Friday, “A shop in Magarpatta City Pune is charging Rs300 for chilli. The vegetables are being sold at whatever the amount they (traders) want.”

The vegetable market in Gultekdi and the Shivaji market in Camp are shut at present. Retailers claimed that the supply of a bulk of vegetables like tomatoes, cauliflower and okra, which come from outside, were restricted because drivers transporting them did not have identity cards (ID) proving that they were a part of essential services. Against this backdrop, unauthorized sellers are thriving and selling vegetables at whatever price they wish.

A resident tweeted, “I have no fuel left in my scooter and so can’t even go to buy groceries and essentials. My local area shop is empty of rations and vegetables. Can I please get some fuel pass or grocery/veggies to my home in Gujarwadi?”

On Friday, some retail vegetable shops in Shivajingar sold onions at Rs70 per kg as against the price of Rs30 per kg three days ago. Tomatoes were sold at Rs80 per kg as against the price of Rs40 per kg three days ago.

Shankar Surve, a retailer in Shivaji market, Camp, said, “Vegetables are in short supply as a lot of transporters and sellers have not been able to procure the ‘essential services’ sticker for vehicles. The number of farmers getting the produce to the Gultekdi market is low because of police checks and lack of stickers or tags to move about unhindered for supplying essential goods like vegetables.”

Surve said the unwillingness of traders and sellers of Market Yard to resume operations before the month-end was worsening the situation. “Vegetables are only coming into the market from nearby places. Vegetables like tomatoes, cauliflower (comes from as far as Satara) okra and cabbage are thus in short supply. Shivaji market is closed right now but illegal sellers have started selling vegetables at a high price outside the market,” he said.

“Some vendors were selling chillies at Rs250 per kg outside Shivaji market on Friday morning,” he said.

Vitthal Hanamgar, another retailer on NIBM Road, said vegetables were over 80% short and the prices in the past few days had gone up by 25-30%. “My shop was closed last two days but on Friday, we managed to get some supplies from farmers directly,” he said.

Sunil Kumbharkar, the owner of a vegetable wholesale firm in Market Yard, said, “Truck loaders who get the produce from farmers to retail markets in Pune also need to get essential services tag from the police. Unless they get these tags, their movement will be restricted, and the supplies will remain low,” he said.

An official from Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Pune said despite the Gultekdi Market being closed, a total of 120 trucks of vegetables (brought by farmers directly) came on Friday. “More supplies will come to Gultekdi from farmers on Sunday, as per our appeal to them. The traders and sellers of the market will resume operations from April 1,” he said.

The assertion came in the context of India's reiteration of support to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BWC) on the 45th anniversary of its coming into force.

""India reiterates the high importance that it has always attached to the BWC as the first global and non- discriminatory disarmament Convention, prohibiting an entire category of weapons of mass destruction. We give a high priority to its universalisation and full and effective implementation by all States Parties to it,"" said the government in a statement.

On the economic implications of Covid-19, the government said these had highlighted the need for strengthening cooperation amongst the ""States Parties"" to the BWC aimed at full and effective implementation of the Convention in all its aspects.

""India has been working with fellow ‘States Parties’ to establish an Article VII database which can play an important role in dealing with bio-threats and bio-emergencies,"" it said.

""As we approach the 9th Review Conference of the Convention in 2021, we reiterate our call for institutional strengthening of the Convention, including negotiation of a comprehensive and legally binding Protocol, providing for an effective, universal and non-discriminatory verification mechanism to strengthen the implementation of the Convention by ‘States Parties’, ensuring full compliance and deterring non-compliance with it,"" said the government.

India strongly believes, said the government, that the BWC must respond effectively to the challenges posed by the new and emerging scientific and technological developments of relevance to the Convention. India has been submitting an annual Resolution at the UN General Assembly on the ""Role of science and technology in the context of international security and disarmament”, which has been adopted by consensus.

""India has also been highlighting the dangers from the possible use, in future, of micro-organisms as biological weapons by terrorists through its annual Resolution at the UN General Assembly, titled ‘Measures to prevent terrorists from acquiring the weapons of mass destruction’, which has been adopted, annually since 2002, by consensus,"" it said.

They were left with little money and no shelter.Konkan divisional commissioner Shivajirao Daund said preliminary reports indicated about 11,000 people were stranded at 67 locations in the seven districts of the coastal region of the state.Palghar had 1,700 stranded people, Thane 2,000, Mumbai district 3,000, Mumbai suburban district 2,000, and Raigad 2,000. Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg had the remaining few hundred. “We will provide them dry ration or cooked food and temporary shelter. We will ensure every stranded person gets food and shelter. Officials of the revenue department are working at the grass-root level to locate stranded people,” Daund said.Jalgaon collector Avinash Dhakne said besides employees of the revenue and other departments, he has roped in NGOs to provide food and shelter. “As of now, we have made arrangements for 5,000 stranded persons. Their arrangement has been made at mangal karyalayas (marriage halls) in the district. We are following social distancing norms. If more persons are located, we can make arrangements for them too,” Dhakne said.Akola collector Jeetendra Papalkar said the district administration had made arrangements for 500 persons. “We have made arrangements in municipal schools. Cooked food is from local NGOs. All officials have been asked to ensure no stranded person remains without food and shelter,” Papalkar said.A bureaucrat said the Centre had directed the state to make arrangements for the estimated one lakh stranded people.

Rajkot: Rajkot police commissioner Manoj Agrawal on Friday issued an order to all builders and factory owners to prevent migrant labourers working in their units from leaving the city.

The order was issued after thousands of labourers were seen returning to their natives on foot, leaving the city. “If a labourer is COVID-19 positive, he is likely to infect many others in his village when he reaches there. Keeping this in mind, the commissioner has issued the order,” said Agrawal.

Most of the migrant labourers working in Rajkot city and district are from Dahod, Godhra, Chhota Udepur and Jhabua and Alirajpur of Madhya Pradesh.

Agrawal told reporters: “The builders and factory owners have been asked to provide their labourers free food, boarding and lodging. If any builder or a factory owner is unable to do so, he may contact NGOs to provide the facilities. There are several NGOs in the city providing free food and other essential. If it is found that any builder or factory owner has asked his labourers to leave the city, he will be booked for the violation of the government’s lockdown order.”

For the citizens of Rajkot, the commissioner said that arrangements had been made to provide all essential commodities including vegetables, milk and grocery items at their doorsteps. “We have made public the list of medical store owners with their cellphone numbers who can provide medicines at the doorsteps of the citizens when called up,” said Agrawal.

“Apart from the vehicles of the government officials and the members of NGOs providing relief materials to the citizens, no vehicle will be permitted to ply on the roads,” the commissioner added.

Balram Meena, superintendent of police, Rajkot rural, has also issued a similar order to all the builders and factory owners of Rajkot district.

On Friday, thousands of migrant labourers were stopped leaving the city by the police at Greenland Chowkdi, Madhapar Chowkdi, Raiya Chowkdi, Gondal Road Chowkdi and Maliyasan. They were provided with meals and made to return to their sites and factories.

On Thursday, 1,000-odd labourers were seen on the roads in the city. They were caught and made to return to their respective sites and factories.

INDORE/RAIPUR: With the Covid-19 outbreak showing no sign of abating, the Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh governments have invoked a British-era law to acquire private hospitals to battle the pandemic. The Indore administration took over two such hospitals on Friday. The commercial hub accounts for nearly half of the state’s 29 cases and one of two deaths.

“On the orders of collector Lokesh Kumar Jatav, Gokuldas Hospital and Vishesh Hospital have been acquired for treatment of Covid-19 infected patients,” said Indore chief medical officer Dr Pravin Jadia, adding that this was done under Epidemic Diseases Act 1897. The law was enacted on February 4, 1897, to battle a bubonic plague outbreak in Mumbai.

“We have a 60-bed treatment facility in state-run MRTB Hospital and a 150-bed quarantine in Jagadguru Dattatreya Hospital. The 450-bed MTH Hospital is being used as an isolation facility,” said the CMHO, adding that 18 private hospitals have been authorised to treat the disease.

“There is a difference between ‘authorising’ and ‘acquiring’ a private hospital for treatment of a disease. Private hospitals acquired by the administration will be dedicated only for treatment of a particular disease while authorised hospitals can treat other patients along with those of Covid-19,” explained Dr Jadia.

424,['28/03/2020'],India Coronavirus news: 15 lakh who flew back to India between Jan 18-Mar 23 under lens,"NEW DELHI: Some 15 lakh people who returned to India between January 18 and March 23, when the complete ban on international arrivals kicked in, are at the centre of an intense scrutiny to ensure they do not become Covid-19 transmitters with the cabinet secretary writing to states and asking them to track individuals who have not been accounted for in the screening-quarantine surveillance process.Many of these people are part of home or institutional quarantine programmes launched for foreign travellers but officials said there were “some gaps” and states have been asked to track missing links as international travel has been the key link to Covid-19 cases. Some of these individuals would have completed 14 days after arrival and are now safe. There are others who can be potential spreaders and need scrutiny.Underlining a discrepancy between arrivals and those accounted for in surveillance, cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba said the MHA ’s Bureau of Immigration had “shared details of over 15 lakh incoming international passengers with states for monitoring for Covid-19”, whereas lesser number of people were being monitored.The MHA’s Bureau of Immigration had “shared details of over 15 lakh incoming international passengers with states for monitoring for Covid-19”, whereas lesser number of people were being monitored. “It is important that they are put under close surveillance to prevent the spread of the epidemic,” the letter said.“We are keeping an eagle’s eye on the arrivals, particularly those who came to India in March,” a government source said. Those who reached India need to be on the integrated disease surveillance programme so that authorities are assured that they are out of the danger zone. The Centre has asked states to immediately step up surveillance and trace all these travellers seen as crucial to breaking the chain of transmission.Highlighting “gaps” in the numbers of passengers who should have been monitored and the actual count, Gauba asked states to immediately identify all such travellers and put them under close surveillance to prevent the spread of the epidemic. As a key preventive measure against Covid-19 which has spread in over 170 countries so far, the Centre started monitoring all international passengers who arrived in India in the last two months to ensure carriers of the virus could be isolated and treated in quarantine.“I do not think it needs any evidence that we started way early. We still do not have community transmission,” Dr R R Gangakhedkar, head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said, hinting at measures such as isolation, social distancing and testing undertaken by the government at a war footing so far.Till Friday, 724 positive cases of Covid-19 were reported by the health ministry with 75 new cases and four deaths reported in the last 24 hours. Of this, 640 were active cases, whereas 66 were cured and one migrated. Total deaths stood at 77.Health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said Gauba’s letter was part of a routine communication and orientation with states to ensure collective efforts were made to monitor all international passengers. Gauba said in his letter that this wasn’t the first time that the Centre had reminded states about the need to keep a close watch on Indians and foreigners with a travel history. The health ministry has sent repeated messages to states to step up surveillance.“I understand that the ministry of health has repeatedly emphasised this and requested the states and UTs to take immediate steps in this regard. I would therefore like to request to ensure that concerted and sustained action is taken urgently to put such passengers under surveillance immediately as per MOHFW guidelines,” Gauba’s letter said.Meanwhile, the government is also making efforts to procure more ventilators, personal protection equipment (PPEs) and masks. Agarwal said an order for 30,000 ventilators had been placed with Bharat Electronics Limited and another 10,000 with a public sector company.The health ministry has also started training of doctors and healthcare workers so that a uniform treatment protocol can be followed across the country.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74855582,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-403860,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/15-lakh-who-flew-back-to-india-between-jan-18-mar-23-under-lens/articleshow/74855553.cms
425,['28/03/2020'],"Lockdown: Citizens take liberties, police rest lathis","Nagpur: After cops decided not to use force, Nagpurians seem to have taken to venturing out of their homes on various pretexts, ignoring the national lockdown for the Covid-19 crisis. On Friday, roads, despite generally wearing a deserted look, saw a lot of movement of citizens and vehicles.

Police maintained a strict checking schedule on the main corridors and junctions across the city. The enforcement of section 144 appeared to be somewhat fruitful, with motorists, bikers, cyclists and pedestrians required to furnish concrete reasons or produce passes procured from police stations to continue their journey in west Nagpur.

In stark contrast, the lanes in east and north-east Nagpur, like Kalamna, Pardi, Hiwri Nagar, Nandanvan, Quetta Colony and such places, were busy with humans and vehicles moving about almost at will. Despite police presence to enforce lockdown, there was even a murder at Itabhatti in Yashodhara Nagar slums in broad daylight. Sources stated gambling and bootlegging also continues in these slums.

Even in the slums and localities of Ganeshpeth, public continued to throng lanes and gathered at different places ignoring the social distancing norms.

On the streets, especially those leading to the national highways to Madhya Pradesh and other state highways leading to other districts, groups of labourers, along with their families, were spotted moving on foot. All of them are trying to return to their native places in the absence of any vehicles. Several such groups of labourers on their way to Seoni in MP on foot were helped by residents of Goa Colony near Gaddigodam .

Mayor Sandip Joshi expressed shock at the manner in which the people in colonies and slums are ignoring repeated appeals to stay in their homes and avoid gatherings. “I have decided to go around personally making announcements through public address system in the lanes and localities to abstain from gathering on the road,” he said.

The mayor also said he would take up the issue with city police chief BK Upadhyay . “People in the lanes and smaller localities are paying no heed to the social distancing issue, risking community infection,” said the mayor.

Upadhyay, admitting that too many people are on the road, said it is not possible to confine citizens inside house as it may have adverse effects too. “We have to allow space for workers of essential and emergency services to operate, so that these services are not disturbed. Still, we are making efforts to stop people from loitering aimlessly,” he said.

City police on Friday detained 73 violators, registered offences against four, and issued passes to 3,590 persons for emergency exemptions.

A 38-year-old man, Nilesh Bhati, was arrested by Ramtek police of Nagpur Rural for allegedly posting a remark on his social media stating that citizens can step outside their houses without any fear of corona infection as the virus does not sustain in high temperatures. An offence was registered against Bhati, a resident of Rajaji Ward, following a complaint by the tehsildar of Ramtek.

The Electrical Consumers Industrial Organizations State Level Coordination Committee (ECIO-CC) has written a letter to Thackeray in this regard.

Committee convener Pratap Hogade has stated that all the industrial units in the state were closed for an indefinite period, and hence appropriate directions should be issued to MSEDCL and other distribution licensees by the government.

Hogade has demanded that charges for the lockdown period should be totally waived. The other demands include load factor incentive should be calculated excluding the lockdown period. Energy charges should be charged on the basis of actual consumption units. Average bills may be issued only in case of non-availability of meter readings. Such bills should be appropriately corrected after getting meter readings of the concerned consumers.

March, April and May bills payment period should be extended up to June 30 without any interest or delayed payment charges. Power factor penalty should be waived for the lockdown period.

All these measures should be applicable to all other consumers categories for example poultry, cold storage etc.

Vidarbha Taxpayers Association (VTA) has also written to energy minister Nitin Raut to defer electricity bill payment by few months, likewise net metering accumulated units be carried forward to the next year and requested for reduction of electricity tariff taking into consideration the Covid-19 restrictions.

Shrawankumar Malu, president of VTA, requested that electricity bill payments of all consumers may be deferred for a few months, moreover penalty and interest for such extended period may also be waived off. Every citizen is confined at their residence without any source of earning and thereby facing difficulty in payment of their electricity bills.

Tejinder Singh Renu, VTA secretary, requested that every year end the generated and accumulated solar units are cleared off by the MSEDCL by crediting meagre amount per unit to such consumer, thereby restarting solar production from April 1. They have requested that the solar units accumulated be carried forward to the next year so that its true benefit reaches the consumers and the environment also benefits.

Meanwhile, Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) has issued directives to all distribution licensees in the state to not send their staff to take meter readings or distribute power bills.

THANE: A 39-year-old carpenter who lost his mother in Rajasthan was allegedly assaulted by the Gujarat police late on Wednesday when he tried to reach his village to perform her last rites. He said he had obtained the necessary permission to travel from the police in Thane.

Bhairulal Lohar, who lives in Savarkar Nagar here, said that while the Gujarat police turned him back, the police back here in the state were not allowing him to leave on Friday despite his being in possession of the relevant permission letter from the Vartak Nagar police station. He said he had obtained the permission after showing the death certificate copy, which he had obtained from relatives in his native village.

Lohar said his father had passed away long ago. He said his mother, who lived in Rajasmand district, passed away on Wednesday. He said his relatives, with the help of a local Shiv Sena functionary, got them an ambulance run by Shiv Sena minister Eknath Shinde.

""We did not have any problem in Maharashtra, but as we came to a toll naka 13 kms farther from Talasari, Gujarat policemen caned the driver without asking anything,"" he said. ""When I showed them the death certificate printout which I got on WhatsApp , they tore it apart and did not allow us to go ahead despite my pleading with them many times.""

Lohar said he showed proof, including video evidence, of his mother's demise, but the Gujarat police would listen to nothing and even smashed his phone.

He, along with his wife Jayashree , has retrieved more than 2,000 bodies and saved another 1,000 from ending their life.

The ongoing national lockdown has made the Khare couple switch their philanthropic attention from water to land.

Every day now, the Khare couple and their friends from Kashibai dewul neighbourhood near Ashok Chowk go around feeding around 1,000-1,200 street dwellers and other helpless persons with community contribution. They pick out the worst sufferers of the lockdown who are finding it tough to eat with hotels shut. Even the roadside tea and food vendors’ kiosks have been shut leading to acute food scarcity for the people who stay on the streets and depend on alms.

Jagdish, who had purchased an ambulance with cash award of Rs 5 lakh he received from Bollywood star Akshay Kumar, has now started using the vehicle for distributing ‘masale bhat’ or vegetable fried rice with the help of his neighbours. Some of his neighbors accompany him on their bikes. “There are beggars at the temple gates but now with temples closed they too don’t have anything,” said Jayashree whose earns livelihood by cleaning and sweeping the Sitabuldi police station.

Jagdish explained that he, Jayashree and others had realized after the lockdown that the street dwellers, alms-seekers, and others stranded without transport were likely to be facing food crisis. “Our views were supported by the like-minded persons from the neighbourhood who contributed in cash and kind,” said Jagdish. “Even the person who cooks the rice has come forward to sponsor the scheme on alternate days,” he said.

Jagdish said the food is prepared by 2 pm with the help of neighbours and distribution starts thereafter. “We do not take food to a police station or a chowk and complete the formality by clicking picture. Every day, we have been moving around in more than 10-12 km radius looking for needy people on the streets,” said Jagdish who earns by providing cleaning and sanitation at the Ganeshpeth police station.

The six-decade old trade body wrote a letter to union minister of state of shipping Mansukh Mandaviya stating the problem due to the continued operation during this lockdown period.

Force majeure absolves companies from meeting their contractual obligations for reasons beyond their control.

The custom house agents are required to file the shipping bills and need to do other necessary documentation by sitting their office, but they are not allowed to open the office and call the staff.

GCCI secretary Aashish Joshi said, “We are supporting the lockdown, but there are severe problems because of port being operational. We are unable to load and unload cargo at specific time and as a result we have to pay the demurrage. We want port to declare force majeure so that we don’t have to pay demurrage or penalty.”

In the long run, it also helps understand its evolutionary relationship with other viruses. In this sample, two structural features specific to the novel coronavirus were observed.When compared to other human viruses and coronaviruses, the report said, this sample had a shorter envelope (within which lies a long strand of RNA genome), at about 15 nanometre. However, that can be confirmed only when a sample is taken from a cell culture, it added.The other feature was that peplomers, spike proteins on its surface that give it the name ‘coronavirus’ because of the crown-like structure, were found to have aggregated. In the common flu virus, these appear triangular in shape. Five distinct peplomers were imaged and a ‘stalk’ connecting the peplomer to the surface of the virus. The spikes are how the virus latch on to human cells and enter them. Further studies into the structure of the stalk could help understand the genomic structure of the virus.The technique they used, electron microscopy, had been used by Hong Kong researchers to study the structure of the virus. “No detailed studies on ultrastructural cytopathology are available till date,” the paper said.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74856079,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-112990,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indias-1st-corona-images-show-its-round-with-cobbled-surface/articleshow/74856081.cms

Between Tuesday and Friday, city police have issued around 16 ,554 passes to citizens who want to move out.

A senior cop told TOI that as per the order passes are being issued to citizens who provide a valid reason, and belong to essential services like government jobs, MSEB, doctors or medical institutions.

Meanwhile, on Friday, police detained 73 persons wandering about the city without a proper reason or police pass.

There have also been instances where people approached police stations to get passes to travel from one place to another to deliver money to workers. “A contractor wanted to give money to his workers, and they needed it due to the current lockdown. So, we issued a one-day pass to the contractor,” said a cop at Sitabuldi police station.

“We are also trying to ensure photos of the pass holder on the pass, so that it cannot be misused,” the cop added.

However, the system of photos on passes seems to be limited to some police station, as some of them are only giving stamps and reason on the pass/letter.

It is learnt that currently police officials are issuing one-day pass as well as long term passes, as per the demands of citizens and their reasons.

Prasad Pophali, owner of a tiffin delivery venture, said, “We are currently supplying lunch and dinner dabbas to around 300 people across the city. It was essential for me to get the pass as many from outside the city are dependent solely on my tiffins. So, we applied at the office of additional commissioner of police (crime) Nilesh Bharne, listing the food delivery locations, names and vehicle numbers of all our employees.”

Pophali received an approval letter the next day, giving his delivery team the permission to operate in the specified areas till March 31. “We will subsequently apply for renewal of the pass so that our services continue uninterrupted,” he added.

A senior cop clarified that the delivery boys appointed by online food delivery portals do not need a police pass to deliver orders. “Since the delivery of food is allowed, the delivery boys do not need a police pass to travel in city. The delivery boys must wear clothes from their company and carry a valid identity card provided by the company. They must also give valid reason after being stopped during nakabandi,” said the cop.

Till now no request for passes has been rejected, said cops. However, some people have been asked to visit police stations near their locality to get passes.

436,['28/03/2020'],Competitive exams: Delay may give students edge,"Nagpur: The delay in competitive exams may have just given an edge to students with the extra time on their hands to prepare for it. Due to the current Covid-19 curfew in effect, the JEE Main exam has been postponed with new date unlikely to be announced before April 15. And many academicians believe that a minimum of seven-day notice will be given before the next exam is held.

Zafar Khan, a former principal who now runs a residential coaching institute, said, “Due to the virus outbreak, children have more time to study, but the main concern is about their concentration levels. Coaching classes have been using online study platforms so that students don’t lose their seriousness regarding the exam. Regular tests are being conducted, and I would just request all students to stay at home, stay safe because health comes first.”

Senior academician Rajnikant Bondre said, “It is good for students who are lagging as they now have some time to prepare well for their exams. This lockdown has a positive side as students who don’t have a habit of self-studies are now developing that habit. Self-study is one of the major ways to clear your exams with flying colours.”

Well known coaching institute owner Panini Telang feels the gap may also have a negative impact. “Students are loosing interest in studies and there’s no momentum either. There is an uncertainty as it is also not sure whether the exams are going to be conducted or not. I would like to advise students not to loose interest and keep practicing,” said Telang.

Yogesh Sharma, a competitive coaching institute owner, said, “The delay is a bit annoying from the students point of view. I suggest they should make a timetable of 20-30 days until the next dates for the paper are not announced. The timetable should be such that there should be some time for their entrainment also, which would keep their minds fresh.”

437,['28/03/2020'],"Keralite among Af gurdwara attackers, did it for ‘Muslims in Kashmir’, says IS","NEW DELHI: The Islamic State-Khorasan Province has claimed that Thursday’s suicide attack on a Sikh gurdwara in Kabul , which killed 25 people, was carried out by one of its Indian recruits, who has now been identified as Muhammad Muhsin from Kasaragod, Kerala .

Muhsin, sources in Indian agencies said, was named in the IS message as Abu Khalid al-Hindi — which also claimed the bombing as an act of revenge for Kashmiri Muslims — but his real identity was confirmed based on his photograph released by Al-Amaq News, a pro-IS media outlet. The picture showed him brandishing a gun and surrounded by ammunition, with an IS flag for the background.

Sources said the NIA on Friday corroborated Muhsin’s identity by getting in touch with his family in Kasaragod. More details are expected after further probe. There was no clarity on whether a case would be filed.

Initial probe showed that Muhsin did not figure in any of the existing cases being probed by the NIA, relating to those from Kerala who have travelled out of the country so far to join IS.

Sources said Muhsin’s last known location was the UAE, where he had travelled to from India in July 2018. “It is not known how and when he travelled further to reach Afghanistan. A school dropout aged 28-29 years, Muhsin — given the ‘kunya’ name Abu Khalid al-Hindi — was allegedly one of the three suspected attackers involved in the Kabul gurdwara bombing. “Neither was Muhsin on the NIA radar nor had his parents approached the police/NIA to report him as ‘missing’,” an official told TOI.

Islamic State-Khorasan Province, in its message published on March 25, said the Indian fighter Abu Khalid al-Hindi fired upon “Sikh polytheists” in their temple in Kabul, and detonated explosive devices on Afghan security forces. The group said, “This attack comes as revenge for the Muslims in Kashmir , and what is coming is more devastating and bitter, with permission from Allah the Almighty.”

438,['28/03/2020'],Potato growers in north Bengal hit hard by lockdown,"Jalpaiguri/Hooghly: The lockdown has hit the late potato harvest in north Bengal’s six districts, spelling doom for small growers. Labourers aren’t coming to the fields to collect the tuber and there are few vehicles in the local market.

Trucks from outside were blocked by locals in Cooch Behar’ Haldibari wholesale market a few days ago over the virus fear. Some labourers are not stepping out of home while others say police aren’t allowing more than seven labourers on one bigha when the minimum requirement is 10-12.

Dinesh Burman of Mandalghat, who had taken loans for potato farming on 12 bighas, said: “I couldn’t take the yield to the market. Potatoes are lying on the field.” He pointed out cultivatation on one bigha costs Rs 17,000-18,000. Except for Dhupguri wholesale market, the scene is similar in Falakata, Mekhliganj, Belakoba and Moynaguri.

“A total of 25 lakh metric tonnes of potato have been produced in north Bengal’s six districts. In Jalpaiguri, the total acreage is 30,000 hectares of which 15,000 are spread across Dhupguri block,” an agriculture department official said. “There are only 43 cold storages in north Bengal and the storage capacity is only 531,094 metric tons.” This makes storage and marketing of the late tuber dependent on traders from south Bengal. The latter have stopped coming, though chief minister Mamata Banerjee has addressed some of the transportation problems on Friday.

Farmers want the government to procure part of the produce for midday meals and ration, and distribute them to the poor. “We aren’t getting labourers. Even if we get some, there is no transport to market the yield. Meanwhile, potato is selling at Rs 18 a kilo on the Jalpaiguri market,” trader Debashis Chakraborty said.

The matter has been referred to the task force set up to remove commodity transport bottlenecks. “We are trying to contact north Bengal’s potato farmers. We will soon send trucks to some of these blocks and load the produce for the city market. We will load potatoes on the field, sort them and market them through the 140 Sufal Bangla stalls spread across the state,” the CM’s agriculture adviser Pradip Mazumdar said after the task force meeting on Friday.

439,['28/03/2020'],West Bengal govt takes steps to cure supply hiccups,"CM Mamata Banerjee distributes relief materials in Alipore on Friday

KOLKATA: The Bengal government has taken a slew of measures to remove bottlenecks in handling and transport of essential commodities from the Posta wholesale market. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee believes these measures will help restore the supply chain from Monday.

Banerjee, in a meeting with Posta traders, asked them to accommodate daily labourers in neighbouring dharmashalas in the city. The government, along with the Posta traders, is also arranging for daily meals for them.

The government is also in touch with the transport department to run a skeletal bus service to transport labourers. In addition, the chief minister has asked traders to engage local youths on a daily wage of Rs 250 to help load and unload commodities and serve as health workers.

“No one should come in the way of the movement of essential commodities,” Banerjee said in Nabanna on Friday. “We received 12 complaints in this regard. Seven to eight policemen have been closed. A person going to the ration shop will be having a ration card; allow him. So should a person going to a medicine shop; he must be having a prescription.”

Fake news: CM talks tough against rumour-mongers

CM Mamata Banerjee said doctors, nurses, health workers, Asha workers, home delivery boys shouldn’t be stopped because of the lockdown. But they should not move in groups, she added. She assured citizens that there was no dearth of medicine. “We have acted on the complaints. We are also holding talks on home delivery. It will be sorted out in a day or two.”

Banerjee lauded efforts by a section of police during the lockdown. “I have seen how the police took a pregnant woman to the hospital. Some gave blood to an ailing senior citizen. I would appeal to the police to enforce the lockdown with a humane face,” she said. The government has also shifted street children to 27 night shelters in Kolkata and Howrah. “Why should people stay on pavements? They should stay at night shelters,” she said after visiting a night shelter at Kalighat on Friday.

The government, in a bid to ensure senior citizens didn’t run out of money during the lockdown, has released old-age pensions for two months in advance. Mamata, however, reminded everyone that this situation wasn’t normal, when someone told her that there was a dearth of bread in the market. “The lockdown is no ordinary situation. There may be some teething problems. You have to find out alternatives. So what if you don’t get bread. You can make rotis at home,” she said.

The chief minister also thanked religious organisations that have stalled gatherings in view of the lockdown. She thanked state governments that responded to her appeal and arranged for basic facilities for workers from Bengal stranded in other states. “Thanks to the Maharashtra government; it has taken prompt steps. We are also taking care of people from other states locked up in our state,” she said.

She also sent out a stern warning to those who have uploaded “fake news” on social media. “My health secretary has forwarded the post to me. It shows how a doctor treating Covid-19 patients has fallen sick. This is totally baseless. I have been saying that people having exposure to corona victims are most vulnerable, but the news is baseless. I have referred the matter to the detective

441,['28/03/2020'],Substation fire hits power in S Kolkata,"Kolkata: Several thousand households in Patuli, Garia and Santoshpur in south Kolkata were plunged into darkness on Friday evening following a high-voltage flash and fire at a CESC substation . A team of engineers is trying to restore power supply to the affected areas.

The Patuli substation of the private utility shut down around 6pm with an arc flash and a loud bang. Thick black smoke prompted residents to alert the fire brigade. Seven fire tenders rushed to the spot and the fire was doused by 7.10pm.

With parts of the 11KV distribution substation inundated in water used to control the blaze, restoration was carried out from other feeders. A CESC official said power to the entire affected zone would be restored before midnight.

“A fault had occurred in substation switch, leading to a high-voltage flash that led to supply breakdown. In some areas, supply was switched off as a safety measure. They are being restored from other points. Since the equipment here is completely wet, it needs to dry up before we can investigate the cause and rectify it,” said the official.

This is the first major emergency here after the lockdown was imposed on Monday. CESC, which supplies power to Kolkata, and WBSEDCL that caters to Salt Lake and the rest of the state have quick response teams on standby. The private power utility has 250 teams, comprising around 2,000 people working in shifts round the clock.

NAVI MUMBAI: A day after a 65-year-old Govandi woman succumbed to coronavirus infection, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation blamed two hospitals for not following the protocol while referring her to other hospitals.

In fact, the municipal commissioner had even served a show-cause notice to Dr D Y Patil Hospital on Thursday. But the two hospitals-Dr DY Patil Hospital in Nerul and Tandon Hospital in Chembur-clarified that they had followed due procedure.

The woman was initially admitted to Tandon Hospital, then shifted to Dr DY Patil Hospital, which, in turn, referred her to NMMC Hospital in Vashi, where she died four hours after being admitted.

If Covid-19 is prolonged and supply chain disruptions get accentuated, the global slowdown could deepen with adverse implications for India,” the central bank governor said. He added that the slump in international crude prices could, however, provide some relief in the form of terms of trade gains.He said downside risks to growth arise from the spread of Covid-19 and prolonged lockdowns and upside growth impulses are expected to emanate from monetary, fiscal and other policy measures and the early containment of Covid-19.On inflation, the RBI governor said the prints of January and February 2020 indicate that actual outcomes for the quarter are running 30 bps above projections, reflecting the onion price shock.The government lauded the RBI’s move with PM Narendra Modi and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman expressing their strong backing of the central bank’s bold moves to combat the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak. “Today the RBI has taken giant steps to safeguard our economy from the impact of the coronavirus.

KERI: With a complete lockdown on all things alcoholic, people from the border villages of Maharashtra and Karnataka are desperate for a tipple.

Closed roads and highways mean there is no easy way into Goa for their usual urrack and feni. For the last three days villagers from Virdi, Talekhol, Aayi in Maharashtra have resorted to walking across the border into Goa through traditional jungle paths.

On Thursday, Valpoi police inspector Shivram Vaigankar received information that some people from neighbouring villages were to arrive in Shiroli. On investigation, police found villagers from Virdi and Talekhol had assembled at traditional liquor distillery units here. When it was revealed that they had come specially to drink urrak and feni, they were forced to disperse after police threatened to beat them with lathis.

Vaigankar told TOI, “We have taken serious note of those coming from Maharashtra. To control the movement of villagers from across the border, instructions have been given to police officials to take action against violators of the lockdown.”

Monitor and if necessary, review decision, govt told

Sawant said all shops selling essential commodities will continue to be open, but people should refrain from venturing out.

“People should themselves follow lockdown in totality. If you come out from your homes, then there is a possibility that you will take back coronavirus and risk your family,” he said after a meeting with MLAs.

Sawant said during the meeting, BJP MLAs took the responsibility to start home delivery services in their respective constituencies.

The high court impressed upon the government the need to constantly monitor, supervise and if necessary review or recall its decisions if the situation at the ground level demands.

“If the experience suggests that there is necessity to revert to the earlier decision involving closure of all grocery shops, such decision will have to be taken and not avoided,” the court said.

Sawant said they have issued volunteer passes to panchayat members across 191 villages and councillors of 14 municipal councils including the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP).

“Besides these, we have also issued 20 volunteer passes to all MLAs to supply essential commodities to the public,” Sawant said.

Sawant said booth level officers (BLOs) of the respective wards have also been issued volunteer passes.

He said food packets of Rs 300, Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 would be made and it would be distributed in constituencies.

Sawant said only bona fide residents would be allowed entry into the state through the borders after putting home quarantine stamp.

He said the government has established five quarantine centres in north Goa and four in south Goa and the virology lab has already begun operations.

“If any one comes across people with travel history, then people of that villages should inform authorities, so that he/she can be kept under home quarantine. Lots of people did not disclose their travel history,” he said.

BENGALURU: When the nation went into a lockdown, residents panicked wondering if their local grocery shops would still be open. Many went on a stockpiling spree, crowding supermarkets and medical shops. However, one policewoman helped restore calm among residents of Pulikeshinagar , east Bengaluru.

Armed with a public address system, ACP Tabarak Fathima, 32, has been going around giving pep talks to residents, playing songs about staying in and sanitising one’s hands and spreading a message of hope.

The officer has so far visited Richards Town, Netaji Road, Diamond District in Domlur and Polluramma slum in Doddigunta , Cox Town. She hopes to cover every locality in her sub-division.

Videos of Fathima have gone viral on social media with hundreds of people appreciating the move. In one video, Fathima can be seen giving a new twist to the song ‘Hum Honge Kamyaab’ (We shall overcome) and singing “We shall stay at home, we shall sanitise.” It was viewed more than 24,000 times.

“When there is fear, people need hope. ‘Hum Honge Kamyaab’ is a song of hope,” Fathima told TOI. “The moment people hear there’s a lockdown, the first thing that comes to their mind is ‘where will my food come from’. I realised it is important to assure people their access to essential commodities is secure.”

Residents have also posted videos of the ACP addressing them. “What an excellent speech, reassuring us that all essential services will not be affected, yet calmly asking us to stay indoors and not panic. Am talking about this police officer who came to Davis Road this afternoon. This was outside my apartment today,” tweeted @sai_ ganesh, a resident of Davis Road, along with a video. The post was shared over 1.9k times.

Awareness is key

Fathima, who joined the city police in December 2019, leaves home as early as 6am, and is on the field till late at night. “The police department has been at it 24*7. If there is a situation that demands our presence, we get on the job right away,” she said. Speaking about how cops are keeping themselves calm in this scenario, the ACP pointed out that awareness is key. “We have educated police officers at all levels on the dangers of the virus, how it spreads and the precautionary measures to be taken. We maintain distance between staff and between staff and public. Out stations are sanitised every day,” she said.

469,['28/03/2020'],Grocers will receive fresh stock soon: South Goa collector,"Shoppers thronged Gandhi market, Margao, on Friday amid claims of vendors overcharging.

MARGAO: South Goa collector Ajit Roy on Friday said that grocery stores and shops across Goa will be flush with food items within a day or two, as trucks and other goods carriers that were stranded at various places have now been allowed to proceed to their respective destinations.

“The Centre took a decision last night to allow all trucks in transit stranded at state borders to proceed to their destinations. All such vehicles which were unable to come to Goa will now start coming in. We will now have markets full of all essential food items,” Roy said.

The South Goa district administration has also stopped enrolling volunteers as it has focused its attention on streamlining the food supply chain. “We don’t need volunteers, as all grocery shops and fruit and vegetable stalls will be kept open without any time restrictions,” Roy said.

However, Roy stressed that movement of vehicles has been completely prohibited, except for those engaged in ‘essential services’ and for emergency situations. “We will be increasing deployment (of security personnel) for strict checking for any movement of vehicles,” he said.

The South Goa administration has also appointed incident commanders talukawise to take control of the situation, and new quarantine centres are being identified to house Covid-19 suspects.

Sources said that while grocery shops will be encouraged to do home delivery of goods, vegetable vendors will also be asked to sell their goods moving door-to-door. “The idea is to ensure that there are not many people on the streets. Though all grocery shops will be open, police have been asked to close down the shops if people are found crowding the shops or not maintaining social distancing,” a senior official told TOI.

Director, civil supplies and consumer affairs, Siddhivinayak Naik, said that all fair price shops will be open from April 1. The state government, he said, has decided to allot twice the quantity of food items to beneficiaries of fair prices shops. “We have enough stocks to last us until next month,” Naik said.

BENGALURU: Of the 64 positive Covid-19 cases in Karnataka so far, 15, or 23%, have no history of travelling to any of the affected countries. These patients include a doctor and a security guard besides wives, daughters and domestic helps who had come in contact with persons who tested positive after having travelled to an affected country.

However, three cases have left doctors puzzled as they do not appear – at least from an initial tracing of movements – to have had contact with a positive patient. They include a 10-month-old baby boy, a 60-year-old man from Tumakuru who died on Friday and a 35-year-old Mysurean.

The baby though had accompanied his parents to Kerala , while the Tumakuru man had been to Delhi. The Mysurean was employed in the quality assurance section of a pharmaceutical company in Nanjangud and was in contact with many healthcare professionals, health department officials said.

“We will have to trace the movements of all three patients,” said Jawaid Akhtar , additional chief secretary, health and family welfare department. “We are in the process of tracing their travel history. There is no evidence of community spread yet. They could have come in contact with a positive patient.”

Officials admit that the spread of the virus does raise questions as all the other infections have been intra-family affairs or limited to primary contacts of the positive patients.

Three girls are among the infected, having contracted the virus from their fathers who had a history of travel to affected countries. Two of the girls are siblings. The girls’ mothers too tested positive.

The siblings, aged seven and nine, tested positive on March 25. Their father had returned from the Netherlands and tested positive in Bengaluru on March 21. His wife tested positive on March

23. The wife and daughter of the state’s first Covid-19 patient, a techie, also tested positive. Incidentally, all three have been discharged.

A 45-year-old man working as a security guard in Bengaluru tested positive on Thursday, four days after his 51-year-old employer returned from London tested positive on March 22. Three women working as domestic helps in households of positive patients with travel history to affected countries are among the infected.

“When we say suspected cases should be in home isolation, we don’t mean their interaction is restricted only to the world outside. They should be careful at home too,” said a senior health officer, who has been involved in monitoring home quarantine cases.

“There are mandatory self-hygiene and cough-hygiene guidelines that they have got to follow and they need to maintain the social distance at home too. Going by these cases, there appears to be sheer lapses. It’s extremely important to ensure possible carriers of the virus behave responsibly.”

A large number of migrant workers are engaged in jobs in almost every part of Haryana, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. The lockdown has completed rendered them jobless and as trains and buses are not running and consequently they cannot return to their native places.

Only a handful of grocery stores opened on Friday, only to be swarmed by customers. Though store keepers tried to ration the items, most of them ran out of stock by late morning.Atta, maida, milk, curd, paneer, pulses and edible oils, which flew off the shelves across the city, were hardly replenished. Most of the wholesalers said their delivery mechanism had been largely disrupted by lockdown . Any inkling of an impending shortage triggered a scramble for hoarding. The crisis is more behavioural than real, said Biswanath Agarwal, general secretary of Post Merchants’ Association.Agarwal assured that the current stock will last not only the lockdown period but much beyond that. “There are some issues with shortage of labourers. But with the help of retailers, we managed to send grocery items to many parts of the city,” he said. However, the distribution of grocery has not been even, leaving the demand-supply gap yawning.Many buyers who had booked these items with e-tailers are yet to get their deliveries. E-commerce sites like Grofers and BigBasket kept postponing deliveries.The supply chain in grocery items has suffered a big jolt. Around 60% of Posta-Burrabazar wholesale shops remained shut on Friday. “The ban on intra-state and intra-district truck movement has depleted stocks. Clearing of stocks lying in the warehouses needs labourers, but most of them have left for their homes,” said a Posta Traders’ Association member.Under strict watch of market monitoring agencies and police, prices of grocery remained static except at a few places. According to markets experts, the supply chain has improved a lot over last few days. With panic buying petering out, they expect the availability of grocery items to improve a lot in a day or two.Meanwhile, the vegetable supply chain has become a lot more stable, bringing down prices of most items. “The prices of spring-summer vegetables have come down a lot. The situation has improved after the chief minister’s warning against blocking vendors’ way to the market. However, some have stopped coming since they cannot afford hiring goods vehicles,” said Kamal Dey, president of the West Bengal Vendors’ Association.However, fish and egg supply has suffered a setback with the lockdown. Syed Anwar Maqsood, the secretary of Howrah fish market, said loading of fish from Andhra Pradesh has completely stopped. “From Wednesday, fish prices have gone up by 10%-20%,” he added.

Whether it is Amlodipin (for high blood pressure), Metformin (diabetes) or Ranitidine (stomach ulcer), we are saying no to customers,” said Prashanta Pal, a medicine shop owner on Mall Road, Dum Dum. “Syringes used by diabetic patients are almost out of stock.

Initially, I thought of hiring some people to bring the supplies, but even they are unwilling to do the work,” said Durga Prasad Banerjee of Durga Medical Stores on Makardah Road. Retailers normally keep a low stock during March and stack it up during April, but the lockdown caught them unawares.Lakshmi Medical Hall on Bhagaban Chatterjee Street has shut down for want of supply replenishment. ""Gradually, all the medical stores, other than a handful of those that are a part of the big chain, will not be able to function,"" rued owner Kashinath Das.

Officials say private hospitals are not shouldering the Covid-19 burden to the extent they can, despite making promises at meetings held with their representatives twice in a week.At Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases, the state’s nodal centre for Covid-19 treatment, all 15 isolation beds are occupied. Cases coming to RGICD are now being referred to other government hospitals.The Federation of Healthcare Associations of Karnataka recently wrote to the government asking it to be ready with 2,000 critical care beds. The association offered some staff, but there is no mention of private hospitals willing to admit patients.Private hospitals say the reason for their reluctance is non-availability of personal protection equipment (PPE) and hydroxychloroquine tablets, which have been prescribed by ICMR for prophylactic treatment of healthcare professionals involved in treating those infected.“We have repeatedly brought the PPE situation to the government’s notice, but the equipment is still not available. If the situation does not improve, hospitals will have to shut down. We can’t compromise on the safety of our doctors, nurses and allied personnel,” said a representative of a leading hospital.Medical education minister K Sudhakar had earlier stated that patients can choose the hospital at the time of admission and decide if they want to get treated in a private facility. There are 35 first responder private hospitals in Bengaluru, including some private medical colleges.Dr Nagendra Swamy , principal coordinator of Federation of Healthcare Associations Karnataka , said the need of the hour is to keep all Covid-19 patients in one isolated hospital instead of several hospitals which will have many other patients. “There are chances of healthcare workers contracting the infection, which is spreading fast.

But the not-so-fortunate ones in this turn of events were the thousands of animals out on the streets that were dependent on the scraps left behind at markets and restaurants, among others, who were suddenly left with no source of food. Since the shutdown, many netizens have been wondering aloud what would become of the stray animals? And urban Bengaluru, it seems, has found a solution.

“We recently had a meeting with government officials and ministers, wherein we explained how we could help these animals. The modus operandi was to have 150 volunteers across Bengaluru, each of who would be responsible for feeding animals in a particular area at a designated time,” explains actress Samyukta Hornad , who is spearheading the initiative along with wildlife activist Sanjeev Pednekar .

Sanjeev says, “With meat markets, stalls, bakeries and restaurants shut, most of these dogs do not have their regular source of food anymore. This is where these feeders will come into place. The plan is to identify individuals who can help with sourcing meat, rice and other food that will then be picked up from drop off points by designated volunteers at stipulated times daily.”

Strays help avoid other epidemics: experts

If we look at history, every time the city wore a deserted look, it has had to deal with epidemics — such as the plague. Dogs help keep the rat population under control. So, if they are not taken care of, rats will set off an epidemic.

478,['28/03/2020'],stray dogs: 150 volunteers to ensure that no stray goes hungry in Bengaluru,"As Bengaluru got wind of the enormity of the coronavirus pandemic and began to go into shutdown mode weeks ago, the foremost thing on most people’s agenda was to stock up on essentials. But the not-so-fortunate ones in this turn of events were the thousands of animals out on the streets that were dependent on the scraps left behind at markets and restaurants, among others, who were suddenly left with no source of food. Since the shutdown, many netizens have been wondering aloud what would become of the stray animals? And urban Bengaluru, it seems, has found a solution. “We recently had a meeting with government officials and ministers, wherein we explained how we could help these animals. The modus operandi was to have 150 volunteers across Bengaluru, each of who would be responsible for feeding animals in a particular area at a designated time,” explains actress Samyukta Hornad, who is spearheading the initiative along with wildlife activist Sanjeev Pednekar.Sanjeev says, “With meat markets, stalls, bakeries and restaurants shut, most of these dogs do not have their regular source of food anymore. This is where these feeders will come into place. The plan is to identify individuals who can help with sourcing meat, rice and other food that will then be picked up from drop off points by designated volunteers at stipulated times daily.”Strays help avoid other epidemics: experts If we look at history, every time the city wore a deserted look, it has had to deal with epidemics — such as the plague. Dogs help keep the rat population under control. So, if they are not taken care of, rats will set off an epidemic.

BENGALURU: At a time when citizens are scrambling for groceries, pet parents in the city are a worried lot. Reason: getting meat and pet food is turning out to be a big challenge.

A large number of pet parents rely on chicken from neighbourhood stores and ecommerce retailers, but with the lockdown in place, stores are closed and e-commerce retailers are mostly out of stock.

“I live in an area where sourcing meat is difficult even on normal days. Now, local stores are closed and police are stopping deliveries. My orders on e-commerce retailers got cancelled several times. But I have to keep checking all the sites for availability. My dog has a medical condition and has to be on a meat-based diet,” said Sophia Thiyam, a medical student in Basavanagudi .

Sanjana Madappa, who works for Compassion Unlimited Plus Action (CUPA), a shelter for dogs, said, “We have 130 dogs at our adoption centre and we usually need 50-60kg of meat a day. Our regular vendor has been unable to source meat for us every day so we have been forced to ration the chicken and complement it with rice. It’s a difficult situation.”

Many have tweaked their pets’ diet owing to the scarcity. “We fed our dogs curd rice and rice with veggies for three days till we could source some meat,” said Prashant P, a resident of Hennur, who has a Labrador and an Indie.

Suchishmita Datta, a resident on Sarjapur Road, who owns a cocker spaniel named Whiskey is worried as she doesn’t know when she’d get to buy meat again. “I also feed the street dogs here. We have to shift to rice and pulses,” said the IT professional.

Those relying on food from pet stores aren’t that lucky either. “We have been trying to get passes from the DCP’s office. There are frantic calls from pet parents. We open every couple of days for a few hours and help them. The shop was extremely crowded on Thursday. With no meat supply, people are stocking up on dog/cat kibble. Stocks are running out,” said Ritima Coelho , co-founder, Heads up for tails, Magrath Road.

Officials in the department of animal husbandry said transportation of chicken will be smoother in the coming days and the problem will get sorted. “The issue was with the transportation and things will be better soon,” said S Shashi Kumar , joint director, department of animal husbandry, BBMP.

480,['28/03/2020'],Kolkata: Traders treat hungry workers to khichdi,"Cops distribute food among labourers and kids in Posta.

KOLKATA: Managing committees of many markets in the city have started providing food for drivers of goods vehicles, van rickshaw pullers and labourers to stop them for leaving for their hometowns, which will disrupt the supply chain of essential food commodities from wholesale markets to retail outlets.

Many members of this labour force — which forms an important cog in the delivery chain of food commodities — have already left the city fearing tough times during the three-week lockdown without food and shelter.

The impact can already be felt with most wholesale outlets in Posta and Burrabazar staying shut despite presence of stock in their godowns because there are no labourers to pack and deliver them to retail outlets.

“If the remaining labourers also leave, we will be in a very critical situation because they are going to play a crucial role in keeping the shelves replenished,” said Tarak Nath Trivedi, secretary of the Entally market committee.

More than 125 people were fed khichdi in the afternoon and preparations were afoot for making dinner. “From unloading goods from vehicles to ferrying essential commodities from the wholesale markets, we are heavily dependent on them. A couple of days into the lockdown, many of them approached us as eateries where they would normally eat, were shut. We decided to take care of the food for who were still here,” said Trivedi.

Most of the labourers working in these markets is from the neighbouring state. Numerous eateries in the central business district that sell food for much less, function as their lifeline. Most of them sleep inside the markets or in their vehicles. The eatery owners are not opening fearing backlash from cops, leaving thousands of labourers hunting for food.

When CM Mamata Banerjee visited Posta on Thursday, many traders raised the issue with her. She instructed the cops to shift the labourers to rest houses in the area and hire more local people for the work. On Friday, khichdi was made for almost 250 people by the Posta Bazar Merchants’ Association.

“Not a single eatery is open in Posta or Burrabazar. In a meeting with the cops on Thursday evening, we requested them to ensure some eateries open so that these labourers can get food. Till then, we will provide them with lunch and dinner,” said an office bearer of the association.

Many who were planning to leave for some relatives’ place in the suburbs have changed their

Krittika Srikanth, a professional and a plant blogger, says, “I have fully focussed on my plants and home in the past few days, organising things that were kept pending for so long.
