Understandably then, innovation has become the key for channels to stay afloat until the circumstances get better.“We have begun playing the title songs of our popular daily soapsand. These go on for up to a minute or more and sum up the high points of the serial with corresponding visuals,” says Raghavendra Hunsur , business head of a regional TV channel.Following this will be reruns of hit fiction and non-fiction programmes, movies, audio launches and award shows. “We are also planning to introduce voiceovers that will narrate the story and even have the lead actors share anecdotes from the show. In terms of non-fiction, we have hits likeand, hoping to keep the audiences’ interest piqued through the lockdown,” adds Raghavendra.“A three-minute recap is being aired with every episode of our serials including Premaloka and Muddulakshmi, irrespective of the time. It’s played either in the beginning or in the end. These three-minute videos are like capsules which can be aired at any point of time, so if there is a short duration of fresh content in one of the serials, these capsules are being used as fillers,” shares a production house official of another channel. These unique measures, adds the source, will help in longer run time of the content they have on hand. Parmeshwar Gundkal, business head of another regional channel, insists that they are committed to give their viewers engaging content even amid the lockdown. “We have not started recaps or resorted to shorter runtime yet.

last week, a Delhi man was arrested for spitting paan all over a Manipuri girl’s face, hair and T-shirt. “He called me ‘coronavirus’ before fleeing on his scooter,” the girl complained. Meanwhile in Ahmedabad, nine youngsters from Nagaland were forced to spend 24 hours at a quarantine facility, despite testing negative for COVID-19 and having no travel history. On Saturday, two Naga students lodged a police complaint in Mysuru after they were denied entry into a supermarket. “We showed them our proof (Aadhaar card) and told them, ‘we are from Northeast India and are college students’, but still they said, ‘we don’t accept foreigners’. We were arguing to prove ourselves as Indian in our own nation. We went back home without groceries (sic),” one of the students shared on social media, along with a video of the incident, which has subsequently gone viral. The fear of coronavirus has brought out the worst in some of us, and facing the brunt of it are those hailing from Northeast Indian states. ‘It’s like we’re fighting two deadly viruses — covid-19 and racism ,’ they say.Though the COVID-19 outbreak began to get worse in India only during early to mid-March, the discrimination began as early as February. Abem Khwairakpam, a Manipuri who works at a parlour in Coimbatore, says, “I went to Kerala for a vacation in February, and was shocked when a few people heckled me saying ‘corona, corona’. It saddens me to see that people are not even aware that we’re not Chinese. Northeast is an integral part of India. People need to be better informed about our geography, or the discrimination will continue.”A group of students from Kolkata’s Jadavpur University have a similar story to tell. “In the last week of February, my friends and I went to BAPS Shree Swaminarayan Mandir in Thakurpukur, Behala. There was a group of students there along with their teachers. As soon as I entered the temple, one of the teachers, said, ‘It is because of you we have coronavirus’. I was appaled to see teachers behave like that,” says Thinley Bhutia, who hails from Kalimpong.The racism is hard to miss even when there are no words spoken. Ragini Thapa, a Delhi University student who hails from Manipur, experienced that first hand when travelling in metro with a friend, before the lockdown came into effect. “As soon as I stepped in, a woman looked at me and immediately covered her face with a dupatta. Unfortunately, two stations later, I got a seat next to her. She became extremely uncomfortable and left her seat and stood near the exit gate. She did not say anything but sometimes such gestures speak volumes. That is no way to treat a fellow human being.”Kuldeep Bhaswa, a sales engineer from Nagaland, who lives in Hyderabad, “was screamed at by a security guard at a bank for not wearing a mask.” Not stopping at thet, the guard also blamed him for spreading the virus, he says. “When I tried to explain to him that only those who are sick need to wear a mask, he insisted that I should wear one because I belong to ‘that country’. There were many who were not wearing a mask, but I was singled out,” says Kuldeep, adding, “It hurts to be treated like a pariah by your own countrymen.”Wapang Toshi, President, Northeast India Welfare Association, Chennai, says the discrimination is rising at an alarming level. “Most people think we’re Chinese because of the way we look. They shame us by calling us ‘corona’. Some even think we’re carriers of the virus. Many of our people have been denied essential services like groceries and medicines. This discrimination is concerning,” he says, adding, “How many times do we need to prove that we are Indians? All of India is battling the coronavirus today, but the people of Northeast are fighting on two fronts: coronavirus and racial discrimination.”Pranab Jyoti Borah, member of the Assam Association in Bengaluru, says that in the past one week, the association has received over 100 complaints of discrimination from the northeast community. “Many women, who live in PGs were asked to leave by their owners. We had to intervene and request owners. In many cases, when our pleas fell on deaf ears, we had to seek help from the police,” adds Pranab.What’s more disturbing is that people from the medical community, who are working round-the-clock to control the pandemic, are not spared from racism either. Aashna Lemo, a nursing student from Arunachal Pradesh, who lives in Hyderabad, says, “A ward boy in our hospital called me coronavirus and went on to verballu abuse me in Telugu. Miffed, I immediately filed a complaint with the chief doctor. Swift action was taken against the ward boy, but what about the others, who blatantly pass racist slurs at us. Who will punish them? After working in 16-hour-shifts in these circumstances, we have to deal with racism.”Ektha Roy, a Manipuri who studies at medical college in Hyderabad, adds, “We are being treated like untouchables. I overheard a few girls in my hostel point towards me and say, ‘All these viruses spread because of these chinky people’. It’s bad enough that we’re staying by ourselves away from our families during this time of crisis. It hurts when you hear such things and we can’t even share with our families, cause they’re already worried about us and this will make it worse.”A nurse from Nagaland, who works at a Ghaziabad hospital, says she was asked to be replaced by patients, ‘cos they suspected her to be infected with coronavirus. Speaking to us on the condition of anonymity, she says, “There have been quite a few occasions where patients I’ve attended to or their attendants have requested the doctors or other nurses to replace me. They never say anything directly to my face but their discomfort shows. Once a colleague asked an attendant as to why they were asking for me to be changed and they said, ‘Kya pata inko corona ho!’ I understand everyone is worried but this is very insulting and demeaning.”Besides being subjected to cat-calling and racist slurs on the streets, people from the northeast are also being discriminated at workplaces as well. Prakruthi Chakma, a 26-year-old from Manipur who works at a boutique in Hyderabad, says “I was asked by my store manager to go home. When I asked him why, he said it was for my own safety. The store was still open and all the staff went to work till the lockdown was imposed. That was painful.”Taking a firm stand against reports of racism against northeastern people in Hyderabad, Telangana ’s IT Minister KTR instructed the police to take strict action against the offenders. Taking to Twitter, KTR said, “This is indeed repugnant, absolutely unacceptable.

Protecting, motivating the staff

Microbrewery makes sanitisers

The other side of the spectrum

Even at a time when shuttered city restaurants are staring at an uncertain future, many owners and chefs are coming forward to serve people in this hour of crisis. While some of them are cooking every day to feed the underprivileged, others are using their microbreweries to manufacture chemicals for sanitisers.Piccadilly square, Sanjha Chulha and Khichdi Khichri have joined hands to set up kitchens across city, to distribute food packets to the needy. Three temporary kitchens - at Babughat, Metropolitan and Jodhpur Park - are serving more than 1,000 people as of now. They have even adopted an orphanage and a slum near Ruby Hospital, so that no one goes to bed hungry. Meanwhile, industrialist Harshvardhan Neotia ’s hospitality team at Aafra has come forward to cook meals for those in need. They have started distributing about 500 food packets to the poor and are ready to do more. Pooja Baid , owner of Piccadilly Square, said the need of the hour, for daily wagers, is assured food, like a dal chawal or khichdi. ""It is not about providing a sumptuous spread but the basic, so that these people can stay afloat,” she said.Restaurant chains with a large number of employees are trying to keep the moral high. Chowman, Oudh 1590 and Chapter 2 have closed all services for more than a week. The challenge, says Debaditya Chaudhury, co- owner, is taking care of more than 1500 employees from different states, half of whom was unable to go back home. All kitchens of the chain are now working to feed the work force that is stuck in the city.Motivating teams is a concern for many. Harshvardhan Neotia has been sending out motivational videos for his employees. “Instead of complaining, we should engage ourselves in self-improvement activities. I have also asked team leaders in my organisation to engage in conference calls with their respective teams every day,” he said.Spice Kraft, on the other hand, has closed their services much before the nation-wide lockdown was announced. On March 20, before closing down, they distributed all the ingredients and raw material among the staff members. “I hate wasting food. But more than that, we wanted our employees to have basic food items before closing down,” said Sambit.The scarcity of sanitisers inspired the entire team at The Grid, a popular microbrewery, to help make chemicals for sanitisers and disinfectants along with another company. They are currently making around 30,000 bottles of sanitisers per day at their facilities in Salt Lake and Rajarhat. “We are here to make sure that City of Joy does not run out of hand sanitisers. My team is like an army, fighting this war,” said Gaurav Karnani, co-founder.Supriya Mondal, a rickshaw driver, who lives in a slum near Ruby, rued, “I am not being able to drive my auto because of the lockdown. So far, we have been managing from our small savings fund. I am the only earning member in my family of four. I was really worried about the situation. At least now we are getting some food served by the restaurant guys. It is more than enough for us.”Like Supriya, Shikha Panigragi, a domestic help, informed that most of the households have asked her not to work for the time being. Many of them are not even paying the salary. “Now that we are getting food packets, I don’t have to worry about next month,” she said, adding that she has already spent a lot, buying masks and sanitisers for her family.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74902544,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-157566,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/lockdown-but-not-out-city-eateries-feed-the-poor-make-sanitisers/articleshow/74902544.cms

This is in addition to contributions received in the PM’s relief fund.According to sources, the balance in SDRF of states is Rs 30,000 crore as on March 30. The kitty is made out of funds allocated every year to states to meet expenditure on relief and rehabilitation. Since the funds under SDRF and the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF) are non-lapsable, they get added to the kitty.Since 2016-17, the government has allocated over Rs 80,000 crore for disaster relief and rehabilitation — Rs 50,000 crore towards SDRFs and Rs 30,285 from the NDRF. The home ministry, in an order issued on March 14, had classified Covid-19 as a notified disaster for the purpose of providing assistance under SDRF. It had also provided a list of items and norms of assistance for containment of Covid-19 in India, eligible from SDRF and NDRF.Last year, the Centre had allocated Rs 13,465 crore to states under SDRF to meet disaster-related expenditure. In addition, the Centre had allocated over Rs 14,000 crore from the NDRF to eight states — Maharashtra, Karnataka Madhya Pradesh , Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh Bihar and Andhra Pradesh — for exigencies arising out of floods. Kerala already had a balance of Rs 2,100 crore in its SDRF.Looking at largescale exodus of migrant workers from Delhi and other parts of the county to their hometowns, the government on Saturday clarified that fund use under SDRF would include relief measures for this class of people in providing them temporary accommodation, food, clothing and medical care. “This would be applicable to homeless people, including migrant labourers, stranded due to lockdown measures and sheltered in relief camps and other places for providing them food etc for containment of Covid-19 in the country,” the order said.While making it clear that no state will face any funds crunch in meeting expenditure towards the battle against Covid-19, the Centre has directed all states and Union Territories to ensure that the lockdown is followed in true spirit and no movement of any citizen is allowed in any part of the country",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74903055,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-289894,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-fight-govt-has-rs-60k-cr-war-chest-in-disaster-funds/articleshow/74903019.cms

""Without a post-mortem one cannot explain Barman’s death,"" Guwahati-based internal medicine specialist Swarup Jyoti Saikia said, adding that the death did, however, raise ""a red flag"". Doctors said they would investigate the matter thoroughly.Utpaljit Barman (44), who headed the anaesthetics team at Pratiksha Hospital, had sent a message to colleagues in a WhatsApp group about half an hour after suffering the heart attack at home saying, ""HCQS (hydroxychloroquine) is not good as prophylaxis (action taken to prevent disease). Lots of issues. I think I am having some problems after I took it.""The anti-malaria drug is commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis.Pratiksha Hospital medical superintendent Nirmal Hazarika said, ""He took it… not just him, other doctors in our hospital are also taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure. The signs of symptoms at the time of his death were that of a heart attack."" He, however, added that hospital authorities are not yet issuing any instructions to doctors to discontinue the drug.""He suffered the attack at his home at around 2.30 pm and was taken to the hospital where he died after about one and a half hours,"" Hazarika said.Two hydroxychloroquine tablets of 200 mg have to be taken every seven days and Dr Barman had taken his last dose on March 22.""The attack should not have happened in a person with a healthy heart.

13,['31/03/2020'],States taking over star hotels across India,"In their battle against Covid-19 pandemic, state governments have started taking over private hotels, including multi-star facilities, so that they can be converted into special wards for patients in the worst affected cities across the country.

In Indore and Ujjain , the two worst affected cities which account for 70% of Madhya Pradesh ’s total cases, the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government has acquired 28 hotels, resorts and marriage gardens.

Indore Development Authority chief executive officer Vivek Shotriya said that 22 hotels, resorts and marriage gardens have been acquired to set up quarantine centres. “As many as 1,200 patients can be accommodated in these establishments. If needed, we will acquire more buildings,” he said, adding that the target is to make isolation arrangements for at least 2,000 people. In state capital Bhopal, no private hotels have been acquired yet, but district collector Tarun Pithode did not rule out the possibility in the coming days.

In Rajasthan’s Bhilwara town, the worst affected spot in the state, the government has taken over at least 20 hotels and converted them into quarantine centres. ""We have taken over 1,500 rooms and currently 600 people are quarantined in these hotels,"" Bhilwara district collector Rajendra Bhatt told TOI.

In Jaipur, the district administration is arranging for 10,000 emergency isolation beds which will be put up in hotels, private hospitals, university hostels, community halls, dharamshalas and clubs. ""We have identified these hotels. We will use them as and when required,"" said Ashok Kumar, additional DM of Jaipur.

The acquisition of hotels comes days after the governments in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh invoked the British era Epidemic Diseases Act 1897 to acquire private hospitals in these states to combat coronavirus pandemic.

In Kerala, the government has identified private hotels and buildings in several districts. Around 74 buildings, comprising mostly hotels and hostels, have been identified in Ernakulam for setting up isolation wards. In Kasargod, the worst affected district, three hotels have been identified.

In Wayanad, which does not have a major government hospital, 134 hotels with 1,900 rooms have been identified and some of them have already been converted into ‘Covid Care Centres’. As many as 152 people have been placed under observation in nine such resorts.

Similarly, in Thiruvanthapuram, several hotels have been identified, including the iconic Mascot Hotel.

The Yogi Adityanath government in UP has taken over four multi-star hotels in capital Lucknow and one in Agra.

The Goa government has taken over at least one private resort, apart from government-run Goa Tourism Development Corporation residencies for converting them into quarantine facilities.

In Bengaluru, the government has identified 16 hotels, including one frequented by politicians, for housing patients with Covid-19 symptoms. “All primary contacts of Covid-19 positive cases who are asymptomatic, whose immunity level is low and those who are within the quarantine period will be moved to the hotels and kept in individual rooms before being moved to a quarantine facility,” Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) commissioner Anil Kumar said.

BAREILLY: Several batches of migrant workers, including women and children, who arrived in UP from Delhi/NCR in government-run buses over the weekend were made to squat on a road in Bareilly district and sprayed with sodium hypochlorite — a bleaching agent which authorities later admitted was “unfit for use on humans” — in a bid to sanitise them.

After the incident on Sunday attracted widespread criticism, joint secretary (health ministry), Lav Agarwal , blamed it on the “over zealousness of officials who acted out of fear”. The secretary clarified that this was not part of any protocol and was not required.

The Bareilly district administration has now set up a team to investigate the matter. District magistrate Nithish Kumar said treatment would be provided to anybody adversely affected by spraying of sodium hypochlorite. The DM also attributed the incident to “over-cautious” personnel. “They should not have done this, but fortunately no one was harmed,” he told TOI.

City mayor Umesh Gautam admitted “negligence on part of the municipal corporation” and said directions have been issued to not repeat this in future.

The incident occurred after a sanitisation team from the municipal corporation and fire personnel were sent to sanitise the locality of a Covid-19 patient. While returning, they reached Satellite Bus Stand in the city and were disinfecting buses when they started spraying the solution on those who were arriving in the vehicles as well.

A video of the incident shows personnel directing people to close their eyes as the bleaching agent gushes out of a hosepipe and cops look on. Senior superintendent of police (Bareilly) Shailesh Pandey has claimed that police was not involved in any way in the exercise.

Municipal commissioner (Bareilly) Abhishek Anand admitted that the chemical solution was only meant for sanitising roads, walls and metallic surfaces and was “not fit for use on humans”. Chief medical officer Vineet Shukla also added that the solution was likely diluted else it could have had adverse effects.

In a press conference later, Awanish Kumar Awasthi , additional chief secretary (home), defended its use, claiming that sanitisers can be sprayed on any person without fear as per international norms.

Later in the day, BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya tweeted that agencies in Kerala are mass spraying people, “…But all the outrage is only reserved for UP, because a saffron clad monk of the BJP is the chief minister and he is doing a good job.” Kerala officials were quick to clarify. “We have not used any kind of chemical or disinfectant on humans. What was sprayed by our personnel at Wayanad was diluted soap solution,” said director General of fire and rescue force, A Hemachandran.

Priyanka Gandhi shared a video of it on Twitter on Monday, calling it an ‘inhuman act’.

However, instead of fretting over this scarcity, the Udupi district administration has decided to tackle the problem head-on. The officials have identified units across Udupi that can manufacture PPE kits and have placed an order for as many as 1,000 of them, thereby solving the problem locally.Udupi district deputy commissioner G Jagadeesha told STOI that the kits they would receive from the local manufacturers would comprise goggles, masks , face-shields, gloves and gowns. “The company we have placed the order with has agreed to provide the 1,000 kits in three days,” Jagadeesha said.District medical officer Dr Prashanth Bhat said that both the district administration and the health department had zeroed in on a unit in Byndoor called Dhatri. “The company has assured us that they will prioritise local orders. The use of these kits, however, will depend on the number of Covid-19 patients that Udupi district records,” he added.Dr Bhat said that medical personnel attending to a patient required seven to 10 PPE kits on a daily basis. “Usually, one doctor and three nurses attend to a patient depending on the treatment being administered and the procedure. We use the safety gear when we have to collect samples from patients suspected of Covid-19.

17,['31/03/2020'],Karnataka: Clusterwise lockdown helped Kalaburagi contain spread,"KALABURAGI: For as many as 13 consecutive days after its third Covid-19 case was reported, Kalaburagi , the divisional headquarter of Kalayana Karnataka, has not witnessed any positive case. This has set the mood of optimism in the district that hogged the headlines in mid-March when the first death in India due to coronavirus infection was reported from the region.It appears that in the district, which was described as the epicentre of outbreak, the administration is successfully containing the spread of the virus. According to officials, unprecedented measures taken early on, much ahead of the nationwide lockdown , and relatively faster identification of primary and secondary contacts might have helped Kalaburagi tackle the situation effectively.Apart from two active cases and one death, no fresh cases have been reported from the district for 13 days straight. The last positive case reported was on March 17. It was felt that time bomb was ticking in the district with the doctor who treated the first case also testing positive. The situation now seems to be very much under control.Kalaburagi now has its own testing laboratory. Among the 100 samples dispatched for testing, 63 have shown negative, bringing a huge relief to people and the administration under the leadership of deputy commissioner Sharath B that has been fighting a tough battle since the outbreak.Health workers have extensively surveyed 7,827 houses till March 29. This is to be continued with the same rigour, said the officials. The authorities had locked down the cluster, besides sealing the district borders.Two containment zones were created — one where the 76-year-old man, the first positive patient, resided and another where the doctor who treated him lived. These containment zones were locked down, banning the movement of people. Nearly 2,000 people are under observation and 33 are in hospital isolation. Among these 743 with foreign travel history self-reported, highlighting community participation.Srinivas Kakkilaya, a Mangaluru-based medical practitioner, said Kalaburagi is perhaps showing the way by taking appropriate and timely measures to contain the spread of coronavirus. “Rather than nationwide lockdown, cluster or sector-wise quarantine is the need of the hour.

18,['31/03/2020'],Race against time to map footprint of ‘patient zero’,"PATNA: With Covid-19 positive cases rising steadily in Bihar — 15 in the past eight days, including one death — the health department and other agencies are racing against time to prevent the circle of infection from widening in the state.

The lone Covid-19 fatality in the state so far, a 38-year-old man from Munger who comes closest to being called the “patient zero” of Bihar, is alone responsible for infecting at least 10 people, including his 12-year-old nephew and a 35-year-old woman relative.

This man’s circle of infection is spread across his native Munger, neighbouring Lakhisarai and Bhagalpur as well as Patna where he had come for treatment. The state health department has identified 178 people so far who came in contact with the deceased Munger man, who He had returned from Qatar on March 12.

He tested positive after his death on March 21 at AIIMS- Patna. But by then, he had transmitted the virus to his nephew and the woman relative, who were the next two cases to turn positive. Later, it was found that three employees of a private hospital in Patna also tested positive for Covid-19.

The infection circle expanded to Lakhisarai, when the deceased’s sister-in-law, a 30-year-old woman tested positive for Covid-19 on late Saturday night. The next day on Sunday, four men who worked at a private hospital in Munger where the deceased had initially gone for treatment for kidney ailments tested positive for the virus.

“Swab and other samples of the first lot of 75 people were sent for test to Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences (RMRI), Patna. While 10 people have tested positive, reports of most others have come negative for Covid-19,” a senior health department official said.

Contact tracing of an infected person often involves scouring footage from CCTV cameras to find people who were infected with the virus by mapping the network of “patient zero” or the first person identified as Covid-19 positive.

“In the case of Munger man, we went through the CCTV footage of the private hospital in Patna and several other places, where he had gone. Many people were identified based on the footage and sent to quarantine,” health department additional secretary Kaushal Kishor told TOI on Monday.

Deliberating on the steps being taken to identify people who have come in contact with Covid-19 positive persons, Kishor said, “Apart from CCTV footage, we go by traditional interview as well, starting from immediate family members to people at the places visited by him. Sometime we are able to identify more people who came in contact with Covid-19 positive case within hours, while in other cases it takes several days.”

Identification apart, measures are also taken to quarantine entire areas where Covid-19 positive cases and contact cases are found. For instance, Khemnichak in Patna, where the private hospital in question is located, and five villages on Saran-Siwan border have been sealed.

“An area of three kilometers around the place, where Covid-19 positive case is found, is required to be quarantined, sanitized and sealed. House to house verification is done in this area for people with symptoms and surveillance officer also keep a strict vigil in the area,” Kishor said.

19,['31/03/2020'],Bihar: First AES death at SKMCH sets alarm bells ringing,"Representative image

PATNA: The death of a three-and-a half-year-old boy Aditya Kumar, due to Acute Encephalitis Syndrome ( AES ) at Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur on Sunday, has put the senior officials of the district administration and the health department on their toes.

Apparently alarmed over the first death this year, the district magistrate held a meeting with the officials of the district administration as well as health department on Saturday and issued necessary directives to check the spread of deadly disease in vulnerable areas.

Aditya’s mother Sonawati Devi had said that the boy was first admitted to a primary health centre at Sakra after he complained of high fever, convulsion and body ache on Thursday. “The boy was put on ventilator for three days but couldn’t survive. In fact, he was brought here by the family members after his condition deteriorated. The doctors tried their level best but couldn’t save him,” said SKMCH superintendent Dr SK Shahi.

Shahi, however, said that another five-year-old girl, who was referred to the SKMCH from Motihari sadar hospital in East Champaran district with similar complications, was released from the hospital on Sunday. “Though her sugar level was also recorded much low, she responded to the treatment well and survived,” he said.

The superintendent, however, admitted that a few suspected AES cases were reported earlier too but there was no casualty.

The DM said that the administrative officials of the blocks, which had earlier witnessed AES cases, have been told to take precautionary measures. Awareness campaigns have also been launched in villages asking people not to allow their children to move in the scorching sun, feed them well at night and prevent them from eating unripe or rotten fruits from orchards.

The most important thing is that children with symptoms of AES should be admitted to either nearby PHC or the SKMCH without any delay. “If the victim is provided treatment within one or two hours, there are 99% chances of survival in such cases. The delay in treatment, however, may prove fatal,” he added.

The DM said that the relatives of the victim reaching the hospital on hiring private vehicles were given Rs.400 immediately and the patients were provided treatment free of cost. He further said that the administration was trying to restart the construction of 100-bed PICU ward at the SKMCH, which has stopped after the outbreak of Covid-19.

He, however, said that the PICU at the SKMCH was fully equipped to deal with AES cases. Even doctors and para-medical staff deputed at the PHCs in the district have been imparted training to deal with such cases. “PICUs have been made operational at all the PHCs in the district,” the DM said.

“As of today, there is no case of AES at the SKMCH Dr Shahi said. Earlier, CM Nitish Kumar assessed the preparedness of the authorities concerned to tackle the AES cases in Muzaffarpur and its adjoining districts at a high level meeting in Patna and issued directives to complete the 100-bed PICU ward at the SKMCH at the earliest.

Principal Neelam Singh told this newspaper, “Our teachers are preparing videos and have even completed the first two chapters of their respective subjects. They are also giving home assignments to the students.”St Karen’s High School, Litera Valley School and Bishop Scott Group of Schools have also begun virtual classes in order to complete the syllabi on time.Bishop Scott Group director Shailesh Kumar said, “We have been conducting online classes in all our four schools since March 28.”Other schools, which have not gone virtual, are making all necessary arrangements for the purpose and training their teachers.Dr D Y Patil Pushpalata Patil International School director C B Singh said, “Students of classes III to XII will attend five-hour long classes for six days a week from April and get home assignments. Their attendance will also be marked.”He added, “Most of our teachers will use the ‘Zoom’ mobile app for conducting online classes. Others will use the ‘Diksha’ portal of the Central Board of Secondary Education.”While St Xavier’s High School is upgrading its in-house software to start online classes, Notre Dame Academy, Loyola High School, Delhi Public School, St Joseph’s Convent High School and St Michael’s High School are busy planning their timetables.Even before the lockdown was announced, St Michael’s Primary School asked its teachers to prepare a list of home assignments and day-to-day activities for the students.Headmistress Vishakha Sinha said, “I had sent a note to all the parents in this connection on March 21. Teachers first give their assignment plans to me and I share them with the parents. They, in turn, make sure that kids complete their work on time. When the school reopens, we will carry out revision work.”Meanwhile, students, most of whom are technophiles, have hailed the online classes. Aarti Kumari, a resident of Rajiv Nagar, said, “I sit with my daughter to make sure that she is attentive.

KOLKATA: Many people have found an opportunity amidst the crisis presented by the lockdown and their enterprise has become a lifeline for many in several neighbourhoods in the city. With markets getting crowded and people being restricted to their homes, mobile vendors selling anything from veggies to bread and butter, from fruits to even puri and sabzi, have come to the rescue of several households.

Mobile vendors with items loaded on cycle-vans, push-carts or even tempos have become a common sight and several families have taken the vendors’ numbers to find out when they will be servicing their localities every day. Such is the demand that by the time the vendors get done for the day, almost the entire stock is sold.

Many vendors TOI spoke to — who worked in transport or eateries and were left without jobs when the lockdown was announced — said they wasted no time in diversifying to fill the gap.

“I pick up vegetables from Koley Market and do the rounds in areas close to Ganesh Chandra Avenue and Wellesley. Transport options are shut and I am out of work, but I have to feed my family,” said Sanjay Paswan, a vendor.

Mohammad Irshad Sheikh, 62, worked at a restaurant off Central Avenue, which is now shut. Last Thursday, when he found out there was scarcity of bread in central Kolkata, he took his bicycle to a bakery on Rippon Street and picked up loaves to sell there. He said now people call him the night before to place orders. “I reach the bakery by 5am and head to BB Ganguly Street, Eden Hospital Road, Tara Chand Dutta Street, Kaviraj Row and Central Avenue. I sell everything by 9am,” he said.

Central Kolkata has a huge population of migrant labourers who are facing difficulty in getting food. Apart from them, most people who buy from these vendors are the elderly, those who want to avoid crowded markets and those who cannot afford to buy in bulk. “Going to markets will defeat the purpose of social distancing.

22,['31/03/2020'],Chaiti Chhath: Many offer ‘arghya’ at home,"PATNA: Patnaites offered ‘arghya’ to the setting Sun on Day 3 of Chaiti Chhath on Wednesday. Most of them stayed indoors in view of the countrywide lockdown due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

The third day of Chaiti Chhath, when ‘sandhya arghya’ is offered, usually witnesses huge gatherings of people. This time, however, many did not celebrate the festival.

Around 300 people used to visit Kankarbagh resident Vishal Singh’s house on the occasion of Chaiti Chhath every year. “We offered ‘sandhya arghya’ with only five people this year. I missed my friends, but am, anyway, happy that I was able to celebrate the festival with my family. There were no fruits and the rituals were performed using dry fruits and coconuts,” he told this newspaper.

He added, “I made my brother and sister-in-law see the rituals through videoconferencing.”

Another devotee, Munni Devi of Nala Road area, celebrated the festival without her children this time.

“No video or phone call can fill the void a mother feels when her kids are not around. I was not even willing to celebrate Chhath, but my family convinced me to. I prayed for the betterment of the world,” she said.

Ghats barricaded: Amid the 21-day lockdown, the district administration has barricaded the Bans Ghat, Mahendru Ghat, Collectorate Ghat, Krishna Ghat, Gandhi Ghat, Law College Ghat, Mahavir Ghat and Sita Ghat to prevent crowding.

In a statement issued by the administration, Patna district magistrate Kumar Ravi says, “A large number of police personnel have been deputed at the ghats and told to prevent crowding. If a ‘vrati’ reaches a ghat, the authorities will ensure that they follow social distancing.”

Market players said that fears about a sharp decline in economic growth due to issues relating to Covid-19 , including a humanitarian crisis because of the reverse migration of labour force, weighed on investor sentiment. This led to the sharp spike in selling in the new week.On the NSE , the Nifty settled at 8,281 points, down 279 points or 4.4%. On the BSE , investors saw their wealth erode by about Rs 2.5 lakh crore with the stock exchange’s market capitalisation now reduced to Rs 108.7 lakh crore.Religare Broking VP (research) Ajit Mishra said the sell-off in the Indian markets spiked due to the rising risk of community transmission of coronavirus as the total number of cases in the country crossed the 1,100 mark. “Besides, the lockdown in the major cities has also started showing its impact and top think tanks are now vocal about the strong possibility of further contraction in growth numbers if the curfew continues longer than expected,” Mishra said in a note.On the sectoral front, the BFSI sector led the slide, along with auto and real estate, while pharma and FMCG stocks showed some resilience. Among the sensex stocks, HDFC, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Bank and RIL were top drags on the index, while HUL and Nestle supported it, BSE data showed.During the session, foreign funds were net sellers at Rs 4,364 crore, while domestic institutions recorded a net buying figure of Rs 3,550 crore, BSE data showed.

The promoters are clueless on when the bank’s Initial public offering (IPO) will hit the market.

“We are in a 21-day lockdown and nothing can be done now,” said PN Vasudevan, MD and CEO of ESFB, who has already missed the first deadline to list the bank last September.

Under the RBI’s regulatory requirements, after a small finance bank reaches the net worth of Rs 500 crore, listing will be mandatory within three years of reaching that net worth. For small finance banks having net worth of below Rs 500 crore could also get their shares listed voluntarily, subject to fulfilment of the requirements of the capital markets regulator. In case of Equitas Small Finance Bank, the deadline was on or before September 4, 2019, which was extended to March 31.

“There is no clarity if this 21-day lockdown will extend or not. In such a case, how do we plan to list the bank,” Vasudevan asked.

With fears of the Covid-19 pandemic escalating, Indian migrant workers, mostly from East, West Champaran, Gopalganj and Siwan trekked to the Birgunj-Raxaul border. Many hitch-hiked from Pokhara and Mankaamna temple hub on the Muglin-Kathmandu highway.“ We arranged for bread and biscuits for the tired, forlorn working class Indians stuck at the border, but the authorities did not allow the distribution and the food items were returned,” social activist Mahesh Agarwal in Raxaul rued. “Over 2,000 fatigued migrants just squatted on the road,” he said over phone.“Many went for their morning ablutions on the banks of the Sariswa rivulet running through the No-Man’s land between the borders on either side,” Agarwal further said, adding, “About 500 fled wading through the water and successfully made a run to home ground though the porous borderline. Many others, familiar with the borderline topography, moved eastward from the gated border and slipped in through places like Bhelwa, Pantokha, Ahirwa tola, Adapur and Chaura Daano.”Raxaul SDM, meanwhile, said they were no more than a few hundred people who turned up at the border on Nepal side. However, the SDM’s claims were belied by the afternoon when hundreds of such migrants reached and cut through Motihari, the headquarters of East Champaran district.“We hitched rides on tankers but mostly walked,” said Ravi Kant, who worked in a hotel at Pokhara and crossed Motihari on way to his native Hardia village in Kotwa block.Others like Shyama Kant, Girija and Pathalu were part of a 16 strong group from Pokhara who, after breaching the sealed border, had reached Motihari on their way back home. Kamlesh Kumar from Kotwa and Ravi from Areraj were returning from the Mankaamna temple complex where they worked in a hotel nearby.East Champaran DM Shirsat Kapil Ashok said the lockdown has to be maintained at the border. “I have spoken to consul-general Nitesh Kumar, who is setting up a relief and medical camp for Indian citizens stuck at Birgunj.

PATNA: Three days after lauding him for announcing Rs100 crore relief package for the migrant workers and the destitute in Bihar, poll strategist and former JD(U) national vice-president Prashant Kishor on Monday demanded Bihar CM Nitish Kumar to step down for mismanagement in handling people returning from other states.“Another frightening picture of state government’s efforts for saving people from Covid-19 infection. Such arrangements made by Nitish Kumar for social distancing and quarantine for people returning to the state from all over the country after facing much hardship is heart-rending. Nitish must quit (sic),” Kishor tweeted.Kishor has also tagged a video clip in which many people can be seen locked inside a facility and one of them is crying for going home in Siwan. “We are locked here for past five years. We reached here after lots of hardship and the officials here are saying that they are arranging buses but no vehicle has come so far for taking us,” the man is heard saying while crying.JD(U) functionaries lashed out at Kishor for his statement. “He cannot mislead people. Bihar was the first state to introduce lockdown. Steps were initiated through resident commissioner in Delhi to trace and help migrant workers from Bihar across the country. Various welfare schemes were also taken, including advance disbursement of pension, three months scholarship to students from standard 1 to 12 and setting up disaster relief centres for homeless people in urban areas among others,” JD(U) spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said, adding that Kishor should rather question the Arvind Kejriwal government for not being able to handle the migrant labourers in Delhi.Earlier on March 26, Kishor had hailed the Bihar government for helping migrant labours. “After all the public outcry, government of Bihar has announced new measures to help daily wage workers an poor people stranded across India due to the lockdown. This includes additional fund of Rs100 crore from CM Relief Fund.

29,['31/03/2020'],"RIL donates Rs 500 crore to PM’s fund, ONGC contributes Rs 300 crore","MUMBAI: As coronavirus cases rise in the country, more and more companies are coming forward with monetary and other packages to help the government in its preventive and rescue operations against the pandemic. And those that have already announced support are enhancing their commitments.

Reliance Industries ( RIL ), which last week announced the setting up of India’s first 100-bed dedicated Covid-19 hospital in Mumbai, said on Monday that it has donated Rs 500 crore to the Prime Minister’s relief fund. This makes the energy-to-education enterprise the largest corporate contributor to the emergency relief fund launched by PM Narendra Modi last week.

Besides RIL, PSU oil producer ONGC donated Rs 300 crore to the relief fund instituted by the Centre. ONGC’s contribution is the biggest support offered by a PSU in India’s ongoing fight against the virus onslaught.

Engineering giant Larsen & Toubro and government-owned miner NMDC too pledged Rs 150 crore each to the relief fund while Ahmedabad-based Torrent, New Delhi-located Hero and Bengaluru-headquartered Infosys committed Rs 100 crore each to various Covid-19 relief initiatives with half of the sum going to the newly formed PM’s citizen assistance fund.

Coronavirus cases have crossed the 1,200 mark even as the nation is in the midst of a three-week economic and social lockdown. The corporate commitments are increasing while the ongoing lockdown impacts businesses hugely.

TVS Group, which last week announced a Rs 30-crore support for supply of masks and tractors fitted with disinfectant spray, said on Monday that it will donate an additional Rs 25 crore to the PM’s relief fund. Contributions to the PM’s relief fund are exempted from income tax and qualify as CSR expenditure that companies are mandated to make.

Besides donations, these companies are providing ventilators among other medical devices (which are currently in shortage) and offering their hostels, guesthouses, training centres and hospitals as quarantine centres to ease the pressure on government-run medical facilities.

L&T has also set aside Rs 500 crore per month to support 1.60 lakh contract workers by continuing to pay their wages during the ongoing lockdown. The shutdown has dried up jobs in cities for rural migrants, which form a large chunk of the country’s workforce, forcing them to walk miles to head back to their homes. The Shapoorji Pallonji Group also announced that it will take care of its 70,000-plus migrant workers.

Further, Mumbai-based Mankind Pharma has donated Rs 51 crore to Covid-19 relief funds, while Asian Paints has committed Rs 35 crore. Medicine-maker Hetero, textile-to-power group LNJ Bhilwara and financial services firm IIFL too contributed Rs 10 crore, Rs 6 crore and Rs 5 crore to the said schemes, respectively.

36,['31/03/2020'],"Employees use free time to upskill, learn new tech","Namrata Singh & Aparna Desikan | TNN

Mumbai/Chennai: In these unprecedented Covid-19 times, when India Inc is challenged by factory shutdowns in several sectors, there’s one aspect that’s remained unaffected — learning and development (L&D). With work-from-home (WFH) becoming the norm, professionals are making the most of their extra time indoors by enhancing their skills and capabilities.

Digital learning platforms are witnessing a spike in enrolments. UpGrad has recorded an increase of 30-35% in enrolments in the last couple of weeks for professional and individual learners. “We have also seen 50% higher leads from individuals in this period,” said UpGrad co-founder Mayank Kumar.

Great Learning co-founder Hari Krishnan Nair said, “We are receiving tens of thousands of visitors daily on free learning resources. Content consumption for our learning programmes is seeing a 3x increase week on week.” Most of the surge is coming from metro cities with increased enquiries from cities such as Pune, Noida and Kochi.

At Simplilearn, sales professionals whose job role entailed being in the field are now taking up learning. “There is also a 20% jump in enrolment from individual learners for data science,” said CEO and co-founder Krishna Kumar.

Corporate India, which usually draws up an L&D calendar for the year starting April, is also shifting to virtual modes to ensure there’s continuity in learning. Siemens, for instance, is encouraging its employees to enhance their competencies through a digital platform, which the company has launched. Siemens India MD & CEO Sunil Mathur said, “Continuous learning is an essential ingredient and integral part of every employee’s development in Siemens. With the speed at which technology changes, it is imperative for each one of our employees to ensure, for their own development, that they are continuously updated on the nuances of each new innovation. At this time, when all our employees are working from home, we are encouraging them to further their competencies through the launch of ‘My Growth’, a unique digital platform. It combines the power of two levers — ‘My Learning World’ and ‘Own your Career’ — for holistic individual learning and development.”

There are two kinds of learning. One is instructor-led, which either takes place in person or virtually. This is preferred for leadership and behavioural learning and development. The second is self-placed learning, which — along with virtual instructor-led learning — is preferred for technical, functional and professional learning. Self-placed learning can be taken according to the participant’s schedule.

At Siemens, employees are encouraged to use the multiple offerings of self-paced, virtual instructor-led sessions, and from simulated war rooms to digital immersions on a variety of topics through the digital learning platform.

RPG Group head (organisation & talent development) Syed Azfar Hussain said, “Most of our L&D has moved online. Earlier in the year, after employees created their development action plans, learning programmes and other learning assets were assigned to them. We had drawn up an L&D calendar for the next financial year, beginning in April. Because of the Covid-19 outbreak, all in-person instructor-led programmes have been moved to June-July. Nearly all (85%) technical/functional L&D programmes are progressing through virtual instructor-led and self-paced methodology.”

A combination of both internal as well as external faculty is used to enable L&D. “For behavioural learning, we are trying to replace in-person with self-paced content. However, in leadership learning, it’s difficult to do this without compromising effectiveness. This may get postponed to June-July. Our coaching and mentoring programmes are also going on as scheduled and are not impacted because these can be entirely done virtually,” said Hussain.

Capstone People Consulting’s learning and organisational development round-table is offering ‘webinars’ on reinventing in times of adversity, which are attended by up to 300 professionals. Capstone People Consulting CEO Sujaya Banerjee said, “Keeping the learning curve steep is key in times of adversity. We are working with many of our clients to enable their employees to use this downtime meaningfully for reflection, internalising new insights for thinking differently and arming themselves with the best thought leadership to combat new challenges and difficulties we are likely to encounter on the other side.”

KOLKATA: If you find vegetables heavy on the pocket now, don’t just blame it on hoarding by unscrupulous traders during the lockdown. The ground reality is a little different. TOI had earlier reported how potatoes were rotting in fields in North Bengal as farmers were unable to find transport to send the produce to wholesalers. Now, fields in West and East Midnapore, Hooghly, and North and South 24 Parganas are suffering the same fate.The farmers there have been forced to harvest only a small part of their produce — only the quantity they know they can sell in local markets where they can ferry it on cycle vans. The remainder has been left to rot in the fields.“Had times been normal, I would have harvested the entire produce and sent it to Kolkata. But now there are no trains or trucks plying. How much can I send on small goods carriers like motor vans?” asked Gobinda Phatik of Shibhati village in Gatbeta, West Midnapore.However, farmers in Hooghly’s Nalikul, Dankuni, Dhaniakhali, Singur and Chanditala say they are earning a good profit on whatever they manage to send to Kolkata.“We have divided ourselves into groups of seven to eight farmers and loading vegetables from each of our fields on small goods carriers. From Hooghly, we head to Tandelbagan, where some of us offload a small quantity for sale in Howrah. Most of the vegetables are then taken to Kolkata. I am getting a very good price for my produce. I was selling ridge gourd for Rs 30 a kg in our local market. But in Kolkata, I got Rs 50,” said Prasanta Khan of Nalikul.Farmers and agriculture department officials in East and West Burdwan said they were keeping fingers crossed and hoping to find labourers to harvest paddy by the end of April.

38,['31/03/2020'],Lockdown hits transgenders hard in Bihar,"PATNA: Members of transgender community are facing one of the worst crises in their lives due to nationwide lockdown .

The community members depend on daily earnings through ‘badhai’ visits to families on auspicious occasions like child birth, marriage and a few other holy occasions. Nowadays, their source of income has dried up as they can’t move out.

“Our community members have reached on the verge of starvation as they have been earning nothing since ‘janata curfew’ on March 22,” transgender activist Reshma Prasad told TOI on Monday.

According to Reshma, there are around 40,000 transgenders in Bihar. Of them, around 2,500 live in Patna district alone and only 60 to 70 live with their biological families.

“Most of the transgenders reside in groups with their ‘guru’ in different localities of the state capital. Most of them live in rented accommodations. Some of them live in slum areas as they have low income. Their main source of income is through ‘Badhai’ visits or dance performance. Around 800 to 900 members residing in the state capital are solely dependent on the Badhai earnings,” Reshma, who is also the secretary of Dostana Safar, a community based social organization, told TOI.

“As they are following the government’s guidelines during the lockdown, their only source of income has dried up,” said another transgender activist Anupriya Singh. “Those living with ‘gharana’ of their gurus are worst sufferers, as they cannot move out due to the lockdown,” Singh said.

Santosh Guru, who heads a family of around 20 transgender people in Mithapur area, said, “When people are not coming out of their homes, to whom we will seek financial assistance. In the last seven days, we spent whatever little savings we had. With no concrete help coming from the government side, we are now on the verge of starvation,” she said over the phone.

“We live in a rented house at Mithapur and pay Rs5,000 per month. In general days, we cook meals ourselves. Sometimes we take meals at roadside eateries. Due to lockdown, all eateries are now closed. We are running our kitchens by taking grocery items on credit from nearby shops. If the grocery shopowner stops giving us credit, we will die of starvation,” Santosh said.

“With the assistance of Dostana safar, the Bihar Electric Traders’ Association on last Friday distributed packets of grocery items among the community members. But such assistance is not enough. More social organizations should come forward to help out the community members,” said Dimple Jasmine, another transgender activist.

39,['31/03/2020'],Karnataka: Bootleggers thrive as liquor outlets remain shut,"Picture used for representational purpose only

MYSURU: With the liquor outlets and pubs closing its doors on consumers in the wake of Prime Minister’s call for 21-day lockdown, a parallel grey foreign liquor market is thriving in the state.

Although the state government shut down all kinds of liquor shops, bars and restaurants till March 31 to check the spread of novel corona virus, the closure has encouraged the illegal sale of liquor in many places and paved a way for bootleggers to make fast buck.

“Liquor is being sold in grocery shops illegally in rural areas of the district. In some parts of the city, people had to cough up more than double the standard price for booze being sold illegally,” said a resident of T Narasipura taluk.

However, excise officials has denied the allegation. “Police and the department officials will initiate legal action against illegal sale of liquor. If anyone is seen violating the order, their license will be terminated,” said an excise department official.

This is the first instance in the recent years the liquor stores in the state were closed for more than a week. The closure of liquor outlets had brought cheers among women as well activists after a steep fall in alcohol-induced anti-social activities. Cases of miscreants indulging in random acts of violence had also dropped considerably following the lockdown, claimed police sources.

The district has 558 wholesale and retail liquor shops, including military canteens, pubs, star hotels, clubs, bars attached to restaurants and wine stores. Over 200 of them are retail shops (CL 2 license holders), followed by 17 clubs (CL 4), 3 star hotels, 134 boarding and lodging (CL 70), 138 bar and restaurants(CL 9), 30 MSIL outlets (CL 11), military canteens (CL 8), 32 wine stores and other shops.

Mysuru district is second highest revenue fetching division after Bengaluru to the government in excise sales and orders, said excise department officials.

13 special team formed to check illegal liquor sale

Speaking to TOI, deputy commissioner (excise) K Murali said the department has constituted 13 special team, including five teams in city limits, to check bootlegging in the district.

“If anyone is found selling in grocery store, they will be arrested, cases will be booked and penalised. The department has not yet received any communication from the government regarding the relaxation for liquor shops after March 31 also,” he said.

The big cats, which were under tremendous pressure due to regular movement of safari vehicles and disturbances caused by tourists, are now freely prowling in their respective territories.The state has five tiger reserves – Nagarahole National Park, Bandipur Tiger Reserve, Male (Malai) Mahadeshwara Wildlife Sanctuary, Biligiri Ranganathaswamy Temple Tiger Reserve (both in Chamarajanagar district), Badra Tiger Reserve (Chikkamagaluru district) and Kali Tiger Reserve (at Dandeli in Shivamogga district).The reserves together house 524 tigers and 6,049 elephants as per the latest census.“Heavy movement of safari vehicles and tourists, especially during weekends in Bandipur and Nagarahole, has caused lot of stress on the tigers. Such stress reduces the life span of wild animals in the reserves,” said Krithika Alanahally, wildlife warden of Mysuru.“The ban on vehicles has also reduced air and noise pollution and brought incidents of road kills to zero. The forest officers and staff can now concentrate more on monitoring the forest to prevent any fire incidents and poaching activities,” she said.While safari has been banned in the reserves, the government has also restricted regular vehicle movements inside the forests, allowing only goods vehicles carrying essential items and other emergency vehicles to pass through the check-posts.Bandipur conservator of forests and field director, project tiger, T Balachandra told TOI that wild animals are very happy after the ban on vehicles.“We see animals, especially elephants, deers, sambars, leopards and others on the roads resting and roaming freely without any disturbance. There is a ban on public carriers and only vehicles carrying essential goods like milk, vegetables and ambulances are allowed to cross the check-posts. Meanwhile, we are vigilant to prevent fire and poaching activities. All the forest ranges have received light rainfall and another one or two showers will ensure that there will be no fire incident this summer,” he said.Male (Malai) Mahadeshwara Wildlife Sanctuary, which houses nearly 20 tigers, is all set to be declared as Male (Malai) Mahadeshwara Hills Tiger Reserve.Speaking to TOI, DCF V Yedukondalu said that all check-posts are closed and only emergency vehicles are allowed.“Animals are happy and sleep on the road.

41,['31/03/2020'],"Hunger, not corona, will kill us: Bihar migrant workers","Passengers who have arrived from different states Migrant workers leave in overloaded buses at near Mithapur b... Read More

PATNA: “Coronavirus hame khak marega. Hum to mar chuke hain, saheb. Char-panch dinon se bhukha pyasa hain. Pair mein chhale par gaye hain. Ab chala nahi ja raha hai. Sanse ukhad rahi hain,” this is how a 45-year-old migrant worker, Md Irshad, narrated his tale at a check post at Bihar-UP border in Gopalganj district on Monday.

Irshad, a resident of Bettiah in West Champaran district, reached from Delhi to go to his native place. He worked at a leather bag manufacturing unit in the national capital. Irshad had departed from Delhi with a group of seven people after the factory was shut following nationwide lockdown.

Irshad said he left for home with Rs 700, which his employer had given him. The story of his journey from Delhi to Kushinagar in UP, close to Gopalganj in Bihar, is heart rendering. “We spent night in the open without food. At some places, we hired autorickshaws and ‘jugad gadi’ to reach Kushinagar. However, we mostly walked on foot,” he said.

Most members of the group led by Irshad had not been able to contact their family for the last two days. “Our cellphones have stopped working. The battery is very low. We are worried about our family members as they are waiting for us at home,” he said.

Irshad is not alone. Around 15,000 migrant workers from Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra have arrived on the Bihar-UP border in Gopalganj, Siwan and Saran districts during the last 24 hours. They are in a hurry to reach their homes as the government has banned the entry of buses and other modes of transportation completely.

In Araria, adequate arrangements are being made to quarantine and provide food to all workers returning from different states. “Around 80 workers have arrived at Narpatganj and 40 at Bhargama. We are making all efforts to manage their stay and keep them in isolation for 14 days before they are allowed to leave for their homes,” Araria DM Prashant Kumar C H said.

Altogether 41 people were kept in isolation cell in Araria district. However, none of them was found positive. A six-page home quarantine diary is being issued to each quarantined person, so that the affected one or the source person – the carrier of Covid-19 – could be detected. The diary holders have to write the names and cellphone numbers of the people they were in contact with in the last 15 days.

In Nawada, despite the district administrations’ ceaseless efforts to tackle the huge influx of migrant workers, arrangements to get them medically examined and provide them with timely food did not go as planned.

Bablu Mandal (23), worker at a pulse mill in West Bengal and a native of Naugachia in Bhagalpur, who was put up at the isolation centre at ITI grounds besides NH-31 three days ago, alleged that the doctors have not examined him yet. DM Yashpal Meena and SP Hari Prasath were seen handling the huge number of migrants who have arrived from Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand at Chitrkoli along Jharkhand border.

In Gaya, 43 Jamui-bound workers, who came from Allahabad, have been quarantined at Nigma monastery in Bodh Gaya. DM Abhishek Singh visited the monastery on Monday and inspected the facilities. The DM directed the officials concerned to religiously follow the quarantine protocol.

42,['31/03/2020'],"Liquor mafia, boozers having a field day during lockdown","VARANASI: At a time when people are struggling to arrange even essential commodities during the ongoing nationwide lockdown in view of COVID-19 threat, the liquor mafia in the region as well as boozers are having a field day.

Only in past four days, the cops in Varanasi and surrounding districts have not only witnessed the menace of liquor mafia pumping in huge consignments of liquor in the neighbouring dry state of Bihar, but also cases of black marketing of liquor and even theft in liquor shops have kept them on their toes.

On March 28 late night, a band of thieves breached the rear wall of a country liquor shop in Nandpur area under the limits of Kapsethi police station in Varanasi and fled with 20 boxes full of 180 ml bottles. After the matter came to light on March 30 morning the owner of building in which the shop is located reported the matter to the police.

Before it on March 27 SP Sonbhadra Ashish Srivastava led an operation of district police in which three smuggled liquor-laden truck were stoppd near Khairahi on Sonbhadra-Mirzapur highway. When the containers of trucks were checked secret cavities were detected. The liquor smugglers had hidden bottles containing 72,226.64 litres of branded liquor packed in 825 boxes in the cavities.

Srivastava said, “Following their arrest the drivers of three truck including Rajesh, Jagmendra of Haryana and Shivnath of Bihar divulged that the liquor consignment had been given to them by some Sonu at Sonipat in Haryana to deliver at Muzaffarpur in Bihar.”

He said that apart from liquor three trucks and mobile phones of drivers had been seized.

Again on March 27, the Badagaon cops, who were patrolling Siswa fruit market to ensure proper enforcement of lockdown, in Varanasi caught a person engaged in black marketing of the liquor. A total of 19 bottles of liquor were recovered from his possession.

District excise officer Varanasi Karunendra Singh said, ”With the promulgation of lockdown, a blanket ban is imposed on sale of liquor. The current financial year is ending on Tuesday, but due to lockdown since March 25 no process of counting of old stock could take place so far. We are waiting for the order of state government to initiate this process and also decide the timing for the regularisation of the shops for next financial year.”

He said that his department was also investigating the issue.

44,['31/03/2020'],They are delivering goods by keeping trains on tracks,"Nagpur: At a time when the country is completely lockdown owing to the coronavirus pandemic and people are mostly staying indoors, these railwaymen are at the forefront to ensure that freight services remain uninterrupted for essential supplies.

In the last two days, the Indian Railways loaded 71,261 freight wagons — 48,614 had essential commodities while 22,647 contained other important items. The list included foodgrains, sugar, salt, edible oil, coal and petroleum products.

Those keeping the trains on the tracks include running and passing staff, controllers and the ones who still remain on the field for asset management. These lockdown heroes are the loco pilots, their assistants and guards, station masters, pointsman, controllers and trackmen. Their jobs are interlinked.

“Freight trains have no normal timetable and there is no surety when we will return home. Keeping our concentration on the tracks for long hours and then maintaining family responsibilities is the toughest job. Though we are getting rid of human interface, the pandemic is always on our minds and we are delivering the goods by taking all the necessary precautions,” a section of loco pilots told TOI.

“The railways is taking precaution by not using breath analyser at the time of signing in and signing out. Our loco is also sanitized. With passenger trains off the tracks, the workload has gone down but the responsibility is always there. Last week, I drove an oil tanker rake and two coal rakes which were needed to be transported in time,” a loco pilot said.

Talking to TOI, South East Central Railway (SECR) divisional commercial manager (DCM) Anurag Singh, said, “Though loco pilots have a major role to play, the job of controllers, station masters, pointsman, trackmen cannot be seconded in the movement of trains. Those who maintain the OHE lines are equally important. Even if passenger trains are withdrawn, 55-60 freight trains are being operated in the division for which staff is on the field.”

In SECR, 50% of the over 3,000 cadre of civil engineering, operating, signalling, mechanical and electrical departments are at work. Similarly, the cadre of around 800 loco pilots and 400 guards is utilized similarly. The SECR division extends up to Durg while Central Railway reaches Itarsi, Ballarshah and Badnera.

“We are utilizing the services of 1250 loco pilots, 8 controllers, 400 station masters, 200 guards and 350 pointsman. Of the 4,000 trackmen, the services of 1,500 are used on a rotation basis. Unlike a gang of 15-20 earlier, now a group of 7 are maintaining the tracks with complete social distancing. We are not calling women employees,” said Central Railway spokesperson & ACM, SG Rao.

SECR’s Singh said controllers are the brains behind the movement of rail traffic within their section. It includes arranging crossing of trains, efficient utilization of wagons and formation of goods trains at junction stations.

“In the lockdown period, if a coal rake needs precedence to maintain supplies for power generation then other freight trains will get second preference,” said a controller.

“We are working like soldiers to supply essential commodities. There are no fixed duty hours and no specific stations where the train stops. Our brake van cabin has no lights and only a steel chair to sit on. Positioned at the rear, it gives terrible jerks when the train starts and stops,” they said.

“Even as most of the people and those working in the railways are indoors owing to lockdown, the loco pilots, guards, station masters, controllers and trackmen are the real heroes who have been standing tall despite the Covid-19 scare,” says SK Shukla, vice-president of the All India Guards Council (AIGC).

It also extended the deadline for regulatory filing for alternate investment and venture capital funds till April 30 and also extended the second phase of UPI implementation for retail investors till further notice.In its circular on the ratings decision, Sebi said that in view of the three-month moratorium/deferment on payment permitted by the RBI, “a differentiation in treatment of default, on a case-to-case basis, needs to be made as to whether such default occurred solely due to the lockdown or loan moratorium. Accordingly, based on its assessment, if the CRA is of the view that the delay in payment of interest/principal has arisen solely due to the lockdown conditions…CRAs may not consider the same as a default event and/or recognise default.”This has been done to align Sebi’s guidelines along with the relaxations given by the RBI, market players said.

48,['31/03/2020'],"No more queues, all bank branches in West Bengal to remain open","Customers queue up outside a bank on Monday

KOLKATA: In keeping with the latest directive from the State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC), all bank branches in the state have been asked to resume normal operations — for full banking hours till 4pm — from Monday. However, the circular has put bank employees and officers in a fix as no transport arrangement has been made to ferry them to and from their offices during the 21-day lockdown. Additionally, many bank staffers are worried that regular contact with customers, especially during the first few days of the new-month rush, could prove to be hazardous for them.

The SLBC circular said all bank branches, irrespective of location, will remain open till 4pm on all working days and all ATMs will function 24x7. They will be replenished with cash on a regular basis.

Sikha Das, a savings account holder at United Bank of India (UBI) who waited in queue for three hours on Monday, said this decision will be of huge relief to many like her.

“I have been running from one branch to another since last week just to withdraw Rs 2,000. Most of the time I was told that either the cashier or the manager was absent. I was helpless as my son doesn’t stay here and my husband is paralysed,” Das told TOI outside the Haridevpur branch.

Another customer, S K Ghosh, complained about the serpentine queues in front of branches. “Eventually, cops had to intervene to open a single counter at the branch I visited,” he said.

However, the general secretary of Bengal Provincial Bank Employees’ Association (BPBEA), Rajen Nagar, reasoned that there were 12,000 branches in the state and it was not easy to man them fully at this juncture when public transport was not available. “We have told the banks that employees, except for those who stay near the offices, need to be given transportation facilities. Apart from that, sanitization of branches and social distancing norms have to be followed,” he added.

Avijit Roy, a senior bank employee at the SBI’s Bangur branch, comes to work from Barasat. “I travel on my two-wheeler every day, but many of my colleagues had to skip work in absence of public transport,” he said.

The former deputy chief secretary of SBI Staff Association, Ashok Mukherjee, said that along with customers, safety of the bank staffers was also of great importance.

Nagar pointed out that a lot of customers may come to their branches in the next six-seven days for pension, NREGA payments and other reasons. “We have to ensure social distancing in the offices,” he added.

Sailen Das, a customer at an SBI branch in Howrah, however, lauded the efforts taken in the short-staffed branch. “In the branch that I visit, the employees took adequate care of all customers and ensured that the social distancing rules were followed,” he said.

49,['31/03/2020'],Stranded migrant workers take long walk back home,"Migrant daily wage earners in the city on their way back home

Visakhapatnam: Migrant daily wage workers in Visakhapatnam city are taking the long way back home. Faced with the closure of commercial establishments amid the 21-day lockdown and fears of a loss of livelihood and the conditions back home, many of them, from Chhattisgarh and Odisha , have decided to walk home.

While authorities at the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) have made arrangements for accommodation and food for stranded daily wage earners, many have instead chosen the risk of crossing interstate borders over the uncertainty of remaining in the city as supply of essential items runs low.

Anil Kumar, part of a team from the Ramakrishna Mission in Visakhapatnam said, “We scouted for some people who might have been stranded on the highway and picked up five people, two of whom were on their way to Vizianagaram towm, another to Odisha and two more to Chattisgarh. We dropped them at the Anandapuram junction, while insisting all along that they return to Vizag, where they would be provided food and shelter.”

The team from Ramakrishna Mission also provided food and water to the workers who insisted on walking home. The GVMC commissioner had also been informed about the situation, they said.

The migrant workers will have to trek across the hilly Andhra-Odisha border in order to avoid border checkposts. They will also be stopped for checks at every major town they pass through and the Konavalasa checkpost in AP and Sunki checkpost in Odisha.

50,['31/03/2020'],Delhi Corona News: Delhi could use Jawahar Lal Nehru stadium to shelter labourers,"The JLN stadium has 150 beds at its hostel facility located indoors (File photo)

NEW DELHI: With Covid-19 cases in the national capital on the rise, Delhi government has stepped up its fight against the pandemic by turning the city’s biggest sports arena – the Jawahar Lal Nehru (JLN) stadium at Lodhi Road – into a quarantine facility with “immediate effect” to house affected people.

This is the second instance and first in the city where a sports facility is being used to quarantine suspected coronavirus patients. Earlier, Sports Authority of India (SAI) had handed over its boxing training facility in Rohtak to the Haryana government to set up an isolation facility. SAI’s five stadia in the city can provide quarantine facilities for around 900 people.

On Monday evening, the office of the district magistrate (DM) of South East Delhi issued an order to the secretary SAI, directing him to immediately hand over the possession of the stadium to the district administration of the South East. The order – a copy of which is with TOI – signed by DM Harleen Kaur, who is also the chairperson of the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA, South East), stated: “It has been considered necessary to requisite premises of JLN stadium complex under the provisions of section 34 of DM Act, 2005 for utilising the same for the purpose of creating quarantine facility to house the persons/people.”

The order empowered the SDM (Defence Colony) to take possession of the JLN premises by Tuesday morning.

According to sources, the Delhi government took this urgent step after the city reported a spike in the number of confirmed cases, with Sunday alone witnessing the highest single day increase in the number at 23. As per the latest data available with government agencies, Delhi has 53 confirmed Covid-19 patients with two deaths.

Sources believe the move was necessitated to house thousands of migrant labourers and get them quarantined at a single place after they thronged the capital streets and assembled in large numbers at the Anand Vihar bus terminus over the last few days to reach their home towns in distant parts of India, especially Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

The Delhi government, as directed by the ministry of home affairs, could possibly use the JLN stadium for sheltering these thousands of workers.

The JLN stadium has 150 beds at its hostel facility located indoors. There are also some beds at its non-operational athletics academy. However, the authorities will face a before they take over the possession of the facility – to get the offices of National Anti-Doping Agency (Nada), MHA (ministry of home affairs) and Income Tax department vacated.

The trial report was sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune.DMCH principal Dr Harsh Narayan Jha said the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has certified the institute to carry out the Covid-19 tests. “NIV had recently sent trial kits to the hospital. We have sent the report to Pune laboratory for confirmation,” he said.“The testing facility for Covid-19 samples would begin at our designated laboratory from Tuesday. Now, the sample test results would be known in six to eight hours and treatment of the patients would be started accordingly,” Dr Jha said.The hospital has an isolation ward of 200 beds. There is a plan to increase the number of beds to 400 in the next couple of days. Around 35 suspected cases were getting symptomatic treatment at the hospital while 40 more suspected cases with travel history were reported there on Monday.Dr Jha said they got extraction kits, screening and confirmation kits among other items from the ICMR on Saturday. “We have written to the ICMR about the need of more propyl alcohol, personal protective equipment (PPE) kits and packaging materials,” he said and added that only 25 PPE kits were received so far.“The experts and doctors need protective suits while testing samples and performing duty in the isolation ward. From Tuesday, we will need more PPE kits even for lab technicians who will work for eight hours,” Dr Jha said.DMCH superintendent Dr Raj Ranjan Prasad said all required biomedical materials and extraction kits have been provided to the hospital administration for Covid tests.Meanwhile, Union minister of state for health and family welfare, Ashwini Kumar Choubey, has said the Covid-19 testing facility would begin at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna as well. “Instructions have been given to the AIIMS-P to set up a testing lab,” he said.Choubey said the state government is making arrangements even in the districts where there is no collection centre for Covid- 19 samples. “All officials working to check the spread of Covid-19 have been directed to strengthen the arrangements,” he said.AIIMS-P director Dr PK Singh said on Monday that all the necessary items had already been purchased, except the extraction kit. “We would start within a week the testing facility in the new virology laboratory, which was set up in September last year,” he said.",patna,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74906006,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-376761,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/corona-samples-to-be-tested-at-dmch-lab-from-today/articleshow/74899956.cms
52,['31/03/2020'],Virus reprieve: HC stays sale of Biyani’s pledged shares,"MUMBAI: In the first judicial order granting relief to a borrower hit by the coronavirus lockdown, the Bombay high court on Monday restrained IDBI Trusteeship and UBS Bank from selling shares of Kishore Biyani ’s Future Retail . The shares were pledged by Future Corporate Resources (FCRPL) to secure the debentures issued by a group company Rural Fairprice.A fall in the market value of Future Retail shares led to the pledge being invoked as the value had dropped to below what was required to provide security for the loan. The Future Group company has an outstanding loan of Rs 610 crore payable to UBS Bank. While the RBI had allowed borrowers to pause repayments for three months, loans against shares contain a clause allowing the lender to sell the pledged stock even if repayment is not due.The HC also directed UBS to withdraw any orders placed with brokers for sale of the pledged shares. Justice K K Tated said, “It is to be noted that when the debenture trust deed was executed, market value of the shares was Rs 350 per share and, because of Covid-19, the share market has collapsed and per share comes below Rs 100.” This is the first such order during the coronavirus lockdown, where the court took a view of commercial problems in an unprecedented market situation.In 2018 and 2019, Rural Fairprice Wholesale (RFWL) had borrowed Rs 670 crore from UBS London branch by pledging shares of Future Retail, which were held by FCRPL, a group company. Both RFWL and FCRPL had approached the HC for urgent orders against March 17-18 notices for the sale of the pledged shares following the market crash in the wake of the Covid-19 shutdown.Counsels Vikram Nankani, Vineet Naik, Somasekhar Sundaresan with Naik Naik Co for the Future Group company argued that Future Retail’s shares fell because of the Covid-19 outbreak and sought a stay from the sale until the markets settled down. Counsel Anirudh Hariani, Varghese Thomas and J Sagar Associates for UBS opposed any relief as the market value of the shares had fallen to Rs 350 crore compared to Rs 610 crore. “Considering the present situation of market and Covid-19, I am of the opinion that plaintiffs are required ad-interim protection till next date,” said the court. The next date falls on May 4.“This is a pragmatic development where the court has kept in mind genuine commercial problems which have affected all businesses and industries in the unprecedented corona crisis, even in cases where force majeure (an act of God) may not be an agreed term,” Future Group solicitor Ameet Naik said later.Nankani and Naik emphasised that the conduct of Future Group should be considered, as till date there was not a single payment default by them with respect to the debentures. Hariani, appearing for UBS, argued that the default on part of the Future Group company cannot be attributable to any force majeure event and that it was entitled to invoke the pledge and sell the shares in terms of the debenture trust deed.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74907348,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-734274,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/virus-reprieve-hc-stays-sale-of-biyanis-pledged-shares/articleshow/74902758.cms

NEW DELHI: India has witnessed a slower rate of progression in Covid-19 cases as compared to several other countries, even developed nations, indicating that the national lockdown and other measures are having a positive effect even though there is no scope for any laxity in enforcing social distancing, the government said on Monday.“Our analysis shows that it took 12 days for cases to rise from 100 to 1,000 in our country, whereas several developed nations, having lesser population than us, have seen a multiple times increase,” health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said. He added that in some developed nations with far less population, cases surged to 3,500; 5,000; 6,000 and even as high as 8,000 in a comparable time frame.Agarwal, however, underlined that there was no room for complacency and the level of alertness had to be high with full compliance of government guidelines and protocols related to lockdown, social distancing and quarantine. “It is an everyday battle as we are dealing with management of an infectious disease. Globally, we have seen that even if one person fails to comply, we will be back to stage zero. One person not complying with norms will infect hundred others and, in turn, those hundred will infect thousand others. Therefore, 100% alertness is required, ” Agarwal said.The government's strategy in managing the Covid-19 situation with timely interventions such as restrictions on travel from affected countries and concerted efforts by the Centre and states as well as imposition of lockdown has found some support from think tanks like Brookings India.“The escalation of cases has been very rapid in various other parts of the world, especially in countries of European Union, UK and the US. In India, though the cases are rising, the rate of growth is declining. It seems initial proactive measures such as travel ban and closure of schools and colleges around March 12 have bought us some time,” said Shamika Ravi , research director, Brookings India. According to Ravi’s assessment, the growth rate of confirmed cases since March 23 had declined to a doubling of cases every five days, as compared to doubling in every three days earlier.The health ministry reported 1,251 confirmed cases of Covid-19 till Monday. Of this, 1117 were active cases, 101 were cured and one migrant case. Total deaths stood at 29. Agarwal attributed the slower pace of rise in cases in India to people's participation in strictly following social distancing guidelines and the collective preemptive actions taken by the Centre in tandem with state governments.Ravi said the impact of the lockdown would be evident in another week but highlighted that the issue of migrant workers will have to be handled very effectively and efficiently by both the Centre and state governments. “Even if a handful of these migrants are infected, they will have a massive impact and the cases can go up significantly,” she said.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74903140,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-463895,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-lockdown-working-but-need-to-be-on-our-toes/articleshow/74903122.cms
54,['31/03/2020'],Need of the hour: More high quality PPE kits,"Acute shortage and average quality of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits is increasing worries of officials and health workers battling coronavirus at MGM Medical College and other health facilities of district.

Senior officials are unwilling to reveal exact stock of PPE available with them. “I can’t reveal the exact number (of PPE kits in stock) because it will create panic among medicos,” MGM dean Dr Jyoti Bindal said. Asked if there are just 1,000 PPE kits in stock, she said, “These number of kits remains in stock.”

According to sources, the hospital had ordered 2000 pieces of PPE kits from a supplier. The trucks carrying the supplies however got stuck due to lockdown. The delivery was scheduled on March 23, but now may arrive by Tuesday or Wednesday, sources said.

The low quality of PPE kits supplied by government initially, too are posing a problem. There are three types of kits in use at medical college.

“The highest quality kit prevents any kind of exposure and is provided to medicos in high risk zones like isolation wards in MRTB and Indore chest centre. Second is of mid-level quality provided to those working in OPDs and isolation facilities at MTH and other places but not in direct contact with positive cases. The poorest quality is supplied by state government. It is provided to those working at MYH casualty, cleaning staff at facilities not dealing with Covid-19,” said Bindal.

The scene is dismal at district health department too. At present, the department has just 200 PPE kits left in stock. “The demand is of 6,000 PPE kits,” said Dr Madhav Hasani, in-charge of stocks.

“We have placed order for 1.5 lakh PPE kits with higher authorities in Bhopal. Around 5,000 kits may be delivered within a day or so,” said Hasani.

“The demand is shooting as health teams are screening, isolating primary cases. The demand for providing kits to policemen, IMC workers, district administration officials and private hospitals is also on us,” Hasani said.

In Vizag, Eluru and Guntur, a large number of bottles were recently stolen from liquor stores. Police said these thefts were not for profit but by those who wanted to drink during the lockdown.

According to cops, the miscreants who broke into these stores did not touch cash registers. Excise officials also acknowledged that the illegal sale of arrack is growing in the absence of liquor in the state.

A case-in-point is Ajit Singh Nagar in Vijayawada, where excise sleuths and local police managed to bust an illicit liquor racket and seized 1,200 litres of jaggery used to make arrack.

Speaking to TOI, enforcement director of excise department Vineet Brijlal said they have increased the enforcement drive against illegal liquor sales across the state. “We are looking at this issue externally as well as internally. Internally, we have suspended an excise inspector for illegally selling liquor in East Godavari and even booked a case against him. Apart from that, we have set up special teams to book cases against illegal liquor transportation and sales in the state,” Brijlal told TOI.

Two instances were initially reported in Vizag and Eluru. Later, excise officials caught people trying to sell liquor in Guntur district at exorbitant prices, where 120 bottles were seized. Police sources said that a quarter bottle of a McDowels whiskey which is normally priced at Rs 160 is now being sold for Rs 500.

“Since the lockdown is in place, it isn’t easy for people to get their hands on liquor,” Brijlal added.

Nagpur: Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe’s plan to make farmers sell their produce directly in the city is yet to get streamlined as many parts of Nagpur faced shortage of fresh vegetables on Monday.

The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has made arrangements for farmers to sell their produce on an open ground near Ishwar Deshmukh College of Physical Education, Sakkardara, and near Ashirwad Talkies, Manewada Road. However, many retail vegetable sellers are unaware of the arrangement as newspapers are not being distributed in the city.

Mataprasad Gupta, a vegetable vendor from Ramdaspeth, said he had no stock on Monday. “I had gone to Cotton Market but it was closed. As a result, I had no vegetables to sell. The NMC should start the market immediately,” he said.

Ganesh Meshram, a vegetable vendor from Indora, said he too did not get any new stock on Monday and had to sell the leftover from Sunday. A buyer said that the prices of most vegetables had increased by between 10% and 25%.

NMC officials said that vegetables being sold in bulk in the two places would spread by word to mouth and soon retail sellers would start flocking there.

“We will release the names of farmers and their mobile numbers, who are coming to the city for selling their produce, on Monday evening to all media houses,” said a spokesperson.

Sugar trader Prakash Fulwani said that there was no shortage of sugar in the city. “The rumours in this regard are false,” he said.

A fruit seller from Lokmat Square said that there was no shortage of fruits in the city. “The rates have also not increased,” he said.

Suresh Lalwani, a general provisions store owner from Dhantoli, said that products like milk powder, biscuits, wheat flour, cosmetics, etc were not available. “These products are not being transported to the city. The distribution system has completely collapsed,” he told TOI.

They’re going through unfathomable hardships owing to stoppage of their income derived as wages of every day’s hard labour.

These people are migrating within the state and also to neighbouring ones with family members due to complete lockdown of all activities, except essential services,” the HC said.While hearing a plea by CH Sharma and others regarding inadequate facilities at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH), where Anup Gilda is appointed as amicus curiae, the HC adjourned hearing till April 8.

Around 14 private schools and one marriage hall have been acquired where migrant workers who are struck in Kheri district would be given shelter. A similar infrastructure may be used in future if the number of Covid-19 cases rise in the district, sources said.

The medical staff would stay in hotels while the workers will be kept in schools. Some of these workers, who are yet to reach their destination, would be provided with health screening, food and other essential services by the district administration.

SDM of Dhaurahra tehsil in Kheri, Sunandu Sudhakaran, told TOI on Monday, “We have transformed schools into screening camps [also called shelter homes] for migrant workers from other districts or states. They will be kept under quarantine here. All the migrants will be provided with towels, sanitisers, soaps and other essential items. We will ensure that they are served proper food such as puri, sabji, dal and rice. We have also deputed at least two police constables at each screening centre to ensure that these people don’t leave the centre until the lockdown is over. A team of health officials will regularly monitor the health condition of these workers and provide a report to the district administration.”

Kheri CMO Manoj Agarwal said, “All these people have mainly come to Kheri from Delhi, NCR and Maharashtra. They will be staying in schools outside the village and their medical screening will be conducted at community health centres. We are preparing a list of such people with the help of district administration. The workers have been advised not to meet anyone and ensure they are regularly wearing masks and maintaining a two-metre distance from others.”

“The district administration has acquired two hotels where health officials like doctors, pharmacists and other staff looking after the treatment of those infected with Covid-19 would stay,” he added.

The authorities have identified eight decentralized spots spread across four zones as replacement for consumers to buy vegetables.

Officials said the decision to indefinitely close the market was taken to ensure social distancing and adhere with the nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19.

While the district administration has allotted space for retail sales of vegetables to the public, the locations for the transaction between wholesale and retail vegetable traders are yet to be defined.

“Wholesale vegetable traders supply vegetables to retail traders who in turn sell to the public. With the closure of the Gandhi market, we have not been allotted any particular place for the wholesale operations,” US Karupiah, a trader in Gandhi market said. Traders said that G Corner ground in Ponmalai remains as the frontrunner to serve as an alternative for the wholesale market.

Congress city secretary Rohit Yadav, a resident of Kasturba Nagar slum, was booked by the Jaripatka police for obstructing NMC workers engaged in spraying disinfectant in the area.

A police complaint was lodged by BJP corporators from the ward, Virendra Kukreja and Mahendra Dhanvijay, and NMC health department.

Senior PI of Jaripatka Khushal Tijare told TOI, “Offence has been registered against Yadav under section 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public duty, section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and section 3 of The Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act. He came to police station and we served intimation notice to him. He will have to appear in court,” he said.

Yadav told TOI, “There is panic in Kasturba Nagar having around 300 houses after positive patients of Covid-19 were detected in Jaripatka. But disinfectant was being sprayed only in Sindhi Colony, Jaripatka. I started spraying disinfectant on Monday morning with a machine provided by Congress city president Vikas Thakre on my request. I noticed that a few NMC workers were spraying only water in our area. The workers too admitted this. NMC should not cheat people,” he said.

The Congress secretary stated that he didn’t mean to obstruct any NMC work. “I emptied the tank used by the workers only to show people that it had only water. I made a mistake in not informing the police and handing over the workers,” he said.

In a video that became viral on social media, Yadav can be seen spraying some milk coloured liquid from his machine. He is also seen spraying from the NMC worker’s tank. The liquid in this tank appears like normal water in the video.

NMC deputy commissioner Dr Pradeep Dasarwar said, “NMC is spraying sodium hypochlorite across the city. Manual spraying is being done in areas where positive patients were found. Fire tenders are being used for main roads and other parts of the city,” he said.

Kukreja said, “It is unfortunate that some people are trying to play politics despite the serious situation. Mayor Sandip Joshi has ordered spraying of disinfectant after positive patients were found in Jaripatka. The NMC has initiated all measures to control Covid-19,” he said.

The NMC is also spraying disinfectant in the housing society at central Nagpur where one positive case was detected on Sunday.

Deputy collector (disaster management) Anu S Nair said around a dozen IT professionals have been working from various locations to develop the app.“They have been involved in the development of various platforms to co-ordinate activities aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19 in the district,” he said.Bharat Govind, convener of Inter-Agency Group, a taskforce of young volunteers trained under the district administration, said various IT solutions will be introduced the same way China effectively utilised technology to control the spread of the pandemic.“The app will have two versions. One version is for the people on home quarantine. The other is for ASHA workers. With the support of ASHA workers, people on home quarantine can upload the app on to their phones. The drawback of other apps is that if the people leave the phone at home, their location cannot be identified. People who use this app are asked to send pictures every 30 minutes. It will help the authorities identify their location. If there is a delay in updating pictures, ASHA workers will alert them. It will help them ensure that they stay in their homes,” he said.Moreover, the app’s features allow users to give updates on the progress of the treatment and details of the stock of essentials they have with them, among other things.“Either the person on quarantine can update the information or the ASHA worker can do it for them,” said Govind.In addition to this, a website ‘Sahayahastam’ is being readied to update information on details of provisions and other items available in shops in the district.The deputy collector said the traders agreed with the idea at a meeting recently held with them. The website will enable traders to log in and update availability of items.The district administration is also planning to introduce a telemedicine facility for people who suffer from various health issues. “It will help them to consult doctors via Skype so that the they can avoid visiting hospitals,” he said.If the IT-solutions are found to be effective in the pilot implementation in district, it will be extended to other districts too.Geofencing was introduced in Kottayam by the cyber wing under district police chief G Jaidev around 10 days ago.

Till now, 30,000 litres of disinfectants have been used for spraying in the area.A senior municipal health official said for the past two days a mass disinfection drive is being carried out in the entire area using 1% sodium hypochlorite solution. “We are using mini-tankers of the horticulture department for spraying disinfectants as the larger ones cannot enter even the main lanes. For narrower lanes, shoulder-mounted knapsack pumps are being used to sanitise the area,” the official added.“A few houses are so tightly packed that workers are finding it difficult to move around even with their shoulder-mounted pumps. Currently, we are focusing on drains, mosques, pathways, community toilets, shops and lanes. Two rounds have been finished,” another civic official said, adding that contact tracing is going to be difficult as thousands of people from across the country visit the dargah.Tablighi Jamaat, whose headquarters is at the centre of the contact tracing exercise, is an Islamic missionary movement. It focuses on urging people to return to practising the religion as it was during the lifetime of Prophet Muhammad in matters of ritual, dress and personal behaviour. Nizamuddin dargah is located a few hundred metres down the lane.While no official of Tablighi Jamaat could be reached, Syed Kashif Ali Nizami, chief in-charge of the dargah, said, “The entire shrine has been disinfected twice. Though there is some panic in the community, appeals are being made from mosques and the dargah asking people not to come out of their houses. Police are doing their work and we will play our role. I have appealed to people not to sit together and offer prayers at home.”Residents of the gated upscale Nizamuddin West colony are also a worried lot as a few positive cases have been found there. Yasmin Kidwai, the area councillor, has been receiving multiple requests of disinfection drives. “Disinfection need to be scaled up keeping in mind the congested area. Lack of clear communication is leading to panic and stress in the community,” she said.While Delhi Police has deployed drones to enforce the lockdown, former mayor Farhad Suri said they should be used to increase the pace of disinfection. “Apart from the pumping sets of the corporation, I’m procuring four units so that more resources can be stationed in the area. There is an urgent need to calm the nerves and win the confidence of people.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74903794,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-234739,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/drones-masked-men-30k-litres-of-disinfectant/articleshow/74902436.cms

VARANASI: At least 24 grocery and vegetable traders were caught selling essential commodities at prices high than fixed by the district administration, on Monday.

Nine traders were held during a reality check by district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma and SSP Prabhakar Chawdhary in Chetganj market on Monday morning. Both the officails reached the market posing as a common buyer and caught the traders involved in overpricing. The trade tax officials, who had been assigned the task to check the overpricing, have also come under the scanner.

The action led to chaos in the market as traders started pulling down their shutters. Their union leaders also tried to stage a protest following which two of such leaders were arrested.

SP city Dinesh Kumar Singh said that nine traders have been arrested on the charges of overpricing and black marketing. They were booked under appropriate section of essential commodities Act while their two leaders were booked for breaching peace under section 151 of code of criminal procedure by Chetganj police.

Following frequent complaints of overpricing and black marketing of essential commodities during Covid-19 lockdown, the DM and the SSP reached Chetganj market with carry bags as common buyers and started purchasing essential goods including food grains and vegetables. While purchasing goods they found nine traders selling essential commodities at high prices despite the fact that the revised price list of such goods had already been issued by the administration on Sunday.

The DM ordered the Chetganj police to arrest these traders and lodge FIRs against them.

The action against the traders led to chaos in Chetganj and neighbouring Paan Dariba markets. The traders started pulling down their shutters and the local trader union leaders tried to gather at Chetganj crossing to stage protest against the arrested of the traders. The policemen arrested two of their leaders and made the mob disperse.

Other four teams formed by the DM under magistrates also conducted similar surprise inspections and caught 15 traders in the markets of their areas concerned. They were also sent to jail after lodging FIRs at different police stations.

The DM said that show cause notice is being issued to trade tax officials. The DM had assigned the task of monitoring the markets to 25 trade tax officials and had made it clear that stern action would be taken against the officials if any case of overpricing is detected during the lockdown.

Meanwhile, one Bharat Mishra of Bharthara village under Lohta police station was arrested for attacking a sub-inspector Pankaj Singh aftrer he instructed Bharat to go inside his home.

VARANASI: As the administrative machinery and NGOs are engaged in arranging food and shelters for the needy people and migrant workers, several rural women associated with different self-help groups (SHGs) are making masks and PPE (personal protective equipment) kits as their contribution in the fight against Covid-19. The PPE kit is a specialized clothing worn for protection against infections.

Chief development officer (CDO) Mahusudan Nagaraj Hugli said that fabrics and other facilities for preparing masks and PPE kits are being provided to them. “It is the best way to utilize the lockdown time and earn money too,” Hugli told TOI on Monday.

According to the CDO, about 273 identified SHGs comprising of 629 women have been engaged in this work. So far, they have supplied over 14,649 masks and PPE kits. On an average, they are making 1,500 masks and PPE kits every day.

This initiative has been undertaken to overcome the scarcity of masks and PPE kits by engaging the women under National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM). “These women are not only helping the local administration in maintaining the supply of these safety tools, but they have also searched a way of livelihood in such a critical situation,” said Hugli adding that these women have set an example with their social commitment.

Besides, some other women are involved in making masks with their own resources. “With our own available resources we are making masks to distribute among people free of cast,” said Rituja Kushwaha , the team leader of Jagriti SHG at Sajaoi village, supported by an NGO Human Welfare Association (HWA). Many group members including Geeta, Suman Vibha and others could be seen busy in making masks.

They plan to cover nearly 9,000 houses and 45,000 people. This is the second circle of houses around the house of 25-year-old Spain returnee who tested positive last week.

On Saturday, the public health department instructed districts to take up a containment plan involving marking a 5km radius around every positive patient’s house and the places they frequented.

In Coimbatore, the one positive patient was in Saibaba Colony and she visited K Pudur, according to the information the patient provided to the health department.

“We drew a 5km radius and a further 2km buffer zone around that radius. We finished the first 1km to 1.5km circle around the patient’s house on Sunday,” said a doctor at the KK Pudur primary health centre.

The first circle included around 900 houses and 4,980 people.

“We took a little longer with every house on Sunday, because they were closer in proximity to the patient’s house. So, we interacted more with families,” said one of the nurses.

The nurses said on Sunday and by 12pm on Monday, they did not come across any patient with fever or breathlessness.

“We did have some mild cold and cough cases, but they had no suspicious contacts or travel history, we advised them to room quarantine themselves. We advised people above 60 and those with heart problem and uncontrolled diabetes, to be extra careful and report even a sore throat lasting more than two days. We gave them phone numbers to call, so we can go check them instead of them coming to our clinic,” another nurse said.

“On Tuesday, we will check the final 1-1.5 km in the outer circle of the patient’s house which includes areas around MM Nursing Home, Nesavalar Colony, GCT college area, Kavundampalayam and Sivanandha Colony,” the doctor said.

The health workers must keep a tab on 57-odd foreign returnees in their circle and check for quarantine violators.

Nurses however say their door to door visits have so far been a smooth process.

“Our area is mostly populated with educated people. The families with foreign returnees are cooperative. Only a few people in slums give us irresponsible answers,” the doctor said.

Many people, especially senior citizens, in Saibaba Colony have begun panicking since they learned that a Covid-19 positive patient was from their area.

“I have moved my mother in her late seventies out of my house to KTVR gardens a little away,” a chartered accountant said.

Sreelatha, 31, who recently gave birth to a baby boy moved out of her mother’s house on Alagesan Road at Saibaba Colony to her husband’s place in Tirupur last week.

“I moved to Tirupur, when I heard the girl is from Saibaba Colony and she went out a few times after returning from Spain,” she said.

He shared the joy by treating hundreds of slum dwellers living Atladara checkpost with food by starting a community kitchen near-by.

Galsar has been keeping watch over vehicles coming from and going to Padra at Atladara check post since janata curfew on March 24. On March 28, Galsar’s family members in Banaskantha broke into celebrations as the cop was blessed with a baby girl .

“My friends and I were planning to start a community kitchen for these people many were sleeping hungry. On March 28 when we had just dispatched the first batch of food, I received the news that I have been blessed with a baby girl and all family members were celebrating,” Galsar said.

As holidays of all cops have been cancelled, Galsar regrets that he could not be beside his wife.

“I cannot join the celebrations, so I decided to serve the food to slum dwellers and celebrate in my own way,” he said.

“We have got an opportunity to serve people in times of distress but when people get meals two times in a day it is nothing less than celebration,” said Galsar, who is a cop in Vadodara for 11 years.

Galsar said he plans to take a long holiday to spend time with my daughter, his second child, once the situation normalizes.

Besides serving food in slum dwellers, Galsar and his friends also hand over packets to those are walking back to their hometown on Padra road. The team had started with small meals like ‘khichdi’, but now with donations pouring in they are also making different dishes.

“Eating khichdi daily can be too monotonous so we have started to cook different dishes,” Galsar said. A cook has been offering his services on voluntary basis but during his off-duty hours Galsar too helps with chopping vegetables.“We will continue this community kitchen as long as the lockdown remains so that nobody sleeps hungry,” he told TOI.

Inspector BG Chetariya of Manjalpur police station told TOI: ""It’s a proud moment for me as a person working under me is working like this without getting concerned about the risks he is exposed to. Despite such a happy occasion at his home, he is working for the people and I hope it continues to do great work.”

TOI reported on Monday that amaranthus farmers in Vellayani and Punchakkari were forced to cut spinach and dump it as they were finding it hard to sell their produce due to the lockdown.

Owing to the number of food packets being delivered daily and hurdles in smooth supply of goods from across the state border, the corporation is also stretching its resources to get the community kitchens running. The authorities said that if farm produce from local farmers could be sourced, it could help them maintain a decent menu for community kitchens also farmers will also get value for their efforts.

The court directed the government to ensure that no patient gets turned away without getting medical care.

He was later traced with the help of CCTV footage video and arrested by the police.Dr Vishwas Chaudhary, Meerut district surveillance officer, said, “On Monday, 382 teams had gone for a door-to-door survey to check if anyone has a foreign travel history or is having Covid-19 like symptoms. However, when our teams went to Karim Nagar, some locals misbehaved with them.”“I was conducting the survey in Karimnagar Lane number four, when a man came and started questioning me whether I had permission to do the survey. When I told him that I have the supporting documents to conduct active case findings, he held my hands from behind and told me that he would take me to the counsellor of the area.

KOLKATA: While the state struggles to fight the novel coronavirus, people from the Northeast living in Kolkata are battling racism. Several reports of linking people from the Northeast to the virus are pouring in. While most ignored the racist comments, some nurses attached with a hospital said they will lodge a police complaint.

A 24-year-old airline cabin crew member from Sikkim, who has been living in Kolkata for the past four years, was allegedly taunted by healthcare workers of a Tollygunge government hospital where she had to stay for a night on being suspected to have contracted Covid-19 two days ago. “First, the healthcare providers at the fever clinic of the hospital asked if I was Chinese. I was in pain and wasn’t in a condition to retort. Even as I explained I was suffering from UTI, they bundled me into the isolation ward,” said the woman.

“As I entered the so-called isolation ward, which is a dormitory, a woman patient screamed and asked the hospital staffers why a Chinese carrying the novel coronavirus was being admitted to the ward. I was shocked and very hurt,” the woman said. “I was in too much pain to protest. Luckily, the next afternoon they discharged me, advising home quarantine. This was a bitter experience in the city, which is my second home,” she said.

In another incident, a young nurse from Manipur attached with a private hospital was allegedly spat upon by a motorcyclist when she, along with her friend, stepped out of her paying guesthouse in Mukundapur on Sunday night. The duo was going to the hospital in the same area. “Two youths on motorcycle zipped passed them. One of them spat paan on the nurse, while the other shouted that these ‘coronaviruses’ were spreading Covid-19 in the city,” alleged a fellow nurse.

The two are planning to lodge a police complaint.

HARIDWAR: A travel agency owner was arrested late on Sunday night for transporting migrant workers of Bareilly district ( Uttar Pradesh ) from Haridwar using a fake permission letter. The arrest was made after two buses going towards Haridwar-Bijnor highway were stopped by Haridwar DM C Ravishankar and city SSP Senthil Avoodai Krishna Raj S at Chandi Bridge during patrolling.

SSP Senthil Avoodai told TOI, “Two buses of a travel agency were stopped for inspection and it was found out that they were carrying migrant workers using fake permission letters prepared by the company. A case has been registered against Tehri resident Ajay Chaudhary, the owner of the company, under sections 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of other), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged 1[document or electronic record]) and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code . On Monday, Ajay Chaudhary was arrested by our team.”

Meanwhile, Haridwar police also siezed a vehicle ferrying 55 tourists who were on their way to West Bengal.

The vehicle owner had permission for transporting essential commodities but was instead found transporting people. A case has been registered against the accused driver under section 188 of the IPC and further investigation is underway.Notably, several migrant workers from neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, who work in the unorganised sector or in factories at SIDCUL, have become stranded in Haridwar because of the Covid-19 lockdown. As these workers desperately want to return to their homes, some tour operators and travel agents are milking the crisis by trying to ferry them using illegal means in return for money.

It must be also mentioned here that the migrant workers who had marched all the way to UP border were not allowed entry into their home state by UP Police officials in view of the coronavirus pandemic.

These facilities set up in government schools will be a kind of quarantine facility for few thousand workers from outside the state and the districts. As on Monday evening, over 1,500 workers have been accomodated. Food and water will also be provided to them.

TOI on Monday visited the Adarsh Senior Secondary School in Adarsh Nagar where nearly 100 workers mainly from Uttar Pradesh and Delhi have been housed.

Soon after they were brought by police from various parts of the city, they underwent a medical test. Then they were shifted to different classrooms. There were four women in the group who have been provided a separate room.

Four school employees including principal Sandhya Arya and officials from the collectorate — tehsildar Arun Sharma and Patwari Ravi Pratap Singh — were present in the institute to oversee the arrangements. “We have arranged for food and water for the labourers. A team of medical staff has checked on them and none of them is suffering from ailments,” Arya said.

“We will keep them here for at least two weeks and wait for further directions by the government. Most of these people are from Uttar Pradesh,” tehsildar Arun Sharma said.

“I used to work in a book publishing house at Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh . I was on way to my hometown in Hathras. We started from Ratlam yesterday morning (Sunday) and reached Jaipur from Kota this morning (Monday). We were stopped by police and brought here this morning,” said Ashok Kushwaha, who walked half the way apart from riding on trucks, buses and auto-rickshaws to reach Jaipur.

Asked about what his future plans are, Ashok thought for a while and said, “Let’s see what happens. First, I want to go home. My mother, father, wife and children stay there. So, I started from Ratlam hoping to get back home at the earliest. The contractor gave Rs 1,000 to each one of us for travel expenses and food,” he added.

Similar was the plight of a vegetable vendor Pradeep Kumar from Dahod in Gujarat. “I started my journey on Friday. I covered the journey till Jaipur partly on foot and partly in trucks. Now I am stuck. I know I have to stay here for at least 14 days,” he said. Kumar was on his way to his hometown in Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh.

Kochi: Life was more or less normal in Mattancherry and Chullickal from where the first Covid-19 death in the state was reported on Saturday. However, people have become more vigilant as most of them were seen staying indoors on Sunday.

Meanwhile, health workers and councillors have been taking measures to build confidence among the public, especially those living in the apartment complex where the deceased was residing. “We are providing, those in quarantine, with medicines and other essential commodities,” said Jayanthi Premnath, councillor representing Chullickal division. “There are 42 people in quarantine in the apartment complex where the deceased had been living. We were in constant touch with some of the people residing in the apartment complex updating them regarding the condition of the patient. We had asked them to give others mental support in case the person under treatment dies. So, they managed the situation well,” she added.

At the same time, people have become more dependent as they have been calling up health workers, councillors and other volunteers for fixing even petty issues. There are incidents of homemakers, who are in home quarantine, seeking support for replacing empty gas cylinders with new ones. “A homemaker had sought support from us in this regard. She and her mentally-retarded son are living in a house. Earlier, the delivery boys with gas agencies or some of the neighbours would help them. Now, nobody is ready to help them,” said Antony Francis, councillor.

Premnath too faced a similar experience. “Given the situation, we are unable to send anybody to their houses. We have sought the help from health department. For the time being, we have been giving cooked meals to the family,” she said.

Meanwhile, people’s representatives, who attended a meeting convened by agriculture minister V S Sunil Kumar at Kochi Corporation office on Sunday, raised questions regarding tracking of contacts of housemaid who worked in the apartment complex where the deceased had been living. “The woman would certainly have used the lift and then would have gone to the bus stop and boarded a bus. Then, she would have gone to market before reaching her house at another apartment complex. We asked the district authorities whether her route mapping was done. They just nodded and didn’t explain,” one of the councillors who raised the issue said.

According to health department officials, the death of a person with severe comorbidities underline the need for protecting those belonging to high-risk group. “Youngsters and healthy persons should protect the elderly and those with comorbidities. Proper sanitization as part of break the chain project should be done. This will help reduce the risk,” said Dr Mathew Numbelil, district manager National Health Mission, and one of the persons leading Covid-19 care activities in the district.

Plucking around 200 to 500g of vegetables every day, terrace gardening enthusiasts are comparatively having a relaxed lockdown.

Harihara Karthiyen, Thiruverumbur-based terrace gardening expert, has not stepped out of his house in past week to buy vegetables. “A dozen varieties of vegetables are cultivated at our house using the vacant space where sunlight is available. Harvesting 200-500g of various vegetables is enough for us for a day,” Karthikeyan said. People here grow gardens in 350 to 1,000sqft area on their terraces in green bags sheltered with a protective mesh. A few houses even have drip irrigation system. The gardeners claimed that they have stocked vegetables such as onions and potatoes ahead of the lockdown since such vegetables are difficult to grow on the terrace. “While others fear about the quality of vegetable and the way they were transported amidst the Covid-19 scare, we have no doubts in the quality of vegetables grown on our terraces using natural fertilisers,” says Vency John from Crawford. Tomato, spinach, curry leaves, mint, radish, green chilli, brinjal and beans were harvested on the terraces.

If vegetables were harvested in rotation, people can meet the vegetable requirements for a week without stepping outside, said the terrace farmers. Besides the residents, Trichy Corporation’s establishments such as all-weather shelter for the homeless on Bharathiyar Road are also practising terrace farming. Terrace gardening exhibitions conducted by the corporation in the past two years have encouraged around 10,000 residents to pursue terrace farming in the city. Terrace gardening enthusiasts opined that the ongoing lockdown has highlighted to residents the importance of growing vegetables to manage the daily needs.

102,['31/03/2020'],Red Cross launches blood donation challenge,"Bhubaneswar: After several blood banks in the state went dry owing to the ongoing lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus, the Indian Red Cross Society here has come up with a unique initiative to tide over the shortage through a blood donation challenge.

“Through this initiative, the Red Cross members are encouraging individual volunteers to visit their nearest blood bank and donate blood as congregations are restricted at the moment. Many people, especially thalassemia and critical patients, are in need of blood,” Junior Red Cross officer Laxman Swain said.

He added that mass blood collection drives used to be undertaken in colleges and other educational institutions. But owing to the shutdown, such camps were not being conducted, resulting in a shortage of blood.

“There is a need to bridge the gap between the donors and the receivers. We can’t organise big blood donation drives owing to the social distancing protocol. But we can go in person and donate blood in the blood banks at least. It will not expose one to the virus as some people are fearing,” he explained.

Several blood banks in the city in particular and the state, at large, reported shortage of blood of all compositions soon after the lockdown was imposed. Not only public facilities, but private hospitals too reported acute shortage of blood.

According to the data on availability of blood on Monday, the Capital Hospital has the highest of about 47 units of blood of different groups while BMC Hospital in Old Town area has 14 units of blood. The district headquarters hospital in Khurda has 27 units of blood. The private blood banks also have more or less the same number of blood units.

“We are conducting in-house collection drives to meet the requirement of blood. Patients need regular infusion of blood. We are trying to help them,” Capital Hospital director Ashok Kumar Pattnaik said.

Usually, fee collection in these schools go on till mid of April every year beginning from the last week of March. Unlike state board and matriculation schools, for CBSE schools, the academic year begins in April. While Class X and XII are exceptions, other classes conclude their annual examination by mid of March.

“By this time, we would have collected fee and books would have been distributed to students,” said Padma Srinivasan president, of Rockcity Sahodaya School complex. This is an academic forum of CBSE schools around Trichy to discuss academic progress.

Given the extraordinary situation, we have decided not to initiate fee collection for time being, she said.

Respective CBSE schools procure books for their children and the money is collected along with the fees. Most schools have procured NCERT books through CBSE allotted vendors. But, it is also natural on part of the schools to postpone the process until further orders on reopening of the schools come, she said.

On Sunday, a section of parents in the city had raised a complaint against the schools after receiving emails seeking payment of the fee. While the communication also mentioned collection of fine for late payment, parents raised alarm.

Speaking to TOI on the issue, Trichy district chief education officer S Santhi said the communication was old, and the school did not make any fresh attempt to collect the fee. However, schools could not prevent automatically generating emails on fee collection as staffs could not reach school all these days during the lockdown, she said.

From onset of summer to felling of trees to pollution and the eeriness due to lockdown, they are speculating different causes behind it.Stressing that the vanishing trend of urban bats is a sign that needs to be looked into, the experts also feel that this mammal does not succumb to viruses and here lies the chance to find vaccines or medicines to fight the corona pandemic.It all started when Deepak Apte, a well-known conservationist and director of the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), posted on social media about a large colony of around 10,000 bats outside his Thane house having disappeared in the last 15 days. It was the first time in last four years that the roost was not seen.Soon after his post, many people started sharing similar observations from different parts of the country. “After my post, I got similar reports from many parts in Mumbai (Mahim, Prabhadevi), Gujarat (Surat), Karnataka (Mysuru), Rajasthan etc,” says Apte.Reacting to his post, Avinash Hemdev wrote: “Thousands of bats at a location in Chennai have drastically reduced. Something’s up!” Mumbai-based Niranjan Demanna shared similar trend: “We have a fig tree next to our building and every year, we used to see 50-60 bat. This year, we didn’t see a single bat.”While residents of RBI Colony in Prabhadevi in Mumbai reported about a colony of bats vanishing around two weeks back, Kanchan Ankolekar highlighted how the mammals are no longer seen at the trees opposite Kachrali lake in Thane. “I received similar observation from Mysore by Dr Dipak Vyas,” says Apte.The observations have led to various conjectures to unlock the mystery of disappearing bats. According to some, it is quite common for the species to change roosts. “But as a naturalist, for me the question is why is it happening from so many locations at the same time. Is it due to the onset of summer or is it because silence due to lockdown having some effect on these mammals? They are urban bats and generationally used to very high noise, illumination and other disturbances,” says Apte.According to well-known environmentalist D Stalin, who is also the director of NGO Vanashakti, a complete migration of a huge colony like the one reported by Apte is unusual. “I would attribute it to the onset of summer. Generally bats don’t venture out in winters and the activity is less. Having said that, factors like pollution are also responsible,” he says.Highlighting the role played by anthropogenic activities, Stalin adds, “Another reason could be if large trees, abandoned buildings or caves which are home to the bats are disturbed due to excessive human ingress, It can also cause migration of the specie.”Can the trend be related to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic? “It is too early to connect the lockdown with the recent incidents of migration of bats. Only a detailed data analysis will reveal the reasons,” feels Stalin.Experts, however, feel that being carriers of viruses like corona, bats can prove to useful in combating the disease. “Bats do not succumb to the viruses but manage to stay uninfected. This means their immune systems have the ability to fight viruses and in this lies the chance for humans to find the vaccines or medicines needed to fight virus pandemics,” says Stalin.In reply to Apte’s post, Dattaprasad Sawant had shared similar views. “Many other coronaviruses similar to Covid-19 are residing in bats. It seems bats are not affected by Covid 19,” he wrote.Even though bats are known to change their habitats, conservationists feel an in-depth scientific research is needed on the current disappearance. “Any mass migration of fauna is always an indicator of changes in the nearby environment. If there are no known recent modifications in the nearby environment, the disappearance of ecological indicators like bats need attention. So we should wait till the data is received from various parts of the country,” says Stalin.Stressing that having knowledge of roosting sites is important for conserving bats, Apte says, “They roost on large shady trees and in urban areas, felling of trees can also have a negative impact on these animals. They play absolutely valuable role in ecosystem. With rapidly changing climate, these animals are also exposed to climate vagaries.”",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sudden-disappearance-of-bats-from-urban-areas-of-country-intrigues-experts/articleshow/74902991.cms
105,['31/03/2020'],Thousands of workers stuck in state have assembled at dist headquarters posing a big challenge for admin,"Nainital/Dehradun: Thousands of migrant labourers are stuck in the interior areas of the state following the nationwide lockdown. Estimates suggest that there are scores of workers hailing from states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand as well as Nepal working in construction and mining projects across Uttarakhand on daily wages who are left with no money and help. On Monday, hundreds of such workers gathered at the district headquarters in Bageshwar hoping that the administration will arrange means for them to travel to their homes.

Other districts and block level offices across Kumaon and Garhwal have also reported that thousands of workers are stuck in remote areas of the state and are awaiting the government’s help to get food or to be evacuated. Shakeel Ahmed, a 50-year-old labourer who had come to Bageshwar said that he has been on the road for four days when he was told that the state government is allowing travel on March 31 and he can go to his home in Bareilly. “I work as a daily wager. I left my home in Kapkot four days ago and came here. However, when I went to the district headquarters, we were informed that the ordwer has been withdrawn,” he said.

Ahmed added that the administration didn’t even give them food or any other essential supplies when they asked for it. Some volunteers and activists from Red Cross society finally helped him. “We were turned away saying that we have no documents and therefore they cannot give us food. Finally some local residents helped us and made us stay in a local shelter,” he said.

Speaking to TOI, some locals and activists said that there are hundreds of people like Ahmed who have come to Bageshwar from places such as Kapkot, Garud and Kanda blocks and are in need of food and essential supplies.

“There are thousands of mining and construction daily wagers who are stuck in the interior areas of the state and are now coming to tehsils and district headquarters. These people are in dire need of help. Though the local residents have helped some of them, the administration also needs to get on its toes to provide relief,” said Pramod Mehta, a local activist.

People from Champawat and Tanakpur towns also reported that hundreds of migrants have started their long march from the interior areas to these towns so that they can get help to reach home. “People working on the National Highway project in Pithoragarh have also reached Tanakpur and Champawat town in the hope that they will now be able to travel to their homes. Many of them had the hopes that as the buses will start to run on Tuesday they will go home but that won't be possible now so they are on the mercy of the administration now,” said Amit Kumar a local of Tanakpur.

Kumaon commissioner Rajeev Rautela’s office said that local administrations have been directed to arrange essential items for the migrants and help will be provided without asking for any documents.

Meanwhile, an Uttarakhand Transport Corporation bus ferrying 50 state residents, living in Gujarat, was stopped at Haryana border on Monday. The bus had gone to Gujarat to pick up these people and was coming back to Uttarakhand. A communique from the CM’s office said that a Haryana police team denied permission to passengers to go ahead and added that the driver had to return to Uttarakhand without passengers.

107,['31/03/2020'],Tamil Nadu: Covid-19 patient beats loneliness with TikTok,"Picture used for representational purpose only

TRICHY: A 25-year-old Covid-19 positive woman under treatment in the isolation ward of the Ariyalur government hospital has kicked up a storm on social media by recording and sharing videos on the TikTok platform. Attempts by the hospital management to take away the mobile phone went in vain as the patient held on to it firmly, telling the authorities that recording videos was her only means to overcome loneliness.

Ever since the woman, a native of Ariyalur who worked in a mall in Chennai, tested positive for Covid-19 on March 27, 2020, she has shared at least six videos from the isolation ward. On Monday evening, the woman was seen making videos with and without the facemask and an oxygen mask. The lip-sync videos in Tamil include funny takes on the Covid-19 outbreak. Some of the thousands of social media users who viewed it insisted that she ‘take rest’.

On coming to know about the videos going online, the hospital management advised the patient against recording and sharing them. But she argued that she was engaging in such activities to overcome the loneliness she was experiencing for the past five days. “At the moment, we are concerned about her recovery from Covid-19,” a senior medical professional from the Ariyalur GH said.

Health department officials said they have no instructions to seize mobile phones of patients in the isolation ward. They said counselling will be provided to the patient by a psychologist to ensure her mental health.

Trichy-based clinical psychologist Randeep Rajkumar said such behaviour is common in extroverts subjected to sudden isolation. “The mobile phone should remain with the patient as it will reduce her anxiety level. Snatching away the phone will only stress her further,” he said. Rajkumar also suggested relaying comedies or engaging videos in the isolation wards to prevent patients from feeling lonely. A few days ago, three sanitary workers in the Ariyalur GH were quarantined in the isolation ward for having close contact with the Covid-19 positive woman. One of the three workers reportedly took part in a TikTok video with the woman.

The mission is currently looking for ideas and products that support Covid-19 patients and those placed on quarantine. It is also looking at ideas to prevent community outbreak, logistics for distributing food, medicine and grocery, support vulnerable people like children and aged.

“If these products are good enough, the state government would adopt them. KSUM will support the startups to implement or manufacture them if the PoC is sound,” said a KSUM official.

KSUM is also looking at ideas that can create job opportunities during lockdown and manufacture of Do It Yourself (DIY) products like masks, gloves and sanitizers.

Students, innovators, individuals, communities and NGOs can also register at the platform to participate in the initiative.

Individual applicants or teams that submits ideas and solutions are expected to have good domain knowledge. The ideas submitted will be evaluated by a panel of experts in the respective domains.

THANJAVUR: Help came clad in khaki for the daily wage earners under the Panthanallur police station limits in Thanjavur who are struggling to make ends meet due to the lockdown to fight Covid-19.

Under the station’s jurisdiction are hamlets Panthanallur, Keela Katur, Mela Kattur, Karuppur and Vellore, whose inhabitants are mostly daily wage earners, engaged in construction, agriculture and conservancy work. The natiowide lockdown has left them without work, and hence no money to put some food on the plate.

To help them, inspector K Suguna of the Panthanallur police station, has been giving out essentials for free, spending money out of her own pocket.

“My team and I have been going to each hamlet to sensitise people on Covid-19 and why it is necessary for them to stay indoors to avoid spread of coronavirus. On one such visit on March 25, I saw some villagers struggle to put together a meal since they had no income,” said Suguna, adding that if the villagers didn’t get any work, they went hungry.

“I wanted to help them out somehow. So, I volunteered to distribute essentials like rice, dal and soap to those struggling,” she added. She now distributes groceries that can help them tide over a few days at least.

“Our higher officers had instructed us to help people in all possible ways, to make them stay at home. As of now, I am doing this using my own money. My colleagues have assured to help too,” she said.

Inspector Suguna’s good deed has earned appreciation from her seniors and villagers alike.

One of the stranded men, Man Bahadur, said, “I walked 45 km with my wife and two children from Didihat, reaching Dharchula on March 29, in the hope the suspension bridge across the border here would be open. But the Nepal government did not open the gates on Monday, so we are forced to stay here.”

Another Nepalese citizen, Deepak Kumar, said he had walked from Pangla, 35 km away.Although Nepal had closed the border with India between March 23 and 29, it allowed 215 and 160 workers respectively on both dates to cross the suspension bridges at the borders in Dharchula and Jhulaghat on March 27, said Pithoragarh DM Vijay Kumar Jogdande. But on Monday, the Nepal government extended its lockdown till April 7, and did not open the borders, he added, even as more Nepalese arrived, hoping to cross over.The DM said that the district administration will make arrangements for shelter and food for those stranded.

Meanwhile, civil society groups like Rung Museum, Garbyal Mahila Sangh and Pahari Jayaka are also arranging rations for the stranded Nepalese, said Salu Datal, a local resident.

Meanwhile, sources said that four of the stranded labourers decided to swim across the Kali river, which forms the natural border between the two countries , to reach Nepal. Three of them managed to cross over, where they were immediately arrested by Nepal Police. The fourth person turned back from mid-river.

PUNE: Since its launch on March 24, the ‘Dial an Autorickshaw’ initiative has served more than 1,200 people.

With the average number of daily calls going past the 1,500-mark, the authorities have decided to enable WhatsApp on the same number (9859198591) so that more requests can be fielded.

The service was launched to address the emergency travel needs of people. In the week since it started, CityGlide Auto, which provides the service in coordination with the Pune traffic police, has received more than 11,000 phone calls — a daily average of nearly 1,600.

“We are operating 180 autorickshaws, but the number of calls has gone up exponentially, and we are not able to receive many of those calls. With our Twitter handles now receiving requests, people can now also send a message on WhatsApp on the same number to place a request ,” Rahul Shitole, CityGlide CEO, said.

He said only those in need of essential travel, as mentioned in the government’s notification regarding the lockdown, must place a request.

“By Tuesday or Wednesday, a fleet of 100 more autorickshaws will be pressed into service, meaning more customers can be served. All autorickshaw drivers have been provided approval certificates by traffic police,” Shitole said, adding that there was also an advance booking option.

“Close to 70% calls from people are related to medical issues. People have appointments for dialysis or chemotherapy session, and need autorickshaws. Such people can now either WhatsApp or tweet us their details, the emergency, the date of the appointment, etc, preferably a day or two in advance. This apart, we also get requests from people wanting to buy medicines and from those living in hostels,” Shitole said.

The request must contain details like name, contact number, full address, specific purpose of travel, travel date, destination and time of pickup. A tweet with the same details can be sent to @RahulShitole11. Only one person wearing a mask will be allowed in an autorickshaw. Hand sanitizers will be provided by the drivers

NEW DELHI: Traders of Connaught Place have opened their hearts to support people who can’t find anything to eat because of the lockdown. New Delhi Traders Association (NDTA) has set up a ""Good Samaritan kitchen"" which offers free lunch and dinner to about 350 people in the time of coronavirus crisis. The beneficiaries include guards deployed at nearby shops and ATMs, sanitation workers, petrol pump employees and other stranded and needy people.

The noble thought of starting a kitchen for poor people struck the traders three days ago when they realised that those guarding their shops were struggling to find food. Due to the lockdown, all the dhabas are closed in the area and the guards can’t even go back to their hometown.

“Most of them stay in the shops only. After the lockdown was announced for 21 days and everything was shut down, these people started facing difficulty in finding food. We discussed the issue with police and New Delhi Municipal Council. After they gave their permission, we managed to get curfew passes for cooks and subsequently started the kitchen for the guards. Later, we started offering food to NDMC sanitation staff and other needy also,” said Vikram Badhwar, secretary of NDTA.

The ""Good Samaritan kitchen"" has been set up with the help of QBA restaurant.

“We were initially supplying food packets for 200-250 people daily. However, the demand kept on increasing. Now, we distribute 350 food packets twice a day,” said Aditya Jain, owner of QBA restaurant.

“Safety of staff and people is our priority. While we maintain social distancing during food distribution, local police and NDMC staff are also helping us in distribution of food packets at different locations,” added Jain.

Other members of the association are doing their bit by distributing fruits, sanitisers, masks and even boxes for packaging food material.

Amit Gupta, a NDTA member, said that the trader association is committed to serve humanity and support the administration in every possible manner. “We have other restaurants, including Embassy and Bill Chill, which have agreed to help with food and distribution material,” he said, adding that the service will continue till the lockdown continues.

117,['31/03/2020'],"Virus won’t kill, being jobless will: Migrant workers","JAIPUR: Kamal Singh is jobless and homeless but fearless. Tears roll down his cheeks, but there is still a spark of determination in his eyes. For the moment, he is not worried about coronavirus , the lockdown or even the sealing of inter-state borders. All he wants is to safely take his wife Jyoti Devi and 4-year-old son David to their Etawah home in Uttar Pradesh On a mission to cover a distance of 1,100 km, passing through three states — Gujarat, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh — they are still 400 km away from home.A house painter at Chandoria in Ahmedabad who earned around Rs 12,000 a month, he along with his wife and kid have already covered almost 680 km from his workplace to Jaipur mostly on foot barring a few lifts in trucks and tempos here and there in the last three days.Asked why he is crying, Kamal said, “I am worried about my son. He is just a kid and has to go through all this. I am not worried about myself. All that matters to me is the well-being of my wife and son. I have to get them home without harm. The virus won’t kill us, joblessness will,” said Kamal while talking to TOI at Adarsh Nagar.He is aware that such a reverse migration could bring the pandemic from cities to villages where healthcare facilities are grossly inadequate. “We started from Ahmedabad at 10am yesterday (Saturday). On the way we took rides on tempos, small trucks and buses and walked the rest of the distance. We reached Jaipur this morning. Since 8am, we have been walking. From here, I will go to Agra and head towards Pali Khurd village in Etawah. We ate whatever we got on the way. If we manage to get any vehicle, we will board it…Let’s see…I am not left with a single penny,” he said inconsolably.The only saving grace was that they did not go hungry, thanks to various NGOs who are on the job of feeding thousands of migrant workers to their best of capacity.“The lockdown snatched my job. I took a loan of Rs 1,000 from my contractor but now I am penniless and we are still around 400 km away from home. There were around 20 of us who were working as painters. All have left Ahmedabad,” he said.“My kid has also been walking with us for miles. I want to carry him on my shoulders but I have a heavy bag which I need to carry. That’s our only possession. I just can’t hold my tears seeing my son trudge along with us with his tender feet,” he said.Jyoti Devi is shattered too. She is worried on what the future has in store for them. “It was an okay job. We were happy and satisfied. I don’t know from where this virus hit us leading to this lockdown,” she said.Like Kamal, her only worry is also about their son. “He has been walking without any complaints. Why is God so cruel,” she complained.So what’s next? Kamal doesn ’t have any answers. For the time being, getting back home is his only target. “Let’s see. I can’t tell you what’s in store,” he said.",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74905843,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-70256,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/virus-wont-kill-being-jobless-will-migrant-workers/articleshow/74902526.cms

PRAYAGRAJ: Amid closure of courts due to lockdown in the state, the Allahabad High Court on Monday, while accepting urgency of the matter, suspended sentence of a 94-year-old convict in a murder case and directed him to be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs 5,000 only.

Hearing a criminal appeal filed by one Suryavansh of Gorakhpur district , a division bench comprising Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Siddhartha Varma passed the above order and directed the state counsel to ensure compliance of the order at the earliest and file compliance report within a week.

The petitioner had filed a criminal appeal challenging his conviction and sentence passed by sessions court of Gorakhpur on January 24, 2020, in a murder case.

The court while suspending the sentence of the convict considering his old age said, “The crime occurred on March 28, 1978, and at that time, age of Suryavansh was 40 years. It is brought to our notice that Suryavansh is now 94 years old.”

“Having considered this aspect of the matter, we are inclined to allow this application. Accordingly, the bail application is allowed. The sentence awarded to Suryavansh is suspended till the disposal of appeal,” said the bench.

Besides, the court directed additional government advocate, who was representing the state government, to ensure compliance of the order at the earliest and file a compliance report within a week.

RAJKOT: When Ravi Gundela leaves home at 6am , his 3-year-old daughter is still fast asleep blissfully ignorant of the hazards that her father daily undertakes in order to keep his small family safe.

A petrol pump attendant, Gundela’s job does not permit him to work from home, an advantage most of his neighbours, friends, and relatives are having under the lockdown.

But thanks to an informed wife, Gundela follows the safety rules to the T — from mask and gloves to washing hands and using sanitizer — he is battle-ready the moment he steps out to work. Fearing that her husband may get infected with Covid-19 virus, and worse still, he may be a carrier of the virus affecting the family, she keeps herself updated on every latest bit of information available on newspapers and television.

Gundela’s duty at the petrol pump near Ramapir Chokdi on 150 feet Ring Road starts at 6:30am and ends at 2:30pm. “I consider it as a seva and my duty at this time of crisis. Petrol falls under essential commodities, so we are required to remain on duty. Even when customers rush in, I use my own judgement to give petrol looking at the genuineness of the customer. We remain on duty to provide petrol to vehicles engaged in providing essential services in the city,” said Gundela, who earns Rs 10,000 every month.

Stating that he comes across a variety of people every day, some who thank him with a smile to those arguing endlessly for change, Gundela said that he takes it all in his stride. “I see appreciation in the eyes of people I serve, thanking us for working for them. Many people come apprehensively fearing we may turn them back, but after getting the fuel they feel extremely grateful,” he added with a smile, happy to be of help to the needy.

Gopal Chudasama, owner of the petrol station where Gundela is employed, said, “Though the demand for fuel has decreased by 80 per cent, we have to keep our petrol station open but as fuel falls under essential commodities. People from nearby areas who are engaged in emergency services like ambulance come to fill fuel in the vehicles.”

120,['31/03/2020'],Community kitchens rise up to the occasion,"Volunteers feed stray animals in the city on Monday

PRAYAGRAJ: In a bid to offer meals to migrant workers, poor and homeless during the lockdown, volunteers of the Om Namay Shiva – a religious and spiritual organisation which used to serve pilgrims during Kumbh, Ardh Kumbh and Magh Melas – has set up a community kitchen at Gau Ghat to cater to around 20,000 people daily.

Head of the organisation Prabhu Ji told TOI that a team of 30 volunteers has been engaged to prepare food packets for the migrants and homeless people. District and police officers would distribute these packets among the needy, he said adding that “on Monday, we prepared the meal for 4,000 people. They were served food packets in the morning and evening.”

From Tuesday, meal for 20,000 people would be prepared and for that, hi-tech machines have been brought for kneading flour and cutting vegetables, making the volunteers’ job a little easier.

The organisation used to serve around 50,000 pilgrims daily during Kumbh, Ardh Kumbh and at other religious gatherings. The organisation has brought two flour kneading and three vegetable cutting machines from Gujarat. Both the machines have been installed at its Gau ghat kitchen. A volunteer said, “Automatic hi-tech machines would make volunteers’ task a litter easier and we would be able to serve the needy.”

The organisation has also set up community kitchens in Lucknow and Kanpur. While organisation is preparing meal for 50,000 people in Kanpur, meal for 25,000 has been prepared by its volunteers in Lucknow.

Meanwhile, traders associated with Civil Lines Vyapaar Mandal distributed food packets among migrants and homeless people at Thornhill Road, Hanuman Mandir, Civil Lines and adjoining areas. A team of traders led by Sushil Kharbanda , president of the the Civil Lines Vyapaar Mandal distributed food packets in the morning and evening hours.

“We have set up a small kitchen to prepare meals and we are trying to reach out to the poor,” he added.

At the same time, many Samaritans are forgetting about the importance of social distancing while going around streets to distribute relief materials among those stranded because of the lockdown. With a vaccine or cure yet to be discovered for novel coronavirus, doctors have vehemently advocated that people practise social distancing to keep Covid-19 at bay.

At most shelters in the city, inmates can be seen sitting in close groups, right next to each other without maintaining the mandatory distance of at least a metre.

At shops too, residents are failing to stand apart in their hurry to buy essential commodities.

At KP community Centre on MG Road, workers who had come for a medical checkup being conducted by the administration, were seen sitting too close to each other on Monday, ignoring precautionary.

“One has to understand that helping the poor and others is a noble cause and the administration appreciates the Good Samaritans’ efforts, but residents have to ensure that they protect themselves as well as those who are stranded,” said Prayagraj district magistrate Bhanu Chandra Goswami .

121,['31/03/2020'],CSIR-NCL to soon submit R&amp;D of making raw material for drugs,"Pune: The CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory will help in making raw material (Key Starting Material) to make active pharmaceutical ingredients used to make many bulk drugs in the time of Covid-19.

The Indian pharmaceutical industry is the third-largest by volume, but is critically dependent on imports of raw material. The dependency, in some cases, extent to over 80%, particularly from China.

A senior researcher at National Chemical Laboratory (NCL) said, “If the lockdown continues for a longer duration, there may be a time in future when the pharmaceutical companies may face a shortage of raw material to make drugs. India has one of the largest number of Food and Drug Administration-approved manufacturing sites, outside the US. We supply the final drugs to a lot of countries, including China. But we need self-sufficiency. We at NCL will make the technology that helps create the Key Starting Material.”

CSIR-NCL director Ashwini Kumar Nangia said, “We are hopeful that the CSIR-NCL will be able to soon release the research and development (R&D) reports to the government and chemical and pharmaceutical industry bodies. Each laboratory-scale process will be ready in the next few weeks and months to be taken up for manufacturing by the Indian drug companies. The capability and infrastructure for further synthesis of the final active pharmaceutical ingredients from the intermediate Key Starting Material largely exist in the country.”

Another NCL researcher said, “Projects are already on for manufacturing 3-4 Key Starting Material. For another 4-5 Key Starting Material, the process to manufacture it is already designed. This has been done keeping in mind the cost, safety and other parameters.”

122,['31/03/2020'],Unsung warriors: Cop leaves ailing father; another postpones marriage to respond to call of duty,"DEHRADUN: While doctors, health staff and sanitary workers are engaged in the frontline fight against Covid-19, the men and women in khaki are also putting their best foot forward in this battle.

Take 26-year-old constable Champa Mehra for instance. Her father Ram Singh is fighting for life in a hospital in Haldwani but Mehra put her duty above her family and foregoing the leave she had taken to take care of her father, rode her motorcycle for 290-km to reach Dehradun to take her place in the police control room where she is handling hundreds of calls daily from people who are affected due to the lockdown. “With lockdown being announced, I decided that I will return to Dehradun at the earliest as the control room plays an important role in an emergency situation. Leaving my father behind with my siblings, I rode my motorycle from Nainital to Dehradun to reach as fast as I could,” Mehra told TOI.

The police control room is receiving around 9,000 to 10,000 calls per day. Of which, Mehra said that she was handling around 300 to 400 calls each day. “Almost all of them are from people, who do not have food or there is an immediate health issue. There is a staff of 54 call operators, who work in eight-hour shifts in the control room. I know that my father is extremely critical but at the same time, it is important to save thousands of people in this mega fight against Covid-19,” said the constable.

It is a similar story for 30-year-old Laeek Ahmed, who is posted at Civil Lines police station at Roorkee. Ahmed postponed his marriage to be on the field during this critical time saying “my conscience was not allowing me to go on leave when my colleagues are in the frontline to tackle this threat.” Ahmed’s wedding was scheduled for April 5 this year.

When asked whether he took the decision of postponing his marriage in consultation with his would-be-wife, Ahmed said, “She totally supported my decision and so did my family. Although her family initially wanted the marriage to take place on time, but later, they also supported my decision.”

During the lockdown, Ahmed is now doing a 12-hour daily shift in different places of Roorkee. “I am doing my bit to enforce the lockdown effectively and convincing people to stay at home, so that we can win this battle against the disease,” he said.

Meanwhile, Dehradun SSP/DIG Arun Mohan Joshi praised the efforts of his team in handling the situation. “Apart from these two instances, there are several other police personnel cooking food for people in need, providing them the required assistance and also distributing water and food packets to needy people.”

A year ago, we incubated a company with STP. We are working on a model with them, which will be effective in 1km radius.”Jadhav, a former employee of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, said he used to put aside 20% of his salary every month for research. “These machines cost about Rs 40,000 each.

This starts a continuous chain reaction in its vicinity. Unlike other micro-organisms, viruses cannot live on their own as they are just a strand of RNA with a protein cover.

Eunuchs in Godhra and Vadodara are going from door-to-door to distribute food or supplying it to the needy ones through NGOs since the lockdown came into effect.

“We do not have any businesses and the money that we have is of the society. So today since the society is in need, we are only giving it back but in different form. Never in my life of 55 years, I have seen such days,” said Kalpana Kunwar of Baranpura in Vadodara.

Eunuchs in Godhra started distributing grains, milk, water and other essential items in slums from Saturday.

Puja said that within two days they have distributed food and grains in 300 houses and are planning to reach out to many more . “For next two days we are making food packets and giving them to NGOs so they can distribute to people walking back to their homes on highways. Monday onwards we will be distributing rice, dried snacks, oil and masalas,” said Kalpana.

“When we go to people’s homes, we ask for money as we consider it as our right and give our blessings but today time is such that we are trying to give people more than our blessings,” Puja added.

139,['31/03/2020'],‘Premature to say Indian strain of virus less virulent’,"Hyderabad: Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) scientists have said it is “scientifically unsound and premature” to speculate that novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) India strain is less virulent than the ones creating havoc in China, Italy and other countries.

CCMB began sequencing the genome of the virus extracted from Hyderabad samples. The scientists hope to soon sequence Maharasthra and Rajasthan samples too.

Of the 2,077 novel coronavirus genomes that were sequenced across the world, available on Nextstrain, an open-source pathogen genome data, only two were from India, both from samples in Kerala.

CCMB director Dr Rakesh Mishra told TOI that sequencing of at least 50 genomes of the virus should be done from samples from various states to understand the strain better and know the rate of mutation and genetic similarities with the one in , China.

“We have received ICMR kits and samples from Gandhi Hospital. While we do diagnostic tests for confirmation of corona positive patients, we will be sequencing the genome of the virus. So far, only two samples from Kerala were sequenced nationally. The virus is variable, and there is a need for more sequencing to understand the biology of the virus and the rate of mutation,” the CCMB chief said.

“We should have at least 50 to 100 genome sequences to understand the virus better,”he added. Reacting to comments of a few doctors that the Indian strain was less virulent, he said: “It is premature and scientifically unsound to comment on the virulence of the strain based on scanty data. There is too much of speculation.”

Pavitra Roychoudhury, acting instructor at the University of Washington, tweeted on Sunday, “There are only two full SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India, both from Kerala. Unless there are additional data that hasn’t been published. I am not sure how one can say anything about the strains circulating locally (sic).”

140,['31/03/2020'],Kolkata man stuck in Peru with one meal a day,"Piyush Padgil in Peru

KOLKATA: When Piyush Padgil, 33, embarked on his dream trip to Peru, little did he know that it would turn into his worst nightmare. A young professional from Ballygunge, Padgil had decided to take a trip to Machu Picchu last month. Now, he finds himself stranded in the South American country that is under curfew, with 39 other Indians. The group is currently surviving on one free meal per day.

When Padgil’s trip started on February 28, the Covid-19 threat had spread from China to South Korea. But it was still a long way from India and it didn’t really bother him. Then the disease spread to Iran and Italy, but South America was largely untouched and there were no travel bans. So he got visas to Chile and Peru and started out as planned. Padgil arrived in Chile via Madrid early in March and visited the Atacama Desert, not knowing that the situation was fast changing.

By the time he reached Arequipa in Peru, the disease had spread worldwide. Padgil could not fly back to India from Lima on March 24 as scheduled. He was the lone Indian in Arequipa, surrounded mostly by people who did not speak English. Longing for home and some sort of familiarity, Padgil called the Indian embassy in Lima.

“Though there was total curfew and getting a flight back home was impossible, the embassy put me up with 39 other Indians who had managed to reach Lima,” Padgil said. “I heard of the hardships my mom and sister are facing getting medicines for my father who recently underwent a heart surgery. I feel helpless,” Padgil said.

The condition of others is no better. Most have nearly exhausted all their money and are seeking help from family and friends back home. Sameera Khan and her husband are surviving on just the free breakfast that the hotel is providing. They were scheduled to take the flight back after a visit to Brazil, Chile and Bolivia and had almost exhausted their money when the shutdown was announced. The situation is scarier for Vrishi Reddy (27), a Bengaluru-based child rights activist. She is now stuck in a lodge in remote south-eastern Peru with the nearest village 10km away. She has ration for just five meals.

The group is now awaiting an evacuation as Italy, Ireland, Switzerland and Israel have started to fly their citizens back. They wonder if the embassy will provide them food and shelter for the remainder of their stay there.

143,['31/03/2020'],"With no farmhands to harvest and no transport, farmers stare at severe loss","Coimbatore: With no farm labourers available due to the ongoing 21-day lockdown, farmers from the district say they stare at huge losses as they cannot harvest vegetables in time and transport them to markets.

Especially, vegetables such as tomato and ladies finger need to be harvested regularly or they would become overripe and get wasted, they said.

Coconut farmers too said they were facing the same issue with no workers being available to climb trees and harvest coconuts.

Farmers in Thondamuthur, Madukkarai, Kinathukadavu, Annur, Mettupalayam, Sirumugai and Pollachi were all facing the issue, they said.

Also, with no proper logistics available to transport produce to markets due to the lockdown, farmers said there must be an alternative such as a volunteer group which would take produce directly from farms to homes.

Farmers said in many places, farmhands used to come from a radius of 10km to 15km. But due to the lockdown, that is no possible. Now, even with workers from nearby areas not been coming out due to the lockdown, they said harvest and loading work have not been done for the past one week.

P Kandasamy, president of a farmers’ association here, said because of this, crops such as banana, brinjal, chillies, gourds which were ready for harvest, now face a risk of getting wasted.

“There are no machines to harvest these and it has to be done manually. If they are not harvested in the proper time, they will go waste,” he said.

A Karthik Krishnakumar, a farmer from the district and the youth wing president of the farmer’s association, said vegetables such as ladies finger were delicate and had to be harvested once in two days. “If it has to be harvested today, it has to be done. Otherwise, it will get over-mature and can’t be sold in markets. We have to sell them off to hotels for half the price. Now with hotels also not working, they probably would go waste,” he said.

Similarly, in coconut trees, mature nuts must be harvested once in 50 days, or else, they would grow over ripe and hinder the growth of younger bunches, Karthik said.

“It has been more than two months since coconut was harvested in several places due to shortage of farmhands,” he said.

One possible solution for this was to work out a community alternative such as a volunteer group taking produce from the farm to consumers directly, which would save a lot of hassles, Kandasamy said.

“At such a time, we must come together and put in a cooperative effort to tide over our difficulties,” he added.

144,['31/03/2020'],"Migrant workers returning to UP ‘sanitised’ with bleach, health min blames ‘over-zealous’ officials, probe on","wetfew

Bareilly: Several batches of migrant workers, including women and children, who arrived in UP from Delhi/NCR in government-run buses over the weekend were made to squat on a road in Bareilly district and sprayed with sodium hypochlorite — a bleaching agent which authorities later admitted was “unfit for use on humans” — in a bid to sanitise them.

After the incident on Sunday attracted widespread criticism, joint secretary (health ministry), Lav Agarwal, blamed it on the “over zealousness of officials who acted out of fear”. The secretary clarified that this was not part of any protocol and was not required.

The Bareilly district administration has now set up a team to investigate the matter. District magistrate Nithish Kumar said treatment would be provided to anybody adversely affected by spraying of sodium hypochlorite. The DM also attributed the incident to “over-cautious” personnel. “They should not have done this, but fortunately no one was harmed,” he told TOI.

Mayor Umesh Gautam admitted “negligence on part of the municipal corporation” and said directions have been issued to not repeat this in future.

Ingestion of sodium hypochlorite can cause nausea, vomiting, burns to the mouth and throat. It is corrosive and can irritate the skin or cause inflammation and blisters.

The incident occurred after a sanitisation team from the municipal corporation and fire personnel were sent to sanitise the locality of a Covid-19 patient. While returning, they reached Satellite Bus Stand in the city and were disinfecting buses when they started spraying the solution on those who were arriving in the vehicles as well.

A video of the incident shows personnel directing people to close their eyes as the bleaching agent gushes out of a hosepipe and cops look on. Senior superintendent of police (Bareilly) Shailesh Pandey has claimed that police was not involved in any way in the exercise.

Municipal commissioner (Bareilly) Abhishek Anand admitted that the chemical solution was only meant for sanitising roads, walls and metallic surfaces and was “not fit for use on humans”. Chief medical officer Vineet Shukla also added that the solution was likely diluted else it could have had adverse effects.

In a press conference later, Awanish Kumar Awasthi, additional chief secretary (home), defended its use, claiming that sanitisers can be sprayed on any person without fear as per international norms.

Later in the day, BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya tweeted that agencies in Kerala are mass spraying people, “…But all the outrage is only reserved for UP, because a saffron clad monk of the BJP is the chief minister and he is doing a good job.” Kerala officials were quick to clarify. “We have not used any kind of chemical or disinfectant on humans. What was sprayed by our personnel at Wayanad was diluted soap solution,” said director General of fire and rescue force, A Hemachandran.

Priyanka Gandhi shared a video of it on Twitter on Monday, calling it an ‘inhuman act’.

“Today (Monday) the market received 3,732 quintals of onion and 2,695 quintals of potato as against the collective arrival of up to 14,000 quintals of these produces during normal days. The less arrival has had an impact on the retail rates,” Babasaheb Bibave, the head of the onion, potato and fruits division in the Gultekdi market told TOI.

A kg of onion was sold for Rs 20-22 in the wholesale market, while potato was sold for Rs22-25 per kg. The price was expected to go up to Rs 35-40 per kg in the retail market, he said.

The Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) officials stated that the commission agents had not opened their shops and the farmers in their contact did not bring their produce to the market on Monday. Hence, the price of these items went up in the auction.

“This won’t continue for long and the prices would come down by Rs2-4 per kg once the usual arrivals begin from April 1,” Bibave said.

The retail vendors from various local markets pointed out that they had to pay extra money for the transportation of vegetables, including onion and potato, and fruits.

Sachin Pingle, a retail vendor from Vishrantwadi, said, “Only licensed vehicles are allowed in the market. These transporters are charging extra and we have to sell every item at a higher price.”

The APMC chief, Balasaheb Deshmukh, said there was adequate vegetables, onions, potatoes and fruits in the market. “As hotels, restaurants and messes are closed, the current arrivals are enough to fulfil the domestic demand. People need not stock vegetables and fruits or rush to the market,” he said.

147,['31/03/2020'],Social distancing? Niranjanpur mandi see high footfall,"Dehradun: The office bearers and traders at the Niranjanpur wholesale vegetable market (subzi mandi) say they are trying hard to maintain the norms of social distancing but are facing a tough time as the market sees heavy footfall during the time it is briefly opened during the lockdown.

Traders said that since a lot of individual buyers had also started coming to the market ever since the lockdown was announced, the mandi parishad has changed the timings of opening the market to between 2 am and 6 am.

Talking to TOI, Vijay Thapliyal, secretary of Niranjanpur Mandi Parishad said, “Our aim is to prevent crowds from gathering inside the market. The loaders and other retail traders are being allowed inside only with a valid pass. In addition to that, masks and sanitisers have been made mandatory for protection of all.” The traders say they are also making sure that for general buyers, the vegetables are made available in nearby residential areas to prevent people from coming inside the mandi.

Thapliyal added, “Some traders have also initiated the service for providing vegetables online to comply with the norms of social distancing. The entry passes for loaders are also being issued in a limited manner.”

According to the officials, the market place is being sanitised once the loaders leave the place.

Mandi inspector Ajay Dabral told TOI, “We are prohibiting entry inside the mandi without a mask. Use of sanitisers and hand wash is also being promoted to prevent the spread of the virus.”

Traders also claimed that the decision of keeping away the general buyers has helped in keeping the prices of vegetable under control.

Deepak Arora, a trader at the vegetable market said, “Earlier, with many individual buyers coming to the market, the prices had shot up having ripple effect on buyers purchasing from retailers later. Now the prices are under control, which is also in the interest of the general people in times of crisis when essential goods should be within the reach of everyone.”

The Kerala Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC), which runs the marina, directed them to stay inside the boats during the lockdown period.

BENGALURU: Primary and secondary education minister S Suresh Kumar pulled up schools for issuing circulars to parents asking them to pay fees for the next academic year and warned the managements of stringent action.

Retailers will be able to open their shops till 11 am.

A relaxation in the lockdown is being given each day between 4am and 11am.

District Magistrate Brahm Dev Ram Tiwari said that to ensure that there is no shortage of essential items with retailers, they have been allowed to make purchase from the wholesellers who have now been allowed to keep their establishments open. For home delivery of daily need items, till Sunday night, over 800 shop onwers had got themselves registered.

163,['31/03/2020'],India Covid 19 news: ‘India still in local transmission stage’,"More on Covid-19

NEW DELHI: Covid-19 outbreak in India remains in ‘local transmission’ stage and any evidence of ‘ community transmission’ will be shared with the public so that the level of alertness can be increased, the government said seeking to put at rest speculations about a wider spread of the virus.“It is only local transmission in the country. If there is a community transmission, we will be the first to tell you as we would want to covey it to the community through you (media) to increase the level of alertness and management for Covid-19 at the field level,” health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said.The clarification comes in the wake of a government document detailing standard operating procedures (SOP) for transporting a suspected case of coronavirus or Covid-19. “This SOP is applicable to the current phase of COVID-19 pandemic in India (local transmission and limited community transmission),” the document said, the words in the bracket sending speculation soaring about government announcing community spread.“We have to get out of these semantics. We have used the word in a very limited context in a way to highlight what we are going to do in terms of action at field. Nowhere we said we have community transmission. It is only local transmission in the country. The document very clearly mentions that we are in a phase of local transmission,” Agarwal said.Government officials said that criticism that India is not testing enough fail to take into account the effort being made to test all serious cases of respiratory distress and ICU patients with SARI (severe acute respiratory infections) and that state governments of all political hues are involved in the exercise. They pointed out that any significant increase in Covid-19 patients cannot go unnoticed as they would turn up at clinics and hospitals. It was unlikely that with so many medical professionals and agencies involved such a development remains a secret.The government has so far maintained that there is no clear evidence of the virus spreading into the community where the links of transmission cannot be traced. This even as there are sporadic cases of severe respiratory infection testing positive for Covid-19 without travel or contact history. Similarly, on Monday, Dr Gangakhedkar, head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medicl Research (ICMR) said some asymptomatic cases have tested positive but are not enough to indicate community transmission.In both the cases – SARI and asymptomatic cases testing positive – ICMR has maintained that the sample size is miniscule to consider them as evidence to community spread. So far, India has tested 38,442 samples for COVID-19. The government and ICMR maintains that there is adequate testing capacity to ramp up testing sample size if required.According to Dr Gangakhedkar, India is currently using only 30% of its testing capacity in public laboratories. There are a total of 115 public laboratories with capability to test over 12,000 samples a day. In addition to this, the Council has also approved 47 private labs which conducted 1,334 tests in last three days.However, some experts are of the view that it is time for India to ramp up testing now to convincingly rule out community transmission based on larger sample size and secondly, to be able to use healthcare and financial resources in a more targeted way.“We need frontload of testing. The testing protocol now has to become more aggressive and stratified. We have the capacity to test and to reserve for a time when we reach the stage of community transmission is pointless,” says Shamika Ravi , director of research at Brookings India.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74903154,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-578075,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-still-in-local-transmission-stage/articleshow/74903148.cms

JAIPUR: Anticipating a situation when the state might require more ventilators for Covid-19 patients, the health department is not only purchasing more ventilators, but it is also contemplating the idea for placing multiple patients on a single mechanical ventilator.

The health department has already conducted a demonstration and also it is examining its feasibility in the state. However, no decision has been taken yet. “Currently, we have enough ventilators. In future, we may require more. For purchasing new ones, we have already issued orders. However, we are taking technical advise on how to use one ventilator for multiple patients,” said health minister Raghu Sharma .

Patients, who have difficulty in breathing due to lung diseases, require ventilator support. In the state, it is estimated that 1,500 ventilators are available in private and government sectors. Reacting on use of one ventilator for multiple patients, experts claimed that it should be done cautiously.

“There are many technical aspects associated with it. If a ventilator is used for multiple users, it should be used cautiously. The distance between patients and ventilators should remain same. Also severity of disease and weight of patients are also important. Patients with equal weight and same severity of disease can use single ventilator. It is must be that if one ventilator is used for multiple patients, it has to be used cautiously,” said Dr Virendra Singh , one of the seven-member advisory committee constituted by the government on Covid-19.

However, one of the private hospitals in the city has started using one ventilator for multiple patients. For placing multiple patients on a single mechanical ventilators, it is required to attach hoses to one ventilator.

Sandeep Bakshi, chancellor of the university to which the hospital is attached said, “This initiative was propelled by the shortage of ventilators everywhere, thereby putting lives at risk. This technique also promises to be much cheaper.” The private hospital advocated that such ventilator is to be used only during crisis conditions like Covid-19 pandemic on similar kind of patients to avoid risk of cross infections.

In Dehradun, National Association for Parents and Students’ Rights (NAPSR) is providing free food to more than 500 people in need on a daily basis. The association told TOI that this drive will continue till the timne there is a lockdown in the city.

“We are providing free food at various locations of Dehradun. There is a large section of the population that is struggling to get a daily meal due to the Covid-19 lockdown. We are catering to more than 500 people daily and now, we have started with providing evening tea to police personnel on duty. Since the drive has started, we have covered several areas of Dehradun like Ajabpur Kalan, ISBT, Azad Colony, DL Road, and Sahastradhara Road,” said Arif Khan, NAPSR president.

Many residents have also taken it upon themselves to feed stray animals during the lockdown. A group called ‘Save The Stray During Lockdown’ was created a few days back on Facebook in order to provide a common platform to those who are willing to help the stray animals.

“The stray animals are completely dependent on the leftovers at markets, groceries, restaurants and others. As these establishments have been shut, stray animals are going without food. Thus, ‘Save The Stray During Lockdown’ was created. Fortunately, we have witnessed an overwhelming response as more than 200 people have joined our group in such a short time. Many people are providing us with food supplies for the stray animals. Anyone can join the group by giving us a call at 8920367282.

Kochi: With lockdown in place, there has been a surge in demand for the e-commerce market. As a result, lots of news applications offering home delivery of groceries and vegetables have come up. Residents, unable to stroll around, turn to these apps to buy essentials. However, most of these apps are either not working or are unserviceable.

When a customer tries to contact the number provided on these apps, it remains on busy mode. Supermarkets, vegetable and fruit sellers and other shoppers promise online delivery asking people to order it at a specific time. However, when one attempts to do so, the app either crashes or remains unresponsive.

Meanwhile, there are certain apps that take orders, but the delivery get delayed to surge in demand. “We have checked almost all apps that promises home delivery but no avail. It consumes a lot of time to add products to the cart. Finally, when we try to place the order, the app crashes. While these has been a surge in demand for vegetables and fruits, ordering them online is, however, not possible. While, some admins clearly say that they have stopped taking orders due to Covid-19, others take orders for selected grocery items only. But it takes minimum four days to deliver them,” says Renjitha, a resident in Kadavanthra.

Meanwhile, Supplyco has started home delivery of groceries with the support of an online platform. “We have launched a home delivery system on trial basis within 8km radius of the city and it’s been huge success. We receive around 150 orders per day,” said Supplyco M D Ali Asgar Pasha.

Horticorp too launched online service with the support of an online platform in Ernakulam, but many customers find it difficult to place orders. “We got 1,800 orders for various products including, egg, milk and vegetables on Sunday and 3,000 orders on Monday. We cannot control the orders due to huge rush of customers. We have been forced to stop receiving orders within one hour of opening the app in the morning,” claimed official of the online platform.

On the issue of transporting essential commodities, transport secretary K R Jyohilal said government has issued 50,000 vehicle passes to district collectors in the state. “Once the vehicles get passes for transporting essential goods, things will pick up,” he said.

KANPUR: A 45-year-old man was stabbed to death in broad daylight allegedly by his nephew over property dispute in Rail Bazar area of the city on Monday.

Rail Bazar inspector Dadhibal Tiwari said, “Around 11 am, police were informed that one Suresh of Kumhar Mandi had been stabbed.” When the team arrived at the spot, Suresh had already been rushed to a nearby hospital .

However, after his condition deteriorated, doctors referred him to Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital, where he died during treatment.

Preliminary investigations revealed that the victim, who was on his way to get some work done with regard to procurement of a ration card, had a scuffle with his nephew Sunil, said police.

“Sunil used to live with his maternal uncle but was forced to leave by the latter about four years ago owing to his drinking habit. This enraged Sunil, who had been picking up fights with Suresh on several occasions since then. He even made claims on his property,” said an investigator.

Sunil tried to escape the scene after stabbing Suresh, but was nabbed by the locals of the area. They thrashed him severely before handing him over to the police.

""Sunil was taken into custody and is being interrogated. Body was sent for postmortem. An FIR has been lodged under relevant sections of IPC. Investigations are on,"" said police.

184,['31/03/2020'],Shelves at many grocery stores bare as stocks fail to arrive; veggie rates stable,"Police ensure social distancing is maintained by citizens queuing up at APMC market in Vashi on Monday

Mumbai: The state’s plan for grocery shops to remain open 24/7 seems a tall order as groceries in the city are failing to work even normal hours due to disruption in supply chains. On the other hand, vegetable supplies have stabilized and consequently prices too. The surfeit of 800 vegetable trucks that arrived in APMC Vashi on Saturday against the daily normal of 550 had a trickle down effect on prices in Mumbai. Rates remained stable at Rs 60-80 per kg in most parts of the city.

By contrast, supermarkets, real and virtual, as well as neighbourhood kirana stores are displaying bare shelves as shop owners have been unable to replenish stocks. Some like Sweet Home Supermarket in Lokhandwala Complex, Andheri, the largest in the locality, closed for business on Monday. Others are operating fewer hours. The owner of Prince Store in the same locality said, “There is no transport, no loaders, no drivers, so the supply chain is broken.”

Even basic salt, dal and rice are in short supply in Pali Market as are biscuits and noodles. Elsewhere, soap and detergent are not available.

In Panchpakhadi, Thane, kirana stores wore a bare look. Resident Anand Viswanathan said, “I visited three stores before I could find salt.”

Mediaperson Naina Roy visited Big Bazaar in Vashi. She said, “Stocks were patchy with fewer fruits and vegetables than the previous Sunday. Also, it was depleted of frozen foods such as sausages, parathas and green peas.”

Vegetable supplies did not pose a grave problem Monday given that 800 vehicles came in Saturday. APMC authorities on Monday restricted entry only to licence or card holders. This decision reduced footfalls by 70%.

As kitchens were shut and procuring food for critical staff in a multinational bank’s offices in Mumbai and Bengaluru became difficult, Vijay R from a corporate cafeteria management firm directly wrote to the CEO of MTR Foods.

“I found the email ID online and was surprised to get an immediate response from the team. Ready-to-eat meals were delivered in just a couple of days as per our requirement,” he said.

Sunay Bhasin, chief marketing officer, MTR Foods, said they have been working relentlessly to supply meals, wherever they can.

HYDERABAD: A song writer’s midnight stroke of creativity has turned out to be a chartbuster that is being used to create awareness against the spread of novel coronavirus in Telangana. The song ‘Chethuleththi mokkutha’ is currently a hot favourite on social media to drive home the message against the virus.

“It is not about me feeling happy because the song is doing well. The only reason behind composing the song was that I felt socially responsible,” songwriter Ram Miriyala told TOI.

In addition to the popular song, films stars — Chiranjeevi, Nagarjuna, Sai Dharam Tej and Varun — have also come up with a song ‘We got to fight corona edhemaina.’

Several others like Balu Kampally Swaero have also come up with songs to create an awareness on the coronavirus and the precautions to be taken. Some are also rephrasing old filmi dialogues, as Maruthi Ram has done, urging caution. Siddhala Hussain came out with a folk song. Manasa Acharya reworked the lyrics of the famous Mohammed Rafi song ‘Sepaayi o sepaayi’ to spread awareness about covid.

But, 32-year-old Ram Miriyala’s song has stolen the march over others. Ram, has also written a few popular songs for his band ‘ChowRaasta,’ including the hugely popular ‘Oerelipotha mama,’ which garnered more than four millions views. In just four days, ‘Chethuleththi mokkutha’ got 2.4 millions views on YouTube. “It is fulfilling to know that the song is serving its purpose. The focus should entirely be on the song and not me,” Ram, who worked for a radio channel until recently, said.

TRICHY: Despite the crackdown against curfew violators, people continued to venture out unmindful of the risk of being infected by Covid-19 in central region of Tamil Nadu on Monday. In Trichy city, 48 cases were booked and more than 100 people were arrested on Sunday. Instead of booking each individual, the police are booking cases against a group of individuals in order to avoid piling up of cases.

The central region comprising Trichy rural, Ariyalur, Perambalur , Karur, Pudukottai, Thanjavur , Tiruvarur and Nagappattinam - has reported 1,114 cases and 1240 arrests besides the seizure of 749 vehicles including 26 four wheelers in a single day today.

Trichy district was one among the district with most cases registered day. On Monday, Trichy rural police arrested 314 people, seized 156 vehicles and booked 251 cases.

Appealing to people not to venture out from home, Trichy district SP Zia Ul Haq said, “Please cooperate and don’t venture out without strong reason. Otherwise, deterrent legal action would be taken,” SP Haq told TOI. Trichy rural police have deployed four drone cameras for surveillance, he added.

187,['31/03/2020'],More people seek travel passes to other districts,"Trichy: The collector’s office has seen a flurry of requests for passes mostly for travelling to other districts, after the disaster management department began issuing travel passes for emergency situations.

The department issues passes in extraordinary situations such as prefixed marriages, funerals and medical emergencies. Over the past few days, people began thronging the offices asking for the passes.

People have been frequenting the district collector’s office seeking passes for those not considered as emergency. However, in most cases, they are made to run from pillar to post as even officials do not have the clarity in issuing passes.

The state government had imposed Section 144 under CrPC and prevented gathering of people to prevent community spread of Covid-19. It also closed district borders to prevent travel from one district to another.

This has in a way affected essential travel that cannot be called an emergency. For instance, a professor from city college had sent his 10-year-old daughter to Vellore to his in-laws place for the vacation about two weeks back.

“I had to leave her in Vellore as my wife and I were working till last week. We had plans to bring her back over the last few days but could not do so due to the curfew,” he said.

The professor approached the district administration for a pass to travel to Vellore, but he was denied it after he was made to approach multiple offices.

A senior official from the Trichy district administration said that four passes were issued on Monday. But the office has been receiving many requests that don’t come under the categories mentioned by the state government. “Therefore, we are unable to issue the passes,” the official said.

Passes are being given to pilgrims and devotees stranded in Trichy over the last one week. While these are genuine cases who can make their own arrangement for travel, passes are issued in extraordinary medical emergency.

People suffering from cancer, kidney-related ailments, illness to newborn and funerals are also considered, the official said.

The state has given instructions on Monday that permission can be obtained from respective tahsildar to travel within the district. People need not come to the collectorate for requests. However, inter-district travel needs to be recognised by the collector.

Kallu Yadav,32, Ravi Yadav, 25, Ranu Yadav, 23, and Bipin Yadav, had been working at a textile firm in Surat but the lockdown closed their unit and erased their daily earnings, forcing them to leave for their native place.

“We had left Surat on Saturday evening by taking lifts in different vehicles ranging from loading autorickshaws to vegetable containers. We reached up to Nadiad, but from there we did not get any vehicle. So we began walking and finally reached Ahmedabad after a walk of around seven hours,” said Kallu, who was walking on SP Ring Road near Nana Chiloda Circle.

Narrating his tale of migration to Ahmedabad, Kallu said that his father was a marginal farmer with just three bighas of land at their village, and migration was the only choice left to him to earn for his family. Three others too said that they also did not have any option as they did not get education and employment opportunities.

“Stray cows spoiled our crop last year. So we were under great debt and I migrated to Gujarat,” said Ravi.

On the same SP Ring Road, a person was sitting alone tired from walking around 18km from Chanakyapuri to Nana Chiloda Circle. When asked why he was sitting there, Satpal Jatav,40, from Eta district of Uttar Pradesh said that he was a labourer of house painting work but now he desperately wanted to go home to attend his ailing daughter.

“I do not have money to survive here. In my native village, my daughter, 9, has jaundice. I wanted to go home at any cost,” said Jatav before running towards a roadside pit, when he spied a police van.

Near Bhat village, eight men, all aged between 20 and 25, were sharing a packet of glucose biscuits. One of them, Ashok Yadav, told TOI, “We were working at a factory in Kadi town of Mehsana. After the lockdown, we ran out of money so we decided to leave for our village. We did not have food. Seeing our pitiable condition a truck driver gave us a packet of biscuits which we are sharing.”

A police official said that they have instructions from superiors not to allow any migrants to leave where they were. So, the cops are not allowing any labourer to leave for their native place, he said.

Officials with tourism department said they had been providing all help for the UK citizens ever since they reached Kerala. “Even while they were admitted to the medical college, we had supplied essential commodities like tissue papers, food items, etc.,” an official with tourism department said.

According to the officials with the medical college, even the UK nationals who underwent treatment at the hospital earlier have expressed their satisfaction over the medical care given to them. “Some of them have even send messages to us. An 80-year-old UK woman wrote to us after she came to know that a British couple had complained about the “poor hygiene” and facilities at the hospital. In the message, she briefed about the tests she had underwent here and the efforts that we took for conducting the tests. She thanked us,” sources with the medical college said.

The British national, along with his wife and 17 compatriots, had tried to board a flight to Dubai from Cochin airport while they were undergoing quarantine at Tea Country Hotel in Munnar on March 15, the very day when he was tested positive for Covid-19. Eleven of them were allowed to leave the country on March 21 after they were tested negative.

HYDERABAD: Allegedly frustrated at not being able to get liquor due to the lockdown, a 40-year-old tippler in Telangana’s Siddipet attempted to end his life, police said on Monday.

The man, identified as M Yadagiri, a resident of Renuka Nagar in the town, tried to electrocute himself with live electric wires of a transformer. Police rushed to the spot and admitted the man to a hospital after they were alerted about the incident by locals at a funeral nearby. Police said that the victim was addicted to toddy and was suffering from severe withdrawal symptoms.

“At around 6 am, a local informed us about the incident at Bara Imam Chowrasta near Hanuman temple in Siddipet town. Yadagiri entered the enclosed electric transformer’s area by crossing the safety fence. He was behaving aggressively and began punching on the fuse boxes of the transformers. As sparks started emanating from the boxes, people who were in the adjacent graveyard during a funeral quickly disconnected power supply to the transformer using a stick. Power supply to the main line was also stopped with the help of electricity officials,” inspector Saidulu said.

Police took Yadagiri into custody. “Yadagiri is an alcoholic. He used to consume toddy and liquor everyday. As he could not lay his hands on alcohol, he experienced withdrawal symtoms and on Monday morning he attempted suicide by holding electric wires,” the inspector said.

Yadagiri suffered minor burns on his hands and is undergoing treatment at a local hospital in Siddipet. Police made a General Diary entry of the incident. No case was registered.

KOLKATA: Residents of an upscale highrise in Bhowanipore had to break the lockdown restrictions and rush out of their homes on Monday morning after a fire broke out on a16th floor flat of the G+20 tower. One flat was completely gutted while another was partially damaged after a gas cylinder went off due to the intensive heat. Around 10 tenders were pressed into service to bring the fire under control. None was reportedly injured or trapped inside the building.

The fire, suspected to have been caused by a short circuit at South City Galaxy on Justice Chandra Madhab Road off Ashutosh Mukherjee Avenue in Bhowanipore, was noticed around 10am. The flat (16A), where the fire broke out, belongs to the businessman Anirduddh Modi, who deals in real estate and tea. Modi, his wife and two children raised an alarm and alerted the building’s security guards. Other residents of the building were alerted about the fire through intercom.

The tenders took over four hours to douse the fire around 2.30pm. The residents of the building stood huddled on the ground car parking lot as the fire had been raging for several hours. Though fire officials brought a hydraulic lift, they could not use it as the fire reached a higher level by then.

The fire videos clicked by locals went viral on social media in a few minutes. Local councillor Ashim Bose said, “The fire brigade had a harrowing time dousing the flames. Lockdown restrictions could not be followed due to the incident. Food was served to the residents of the building in the community centre. They returned to their respective flats only after electricity was restored.” Fire minister Sujit Bose and fire services director general Jag Mohan visited the spot.

A bench of justices Sanjeev Sachdeva and Navin Chawla was also informed by the government that mohalla clinics of the northeast district were functional and the affected people would be provided with the details of nodal officers who could be contacted in case of requirement of medical assistance.

The court, which conducted the proceeding through video -onferencing in view of the restrictions due to the Covid-19 outbreak, was hearing a plea by Shaikh Mujtaba Farooq seeking direction to the authorities to re-open the relief camp at Idgah in Mustafabad and provide proper food supplies, adequate water, sanitation and security to the victims.

The government counsel also stated that the families which were staying at the camp at Idgah had voluntarily left the camp and were not removed by police or the government. Later the camp had been disbanded.

“Without getting into the controversy as to whether the families of the riot victims which were living at the camp at Idgah vacated the camp voluntarily or they were forced to vacate, the fact of the matter is that they were no longer there at the camp,” HC observed, after being informed by the government that its officers would get in touch with the persons whose names and telephone numbers had been provided by the petitioner.

The counsel added that in case any of the families require accommodation, efforts should be made to immediately place them in appropriate accommodation or relief camps. Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for the petitioner apprised the court about the issues faced by the riot victims.

The court listed the matter for April 3 for directions or reporting compliance of its order.

196,['31/03/2020'],No content: Kannada soaps in soup,"BENGALURU: A pall of gloom has enveloped the once-thriving Kannada entertainment TV industry — employing nearly 8,000 people and worth Rs 700 crore in terms of annual business — with all activity grinding to a halt on March 15 following the lockdown .

Lakhs of individual households that feast on Kannada serials and reality shows will be left in the lurch once the current bank of the content ends by April 3. Channels will be forced to repeat old TV serials and other shows, say industry insiders.

“Every serial director will have a bank of about 10-20 episodes. Since the lockdown doesn’t seem to be ending soon, this bank will get exhausted,” said Veerendra Bellichukki , secretary of Kannada Television Association (KTA).

Association sources put the annual size of the industry at Rs 700 crore. According to the association, 65 mega serials, 10 reality shows and several cookery shows are currently being telecast. B Suresha, a former KTA resident and acclaimed director, actor and theatreperson, said re-telecasting serials is not the wisest thing to do but channels don’t have options.

Bellichukki lamented that the biggest impact would be on actors, technicians, and other staff working for serials. “Those working in the TV industry get paid on daily basis and they are largely dependent on it. Due to the lockdown, they won’t be earning,” he added.

Barring the big names, the monthly earning of most people involved in the industry is between Rs 20,000-Rs 25,000, which is very less compared to that in the film industry.

197,['31/03/2020'],‘Do it yourself’ is now a lockdown mantra,"KOCHI: Praveen Nair had never tried fixing a leaking faucet before. As the plumber who used to visit his neighbourhood is forced to stay indoors due to the lockdown, he is left with no option but to try doing it himself.

“This is something completely new to me. Water was dripping, and something had to be done urgently. Hardware shops are closed. It is not possible to buy a piece to replace the damaged one. Moreover, there is no one available to do the job. I spoke to the plumber over the phone, and he gave me some quick fix solutions,” said Nair, who works as HR manager in a private firm. Queries were posted on the WhatsApp group of the apartment complex, and he managed to get the tools required for the task from his neighbour. “Another person helped me with O-rings. It took considerable time, and constant contact with the plumber over the phone to get it done,” he added.

As families and individuals remain confined within the walls of their homes, DIY ( Do IT Yourself ) has become the catch phrase. Many homes that were earlier dependent on domestic helps are now left to do everyday chores themselves. Even children are encouraged to do their bit. Housemaids have become a luxury of the past. “Cooking, cleaning, dusting and scrubbing have become shared activities. Everyone has to do their own laundry. We make our kids clean their room and bathrooms,” said Shalini Mohan, a software programmer.

While some people are dependent on families and friends for advice and tips, others manage to get information online. People check websites for easy recipes, and those who want to experiment with their culinary skills search for elaborate recipes. “It’s all about survival during crisis,” said Aswathy A, a student who returned home from a neighbouring state.

Apartment owners associations say that at least some residents have started taking interest in knowing how waste generated in their buildings are being processed. There could be times when sanitation workers would not be able to reach the apartment complex. “Some of the residents also watched the process of treating bio-waste when training was given to temporary labourers. Future is so uncertain, and it might help us,” said a representative of an apartment complex.

However, in the midst all these there is a small section trying to find their feet in the changed situations. “I am in home quarantine since my return from the UK. I do not know how to wash clothes by hand. The washing machine is placed near the kitchen, and I cannot go there. It’s also not possible to handover my clothes to other members in the family. I soak my clothes in soap and antiseptic liquids in a bucket and leave it on the staircase. Someone collects it from there. It never occurred to me that I would have to do all cleaning and moping on a regular basis. I feel sad and guilty about it,” said a student.

After the nationwide lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last Tuesday, they got stuck there as not only Maharashtra but AP and Telangana too sealed their borders. Their plight came to fore after some of them made frenetic calls to their friends and relatives in Chandrapur, who in turn, sought the administration’s help to rescue them.“Since our district is yet to witness even a single case of coronavirus, we don’t want to risk the rest of population due to few of them. I know I will be targeted from both sides after taking this harsh stand, but in larger interest of the society, I need to do it,” Wadettiwar told TOI.The state social justice minister, however, said he had conveyed their plight to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and he had spoken to his counterpart in Telangana K Chandrashekhar Rao. “The latter assured all the help to stranded persons. Even the PM had called on states to seal the borders to prevent the outbreak,” he said.The Chandrapur administration had prepared a detailed list of such citizens who are stuck up in the neighbouring state. About 4,500 are located in Khamam alone, while rest are in Mehboob Nagar, Bhadrachalam and some are at Karnataka border.“Besides CM, our collector has also established contact with their counterparts in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and they assured all help with food and shelter to our citizens. They have been taken to nearby schools where shelters are arranged for them. Fortunately for us, the collectors there are Maharashtrians and batchmates of our collector. Therefore, it has become easier for us to convince them,” Wadettiwar said.On the minister’s directives, the district administration is also transporting foodgrains and other essential commodities to places where these 9,000 people are stranded. They will be kept there till the lockdown is in place, where they will be checked. “We’ve tried to include all such persons in the list which was prepared with the help of tehsildar.

PUNE: Cyber crooks emptied an 85-year-old retired college principal’s bank account under the pretext of updating his e-wallet.

The fraudsters, between Friday and Sunday, siphoned of Rs 1.5 lakh from his the account. They even got him to share the bank account details of his wife and their married daughter, but these accounts were untouched.

When the man’s son-in-law, a medical practitioner, came to know about the fraud, he blocked the accounts to avoid further loss. He also lodged a complaint with the cyber crime police station later on Sunday.

When contacted, the complainant told TOI that his father-in-law stays in Kothrud . On Friday afternoon, the senior citizen received a text message on his cellphone telling him to update his KYC information for his e-wallet account.

“My father-in-law contacted the given cellphone number. The caller told him that his account will be shut down if he does not update the information immediately,” the complainant said.

Rattled, his father-in-law shared his details including the bank account number and debit card details with the person. A little later, he received an SMS about a Rs 25,000 debit from his bank account.

“My father-in-law immediately contacted the person and told him about the debit. The person told him that something must have gone wrong and assured him that the money would be returned,” the complainant said.

On Saturday, the person again contacted the elderly man seeking other bank account details saying that they would split the amount and return it.

“The fraudsters told my father-in-law that he could give the account details of relatives too,” the medical practitioner said. He gave the bank details of his wife and their daughter.

The same day, the suspects siphoned of Rs 25,000 more and on Sunday they emptied the bank account.

“Altogether, they siphoned Rs 1.5 lakh from the one account. We realized it was a fraud on Sunday. We filed a complaint and on Monday blocked both the accounts,” he said.

Inspector of the cyber crime police station Machhindra Pandit said they will conduct a probe.

PUNE/MUMBAI: Three persons, including two family members of the 40-year-old critically-ill Sahakarnagar man, tested positive for novel coronavirus (Covid-19) infection on Monday.

The third case is a 40-year-old resident of Baner who recently returned from Bermuda. He was quarantined at Naidu hospital two days ago. His contacts are being traced. The three fresh cases have pushed up the city’s positive tally to 43.

The Sahakarnagar man suffers from chronic liver disease. He has no history of international travel or any proximity to known infected persons or their close contacts. He has been put on ventilator support at a private hospital in the Deccan area since March 26.

Besides, the civic health officials said a 52-year-old resident of Thane, who succumbed to complications associated with the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) infection at a private hospital in Pune on Monday, diabetic.

The man developed breathlessness at his in-laws’ residence on March 22 and was admitted to hospital. “He developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). His oxygen saturation was falling rapidly following which we intubated him and put him on ventilator support the next day. His hypertensive and diabetic condition added to the complications in a short span. We could not pull him off ARDS despite putting in our best efforts,” said a doctor from the hospital.

The source of infection in seven people diagnosed with the contagion in Pune between March 20 and March 29 cannot been linked to international travel or a traceable contact to an infected person.

“Presently, the condition of two of them — a 41-year-old woman living on Sinhagad road and a 40-year-old man living in Sahakarnagar — is critical but stable. Both have tested positive for Covid-19. There is no history of international travel or proximity to known infected persons or their close contacts in their case. They are on the ventilator support,” Wavare said.

Mumbai’s tally of cases witnessed a big jump with the civic body announcing 47 new cases. However, state officials said they were still scrutinizing the civic body’s cases, so a majority of them have not yet been added to the state’s list.

Of the two fatalities from Mumbai, the civic officials chose to report only one -- of an 80-year-old heart patient at Fortis Hospital, Mulund. Sources said the man, who had hypertension and ischemic heart disease, had come to the hospital on March 28 with respiratory distress and died in the next 24 hours. He had no travel history or known contact with a traveller, sources said.

TOI learnt about the second death, which the BMC said was still under scrutiny, of an 86-year-old woman from Ghatkopar. She passed away at L H Hiranandani Hospital, Powai, at 7am on Monday, almost 10 days after her US-returned son and maid tested positive.

Despite two deaths of people having no travel history or contacts, state officials said they still can’t be called cases of community transmission. Dr Anup Yadav of the public health department said 39 patients have recovered and gone home.

A member of a Bollywood star’s family passed away late on Monday evening due to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Though his swab sample was sent for Covid-19 testing, the report is awaited. The family member, who is not into cinema, died at a private hospital in the western suburbs, a hospital source said. Though he did not stay with the star’s family, he is believed to have used the same gym in their building.

HYDERABAD: Parents of Telugu techies and other employees, who have gone to the US from both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh to stay with their wards, are stranded there as a result of the lockdown and are facing uncertain times. With no idea as to when they can come back, many of them are worried about running out of medicines and also about medications for which they cannot get local refills.

Venky Duggishetty whose parents had flown New Jersey in November 2019 are among those stuck there. “They had to leave in December, but are stranded here,” he said.

Duggishetty says his parents suffer from diabetes and blood pressure. “The problem is not change of prescription. The problem is the price of medication here. Diabetes medication is very expensive in the US.” He said if the cost of medication in India is Rs 3,600 a month, the same would cost Rs 35,000 in the US. “For now, I will buy the medicines for my parents. But, for how long I will be able to sustain I am not sure,” he said.

R Ravikanth, who lives in Texas, is facing a similar problem. He says his mother, who came to the US to help take care of his new-born daughter last year, is desperately waiting to go back to India. “She has medicines to last for a month. After that, we do not know how we will manage her medical expenses,” he said, add that he is the family’s only earning member.

Mounika Narne whose cousin is going through the same predicament said usually parents get medicines to last for six months. “Most of them may have exhausted their medicine stocks. Some are staying without medication, while others are trying hard to reach out to people to look out for any possibilities of getting them via shipments,” she told TOI.

204,['31/03/2020'],NIRDPR to help GPs monitor migrants,"Hyderabad: The National Institute of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj (NIRDPR) is launching awareness initiatives to help gram panchayats across India monitor migrants returning from cities.

According to a press release issued by the NIRDPR, the institute is providing information, education and communication (IEC) material and methodical awareness-creation modules through its newly-launched learning management portal ‘Gram Swaraj’. The initiative is aimed at helping migrants and ensuring that they are adequately screened for Covid-19 infection and quarantined where necessary.

The material would not only create awareness about safety measures such as regular washing of hands, maintaining social distancing and other directives but will also prepare gram panchayats towards ensuring that no person goes hungry, irrespective of their socio-economic background.

“There could be a number of households in each panchayat area where the migrant families who returned from urban centers lack resources for sustenance for this long period as their livelihoods may depend on daily earnings. We need to focus on them too,” said WR Reddy, director general of NIRDPR while pointing out that a system has to be created where all needy families will need to be provided with food or ration for their sustenance.

210,['31/03/2020'],Trichy: Delivery boys are working every day to ensure cooking gas at homes,"Picture used for representational purpose only

TRICHY: Ever since the lockdown , T Alagesh Kumar, 30, has been delivering LPG cylinders to houses by skipping lunch and umindful of the scorching sun. Forgoing his weekly-off, Kumar delivers at least 60 cylinders a day, each weighing around 30kg in various parts of the city.

Kumar, like his fellow LPG cylinder delivery boys starts his day by around 8am. Without public transportation, most delivery personnel who stay on the outskirts have to hitchhike a ride to their workplace. Their uniform helps them gain sympathy from drivers plying with essential commodities to drop them at the required place.

“I have not been taking lunch since Janata Curfew as the demand for LPG cylinders has pushed us to scale up deliveries each day. Once I step out of my house in the morning, I will be back home only at midnight,” Kumar told TOI.

The distance covered by delivery boys has also increased, due to panic booking, as each delivery boy covers at least 80-100km a day against their normal coverage of 40-50km. “There is a marked difference in the reception among our customers anxiously awaiting LPG cylinders during the lockdown. Now, customers value our service and give us tips voluntarily since they are in need of cylinders,” Kumar says.

Though the delivery boys are working all through the week without rest, they said there is a feeling of satisfaction in helping families beat hunger. The lockdown has made people realise the importance of those delivering goods at their doorsteps, from the milkman to delivery boys.

Interestingly, the staff members who donated blood are contractual workers of the hospital and their service tenure will end on Tuesday (March 31).Govind Prasad, one of the contractual workers at GDMCH told TOI that the hospital administration has suspended the services of 57 contractual workers. “Among the 57 people, services of 31 staffers ended in February while the last working date for others is March 31. We have been told that we won’t be getting any pay after this but we feel it’s our moral duty to help the hospital in the time of crisis.

Thereby, the medical college administration has assured to arrange passes for people who would be interested in donating blood.“The major source of blood donation for GDMCH is the camps that are organised by either the hospital itself or private players/NGOs.

212,['31/03/2020'],"They are our guests, let’s behave like hosts","Amidst the nationwide lockdown calls of ‘stay home, stay safe’, thousands of homeless casual labourers in Indian cities are among the worst-hit as a result of halted public transport, shuttered shops and uncertainty over the handling of the pandemic that was quickly spreading throughout the country.

Kerala ranked first for having migrant-friendly policies in Interstate Migrant Policy Index 2019 compiled by a Mumbai-based non-profit organization. However, news from Payippad village of Kottayam district, where hundreds of migrants protesting on the street, indicate the lapse in even better functioning systems. Their demand for transportation facilities for their return to native places shows their diffidence in the host society’s efforts of integration and wellbeing. On the other hand, what makes government interventions difficult in such situations is the negligence and non-cooperation of the contractors, who are expected to take care of the welfare and health of the labourers, in officially registering this floating population thus depriving them of their human and labour rights.

To deal with the current situation, the central as well as state governments need to immediately adopt inclusive relief measures to its marginalised communities, including the migrant guest workers. Central government ’s latest directive of closing down of state and district borders will create more panic and insecurity among migrants who are stranded in several Indian cities. To boost their trust and confidence in the host society’s governance mechanisms, on an emergency basis, they should be provided with clean and decent shelters, food, water, medical facilities and other essential supplies. Government facilities like stadiums, colleges and schools can be converted into shelters. Instead of treating them as a burden on the already overstretched system, their safety should be the priority. And, they should be encouraged to stay back wherever they are, taking into consideration the high risk of community spreading of the pandemic.

The central government should also address the welfare of the families of these inter-state migrants back home by announcing targeted relief and medical packages to reassure them that even in their absence their families left behind are taken care of. Provisions for distributing unemployment allowances to these poor and vulnerable workforces in the informal and casual labour sectors for the whole period of the lockdown are crucial. Better coordination of all the relevant ministries and departments, including the labour ministry, health departments as well as state and panchayat raj institutions, has to be ensured in delivering these people-friendly services. Government officials, especially the police, need to act with restraint while dealing with already distressed migrants.

Managing the current situation is not the end of it all. The long-term impact of this pandemic on migrant communities needs to be factored in as next exodus is going to be the return of those who have gone back to their village to the Indian cities in search of work and livelihood options. We, as a community, need to ensure better and safe spaces for these internal migrants when we go back to normalcy.

This year’s ready reckoner rates were supposed to be announced on April 1. In an order issued on Monday, state IGR Omprakash Deshmukh said the rates would be announced later in accordance with the government’s further instrictions. He added that the existing ready reckoner rates would be applicable in the state till May 31 or the date when the government would issue the instructions.

Revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat told TOI last week that publication of this year’s ready reckoner (RR) rates had been postponed in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak in the state.

The ready reckoner rates, which are prices of a residential property, land or commercial property for a given area, are published on March 31 every year and implemented from April 1. All calculations related to real estate, such as stamp duty, registration, premiums and tax collection, are based on the ready reckoner rates.

Deshmukh, in his order issued under the Maharashtra Stamp (determination of true market value) Rules, 1995, said it was not possible for the government to publish the rates for 2020-21 in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

“The state government has instructed to continue with the 2019-20 rates till further orders. The government has directed the IGR to continue with the rates till May 31 or further instructions. Necessary orders have been issued to all field officers of the 516 registration offices across the state and they will act accordingly,” the IGR told TOI.

Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (Credai) representatives have urged the government to not increase the ready reckoner rates on the ground that the Covid-19 lockdown has slowed down the real estate sector that was already passing through a slowdown.

He has no history of international travel. The other two — a father-daughter duo — are residents of the Meenatai Thackeray slum in Gultekdi. Both had recently returned from a pilgrimage to Dubai.“The 76-year-old patient is undergoing treatment for breathlessness at a private hospital. The 65-year-old man and his 30-year-old daughter are showing minor ailments in the form of cough, sore throat and fever. They are undergoing treatment at Naidu hospital,” said Sanjeev Wavare, the assistant medical officer of health (AMoH), Pune Municipal Corporation.Nearly 30 close contacts of both sets of families have been quarantined at Naidu hospital. “Their throat swab samples have been sent to the National Institute of Virology. Containment measures are underway in both the slum pockets,” Wavare said.The 76-year-old was admitted to a private hospital with cardiac complaints and shortness of breath around 3am on March 28. “His throat swab sample returned as positive from the NIV,” an official from the private hospital said.This official added that the senior citizen had visited another hospital near his home on two occassion: on March 25 and again on March 28.Senior public health expert Subhash Salunkhe, an advisor to the state government on infectious diseases, said stringent cluster containment measures should be set in place through a three- kilometre restriction zone around both slums.“The two cases with travel history to Dubai are reassuring because they picked up the infection outside India. But the case of the 76-year-old, with no travel history, is a matter of concern. Strict cluste r containment measures should be implemented to contain the new virus as it can spread like wildfire within densely populated slums,” Salunke said.Similar containment measures are being suggested by leading expert from across the country. “A spread among the slum population of India will take us very close to the worst-case scenario,” said a doctor from New Delhi who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “In slum areas of many cities, we are still not seeing the level of caution urban households have taken to contain Covid-19.

PUNE: Barring some, medical stores across the city have ensured smooth supply of medicines to citizens.

The Chemists’ Association of Pune District has said medicines will be available throughout the lockdown period. The association said the demand is low due to the lockdown hence some medical shops remain open only for few hours.

In Baner and NIBM Road areas, some shops were shut. A security guard at the Baner-based medical shop said the shop did not have stocks and would re-open in three days when they are replenished .

Another chemist in Baner area said they too were out of stocks and did not know about the new stocks.

A representative at Parmar Medicals on Salunke Vihar Road said stocks were available for now. However, some medicines were unavailable and the customers were being told to come back the next day.

He said, “Tablets related to cold, flu, digestive pills were in high demand as according to the representative with the weather changing each day (hot in the day and raining in the afternoon), no one was taking any risks to develop cold and flu.”

Roshni Ajmera from NIBM area said, “Medical shops are closed since this morning. We are depending on the hospital’s pharmacy shops as the local people are complaining about shortage of medicines.”

At Wanowrie circle, Sinhagad Road, Bhusari Colony, Kothrud, Kalyaninagar, Vimannagar and Shivajinagar, a majority of the shops remained open throughout the day.

When contacted, Anil Belkar, secretary of the Chemists’ Association of Pune district, said there were some transport issues initially and the wholesalers could not provide the stock but now it has been sorted.

“There will not be any shortage of medicines and they will be provided abundantly. There is less demand due to the lockdown, clinics are closed and no people are on the roads which has led to decrease in demand. Hence, some pharmacies shut down early after staying open for few hours.”

SURAT: The Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has mounted a Herculean effort to disinfect the entire Rander area after a 67-year-old man tested positive for COVID-19, the second case from the same area.

The patient has no travel history and SMC fears that he may have come in contact with many people in and around Rander. The civic body has shifted 30 people who were in touch with him to government quarantine facility.

Municipal Commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani said that this would be biggest quarantine activity till date as the case of if local transmission. Rander has a population of nearly two lakh. ""Since we do not know how this person got infected, we need to isolate maximum number of people. Moreover, we have decided to carry out disinfectant activity in entire Rander area,'' Pani said.

SMC officials suspect that the before testing positive for COVID-19 may have attended religious or social gatherings and there may be many more carries of this deadly virus. ""This 67-year-old male owns a laundry shop in Rander. He has been residing within the 500 m radius of the locality from where the 32-year-old had tested positive on March 21. More worryingly, this laundry man was personally visiting his customers for delivering clothes,'' said an SMC official.

Deputy municipal commissioner (health and hospital), Dr Ashish Naik said, “The second case from same area indicates the spread of local transmission. About four close contacts from his family have been shifted to the government quarantine facility.” According to Dr Naik, the male had visited a private clinic in Rander for treatment of fever and cold. However, the health teams are camping in the Rander town to find out other people including doctors with whom the COVID-19 positive patients had established contact in the last 15 days.

PUNE: The Swargate police on Monday closed the roads leading to Meenatai Thackeray and Dias Plot slums in Gultekdi after a 65-year-old man and his daughter (30) from the area tested positive for the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) on Sunday.

Senior inspector Bramhanand Naikawdi of the Swargate police said, “The father-daughter duo had returned from Dubai on March 9. After they tested positive for Covid-19, they were shifted to Naidu hospital. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) health officials will conduct medical check-up of people in the slums with whom they came in close contact to prevent the spread of coronavirus.”

He said, “The slums were fumigated as a preventive measure. We have barricaded the slums and closed the roads between Giridhar Bhavan and City International School near Panchami hotel to dissuade the slum dwellers from coming out to roads. All Market Yard-bound goods vehicles will have to ply on alternative routes via Jedhe Chowk, Seven Loves Chowk, Golibar Maidan Chowk or Lullanagar Chowk.”

The city police have also barricaded all entry and exit points within 2km radius of Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Gultekdi Market Yard for decongesting the wholesale market premises.

Deputy commissioner of police (zone V) Suhas Bawache said, “We have taken a slew of measures for streamlining the movement of vehicles in and around the Gultekdi market yard to maintain the social distancing norm. On an average, around 500 farmers unload produce in the wholesale market, while about 1,500 traders load the goods in their vehicles for taking them to retail markets. We have allowed vehicles to enter through gate number 4 from Bibvewadi Road and exit through gate number 1 outside the Market Yard police station.”

The police and officials from various government departments like the Agriculture Market Produce Committee have prepared a plan” for streamlining the functioning of the market.

Bawache said, “On an average, between 25,000 and 30,000 people visit the city’s main market yard every day. We have barricaded all entry and exit points, including gates of housing societies, and installed a three-tier barricading system. We have issued passes to farmers, agents, businessmen and workers involved in goods loading and unloading.”

He said, “We have given a time slot for entry and exit to all vehicles and allowing entry to only 500 big vehicles at a time. One-hour time has been given to them to complete loading and unloading. Smaller vehicles like tempos will get 15 minutes each for the purpose. Vehicles waiting at designated spots will be released in phases.”

Bawache said, “Farmers can now supply their produce alternatively — for instance, vegetables on Sundays, and onion, potatoes and fruits on Mondays. The grocery market will remain open throughout the week because the sale of vegetables and fruits by small-time vendors outside the market has been stopped.”

He said, “Markets in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Kolhapur and Nagpur have been closed down and shifted to open places because of overcrowding. We have been fairly successful in decongesting the Gultekdi Market Yard through these measures,” he said.

Nagpur: City and district police are zealously promoting social distancing , and also adopting innovative measures to enforce, without the lathi, the national lockdown to break coronavirus chain. Cops are also now monitoring the bandobast through drone camera systems to keep a vigil on lanes and internal roads.

Commissioner of police BK Upadhyay has extended the validity of police passes issued to citizens to provide essential services from March 31 to April 14.

Koradi police on Monday, under Senior PI Vazeer Shaikh, took action against 40 violators in an innovative way as state government has asked cops to adopt ‘humane approach’. Maintaining the norms of social distancing, Shaikh set up a makeshift detention camp at his police station, and also at Mahadula, where he drew circles at safe distances to make detainees sit in separately. “They had to sit in the sun until we completed the formalities,” he said.

In another example, Zonal DCP Vinita Sahu and Sadar police intercepted three youngsters on a bike riding without helmet at Japanese Garden Square. Apart from penalizing them for violations of Motor Vehicle Act, the three were also made to stand apart following social distancing norms, and their video was made admitting to having breached traffic rules and also section 144 .

City police, under supervision of CP Upadhyay, have pulled up 1,877 violators, including 126 who were detained, for breaching section 144. Around 1,734 traffic violators were also penalized.

Following warning from the top brass, city police have also detained 80 vehicles, including 72 bikes, for violating the ‘stay at home’ policy of the lockdown.

In the four districts, IG Nagpur range KMM Prasanna enforced social distancing norms stringently at three levels apart from preventing breach of section 144. “The personnel have been made aware of the importance of social distancing through educative video,” he said.

“We have ensured social distancing norms are followed at police stations, while checking at nakabandis and also while dealing with the masses. Cops have been told to maintain utmost hygiene and follow safety measures like frequent use of sanitizers, and also wear mask and change it every day,” he said.

“The cops on the roads are also told to avoid communication from close quarters,” said the IG. He said even the ‘lathis’ or sticks are sanitized frequently while they are being used.

On a large scale, Prasanna cited the example of Wardha police, who have shifting a popular market to a ground to maintain social distancing norms. “We have ensured people can still go to a place to buy vegetables but due to the available space they would be spread out,” he said.

Prasanna also informed that police in the districts of Wardha, Bhandara, Chandrapur and Nagpur Rural are following the three basic policies to keep people off the roads. “We are just stopping, convincing and sending people back from nakabandis, and when necessary taking legal actions,” he said.

Citing the example from Chandrapur, Prasanna said two trucks carrying around 50 people from Telangana to Madhya Pradesh were intercepted. “We immediately seized the two trucks and shifted the migrant labourers to safe shelters,” he said. The IG also said that basic needs of the people are also being taken care of.

IG Prasanna also said maximum use is being made of public address system to announce social distancing and also norms for section 144.

“The government has issued guidelines about mass sanitation, which are being violated in the city. Such misuse of taxpayers’ money should be stopped,” Vivek Velankar, the founder of the Sajag Nagrik Manch, said.

The group has written to the civic administration regarding the same.

“The mass spraying may lead to a false impression about safety among residents of those areas. It will cause more harm than good. Spraying of disinfectants should be done judiciously,” Velankar said.

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials claimed that corporators from all political parties were demanding that the spraying be carried out in their respective wards. The civic officials stressed most of these areas did not need it as no positive case was reported there.

“We are getting consistent demands from elected members to spray disinfectants in their areas. It is exerting pressure on the limited manpower and resources that PMC has. We find it tough to fulfil the demands of all corporators,” a senior PMC official said, adding that the civic body was using sodium hypochlorite to spray areas that have reported positive cases.

Another PMC official said only 200 people were deployed for sanitizing areas. The civic body has completed fogging areas such as Bavdhan, Kothrud, Peth areas, some parts of Ahmednagar Road, Satara Road and Sinhagad Road.

“Directives have been given to the departments concerned. They have to spray disinfectants only in those areas where positive patients are found,” said PMC commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad .

AHMEDABAD: After a scrap dealer from a Gomtipur chawl died on Sunday because of Covid-19, a major challenge stares at health authorities in Ahmedabad now: Managing the disease in the crowded slums and chawls of the city.

“It is here that Covid-19 may reach disastrous proportions if we don’t get the community’s help and maintain strict vigil,” explains a senior municipal official. Right now some 45 families of Gajanand ni Chali are under home quarantine, a concept foreign to the people here. Some 300 homes around the scrapdealer’s home will be under scrutiny.

Municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra claimed that since Sunday morning the focus of disinfection operations, which is spraying sodium hypochlorite solution within homes and passages has been on in dense habitations.

“All of the 48 wards have begun disinfection operations,” says Nehra.

Gomtipur councillor Iqbal Shaikh is equally worried. “There are 14 major slums in Gomtipur and tremendous preparations and awareness drives will be required. Slums are a different ballgame to bungalows and apartments.”

A Patel society and a Jain Derasar society are the two middle-class localities around the Covid-19 epicentre here, said officials of the civic body.

A senior AMC official in the estate department told TOI that some major chawls under the lens are Balabhai Jagan Chali, Phoolwadi, Tek Bahadur Society, Ganji Farak Mill EWS Housing Cluster, Badia Kaka ni Chali, Chand Sahib Baba ki Dargah, dwellings along Usha Talkies Road and Swaminarayan School and Noorbhai Dhobi ni Chali.

“People here are mostly daily wagers and are now scared. They are also being told that FIRs will be registered against them if they violate quarantine norms. I feel, though it is late, some awareness activities is a must. Providing packets and ration kits on time will only help in building confidence,” says Shaikh.

PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation ( PMC ) officials feel that the 1% reduction in stamp duty for property registration offered by the state government will boost the real estate market with buyers coming forward to avail of the benefit.

The stamp duty concession will be offered for all sale and transfer of properties in PMC and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) areas. The discount announced in the state budget will be given for the next two years and come into force from April 1, 2020.

According to PMC officials, around 4,500 building permissions are given on an average in the municipal limits every year. “This is a welcome step for the construction industry in the city. Currently, there is a lull in the property market. The concession will help change things for the better. It will encourage people to buy properties,” city engineer Prashant Waghmare told TOI.

According to the PMC data, the revenue generated from building permissions in the last fiscal was Rs650 crore. This year, the PMC has collected Rs750crore from permission, premium fees and development charges.

228,['31/03/2020'],AI to operate 9 charters to fly back Germans,"NEW DELHI: Germany has mounted a massive exercise to fly out its citizens from India.

Air India will from Tuesday operate nine charter flights from cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai to Frankfurt on its wide-body aircraft to fly Germans back home over next few days. These aircraft will fly back from Germany to India as ferry flights (with no passengers). Last week, Lufthansa had operated two special flights from Delhi — double-decker 500-seater Airbus A380s — to fly Germans back home.

Four flights from Mumbai and one from Delhi will depart on Tuesday. Prior to these international charter flights, Air India will be flying the stranded foreigners from cities like Goa, Trivandrum, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kolkata to hub Mumbai and Delhi.

Air India has operated a large number of special flights to fly back Indians stranded in corona hotspots like China, Japan and Europe. Thousands have flown back home on these flights.

There is huge demand for similar charters by AI from other countries too, like the US, UK and Canada, to fly back their citizens from India. ""The situation is very fluid. Discussions are on but as of now no decision has been taken,"" sources said.

German ambassador to India Walter J Lindner tweeted on Monday: ""After flying 1,000 stranded travellers from Delhi to Frankfurt last week, we are working closely with Indian authorities (especially the ministry of external affairs) to bring home many more. Challenges amidst lockdown not small, but we’re working on it 24/7… We continue to do everything humanly possible to bring the stranded travellers still remaining in India back to Germany.""

The US embassy tweeted on Sunday: ""We anticipate several flights departing from New Delhi and Mumbai returning to the United States this week… it is likely (these) flights will have stricter than usual limits on the weight of luggage as well as be unable to accommodate pets."" US citizens stranded in India would need to fill out a form put up online by the US embassy and enrol in their ""Smart Traveler Enrolment Program""’ for critical information about flight opportunities.

Other countries are also keen to operate special flights to fly back their citizens from India. Canada, for instance, wanted to fly out its citizens from India. But for now AI can operate only quick turnaround flights on which the entire operating crew returns on the flight back. Sources said Canada was informed that the possibility of flying its citizens from India to somewhere in Europe, from where it could make arrangements to fly them home, could be discussed. AI has operated special flights to China, Europe and Israel by taking two sets of crew so that one set operates on the way out and the other while flying back home.

At this point, when schedule commercial flights to India are suspended till April 15, AI wants to have its crew back on the same flight to avoid stranding them in foreign lands. ""We have to be fully ready with our fleeting personnel to operate special flights to fly out foreigners or fly back Indians from across the world whenever the government asks us to do so. So no chance is being taken,"" said a source.

PUNE: Additional sessions judge V K Yavalkar on Monday rejected the bail application of Sandesh Wadekar (33), one of the five accused arrested in the case of an alleged Rs50 crore extortion bid on a city-based jeweller, earlier this month.

The city police’s anti-extortion cell arrested the five persons between March 10 and 21 on the charges of extortion and criminal intimidation by using a firearm, after threatening the jeweller that they would make a video clip of his family member viral on social media.

Four of the accused including Wadekar are lodged in the Yerawada jail, while the fifth — former NCP functionary Mangaldas Bandal — is in police custody remand till April 1. On March 26, additional sessions judge AV Rotte had rejected co-accused Rupesh Chaudhari ’s bail plea . The police had recovered a pen camera device, video clip and memory card from Wadekar’s house. Wadekar had worked as the jeweller’s driver.

Yavalkar in his order said, “It is seen from police papers that although role of the present applicant-accused (Wadekar) is not evident from FIR, there is recovery of pen camera used in the commission of the offence for preparing video, from the applicant accused. Therefore, the present applicant-accused appears to be prima facie involved in the commission of offence along with other co-accused.”

The judge said, “Considering the nature and gravity of the offence and stage of investigation, I am not inclined to released the accused on bail.”

Between Sunday evening and Monday morning, the police found 750 such people — either discreetly travelling by transport vehicles (like trucks and containers) or walking from Mumbai.

Senior police officers said that since the home-bound migrant workers would only be increasing the chances of the coronavirus spread, they have set up a checkpoint at Vilholi.

PUNE: The state agriculture department has set up control rooms in each district to monitor the movement of vegetables during the ongoing national lockdown.

The control rooms will ensure that farmers are able to transport and sell their produce without any hassle and supply the commodities as per the demands of the bigger markets.

Over 35 control rooms have been established across the state and most of these units have already started functioning and are monitoring the supply of vegetables and their transport, the department said.

The control rooms’ staff have been told to work in coordination with the respective district administration and Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMC). The farmers are told to get in touch with control rooms in case of disruptions, an official from the department said. The state government had already clarified that transport and sale of vegetables and fruits is allowed during the ongoing restrictions.

A senior official said farmers faced many problems in the initial days of lockdown while transporting their produce. The sudden cut-off also hampered the supply of commodities in bigger cities. The staff at the control rooms has now started collecting the details of farmers’ groups in their respective districts. These groups will get all the required assistance such as valid passes for transportation of goods, permits and NOCs in supplying commodities to district headquarters without any interruptions.

HYDERABAD: Telangana will soon have a comprehensive paddy and rice policy in view of increase in the staple’s yield in the state.

Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Monday held a review meeting at Pragati Bhavan on paddy cultivation, yield, rice, exports and related issues and directed officials to formulate the policy after consulting rice millers and other stake-holders.

“There are 2,200 rice mills across the state and each unit can mill one crore tonnes of rice per year. In the past, these mills could not get paddy to their capacity. Even to mill 20 to 30 lakh tonnes used to be a difficult task. Now, the situation has changed, paddy supply is in abundance,” the CM said during the meeting. While assuring all help to millers, he said there was a need to have more mills in the state.

On the rise in paddy production in the state, he said: “The situation that prevailed in the united AP and now is completely different. Kaleswaram, completion of the on-going projects, revival of tanks under Mission Kakatiya and 24-hour free power, farmers are getting water in abundance, which is resulting in paddy cultivation in the state. Paddy is being cultivated in 40 lakh acres in this rabi season. There is a possibility of getting over a crore tonnes of paddy.”

“In the kharif season, paddy cultivation is likely to touch 55 to 60 lakh acres. Under the Kaleswaram project alone, paddy can be cultivated in over 35 lakh acres. Paddy will be cultivated in at least 70 lakh acres next year. Telangana is becoming the rice bowl of India. Under these circumstances, procuring paddy, sending it to mills and selling the rice will become a tough task. For this, there is a need to implement a comprehensive paddy and rice policy,” KCR said.

The CM also assured millers that there will not be any harassment from officials. Rice millers must have a proper marketing strategy, he added.

240,['31/03/2020'],Migrants’ march halts long before home is in sight,"PUNE/NASHIK/NAGPUR: A sea of migrants stuck without food and money has little hope of making it home as state governments close borders.

Thousands trudging back to small villages from UP to Tamil Nadu have almost lost hope.

Bhura Jatav and five of his friends, all 19- and 20-year-olds, have walked and hitch hiked on their 1,600km journey from Visakhapatnam to Karauli in Rajasthan, reaching Nagpur on Monday in three days.

“On the Maharashtra-Telangana border, the police allowed our truck to go but we were offloaded. We reached Chandrapur in another vehicle,” he said.

At the Khawasa checkpoint on the Nagpur-Jabalpur highway, nearly 1,000 people were refused entry by Madhya Pradesh.

In Chandrapur, guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar defended his decision to turn away at least 9,000 people stranded on the Andhra Pradesh and Telangana borders.

“We don’t have a single case of coronavirus. We don’t want to risk the population. My stand is harsh but I need to do it,” Wadettiwar told TOI.

Across the MP border, farmers from Amravati who went to sell oranges pleaded on social media to be rescued as they were starving.

In Pune, those placed in shelter camps by the state government are walking out. In Shirur, 25 masons from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan had nothing to eat on Monday.

“We are struck with no work and no money. The administration gave us food for two days.” Ramlal Singh from Madhya Pradesh told TOI.

Premshankar Singh from Uttar Pradesh and 50 other migrant workers moved out of Pune but were stopped by the police. “We have little money and no rations and there are families to feed,” he said.

Another group from Nagapattinam was camping in Daund taluka while another 45 people from Cuddalore were in Baramati.

At the shelters, social distancing has fallen by the wayside and cramped accommodation has sent them out of the camps. “With lakhs of such migrants told to stay back, it is very difficult to monitor them and ensure supply of rations,” a district adminstration official told TOI.

Pune divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar said they had provided 214 shelter homes for over 64,926 people. He has assured ration and food for them.

“Each of the six divisional commissioners was making arrangements. More than a lakh are expected. Nearly 50,000 labourers have been given food in Pune, Navi Mumbai, Mumbai, Nagpur and Thane,” said the official. They are from West Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.

Despite assurances, many migrants are desperate to go home. A night patrol in Pune stopped 45 people, including 14 children, on their way to Karnataka in a tractor trolley on Sunday. In Nashik, more than 750 people, travelling towards Nashik from Mumbai, were stopped near Vilholi between Sunday and Monday.

Rural areas can turn unmanageable if the government does not act now, said former Shirur MP Shivaji Adhalrao Patil. As many as 30,000 to 50,000 people in Junnar, who came back, are not following the 14-day quarantine, he said. The stamping has discontinued and the monitoring mechanism has buckled, he added.

Another 15,000 have returned from Pune and Mumbai to the talukas in Pune. “They should be in home quarantine, but there is no monitoring and people are moving out freely,” Patil said.

Cops said people repeatedly breach norms of the nationwide lockdown imposed under section 144 in the backdrop of coronavirus scare.

Even state home minister Anil Deshmukh ’s demand before Prime minister Narendra Modi to extend Rs50 lakh insurance cover to police could not bring cheers to the cops at the ground level. Devoid of any prescribed protective gear like N95 masks, cops are checking citizens on the road for around 12 hours, which is another one of their grievances.

A constable, on the condition of anonymity, said the public has already received the message that police will only convince them due to which they not afraid to break norms. “People are misleading cops at checkpoints with various excuses and pointing at the exempted essential services to come on the roads for trivial reasons,” he said.

“We can easliy catch their lies but cannot pull them up heavily. It is taking a toll on our mental health dealing with public for 12 hours as most of them are in no mood to cooperate,” he said, adding that the government has also exposed them to the threat of infection by not providing them proper masks and gloves.

“People are also misusing the passes for moving around and stepping out multiple times instead of sticking to just fetching essential goods,” said another cop. “Some of the pass holders are sharing it with others making it difficult to decongest the road. We have stopped and seized the passes and also told our seniors about the misuse,” he said.

A head constable, posted in north Nagpur, said some of the citizens are using old medical records and papers to step out of homes. “Two persons are stepping out at the same time to purchase grocery or medicines for the same family. We are requesting them to divide the work but still people are moving around on bikes and cars,” said the cop.

Another senior cop said, “Some people are threatening to lodge complaint against us with senior authorities even when we merely point our sticks to them to say or gesture something. People are making baseless allegations against us. We are facing mental harassment from the public,” he said.

He was under self-medication for four days and went to district hospital on Friday only after learning a day earlier that his colleagues at work in Noida tested positive.

Confirming this on Monday, district epidemiologist Dr Meesam Abbas said, “The man who tested positive for Covid-19 was under self-medication from March 23 to 26. He went on his own to district hospital on March 27 where he was admitted and sample was collected. We have placed the medical store owner and his son under quarantine and their samples have been sent for testing. We are trying to trace if any other individual at the medical store or anywhere else came in contact with the man. Besides, the man was in contact with two of his relatives.”

After testing positive on Sunday, the health department has shifted six members of his family who were all staying with him to a quarantine facility. Notably, the man is working at a Noida-based company and some of his colleagues have tested positive as well. He returned to Bareilly on March 22.

Meanwhile, the health department has asked two private hospitals, situated within one km radius of the man’s house, to provide a daily list of those suffering from acute respiratory illness. “If no individual with this symptom turns up here, the hospitals will again have to notify us. We will collect sample of the people with acute respiratory illness at these two hospitals and test them for Covid-19,” Abbas added, as part of precautionary measure to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in the city.

For conducting active case surveillance, the department has divided the area among nine teams on Monday. The teams will conduct surveillance for the next 14 days. “The teams will visit every house situated within a kilometre radius of the man’s house.

Reason: “concerns” raised by frustrated customers claiming to have withdrawal symptoms G Honnagiri Gowda, president of Karnataka State Wine Merchants Association, said the shutdown has resulted in social issues like illegal sale of liquor and burglary at retail liquor outlets in Hubballi, Davangere and Chitradurga.However, doctors and psychiatrists say the government should use the lockdown as an opportunity to treat addicts, instead of succumbing to the liquor lobby. In a letter to the state government, Dr BN Gangadhar, director of National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences ( Nimhans ), has warned about a possible upsurge in cases of withdrawal symptoms and urged the government to take precautionary measures and arrange for adequate de-addiction treatment.The wine merchants association’s demand comes in the wake of a similar crisis in neighbouring Kerala, where nine alcoholics allegedly committed suicide. On Monday chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan directed the Kerala excise department to provide liquor to those with a prescription from a doctor.The association claims as per police records, seven people in the state committed suicide due to lack of alcohol.“We urge the government to rope in e-commerce firms and supply liquor online on the lines of Kerala,” said KS Lokesh, MD of Madhuloka, a chain of liquor outlets.The association wants the government to allow liquor sale for limited hours (between 10am and noon).",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74905692,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-287023,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/lack-of-liquor-rise-in-cases-of-withdrawal-symptoms-likely-says-nimhans-chief/articleshow/74902177.cms

249,['31/03/2020'],AAI told not to invoke food retailer’s bank guarantee,"Representative image

PUNE: A district court has restrained the Airports Authority of India (AAI) from invoking a Rs4.2-crore bank guarantee furnished by Lite Bite Food Private Limited, a Gurugram-based food and beverage retail company, till the completion of an ongoing arbitration proceeding over the latter’s move to shut down two of its restaurants in April last year at the Lohegaon airport.

In a recent order, district judge SS Gosavi also restrained the IndusInd Bank Limited in New Delhi from releasing the amounts under bank guarantee in favour of the AAI till the disposal of the arbitration proceeding.

Judge Gosavi ruled, “In the light of the factual and legal position, I hold that the applicant (Lite Bite) has made out a prima facie case. The said bank guarantee will expire on February 7, 2022. The time limit for completion of arbitration proceeding is 12+6 total 18 months. Before expiry of bank guarantee, the arbitration proceeding is going to be completed. Under such circumstances, if injunction as prayed will be granted in favour of application, no prejudice will be caused to the respondents (AAI & IndusInd Bank).”

“On the contrary, if injunction as prayed will not be granted, the applicant would suffer huge irreparable loss. Its security deposit in the form of bank guarantee will be forfeited as well as it will be restrained from taking part in bidding process of AAI in future,” the judge held.

Lawyer Ravi Bharadwaj, representing Lite Bite, told TOI, “On July 9, 2018, our client entered into a 7-year concession agreement with the AAI, with a three-and-a-half-year lock-in period, for operating the restaurants near the Security Hold Area (SHA)-1. Apart from furnishing bank guarantee, it gave Rs2.10 crore security deposit and invested Rs10 crore in the restaurants. However, in October/November 2018, the AAI unilaterally and in breach of the agreement, closed the SHA-1 and shifted the screening area to SHA-2 to the other end of the building, adversely impacting our client’s business and causing losses.”

After an initial exchange of correspondence, Lite Bite intimated to the AAI on April 3, 2019, its intention to terminate the contract and on April 17, 2019, sent a mail to the AAI informing that the earlier intimation be treated as a 180-day notice of termination of contract. In turn, the AAI called upon Lite Bite on April 22, 2019 to furnish Rs12.81 crore licence fees and warned of encashing the bank guarantee.

250,['31/03/2020'],Farmer shares his produce with out-of-job workers,"Nashik: A farmer in the Kasbe-Sukene village of Niphad taluka has saved quite a few families from going hungry for days by distributing a part of his agricultural produce for free.

With the lockdown firmly in place, daily staples are being sold at a premium — often putting a strain on the budget of the workers.

To add to their woes, many farms and establishments, where these workers are employed, have been shut. Being out of work with no other means of livelihood, many workers are unable to even feed their families.

At such a time, wheat cultivator Datta Ramrao Patil , who has a 3-acre farm in Niphad, gave away a large portion of his wheat stock for free to the workers. Patil’s elder brother, who works for a company, also helped him.

On Friday, when he was working in the field, a woman, along with her daughter, had approached Patil seeking leftover food. She also requested him to save some leftovers each day so that she could collect it for her family. The woman told Patil that since the ration shops were closed, there was no food available in the market. Moreover, she did not have any food at home either.

“The families of the workers living across the street are not beggars. They are all self-respecting people. I thought of giving away 1,000 kg of wheat that I had cultivated in one acre of my farm. I consulted with my elder brother, and he agreed with me,” said Patil.

The grains had been cleaned for sale in the market. “I had not even packed the grains. The amount of wheat we gave to the workers was one-third of our total production,” said Patil.

He requested people to take only what they need.

“We wanted to ensure social distancing. Hence, we carved out boxes to ensure people maintained a safe distance from each other while collecting the grains. Everyone cooperated,” he said.

The video of Patil distributing wheat among the workers was captured by his daughter.

The video went viral on social media, drawing attention from across the globe and applause from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray ’s office.

The civic body is presenting the budget with surplus revenue for the fourth consecutive year.

While the total revenue is estimated to be Rs 2156.18 crore, the expenditure is expected to be Rs 2155.03 crore. The corporation is estimated to have the surplus revenue of Rs 1.14 crore, this year.

256,['31/03/2020'],Checkpoints along Kasara Ghat moved to curb movement,"Nashik: District administration has changed the position of the checkpoints along Kasara Ghat to prevent entry of vehicles into Nashik.

“Our regular check post was near Ghatan Devi mandir just after the vehicles climb up the ghats. But now the same has been put shifted right in the middle of the ghat where district border starts,” Tejas Chavhan, sub divisional officer, Igatpuri-Trimbakeshwar, said.

The move was to discourage the people from climbing the ghat and then gaining entry in Nashik district . The officer said the Kasara Ghat acts as a psychological barrier for the people coming from Mumbai side.

Bhiwandi ( Thane district ) and Taloja (Raigad district) is home to the large numbers of labourers working in the logistics and the industrial development corporation areas. A very large number of these people are now trying to go home.

“For all these people, the Kasara Ghat is a psychological barrier. Once they come up the ghat, they are confident of moving to their homes. They hardly turn around thereafter,” Chavhan said.

Officials said that when the drivers come up the ghat, they tend to argue and even loiter about creating huge traffic problems. This affects the release of genuine people through the check post.

According to another senior officer from the administration, the team of officials from Nashik had visited Shahapur and other areas asking for check posts to be put up so that people don’tmove towards Nashik.

“Whether that has been put in place or not is not known as the crowd has still not thinned. The shifting of the post in the ghat has helped in many ways. Since there is only space enough for small vehicle to turn around, the vehicles are in queue. So they cannot loiter around and cannot argue as well,” the officer added.

This has thus led to decrease in the traffic coming towards Nashik.

PUNE: The Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DICCI) and College of Engineering, Pune (CoEP), will start a community kitchen for over 600 homeless people being quarantined in five shelter homes in the city.

The kitchen will start on the CoEP campus.

DICCI, along with Pune Hoteliers Association, is already running a kitchen at three hotels in the city since March 27, providing meals to over 1,000 daily wage workers, including some in Lonavla on the request of the railway police.

“The district administration approved our proposal to set up the kitchen, which will provide two hot meals to the homeless people in quarantine, so we got in touch with CoEP, which agreed to let us use its premises. Other than this, we are also providing a 5kg kit, consisting of wheat flour, rice, dal, masala, oil and salt to about 50 daily wage labourers, who are finding it tough to even eat one square meal a day. This will help them out for about 5-7 days,” Milind Kamble, DICCI’s founder-chairman, said.

CoEP director B B Ahuja said the college’s mess and kitchen were unused as none of the students reside on campus, “All we have done is provide this area. The large mess and kitchen area were fumigated and sanitized today. The area will be used to cook and pack food so that it can be taken to different places. CoEP, being centrally located, will help them cater to people in need across the city,” said Ahuja.

Akshath Shetty, who owns Bamboo house NX on Prabhat Road, said they provided the food to 300 people on Saturday, while Deepak Shetty who runs Sitar restaurant said, that they would be providing dinner for 350 people. “Currently all this is done out of our pocket. My cousin, Yashraj, too provided food from his hotel, but we need more people to join or sponsor this activity,” said Shetty.

Raju Waghmare, also from DICCI, said, “The food will be given at midday and then at 7.30pm at shelter homes. The first two days we will be able to provide food for about 600 people, and once this number increases, we would be able to provide food to about 1,200 people.”

261,['31/03/2020'],"Goa government blockade of medicines leaves elders, ailing in lurch","Representative image

PANAJI: The state government’s consistent floundering and mismanagement has left thousands of citizens who are sick and with pre-existing conditions without their medication. Senior citizens, especially, have been left in the lurch, as most pharmacies in Goa have run out of stock and wholesalers are unable to operate.

The empty shelves and closed shutters at the state’s pharmacies are due to the fact that trucks carrying medicines have been stuck at the state border, with the Goa government refusing to let them in. The state’s blockage of essential healthcare products is at odds with Centre stating explicitly that pharmaceuticals and medical equipment are exempted from the lockdown. Only on Monday, more than a week after the lockdown began, did supplies start trickling in.

Within the state too, the glacial pace at which the Goa government is issuing travel passes meant that pharmacy and distributor staff can’t get to work, leaving citizens to bear the brunt, and in some cases, put their lives at risk.

Even as the state government boasts of its efforts to combat coronavirus, face masks, hand sanitizers and even vitamic C tablets are out of stock in most pharmacies.

Late on Monday, the district magistrate, North Goa, permitted all pharmacies and pharma firms to operate. Chief minister Pramod Sawant too, on Monday, said that he has directed distributors to continue the supply of medicines to pharmacies to avoid shortage of life-saving drugs.

The impact of the easily-avoidable shortage has hit senior citizens especially hard. Kantilal Mokani’s son travelled over 30 km trying to source hypertension and cardiac medicines for his parents on Sunday. With some pharmacies in Panaji shut, others were out of Apresol (for hypertension).

“I then went to the hospital in Dona Paula which prescribed the medication in the first place. Even the hospital didn’t have the medication. I then had to go to a private pharmacy at GMC, where I picked up what they said was the last stock,” he said.

Arpita Naik, 62 who lives alone, had to do without her regular dose of hypertension tablets for two days, as the pharmacy in Candolim she normally picks them up from didn’t have it. “If not for my friend in another village, I had to go without taking medicines, I don’t know for how many days (this can go on),” she said. Many residents have no option but to travel long distances in search of pharmacies, risking being arrested for defying the curfew.

Sources say that the shortage of medicines could also partly be attributed to people buying in bulk, as the lockdown, abruptly imposed, threw people into a state of panic. This situation, they said, could easily have been avoided if the government had made arrangements to keep the supply chain intact.

“These arrangements ought to have been worked out prior to the lockdown to ensure that the supply chain was not disrupted. But trucks carrying medicines are left stranded at the border,” said Kedar Jirage, proprietor and chief pharmacist at Jeevan Rekha pharmacy. Jirage said that while has been able to stock most medicines, his pharmacies do not have either hand sanitizers or face masks.

The state government’s constant flip-flops have forced some pharmacies to err on the side of caution. Many pharmacists told TOI that, fearing for their safety, they preferred to keep their shutters down, while others opened for only a few hours each day. “These two weeks are crucial, that’s why we have decided to keep the pharmacy open only for a few hours each day as a precautionary measure,” one pharmacist told TOI.

Although Goa has a robust pharma industry, most of the medicines manufactured here are exported. Around 70-80% of the state’s medicine supply comes from other states.

Albert De Sa, president of the Chemist and Druggist Association of Goa, said all pharmacies will become operational in a day or two as their staff have been issued travel passes. Some have already become operational.

“Pharmacists remained shut as their staff were unable to travel due to restrictions. It is difficult for the pharmacist alone to handle all customers. So is the case with wholesalers. Besides the district collector, the FDA director has also been asked to issue travel passes,” he said.

De Sa appealed to people not to stock, as that denies medicines to others. “I fervently ask people not to buy medicines in bulk,” he said.

With pharmacies remaining closed or going out of stock, some people tried alternatives. In Chicalim, when a patient found that Acitrom (blood thinner) 2 mg was out of stock, he bought a 1 mg strip instead, and has been managing the daily dose by taking two tablets instead of one.

263,['31/03/2020'],Symptoms after 18-26 days: New case in Lucknow puzzles doctors,"LUCKNOW: The curious case of 73-year-old woman, who was tested Covid-19 positive on Monday about 18-26 days after coming in contact with her daughter-in-law, has left medical experts puzzled.According to World Health Organisation (WHO) assessment, the incubation period of coronavirus is 5-14 days, which means symptoms of infection surface in a person within 14 days of coming in touch with a Covid-19 positive patient.The elderly woman is the mother-in-law of a 35-year-old Toronto-based doctor who visited Lucknow on March 8 and tested Covid-19 positive on March 10. The doctor underwent treatment at KGMU and was discharged on March 21 after recovery with the advice of 14 more days of isolation.After the doctor was found positive, her family members, including her mother-in-law were tested and their reports were found to be negative.The elderly woman, the wife of a retired colonel, was admitted to Command Hospital of Central Command in Lucknow on Saturday (March 28) after she complained of urinary tract infection.Since her daughter-in-law had been tested positive earlier, the swab samples of the woman were collected again and sent to NIV Pune for testing in which she was found Covid-19 positive.Lucknow CMO Dr Narendra Agarwal said according to Indian Council of Medical Research and government guidelines, close contact of Covid-19 patient should be tested once within 14 days.“Further, a person has to be tested only when he shows symptoms. In this case, we tested the elderly woman as per guidelines on March 13, two days after her daughter-in-law tested positive,” he said.Prof Amita Jain, head of microbiology department at KGMU said, “As per WHO assessment, the incubation period of novel coronavirus is 5-14 days. Due to this, contacts of Covid-19 patients are advised 14 days self-isolation. However, in this case, the NRI doctor was tested positive on March 10 and her mother-in-law was admitted on March 28, which means symptoms appeared after 18 days. If we count from the date of the doctor’s arrival, the time span is 26 days.”“These facts makes the 73-year-old woman a case study for us. We need to find answers to many questions. Can the incubation period be more than 14 days? Can symptoms take more than two weeks to surface? Can a patient continue to shed virus even after recovery? There can other possibilities too,” Prof Jain added.Virologist Prof TN Dhole, former head of microbiology department at SGPGI, said evidence-based research was required to understand the virus. “There is a possibility that the viral load was very low when the woman was first tested. Due to this, the incubation period could be longer than 14 days,” he added.Some experts said that now when the NRI doctor was being tested again, it would bring to the fore possibilities of recurrence, which so far have been found to be rare.",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74903988,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-43307,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/symptoms-after-18-26-days-new-case-puzzles-doctors/articleshow/74902639.cms

Associations of the Lasalgaon onion traders and head-load workers gave separate letters to the agriculture market produce committee ( APMC ) management on Monday expressing their inability to participate in the auction. The onion traders’ association wanted the auction to be stopped from Tuesday as they were unwilling to take part in it.

Considering their stance, the APMC has decided to close onion auction for next few days. “We are temporarily closing onion auction from Tuesday until further decision following demand from onion traders association and also the loaders due to Covid-19,” said Narendra Wadawane , secretary, Lasalgaon APMC. Though there is a countrywide lockdown since March 22, APMC was exempted as it is an essential service.

On Monday, auction of a record 38,000 quintals of onions took place as most farmers had already brought their produce to the market. A total 1,867 farmers brought their onions in sacks. Onion auction of 76,865 sacks was done on Monday.

Of total arrivals, 75% of the arrivals were of late kharif onions, while remaining were of summer onions.

“The late kharif onions have a shelf life of less than one month and hence farmers have not option, but to sell the produce at the prevailing market rates. Hence, farmers want to sell their produce at the earliest. This is the reason farmers rushed the mandi to sell their produce,” said APMC officials.

On the contrary, summer onions have a shelf life of more than six months. Hence, farmers prefer storing onions with a hope of getting better price.

On Monday too, summer onions fetched more rates as compared to late kharif onions.

While the average wholesale onion price of summer onion was Rs 1,650 per quintal, that of late kharif onions was recorded at Rs 1,200 per quintal.

PUNE: With theatres shut because of lockdown, stage actor and director Atul Pethe has taken to the digital medium to direct and stage a play based on the deadly virus that has upended lives around the world.

Marking the World Theatre Day on Friday, Pethe released a “three-minute, three-part digital play” on YouTube titled “Theatre in the time of CORONA”.

He said that even though the play has been filmed digitally, he had tried to keep the essence of theatre intact.

The overwhelming theme of the play is agony, across three short “acts”, peppered with an overwhelming sense of desire and clamour for things as basic as the sun outside the home. But it doesn’t end without providing a semblance of hope, of how human beings may reassess the world after the crisis, with a possible end to the greed of humans, and a return to the basics. The last act features Pethe, with his profile lit up dramatically, wiping off layers of dust and msud from his face.

“The mud depicts the layers of greed that human beings in general have put on themselves. We have long abandoned our need and only increased our greed. After this crisis, human beings will hopefully re-assess their basic needs,” Pethe said.

He added, “Everyone is disturbed. Theatres are shut, everyone is confined to their homes and this will have a huge social, economic, and political impact. There is fear and anxiety all around. Even I am wondering as to what is happening to me, with all the fragmentation and polarisation and all the social distancing around me. There was already distancing and discrimination in society based on caste and religion, and this crisis has reduced us to poor and lonely human beings.”

PANAJI: A new virology laboratory at Goa Medical College ( GMC ) and hospital, Bambolim, set up in less than a month, became operational on Monday. A trial test at the new lab, which can test samples for coronavirus, was conducted on Sunday.

Director of health services Dr Jose de Sa said that six samples of coronavirus suspects have been sent to the lab and results are awaited.

With the new lab becoming functional, the state is set to get test results faster. Until two days ago, swab samples were sent to virology laboratories outside the state, such as the National Institute of Virology, Pune.

“We received laboratory results within two to three days when sent for testing outside Goa, but we will now know the status of suspects much faster,” said a senior health official.

Goa has five confirmed cases of Covid-19, of which two were detected on Sunday. Efforts were underway to trace the immediate contacts or family members linked to two men. One of the two, a 37-year-old man, had a travel history.

“Some of his contacts have been traced and quarantined, but some of his co-passengers are yet to be tracked when he flew to Goa on March 22. The man came from New York to Mumbai, and then took a Vistara domestic flight to Goa.

The health department has appealed to passengers on that Vistara flight to immediately call 104 or 0832-2421810/2225538, or report to the nearest health centre.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant, speaking to reporters, said that 20 of the man’s co-passengers of the man had been traced. However, it could not be verified how many travellers the health department was yet to trace.

The condition of five Covid-19 patients who are being treated at the ESI Covid-19 hospital was improving, he said. Meanwhile, on Monday, nine passengers were home quarantined, 22 placed under facility quarantine, and six placed in GMC’s isolation facility.

The blanket ban on sale of liquor staring March 24 left tipplers in Dakshina Kannada with little time to replenish their cabinet, which has resulted in many reporting to mental health doctors with symptoms of withdrawal On the one hand, surging demand has created a black market for alcohol , with many customers paying as much as thrice the maximum retail price for a sip. Conrad Misquith, a tattoo artist and owner of a studio in Padil, said that people were willing to pay Rs 200 for a 90ml tetra packet of McDowell’s whiskey, the MRP of which was Rs 70. “The problem is that many tipplers are wary of venturing outside their homes. Many senior citizens who are in the habit of taking a sip before retiring for the day too are struggling to cope with the non-availability of liquor,” said Misquith.Psychiatrist and professor at Fr Muller Medical College Hospital Dr Supriya Hegde Aroor said that symptoms of withdrawal could either be severe or mild. “In the latter case, those suffering from alcohol withdrawal report lack of sleep or bitterness in their mouth, which lasts for around a week, after which they adapt themselves to the change, and live comfortably. In those who exhibit severe symptoms can experience seizures and even delirium. In such cases, the first 48 to 72 hours are crucial,” said Dr Supriya, who had to attend to an emergency case a few days ago when a patient tried to commit suicide owing to the non-availability of alcohol and had to be rushed to the hospital.Professor and head of the department of psychiatry at AJ Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre Dr Ravish Thunga admitted to a rise in patients who were reporting symptoms of alcohol withdrawal since the lockdown came into force. “Given that alcohol is not going to be available for a long period, such reactions are along expected lines in those with what is called alcohol dependence syndrome. These patients need medical help,” said doctors.Bernard D’Souza, a businessman in Dakshina Kannada district, urged the government to take note of the severity of the problem and introduce a quota system, along the lines of the one followed by the Indian Army.Deputy commissioner of excise in Dakshina Kannada district Shailaja Kote said that the excise department was closely monitoring the unauthorised sale of liquor.Fake news of liquor outlets in Karnataka being open from 2pm to 5.30pm which claim to have originated from police and the DC’s office has added to the confusion. “We have already registered a criminal case, and an investigation is under way.

COIMBATORE: A five-year-old boy from Siddhapudur in the city on Monday donated all his piggy bank savings (Rs 7,000) to the collector’s relief fund as a gesture of fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.

The boy – S Reno Joshua, had saved the amount from the gifts he had received in the past three years. He handed over the entire amount to district collector K Rajamani on Monday.

“A couple of days ago, Reno saw the visuals of how guest workers in the city were struggling during the lockdown. He shot a series of questions towards us after seeing visuals. When we explained about the difficulties that they had been undergoing, he said that he wanted to donate his piggy bank savings,” Reno’s father Suresh said.

“Even though we have been thinking of using the money to admit our three-and-a-half-year-old daughter in school this year, we did not want to set a bad example by stopping him from donating the money,” he said, adding that they have decided to postpone the admission of their daughter by a year.

“We can understand the difficulties of staying away from home especially when the country is locked down completely,” he added.

And so, Yogesh Dhimar called up his friends, relatives, and even foe, if need be, to donate their blood so that not a single patient in the city hospitals have to suffer from a shortage of blood during the lockdown.

""On Saturday, we called Surat Raktadan Kendra and Research Centre's mobile van near my residence for blood donation. I called up my friends who regularly donate blood to come and donate to save lives. Following all protocols for Covid-19, we collected 47 units of blood on Saturday,” said Dhimar, who earlier helped collect 93 units of blood.

Talking to TOI, he said that with the enforcement of the lockdown, it is important that regular blood donors ensure that that they donate so that the blood banks do not run out of its required stock of blood.

In fact, last week Dhimar received an emergency call from Surat Raktdan Kendra at 7am asking him if he could donate blood at the blood bank . Dhimar was there within 20 minutes and donated SDP. “While donating blood , I always pray that the patient who receives my blood should get well soon and should never ever require blood in the future,'' said the man who runs coaching classes, and has donated blood 190 times till now which includes 125 time SDP (single donor platelets).

His blood donation journey began in October 1989 and vows it will continue till it there is blood to be shared in his body. Dhimar is also an active member of blood donation awareness campaigns.

""There are more than 200 people, mostly my friends, whom I convinced to donate blood and have now become regular blood donors,'' he added.

A division bench of chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and justice BV Nagarathna gave this direction after holding a special sitting via video conferencing to consider various issues related to the outbreak of Covid-19 virus.

During the 160-minute hearing, many petitioners expressed concern over police beating up citizens while enforcing the lockdown. A report was also sought on an incident in Sanjaynagar where police claimed that two persons attacked policemen on duty.

The bench said citizens must also be co-operative with the administration.

When some petitioners expressed concern over the supply of safety equipment to BBMP pourakarmikas who collect waste from houses of quarantined persons, the court asked the government to respond.

On the issue of food security, the court said the state can direct gram panchayats to take care of food security of persons living within their jurisdiction.

The court noted that authorities must look into the aspect of community transmission of coronavirus if cooked food is supplied through Indira Canteens, there will be mass gathering of people.

On April 3, the next date of hearing, the state must inform as to how pregnant women, lactating mothers and malnourished children will be provided with meals in view of closure anganwadis. It must also submit a status report on providing protective equipment to doctors and private hospitals, the number of labs available to test coronavirus.

LUCKNOW: A few teachers of the Lucknow University have taken the online way to start ‘Our Pupils’ Day (OPD)’ a programme scheduled from March third week, but which could not be initiated because of the lockdown.

Under the programme, a teacher has to reserve an hour on a designated day every week to counsel students on academic and personal issues. Students can walk-in to the teacher’s chamber for one-to-one session. The twin objectives are to strengthen student-teacher bonding and help students to remain stress-free.

Without waiting for the lockdown to be over, teachers of some departments, including physics, journalism, law and mathematics have started OPDs through video calls. However, instead of one-to-one, most held group sessions. Individual counselling will be held later, they said.

Prof Anurag Srivastava of law department devoted Sunday for counselling. “Students are worried about their future due to academic closure and needed to be assured that teachers would do everything possible to prevent the session from being delayed, he said.

Prof Poonam Tandon of physics department, who ran a group online OPD on Saturday, said “Around 38 students turned up for the session. Since most had concerns about unavailability of books due to the lockdown, we decided to make e-content and e-books available to them.

And, it’s Tamiflu, an antiviral drug used to treat Influenza A H1N1, that has helped them recover from the infection which has wreaked havoc across the world.Besides Tamiflu, the patients were administered paracetamol and supportive drugs. In fact, two of the six cured patients were hardly given any medicine as they had no symptoms.While there were reports of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) drugs being used for treating Covid-19 patients in China, Government of India guidelines specified Tamiflu and other supportive drugs. The dosage of Tamiflu suggested was 75mg twice a day for five days.“There is no specific medicine for Covid-19 and we are giving symptomatic treatment only. For some of the patients, bronchodilators in the form of injections were used to clear the congestion in chest. In some cases, nebulisation was also used,” said a doctor who has treated more than five Covid-19 cases so far in a government hospital in Bengaluru.“Though Covid-19 is a virus affecting the respiratory system, because of prolonged hospital stay, there were chances of patients developing bacterial infections as well. Hence in some cases, along with other drugs, antibiotics were given,” he added.One patient was given Tamiflu, crocin and regular steam inhalation.

289,['31/03/2020'],"Betrayed, locals put up posters seeking their ‘missing’ MLAs","PANAJI: A widely-circulated message on social media called constituents of the Thivim constituency to “gather in large numbers” outside the police station to lodge a missing complaint. It was about their MLA, as everyone said he was nowhere to be seen in “times of need.”

There are posters doing the rounds about Mapusa MLA Joshua D’Souza and Vasco MLA Carlos Almeida. Both are identical and have missing written in bold, all over it. Their constituents had not seen either of them and egged on “whoever has seen them” to drop them back at their constituency’s popular points and take home rewards.

In these times of coronavirus and lockdown when there is shortage of food and essentials, people are looking at their elected representatives for help.

Not just MLAs , but also panchs, councillors and sarpanchs. When they are not seen, they have resorted to innovative ways like posters and messages on social media to get them out of their self-imposed quarantines.

Almost all politicians were active in their constituencies ahead of the zilla panchayat elections, which were first deferred by two days to March 24 and then eventually postponed indefinitely after a public furore against Pramod Sawant-led government for putting people’s lives at risk.

“During festival, ration was sent to respective homes. How beautifully you organised everything. Just inquiring, where are you now? Is all that only to secure the votes for you to get elected? Come on, get out now, go house to house to distribute ration, your constituents are not aware where to find food. Remember, if you don’t show your face now, do you think we will recognise you later?”, states one message that is doing the rounds.

Not every elected representative has gone into a shell. Some MLAs are proactive and have involved their close aides to supply essential commodities to the people. Calangute MLA Michael Lobo and Taleigao MLA Jennifer Monserrate distributed fresh vegetable even before the government started procuring vegetables through the horticulture corporation.

The Corporation of the City of Panaji, controlled by local MLA Atanasio Monserrate, started house to house delivery on the day state government declared lockdown.

In South, deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar and Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco have both been seen monitoring sale of vegetables and fish, respectively.

With everyone locked at home, social media has become the best outlet to vent out frustrations. Through social media, people have questioned their MLAs, most of whom are active on Twitter and issue statements at every given opportunity. All of them have been told, now is the time to make your presence felt on the ground and ensure essential supplies to the public.

If they don’t show up, more posters and missing complaints are likely to follow.

PANAJI: In the weeks to come, when the thousand-odd tourists stranded in Goa reach home, they will think not only about their ordeal in the wake of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, but also of the handful of unsung heroes in Goa who helped them in their plight.

While German, Russian and a few other foreign citizens received prompt response from their government, British tourists felt abandoned by the British Foreign Office. And as India’s lockdown unfolded, common people stepped in to fill the sudden void that they found themselves stuck in.

From faceless locals who provided food to foreigners out of compassion, to the helpline set up by the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG), and from small hoteliers offering free stays, to a store manager in UK , many people pitched in to provide succour.

When UK supermarket store manager Peter Mendes heard that two of his colleagues were stuck in India, he and one of the colleague created a WhatsApp group and invited other Britons stuck in India to join. As the numbers crossed 70, the former Chinchinim boy began to write to British MPs urging them to organise rescue flights.

“I managed to get some passengers back home thanks to help from the German embassy in New Delhi,” Mendes said. A student of Loyola High School, Margao, Mendes contacted some of his classmates to seek help for British nationals stuck in South Goa.

Up north, the TTAG set up a helpline for foreigners and began frantically calling embassies to explore the possibility of rescue flights. “Many homestays and smaller hotels wanted to get rid of the guests, telling them to vacate. We tried to get all the tourists in one place and one of our members came forward to take them in. We also compiled the list and passport details of all those here in Goa to give to the embassies,” hotelier and former president of TTAG Savio Messias said.

Even as the UK government kept asking its citizens to be patient, another group of Britons, who have been visiting Goa for decades, decided to help out. Cath Hargreaves and David Morphey used their Facebook group and local contacts to keep foreigners updated about flights operated by other nations. Simultaneously, Morphey acted as a liaison with the British High Commission on behalf of over 1,000 British nationals stuck in Goa.

But if one wants to find the true spirit of atithi devo bhava, the small family-run hotels in the Cavelossim-Varca belt are the place to go. In Tamborim at Dona Sa Maria, hotelier Serafino Cota has offered tourists stay at his hotel for free till they get a chance to fly out. “As of now, we are offering tourists a place to stay and food at cost, something like a western thali. The guests said that they can afford to pay till March 31. After that I have told them I shall not charge,” Cota said.

Then those scripts were sent out to 500 organisations which are in some way associated with the NIEPVD. These 500-odd organisations work for the benefit of physically and intellectually disabled people and each organisation caters to more than 700 people with disabilities of different kinds.“Later, we realised that it’s better not to pass on information through some paper since it can act as a carrier for the coronavirus. So, it was better to pass on most of the information through electronic mode, a non-touchable mode,” said Nachiketa Rout, director of NIEPVD.Despite the staff not being able to come to the institute, the audio and video files are being churned out on a daily basis. In order to make sure that there is no shortage of content, the institute is making use of its staff which works in its Composite Regional Centre in Sunder Nagar, Himachal Pradesh “Our staff converted all the advisories into audio formats. In order to access the audio, we placed QR codes on e-pamphlets which can be found on our website and they have been circulated across other organisations too. The e-pamphlets have summarised points but in order to get to know in detail one has to scan the QR code. For instance, the e-pamphlet will have a point to maintain social distancing but in order to know the reason behind, one has to scan the QR code and get the details in audio format. We also have a team in Sunder Nagar which is also contributing to content material,” added Rout.The institute also converted advisories into video formats for hearing-impaired people.Rout further said, “Later, we realised that there is a large community of hearing-impaired people and it is important for them also to be aware of Covid-19. So we decided to convert advisories into video formats too in which they will be explained in sign language.“Our institute generally caters to only visually impaired people. Yet we produced sign language videos for the hearing disabled people so that they don’t feel left behind and know about preventive measures against Covid-19. The communication between a deaf and a blind is next to impossible and we have content which is made for both of them available on our NIEPVDwebsite.”The NIEPVDs efforts were appreciated by the ministry of social justice and empowerment. Recently, one of the videos made by the institute was even shared on the Prime Minister’s Twitter handle. The institute told TOI that the circulation of their content is increasing daily.NIEPVD will soon come up with a 5-minute daily health bulletin in which measures against Covid-19 will be read out. They will also be told in sign language.",dehradun,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74914805,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-113114,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/how-a-doon-institute-is-readying-visually-hearing-impaired-people-for-a-fight-against-covid-19/articleshow/74891939.cms

More than 15,000 people, including film personalities and sportspersons , enrolled themselves as volunteers within a week of its launch.

Speaking to TOI, commission chairperson Chintha Jerome said as the chief minister wanted the youths to volunteer themselves to serve as bystanders, the commission asked those joining the force to indicate whether they are ready to function as bystanders.

“Actually, we never expected such a massive response. But, out of the 15,000 youths who have registered online as volunteers, 1,465 of them have consented to be deployed as bystanders,” she said. She also pointed out that while the “sannadham” volunteer force being constituted by the government is enrolling youth between 22 and 40 years, the youth defence force is enrolling those aged between 18 and 40 years.

“We have film stars Tovino Thomas, Sunny Wayne, director Arun Gopi, footballer C K Vineeth among those registered online. Directors Major Ravi and Sreekumar Menon also have offered to join though they have already crossed the age limit,” she added.

Half of those enrolled are young women. Once the list of the youth defence force is ready, local bodies could conveniently deploy them, Jerome said adding that once the crisis related to Covid-19 spread is over, the commission would consider providing training to the force.

Earlier, police had only made deployments at important junctions and allowed those who came to purchase essentials.

Meanwhile, corporation officials closed down around 50 shops in various parts of the city including Ellis Nagar, Kamarajar Salai, South Veli Street and South Marret Street for operating the stores by violating restrictions and without streamlining customers with the mandatory social distancing.

A large number of residents came out of their houses and roamed around the city to purchase vegetables, meat, fruits and groceries. Most of the markets represented a normal day as people threw curfew restrictions to the wind. Appalled over the people’s behaviour, police ushered in stricter measures to close down all the bridges.

Except those like the AV Bridge, Yaanaikkal Puthupalam, PTR Bridge and Kamarajar Bridge, where people are let in for essential purposes, others like the Kuruvikkaran Salai Bridge, Temporary Road in Vaigai river next to Kurivikkaran, Obulapadithurai bridge, MGR Bridge, Amma bridge and LIC Bridge were completely shut. Good vehicles carrying essentials, vehicles with pass and ambulances were allowed to pass.

A police officer said, “Monday was better as there were fewer vehicles on the road due to stringent restrictions. People start violating social distancing norms even if we relax the measures a bit.”

A large number of shopkeepers were arrested for opening shops, violating curfew norms. They were released later. Although there is an instruction not to open grocery stories in East Masi Street for retail, many had opened on Sunday morning, causing heavy crowd. Many shopkeepers were booked by the city police. They were strictly warned against open shops only at night for wholesale trading. A total of 43 cases were registered on Sunday, mostly against shopkeepers, for violating the restrictions.

Madurai district police registered 225 cases against people for wandering unnecessarily on roads and arrested 294 people. A total of 196 vehicles were impounded.

SURAT: He had just finished his routine work of cremating an unclaimed body of a beggar at Jehangirpura crematorium when he received a call from a health officer of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) for disposing of the body of a 67-year-old man, the first COVID-19 fatality in Gujarat on March 22.

Without giving a second thought of getting infected with the deadly virus, he reached Mahavir Hospital in Athwalines where the COVID-19 positive man had breathed his last.

Abdul Rehman Malbari, 51, is president of Ekta Trust, an NGO which has been providing funeral service for abandoned and unclaimed bodies for the last three decades. He performed the last rites of the COVID-19 victim with his three team members at Umara crematorium. The loved ones of the victim were too scared to go near the body out of fear of getting infected.

“I don’t remember putting on masks or gloves in my 32 years of service. But this case was very different. I was made to cover my entire body with four pairs of protective clothes. We lifted the body, kept in our ambulance and drove towards the crematorium at Umara. There we were asked to put our protective clothes at the crematorium too. All four of us and our vehicle were disinfected. After 30 minutes of exercise and standing under the sunlight, we left the crematorium with prayers that there should be no more deaths due to COVID-19,” he said.

As the news spread that he had cremated a COVID-19 dead, people began to keep distance while talking to him. “For a few days, I had to face social distancing from even people close to me. Only my family members were not scared. When the people saw that I was healthy, they started coming closer to me without any fear,” said Malbari, father of four children and a loving husband.

Lockdown or no lockdown, Malbari’s voluntary funeral service never stops. He is single point contact for the administration for the disposal of unclaimed bodies. “Even during lockdown, my work has not stop. Apart from spreading awareness on COVID-19, we dispose of about three unclaimed bodies with dignity at crematoriums and graveyards every day,” says Malbari, who has disposed of more than 70,000 unclaimed bodies in the last three decades.

Malbari’s Ekta Trust has won accolades from the state government and the local administration for rendering its services during natural disasters, be it devastating floods in Uttarkhand in 2013, Tsunami in Chennai, earthquake in Kutch in 2001 and floods in Surat in 2006.

Dr Ashish Naik, deputy municipal commissioner), said, “Malbari is the only contact in the city for disposing of unclaimed bodies. Since Malbari has wide experience in handling decomposed bodies, we asked him to dispose of the body of COVID-19 victim.”

The new wages will become applicable from April 1.

MNREGS wages for UP had been increased by Re 1 in 2016-17 to Rs 175, remained stagnant in to-18 and 2018-19 and was hiked by Rs 7 to Rs 182 in 2019-20.Additional commissioner, MNREGS, Yogesh Kumar said the wage increase will help in tackling rural distress and raise consumption to boost rural economy. The wages are fixed by the Centre on the basis of inputs given by social research organisations. States with higher economic productivity have been receiving higher wages under MNREGS, he added.

“The states like UP and Uttarakhand had been lagging due to this and hence the increase this year is significant and can help 85 lakh people who have active job cards,” Kumar told TOI. Dadar and Nagar Haveli and Maharashtra have registered highest increase in MNREGS wages of Rs 34 and Rs 32 respectively. Likewise, MNREGS wages in Gujarat and Punjab have been upwardly revised by Rs 25 and Rs 22 respectively.

LUCKNOW: Thousands of migrant workers from neighbouring states and districts thronged Lucknow on Monday.

The workers had reached Lucknow from Rajasthan, Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, and Maharashtra in the hope of getting means of transportation to reach their native places in eastern Uttar Pradesh .

Most were stopped and taken to Haj house on Kanpur Road for thermal scanning, while others coming from Agra Expressway were taken to Awadh Shilp Gram located on Rae Bareli Road.

In neighbouring districts including Unnao, Sitapur, Hardoi, Bahraich, Kanpur, Sultanpur and Amethi, too, migrant workers were scanned for temperature before being let in.

Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) buses stationed at border areas in Lucknow ferried 3,000 workers to their respective districts in 30 buses on Monday. Majority of the workers had arrived from National Capital Region (NCR).

“We have travelled 500km without proper food. We got no help after our tea stall was closed down in Ghaziabad. It catered to an MNC,” said Murli Vishwakarma of Bahraich district. Murli, with his family of six, had come all the way on foot.

Nagendra Kumar, who repaired watches in Delhi, was forced out of his rented room in Lajpatnagar a day after the lockdown. “My belonging were thrown out and I have been walking on foot since,” said Kumar, a native of Azamgarh.

CMO Sitapur Alok Verma said that his team of 50 workers was on duty to scan each migrant at Khairabad toll plaza. The district administration claims to have tested 5,000 workers.

District magistrate of Hardoi Pulkit Khare said that a team of health officials and police was scanning workers at Numaish crossing before they were sent to their villages. In Sultanpur and Amethi, the administration have scanned 4,000 workers. In Baharich, 2,500 were scanned on Monday.

312,['31/03/2020'],GST waiver sought on equipment bought to combat Covid-19 using MPLADS,"Madurai: More than Rs 10 lakh is the GST paid by Rajya Sabha MP A Vijayakumar for the purchase of emergency health care equipment for the Kanyakumari government medical college hospital using his Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) fund. Last week the MP had allotted Rs 1 crore from his fund to strengthen preparedness to combat Covid-19.

The MP circulated a copy of the purchase order on social media to improve transparency. While the people of Kanyakumari have appreciated his contribution, the GST is attracting criticism as the amount is huge. Some said it is the price of three ventilators in the order.

“GST is applicable on all the sanctions using MPLADS. Effectively, around Rs 50 to Rs 75 lakh is deducted as GST from Rs 5 crore allotted annually under MPLADS. I am not against GST, but the government could consider waiving GST on emergency healthcare equipment bought to combat Covid-19. It will ensure that more money is spent on buying equipment,” Vijayakumar told TOI.

Vijayakumar said he will allot a sizeable share of his MPLADS for 2020-21 too for this cause and hopes the government will waive the 12% GST for this cause from April 1.

Madurai MP Su Venkatesan who has made a first instalment allotted Rs 56.17 lakh from MPLADS for lifesaving medical equipment and protective gear for health care professionals at the Madurai medical college hospital. “When the availability of ventilators is hit, why should GST be charged on it? The government should make lifesaving equipment GST free,” he said.

Tirunelveli MP S Gnanathiraviam who has allotted Rs 86 lakh from MPLADS said that the government should consider waiving GST for purchase of lifesaving equipment.

Vijayakumar got the equipment including nine ventilators installed at the Kanyakumari hospital by making multiple calls to people concerned and through highly influential persons in the health ministry as they talked of difficulty in getting the equipment delivered due to political pressure and tough competition from private hospitals pan India on the companies that have limited resources.

“I am planning to share difficulties I faced in getting the equipment in the social media,” Venkatesan said. Tuticorin MP Kanimozhi Karunanidhi has also allotted Rs 1 crore from MPLADS for purchase of testing, screening and personal protection equipment for healthcare professionals and for the purchase of other facilities in connection with combating Covid-19.

The locality depends on two Sanchi parlours for its milk supply. Both the parlours have been shut from Monday, bringing the supply to a halt. The colony consumes over 600 liter of milk per day. As the people at the ‘ground zero’ have been barred from stepping out of their homes, they are left with no alternative to buy milk.

The entry points to the colony have been totally sealed. On an usual day, the supply chain of government-owned Sanchi milk starts in the midnight. Trucks carrying milk used to reach the colony around 4am.

“They have stopped milk supply saying that it will not be supplied till further orders by the state government,” owners of the parlour agency said.

People in the colony are now left with no option but to search for alternatives like packaged milk powder.

Rajesh Chaturvedi, a resident said, “All the people in the colony are complying against the government’s order that blocked the milk supply to the locality. But the essential commodities should be supplied.”

“Except the public announcement by the police to stay indoors and putting barricades on the entry points, nothing has been done. Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) units are yet to sanitize the area near my house,” said another resident, Lokendra Sharma, who lives near one of the two Sanchi parlours.

After the ‘patient zero’ was detected on March 22, the residents were in shock. Five days later, it was declared containment area (CA). Since then, there has hardly been any movement of the administration in the form of some survey or sanitization operations.

Two most important measures mentioned in the CA order issued by the additional district magistrate of Bhopal on Friday night include screening by the health officers at the exit points of the colony. The other is related to sanitization by the municipal corporation.

Containment area is defined as the first contact area of the reported positive case. The order also talks about no movement of people and vehicles in the defined zone.

The mobile markets launched by the civic body also become a hit among the residents.

“I was about to buy 1kg of tomatoes for Rs 48 from the retailer in my area, when the corporation’s mobile market arrived at the very spot and I was able to buy the same for half the price,” said Santhanagopal of Karpagam Nagar.

The corporation has moved main markets including the Mattuthavani vegetable market and Thayir market to 14 main roads in the four zones of the corporation, where social distancing was better maintained. “I went to the new market for the first time and was relieved to see that there was good distance between me and the next buyer behind me and we were also able to buy things faster,” said Asokan who went to the market near Aavin junction on Monday.

“The vegetable price at the retail market is very high. I can only buy two items including onions and tomatoes for Rs 100 now, and it is difficult because I have not been working for the past few days,” said Arunkumar, a construction worker. He is forced to buy vegetables and groceries on a daily basis, and has to manage all with Rs 150.

People are now eager to know the locations and timings of the mobile markets at their wards. Residents associations have been receiving eager queries in this regard.

Priests of the temple said no official or separate order announcing the cancellation of the annual festival had been issued by the district authorities or temple administration. “There is nothing more to say except that we are following the lockdown rules. It is clearly mentioned that no religious congregation or function can be observed during the lockdown. More than five persons cannot assemble at one place,” said Khurda collector Sitanshu Rout.

The district administration did not impose any restriction on the construction of the chariot, which was on for the past few days. The cancellation of the rath, thus, has led to resentment among priests and carpenters. “We had been working every day for the past three weeks from 9 am to 10 pm. Nearly a thousand logs had been collected for the construction of the chariot. Only the painting of the chariot was to be done,” said Batakrushna Maharana, the carpenter heading the team of artisans.

316,['31/03/2020'],"Life during curfew, first in three decades","Women distribute food among needy in Kamla Park in Bhopal on Monday

Bhopal: Residents in the state capital are witnessing a ‘curfew’ after almost three decades (since December 1992 (during riots post-Babri mosque demolition), but this is very different from those in the past. It warrants voluntary stay at home without a law and order issue to keep oneself and others safe.

Old time residents – the true Bhopalis— recount curfews in 1982 after dispute over a temple in Somwara, now famously known as Curfew Wali Mata Ka Mandir, in November 1984 after the assassination for former prime minister Indira Gandhi and in December 1984 after the leak of poisonous gas from the Union Carbide factory and in December 1992 in the aftermath of Babri demolition.

But, this curfew is very different from the past ones staying indoors to stay fight and fight an unknown enemy in the form coronavirus and try to flatten its curve before it becomes a community spread.

Many residents have had no experience of curfew till now, have been reasonably prompt in coming to terms with curfew- a word derived from ""Curfew Bell"", which was rung in the evening in Medieval England as a signal for everyone to go to bed.

""My son Pundarikh is very fond of roaming around with friends. He is a B Com first year student. I also felt that children of his age should engage themselves in outdoor activities more rather than engaging themselves over mobile but it's just the opposite now. We are asking him to restrict himself to home and he is willfully obliging"", said B R Sharma, a government servant.

It was during ""janata curfew"" observed at the call of the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, on Sunday that the first Coronavirus patient was detected in Bhopal and since the city had responded overwhelmingly to ""janata curfew"" which saw even milk booths and medical shops remaining closed and eerie silence haunting the busy roads all over the city and district collector thought it fit to put the city under lockdown after the ""janata curfew"" ended at 9.00 pm and after Shivraj Singh Chouhan took oath as the chief minister, he declared curfew in both the places where Coronavirus patients have been found -Jabalpur (six Coronavirus patients detected so far) and Bhopal (one patient). This quick succession of undeclared and declared ""curfew"" has indeed caught many families off guard as far as provision of essentials is concerned.

At a super market in Basant Kunj, an upmarket Colony in Gulmophar area, a number of people, who came asking for grocery items (flour, rice or pulses) were returned empty-handed at 9.00 pm since the store was being closed apparently due to exhaustion of stock. This despite the fact that grocery shops have been exempted from curfew.

Petrol pumps are also open but there is no crowd there as people are largely staying indoors and of course staying away from vehicles as well.

It is also a ""good"" occasion for many families, whose children are out for studies ore in job outside, and not only they are staying indoors due to lock down but their children have also come back from cities like Bengaluru, Delhi or Pune, which are more prone to spread ofcoronavirus than Bhopal.

""Of course, we are all worried over spread of Coronavirus and its socio-economic impact but we are happy, too, because it's for the first time in years that my son, who is an engineer in Bengaluru and daughter, who studies in Pune have come back and we are also a leisure to spend time with them"", said RC Rai, a retired government official.

""Having good food, leisurely talk and watching web series or short stories over TV together or laptop separately has been our routine for past few days"", he added. But, unlike Rai, there is a sizeable population mainly comprising students or people staying alone from their families, who are having tough time finding food as all the eateries, hotels and restaurants are closed.

""I work in a restaurant. When restaurant is open, we all eat there. But, it is now closed. I have to cook food at home. It's not difficult but I don't have provisions to cook but somehow, with help from my neighbours, I am managing it, said Pappu, a waiter at an MP Nagar restaurant.

Labourers and roadside vendors is another group, which shall find itself in financial crisis, if the curfew remains in force for a longer period.

The 74-year-old man had attended a religious gathering in Delhi where he developed cold and fever. Though he went to a couple of private hospitals, doctors did not suspect that he was carrying the deadly virus.That he was a victim of Covid-19 became clear only after his death. That the funeral rites were conducted in isolation with only his brother attending it has trigged a debate on how to dispose the body of a Covid-19 victim. Since this is a new disease it is not clear whether the body will continue to harbour the virus after the death, and if so, for how long.The World Health Organisation (WHO) has a clear protocol to deal with the bodies of people, who die due to cholera, Ebola and Marburg. But it has no formal guidelines to deal with Covid-19 bodies. However, the WHO on March 24 came out with interim guidelines on “Infection prevention and control for the safe management of a dead body in the context of Covid-19”.These interim guidelines are valid till a more specific protocol is announced after studying the infection chances etc. “This interim guidance is for all those, including managers of health care facilities and mortuaries, religious and public health authorities, and families, who tend to the bodies of persons who have died of suspected or confirmed Covid-19.These recommendations are subject to revision as new evidence becomes available,” the WHO official statement said. As this is a new virus whose source and disease progression are not yet entirely clear, more precautions may be used until further information becomes available, it added.According to Muslim religious scholars, funeral prayers in absentia can be performed in several cases of infectious diseases like cholera, plague, Ebola and now Covid-19.

A few places are under consideration to shift these markets, where sales can be carried out without causing any threat of the virus spread. One of the places shortly listed is a ground in Kamarajarpuram. Levelling of ground has started by deployed earthmovers,” a corporation official said, adding that an official announcement will be made soon.

Visakan said that meat sales will continue to take place in Nelpettai. “Only fish sales will be shifted to other places, similar to how vegetable markets were decentralized. The shift will help manage the crowds better,” he said.

321,['31/03/2020'],Budget passed under Covid shadow,"Bhubaneswar: Thermal scanning of MLAs wearing masks and use of hand sanitizers at the entrance gate marked the day-long proceedings of the second phase of budget session amid the coronavirus scare here on Monday.

The assembly passed the state’s Rs 1.50 lakh crore budget for the coming fiscal (2020-2021) in the absence of chief minister Naveen Patnaik and attendance of around 80 of the 147 members at the convention centre of Lok Seva Bhawan.

The location was chosen because seven employees of the assembly had come in contact with the state’s third Covid-19 patient, a 60-year-old banker. Speaker SN Patro had directed that the assembly and its premises should be sanitized and had asked the employees to go for home isolation.

The MLAs sat around 1.8 metres away from each other. Replying to the brief debate on the budget, finance minister Niranjan Pujari said, “I am seeking passage of the appropriation bill unanimously amid state’s firm resolve to contain the spread of coronavirus. This will give us more strength to fight the virus and to spend on other public welfare initiatives.”

The finance minister regretted the fact that elaborate debate on various aspects of the budget could not be held because the session had to be curtailed in view of coronavirus scare.

The budget was presented in the assembly on February 18. The speaker had adjourned the proceedings from March 16 to March 29 as part of the efforts to contain the spread of the virus. “The appropriation bill was unanimously passed,” BJD MLA Amar Prasad Satpathy told the media.

Taking part in the debate, leader of opposition Pradipta Naik said the government should take all into confidence to fight the spread of the virus. Congress legislature party leader Narasingha Mishra said the opposition is firmly behind the governments at the Centre and the state in the fight against this health challenge. “However, the government should also take the opposition into confidence and convene an all-party meeting. This will instil more confidence among the public,” he said. The opposition also lauded the role being played by the doctors in treating patients as well as the police in ensuring the lockdown.

LUCKNOW: Banks and treasury would remain open on Ram Navami on April 2. Principal secretary, religious affairs, Jitendra Kumar said that UP had declared bank holiday on Ram Navami under the Local Instruments Act. Under this act, the state is empowered to declare a holiday in banks and also in financial institutions which come under control of the Central government .

As Ram Navami is celebrated in a grand way in UP, the state government had decided to declare bank holiday the same day. However, in other states banks function normally on Ram Navami. Now, Yogi government has reversed its earlier decision and declared that banks would function on Ram Navmi day on April 2 along with state treasuries.It would enable the state government to transfer funds to banks through treasuries. The banks would then credit the money in the account of workers, labourers and farmers under various welfare schemes run by the state government.

In this hour of need, Abdul Razak, a local electrician, has stepped up to provide his services free-of-cost.

“Whenever there is a crisis, I keep thinking of ways to help people. For instance, I came up with a jacket coated with bee wax for Indian soldiers serving in extremely cold temperatures at the border,” said Razak.

As the lockdown implemented owing to Covid-19 has restricted movements, Razak came up with the gesture as he has no difficulty in moving about being a member of the Red Cross.

People have told Razak that it is difficult to find a TNEB electrician, like when the fuse burns out. “If the problem is something that I can solve, I go to the spot in a few minutes and set it right. The gratitude of the people is my biggest reward,” Razak said.

Since the lockdown was announced last week, he has provided his services free-of-cost to 20 people who contacted him on his phone. Malarvizhi of Bibikulam said she was cooking when her mixer grinder stopped working. “I felt helpless, because I couldn’t take it for repairs and buying a new one was out of the question. My neighbour told me about Razak and I called him. My problem was fixed.”

In another instance, when a ceiling fan stopped working at a house in KK Nagar, J Sugumar’s young child and elderly parents were badly affected because of the summer heat. “I was lucky to get Razak’s number and he set it right in a few minutes.

327,['31/03/2020'],Tamil Nadu Corona Update: Tamil Nadu yet to mobilise 1 lakh idle doctors to take on Covid-19 crisis,"Picture used for representational purpose only

CHENNAI: About one lakh doctors engaged in private practice in the state are idle with clinics shut, but Tamil Nadu is yet to ready them to tackle coronavirus cases should there be an outbreak.

Maharashtra and Bihar are preparing to rope in private doctors to handle such an eventuality and experts said it was high time Tamil Nadu trained the doctors by organising online classes on how to handle Covid-19 cases.

Tamil Nadu has 1.4 lakh registered doctors of whom nearly 20,000 work in government-funded hospitals. Many private hospitals, particularly speciality care centres run by ophthalmologists, psychiatrists and ENT specialists, are shut for a week.

Dr Thilak, a dermatologist from Anna Nagar, said, ""As we don’t know who could be a carrier of the virus, it is unsafe for both us and patients. We didn’t want hospitals to become the source of infection.""

A K Ravikumar, state secretary of Indian Medical Association (IMA), said many private hospitals and clinics are not only ready to send their doctors but also allow government to use their available hospital space and infrastructure. But these doctors should be screened before they are allowed to work to ensure that there is no community spread, said Dr C Ashok, a general physician from Thanjavur.

Government hospital doctors said procuring additional personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves and masks for these private doctors will be a challenge as the government has struggled to meet demands of the existing workforce.

To eliminate this, the IMA had proposed a model to director of public health (DPH). According to it, selected hospitals (one in every 3km) in the state can be declared dedicated fever and respiratory clinics. Any fever or respiratory cases will be referred and treated only in these dedicated centres and entry for all other cases should be barred. It would be easier for the government to train doctors for these centres.

""By this, we can also restrict the demand of PPEs and more importantly we will have enough doctors in case of an eventuality,"" Ravikumar said.

This model will also ensure that other patients can approach hospitals without any fear as currently many were restricting visits to government hospitals in districts which have an isolated ward in one of the blocks, said a house surgeon from Tiruvarur GH.

Joint council of state service organizations asked all government employees should to contribute a month’s salary to the CMDRF. The council general secretary S Vijayakumaran Nair said part-time employees, last-grade employees and employees fighting chronic diseases should be exempted from contributing their salary. The government’s attempt to collect salaries without the prior consent of employees had backfired last time. This time, however, the government is keen to strike a consensus with all service organizations so that all would declare their consent voluntarily. The appeal, said service organization leaders who participated in discussions with the chief minister here on Monday, is to contribute a month’s salary in instalments not exceeding 10 months.

Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said the opposition would cooperate with the call, provided the details of the same is worked out in consultation with all concerned. “We welcome the salary challenge proposed by the government. But whether a full month’s salary should be contributed by all employees demands a second thought.

The results indicate that the present lockdown, which will end by April 14, may be insufficient as it may bring down the number of cases by mid-April, but the infection could resurge quickly to infect more than 6,000 by mid-May. Longer periods of lockdown could curtail the infection and bring the numbers below 10.""At present, we have no means of controlling the infection other than social distancing. Lockdown seems to be the only viable option,"" said Ronojoy Adhikari who conducted the study with Rajesh Singh.The model has helped the researchers predict the rate of mortality across different age groups. In the absence of social distancing, the study warns that nearly a million people in their sixties, around nine lakh in their fifties and around 3.7 lakh in their forties are at risk.With effective lockdown periods, the study estimates the mortality at eight in the three-lockdowns with five-day break and six for a 49-day lockdown.Along with lockdown and social distancing, extensive testing and mapping affected regions are lso important. ""District-level testing should be started. Once infection levels are manageable, we will need to ensure that infected individuals and their contact networks are traced and quarantined,"" Adhikari said.But even after the lockdown period, the researchers suggest that extensive screening at various points of entry and mandatory self-isolation be continued, as a large population could still be susceptible to the virus and entry of new positive cases from across the borders could start the chain of infections again.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74910129,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-73560,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/longer-lockdown-can-contain-virus-research/articleshow/74902279.cms

CHENNAI: Star hotels across the city are shut for customers due to the countrywide lockdown. While suspension of flights has led to no new bookings, the industry is staring at heavy losses as maintaining star hotels is expensive.

Several hotels are offering takeaways through food delivery apps and keeping dine-in facilities for guests who checked in before the lockdown came into effect. Such guests include long staying occupants on official assignments and those stranded due to the curbs in movement, accounting for a ratio of two rooms occupied for every 100 rooms.

Sources say a five star hotel with a minimum of 150 rooms spends between Rs 4 lakh and Rs 5.2 lakh towards upkeep, including staff salaries and power, everyday, while it is Rs 3.2 lakh for four star and three star hotels. ""Hotel business is like the airline industry which generates revenue only when aircraft are flying,"" said a general manager at a four star hotel.

The city has 200 star hotels including 150 3 star establishments, most of them on Anna Salai, OMR and GST Road. While some are offering up to 20% discounts for resident guests to remain there until April 14, others are accommodating staff in banquet halls and rooms. Those that are offering takeaways through food delivery apps are coming up with attractive rates.

South India Hotels and Restaurants Association honorary secretary T Nataraajan said such a long closure was unprecedented. ""A few hotels were shut for some months due to damage from floods in 2015. Though hotels were covered under insurance, Covid-19 does not come under ambit of insurance,"" he said.

341,['31/03/2020'],Weavers Demand Central Help,"Mangalagiri: Weaver towns across the state are silent as looms have stopped working.

Weavers are pioneers of the concept of working from home but the ongoing lockdown has left them jobless. With retail cloth stores shut across the country, master weavers (employers of the small weavers) have stopped engaging the weavers.

With no other means of livelihood, weavers are among the hardest-hit in the national lockdown.

A majority of handloom workers are low wage earners with a monthly family income below Rs 5,000. A family of three or four members struggle to earn the paltry sums. Although skilled to make the yarn into tiny strings and produce a colourful outfit, they are struggling to make both ends meet.

“There has been no work for the past 10 days. I cannot afford to take my ailing mother to hospital as the situation outside is also worrisome,” said Ganji Anjaneyulu, a handloom weaver.

Summer is business season for handloom weavers as they get their bulk of work decent wage during this period. The demand for handloom fabric goes up in the summer.

Master weavers usually procure orders from across the country during February and March and engage small-time weavers to complete the orders. With Covid-19 slowly impacting one nation after another, the exporters and wholesalers have stopped placing orders with the local master weavers since February.

This has resulted in dip in work at field-level even before the lockdown was announced by the Centre and state governments. “We are surprised by the Centre’s package, which completely ignores the plights of handloom weavers. We request the Centre to grant immediate financial assistance to all the weavers to prevent starvation deaths,” said Macherla Mohan Rao, president, National Federation of Handlooms and handicrafts (NFHH).

342,['31/03/2020'],‘Tiff over sealing of borders’ as Taj city turns transit route for migrant workers,"Agra: With the city of Taj turning into a transit route for hundreds of migrant workers from the national capital and neighbouring states in the wake of the Centre’s strict orders to follow the 21-day nationwide lockdown to fight Covid-19, a regulation of traffic between the districts turned into a brief flashpoint between the authorities of Agra and Firozabad districts on Monday.

Tundla SDM KP Singh Tomar said, “An Agra police sub-inspector had blocked the highway with barricades on the border of two districts and didn’t even allow essential services such as ambulance to enter Agra from Firozabad. This also caused traffic jam.” Most of these workers are coming from Bharatpur (Rajasthan), Morena (Madhya Pradesh), Faridabad (Haryana) and Delhi, and using the city as a transit route.

Later, tehsildar and Tundla CO rushed from Firozabad to the spot, while from Agra, under-trainee IPS Somendra Meena reached the spot with his men. A video clip of the argument between the two district officials in the middle of the NH-2 on Firozabad-Agra border went viral. Here, Tundla tehsildar Gajendrapal Singh and IPS under-trainee Somendra Meena were found shouting at each other to stop their side of the traffic from entering into other districts.

Superintendent of police (rural west), Ravi Kumar of Agra said, “Our officers handled the situation professionally. People should understand Agra is a transit route for hundreds of migrant workers coming from Delhi, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. On Sunday, we had arranged over 2,000 public transport services like buses, trucks and even tractor-trollies to move them out. Many of them had walked their way into Agra. Thousands are still stranded in Agra and we have sent them to temporary quarantine facilities with food, water and other necessary items. After the Centre’s strict lockdown order, we have sealed our borders until further notice.”

Moreover, both the districts have decided not to allow any vehicles or pedestrian movement across the border, except for essential services like ambulance, food, grocery and medicine carrying trucks.

According to officials, food, drinking water, temporary shelters and toilet facilities have been arranged for people stuck near the borders. Arrangements were made in coordination with Bharatpur, Dholpur, Firozabad, Etawah, Mathura and Hathras district administrations.

District magistrate Prabhu N Singh said, “We have identified 32 places, mainly near the district borders, where we will cater to around 25,000 people. We are working to further increase the capacity. Duties have been assigned to officials to ensure adequate arrangements at these centres. We will take care of all the requirements of the migrant workers. They will be provided food, drinking water, mattresses and blankets to sleep. Toilet facility will be made available at all shelters.”

Meanwhile, UP CM Yogi Adityanath may visit Agra on Tuesday to “take stock of the situation”. “The chief minister is scheduled to visit Agra on Tuesday. He will be personally reviewing arrangements made for the migrants. He will also check our arrangements to prevent spread of coronavirus. He may conduct spot inspection at a few places,” he added.

The officer and his team have been counselling, guiding and offering help to migrant workers over phone.

“They are insisting on going back to their native villages in Uttar Pradesh. However, considering the current situation arising due to Covid-19, my team of five officials has been offering guidance to them and requesting that they stay back wherever they are, instead of trying to leave the state,” said Bimlesh Audichya, nodal officer who is coordinating with local bodies to take care of the workers.

“When we had detailed conversations with the workers, we realized their fear of going hungry was much lower than the longing to meet their near and dear ones. In fact, food figured last on their list of priorities,” Audichya added. “They relaxed after we arranged video calls with the sarpanch of their respective villages or with their relatives.

PANAJI: The Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) in Goa has evacuated more than 400 overseas nationals even as 1,000 others applied for extension of visas.

A senior police officer with the FRRO said that out of the 400 evacuated, 300 are from the United Kingdom, 60 from France, 30 from the Czech Republic and the rest from various European nations. There are 1,600 foreign tourists in the state and chief minister Pramod Sawant said that by April 3 charter flights will arrive in the state to evacuate them. The CM, however, said that there is no confirmation yet on how many will actually leave.

On Sunday, TOI had reported that foreign nationals were facing a food and cash crunch due to the lockdown. Many of them were due to fly out of Goa in the last week of March, but were caught when international flights were cancelled.

The officer said that during evacuation police are directed not to stop foreigners travelling towards Dabolim airport.

Every year thousands of overseas tourists visit the state, with most coming from UK, Russia and Europe. Official data has revealed that many citizens from novel coronavirus-hit nations such as China, Italy, France and Spain have been residing in Goa since January.

KOLKATA: The rising number of Covid-19 patients and suspects has put private hospitals in Kolkata in a bind. It is a tightrope walk for them, who are serving to these patients on one hand, while keeping the rest of their patients insulated on the other.

With their infrastructural constraints — most have limited isolation facilities with the number of beds ranging between five and 12 — they are anxious about sticking to the prescribed isolation norms that could come under strain, they apprehend. Many are still grappling with a shortage of personal protection equipment (PPE) and fear that if the number of corona patients sees a sudden surge, they will have to stop admission.

AMRI has 16 isolation beds across two of its units. “The number of beds is limited and we can’t have more since isolation protocol wouldn’t permit that. Care must be taken to prevent transmission. While treatment is not an issue, infrastructure is restricted. We can’t take in more than 16,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. He added that shortage of PPEs was a worry. “So far, we have been able to manage with the stocks at our disposal. But we have never had enough PPEs and in case we run out of them, treatment will be hampered,” said Barua.

Peerless Hospital has 8-9 beds at its isolation ward and three at an ITU. “We will reach our limit if the number of patients keep climbing. Eventually, we will have to refuse. We have enough PPEs now but supplies have been erratic. We are worried that if stocks aren’t replenished more regularly, we won’t be in a position to follow treatment protocol,” said Peerless superintendent Sudipto Mitra.

With five isolation beds, RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) is striving to strike a balance between Covid suspects and other patients. Treating such patients in the absence of PPE puts the doctors and nurses at risk as well as increases the possibility of cross-infection, according to RTIICS zonal director R Venkatesh. He said RTIICS was hoping that the lockdown helps flatten the curve to prevent any major influx of corona patients.

Another student said, ""Colleges and universities have also postponed their exams. I don’t know when my second year classes will start.""

Even teaching faculty are also worried as what will happen after the lockdown period is over. ""Entire academic has been shut. This is a situation which will have very bad impacts in the long run. Students are really scared about their future,"" said a teaching faculty of Bhopal-based engineering college.

Engineering colleges which have been facing poor admission scenario are worried that this year they may get even lesser number of students compared to the last few years. ""It is possible that admission process in IIT and state engineering colleges may clash. Once the student moves out of the state there are possibilities that they will take admission in other states as the admission process may be delayed in the state. Different states have different academic calendars,"" said Ankit Soni, another student.

When contacted university officials on the condition of anonymity admitted that academic session will get delayed and it will impact students on a large scale.

The locations were rolled out to the volunteers by officials of Cyberabad Covid control room and twitteratis.

“We received ample support form Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) officials. We want to bridge the gap between authorities and the needy. I request people to help the migrant workers till the lockdown ends,” said Sai Teja an activist from the city.

A techie said that traffic police helped them by providing vehicles.“Cyberabad Traffic DCP Vijay Kumar arranged vehicles to transport food,” said Ramanjeet Singh, a techie. After videos of migrant workers were posted on twitter in Yousufguda, one techie reached out to them and provided food. The team is also co-ordinating with GHMC and police to ensure that the needy people are not starved. “After serving food to a group of 15 workers on Monday at Kukatpally Housing Board(KPHB), I reached out to police, who promised me that the migrant workers will be provided with food,” said U Surender, a techie.

KOLKATA/HOOGHLY: Health experts are concerned about the fact that the three Covid-19 cases reported from Kolkata and the suburbs on Sunday had neither travelled abroad in the recent past nor had come into contact with people who have tested positive till now.

After the three tested positive, the administration made efforts to sanitize their homes and places of work, but panic continues to prevail among family and friends. In fact, the positive report for the Hooghly resident has sent panic waves sweeping across localities in Durgapur, Bankura and Mathurapur in South 24 Parganas. Between March 13 and March 14, the 59-year-old resident of Gangulybagan in Sheoraphuli had travelled to Durgapur and Barjora in Bankura, stayed at a hotel and returned home by the Black Diamond Express.

“The next day, he visited his mother in Mathurapur with his wife. On March 16, he started feeling unwell and got admitted to a private clinic in Uttarpara. The next day, he shifted to a private hospital in Chandernagore’s Bagbazar. During his stay there, he also got his chest examined at a diagnostic centre. He later shifted to the hospital in Salt Lake, Kolkata, where he tested positive to Covid-19. The locality in Gangulybagan has been sanitized and the chest clinic at Chandernagore has been asked to close down for the time being. The private clinic at Shibtala in Uttarpara has also been sanitized. His wife, son, his brother and his family and driver are under observation,” a health official said.

The Baranagar resident suffered a lung infection in 2016 and hasn’t left home since. His brother, along with his wife and son travelled to Madhya Pradesh in March. On Wednesday, the former employee of another engineering firm developed serious respiratory trouble and got admitted to a nursing home in Lake Town where he tested Covid-19 positive. All remaining 20 members of his family from Niyogipara have been sent to quarantine and the locality sanitized.

The Army has also taken measures to find out details of people who may have come in contact with the colonel, an anaesthesiologist, from the Eastern Command Hospital. The officer travelled to Delhi between March 12 and March 17. “Army teams have isolated the facility and identified direct contacts of the doctor in Kolkata.

363,['31/03/2020'],"No point in opening units without raw material, open markets: Businessmen","LUDHIANA: The Punjab government’s decision to allow factories making non-essential goods to operate during lockdown has industrialists questioning the intentions behind the move.

Businessmen are not criticising the government’s decision. They are asking without supply of raw material and with complete closure of shops and establishments in other states, which are their biggest markets, how can they start manufacturing and where will they sell their finished good? Some businessmen claim the decision was taken so that the government could justify levying of minimum charges for power connections.

They say the conditions laid for opening the factories are way too harsh and ever since chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh announced the decision aimed at curbing the mass exodus of migrant workers, a large number of business associations have instructed their members not to apply for the permissions and they have been openly opposing the move on social media. They say it is not viable to go through the lengthy process and incur extra costs in operating the factories by fulfilling the conditions fixed by the government. Sources say members of business associations are peeved at not being consulted before taking the decision.

According to Jaswinder Thukral , president of Janta Nagar Small-Scale Manufacturers’ Association, “The decision is not going to help any micro or small unit. The small units require raw material and tools on a daily basis and when the shops are closed how will we procure these and start production? This is practically impossible and therefore the government must take its decision back immediately and keep the factories closed till April 14.”

Speaking to the TOI, Inderjit Singh Navyug , former president of United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers’ Association (UCPMA), says, “This is an impractical decision. Even if we meet the harsh conditions fixed for operating the factories and even source raw material and produce goods, it will be of no use because the entire market for cycle and cycle parts is in UP, Bihar, MP and Jharkhand. When these states are totally under lockdown, whom are we going to supply the goods to? This decision would have benefitted us only if the shops, commercial establishments in other states too were fully open and there was no restriction on movement of buyers in the markets.”

According to Varinder Rakheja, former president of Sewing Machine Dealers ’ and Assemblers’ Association, “How can the risk of opening factories amid this situation be taken? On one hand, the Central and the Punjab governments are pleading to comply with social distancing and on the other the state is asking us to open the factories. How will government ensure that the factories that resume work after obtaining the permissions are complying with all the norms?”

A large number of factories making essential goods like bread, buns, masks, among others, are already running in the city as they were accorded permission to run their operations subject to certain restrictions like number of labourers.

Applications for resuming work at units

A few applications for opening factories have reached the district industries centre (DIC), but sanctions may take time as the department is not ready to take any chances. It is likely that the government officials will inspect the factories to check if they fulfil the conditions laid down by the government, which include arrangement for boarding and food for workers, health check-up and social distancing during machinery operation.

PANAJI: After suspending operations for a week in light of the nationwide lockdown, the horticulture outlets run by the Goa State Horticulture Corporation Limited(GSHCL) resumed operations on Monday. The GSHCL has supplied around 268 metric tonnes of vegetables through its outlets.

While the corporation insisted on starting with home delivery of the greens, some store operators refused to resume the activity due to logistical issues with the delivery services. Approximately 1,000 of the 1,200-odd stores had operations running across the state.

“The vegetables have reached in all constituencies . Things will settle down in the next few days,” said GSHCL chairman Pravin Zantye .

GSHCL has sourced most of its vegetables – onions, tomatoes, potatoes, cabbage, cauliflower and French beans – from suppliers in Belagavi while green chillies, lady-finger and cluster beans have been sourced from local farmers in Goa.

Sources at the corporation said that the horticulture operators were maintaining social distance with shoppers at their outlets. However, most outlets managed to do home delivery through volunteers who were appointed by the local panchayat.

“People are not supposed to come to the outlets. We want the outlets to undertake home deliveries,” GSHCL managing director, Sandeep Faldesai said.

Meanwhile, of the three outlets on Divar island, only the single outlet near the Divar junction was selling vegetables on Monday. As residents lined up outside the outlet, sources said that the queue started extending till the fish market, almost a mile long.

Reason: the management does not want to risk its workforce by working during Covid-19 pandemic.However, a section of the DDK staff are complaining that by the time normalcy returns whatever little loyal viewership the public service broadcaster has these days will switch over to other popular satellite channels.DDK employees said that the management should have utilized its 400 strong manpower and resources to render support to people to tide over the challenge posed by Covid-19, by telecasting novel programmes. “While the entire world is fighting Covid-19 pandemic, we were ready to work and produce Malayalam content But the public service broadcaster is refraining from its duty,” said an anonymous source at DDK.Deputy director general Doordarshan and chief of DDK, Thiruvananthapuram, Sanjeev Sugathan said that he was only complying with his headquarters’ guidelines to avoid risking its employees’ lives. “Initially, 50% of the employees were asked to work from home.

The central government has announced that poor families will be provided with three months of ration for sustenance. The AAP said that this move of the government is a much-needed relief for the people. “We found that a vast majority of the ration shops are closed, and even those that were open were short on supply,” said AAP state secretary Dhananjay Shinde.

Maharashtra’s key cities like Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Aurangabad, Nagpur and Pimpri Chinchwad have a substantial population of migrant labourers and daily labourers, who are worst hit due to the lockdown and PDS through ration shops must work so as to ensure that their abject conditions are immediately alleviated, he said.

The members of the party conducted inspections at Kothe Galli, Panchavati in Nashik, Akurdi and Pimpri in Pimpri Chinchwad, Appar Pune, Hadapsar, Bhekrai Nagar- Phursungi in Pune, Gulmohar Colony, Bhadkal Gate, Jyoti Nagar, Satara Parisar, TV Center, Garkheda, Shivaji Nagar in Aurangabad, Manjri village, Tandulja in Latur, Reshim Bag, Medical Chowk, Mahal and Itavari in Nagpur.

KOLKATA: The state government has booked 700-odd rooms in various hotels and guest houses to put up doctors and nurses.

The rooms, being booked by KMC, are mostly near ID Hospital, SSKM Hospital and Calcutta Medical College & Hospital (MCH). While ID Hospital is the state’s only referral hospital for treating infectious diseases, SSKM Hospital or IPGMER on March 10 got approval for conducting Covid-19 tests and MCH has now been designated as the go-to facility for suspected patients.

The first batch of nine medics from ID Hospital handling Covid-19 cases have started staying in a Beliaghata guest house (Siliguri Atithi Nivas) on Beliaghata Main Road. A doctor said, “The list will grow longer because we are encouraging more and more nurses and doctors to live in the vicinity.” A senior official in KMC said, “Our priority was to look for stay-over options near ID Hospital because coronavirus tests are being done at NICED situated within the hospital.” The government will pay for the double- and triple-bedded rooms.

Arindam Biswas, consultant (general medicince), R N Tagore Hospital, welcomed the state preparedness.

“The doctors, nurses and other health caregivers are working round the clock. The authorities can’t have them covering long distances to reach their workplaces. That itself would be in violation of the lockdown, legally and clinically. An arrangement for 700 hotel rooms near the key hospitals look adequate at this point of time.”

An official in the state health department said, “ICMR has hinted that the disease may have infected patients outside the limited criterion of overseas travel history. The number is small but that’s an indicated that India is likely in Stage 3. Bengal must also be prepared for this.”

BENGALURU: A speeding ambulance hit five bikes before toppling on the motorcycle of a security official, killing him at Gangapura Gate, near Hoskote, on NH-75 in the early hours of Saturday.

The official, Ramesh Kumar Reddy, 37, a resident of Thanisandra and from Chittoor district in Andhra Pradesh, and his wife, Nandini Reddy, were fleeing to their village owing to the Covid-19 scare and lockdown in Bengaluru. Nandini survived the accident with minor injuries.

According to police, Reddy had stopped his bike on the road and was enquiring with other motorists about a Covid-19 checkpost ahead. The checkpost has been set up near Gangapura Gate to prevent people from entering Kolar district. A few motorists had stopped their bikes on the roadside and were talking to those who were sent back from the checkpost when the serial accident took place at 3.20am.

The ambulance driver moving towards Kolar lost control of the vehicle and hit six bikes, including Reddy’s. The ambulance toppled and landed on Reddy, killing him instantly.

“We were worried about Covid-19 and decided to head back to our village. We left home at Thanisandra around 1.30am. Some motorists informed us that police were not allowing vehicles to cross the checkpost. So, we stopped our bike and were waiting there along with other motorists when the incident took place,” police quoted Nandini as saying in her complaint.

Nandagudi police said four others were injured in the accident. The ambulance driver is in police custody.

Bhopal: There was a slump in the price of vegetables on Monday as more vendors and daily wage earners are taking to selling vegetables by the roadside, the only “option” left with them till the lockdown is lifted.

Dheeraj Singh, who has office in M P Nagar, was surprised when he randomly asked a vegetable vendor on a handcart the price of tomatoes and was informed, “Rs 10 per kg.” Last Thursday, Singh had bought tomatoes for Rs 50 a kg.

When Singh asked the vendor why he was selling them for so cheap, he replied: “Bechna to hai na saheb. Harek jagah to sabziwale baithe hain (we have to sell our stuff, after all. There are vegetable vendors in every nook and corner of the city nowadays”.

Green vegetables, onion and potatoes are also also available for the ‘before lockdown’ prices. Drumsticks, selling for Rs 60 per kg, was the costliest of all vegetables. The number of vegetable vendors has swelled to such an extent that in the stretch of one-and-a half km of Chuna Bhatti, there were as many as 15 vendors.

“I work with a welding shop. The shop has been shut since the day of janata curfew. I have no job now, so I need to earn some money to sustain my family,” said Jauhar, who was selling vegetables from outside a closed shop in Shahpura.

In addition, the ‘vegetable at your doorstep’ scheme initiated by the district administration to keep the prices of vegetables under check may also have helped restoring the prices of vegetables to normal.

“Supply of vegetables in the wholesale market was normal, but it was the vendors who were selling them at inflated prices. Now, it has been checked,” said an official of the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC).

Police have even started initiating action against those illegally transporting people in vehicles such as trucks and ambulances from other districts to Kolhapur.

On the very first day of the lockdown, police took action against 100 people for violating rules and even seized their vehicles. Police did not arrest anyone but registered cases and accordingly will take action against them once the lockdown period is over.

On the second day, police booked more than 400 people for coming out on the roads and seized their vehicles. However, realising that the exercise of seizing vehicles was not bearing desired result, police started blocking a part of the major roads with barricades. So far, barricades have been put up at 200 spots in roads and chowks.

Heavy police force has been deployed at all the roads connecting to Kolhapur district to ensure people entering the district do not have an international travel history or any connection with foreign nationals. The Kini and Kognoli toll plazas on national highway 4 connecting Pune and Bengaluru are being monitored to keep a check on people coming in. The rush on NH 4 reduced after superintendent of police Abhinav Deshmuhk warned that all those entering Kolhapur district from Pune and Mumbai would be put in institutional quarantine.

Continuing their action against violators, police registered cases against 70 people in the district for reasons like roaming on road without purpose, keeping shops open and selling liquor when it is completely banned.

Visakhapatnam: To cater to the requirement of oxygen supply for multiple patients during the ongoing pandemic , personnel from the Naval Dockyard, Visakhapatnam have designed an innovative ‘Portable Multi-feed Oxygen Manifold (MOM)’ using a six-way radial header fitted to a single cylinder .

This innovation will enable one cylinder to supply six patients with oxygen simultaneously, enabling critical care management to a larger number of Covid-19 patients with limited resources.

A typical oxygen providing facility at hospitals comprises an oxygen cylinder feeding only one patient through a ventimask arrangement. During the ongoing pandemic, ventilator support is required for five-eight per cent of patients, while a large number require oxygen support.

Existing facilities are not adequate to cater to such a large requirement. A need was felt to design a portable arrangement that could provide oxygen through masks to a number of patients using a single-cylinder.

After successful trials, the Naval Dockyard commenced the manufacture of 10 portable MOM with two six-way radial headers catering to 120 patients at makeshift locations.

While two of the accused have been identified as Aman Tidh and his brother Kanu, sons of liquor smuggler Lucky Tidh, of Durgapuri, Haibowal, police are yet to establish the identities of their two accomplices.

Dinesh Khanna, a make-up artist, said in his police complaint, “Around 11.45pm Saturday, I was going to drop my friend, Suresh Kumar , to his house in Tarsem Colony . When we reached near a dera in Haibowal Kalan , a sedan (a silver Hyundai Elantra) intercepted my car, a Hyundai i20 (PB913232). A turbaned man alighted from the sedan and walked towards us. As soon as I rolled down the window, he took out the car keys. Then Kanu came out of the sedan.”

Soon thereafter, Kanu’s brother Aman along with his accomplice reached there on a scooter. “At gunpoint, Kanu asked me and my friend to step out. After abusing us, Aman got into my car and drove off. The turbaned man sped away in his sedan and Kanu along with his accomplice escaped on the scooter,” Khanna added.

Khanna then called up the police. “I know Aman and Kanu as they live in my locality and are notorious criminals. But I do not have any rivalry with them. When police reached the spot, I along with them went to the brothers’ house and found my car parked there.”

The complaint was lodged on Sunday night.

On how the car was snatched amid curfew, Haibowal police station additional SHO sub-inspector Kuldeep Singh said, “As checkposts have been established in all areas, the accused could not escape with the car. We are on their lookout.”

Both Aman and Kanu were earlier booked for smuggling liquor. Aman also has an attempt to murder case against him as he had opened fire at a dhaba in Dadu Majra in February 2019, the cop added.

A case has been registered against the four under sections 392 (robbery), 506 (criminal intimidation), 34 (act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC.

The party also demanded that “all food stocked up by BJP MLAs should be immediately released” to avoid creating an artificial shortage.

“We demand that the chief minister and all BJP MLAs release the stock hoarded so that the artificially-created absence of essential commodities is relaxed,” said Girish Chodankar, adding that videos of the stock hoarded have gone viral on social media.

CHENNAI: Even during lockdown, politicians are making their presence felt by issuing statements, as usual, to media. The only difference is that they are confined themselves to their comfort zones in their houses. Most leaders said they were spending much of the time over phone, checking WhattsApp messages and making calls.

Some leaders like TNCC chief K S Alagiri had moved to their homes in their native villages to get some leeway to move around, before the lockdown started.

DMK chief M K Stalin starts his day with a walk inside his compound. Much of the time he spends talking to party functionaries, MPs and MLAs over phone to keep himself abreast of the ground reality across the state. He asks party leaders about availability of essential commodities, sanitizers and masks, said a DMK leader. He spends some time with the family members too.

On Monday, Stalin announced that the DMK would donate Rs 1 crore to the chief minister relief fund. A video in which Stalin speaks to party MPs, MLAs and district secretaries was released by the party.

TNCC chief K S Alagiri spends much of his time reading books. He has picked up one on Adi Shankaracharya for now. “As part of public life, I release videos about Covid-19 and ask each party cadre to keep calling at least 50 people to explain need for social distancing and keeping their area clean,” said Alagiri, who is staying in a small village near Chidambaram. He said he was enjoying the greenery and fresh air as his house is surrounded by large tracts of agricultural land.

Alagiri said he was re-discovering himself while reading a book on Adi Shankaracharya. “Shankaracharya’s philosophy brought people together. But I feel it is difficult to control mind,” said Alagiri.

CPM state secretary K Balakrishnan is busy speaking to party functionaries in Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. “My day starts with receiving calls from party cadres from across India. They want help for people from their states stuck in Tamil Nadu on account of lockdown. Though migrant workers want to go back to their states, it is not possible now as borders are sealed. I contact our cadres across the state and organise food and place for stay for the migrant workers wherever they are. Many Tamils stuck in Kerala seek help to return to Tamil Nadu. I explain the situation to them,” said Balakrishnan, who is staying in his residence in Chennai.

CPI state secretary R Mutharsan reads books and watches TV to while away time at his home in Chennai. “My routine has changed and the time spent on phone has increased. Confined to our homes, we are unable to provide help to those in need. Many suffer without accommodation and food,” he said. The government should increase the number of tests to identify new cases before there is an exponential growth in the number of patients, he said.

KOLKATA: Kolkata Police has suspended four cops —an assistant sub-inspector and three constables—for allegedly stopping trucks ferrying provisions and other essential goods and extorting money from them. A departmental inquiry has been initiated against the four, who belong to the Vidyasagar traffic guard and the Hastings police station’s Vidyasagar Setu outpost.

The incident took place on the Howrah-end of Vidyasagar Setu near Nabanna on Friday night. A businessman lodged a complaint with a senior officer on Saturday night, following which, DC (south) Meeraj Khalid and DC (traffic) Rupesh Kumar were asked to probe the incident. The two officers checked images of CCTV cameras on the bridge as well as its approach roads and made their recommendations. “We found suo motu evidence that raises suspicion. The accused cops were suspended in less than 36 hours of receiving the complaint. The probe will continue,” a senior officer said.

This is the first case of cops being suspended during the lockdown, imposed to minimise the spread of novel coronavirus, and the first time the force came under scrutiny. The swift action, said sources, was taken to send out two messages: one, that such unscrupulous act won’t be tolerated and two, to ensure that suppliers can have faith in police and run their business without facing harassment during lockdown. “While we hail the police good work, such dereliction of duty will not be accepted, especially when we are doing everything to ensure supply lines to markets are not hampered,” said an officer.

Cops on duty at places bordering Kolkata have also been sent strict instructions through their OCs not to break the law. Among various initiatives that police have been taking to help out traders, suppliers and retailers carry on business during the shutdown is the introduction of e-passes for food and medicine supply workers and setting up of helplines for those stranded on road. “We are sending our police teams across all major markets and grocery stores to collect reports on the functioning. We are ensuring that people do not have to pay through their nose. The supply of vegetables has increased and prices of vegetables have stabilized,” said an enforcement branch (EB) officer. “We received certain calls from traders in Koley Market that some trucks carrying essentials from districts were stopped at Burdwan and Dankuni. We called up the district police concerned and ensured the vehicles reached Kolkata,” said DC (EB) Biswajit Ghosh.

The latest report has taken the total number of Covid-19 positive cases in the Taj city to 11.

The UK returnee’s father is the owner of a group of private colleges. And the boy is a Class 11 student studying in Newcastle, UK. He along with his father visited the Agra district hospital on Saturday for tests. The samples were sent to King George’s Medical University (KGMU) and reports came out late on Sunday. His father has tested negative, so far.

After his return from the UK, the student was asked to maintain self-quarantine for a few days, sources said. The health department has now placed the entire house under lockdown and sanitised the area. Contact mapping and screening of people in the neighbourhood has begun.

Since March 2, as many as 11 Covid-19 cases have surfaced in Agra. Out of these, seven, including five members of a shoe exporter’s family, manager of the exporter’s factory and his wife, have been ‘cured’ and are currently quarantined at home. Three patients are being treated at the quarantine facility in SN Medical College.

On Monday, district magistrate (DM) Prabhu N Singh said, “Seven patients have been cured. Samples of railways employee’s daughter, who had returned from Europe and had initially tested positive, following treatment at SN Medical College, has now tested negative, twice. She will be released soon.”

“The health department is screening everyone who was in contact with the student. The neighbourhood is being sanitised. People are advised not to step out of their houses without any valid reason. They have been asked to call the helpline numbers ‘108’ and ‘102’ in case of any health issues,” the DM added.

Those who had stayed back, however, are being taken care of.

Sunil Bedmutha, the Aurangabad Credai secretary, said the workers were not willing to stay back without any work. About 15,000-17,000 workers were engaged in the city before the lockdown,” he said.

“The situation was already grim for the construction industry. The Covid-19 outbreak has delivered another blow. However, the workers are our responsibility, so we are taking care of them,” he added.

Credai officials said at least 300 sites were functioning earlier this month. Now, though all the work has come to a standstill, they had not allowed the workers at the sites to leave.

Developers said they had paid the workers enough to meet their daily expenses. Ramesh Nagpal, a senior architect and developer, said he had not allowed the workers to leave the sites and is taking care to provide them food and wages.

Nagpal, who runs two construction companies in Pune and Aurangabad, rued the exodus seen in Delhi. Also a former national chairman of the urban development committee of Indian Institute of Architects, he urged PM Narendra Modi to issue suitable orders to companies to look after the workers.

Credai Aurangabad president Narendra Singh Jabinda told TOI, “We told the workers that if they want to go, they could do so at their own risk. Otherwise, we will provide them enough to meet their expenses,” he said.

Jabinda and Bedmutha pointed out that on municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey’s request, the Credai has started a well-equipped quarantine ward at Kalagram. At least 10 people, who had come from Jordan, were quarantined there.

PANAJI/QUEPEM: With lack of essential commodities and poor access to groceries in the face of the ongoing nationwide lockdown to tackle the spread of Covid-19, villagers are turning to locally produced food for survival.

Most villagers continue to fetch items like onions, tomatoes and potatoes from grocery stores. Since vegetables like ladies’ fingers, cabbage and brinjal easily grow in Goa, their distribution is making small farmers unsung heroes for hungry Goans.

In some far-flung villages, small farmers move house to house selling their personal produce while those closer to towns are taking orders via WhatsApp , sources said.

“This lockdown hardly affects villagers as they are the main suppliers of agricultural produce,” John Fernandes , a lawyer from Ambaulim and an organic farmer, said.

As most villagers in the Quepem taluka are agriculturists, they have enough food grains to last them for over a year. They also use raw mango as a pickle and use raw jackfruit in dishes.

In Aldona, vegetables like cluster beans, brinjal, spinach and ivy gourd are available. “This is all freshly picked produce procured directly from the farmers. They’re even priced within the normal range,” said villager Nirmala Fernandes .

After state horticulture outlets downed shutters, Taleigao-based Vito Gomes had about 1,000kg of brinjals from his farm . These were distributed among buyers.

A resident of Dona Paula said he and his neighbours have been able to source sweet potatoes and brinjals from a neighbour.

Nestor Rangel, who has an organic farm in St Estevam, has about 4,000kg of brown rice. He is awaiting his travel and distribution permit to start selling from his farm. “For now, I’m selling the rice from my home in St Cruz to whoever can travel till here. The prices have not been hiked. I don’t take cash and insist on an online transaction to ensure minimal interaction,” he said.

390,['31/03/2020'],Delhi schools become temporary homes,"NEW DELHI: Many of the migrant workers who swarmed Anand Vihar on Saturday to find transport home in defiance of the anti-Covid-19 lockdown have found lodgings in Delhi government schools and night shelters. As many, however, have left Delhi. The 140 migrants or so accommodated in a government school in east Delhi’s Patparganj chafed to return to their villages, worried as they are not only about their own prospects but also relatives fending for themselves in the villages during the national closure.Alarmed by the surging crowd’s potential to spread infection, Delhi government wants to ensure they don’t migrate in such numbers and is, therefore, providing them food and shelter in around 800 centres, including 569 schools and 244 night shelters. Around 12,000 migrant workers and homeless people are staying in these camps. Most are content with the arrangements, but express a wish to reach their hometowns and villages as soon as possible.Social distancing is a way of life at these camps, with the beds placed at appropriate distances and food distribution likewise following a space pattern. Each person has been given a mattress and blanket. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said that the state government had converted 11 more schools into temporary shelters on Monday. “The numbers in the night shelters doubled in the last two days, so we shifted many from the night shelters to government schools,” said Bipin Rai, a DUSIB member.At the school in Patparganj, volunteer Baban Ghosh, an area resident, told TOI, “Thirty-six classrooms are occupied by the migrants, who are not allowed to leave the premises. We were able to provide milk to women who asked for some for their kids.” Inside one classroom, a couple and their two children, aged five and 13, were resting having walked from Nangloi to Anand Vihar. It was a tough walk and Laxmi, 26, even fainted leaving her husband, Aleen Kumar, a construction labour, to resuscitate her. “My head was spinning and I couldn’t walk,” revealed Laxmi. “We were picked up by an ambulance and brought here. We are from Kanpur and we want to go back.”The two kids have made friends with Raja, 23, who shares the classroom with them. Raja hiked from Rajouri Garden and reached the Anand Vihar bus stand by noon and got a bus too, but it was stopped from leaving. “I have three children, wife and parents back in the village. They made a video call on Sunday and were crying to see me walking like this,” Raja said. “Now that I have meals and shelter, I have recorded a video for them. They are happy, but once this is over, home is where I want to be.”Under the railway flyover at east Delhi’s Shakarpur, women and children keep coming towards the road and returning to their temporary halt. “We are seeing if food is being distributed,” explained Geeta Devi. “Daily-wage workers do not have savings. We have been here since morning waiting for food. The problem is it arrives only two times, so we all take turns to check if it has come.”At a night shelter a short distance away are 10 labourers, who share the two bathrooms there. Ashok Chakraborty, 60, who hails from Ballygunge in West Bengal and has been living at the shelter for some days now, told TOI, “I wanted to go home, but the shelter caretaker informed me I might get stuck on the way if I left this place. Here at least, food is not a problem and we get meals twice a day.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74903948,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-259604,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/schools-become-temporary-homes/articleshow/74902321.cms

Bhopal: A day after the Centre decided to stop the massive migration of labourers, the bordering districts of Madhya Pradesh faced a practical problem of identifying space to quarantine thousands of migrants who have already reached the entry points to the state.

Unaware of the fresh orders, the labourers continued to walk or proceed towards their destination in trucks or even atop empty petrol tankers. Many of them who already travelled hundreds of kilometers from Dahod in Gujarat to Morena in Madhya Pradesh on way to Mathura in UP are stuck midway after the MP government order.

Now look at the plight of Jagdish Kumar of Mathura. Heading a group of 17 people of the same family including 15 children, Jagdish had started his journey from Dahod in Gujarat last week.

After he left Dahod, he reached Western MP to take AB road and reach Morena in about 3 days. By the time he reached Morena, he had already covered about 1000 kms and was unaware of the new government order.

“I am a resident of Mathura, but now police have stopped me at this border check post in Morena. They have promised to let me go after two hours. My home is just 140 kms from here”, he said pleading the local journalists to talk to police so that he can proceed further.

Meanwhile, ill-equipped and overworked doctors brave the adverse circumstances. In the absence of mask, many of them wrapped a piece of white cloth around their face to cover nose and face as they screen the migrants.

A top government bureaucrat in Bhopal said, “It’s a huge task. It’s difficult to seal the borders. It’s not a building gate that can be closed down. The number of people reaching from Gujarat in Jhabua and Alirajpur is huge. So is the case in the district of Morena.”

He said that the administration was asked to identify “nearest buildings” to quarantine the migrating population and provide them food.

On Monday morning, arrival of large number of people continued in Morena district. Sarai Chola, a village bordering Rajasthan is the centre of activities.

The district collector Priyanka Das said, “We have identified places to quarantine those who wanted to proceed further from Morena to the districts of UP and MP.”

In the neighbouring Sheopur, district collector Pratibha Pal told TOI, “We have identified tribal hostels which were vacated after the students left for home. We have about 90 people who wanted to go to Jharkhand. But they are lodged at the hostel and we will provide them food and water.”

In the afternoon, a large number of people arrived at Harpalpur , a bordering town of Chhatarpur district. They were travelling from Delhi to Banda and Jhansi districts of Uttar Pradesh. Over 1000 people stuck near Harpalpur before the district authorities talked to their UP counter parts. After the and after their nod, the buses carrying the migrants were allowed to move further.

He added that a 35-year-old Paris-returned man and a 57-year-old woman from Satara district, who were admitted to the Satara district hospital on Saturday as suspected Covid-19 patients, have tested negative.

According to Gadikar, the two positive patients, who are admitted to the isolation ward in Satara, are also responding well to the treatment and are stable. “As a precautionary measure, we have started contacting and collecting swab samples of senior citizens having travel history after March 15,” he said.

Meanwhile, medical education minister Amit Deshmukh, during a press briefing, said the Miraj medical hospital will be turned into a full-fledged coronavirus treatment centre for the district.

“A three-member committee has been formed under the chairmanship of the Mumbai-based JJ Hospital dean Pallavi Saple. She has turned the Miraj hospital into a 300-bed Covid-19 isolation facility. It has 15 intensive care units and other medical facilities. A testing centre for coronavirus infection too will be set up at the hospital in the coming days,” he said.

Hitch hiking, and walking till they got the next ride, the group reached Nagpur, covering 800km in three days, with a similar distance still to go.

When they were first stopped at RBI Square in the afternoon, they refused to go along with Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) officials to a shelter home. However, by evening they had forced to stay at a shelter home.

Aged around 19 and 20, the boys worked for Metrochem company at Vishakapatanam as contract workers. They showed their duty attendance sheets with the address of a book centre at Lekipattanam locality of the city.

A search on the internet shows there is not even a direct train to Karauli, close to the Chambal region in Madhya Pradesh. A road journey from Vizag to Karauli leads through four states before reaching Rajasthan. “The contractor, who is also from our village, left us and is not traceable. When it difficult to sustain any more, we all left,” said Rakam Jatav.

They first boarded an empty truck headed towards Delhi from Vizag but had to get down at the Maharashtra-Telangana border. “At some place called Rajura on the Maharashtra-Telangana border, the police intercepted us. The truck was allowed to go but we were asked to get down. We started our journey again and reached Chandrapur, getting another ride,” he said.

The group said people had been kind to them on the route, with locals giving food and political workers helping them to get a ride. They had walked into the city after being dropped on the outskirts. Like the many other migrant workers, they narrated the same story of running out of money and food.

“We have spent 3 months to a year in Vizag. There are no opportunities back home, and we don’t have any landed property either. Now, we have to rush back as there are aged parents at home,” said 19-year-old Saurabh Gunavat. “We earned Rs12,000 a month and were able to save Rs3,000 to 4,000,” said one of them.

Meanwhile, on almost all the highways, the numbers thinned on Monday though migration continued. TOI again drove on Nagpur-Jabalpur highway to find groups of workers continuing their journey. From groups of 10 to those boarding mini trucks, TOI spotted over 400 workers from Nagpur till around 20km before Mansar.

In the middle of the highway, 15km from Mansar, a group of 20 men were resting under a shade by the side of the road. They were hotel employees at Hyderabad, with one of them employed as a guard in Care Group of hospitals. The group was heading towards Sidhi district of Madhya Pradesh, over 1,091km from Hyderabad.

After facing a crisis, they had called friends in their village, who came to pick them up in three passenger jeeps. On the way back, one of the vehicles rammed into another, leaving it damaged. No one was hurt but the vehicle could not go further. The group is stranded again, as they wait for help.

MP SEALS BORDERS, 1,000 SENT BACK

On Tuesday, the Madhya Pradesh government sealed entry points into the state. Sources at the Khawasa checkpoint on the Nagpur-Jabalpur Highway confirmed the development. They said nearly 1,000 people have been refused entry. Some of them insisted on camping at the border itself. A majority of those at the border only want further passage to UP, said the source.

KOLKATA: The State Fisheries Development Corporation (SFDC) that retails fish from mobile vans in some markets, will reach out to more localities in north and south Kolkata. The decision to augment its retail initiative was taken following complaints of a steep rise in fish price across city markets.

While Rohu and Katla are being sold at Rs 300-Rs 350 per kg in the retail market, SDFC sells these two varities at Rs 160 and Rs 190 per kg, respectively. Though the agency also sells other varieties of fish like bata and mrigel, it is rohu and katla that are in demand now.

SFDC managing director Subrata Mukherjee said around 20 vending vans had been deployed to sell fish in Ballygunge, Tollygunge, Jadavpur, Jodhpur Park, Bhowanipore, Kalighat, Shyambazar and Salt Lake at prices that were much lower than the market price. “Sometimes, we are sending the vans twice, once in the morning and again in the afternoon-evening with replenished stocks,” said Mukherjee.

Since the crisis is also affecting markets beyond Kolkata, SFDC authorities are working on a proposal to extend the retailing of fish to fringe areas as well. Mukherjee also said that the agency’s mobile app was in operation for bulk order of raw fish in specific locations.

Councillors of the Canacona Municipal Council and panchas of various panchayat bodies distributed groceries and other essential items to the people of their respective wards.

At a meeting held on Sunday, Canacona MLA Isidore Fernandes urged the elected representative to ensure that every household gets proper supply of essentials and that supply of medicines is unhindered. He also stressed on the importance of this to ensure that people do not come out of their houses, thus exposing themselves to the risk of contracting coronavirus.

All panchas and councillors have been issued volunteer passes and Fernandes said he has requested the CM to consider Canacona as a special case for passes.

Visakhapatnam: Philanthropic organisations and a few locals have come forward to help the poor in the city and its outskirts during the lockdown. While some are supplying protective gear to health workers, others are providing food and essential commodities to the poor.

Santosh Pulletykurty, founder-president of Ken Foundation Society, supplied 2,000 masks, 2,000 pairs of gloves and 20 litres of sanitiser to the Government Hospital for Chest and Communicable Diseases. “We also received a letter of appreciation from the hospital superintendent for providing protective material to personnel who are testing and treating Covid-19 cases,” he said.

“My friends from the business community and I have made arrangements at a kitchen in MVP Colony to supply food for free, which includes breakfast and lunch, for around 400 people per day. We have also identified a few institutes housing physically-disabled students and old age homes in Tagarapuvalasa, Yendada and Madhurawada and will supply food from March 31.”

Members of Rotary Club Vizag Couples, Richard Borthwick and his wife Supraja, with some team members served food to about 200 stranded passengers and the homeless at Vizag Railway Station. “We also distributed 200 masks made by our son Aaron,” said Supraja.

Adnan Sabuwala, a member of Lion’s Club said they met the deputy collector and handed over 1,000 cloth masks and 60 N95 masks for health and sanitation workers.

399,['31/03/2020'],"Migrants happy to get shelter, but want to go home","Nagpur: A steady stream of migrants kept flowing into the NMC’s shelter homes on Monday as the government clamped down on inter-state travel and ordered officials to move them into the designated camps.

Using its own night shelters and premises of private institutions, the NMC has scaled up its accommodation capacity to 1,262 spread over 15 shelters. While migrants, majority of them being labourers from neighbouring states, were happy to have a roof over their heads and all three square meals a day, the homesickness was evident.

Dinesh Hirbulkar is from Amravati who rues the fact that he’s so close, and yet so far. “I worked at a private firm here but after the lockdown, there was no work. I had to collect some money due to which I stayed back. I received the money but when I reached station, it was announced that trains have been shut down. At this shelter, people are from MP and other states, whereas my home is literally next door and yet I can’t go,” said Hirbulkar, who has been put up at the shelter home in Indora.

Sheshrao Umbre from Mandla said he lies to his mother about everything being normal here. “I called and told her that I am still at the construction site, and though work has stopped, they are allowing us to stay there and are also feeding us,” said Umbre.

He is happy with the facilities but says is eagerly waiting for the lockdown to end so that he can go home. “I rue the fact that we started for home so late due to financial issues. Two more weeks is a very long time to stay in one location. I want the government to do medical tests on us and then allow us to travel to MP,” he added.

Prashant Uikey, supervisor of a shelter home at Indora, said, “We have have almost 40 people here in two separate buildings. Enough distance is being maintained and they all are being provided all meals and medical attention.”

At the NMC school near Raj Bhavan at Sadar, Pravesh Sharma begs to be released. Sharma worked in a granite factory in Bengaluru. Twelve of them and a child started off on six motorcycles from Bangalore to Gwalior. At Nagpur, they were apprehended by the police. The bikes were taken to Dhantoli police station and the group was sent to the school which now is a shelter room for migrant labourers and footpath dwellers.

“Can something be done,” asks Nawal Singh from the same group. He also admits that their condition was not like many other daily wagers. “They have been living in Bangalore since 12 years and were not migratory workers exactly. We could have easily pulled on during the lockdown, but then there was panic everywhere, so we left too. As the children’s schools were closed, we took it as an opportunity to visit our home town as well, but now are held up here,” said Singh.

At the school that had 55 occupants, the migratory workers felt like caged birds and wanted to be allowed to continue their journey further.

“I have developed cramps in the legs walking all the way, but it was all in vain after I was caught by the police and put up here,” says Shyam Maraskole, a construction worker. Maraskole said he walked down from Nashik with three others. “My children are anxiously waiting. I could have easily reached home in Seoni district,” he says. Seoni is around 100km form Nagpur.

“They can carry out our check up and let us go. We will again get ourselves examined in our villages,” said Suksen, also from Seoni. “We are all put up in a single room. This will only increase the changes of infection,” said Tamsingh in his twenties as leftover food could be seen lying in dustbin right in front of the rooms.

PANAJI: Efforts to repatriate tourists stranded in Goa have picked up pace as authorities have lined up at least six rescue flights to evacuate approximately 1,600 foreign nationals by April 4.

The German government with support from the Union ministry of external affairs has organised three rescue flights out of Goa International Airport from Tuesday. The flights, operated by Air India, will include not just German nationals, but citizens of other EU nations too, said sources.

The first flight will depart from Dabolim at 5.15am on Tuesday for Mumbai and then head directly to Frankfurt. On April 1 and 2, similar flights will depart at 11am to Mumbai and then Frankfurt.

“The document verification process has already begun, the passengers have been provided food. Most passengers are German, but the flight is loading a lot of EU passengers,” a source in the German embassy said.

Officials with Airports Authority of India also confirmed that the Finnish airline, Finnair, will be operating a relief flight on April 1 and that an aircraft from Poland could also be deployed to pick up stranded EU citizens on April 4.

Airport officials said Israel operated a special rescue flight to take its citizens stranded in the state through Arkia on Monday night.

“Our efforts are on to ensure that stranded foreign nationals return to their homes. We are working with all foreign embassies. Already three relief flights have taken off from Goa. In the coming days there will be three Air India flights in which at least 900 Germans will be leaving. One Finnair flight will fly to Helsinki after that,” Goa airport director Gagan Malik said.

Officials estimate that there are around 2,000 foreign nationals stuck due to the lockdown in Goa. “Social distancing will be maintained all through the process and we will also ensure that they are seated apart while sitting at the airport. We are trying to give as much relief,” Malik said.

The relief flights for German nationals sparked envy among the British tourists who remain stranded in Goa. “Germans putting UK to shame,” said Derbyshire resident Hazel Holiday.

“At the end of our lane in Colomb Bay we have just seen a group of German citizens being picked up by mini bus to take them to a coach in Palolem for airport transfer. They received individual emails from their government with everything planned for them. Well done Germany- UK still nothing!” she said in a public post on Facebook .

Since they have to deal with many customers in a day, they stand a higher chance of getting infected by coronavirus . Moreover, the nationwide lockdown has made commodity procurement difficult.Procuring the products from wholesale markets and ensuring that people get access to essential commodities amid lockdown is not easy. However, the traders are doing their bit to ensure residents get what they need at the local stores and sometimes even at their doorstep.Sangita Shirse and Pratik Shirse of Sandeep Provisions in Cidco N-3 said that they were trying to ensure that they have all the essential commodities so that citizens could get whatever they need under one roof. They are even facilitating doorstep delivery of groceries but are facing issues in procuring the essentials.“Due to difficulty in movement of goods, there is a shortage of supply at Old Mondha. We need to procure essential household products to keep up with the demand,” said Sangita.Owner of Dhiraj Provisions in Cidco N-5 is worried about infection spread. “We come in contact with hundreds of people everyday. You can’t tell who is infected,” said the owner.Some shopkeepers have placed a table infront of the counter to ensure 1 metre gap from the customers. Boards put up in shops asking people to cover their faces and stand on the markings to ensure social distancing is of little help, especially during sudden rush in the evening.According to Jadhav of Savji Bhaji market, the rush at the vegetable wholesale market in Jadhavwadi is concerning. “We follow the norms to avoid infection but there is no alternative to procurement of fresh produce for vendors like me. If the fruit and vegetable markets can be separated or different days are designated for their sale, the rush of customers can be reduced,” said Jadhav.Jagannath Kale, president of Aurangabad Jilla Vyapari Mahasangh, said that traders have held meetings with district supply officer (DSO) Mahadeo Kirwale ensuring that there would no shortage in supply of essential commodities. “We are seeing to it that commodities like oil, rice, wheat and sugar which are procured from other cities have a smooth supply.”“We are coordinating with the local suppliers . Even the Aurangabad DSO is coordinating with his contemporaries in other districts to ensure that the trucks carrying these commodities are not stopped,” said Kale.Suggestions were also being made to use the extra space available at Jadhavwadi market for vendors to sit away from one another to avoid rush, he said.Meanwhile, with the salary day of most citizens drawing nearer, the district-level trader association has appealed to people not to engage in panic buying. “They can buy the essentials needed for a month.

Nagpur: Even as lakhs of construction workers in the country are desperately trying to go back to their villages as they are unable to buy food items, MahaMetro ’s construction workers are getting free food and shelter . Not only this, the workers are being regularly checked for coronavirus by doctors engaged by its contractors.

A MahaMetro spokesperson said that about 2,900 workers, who were unable to go back to their homes, are being taken care of in their labour camps. TOI visited one such camp at Nagalwadi (near Hingna) and talked to the workers. They said that they were getting sufficient food.

The Nagalwadi camp, housing 300 labourers, belongs to MahaMetro contractor Afcons. Gaurav Tripathi, an Afcons employee, said that a doctor from Lata Mangeshkar Hospital comes to the camp office near the camp and checks the workers for coronavirus symptoms. An ambulance is also available for ready use.

“We have set up two isolation rooms so that if somebody has cough and cold, he is kept there away from others. As soon as it is possible, we will shift the patient to government hospitals,” said Tripathi.

Lav Kush Kumar, a labourer from Uttar Pradesh, said that while he was getting food, he would prefer to go home. “There is nothing to do the whole day. Boredom is a big problem,” he told TOI. Naresh Mandal, a worker from West Bengal, said the same thing. Both the workers said that they were tested by the doctor every three to four days. Most of the workers in Nagalwadi camp are from UP, WB, Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha.

A MahaMetro spokesperson said that about 5,500 construction workers were employed in Nagpur Metro project in the first week of March. “Hundreds went to their native villages for Holi and did not return till the lockdown was announced. Some 600 workers were from nearby districts and went home before the lockdown. Now, there are 2,871 workers in 40 camps,” he said.

He further said that all the camps and offices were fumigated and disinfected frequently. “The workmen are being educated about the importance of social distancing. Masks , gloves etc., have been distributed and are available in adequate stock. Twelve thermal scanners are available and workmen are randomly tested for high temperatures,” he said.

“A safety team comprising 20 professionals and their team are on emergency duty. Senior officials visit worksites regularly and ensure that the actions are effective. Detailed emergency preparedness and response guidelines have been prepared and implemented. Psychological counselling is being offered to workers to ensure that they stay in proper frame of mind,” said the spokesperson.

He added that eight doctors were taking care of the workers full time or part time. The number of male nurses employed by MahaMetro is eleven.

However, for the administration a major challenge awaits as due to the total lockdown, these inmates would have to be dropped home by police.

The decision to release these inmates was taken by a state-level committee comprising the Madhya Pradesh high court Chief Justice, principal secretary and director general (jails). The panel had decided that undertrials and convicts who are lodged in jails for crimes having conviction of less than five years were to be released. These measures came following a Supreme Court order on March 23 that directed all states and Union Territories to set up high-level committees which would look into the release of convicts on parole who have been in jail for up to seven years, in order to decongest jails amid the threat of Covid-19.

DG (prisons) Madhya Pradesh Sanjay Chawdhary said, “We have already taken several measures such as setting up of isolation barracks to contain the spread of Covid-19 in jails. Releasing these inmates will be of great help as it will reduce crowding in jails. As far as sending them home is concerned, it has been decided that the inmates would sent to their respective districts by police in their vehicles. They would first report at the jail of their respective district and would then be dropped home”.

Sources said that when the decision to release inmates was made, their transport was the biggest concern as the entire state is in lockdown. Subsequently, it was decided that police would drop these inmates home. However, given the emergency duties bestowed upon police during lockdown, this would also be difficult, and is likely to take time as well, added sources.

Superintendent Bhopal central jail, Dinesh Nargawe said, “Around 147 inmates who were under trials were already released, others would also be released on interim bail soon. Even convicts are being released on parole of 60 days. Between 1,000 and 1,200 inmates would be released from Bhopal central jail”. Sources said that some of the inmates at Bhopal jail who are eligible for release are from far away districts like Balaghat; transporting them to their homes would be a herculean task for police.

In case there is another extension to the lockdown, Shirke said the university will work on other plans for first and second-year undergraduate course exams. It will be put the plan before the academic council members and only after the council’s nod, it could be worked out. Shirke, however, refrained from giving more details.

Due to the changes in the current schedule, entrance exams for various courses will also be affected.

Shirke said unless the final-year undergraduate semester exams conclude, the entrance exams will not be conducted.

“It is unfortunate that the youths from different parts of the district are stepping out of their homes just to have the feel of things in violation of lockdown,” Jaleel told TOI.

He visited several areas and appealed the masses to stay indoors from the public announcement system installed in the civic body car. He even appealed the head of families as well as elderly people to take responsibility of not letting the youths out of their homes without any valid reason.

Sources in the civic body informed that the MP has been asked to continue with his appeal by stepping on the streets for the next few days.

The idea to rope in Jaleel to convince the masses was considered by district collector Uday Choudhary and civic body chief Astik Kumar Pandey. The police brought it to their notice that using force and registration of offences against offenders has failed to put a check on people venturing out. Instead, it has added to friction between the masses and the police.

A senior police officer said, “The police, administration, government and masses need to be on the same page for fighting the pandemic. However, some mischievous elements from different parts of the city continued to venture out and create a problem for law enforcement agencies.”

The city police have already started registering offences against those stepping out even without face masks, as well as those violating social distancing norms while buying groceries in the markets.

She and her daughter are since stuck in Nagpur.

Vishakha said Alia was suffering from a heart ailment since birth. A local doctor advised her to take Alia to GMCH Nagpur. They were in Nagpur when suddenly a complete lockdown was announced and all transport services were shut. “We got stuck at the hospital. Yesterday, we were brought by the authorities to the shelter camp at Tuli College of Hotel Management on Bokhara Road near Koradi octroi post Nagpur,” Vishakha said.

Vishakha is also five months pregnant for the second time. Her Husband who works in Hyderabad is stuck there due to the lockdown, said Neerja Pathania, an event management professional who along with her friend Neha Patel, an entrepreneur, and a few others are managing this shelter camp as a social responsibility.

Neerja said that it was a risk for people like Vishakha to stay in such camps without a doctor. She said they were trying for a doctor as a daily check up is must of people staying in the camp, specially of someone like Vishakha.

Vishakha said if she had known things were going to take such a turn she wouldn’t have come to Nagpur.

“Though those running the camp are counseling us and taking good care of me and my daughter by providing us with mask, food and stay at this camp but I still want to go back to my home as my in-laws are waiting for us,” Vishakha said.

Avinash Lavania, who is the son-in-law of senior BJP leader Narottam Mishra, could replace Tarun Pithode as Bhopal collector.

Besides, the government would also change the Gwalior collector after the erstwhile Nath government had replaced Anurag Choudhary with Kaushlendra Vikram Singh as the new Gwalior collector earlier this month. According to sources, Choudhary would be given charge of a big district and may be even send back to Gwalior.

Jabalpur collector Bharat Yadav, who had ordered the closure of an iron ore mine owned by BJP MLA Sanjay Pathak earlier this month, is also expected to be removed. Officials had said the Jabalpur district administration, where the mine is located, ordered the closure of the mine for allegedly violating a Supreme Court ruling.

On Saturday, the state government transferred Indore collector Lokesh Kumar Jatav and made DIG Manish Singh the new collector. Harinarayanchari Mishra was appointed as DIG.

Earlier, Rajgarh collector, Nidhi Nivedita who had allegedly assaulted a BJP leader during a pro-Citizenship Amendment Act rally on January 20, was transferred on March 24, a day after Shivraj Singh Chouhan took oath as CM for the fourth time.

Soon after taking over as CM, Chouhan changed chief secretary and appointed Iqbal Singh Bains as CS. Kamal Nath government on March 17 had appointed M Gopal Reddy as chief secretary, but was removed within a week after BJP came to power in state.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state police have ruled out interference of any extremist forces in the sudden mobilization and protest by guest labourers at Paippad near Changanassery But, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan smelt a conspiracy behind the agitation. While speaking to reporters here on Monday, Vijayan said the police have started to probe the conspiracy and already three persons have been arrested.“This is an attempt to jeopardise the good works the state has done in controlling the spreading of the virus. As per the directives issued by the prime minister, the state government has done everything to take care of the needs of the migrant labourers,” said Vijayan.Police and intelligence agencies have reached a conclusion that the main reason behind the sudden grouping of labourers from northern states was mainly triggered by the video clippings of thousands of labourers thronging the interstate bus terminal at Anand Vihar in New Delhi, where the Uttar Pradesh government had arranged buses to ferry them to their hometowns.“These clippings and the news was widely circulated in the social media groups containing labourers from Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal, etc. in the state. This triggered a hope that they will be provided with some kind of transport facility to return to their native states,” sources said.Also, in a discussion held by the local tahsildar with the representatives of labourers, contractors and the house owners, all kinds of basic facilities were assured to them, but the contractors were willing to send them back as they are also running into crisis with their work being stalled, sources added. At the same time, many of the house owners were willing to accommodate them without rent.“Most of the labourers were hardly left with any money as they send them to their homes on a daily or weekly basis. Also, with the beverage outlets and other pan shops shut down and the regulations in the state being tough in these matters, the labourers who are used to such habits suddenly found it hard to adjust,” sources added.State police chief Loknath Behera had said an assistant nodal officer will be appointed by the police, and all the details relating to the migrant labourers- including their activities, health and comfort- should be sent by district police chiefs to ADGP (law and order) and ADGP (intelligence) on a day-to-day basis.A man from West Bengal was taken into custody in connection with the public protest held by guest workers at Paippad in Kottayam district on Sunday. Police have examined the call list of the guest worker, Mohammad Rinju. They found that he had contacted several workers as well as some media persons through this phone ahead of the protest. Police are probing whether some other forces are behind him.A special investigation team was formed to probe the conspiracy angle.Food minister P Thilothaman convened a meeting at Paippad on Monday to ensure the welfare of the guest workers.

414,['31/03/2020'],"Scribe, cop accuse each other of assault after lathi charge","Aurangabad: There have been allegations and counter-allegations of assault against the Hingoli police as well as a journalist and his associates following a lathi-charge incident in the town’s Gandhi Chowk area on Sunday afternoon. Both the journalist and an assistant police inspector were admitted to a hospital in Hingoli.

While one group claims the Hingoli traffic police personnel had assaulted a TV journalist who was filming them while they were lathi charging people roaming around the city, the police counter it by saying that the journalist and his associates had instead attacked and injured a police officer and had stopped a public servant from performing his duty.

A couple of days ago, the same journalist had reported on the unhygienic way the traffic policemen were distributing masks, which allegedly angered the policemen. However, the police said that the journalist picked up a quarrel with the cops and assaulted a police officer.

Based on API Omkant Chincholkar statement, journalist Krushna Khandelwal and five others have been booked on the charges of using criminal force to deter a public servant from performing his duty, unlawful assembly, rioting, disobeying orders duly promulgated by the authorities. Relevant sections of the National Disaster Management Act have also been slapped.

Hingoli SP Yogesh Kumar told TOI, “Based on the complaint lodged by the police officer, we have registered a case against the scribe and five people who accompanied him. Yesterday, we had sent a team to record the journalist, but could not do so. Today (Monday) we are sending our team to record his statement again. After that appropriate action would be taken.”

Chincholkar too released a video and claimed that the journalist was upset after the police had caught some youths from his locality while moving around in violation of the lockdown. This led to heated arguments, following which Khandelwal, and five others, allegedly attacked the cops and Chincholkar suffered a head injury.

Following the incident, especially after the police gave priority to registering an offence against Khandelwal, local journalists expressed their concerns over the possibility of an impartial probe. Several journalists’ associations, including those in Mumbai, condemned the incident and demanded action against the alleged police high-handedness.

Earlier this week, the Hingoli police faced criticism after a woman assistant police inspector allegedly assaulted a health assistant on duty for Covid-19 survey and her father, a serving head constable. The incident left the health assistant with five stitches on her head.

Apart from arranging the essentials needed by the students, Patil also sent a police team and ensured that calls were made to the students’ families. The family members were assured of the students’ safety.

To ensure that the students, all of them teenagers, do not get bored during the lockdown, cricket kits and footballs were gifted to them with instructions to the madrassa management to let the students play within the compound.

Patil told TOI: “The students hail from a far-off state and it is obvious for the children and their parents to worry about each other. We have not only assured the families of the students’ safety but have also shared our direct contact numbers — so that they can contact us for any help or assistance.”

It all started after a nation-wide lockdown was announced. The students wanted to return home. Their parents too were worried and were making calls to the madrassa management. When API Mahesh Andhale got to know of this, he informed the superintendent of police, who took a personal interest in addressing the issue.

A police team led API Andhale reached out to the madrassa and even briefed the students on the precautions, including social distancing, to be taken during the coronavirus outbreak.

In addition, 60 migrant families, including several children, who had left Bhalgaon to return to their home-towns in other states, got stuck in the city. On learning about it, the Chikalthana police not only arranged for dry ration for them but also gifted the kids with cricket kits and footballs.

KOLKATA: A 29-year-old homemaker in Behala was arrested on Monday for sending a false message on a kindergarten school guardians’ group about multiple Covid-19 cases being detected in New Alipore area.

This is the second such arrest in the city during the lockdown, the first being that of a woman who had spread rumours that a Beliaghata ID Hospital doctor had been detected with Covid-19. The CID and Bengal police also arrested two persons—one in Siliguri and another at Memari in Burdwan—for spreading fake novel coronavirus news over the past 48 hours, taking the total arrests in Bengal to 15 so far.

“No one can spread rumours. In her post, the woman claimed New Alipore has 15 novel coronavirus cases in New Alipore’s Block P. It raised alarm among locals,” said an officer. Police has slapped IPC section 505 (1) (b) on the accused, Pallavi Shivani, a resident of Jyotish Roy Road in Behala. Shivani’s husband is a businessman.

“We learnt on Sunday that a woman had posted rumours that New Alipore area had at least 15 Covid-19 cases and the state was trying to suppress it (though the messages shared by police with media makes no mention of the government). The woman’s user name has the name of a playschool chain. We contacted the authorities but we found no one called ‘Pallavi’ worked there. We contacted some of the parents and one of them identified the sender. We arrested her from her home. She could not show ant explanation in support of her information,” said an officer. “She was produced in court on Monday.” After her arrest, the woman broke down.

“I have made a big mistake, please let me go,” she pleaded before the cops. She promised to send a mass apology and later, her mobile was taken away.

Kolkata Police is set to question 100 people under CrPC 41 for sharing and sending fake messages, most of which turned out to be that of incidents from outside the state. “If we find ulterior motives, we will make arrests,” said a cyber cell officer.

The civic body has also directed Government Medical College and Hospital to disinfect and seal ward no. 36.

One of the five positive patients of Covid-19 from the same family at Jaripatka had a paralytic attack and was admitted to the ICU at Janata Hospital. Then, he was taken for a medical test at Panorama Centre. Later, he was admitted in ward no. 36 of GMCH. The 14th positive patient, a resident of a housing society near Gandhisagar Lake, too had a test at Rainbow Medinova Centre. These developments resulted in the closure of all these places.

Swab samples of around 26, which include doctors, nurses, a pathologist and others from Janata, eight GMCH doctors and four paramedical staff and a couple of staff members from the MRI centres, were taken before they were quarantined. Most of the suspects were isolated at the GMCH wards where shortage of rooms for suspects too was reported on Monday.

NMC’s additional medical officer (health) Dr Praveen Gantawar said there was no patient admitted at the Janata Hospital before it was sealed.

The patient who had a paralytic attack belongs to the Jaripatka family where four more members have tested positive. His 33-year-old younger brother was the first to test positive on March 28, becoming the 10th Covid-19 patient of city. On March 29, the paralysed man and the 10th patient’s 12-year-old daughter tested positive. On Monday, the ailing patient’s 44-year-old wife and 14-year-old son also tested positive.

On March 30, TOI was the only paper to report about large-scale exposure at Janata Hospital and GMCH as the family had not disclosed the 33-year-old man who worked at the shop of Khamla businessman was a Covid-19 suspect at the time. He was reportedly handled without safety kits.

Dr Gantawar said an ambulance was deployed outside Janata hospital for needy patients. “I will inspect GMCH general ward where the patient was initially admitted. After we informed them that his brother tested positive, the patient was shifted to GMCH’s Covid-19 ward on Saturday,” he said.

The medical officer said the man was admitted at Janata from March 26 evening to 4pm on March 27. “On March 26 night, he was taken for MRI at Panorama in Shankar Nagar where it was confirmed he had brain haemeorrage. Then, he was shifted to GMCH,” said Dr Gantawar.

At Janata Hospital, the man had reported to the casualty section. “After the ECG, he was shifted to ICU. The corridor too was contaminated. The nurse who attended him may have touched others,” said Dr Gantawar.

On Rainbow Medinova Centre being sealed, Dr Gantawar said, “The 14th patient had visited it. We don't want to leave a single area open from where the virus can spread,” he said.

NMC chief medical officer Dr Yogendra Savai and Gantawar led the NMC team in the sealing action.

Before sealing, an NMC team led by deputy commissioner Dr Pradeep Dasarwar disinfected the entire Janata Hospital and the two centres.

The NMC is also checking how many patients came for diagnosis at these two centres from the date when the two positive patients were brought for tests.

Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar confirmed that the GMCH doctors and paramedical staff were quarantined.

In the morning, NMC health officials informed that eight suspects were diverted from GMCH to IGGMCH. Officials said the suspects have to stay back due to which rooms were occupied. “Once the results come, the suspects would be shifted to MLA hostel and others brought in,” they said.

NEW DELHI: The Anand Vihar area, which saw scores of migrant workers descending on the interstate bus terminus and the Kaushambi bus depot on the other side of the road on Saturday and Sunday, was eerily desolate on Monday. A strict clampdown was imposed not only on all roads leading to Anand Vihar but also at all border areas of Delhi.

From Saturday night to Sunday, more than 30,000 migrant workers who reached the area despite fervent appeals from chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to stay back in Delhi were transported to nearby areas in Uttar Pradesh, from where they could get buses to their villages.

On Monday, only security personnel and multiple layers of barricades could be seen in the area with both the ISBT and the Kaushambi depot sealed. “It will be ensured that no crowding takes place at Delhi’s borders with UP and Haryana,” a Delhi government official said.

From Monday, the government has ensured stringent checking of those boarding Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and Cluster scheme buses and only those involved in essential services and carrying curfew passes are being allowed to board. “Drivers and conductors have been told that they will face action if there’s any violation,” he said.

Just 50% of Delhi’s bus fleet has been deployed to ferry those involved in essential services. Routes have been rationalised keeping in mind the workplaces of essential service providers and their residential areas. Many hospitals have also hired DTC buses to ferry their staff.

Police suspect that the burglary is a result of serious constraint in the supply of liquor, and the possibility of liquor addicts committing the crime cannot be ruled out. The central government declared a country-wide shutdown till April 14 in wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Those being caught with liquor are being booked under various sections.

About 22 liquor boxes have been stolen and authorities suspect that at least a pickup van must have been used for carrying the liquor. On learning about the incident, the Waluj police followed by the crime branch team rushed to the spot. The spot panchanama revealed that the suspects walked away only with the boxes containing different kinds of liquor, and did not touch the boxes containing beer bottles.

Police have found that the suspects took extra precautions to not to leave behind any clue as they even walked away with the DVR as well as the inverter.

This drug was used for treating Hepatitis C. We can do a trial and find if it is useful in severe cases. Even then we need to formulate a trial protocol and finalize when it can be used,” he said.Dr R R Gangakhedkar, who heads epidemiology and communicable diseases at ICMR, said the drug is mainly used to control cytokine storm, which is caused by an overreaction of the immune system to an infection. “It has been used in multiple diseases when it comes to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. China used it widely. It doesn’t mean that it works alone, this is just a symptomatic treatment. If you have cytokine storm we use interferon alpha,” he said.Covid-19 can be fatal when it triggers an overreaction of body’s immune system which is called cytokine storm. Cytokines are meant to regulate body's response against an infection, however in some cases it results in an overdrive. When coronavirus enters the lungs, it drives immune cells to combat the virus. However, excessive production of cytokines results in hyper-inflammation which could be potentially fatal to the patient. Cytokine storm is a common complication of respiratory diseases caused by coronaviruses.A study by Chinese researchers on clinical predictors of mortality due to Covid-19 by analysing data of 150 patients from Wuhan, published in Springer journal in March, said the predictors of a fatal outcome included age, presence of underlying diseases, secondary infection and elevated inflammatory indicators in blood. It also suggests that the mortality might be due to virus-activated ‘cytokine storm syndrome’ or fulminant myocarditis.Kerala plans to try this drug on patients under clinical category C, which includes breathlessness, chest pain, drowsiness, fall in blood pressure and conditions denoted as red flag signs along with worsening of underlying chronic conditions. “A major concern for us is that 21% of state’s population have co-morbidities and they are vulnerable and in extreme cases we could try this drug,” said Ekbal.The disease management guideline prepared by Kerala for Covid-19 said the treatment includes general supportive measures under full infection control protocols and it will conform to management of respiratory involvement according to severity, other bacterial co-infection etc and other multi-organ support (as and when indicated).",thiruvananthapuram,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cuban-wonder-drug-to-be-tried-only-in-extreme-cases/articleshow/74900791.cms

Since curfew has been slapped in the area following a Covid-19 positive case, those who are helping them with food and water are finding it difficult to feed them. Rafiq Qadri, a volunteer who is providing food to over 1,400 pilgrims, said it has been a week since they are providing food due to generous donations from people. “It will be really difficult to run the programme for long. After some days, we have to focus on the local poor families and with limited resources, we won’t be able to feed both the sections,” said Qadri.

These pilgrims came a few days before the lockdown and got stuck due to cancellation of trains and bus services.

Most of these pilgrims have vacated the hotels and are staying at the free space provided by locals. They are living in small rooms with 8-10 members in a room.

“I have come with 40 members, including children and women. Without proper arrangements, we cannot travel. I have appealed to our CM K Chandrashekar Rao to help us return to our home state,” said Hafiz Ur Rehman , a devotee from Hyderabad.

JAIPUR: To provide food for the animals and birds amid lockdown , the Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) has started an initiative along with the Akshay Patra Foundation.

Everyday JMC is serving 8,000 chapatis to dogs all over the city. Recently, JMC bought 50 new hoopers in which a helper has been provided with the duty to distribute chapatis to dogs in the city.

An official at JMC said, “We have been receiving calls at call centres regarding street dogs not getting food due to lockdown. Hence, JMC has decided to spend money to feed the animals. Similarly, there are many spots in city where pigeons are being fed by the passers-by daily. We have purchased about eight quintals of seeds to be fed to the pigeons.”

People used to feed pigeons at various spots like Ramniwas Bagh, Albert Hall , Hawa Mahal, etc. however, with the lockdown the entire state machinery has come to a standstill which has affected not just human beings but also animals.

Commissioner V P Singh has ordered a cement tank to be kept in every park to provide water to animals and birds. “I request the public to make two extra chapatis at home for the dogs and feed birds on their terraces. This is a time of crisis so we want people to co-operate with each other,” said Singh.

The lockdown had an adverse effect on the migrants and daily wagers the most. People have been out of jobs and are not able to arrange two meals. With Akshay Patra, JMC has started distributing more than one lakh food packets in the city. Special vans of Akshay Patra are distributing these packets.

424,['31/03/2020'],"Now, district administration stresses on room quarantine","Thiruvananthapuram: The district administration is mulling stressing on room quarantine instead of home quarantine with the latest instance of home quarantine norms being compromised in the district.

The seven-year-old daughter of a person who has been tested positive has been hospitalized after she developed symptoms. The person arrived from Dubai and was advised to go on home quarantine. He stayed at home for five days and according to authorities the norms were compromised which may have exposed his family members.

This is the second case in the district when home quarantine was reported to be compromised. The person who came from Britain to the city and was tested positive had compromised on home quarantine which made district collector K Gopalakrishnan to repeatedly insist on the need to stick with the norms.

The district administration is also making the families choose a single member to take care of the person under home quarantine rather than random family members interacting with the person. The ministry of health and family welfare has recently brought out guidelines on home quarantine in which instructions for the family members of persons being home quarantined are clearly laid out. It says that only an assigned family member should be tasked with taking care of the person under quarantine.

Even within the room, strict guidelines have been issued. The quarantined person has to stay away from elderly people, pregnant women, children and persons with co-morbidities within the household.

Besides the movement has to be restricted and under no circumstances shall the person attend any social/religious gathering like wedding, condolence meet, etc.

The patient who is under treatment at Medical College isolation ward is learnt not to have complied with restrictions in movement within the house which may have resulted in his daughter developing symptoms.

In the first case, although the person didn't come out of house, he got in close proximity with family members like his wife, his wife's sister, brother in law, father in law. They shared same phone, ate together and shared common areas which was unadvisable, the collector had said.

He had said that those from all foreign countries should go to home quarantine for 28 days and it should be real home quarantine, They shall not come out during this period, use single toilet, single room and door shall not be kept open.This is very important, the authorities had pointed out.

As per the Union ministry guidelines, the assigned member of the family should avoid shaking the soiled linen or direct contact with skin. Disposable gloves have to be used when cleaning the surfaces or handling soiled linen.

In case the person being quarantined becomes symptomatic, all the close contacts will be home quarantined (for 14 days) and followed up for an additional 14 days or till the report of such case turns out negative on lab testing.

425,['31/03/2020'],Crowd control at markets a tough task for authorities,"Overcrowded vegetable markets have become a major problem for the district authorities in maintaining the social distancing norms since the beginning of the nation-wide lockdown. As part of tackling the situation, the authorities have come up with a slew of ideas.

The district administration was forced to shut down the central vegetable market within a few hours after opening for business on the first day of the lockdown. Even police could not control the mad rush. The authorities have reduced the business hours, in vain.

Markings on the ground were introduced to keep safe distance between shoppers. But, people ignored the norms when it was announced that the market would be closed at 9am. Pandi, a vendor, said that people just rushed in during the closure time desperately to buy vegetables.

P S Murugan, president, Mattuthavani Vegetable Market Association, said that they had witnessed big crowd during weekdays. ""It was only on Sundays that we saw such large crowds,"" he said.

Corporation commissioner S Visakan says that people should minimize their visits to the market at a crisis period. The corporation has the main markets and spread them out on empty roads. This has helped in controlling the crowds to some extent, but the response from the vendors was lukewarm as they had to move to new locations as the shops were spread out in the four zones. Now the corporation is using 100 of its LMV vehicles to distribute vegetables in each of the 100 wards.

Theni district administration has come up with a better solution. On the instructions from district collector Pallavi M Baldev bags of assorted vegetable were distributed. The bag priced at Rs 150, has around 18 vegetables. Sources said that they had arranged 50 such bags on Sunday that are sold out in one hour. From Tuesday they have planned to double the number of bags.

426,['31/03/2020'],Demand to promote varsity students,"Aurangabad: As the academic time table of state universities has gone haywire due to the Covid-19 outbreak, demand is being raised to promote university students on the line of schoolchildren.

Advocacy group Marathwada Association for Students Aurangabad (MASA) has submitted a memorandum in this effect to Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, who is the ex-officio Chancellor of the state universities.

MASA president Ulhas Udhan said that conducting examination for students pursuing higher education would be a herculean task, which he said will consume lot of time. “The conduct of examination requires a period of a minimum of two months. Once the lockdown is over and the next academic session beings, a lot of time will be wasted in carrying out examinations. It will result in collapsing of the next academic session as well,” he said.

Udhan said the student community at large was under mental stress due to uncertainty over examinations. The state universities, including Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University (BAMU) and Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University (SRTMU), Nanded have indefinitely postponed their examinations amid the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic.

“The student community has been only guessing about possible dates of examinations. The uncertainty over examinations is naturally adding to their stress level. Also, four lakh students giving examinations post lockdown is not advisable as nobody knows to what extent the social distancing norm would be applicable post lockdown,” Udhan said.

Visakhapatnam: The Visakhapatnam city and district police have registered around 1,400 cases in the past eight days in relation to the lockdown violation and collected Rs 67 lakh in fine for traffic violations.

The city police in the last nine days took 726 persons into custody, filed 381 cases against people for violating the lockdown and impounded 565 vehicles. They also registered 21,891 cases and collected Rs 53 lakh in fine for MV Act violations. Meanwhile, Visakha rural police registered 905 cases against lockdown-breachers, including 372 shops, and seized 508 vehicles. They registered 3,315 cases and imposed Rs 14 lakh as fine for traffic violations.

But commuters have accused the police of being over-zealous. “We can understand that many youths are violating the lockdown and roaming the roads. But cops are threatening even those who are out buying essential commodities,” said a commuter.

When TOI spoke to traffic cops, they pointed out that the lockdown cannot be an excuse for not wearing helmets and seat belts. “Traffic rules have not been relaxed,” said a traffic cop, pointing out that he found many have been citing excuses that they “forgot to wear a helmet or seat belt because they are in a hurry”.

“ The government has given relaxation to buy essential commodities. But few people are roaming the roads just for fun,” Visakha rural SP Babujee Attada said.

However, over the past few days, the police realised that people were still unnecessarily coming out on the roads citing different — often non-essential — reasons. We also noticed that people were crowding the vegetable markets, which was not the case before the lockdown. This was completely going against the spirit and purpose of the lockdown. That is why we have increased the policing activity to keep a check on various roads and take action against the violators. We have decided to completely lock down the town from Monday and no one would be allowed to come out on road for any reason. On Monday, we have received a good response. We expect people to support us over the next two days as well.”“We have, however, exempted essential services like banking, hospitals and medical stores from the complete lockdown.

435,['31/03/2020'],"With no ration cards, migrants struggle to make ends meet","Aurangabad: Jaya Thorat, a resident of Harsul and mother of four children, is struggling to make ends meet owing to the lockdown.

“My husband is a daily wager and used to load goods in trucks before the lockdown was announced by the state government around 10 days ago. We do not have sufficient food to eat,” she said, adding that they hail from Pachora in neighbouring Jalgaon district and do not have a ration card.

Sumita Mhaske is another resident going through the same ordeal. “We hail from Jalna district and moved to Aurangabad in search of livelihood around five years ago. We heard that the government is providing essential food items through ration shops, but we do not have a ration card,” she said.

A considerable number of migrant population from neighbouring districts and living on the city outskirts is struggling for food amid current lockdown due to lack of ration card. Many of these families were seen roaming on the streets every day with a hope of getting some help.

Economist HM Desarda said the number of poor families that do not have ration card could be huge and the government should reach out to them during the ongoing crisis.

“Aurangabad has huge population of unorganized sector workers who have migrated from neighbouring districts as well different parts of the region in search of jobs. Many of them do not have ration card or other essential documents as they are not aware of its importance. Such population was engaged in menial jobs, but lost employment due to Covid-19 outbreak,” he said.

Aurangabad has industrial areas at Waluj, Chikalthana and Shendra providing jobs to migrant workers. The lockdown in the industrial sector has also posed survival issues before this workforce.

Desarda said affected families must be supplied with cooked food instead of providing grains.

When contacted, Aurangabad divisional deputy commissioner Varsha Thakur-Ghuge said the district-level authorities have been asked to extend all possible help to the affected migrant families at the earliest.

“Even if the migrant families do not have ation cards, they will receive grains and other essentials. The government authorities are on their toes to reach out to all those who are starving during the current crisis,” she said.

437,['31/03/2020'],Volunteers help the elderly by delivering essentials home,"Help at hand

Bhopal: A group of volunteers has formed an emergency service helpline for senior citizens living alone in Bhopal.

The volunteers ensure that the elderly do not have to step out to get supplies like medicines and groceries during the lockdown. With more than 40 volunteers across the city, the helpline has served more than 100 senior citizens by taking medicines and groceries to their doorstep without extra charges.

On Tuesday, the volunteers also took a senior citizen residing in Anand Nagar and suffering from fever to a doctor.

IT consultant Rajneesh Khare, who came up with the emergency service idea, gathered the volunteers through a social media message. “I realised that our Prime Minister had requested senior citizens to stay inside their homes, even before the lockdown, as they are at a greater risk of being affected by coronavirus. In such a situation, when only the old parents are living in the house and their children are out of the city, it will become difficult for them to get things like milk, vegetables, medicines etc. So I decided to ask the youth for their help,” said Khare.

Khare shared the idea on social media and has gained more than 40 volunteers across the city who have so far served around 100 senior citizens in need.

“In a matter of hours, I had volunteers all across Bhopal who would not have to go further than 3-4 kilometres to deliver the necessary items. From Ayodhya bypass to Katara Hills, we have volunteers at all major areas. We then purchased a separate phone and SIM card to receive the requests and forward it to the concerned volunteer,” he added. The volunteers do not charge for delivery and only ask for reimbursement of the expenses.

Khare added, “It has been made absolutely clear that we are doing this to help people, not to take advantage of them in this situation. Whenever we get a request, we ask the people to just pay us for the items either online or through cash if their parents have the money.”

So far, the volunteers got requests from Kolar, Anand Nagar, Katara Hills and other areas of the city. Khare and the other volunteers of the group have got passes made to move out of the house in such cases.

KOLKATA: An email sent to all the departments of Calcutta University last week termed the lockdown as a crisis that may seriously affect the teaching-learning process. The faculty members were requested to help the students while their classes remain suspended for a long time.

The pro-vice-chancellor (academics) Asis Chattopadhyay asked everyone to use online electronic facilities available with them. “You may send study materials, lecture notes, assignments, video lectures and other related materials to the students through mails,” he wrote to the faculty members.

Teachers have also been asked to make sure that the mails reach all the students. For this purpose, students have been asked to share the study materials with those, who don’t have access to internet.

Teachers were suggested to use Google (online class) or any other open sources to deliver online lectures to students, provided they had access to online facilities.

“Teachers can also send files to registrar or librarian for uploading on our university website in order to maintain an inventory and students can download those materials, if necessary,” said Chattopadhyay. “Some teachers of the zoology department are trying to reach out to students by sharing resources like lecture presentations, reading materials in students’ mail groups and clarifying their doubts through mails. One of the teachers has taken an online class. Some others are going to decide the next course of action after getting clarity on whether there would be any change in the academic calendar, which seems to be inevitable and imminent,” said Parthiba Basu, a teacher of this department.

Earlier, the Calcutta University Teachers’ Association had also sent a letter to the CU officials, suggesting some proposals on holding online classes.

Horticulture stores and grocery shops were open in most parts while arrangements were made by municipalities and panchayats with the assistance from their respective MLAs to supply groceries and vegetables to all wards, if not to all homes.Vegetable trucks were seen moving about, stopping at popular junctions to sell vegetables. However, the demand far exceeded the supply in most towns.The exercise of supplying essentials through politicians, however, invited criticism from several quarters terming it as an attempt to derive political mileage.In many towns, youth groups came forward to make arrangements to supply essentials. In Bandora, some youth made arrangements to supply milk and vegetables to people. “Stock was limited, but if government help is received, we can make proper planning so that nobody comes out of their homes,” one youth volunteer said.Several organisations also contributed in relief arrangements.

But the enjoyment was short-lived as a team of Amreli police raided the farm and booked them for violating public notification. These persons were among lakhs, who are natives of Amreli, but settled in Surat for job or business.The massive influx of Amreli and Bhavnagar natives from Surat after rising COVID-19 cases there has left the district administrations perturbed. They are at their wits end over screening such large number of people, many of whom could be potentially infected and could transmit the virus to others.Their worry has aggravated after the death of a 45-year-old woman, who had returned from Surat, to her native village Jesar taluka of Bhavnagar. Official sources said that she had returned few days ago but not informed any authority until she was referred to a government hospital on Sunday morning. “Had the district administration known about her condition, we could have isolated her and begun treatment,” said VK Baranwal, Bhavnagar DDO.Amreli and Bhavnagar collectors told TOI that roughly 3.5 lakh people from Surat have returned to their natives in villages here in the last fortnight. People are hiding in farms, locked themselves up in the house and living at relatives’ place.Police and administration officials said many have smartly skipped the checkposts and taken internal roads to enter the district, while others came in private vehicles like cargo vehicles, bikes tankers and even on foot.Amreli collector Aayush Oak told TOI: “We have deployed a team of 3,500 people for house-to-house survey to know if there are people from Surat, Ahmedabad or Rajkot. It’s a mammoth task to survey all 16 lakh people of the district. People are finding convenient hiding spots or locals are shielding them. Our staff is not welcome in the village and sometimes we have to take the help of police.”He has now now asked sarpanchs to give the details of non-residents after identifying those villages who have more number of people working in Surat. There are nearly five lakh people from Amreli district alone who are engaged in Surat’s diamond and textile industry.The situation in adjoining Bhavnagar is no different. DDO Baranwal said, “There are lakhs of people who have came from Surat to their natives, but we don’t have adequate staff to trace them. We are tired of appealing people to register themselves if they have come from other districts. These people are posing high risk of spreading infection.”Surat collector Dhaval Patel said, ""Many people left Surat for their native villages in Saurashtra even before the lockdown was enforced.

POINGUINIM: Farmers in Canacona taluka are staring at an uncertain future as the 21-day lockdown is coinciding with the rabi crop harvesting season. They are afraid of their efforts for a better produce going in vain.

Most of them called upon the zonal agriculture office seeking help in harvesting the crop yield.

Most paddy crops are ready for harvesting, but the farmers are facing labour scarcity in view of corona outbreak.

In Canacona, around 30 to 40 hectares of land is under cultivation. “It's high time,the government came up with relief measures for the farming community,” said farmers.

Mechanised harvesting in some pockets may not work owing to high terrain locations, and so, farmhands were essential, said a group of farmers from Khola village. “The government should provide farm machinery and manpower to reap the crop, besides threshing and winnowing,’’ they said. Director of agriculture Nevil Alphonso told TOI that the government is not in favour of allowing migrant labourers, but farmers can use available machinery.

“Guidelines to all the zonal agriculture officers have been issued on the availability of machinery to farmers,” he said.

Local authorities have expressed concern that the infected family is not disclosing the places its members visited and the people they met in the recent past.

A 23-year-old man with travel history of 20 days to Punjab and Haryana was declared positive on March 28, following which his parents and elder brother tested positive on March 29. “We have requested the local community leaders to intervene by urging the members to approach us in case they came in contact with the Covid-19 patients,” K K Soni, CMHO, said.

The authorities are collecting clues by using all possible means including call details.

Since the news of three more positive cases was declared late last night, community leaders were on toes tracking those who were close to the family.

The authorities have also informed the community leaders that three positive members of the second family had visited grocery, milk and vegetable stores and offered prayers in the nearby mosque.

Sanjay Bhosale, property tax superintendent, said, “During the lockdown we don’t expect people to make tax payment. We have received directions from the state government to provide relief to the people in whatever way possible. Many owners have called us and said that they are facing financial crisis and are unable to pay the tax.

449,['31/03/2020'],"Online classes keep students busy, teachers say difficult to evaluate","Representative image

LUDHIANA: With a 21-day lockdown at the time when the new academic session normally starts, has really thrown up many challenges for the educational institutions. The first few months is also crucial because this is when the teacher-student equation is set in place, especially among those who come in contact for the first time.

Mona Singh, principal of Guru Nanak Public School in Model Town Extension, said, “Simply sending assignments is not the solution, because not all parents can help their wards in studies. Also, books have not been purchased by the students yet. Giving them assignments is not difficult, but expecting the students to attempt the same without clearing any concepts may not work out. We can post solutions online but that’s not enough.”

However, according to the principal, the school is planning to send assignments just to keep the students busy. “These will be in the form of crossword or writing a diary to maintain a record of their feelings and emotions during the lockdown period. A document that can be preserved for posterity. We are working on other such improvised assignments, which can be done without a textbook.’

Keeping in view the delay in the commencement of the classes, principal Singh said, “We have curtailed our syllabus and the first exam or any other form of formal testing will not take place before September. We intend conducting classes during June.”

Navita Puri, principal of KVM School, said, “It’s very obvious that distance and online study can never match the physical presence in the classroom. The teachers are not fully satisfied with the class interaction. Usually, they take into consideration the different levels of understanding of different students. The students who need extra help could not be detected and helped so far. The students are missing their sports periods, extra curricular activities and, above all, their school friends.”

The biggest challenge according to principal Puri is that some students and teachers haven’t really gotten to know each other, especially the kindergarten and primary class students. “Though technology has made its presence felt in the classroom for the last 15-20 years, the teachers in most Indian schools and colleges are most comfortable still using the board and chalk method. For them suddenly shifting to recording and sending their lectures and not being able to oversee if the student (especially the slow learners) have completed the assigned task is a great mental adjustment and we are happy to see the staff is still going all out to adapt to this online medium of teaching and researching new online methodology and material to provide an enriching learning experience to our students in these adverse circumstances.”

Divjot Kaur, a student of Class X, said, “We are able to manage well in our studies through online videos and assignments uploaded by our school teachers through the e-care app of our school. I am thankful to our school principal and vice-principal for making learning easily available during this period of crisis.”

Vansh Gupta, one of the toppers of Commerce stream, said. “I spend four hours attending the online classes being organ ised by my school. Lessons are very effective and useful, but I miss being in the school. Being at home 24/7 is becoming boring.”

The solution to boredom, according to Vansh’s father, Sumit Bharti could be that schools covering more lessons to keep students occupied for the whole day.

Adabjot Singh Dhillon, a senior KG student at Mount Litra Zee School, said he maintains his daily school work habits with the help of online learning techniques. His father, Satjot Dhillon , said, “These online modules not only help in covering school curriculum, but also keep the kids busy with enjoyable and educating activities.

He is also of the opinion that the school authorities are providing impressive extra study material to help students develop an overall personality. “We, as parents, are grateful to the class teachers for their wonderful efforts.

The villagers alleged that they were not getting essential commodities such as vegetables, milk and other groceries. In a video, a group of youngsters alleged that nearby villagers were denying access to roads close to their villages.

A Birmingham-returned youth and two of his family members had tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday. This, allegedly, has led to the village’s social ostracisation.

In the video, the youngsters urged the authorities to provide them essential commodities. They have accused that village revenue officer (VRO) and village secretary were not visiting their village. “If the situation is like this, who will help us. After the youth tested positive, even milk supply has been cut off. We have been asked not to visit other villages and not pass through the roads in the vicinity by the neighboring villagers,” the youngsters alleged. They urged the government to take immediate action.

Joint collector Loteti Siva Sankar told TOI that the district administration has taken measures regarding the village.

“We have sent revenue divisional officer (RDO) and tahsildar to take immediate measures. We have asked the authorities to provide essential commodities to the village,” said the joint collector.

Complainant Kashinath Shetye besides six others, claimed that the deployment could lead to uncontrollable civil unrest if hungry citizens are dealt with sternly by the CISF.During the hearing, assistant solicitor general of India, Pravin Faldessai assured the commission that proper care and caution would be taken to avoid any incidents of violence.The commission’s member Pramod Kamat stated that it is a fit case for the rights panel to take cognisance of the complaint based on the averments made in the complaint.The group of seven social activists in their complaint to the commission requested for guidelines to be framed to prevent brutality and merciless beating without interrogation by the CISF personnel, especially when the government notified that one person per family can go to the grocery shop and purchase daily essentials Objecting to the request for deployment of CISF, the activists have stated that the government is treating a humanitarian crisis as a law and order problem. The use of force will cause further human rights violations, they said.In the current situation, CISF should have been used to assist the supply chain in disaster management and in “…ensuring a robust service delivery of essentials and helping the stranded people get home,” the activists stated.Deploying CISF in Goa, they say, could lead to “uncontrollable civil unrest if hungry citizens are met with by CISF ‘disciplining’ them,” the activists stated in their complaint.To blame the situation on people found on the roads, is to “absolve the state’s own responsibility to multilingually disseminate information about Covid-19 and measures being taken in Goa and the failure to comply with the human rights to food security of the people,” they added.The activists also raised questions about whether the CISF force brought in from outside the state have been tested for Covid-19 and warn that they could in turn be a threat to Goan public.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74906475,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-206284,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/centre-state-get-2-days-to-reply-on-cisf-deployment/articleshow/74902401.cms

According to police, the complainant — identified as Vaishali Vinaykumar Mane — came in contact with the couple in 2016. The couple had floated a company that was working for training women in rural areas and help them start their own business.

“The couple informed the victim that they only help women belonging to self-help groups and they need to become members of their company to get assistance. Following this, the complainant managed to gather around 100 women from different social-help groups and every one deposited Rs 200 in the company’s account to become members,” a police officer said.

“Since then, the company lured the women by floating different schemes like lottery, annual supply of cheap groceries, among others and collected around Rs 33 lakh from them till September 2018. After the complainant realised that they are being taken for a ride she raised a voice against the suspects following which they stopped replying to her queries,” he added.

The woman finally lodged a complaint with the police. “We have registered a case and booked them under sections 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the IPC. We have not arrested them yet, but will soon initiate action,” Dattatraya Borigidde , police inspector in-charge of Jaysingpur police station, said.

From Kites to Barn Owls, Parakeets, Squirrels, Kingfishers, and Woodpeckers are slowly coming back to the green patches of the city and also to homes with garden space. Even large animals such as Sambhar are seen some colonies.

Explaining the phenomena, Visakhapatnam district forest officer (DFO) Selvam said, “Usually birds and animals travel in search of water, but in and around Visakhapatnam their movement is highly restricted mainly because of urbanisation and continuous traffic movement on either side of the national highway. However, the lockdown has changed things and we have noticed Sambhar herds heading back to their old pastures beyond Seethakonda and the old dairy farm. Visalakshinagar was also a part of their orginal habitat, connecting the Kambalakonda-Seethakonda range with Simhachalam.”

He further said that the Sea Eagle, which was once commonly sighted near the Bheemili Beach Road, is also making its presence felt. “The lockdown can actually show us the extent of these animals’ original habitat. It is good that for a change, animals feel safe,” Selvam added.

“Birds are the first to take advantage of open and free spaces. Once birds show the way, other animals follow suit. It may not be surprising, if animals actually venture into residential areas,” said PV Sivaram, an amateur bird watcher.

MUMBAI: Alarmed by a spurt in Covid-19 cases, the state government on Monday quarantined all 1.8 lakh migrant workers and labourers across the state till April 14.

A senior bureaucrat told TOI that following the 21-day nationwide lockdown declared by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week, all the districts were sealed and a ban imposed on movement of migrant workers .

“Directives were issued to all district collectors to ensure that migrant workers and labourers do not move out of their respective districts and that relief camps be set up for them where food must be provided. It has been decided to quarantine them,” he said.

The measures are in keeping with norms prescribed by the World Health Organisation, said the bureaucrat.

Elaborating, the bureaucrat said the workers have been lodged at relief camps, marriage halls and schools across the state. “Our doctors examine them at least once a day and a distance of at least five feet is maintained between two migrants. It is a difficult task but we have no option. At certain camps, we did face a law-and-order problem, since a large group was insisting on leaving,’’ he said.

The bureaucrat said while the maximum migrants are in the Pune division at over a lakh, Nagpur division has 11,132, Konkan 42,717, Aurangabad 11,435, Amravati 7,420 and Nashik 1,257. The largest number of migrant workers are in Kolhapur at 46,171, followed by Sangli at 45,913, Raigad at 18,326 and Pune 12,460, while there was none in Satara. The district administration will make arrangements for them till the lockdown ends.

The letter was issued on March 21. Now, directors and principals of private schools are objecting, and saying it is not possible for them, as there is imposition of curfew.

JP Bhatt, media organiser from Associated Schools Joint Action Front (Punjab), and director of Rukmani School at Samrala Chowk, said, “The education department is irresponsible, and performing mean activities to demoralise private schools, which is not acceptable. In this day, when whole world has tension for their survival, the education department is busy destroying the rhythm of Punjab with its discriminatory behaviour.”

Prithipal Singh, director of Adarsh Vidya Mandir and secretary- general of Joint Action Front, said, “At present, schools are not in a position to submit any documents to the department because of total lockdown. But school owners are under pressure due to the letter.”

They urged the department to extend dates, like CBSE has done until September. The department has all the documents, and they said it can proceed on the basis of the already submitted documents.

PSEB too had given time to take practical exams of middle class from March 18 to March 26, and now when school officials opened their PSEB portal, they were told the time is over for entering marks for final submission.

A teacher, Pooja, from BDM Senior Secondary School , said, “When teachers have not taken the practical exams during lockdown and curfew, how can we submit the marks? And if we fill the marks just like that, it won’t do justice to students.”

DEO Swaranjeet Kaur said, “This has not come to my notice, and if such a thing is happening, we will raise the matter with the board authorities.”

Education minister Vijay Inder Singla said, “Till the lockdown, everybody can keep the reports with them, and after the lockdown, we will give suitable dates, so that everyone can amicably understand about how much time is required for these private schools to submit documents. We would be issuing a circular at the earliest. No one will be promoted without conducting exams.”

He added, “Till the time there is lockdown, all the exams stand postponed. Once schools open, we will announce a new schedule of the new academic session and conduct of exams. Nothing is happening for now.”

LUDHIANA: Weather continued to be sunny in the city and the temperatures were recorded on higher side on Monday. But the met department is predicting rain on Tuesday and mostly clear sky after that for many days.

Monday morning began on a grey note with clouds, but as the day unwounded itself, sun caught up with it and stayed in Ludhiana’s sky for most part of the day.

The impact of sunny weather reflected on the maximum (day) temperature on Monday, as it was recorded at 27.7 degrees Celsius, which was two degrees less than normal. On Sunday the day temperature was recorded at 27.1 degrees Celsius, which was three degrees less than normal.

The minimum (night) temperature in city on Monday was recorded at 14.5 degrees Celsius, which is around normal but 1.5 degrees Celsius less than on Sunday.

“On Tuesday, there are chances of western disturbance arriving in city. There may be drizzle because of that. Weather is likely to remain clear and dry in the first week of April and there are chances of increase in day temperatures in that week whereas night temperature might remain around normal,” said Surender Paul, director of Met department Chandigarh.

Meanwhile, met department predicts day temperature to rise to 31 degrees Celsius by April 5 whereas the night temperature might rise to 15 degrees till April 1 and then fall to 14 degrees till April 4.

“We were fed up of the frequent changes in weather, as after every few days of sunny weather, it would rain. However, last few days have been good and mostly sunny. In the curfew, this is a blessing as our could bask under the shining sun in the afternoon hours for a while,” said Manish Kumar, a trader from Chandigarh road.

463,['31/03/2020'],Ban on sea fishing may lead to shortage of fish in state,"Visakhapatnam: With the state government imposing a ban on fishing as part of the measures due to the 21-day Covid-19 lockdown, there are now fears over scarcity of fish in the market by mid-April.

While the AP government on March 23 imposed the ban on sea fishing for Andhra fishermen till April 14 as a precautionary measure to check the spread of Covid-19, the Union ministry of fisheries’ mandatory 61-day on fishing ban starts from April 15 and will be in force till June 14 across the east coast of the country, including the Andaman and Nicobar islands.

“It literally means there won’t be any deep sea fishing activity in the state for almost 80 days. Normally, Andhra fishermen spend more time in the sea during March-April to compensate for the 61-day mandatory ban period. But this year, they won’t get that opportunity,” said Arijili Dasu, executive director of Fisherfolk Foundation, a community based fishermen association in the state.

The local fishermen are worried as they won’t get to venture into the sea till mid-June. All their fish stock has already been sold to wholesalers and traders. “Going by the quantity the wholesalers and traders are hoarding now, it would last hardly till the end of April. There would be shortage of fish in the open market at least till end of June, a fortnight after the fishermen venture into the sea again,” added Dasu.

Though traditional fishing boats are exempted from the mandatory annual 61-day fishing ban, the catch volume for these boats has reduced considerably over the years.

“We cannot venture out for more than five to 10 nautical miles with these boats. In those areas fish population is very less. Our total catch is not enough even for the household consumption in Visakhapatnam district,” says M Bulayya, a local fisherman.

Also, with the government stopping daily auction of fish in all coastal districts in the state, it won’t count for much even if they are allowed to go out for fishing.

“This is because they don’t have any storage facilities and whatever they catch can hardly last for a few days,” says Dasu.

Dharshan is worried, of course. He lives with aged mother and two really young daughters. But he is a sole bread-winner of his family after the death of his father a few years ago — his wife takes care of the home — so he has no choice but to work when called.But what makes Dharshan stand out is the fact how quickly he embraced the situation, bringing cheer to his colleagues by narrating positive aspects of the much-dreaded virus. Like the fact that how it is uniting people in fighting it.When TOI met Dharshan, he was about to embark to Rajasthan . “After the outbreak of coronavirus in country, a sense of fear has gripped the workers of various departments of the railways. I realised that there is no point in dwelling on this — except of course to take necessary precautions. The need of the hour is delivering essential commodities to the doorsteps of people so they stay inside and we defeat the virus. For this, my skills of running goods train for several hours are essential. So there is no point in being fearful.”Dharshan is also appreciative of his supportive family. “I receive such positive strength from both my daughters. This really helps in going out there and do the necessary thing,” he added.It helps too that the railway authorities are also taking every possible step to ensure the safety of drivers. “But i feel more can be done. For one, there is a need to sanitise the engines of goods trains requently, as several of us drive to complete a trip,”said Dharshan.",chandigarh,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/meet-the-loco-pilot-who-risks-his-life-so-you-can-get-essentials-at-doorstep/articleshow/74902952.cms
466,['31/03/2020'],"No patient from slums yet, but experts fear the scenario","Nagpur: Even with 16 positive cases of Covid-19 as of Monday, the city has been fortunate not to witness any patient from slums, which are considered high risk zones due to dense population and unhygienic conditions. The administration is yet to announce any plan in case patients are detected from slums, which would require large number of beds, staff, equipment for treatment and many quarantine centres like MLA Hostel , which is the only centre currently.Whenever a patient tests positive, close contacts are brought in for testing. After Khamla businessman and his three family members tested positive, two housemaids, who are from Gautam Nagar slums and Jaitala village, were also brought in for testing. Fortunately, they tested negative and were shifted to MLA Hostel.Similarly, one of the three housemaids of the 14th positive patient , who is from a housing society in front of Gandhisagar Lake, tested negative and is in MLA Hostel. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is searching for the remaining two housemaids.There are around 453 slums in city comprising around 1.50 lakh houses and population of around 9 lakh. Houses in slums are in narrow lanes, and so congested that persons keep coming in close contact easily. Also, slum residents are known to mingle and socialize a lot.Therefore, suspected contact persons are likely to be large in number in case a patient comes from the slums.Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe said, “Already all measures have been taken to control Covid-19, including in slum areas. Containment drive is done in 3km radius of house of patients. Also, NMC is first to launch door-to-door containment drive across the city, including in slums. It is helping to identify suspect patients, high-risk patients and create awareness among people to prevent it. Also, we are ensuring high cleanliness in almost all parts of the city,” he said.Mundhe said, “Administration has chalked out a plan and also kept ready more locations like MLA Hostel. We will reveal them and bring them into use if situation requires,” he said.Experts of epidemiology and infectious diseases said that densely populated areas are more at risk for Covid-19.“In Sangli, 25 members of single family have tested positive. Even authorities have agreed that they lived in a congested set up and hence get infected. Just imagine what will happen if Covid-19 enters Indian slums,” said a senior epidemiologist in GMCH, who is following up the spread and tracing sources of infection in Nagpur since the beginning.The doctor said cases are on the rise in crowded localities, but fortunately not spread out of families so far. “First cluster in Nagpur was limited to only one member of the family while in recent cases more family members have been infected. This could be because of their congested pattern of living. Thankfully, no member living in slums has been detected positive so far. Otherwise situation would be dangerous,” he said.Deans of GMCs and health officials are not ready to talk on record about the preparations in case Covid-19 spreads in communities or slums in city. But, off the record, they have expressed concerns about it. It will be difficult to handle the rush if more number of suspects reach hospitals, they said. GMCH and IGGMCH are already loaded with patients from across Central India. How these two government hospitals will deal in case of community spread is still unknown.One dean said the government must think of acquiring a 200-300 bedded private hospital. “In Rajasthan, the state government has acquired 84 private hospitals on Monday.

468,['31/03/2020'],"Corona Deaths in West bengal: Death in north Bengal, new positive in Kolkata","Customers line up in front of a half-open sweet shop in south Kolkata

KOLKATA/KALIMPONG: The 44-year-old Kalimpong woman, who tested positive for Covid-19 at North Bengal Medical College and Hospital on Saturday, died early on Monday morning, taking Bengal’s toll to two. Another 77-year-old man from Sovabazar tested positive for the disease on Monday, taking the number of Covid-19-positive people in the state to 22.

Health officials would also be waiting to get the swab test result of a pavement dweller, who died at NRS Medical College and Hospital’s isolation ward on Monday, to know whether she would be an addition to Bengal’s toll; she was admitted to the hospital on Sunday with respiratory distress.

The state’s healthcare sys-tem continued to grapple with more bad tidings: the 59-year-old from Hooghly’s Sheoraphuli and the 66-year-old from Baranagar had to be put on ventilation at AMRI, Salt Lake and Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, respectively, after their respiratory distress worsened on Monday even as the 66-year-old Nayabad patient continued to be critical at Peerless Hospital.

But Monday ended with some positive news from Beliaghata’s Infectious Diseases Hospital: Kolkata’s first three Covid-19 patients, including the first (the bureaucrat’s and paeditrician’s son who returned from England with the disease), all tested negative in the second con-firmatory test as well. “They may be released soon,” a senior health department official said.

All 16 patients being treated at ID Hospital, including three children from Nadia’s Tehatta, were stable, doctors said; another Covid-19 patient’s brother, admitted to Peerless Hospital with symptoms of typhoid, tested negative on Monday.

But the state’s healthcare system would be closely monitoring the latest positive case from Kolkata: the 77-year-old trader from Sovabazar. He was admitted to hospital on Saturday with pneumonia and his swab sample report on Monday confirmed he was suffering from Covid-19. He is on ventilation — like the two other patients admitted over the last few days — and his travel history has so far not revealed any contact with foreigners.

He has neither travelled abroad nor to any other state in the recent past, say officials, and it’s still not clear whether he has come in contact with anyone with a foreign travel history.

The state’s healthcare machinery moved fast, putting in quarantine 15 people who came in contact with the Kalimpong woman who died on Monday. She was cremated in Sahudangee on the outskirts of the town after cops intervened and pushed back a mob that tried to stop the hearse from entering the crematorium. The health department is also tracking people who came in contact with her in Siliguri.

The 44-year-old’s husband owns a jewellery shop in Kalimpong, which has a corner space offering money transfer services. All the employees have gone in for 14 days’ self-isolation. The couple have a son and a daughter staying in Kalimpong and another daughter who lives in Mumbai.

469,['31/03/2020'],Mamata Banerjee: Strictly enforce lockdown along West Bengal border,"KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday called for the strictest enforcement of the lockdown along Bengal’s borders to keep migrant workers out of the state. She even directed the administration not to entertain requests from MLAs and MPs on this issue.At the same time, she also took a number of steps to restore the supply of commodities: sweet shops will stay open four hours each day and kirana stores and home deliveries will be allowed to function as normal. And, to cope with hospital bed shortage, each district has been asked to identify and requisition private hospitals, university campuses, forest tourism centres, youth hostels and other centres for use as isolation wards for fever patients.Around two lakh migrant workers from Bengal are held up in other states. “We are getting in touch with them so that they can survive during this two-week lockdown,” Banerjee said. “These two weeks are very crucial. We will sit again on April 13 and may give some relaxation on April 14.” April 14 is Poila Baisakh, the Bengali New Year.The chief minister also pointed out that 40,000 migrant workers from other states are caught up in Bengal. “We are arranging basic amenities for them, like food and shelter,” she said in a video-conference from Nabanna with medicine experts, health officials, district magistrates and superintendents of police. She directed district magistrates to provide food to even those who don’t have the ration cards to collect the earlier-announced relief of five kilos of foodgrain from ration shops.The chief minister said she feared that a fresh influx of migrant workers — such as the one at the Delhi-NCR region a few days ago — would make the rural population of Bengal extremely vulnerable.“As many as 200 migrant workers have entered Islampur in Uttar Dinajpur; how could they enter?” she asked. The North Dinajpur SP replied that the group took a different route and entered through Gajole in Malda. “I don’t want to hear whether they entered through Gajole or Chanchol. This should stop,” she replied.The CM’s other steps — to restore the supply chain — were to ensure the lockdown didn’t descend into chaos. She lifted the lockdown on sweet shops, allowing them to remain open from noon to 4pm, in a bid to help milkmen cater to the demand for milk. Milk traders are among the worst hit because of the lockdown. A lot of milk has remained unsold because milkmen couldn’t market it to households, dairies and sweet shops. “Babies should get milk; milkmen shouldn’t waste their produce,” Banerjee said. She also announced a bonus on the commodity front saying that commodity shops (kirana shops) should be allowed to function normally, along with home deliveries.She also reassured traders, particularly those dealing in food and medicine, after they said police excesses were preventing proper goods delivery. She said that the government was trying for the last three days to remove bottlenecks. The chief minister named a policeman on duty at Alipurduar during her interaction with the Alipurduar SP. “Find out what he is doing. Eta korakori noi, barabari (This is not strict law enforcement, this is excess),” she commented.To citizens, she appealed against panic-buying. “There is no need to stock food and medicine,” the CM said.The chief minister directed the district administrations to identify and requisition each district’s private hospitals, university campuses, forest tourism centres, youth hostels, hospitals run by Bharat Sevashram Sangha away from towns, and set up isolation wards for fever patients. The chief secretary has issued a circular stating that the government will requisition not only the infrastructure, but also the services of doctors and nurses working there. The government plans to bring all of them under novel coronavirus insurance: the chief minister increased the insurance cover from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh till May 15.Banerjee also fixed responsibility on individual officers to coordinate with Swasthya Bhavan on an emergency basis and assigned a senior officer for the five districts of north Bengal. She appeared unhappy with the arrangements so far. The relatives of the Covid-19 victim from Kalimpong have gone public with their experience in such quarantine centres. She talked in great detail about the health infrastructure in each district.Aware of the deficit in the pool of doctors in a state where the patient-doctor ratio is below the national average, the chief minister granted a proposal from North Bengal Medical College authorities to absorb 30 MBBS pass-outs as house staff on stipend. Mamata extended this principle to all medical colleges in the state.The chief minister appealed to citizens to bear with the lockdown for another two weeks to break the virus chain. Chief secretary Rajiva Sinha seized the opportunity to mention that the administration was getting written requests from MLAs and MPs, urging the administration to let the migrant workers to return. “Do not entertain letters from MLAs and MPs,” the CM said, asking the district administration to beef up border surveillance. She assigned senior IPS officer Ajay Kumar to oversee Siliguri, which shares borders with multiple countries.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74903240,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-130791,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/strictly-enforce-lockdown-along-border-mamata/articleshow/74903031.cms
470,['31/03/2020'],How can parents guide children without punishing them?,"It is important for parents to guide and reprimand their children whenever required. However, is punishment the only way to discipline your child? On the contrary, spanks and timeouts do not make your child more disciplined. It, in fact, paves the way for more misbehaviour. The best way of teaching kid is to behave with them the same way we would like them to behave with others. It might be possible that harsher ways of punishment may make your child more aggressive. Time outs, too, are a counter-productive way of parenting. We are leaving kids to deal with their own feeling when they may need us to guide them the most.However, it can be hard to imagine being able to put children on the right path without punishment or time out. Here are 10 ways you can connect more with your kids and teach them important life lessons without any punishments.Resists the urge to act on the first emotion. Instead, wait till you calm down before you address the problem. You will be able to find better solutions. Moreover, watching you is how your kid will also learn to control their emotions. You are their role model. They will pick up a lot of habits, good and bad, by observing you.Sometimes, to prevent a potential outburst of emotions and adrenaline, it is important for you and your child to recognize their emotions well. The best way is to sit with them to talk about what they are feeling. However, you should not make them feel intimidated. Instead, the idea is to create a safe environment where your child can open up about their emotions. This will fill gaps that exist between your relationship and urge your child to come to you for guidance more often.It is important that your behaviour urges your child to be the best version of themselves. While it is necessary to correct your child, it should not be at the cost of your connection. Work towards making the connection first. Always remember most of the indiscipline stems from a feeling of being left out and feeling disconnected.It is necessary for parents to create some kind of boundaries and limits. That is given. However, the same can be done with more empathy. Take time to know how your child is feeling and what they think should be done. Make it sound more like a discussion rather than a command. This prevents feelings of defiance from festering and the child feels more confident and understood. Give your child a choice for solving the problem at hand.Even if you don't find the reason to be reasonable enough, your child’s behaviour reflects what they are feeling at that time. They might want to spend more time with you. Is he is acting terribly? It might be possible that he is feeling terrible. It is important that you recognize what he is feeling and try and find a solution to his problem rather than his behaviour. You can eliminate the behaviour by addressing the underlying need.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74899579,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-192552/74899579.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/parenting/toddler-year-and-beyond/how-can-parents-guide-children-without-punishing-them/articleshow/74899588.cms

SURAT: While ensuring social distancing is followed across the society, cops too are taking measures to avoid coming in direct contact with each other. Police officials are now holding ‘tech-enabled meetings ’ to discuss status of law and order in the city and also issues related to other crisis within their jurisdictions.

Police are using social media applications freely available on mobile phones and hassle free. In the normal mode of video conference, a whole set-up of electronics is required, but through the mobile application, video conference on the phone is possible anywhere and everywhere. It merely requires a good quality mobile data coverage.

""In current times, while the officers are multitasking, their presence on the road is imperative. Considering all these factors, we found holding video conference meetings over the phone to be more feasible,” said Vidhi Chaudhary, deputy commissioner of police, zone III, Surat. By installing the Zoom app, 100 participants can hold a meeting for 45 minutes.

Through Zoom, police officers can know the exact locations of their colleagues participating in the meeting. This helps seniors verify location of the junior officers and instruct them instantly to go to a specific location to assess the situation live even while the meeting is going on.

Starting from the police inspectors to the city police commissioner R B Brahmbhatt, all officers of the city police are using the application.

Police officers are not only saving time but also reducing the risk involved in holding physical meetings at one place. “Using the mobile application we can reduce time spent on reaching the meeting spot. By this we can also ensure that we follow the guideline of social distancing,"" Chaudhary added.

Coming back to our homes filled with positive energy, helps us relax and keep our peace of mind. Feng Shui, which is basically a Chinese practice of creating positive energy flow in our environment also suggests several things to incorporate in our homes.Here are a few Feng Shui tips to keep in mind while redecorating our homes.Fen Shui says that if you have a large window opposite a door, then the energy of the room will be pushed right out of the window. In order to maintain a room’s energy several blocking techniques could be used.You can place curtains or blinds on the window to contain the energy, but the best way to partially block the energy is by using plants. Placing potted plants on the sides of the window will not only attract positive energy but will also keep you close to nature.Colors play a very important role in lifting or dropping the energy of a place. Bright color combinations can instantly lift the dull and negative energy of your home. If you are redecorating your home, then you must color coordinate your home by using light colors.You can incorporate shades of white, grey, blue and green and contrast them according to your wish. You can also take into consideration pastel colors which are the happy-go-lucky colors of all time.Feng Shui products not only add more beauty to your house but also helps in maintaining a positive aura around it. You can add a fountain along with small bonsai plants to complement it. Feng Shui paintings and artworks are some other good options to fill your house with positive energy.A Buddha statue can also be placed on your living room shelf or office table to attract good vibes.Quite old and well-known Feng Shui to attract positive energy in the bedroom is by leaving space on both sides of the bed. It applies to both double and single bed owners. You must never stick your bed’s one side to the wall, keeping only the other side open.It is said that when you leave space on both the sides, the flow of good energy is maintained in a proper manner. On the other hand, when you are sticking your bed’s side to the wall you are blocking your positive energy flow.Feng Shui is all about creating space for easy flow of positive energy. It is said that you must not fill things in your room just for the sake of keeping them. Take out unnecessary items which are lying idle and are requiring negative space in your room. Place your sofa in such a way that the main door is visible from there and never place it the other way round, as it is said to block positive energy.Decluttering your room will make it airier and more relaxed which will further attract only good vibes.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74900934,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1904691/74900934.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/home-garden/5-feng-shui-tips-to-keep-in-mind-while-redecorating-your-home/articleshow/74900915.cms

Authorities ruled out shifting of all employees of the company and has home-quarantined them instead, assigning one constable to monitor 10 of them to ensure they stay indoors.

Since Friday, 10 employees have tested positive and results on 30 samples are awaited.

As of Monday, 753 workers of the company have been home-quarantined. Groceries and other essential supplies would be reached to them, authorities said. After the infections were classified as a “cluster case”, the district administration had planned to quarantine all employees of the firm at choultries and other public buildings but health experts advised against it, saying it could cause virus to spread further.

The district administration has got the company to pay 30% of employees’ salary in cash to ensure those home-quarantined can buy essential commodities. District minister V Somanna, who held a meeting with officials, said the employees will get at least Rs 5,000 in cash from the company within a couple of days.

A sense of fear pervades Nanjangud, a temple town of 60,000 people just over 20km from the city. Located on the national highway, it is now out of bounds for people while Nanjangud Industrial area, 3km from town limits, is closed. Only a few units deemed essential are allowed to operate. The administration has cancelled the car festival of Lord Sri Srikanteshwara scheduled on April 3 — the first time ever, recall residents.

MUMBAI: With just two days left for the next EMI cycle to begin, most big lenders are unprepared to follow the Reserve Bank of India ’s blanket order allowing borrowers to hold back from paying instalments for the month. Top lenders such as State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Bank and Axis Bank have not activated any channel for customers to exercise an option.

As a result, there was confusion among borrowers on Monday as many received text messages alerting them that their loan EMIs would be debited from their accounts and they needed to maintain adequate balance. Starting Wednesday, borrowers are due to pay their monthly instalment but banks are not ready yet to implement the special facility created by the RBI, which allows borrowers to avoid paying three EMIs without being classified as a loan defaulter.

Most bank branches have not received any instructions from their headquarters on deferment of instalments and many are reluctant to accept requests. On their part, bankers suggested, deferring EMIs is an option for borrowers, but there is no benefit for those who can pay.

The SBI, source told TOI, will put in place an option for borrowers to repay failing which the EMIs will be deferred. Mortgage player HDFC will reach out to borrowers over the next few days through emails and SMSs, informing them about the option, which can be through a link on its website, a spokesperson said. Borrowers will also have the option to continue with the EMIs.

Coronavirus outbreak: Complete coverage

Another private bank executive said that it may take a couple of days to operationalise the deferment option. One bank said that it is considering delaying EMI debits for the first few days until a system is in place.

In case banks do not pause standing instructions for debiting bank accounts and the transaction fails, most banks have a penalty equal to that of a cheque bounce, with charges ranging from Rs 200 to Rs 400. For most retail loans, including housing, auto and other personal loans, banks obtain standing instructions to debit monthly EMIs from a customer’s salary account. A bulk of the deductions happen in the first week of the month.

“Customers must realise that this is not a waiver but just a facility provided to avoid being classified as a defaulter if they miss their instalment due to liquidity problems. There is no advantage in delaying as interest charges will continue to accrue for the three months even if it is collected later,” said a banker.

A majority of the large stores are willing to take up door-delivery only for orders above Rs 25,000-Rs 30,000 while the commoners’ monthly grocery bill is around Rs 3,000-Rs 4,000.The lukewarm response of the big retailers has upset the authorities’ plans to doorstep-deliver groceries. Initially, all the big retailers and branded grocery stores had expressed willingness to supply stocks to homes when district collector Samuel Anand Kumar reviewed the situation last week.The district administration had circulated the WhatsApp numbers of the retailers through media asking people to post their grocery requirements with the respective shoppers to get the stocks door-delivered. Authorities thought that such an arrangement would help keep people indoors.People dependent on retail stores in the past, heaved a sigh of relief and hurriedly posted their needs. To their utter shock, the customer service numbers of the malls became unresponsive. There was no response from the stores even on the WhatsApp numbers.Sources said that they became unresponsive as they were flooded with requests. A few of the stores finally responded, stating that they are unable to handle individual requests for door-delivery. “We can send stock to the apartments where at least 20-30 flat owners together post their requirement as sending the groceries to the door-steps of individual houses is a big task, particularly with police restrictions in place,” said a senior executive of a branded retail store on condition of anonymity. He said they have agreed to extend the door-delivery facility only when there is sufficient volume of order.Unlike in metro cities where apartment complexes have 100-150 flats, apartment complexes in Vijayawada and Guntur cities have 20-30 flats. A few places, the complexes have 40-50 flats. Moreover, residents welfare associations are not involved in booking groceries for all. So, many residents are posting their individual needs prompting the stores to refuse.Following the development, the district collector directed the joint collector to convene another round of meeting with the grocery merchants and rope in small merchants to supply goods to the door-steps of customers to prevent people from stepping out during the lockdown.",vijayawada,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govts-plan-to-home-deliver-groceries-runs-into-trouble/articleshow/74900435.cms

Homemaker Mira Mahato was taken to Bengaluru for treatment on March 19 after doctors in Midnapore failed to make her better, her daughter Rina (28) said.

“My mother was a cardiac patient. She passed away on Saturday afternoon (around 1.40pm) and doctors there mentioned cardiac arrest in her death certificate.”

Mira’s body was brought in an ambulance to their village home in Kalaikunda’s Hariyatara. “Locals prevented us from cremating my mother in the crematorium adjoining our village. They said since she had died in Bengaluru, they feared she might have died of Corona virus,” Rina said. “We tried to reason with them and showed the death certificate. But they wouldn’t listen.”

The family then took Mira’s body to Midnapore town’s Padmavati crematorium. “There too we faced similar resistance,” Rina said.

After residents informed police, the family was told to bring the ambulance carrying the body to Kotwali police station. “Police checked my mother’s death certtificate and asked us to take the body back to Kalaikunda. We sought police help and took my mother’s body to Poradiha forest nearby where we buried her,” Rina said.
