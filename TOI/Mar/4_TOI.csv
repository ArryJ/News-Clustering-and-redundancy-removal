0,['4/03/2020'],Varane Avashyamund: Johny Antony: Making a person laugh in real life is an extremely difficult task,"The star-studded Varane Avashyamund could be noted for being Kalyani Priyadarshan’s debut, but it also heralded the arrival of a new comedian in the film industry — Johny Antony . The filmmaker, who has helmed movies such as CID Moosa and Thoppil Joppan, had ventured into acting a few years ago but his role as the psychologist Dr Bose in the recent Anoop Sathyan directorial had the audience in splits. The director-actor talks about his role, his acting dreams, direction and more.I have always focused on being part of the film industry. I tried my hand at acting in Shikari Shambu at the insistence of its producer, director Sugeeth and scriptwriter Nishad Koya. After that Ranjith’s Drama happened in which I had a full-length role. So, gradually acting became a new area of interest for me and during the period, I was mostly offered comic roles. Anoop, was the assistant director of Lal Jose’s Thattumpurath Achuthan in which I did a role, when he told me about his plans for his debut directorial, Varane Avashyamund. He informed me that there is a doctor’s role in the film and I would fit the bill perfectly. Now, I am glad that people have accepted Dr Bose.As the captain of the ship, Anoop had a wonderful script and clarity on how the film would be. He welcomed my suggestions and gave me freedom to improvise too. Interestingly, my normal slang and way of talking were used for Dr Bose also. Apart from the tit-for-tat comedy dialogues, I think what made Dr Bose interesting was his dynamic body language. That made him funnier.More than the comedy situations and dialogues, there was an instance that touched my heart. It was a scene during a rainy day and after consultation, Dr Bose asks Major Unnikrishnan (Suresh Gopi) in the film if there is rain at his place. Suresh tells that usually soldiers are sent to places when there are natural disaster and nobody ever asks a soldier if there is such a problem at his place? That moved me.I have only acted in a few films but among them, I liked Anto Aliyan in Drama and the karate master in Thattumpurath Achuthan.Well, both are different. I love direction and wish to be known as a director. I would take up acting only when I don’t have any directorial commitments. It is fun to explore acting. Compared to direction, acting is a cakewalk for me. But there are some challenges too, because performing comedy is not easy. Making a person laugh is the most difficult task in life.I am part of a film directed by Arun Vaiga titled Upacharapoorvam Gunda Jayan. It’s a comedy-centric role and my character Purushan is lively just like Dr Bose.Also, I am working on a new directorial, a family drama which will have Biju Menon in the lead. I would like to add that I used to have conversations with Dileep and Sibi K Thomas, on CID Moosa’s sequel. If everything falls in place including Dileep and Arjun the dog, you can look forward to that.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74459634,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-210314/74459634.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/johny-antony-making-a-person-laugh-in-real-life-is-an-extremely-difficult-task/articleshow/74459557.cms
1,['4/03/2020'],Shoot at Site: Colors is female-driven action drama with a twist,"– Sajan Kalathin, cinematographer







– Ramkumar, actor





– Run Ravi, stunt director







Clad in tights and a smart denim jacket, Varalaxmi Sarathkumar is thrown to the ground after a few punches fly in the air. Briefly after, a ‘Cut’ is hollered, and the actress rubs the sand and dirt off her pants, moving towards the monitor at the MGR Film City. “Fight comes naturally to me because I have been doing action in most of my films,” the actress says with a grin, as we catch a spot, escaping the sun, to discuss Colors , her new film.Directed by Malayalam filmmaker Nissar , the film is a female-driven action drama, we are told. However, there is more to it than meets the eye, says Varalaxmi, who plays a martial artiste in the film. “The martial arts bit of it was very interesting and I got to do some funky stuff. It is too early to talk about the subject because if I explain it, the cat will be out of the bag,” she says with a laugh, before excusing herself to get her hands dirty in the sand for another shot.The film, which has a national level martial artiste on board for training, is big on styling and agility, the actress tells us just before going for the shot.Also starring Ramkumar, the film’s shooting is almost in its last stages. Ask the actor to describe his character and a small pause ensues. “I am not sure if I can talk about my role, because if I do, it might just unravel the entire plot,” he says, adding, “I am called the Sri Krishna of the film because I am the only man in this female-driven cast.”Yes, there’s Ineya and Divya Pillai in leading roles, too, and most of the film was shot in Kerala. Nissar, who has Malayalam films like Sudhinam and Three Men Army to his credit, adds that the film lended itself well to Tamil sensibilities. “This is my 26th film and my first outing in Tamil. I thought this subject will be well-suited to Tamil sensibilities. I could gauge this because I am a big fan of Tamil films,” he says, going on to explain the film’s title. Like every character we meet in life, the characters in the film, too, have their own characteristic tones, he says. “The characters in the film can be associated with different colours,” the filmmaker notes.Right from Podaa Podi, I have always been drawn to different roles. People are often confused and ask me if I am the lead or the supporting character or the negative character in my films. But don’t like to categorise myself into one particular slot. If you are an actress, you should be able to do anything and be convincing in that role. I don’t like falling into any kind of stereotypes. People have started accepting and writing female-centric films now. I am enjoying this whole space in Tamil cinema right now.— Varalaxmi, actressThis my second Tamil film after Virunthali. It’s an interesting film to shoot because the actionsequences, too, have a nice touch to them. While the action is subdued, it has turned out to be good on screen. The stunt master has handled the movements very nicely.I was initially scared to work with Nissar sir. But once I entered the set, it became easy. He tells us exactly what he wants from a scene, gets involved in the entire process and acts out every sequence.We choreograph the stunts after listening to the briefs from the cameraperson and the director. The stunts should be in keeping with the script. We also worked with a martial arts team from Kerala for the film. Cinema has its own style, so we picked up the movements that would best suit our sensibilities.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74458382,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1175150/74458382.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/shoot-at-site-colors-is-female-driven-action-drama-with-a-twist/articleshow/74458382.cms
2,['4/03/2020'],Regina’s role in this film has a Ramayana connect,"One of the integral characters in the epic Ramayana is Shurpanakha, sister of Ravana. While several films have traced the journey of Ram, Sita and Lakshman, not many have exclusively dealt with Shurpanakha — her character graph and her emotional journey. And that’s probably what pushed Caarthick Raju to explore the life of Shurpanakha in his upcoming film and draw a parallel between her and his lead character, played by Regina Cassandra The director has titled his film Soorpanagai and also released its first look, featuring Regina in a royal garb. “Shurpanakha, or Soorpanagai as we call her, is an interesting character. We have read about how her parents consulted astrological charts to slot an auspicious time and star for her birth. She went through various emotional upheavals, has experienced love and hatred. But she was quite brutal, too,” says Caarthick.Ask him about the connection between the epic character and Regina’s role in the film, and he says, “Regina plays an archaeologist, Soorpanagai, and her personality is very similar to that of the mythological character. When she digs out some information during an excavation, she finds that she has similarities to this character that we’ve shown in the first look. This portion takes place in the 1920s, where Regina’s character hails from a zamindar family. We have read about how Arabs execute people in front of a crowd if they have committed a crime. In our history, too, there was something called an irumbu kanni (iron maiden), a circular device with nails. This has a connect to the story as well.”The shoot of the film, which also stars Akshara Gowda and Sathish, is nearing completion. “After Chennai and Hyderabad, we are presently shooting in Courtallam,” he signs off.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74458281,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1478893/74458281.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/reginas-role-in-this-film-has-a-ramayana-connect/articleshow/74458281.cms
3,['4/03/2020'],Kinshuk Vaidya to play Arjun again,"After exploring the friendship between Krishna and Radha, Siddharth Kumar Tewary ’s 'RadhaKrishn' will now highlight the bonding shared by Krishna and Arjun . Ask the producer if the track around Radha and Krishna is over, and he replies, “We had earlier portrayed the relationship between Rukmini and Krishna. The Krishna-Arjun friendship is also an interesting part of Krishna’s life, but that does not mean that the show will move away from Radha and Krishna. It will always be about them and their journey.”Meanwhile, Kinshuk Vaidya , who played Arjun in ' Karn Sangini ' last year, has been roped in to play the Pandava warrior in 'RadhaKrishn'. So, won’t it be repetitive to play Arjun again? Kinshuk replies, “'Karn Sangini' was more about Karna and Arjun’s friendship. Karna was also the central character in that show. Here, the makers are exploring Krishna and Arjun’s friendship, which was the most important part of Mahabharat, but my track will only focus on the friendship.”Coincidentally, Kinshuk’s actress girlfriend Shivya Pathania , who was last seen in 'Ram Siya Ke Luv Kush ', was seen playing Radha in the first episode of 'RadhaKrishn'. Point it out and he says, “Shivya and I enjoy playing mytho characters, and we are happy that we get such powerful roles. It’s just a coincidence that both of us get such roles.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74456118,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-70898/74456118.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/kinshuk-vaidya-to-play-arjun-again/articleshow/74456134.cms
4,['4/03/2020'],Wrestlers Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia talk about the pressures of representing the sport on the international stage,"

Ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, wrestlers Sakshi Malik , who had won a bronze in the previous edition, and Bajrang Punia are taking it one step at a time, in hope to clinch a medal for the nation. While their wins may be celebrated, pictures on social media often get negative comments when they have a bad run. Sakshi even admits she has stopped posting pictures online, because of the nasty comments. We caught up with the duo in Bengaluru, where they got candid with us. Excerpts from the chat...

There are a lot of expectations, especially from the wrestling team, ahead of the Olympics. How are you preparing for the same?

Sakshi: As of now, I’m focusing on the Olympic qualifiers that are scheduled to take place in May. I look at the tournaments one at a time. There is a lot of pressure from people, especially since I won the bronze at Rio Olympics. The expectations are high. But, it’s my job — I have to give my best at every competition.

Bajrang: Every athlete prepares to win a tournament. Competing at the Olympics is every athlete’s dream and I have the same dream. I wish to win a medal for the country. I am working on my weaknesses and I am training non-stop, an athlete never stops training.

Whenever an athlete wins, the whole country celebrates. But when the same athlete loses, there is sharp criticism.

Sakshi: Pata nahi aisa kyun hota hai? When we win, everyone celebrates with us, but when we lose, everyone questions our ability to perform. This is not a good thing — it’s like they are playing with our minds. Not only me, but all athletes and sportspersons work really hard. Winning or losing is a part of an athlete’s life. Ek second mei jeet jao, toh athlete superstar hai, lekin haar jao, toh uss athlete ne koi badi galti kar di hai. I won my medal at the Rio Oylmpics at the last minute — in our sport, it comes down to the very last minute. If I lose a match at the last moment, then people raise questions about my fitness, my ability to perform. No one understands that it’s a contact sport and it is tough. We aren’t machines, we are humans too. It does feel bad when people say that I lost. Jeeti bhi toh mai hi thi. Why don’t people stand by me or any other athlete when we lose?

Bajrang: It all depends on what kind of people you choose to be with. If you are with people who talk negative about you, you will feel pressurised. My team and other athletes tell me before every bout, that I can win and I can do it — it doesn’t matter who is your opponent. It all comes down to how your friends, family and others motivate you. At the same time, I feel, that we need sharp criticism sometimes. If you need to do well, you need such people. Haar se bhi kuch na kuch seekhne ko milta hai. We learn from criticism and that motivates me. When any athlete competes, they fight with conviction, including their opponent. No one prepares to lose, everyone trains to win a medal for their country.

What needs to be done to change this perception?

Sakshi: We play for our country first. It is such a proud moment for any athlete to win a medal for their country and do a victory lap with the tricolour. That time everyone supports us and wants to click our pictures. We receive a lot of love, but the moment we lose, everything changes. People need to support us in our good and bad times. If we have the support from everyone, especially during our bad times, it will motivate us to do better. People shouldn’t write us off after one loss, it is very demotivating. I cannot win a gold every single time. For instance, if I lose a tournament, but I put up pictures on social media, people question and say, ‘why are you posting pictures? You have lost, what are you so happy about?’. This doesn’t happen with other athletes from other countries. I’ve seen people support their athletes through thick and thin in other countries. In India, we are very quick to judge others. I think twice before putting up any pictures, because people will say, ‘ye toh parties mei jaa rahi hai’.

Is blocking comments a solution?

Sakshi: If I win and put up pictures no one will say anything. But, if I lose and put a picture of me trying to having a good time, then I have to think twice. I tell myself, ‘time kharab chal raha hai, toh soch ke pictures daalna’. This sort of attitude needs to change. This pressure ruins a lot of athletes. I put up pictures very rarely because of this mindset. Mann hi nahi karta hai, because it creates a lot of pressure on me. I block all such comments by not putting up pictures at all! But how many people will I block? Someone will see the pictures and comments and say, ‘Did you see what they have written about you?’

Bajrang: People will talk if you do well and they will talk if you lose too. People need to understand that winning or losing is a part of the game. We don’t train to lose. There is no athlete who wins every single time. If people know you well, they will never point a finger at you. They will tell you how to improve. I don’t react to such comments, I don’t read them also.

10,['4/03/2020'],Kashmir team in Kerala: The sea and Kerala’s rice and sambar capture the hearts of Kashmiri youth,"Eighteen-year-old Imran Hussain Malik was seeing a beach for the first time in his life and it fascinated him. In fact, for the group of 131 visiting Kashmiri students, Neyyar Dam, coconut trees, beaches and even the Malayalam language was a thing of unending curiosity.

Coming from a land embroiled in calamities, the youngsters were excited about their new experiences during their six-day student exchange programme in Thiruvananthapuram, organised by the Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan and Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. Apart from sightseeing, the team, from various districts in Kashmir aged between 18 and 22, had an interactive session with prominent personalities here and experienced the best of Kerala culture, games and food. It was all so new to them; they mistook jackfruit chips for fried onions.

Sharing his joy, Imran says, “I had mixed feelings when the sea waves kissed my feet for the first time in my life. We have shot many pictures and videos to show to family and friends back home. People here seem more mature in their behaviour, with a vibrantly mixed society, which thrives on harmony.”

Athira Santhosh, one of the volunteers who was a guide to the Kashmiri team , says it was nice to see their child-like curiosity about everything from the coconut shells to jackfruit. “Now they all are fans of our local cuisine and love chor and sambar. They have even learnt simple Malayalam words, like for hunger and ‘what is your name’,” she says, even as Imran greets her with a ‘sukhamano chechi’.

B Ali Sabrin, district youth co-ordinator at Thiruvananthapuram, who was guiding the team, says it was an interesting experience to see the students at their first DJ night. “We arranged a DJ night and dinner for the team on the first day at Veli, but they just sat around watching quietly, despite the ear-thumping, dance music being played. When volunteers coaxed them to dance, they said they were experiencing this for the first time and did not know how to respond to music. We realised life is very different for youngsters there,” says Ali.

The students said they had come down to Kerala, thinking the State was poor, but the visit changed their notion. “We enjoyed God’s Own Country. The hospitality, well-built houses, cheerful and friendly people, fresh, smoke-free air and lush green coconut trees were a novel treat for us. We have become fans of jackfruit and banana chips, which we are taking back with us to Kashmir,” says Rahi Riyaz Ahmed, social and environmentalist and team leader of the group.

Chaitra says, “Turning director has been my plan from the time I got into the Kannada film industry. But I did not want to make a run-of-the-mill commercial flick.

Even though he is busy with films, the actor says that he couldn’t refuse this offer.He says, “I am busy with two Telugu films — Andala Rakshasadu and Jenma Jenmala Bandham. In Tamil, I was working on Munnal Kadhali, which is ready for release. I also have Olipadhivaalan, Lungi Raja and Aama Naa Porikidhaan. So, I never thought of doing television until I got this offer. When the channel approached me, I thought I would give it a try and listened to the story first. They told me that it is a remake of the hit Kannada serial, Jothe Jotheyali. They gave me a link and asked me to watch a few episodes. I started watching that night and ended up pulling an all-nighter. I couldn’t stop as I loved the way the story progressed. The hero’s character was written very well. He is a self-made millionaire. But he is a very kind, generous and down-to-earth person. The heroine, too, falls for his kind nature. The subject was nice and the serial was shot like a big-budget film. I decided not to miss this opportunity and took up the offer. And now, I enjoy playing the role of Suryaprakash.”Jai Akash is certain that this serial will give him a big exposure among Tamil audiences. He says, “I am grateful to the channel and producers for selecting me. More than films, this serial will give me a big reach here. Television and internet are big now.

13,['4/03/2020'],Sayantani Ghosh’s character to be bumped off in 'Naagin',"A month after Jasmin Bhasin ’s character was bumped off in 'Naagin 4', another principal character’s track is all set to wind up. Actress Sayantani Ghosh — the original naagin of Indian television — who joined the franchise this season, will soon exit the show.When contacted, Sayantani said, “Yes, my character is winding up. As a show, 'Naagin' has to keep the audience on the edge of their seats and hence, the team has to introduce high-points and shockers at every stage. The creative team has decided that killing my character would serve as a big high-point.”So, how has she taken the development? “See, parting is never easy, as you get attached to the team. As an artiste, you feel bad, but such is the nature of this industry. Also, no character is above the show. Though the show is doing well, it hasn’t matched up to the last seasons’ ratings, yet. In my 15 years of experience, I have understood that TV shows are governed by the ratings. I hope that the track, which marks my exit, works. That will be a big consolation (smiles).”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74456324,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-46127/74456324.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/now-sayantani-ghoshs-character-to-be-bumped-off-in-naagin/articleshow/74456212.cms

15,['4/03/2020'],Wrestlers Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia talk about the pressures of representing the sport on the international stage,"Ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, wrestlers Sakshi Malik, who had won a bronze in the previous edition, and Bajrang Punia are taking it one step at a time, in hope to clinch a medal for the nation. While their wins may be celebrated, pictures on social media often get negative comments when they have a bad run. Sakshi even admits she has stopped posting pictures online, because of the nasty comments. We caught up with the duo in Bengaluru, where they got candid with us. Excerpts from the chat...Sakshi: As of now, I’m focusing on the Olympic qualifiers that are scheduled to take place in May. I look at the tournaments one at a time. There is a lot of pressure from people, especially since I won the bronze at Rio Olympics. The expectations are high. But, it’s my job — I have to give my best at every competition.Bajrang: Every athlete prepares to win a tournament. Competing at the Olympics is every athlete’s dream and I have the same dream. I wish to win a medal for the country. I am working on my weaknesses and I am training non-stop, an athlete never stops training.Sakshi: Pata nahi aisa kyun hota hai? When we win, everyone celebrates with us, but when we lose, everyone questions our ability to perform. This is not a good thing — it’s like they are playing with our minds. Not only me, but all athletes and sportspersons work really hard. Winning or losing is a part of an athlete’s life. Ek second mei jeet jao, toh athlete superstar hai, lekin haar jao, toh uss athlete ne koi badi galti kar di hai. I won my medal at the Rio Oylmpics at the last minute — in our sport, it comes down to the very last minute. If I lose a match at the last moment, then people raise questions about my fitness, my ability to perform. No one understands that it’s a contact sport and it is tough. We aren’t machines, we are humans too. It does feel bad when people say that I lost. Jeeti bhi toh mai hi thi. Why don’t people stand by me or any other athlete when we lose?Bajrang: It all depends on what kind of people you choose to be with. If you are with people who talk negative about you, you will feel pressurised. My team and other athletes tell me before every bout, that I can win and I can do it — it doesn’t matter who is your opponent. It all comes down to how your friends, family and others motivate you. At the same time, I feel, that we need sharp criticism sometimes. If you need to do well, you need such people. Haar se bhi kuch na kuch seekhne ko milta hai. We learn from criticism and that motivates me. When any athlete competes, they fight with conviction, including their opponent. No one prepares to lose, everyone trains to win a medal for their country.Sakshi: We play for our country first. It is such a proud moment for any athlete to win a medal for their country and do a victory lap with the tricolour. That time everyone supports us and wants to click our pictures. We receive a lot of love, but the moment we lose, everything changes. People need to support us in our good and bad times. If we have the support from everyone, especially during our bad times, it will motivate us to do better. People shouldn’t write us off after one loss, it is very demotivating. I cannot win a gold every single time. For instance, if I lose a tournament, but I put up pictures on social media, people question and say, ‘why are you posting pictures? You have lost, what are you so happy about?’. This doesn’t happen with other athletes from other countries. I’ve seen people support their athletes through thick and thin in other countries. In India, we are very quick to judge others. I think twice before putting up any pictures, because people will say, ‘ye toh parties mei jaa rahi hai’.Sakshi: If I win and put up pictures no one will say anything. But, if I lose and put a picture of me trying to having a good time, then I have to think twice. I tell myself, ‘time kharab chal raha hai, toh soch ke pictures daalna’. This sort of attitude needs to change. This pressure ruins a lot of athletes. I put up pictures very rarely because of this mindset. Mann hi nahi karta hai, because it creates a lot of pressure on me. I block all such comments by not putting up pictures at all! But how many people will I block? Someone will see the pictures and comments and say, ‘Did you see what they have written about you?’Bajrang: People will talk if you do well and they will talk if you lose too. People need to understand that winning or losing is a part of the game. We don’t train to lose. There is no athlete who wins every single time. If people know you well, they will never point a finger at you. They will tell you how to improve. I don’t react to such comments, I don’t read them also.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74460291,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-179757/74460291.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/wrestlers-sakshi-malik-and-bajrang-punia-talk-about-the-pressures-of-representing-the-sport-on-the-international-stage-during-their-visit-to-the-city/articleshow/74460219.cms

18,['4/03/2020'],Brew a storm in your tea cup with blue pea flowers,"Move over black and green tea. How about trying some blue tea instead? This variant not only tastes good, but has plenty of health benefits as well. Currently trending in a few tea bars and health cafes in Kolkata, this herbal tea is made by infusing blue pea or butterfly pea flowers (Aparajita). The beverage has zero caffeine content and changes colour when a dash of lime is added to it. Priti Sen Arora, owner of a city café that specialises in a variety of tea concoctions, said, “Apart from rendering a beautiful lilac or purple colour, butterfly pea flower is a mood enhancer, stress reliever and is filled with anti-inflammatory properties. It is also said to improve cognitive function.”

Unique properties of butterfly pea flower

What sets the butterfly pea flower apart from other flowers is its unique property to change colour when it comes in contact with anything acidic. The bright blue colour of the flower extract will turn pink or purple due to a change in the pH level when a few drops of lime juice are added to it. When some hibiscus leaves are added to the tea, one can get a beautiful red-coloured beverage. Rituparna Banerjee, founder of a city-based culinary studio, said, “In one of our food pop-ups, where we introduced blue pea flower tea, and squeezed a lemon into it to show the guests how the colour changed from blue to purple, they were surprised. I think this change of colour adds a lot of drama and is therefore enjoyed by all age groups.”

Influence of butterfly pea flowers in Bengali cuisine

The butterfly pea or the Aparajita flower is used to worship Lord Shiva in West Bengal . Talking about the influence of the flower in the Bengali cuisine, food historian Pritha Sen said, “The Aparajita flower is used in our household for various religious rituals. Digging into the history of the usage of the flower in the Bengali cuisine, I found that it has not been used much except for the fact that the Rajbansi community of north Bengal used this flower extract to add colour in sherbets.”

Usage in global cuisine

The flower is widely used in Southeast Asia as a natural food colouring added to glutinous rice. In Burmese and Thai cuisines, butterfly pea flowers are also dipped in batter and fried. In the Kelantan region of east Malaysia, people add a few buds of the flower in a pot while cooking white rice to impart a bluish tint, which is known as nasi kerabu . In Thailand and Vietnam, the tea is often mixed with honey and lemon to enhance the taste and give the beverage a pink-purple colour. It is found in both hot and cold variants.

Health benefits of blue tea

The blue flower is packed with loads of health benefits. “The tea is not just a great antioxidant but also reduces inflammation. It’s a stress reliever and helps improve eyesight too. This type of tea has been there for ages and is quite popular in Southeast Asian countries. The trend is fast catching up in the city and is definitely a rage for its colour changing property,” said chef Urvika Kanoi, owner of a city café.

Ingredients: 500 ml of water, 10 dried butterfly pea flowers

Method: Boil water in a saucepan. Remove the sepal (green part) of the flower and pour it into the saucepan. Let it boil for 10 minutes. As flowers start to fade, the water will turn blue. Since these flowers don’t have a distinct smell or taste, one can add spices like cloves, cardamom or ginger before pouring it into a cup. You can also add a dash of lime to enhance the taste and see the beverage turn purplish pink from blue.

23,['4/03/2020'],Are you constantly staring at your phone? Watch out!,"Tamanna Jha (37), financial expert with a stock analyst firm, was on the brink of losing her job, courtesy a culprit that fits into the palm of her hand. The need to constantly check her phone and chat with friends resulted in her being given a stern warning at her workplace last month. Why? She was over-engrossed on her phone, which saw her narrowly miss making a timely assessment of current stocks. “It’s not something I am proud of, but also something I couldn’t help. Reaching for my phone as soon as I get anywhere is like second nature to me and every time it beeps, I have to see what my chat groups are saying,” she admits. “I just missed making a huge loss and have been warned to reduce my phone screen time in office now,” she adds. She’s not the only one. Digital addiction is a growing new-age problem affecting everyone, from professionals to students and even, homemakers. This addiction to the smartphone screen can cost you more than being in troubled waters at just the workplace — it can ruin relationships, cause digital eye strain and up the risk of lifestyle diseases too.The point has been outlined often enough. Terms like a ‘cyber widow’, which describes a woman whose partner can’t be separated from his gadget or even ‘phubbing’ or phone snubbing, only reiterates this. Result? Smartphones continue to contribute to the breakdown of long-term relationships and even play a growing role in divorces. Affirms psychiatrist and counsellor, Dr Pavan Sonar, “We’ve seen at least 50 per cent of cases of disharmony between couples cropping up on account of digital addiction. Often, one partner can’t gauge what the other is doing on screen. We also see intimacy taking a backseat as a fallout of this. It simply holds no priority for people. There is a tendency to always want the phone at hand and to be glued to the screen. This mostly happens in the night hours. ‘Me time’ or ‘we time’ has become screen time and that changes the bedroom dynamics.”Mumbai’s colleges have swung into action to deal with the situation. Says Karina Ailsinghani, SYBA student from Jai Hind College, “Today, we have no network in classes; it’s network-free to try and curb the menace.” The college has a ‘Wellness Cell’, which also helps tackle issues like screen addiction. Says Mahek Punjabi, head of the cell, “We have had experts talk about the ills of screen addiction. It has been seen that those who are depressed use a phone as a form of escape, where their virtual world becomes less lonely to them. They want X number of followers and ape dangerous stunt videos for attention. Stalking also starts early with gadget addiction.”A total phone ban is tough, so colleges are working around the issue. Says Dr Minu Madlani, principal of KPB Hinduja College, “We have to allow it on an experimental basis for degree college students. In some lectures students are asked to surf for information online, making the phone a learning tool. That said, overall there is a definite screen addiction menace and there is an urgent need to reduce that addiction. We also plan to roll out campaigns such as a ‘No Phone Day’, where kids keep the gadgets out and get awarded.”Amisha Mehta, parent to a four-year-old, is a case in point about how the younger kids are unable to look away from digital screens. “My daughter Alina wouldn’t eat breakfast unless we put the phone in front of her. It has become so bad that she cries and refuses to eat unless we do so. We previously gave her the phone to distract her; now she can’t do without it,” she says.Citing the case of such a ‘digital nanny’ Dr Samir H Dalwai, a developmental pediatrician, says, “Parents use a gadget as a means to distract their child to get their work done or a source of entertainment to make up for the missed affection. But this has its risks and parents need to come up with effective alternatives.” The trend of too much screen time in a child’s life has become so rampant that it got him and his team to come up with a #LimitMyScreenTime Campaign last month. He says, “We see many children every day, each with developmental and behavioural concerns. And screen time plays a major role in worsening the situation. According to research, screen use among children aged 0-8 years has exploded over the decade. Currently, an average two-year-old spends up to two hours on a mobile device whereas the American Academy of Pediatrics strictly prohibits use of any screen for children below two years, except it in a supervised video chat. Over a period of time, concerns can arise such as headaches and back pains in older children due to sitting in front of televisions and computers. One of the other major drawbacks of excessive screen time is change in behavior and poor social communication skills. Watching violent and aggressive content which if left unchecked, can lead to similar behavioural changes in children.”Looking down at your cellphone for long hours has its pitfalls— tightness and pain, for one. Says orthopaedic surgeon, Dr Milind Merchant, “The forward bending position of the neck puts pressure on the spine and that causes neck pain.

26,['4/03/2020'],India can hurt Qatar again: Igor Stimac,"Igor Stimac

PANAJI: Igor Stimac ’s best result since taking charge of the Indian team nine months ago is a goalless draw against Asian champions Qatar in Doha. That result put Indian football on cloud nine but were soon brought back to earth with last-minute draws against lowly Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Ahead of the last three games in the Fifa World Cup qualifiers, Stimac explains why he continues to bristle with confidence. Excerpts from an exclusive interview with TOI…

India are now out of the World Cup 2022 race. How confident are you that India can still make it to the Asian Cup 2023?

I am very confident. We have more quality than Bangladesh and Afghanistan, although we need to show that on the field for 90 minutes. We still haven’t found a way to fight with quality in the final third of the pitch. That was our main problem against Afghanistan and Bangladesh, even Oman when, for the first time, we had more ball possession and adopted a different approach to the game.

Are you worried that India are still without a win?

You have to look at the process which cannot make you certain about fulfilling your aim as you wish. There will be sufferings. We are now a team which is very difficult to beat, a team which does not concede too many goals. Whoever is there at the other end, it will be difficult to beat us. I am not saying it will not happen. It may. But it will also show our higher quality. Our next step of training in April and May is to work out in the final third and find a way when we are considered favourites, against teams ranked below us.

India had an excellent draw against Qatar but also frustrating results against Bangladesh and Afghanistan, where the team needed last-minute equalisers…

Equalising at the end of the games confirms the character of this team. It shows we never surrender. We now have a winning mindset and that’s the biggest gain for me in the past few months of our work together. Not winning these games is part of the process. I was aware of the danger (at the back) when we open ourselves and take more risks, but when I look at the number of players missing in the defensive line, I think we still showed quality.

You will continue to miss defensive players. How will you handle that?

It’s going to be very difficult. Once again, we have to field a team which hasn’t played before. We have nine days (during the camp) to find a solution. We need to go with the best conditioned players, the strong ones in terms of mindset and muscle. We also need players with certain technical ability to match Qatar. I have to convince my players that they need to enjoy this game. They need not worry about the result. Just go out, do your best and believe in what we are doing. This match will be a learning experience, particularly for the youngsters. Against Qatar, we need to find a way how we can hurt them. If we took a point off them when they were in their best form, and at home, we certainly have the opportunity now to find a way and hurt them one more time.

Bengaluru FC coach Carles Cuadrat said if he was in your position, he would be worried, pointing to the lack of goals and assists from many important players, particularly the likes of Udanta Singh and Ashique Kuruniyan…

That's nothing new. He should be more worried because he has a playoff to play and get the team to the final. I am the one who should be enjoying the good work of club managers, and not the other way round. With respect to all of them, who I consider friends, we should develop players together. They are the ones who have the chance to work on a daily basis and improve their abilities. I don’t have that joy. I am here to pick up the best players so that they can defend India colours and show to the world they have improved, thanks to their work at the clubs. Udanta and Ashique have been used as examples. I want to remind everyone who point at their lack of goals, just look at their defensive work, how much they have contributed to Bengaluru becoming the best defensive side (in the ISL ) and Gurpreet (Sandhu) having so many clean sheets. These players suffer upfront because they don’t have any time to relax during the game. They need to defend and produce (goals) upfront.

35,['4/03/2020'],"UN body goes to Supreme Court on CAA; ‘internal matter’, says government","CAA reflects our commitment on rights: Government

NEW DELHI: For the first time in India’s judicial history, a United Nations body — the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) — on Tuesday sought to intervene as amicus curiae , or friend of the court, to assist the Supreme Court in adjudicating the constitutional validity of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). The UNHCHR said while CAA has a “worthy and commendable objective”, it appears to discriminate against persecuted Muslim communities.The ministry of external affairs swiftly hit back, saying it was an “internal matter” and that “no foreign party has any locus standi on issues pertaining to India’s sovereignty” and “the Indian Parliament’s right to make law”.Intervening in a petition filed by former Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh Deb Mukharji, who has challenged CAA, UNHCHR Michelle Bachelet Jeria stated, “CAA can potentially benefit thousands of migrants in an irregular situation, including refugees, who might otherwise face obstacles in obtaining protection from persecution in their countries of origin, including through the grant of citizenship. This is commendable.” However, she added, the law “raises a number of issues related to India’s wider human rights obligations in the context of fundamental principle of non-refoulement, that is no forced repatriation of refugees to their home country.”Countering United Nations high commissioner for human rights (UNHCHR) Michelle Bachelet Jeria’s statement against CAA, MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said, “We are clear that CAA is constitutionally valid and complies with all requirements of our constitutional values. It is reflective of our longstanding national commitment in respect of human rights issues arising from the tragedy of the Partition of India.’’“India is a democratic country governed by the rule of law. We all have utmost respect for and full trust in our independent judiciary. We are confident that our sound and legally sustainable position would be vindicated by the Supreme Court,” Kumar added.The government’s reaction came after India’s permanent mission in Geneva was informed by the Office of the UNHCHR that it was filing an intervention plea against CAA in the SC seeking to present itself as an amicus curiae. SC officials could not confirm if the intervention application of Jeira, who was Chi- le’s first woman president, had actually been filed. An official in the registry said, “No UNHCHR application has been filed on Tuesday in Deb Mukharji’s petition.” A spokesperson for the UN body said the high commissioner intended to shortly submit an amicus curiae brief on CAA in the SC in accordance with court’s procedures.Jeria said she and her predecessors “have filed amicus curiae briefs on issues of particular public importance within proceedings before a diverse range of international and national jurisdictions, including at the international level — European Court of Human Rights, Inter-American Court of Human Rights, International Criminal Court — and at national level — US Supreme Court and final appeal courts of States in Asia and Latin America.”She clarified that though she intends to intervene in CAA proceedings as an amicus curiae in the SC, she would not give up her diplomatic privileges and immunity. This means she would not submit to the SC’s jurisdiction and not be liable for any adverse order against her.Referring to CAA promising expeditious citizenship for persecuted minorities, Jeria said, “The factual basis for the arguments provided in the Statement of Objects and Reasons for the introduction of CAB for such preferential treatment, also find support in pronouncements by the UN human rights mechanism regarding the situation of religious minorities in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.”“However, recent reports by the UN human rights treaty bodies, special procedures and other mechanism ascertain that there exist a number of religious groups considered religious minorities in these countries, especially of the Muslim faith, including Ahmadi, Hazara and Shia Muslims whose situations would warrant protection on the same basis as that provided in the preferential treatment proposed by the CAA,” she said. However, the UNHCHR is silent whether it had similarly moved Supreme Courts of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh seeking protection of these groups.“The question also arises as to whether the differentiation made with regard to persecution on religious grounds, as opposed to other grounds, is sufficiently objective and reasonable, in particular taking into account the prohibition of refoulement and India’s obligations under international human rights law,” she said.Referring to India championing the right to ‘equal protection of law’ in 1949 for ‘International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights’, Jeria said, “It is remarkable that after 60 years, this very issue lies at the heart of the SC deliberations as it examines CAA. This presents SC with a historic and unique opportunity to give practical meaning to this fundamental right (equal protection of law) at the domestic level.”While requesting SC to take into account international human rights laws, norms and standards in proceedings relating to CAA, she gave an example of similar interventions by UNHCHR in judicial forums of other countries in human right issues.While a special rapporteur, an independent expert appointed to work on behalf of the UN, had earlier filed a plea in India’s Supreme Court on the Rohingya issue, this is probably the first time a UN body has sought to intervene in the top court on a domestic law.Jeria, who has a background of human rights activism and represented the socialist party in Chile, has been very critical of CAA since it was passed by Parliament in December and also the government’s handling of J&K. Speaking at the 43rd session of the Human Rights Council last week, she expressed concern over reports of police inaction in the face of attacks against Muslims by other groups, as well as previous reports of excessive use of force by police against peaceful protesters.On Kashmir , she had said that while life had been disrupted by heavy military presence, no steps had been taken to address allegations of excessive use of force and other serious human rights violations by security forces.India has in recent weeks pushed back against Turkey, Malaysia and entities of the US Congress for criticising provisions of CAA.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74466802,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-832927,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/un-body-goes-to-supreme-court-on-caa-internal-matter-says-government/articleshow/74466792.cms

NEW DELHI: The logjam in Parliament does not show any sign of easing with the government seeking to schedule a discussion on the riots in Delhi on March 11 after Holi next week and the opposition adamant that the violence be debated before any significant legislative business is taken up.

Attempts to pass the ‘Vivad se Vishwas’ bill, which seeks to provide a resolution to tax disputes that add up to Rs 9.3 lakh crore, failed with just a few clauses passed on in the midst of protests in Lok Sabha on Tuesday afternoon when Congress’s Adhir Ranjan Choudhury vigorously contested the bid to pass the legislation.

As was the case on Monday, opposition and treasury bench members were seen jostling with each other after Speaker Om Birla ’s suggestion to discuss the Delhi riots on March 11, a day after Holi, was rejected. The government said it was willing to discuss the violence at a date set by the Speaker but to do immediately is avoidable since normalcy is just restored.

Rajya Sabha was adjourned thrice and could not transact any business on Tuesday over the opposition's demand for a debate on the Delhi riots. Leader of opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad wondered aloud why the government was adopting double standards by claiming on one hand that the situation in Delhi was normal but insisting that a discussion could not be allowed at present.

Despite Om Birla’s warning on Tuesday morning — that any MP crossing to the other side would be suspended for the remainder of the session — Lok Sabha witnessed dramatic scenes with Chowdhury rushing to the well to protest against the transaction of legislative business.

The Speaker had tried to resolve the standoff when he met opposition leaders in the afternoon. Though non-Congress opposition parties seemed ambivalent, Choudhury is understood to have stuck to his guns. Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi sought to point out that the bill in question needed to be passed before March 31 as it had serious financial implications.

In Rajya Sabha, Azad said, “All of us, whether in the opposition or government, condemn the incidents. That Delhi violence is talked about in foreign countries but not discussed even though Parliament is in session... is a little odd. We are not looking to confront the government. We are all saddened; the victims, be it from any community or religion, were fellow humans. 90% of those dead were in the 24-35 age group. Property and shops were also destroyed,” he said.

Leader of the House Thaawarchand Gehlot got up and said the government was ready for a discussion as per the schedule decided by the Rajya Sabha chairman. The deputy chairman then said the date and time for the discussion would be decided by the chairman.

In Lok Sabha, amid slogans of ‘Down, Down Amit Shah ’ and ‘Save our India’, opposition MPs tore up papers even as Om Birla allowed finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to introduce the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2020. Though Lok Sabha passed six clauses of the ‘Vivad se Vishwas’ tax resolution bill amid the ensuing din, it could not pass the bill because of the ruckus that followed.

As Congress, TMC, SP and DMK MPs rushed into the well, BJP MP Locket Chatterjee attempted to prevent Chowdhury from moving towards the treasury benches. As Congress MPs rushed behind Chowdhury, BJP MPs Nishikant Dubey , Ravi Shankar Prasad and Jagdambika Pal rushed in to defuse tensions, but heated exchanges followed, forcing Om Birla to adjourn the House for the day around 2.15 pm.

Amid the din, BJP and Congress members pushed each other while some were seen banging the swivel door leading to the secretary general’s desk. Slanging matches and sloganeering continued even after the House was adjourned. Women and child development minister Smriti Irani engaged in a war of words with Congress MPs K Suresh and Benny Behanan over banging the secretary general’s door.

Even as opposition parties demanded that PM Narendra Modi address the House and called for Shah’s resignation, the Speaker strongly opposed waving of placards and banners. He asked Congress, “Please say it as a party... do you want Parliament to be run with placards and banners... say so.”

Jammu

and Kashmir'

NEW DELHI/ SRINAGAR : Days after the NIA arrested an overground Jaish worker who drove the Pulwama suicide bomber to the attack site, a father-daughter duo has landed in the agency’s net for allegedly facilitating and sheltering terror conspirators involved in the February 14, 2019, strike that killed 40 CRPF personnel.Tariq Ahmed Shah, 50, a resident of Hakripora village in Pulwama, and his daughter Insha Jan, 23, are accused of having harboured suicide bomber Adil Ahmad Dar , Pakistani terrorists Umer Farooq and Kamran (both killed in subsequent encounters with security forces in J&K), Jaish terrorist from Pulwama Sameer Ahmad Dar and another Pakistani terrorist Mohd Ismail, at their residence.The NIA claimed that Tariq Shah, a tipper truck driver in south Kashmir, admitted that his Hakripora house was used to shelter the terrorists as they planned the attack on the CRPF convoy. It was at his house that the video of Dar, released by Jaish after the Pulwama attack, was recorded before the attack, the agency claimed.Insha Jan provided the terrorists food and other logistics during their stay in 2018-19 on more than 15 occasions, each lasting two to four days, the NIA said.Initial interrogation revealed that Insha was in constant touch with Umar Farooq, the Pakistani IED maker, and was in communication with him over telephone and social media platforms, the agency claimed.Tuesday’s arrests come on the heels of the first big breakthrough with the arrest of Jaish overground worker Shakir Bashir Magrey, a resident of Hajibal in Kakapora , Pulwama. Magrey, as per the NIA, had driven Adil Dar to a point 500 metres short of the attack site. He had also helped secure material for the IED used in the attack and is said to have ordered ammonium powder, batteries and gloves from Amazon.As per sources, the Shah family comprising Tariq and Insha had earlier given shelter to Abu Dujana, slain Pakistani Lashkar-e-Taiba commander, during 2017-2018. They added that Tariq Shah was involved in ferrying terrorists from the Wagah border and was the main conduit of funds for terrorists operating in the Kashmir Valley.Dujana was killed in the vicinity of Hakripora, 13km from Pulwama town on July 13, 2018, after he deserted Insha and developed a relationship with another woman in a nearby village . It is also believed that Insha informed the police about Dujana’s presence in that house with another woman.Reports said the NIA, accompanied by police and CRPF, raided Tariq Shah’s residence early on Tuesday. Both, Tariq and Insha, were taken to the nearest police station before being handed over to an NIA team.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74466981,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-437323,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/girl-and-father-held-for-aiding-pulwama-bomber/articleshow/74466979.cms

DEHRADUN: Nitika Kaul, widow of Major Vibhuti Dhoundiyal , who was killed in a military operation after the Pulwama terror attack, is all set to join the technical wing of the Indian Army .

Kaul, 26, currently working with a software company in Noida, has cleared the Army’s entrance exam ( Services Selection Board ) and also received a call letter from the Officers Training Academy , Chennai, her family members told TOI on Tuesday. Since her husband was killed in action, she was given a relaxation in age limit to appear in the recruitment test.

A video of Nitika bidding a tearful adieu to her husband was widely circulated on social media last year in which she was seen giving a message to her husband before he was laid to rest — “You said you loved me, but the fact is you loved the nation more… I’ll love you till my last breath. I owe my life to you.” Almost a year after Major Dhoundiyal was killed, Kaul is set to serve in the Army.

Hope I get opportunity to serve India the way my husband did: Nitika

Saroj Dhoundiyal, Kaul’s mother-in-law, told TOI that she is very happy for her daughter-in-law. “She is a brave girl and takes care of us like a daughter. We are glad to have her in our lives,” she said, adding that she was the first to get the news of Kaul getting the offer letter. “It feels great that she put me above her own parents and called me first,” she said.

Talking to TOI on the first death anniversary of her husband on February 18, Kaul had said, “I couldn’t resist myself to love what my husband loved the most. I hope even I will get an opportunity to serve the country the way he did.” Nitika and Vibhuti had met while in college and had got married in April 2018. A few months before their first wedding anniversary, Major Dhoundiyal was killed while taking part in an operation in J&K to flush out militants after the Pulwama attack.

Kaul, a Kashmiri Pandit who moved to Delhi in the 1990s, said that her mother-in-law motivated her to join the Army. “Every time I see her, I see a hero. Her grief is no less, still she supported me throughout,” said Kaul, who has an MBA in marketing operations.

44,['4/03/2020'],"With Vande Mataram stand, PM Narendra Modi tries to corner opposition on ‘nationalism’","PM Narendra Modi (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Raising the nationalism bar higher, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday took on his predecessor Manmohan Singh and others opposing the raising of ‘ Vande Mataram ’ and ‘ Bharat Mata ki Jai ’ slogans and said it was painful to see continuing resistance to chants dedicated to the motherland.

Referring to Singh’s recent criticism of what he called the misuse of ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ slogans, Modi said, “It is strange and sad that a former prime minister sniffs foul play even in a slogan like 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' and looks at it with suspicion.”

At a recent event, Singh had said the slogan of 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' was being misused to construct a “militant and purely emotional” idea of India that excluded millions of citizens.

Addressing the BJP parliamentary party meeting, Modi said he was aghast to see opposition to ‘Vande Mataram’ and ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ even after 70 years of freedom. “Singing of ‘Vande Mataram’ used to be opposed before independence but it is painful to see people having quarrel with chants dedicated to the motherland even 70 years after the country became free,” a source quoted the PM as telling BJP MPs.

“In the closed-door meetings of Congress, similar controversies were created over 'Vande Mataram' during the freedom struggle and singing it was adjudged to be a ‘gunah’ (crime) with many people choosing to leave meetings of the Congress when it was played,” the source quoted the PM as saying.

“It is unfortunate and sad that 70 years after independence, raising a slogan like 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' is being depicted as a crime... It is equally unfortunate that a person who held the post of prime minister is saying so,” Modi said and added that such a view would disappoint and hurt any citizen of the country.

The PM’s remarks acquire significance also in that they come against the backdrop of the anti-CAA protesters displaying the national flag at their sit-ins — something which has been interpreted as an attempt to weaken BJP’s hold over the “nationalism” plank.

Modi’s speech is an indication that BJP is not just unwilling to let others freely grab a slice of its plank. It marked a challenge to opponents to take the game to a level where it would be uncomfortable. The opposition is not enthusiastic about Vande Mataram out of respect to the sensibilities of Muslims. The minority community has been opposed to the singing of Vande Mataram — the popular anthem of the the freedom struggle — on the ground that it represents idolatry. The community also did not warm up to Bharat Mata ki Jai for the same reason.

The resistance was one of the main reasons why Jana Gana Mana and not Vande Mataram was selected as the national anthem. Though the lines from Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyaya ’s iconic Anand Math were consecrated as the national song, the post-independence phase saw its progressive diminution.

For the BJP, Vande Mataram and Bharat Mata ki Jai have been an integral part of its imagination of nationhood. Under Modi, the two symbols loom even larger, with the PM beginning his speeches with Bharat Mata ki Jai. His rallies are marked by full-throated invocations of Vande Mataram.

In his first public meeting after the enactment of the CAA , Modi had noted the use of the national flag in protests against the new citizenship law to say that he expected the heartening spectacle to be followed through by similar respect for national symbols in all situations.

Addressing BJP MPs, Modi suggested that the opposition to Vande Mataram and Bharat Mata ki Jai had cast a greater responsibility on BJP workers. “There are some parties for whom political interests are supreme but for us national interest is of utmost importance,” the PM said, adding that some forces were working to destabilise the country, which should be countered with the same strength.

“It is unfortunate that the country has been divided in two sides of ‘desh hit’ (nation’s interest) and ‘dal hit’ (party’s interest). However, we BJP workers will have to strive for the nation and make it a winner,” Modi said, adding such a commitment to the nation can be fulfilled only with complete dedication.

Quoting the PM, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said, “Vikas (development) is our mantra and peace, harmony and unity are prerequisites for the country's development. We should not merely speak about it but take the lead in ensuring peace, harmony and unity.”

The expanded reservoir on river Sone would provide assured irrigation facility to the districts like Rohtas, Kaimur, Bhojpur, Buxar, Aurangabad, Arwal, Gaya and Patna.

Jha said work on the expansion of the reservoir would require the consent and cooperation from the governments of Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh, as well as necessary clearances from the central bodies like Central Water Commission (CWC), Jal Shakti and Union forest and climate change ministries.

The minister was giving the government’s reply to the call attention question of several members, including Sudama Prasad, Satyadeo Ram and Mahboob Alam from CPI(ML), Mohammad Nematullah, Rahul Tiwari and Bhai Birendra from RJD and Ramdeo Rai from Congress, among others. They asked as to when the work would begin on the construction of the Kadwan dam.

Jha said the then CM had laid the foundation for the construction of Kadwan dam in 1990, but it remained confined to the files and exchange of letters with the officials concerned.

Later on February 14, 2017, CM Nitish Kumar held a detailed review meeting on the matter at Matianw village in Nauhatta block of Rohtas district to explore the ways to make the project feasible. In-depth discussions were held on various aspects related to Kadwan dam, including the interstate matters.

It was decided to rename the Kadwan dam project as Indrapuri Reservoir Project following the cabinet approval on June 28, 2017, besides on the preparation of the detailed report for administrative sanction to it. The consultant roped in to prepare the DPR started the work on August 28 the same year, Jha said.

He added that the consultancy firm had almost completed the work related to different aspects of the project and it was also ready to submit the required DPR. However, the consents of the UP and Jharkhand governments, besides clearances from the central government bodies would also be required before starting the expansion work on the reservoir.

For, the expansion of the reservoir would submerge ryoti land in Jharkhand, while the supply of water through Sone river has to be increased and kept steady by the UP government, Jha said.

48,['4/03/2020'],Check affiliation status of schools: CBSE,"PATNA: As the new academic session is set to start from next month, the Central Board of Secondary Education ( CBSE ) has cautioned parents against admitting their kids to non-affiliated schools.

According to sources, the CBSE has noticed that some non-affiliated schools are misleading parents with their affiliated status. Many, whose affiliations are under process or rejected by the Board, are providing them with wrong information.

In a statement issued on Monday, CBSE secretary Anurag Tripathi said, “As per clause 14.2.2 of its Affiliation Bye-Laws, 2018, the CBSE does not allow candidates of non-affiliated schools to appear for the Board exams. Therefore, parents, who wish to admit their ward (s) to CBSE schools, are alerted and requested to check their affiliation status first.”

CBSE’s city coordinator and principal of Baldwin Academy, Rajiv Ranjan Sinha, told this newspaper on Tuesday that the Board had taken the step to stop flying and non-attending students from writing the exams of classes X and XII.

“Parents can check a school’s affiliation status on www.cbseaff.nic.in before admitting their kids there. If they want to know whether a school has applied for affiliation, they can contact the regional office as well,” Sinha said.

At present, there are 943 CBSE-affiliated schools in Bihar, including 178 in Patna.

Bihar Public School and Children Welfare Association chairman D P Singh pointed out that over 400 schools in the state capital claimed to be affiliated to the CBSE.

“Most of them have tied up with affiliated schools so that their students can write the Board exams as flying candidates. This practice is wrong,” he said.

Gyan Niketan Boys’ School vice-principal Shailendra Mohan Jha hailed the CBSE’s decision. He said, “It is good that the Board has taken an initiative to alert the parents about the affiliation of schools. Parents need to take the right decision for their wards.”

For the last three years, the authorities had been telling us that they had applied for affiliation, but nothing happened. I have, therefore, decided to send my son to a CBSE-affiliated school.”

49,['4/03/2020'],"SC annuls Orchid Pharma sale plea, Accord Life suffers setback","Chennai: The Supreme Court (SC) has set aside the injunction order of National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) which stayed the sale of Orchid Pharma to Dhanuka Labs citing the bid price was lower than liquidation value.

The NCLAT stay was granted in response to a petition filed by Accord Life Spec Private Ltd., a company promoted by DMK MP Jagatrakshagan’s family members.

It also ordered that SBI be impleaded in the case as one of the respondents. SBI moved the apex court and sought quashing of the NCLAT injunction.

Pursuant to the ongoing Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP), we hereby inform that the appeal filed before the SC was disposed of on February 28, 2020. “Accordingly, the appeal filed in SC was allowed and the judgement of the NCLAT was set aside,” Orchid said in a stock exchange filing.

The Court said, “No provision in the Code (IBC) or Regulations has been brought to our notice under which the bid of any Resolution Applicant has to match liquidation value.”

The Chennai bench of NCLT approved the resolution plan of Dhanuka Laboratories for Rs 570 crore, to take over Orchid Pharma under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).

The liquidation value was Rs 1309 crore.

The resolution plan of Dhanuka Laboratories was lower than Orchid Pharma’s liquidation value of Rs 1,309 crore. The bench noted that it was more concerned about the 1,407 employees of Orchid Pharma, who were eking their livelihood by working in this company.

This was the second bid for Orchid that faced a regulatory bump. Ingen capital submitted a bid for Rs 1000 crore, but failed to bring in the funds which resulted in the collapse of the transaction. The RP was ordered by the NCLAT to call for fresh bids, which resulted in Dhanuka getting the nod.

50,['4/03/2020'],"India Inc not covered, but insurers could be hit","Mayur Shetty | TNN

Mumbai: Most corporates have no insurance protection against coronavirus, since an add-on cover for business interruption has been avoided by them. Insurance brokers are now asking corporate clients to re-examine their policies in light of the new risks.

“The property insurance in India and globally excludes the non-damage risk for business interruption,” said Sanjay Kedia , MD of Marsh India, the world’s largest insurance broking firm. In India, business interruption cover is sold in the form of a ‘loss of profit’ policy, which provides compensation for a shutdown of plant and machinery.

“Only specialised insurance products which are not common may have non-damage insurance for a business interruption for businesses. So, most corporates who have supply chain risk issues due to coronavirus are currently exposed to this risk and losses,” said Kedia. For individuals, their medical insurance policies generally cover all hospitalisations, barring those excluded. Insurers are also likely to face liability on account of claims due to event cancellations.

According to Mohan C R, national head of property and risk management at Bajaj Allianz General Insurance , most of the ‘loss of profit’ policies will not be covering supply disruptions due to the virus outbreak. “However, there could be a business impact if there is a damage claim and replacement parts are to be sourced from China,” he said. In such a situation, the insurance company can help the company to source the parts from other markets where they might be available even if it is at a slightly higher price.

Employers also face liability risks if any action of theirs results in the spread of the virus. This could include liability towards employees. According to a report on pandemics by Marsh, businesses face several potential risks. These include loss of workforce due to death & illness, operational disruptions, reduced customer demand and reputational damage.Ratings agency Moody’s said that the impact of the coronavirus on global insurers would be only through second-order effects. In other words, they will lose money because of the fall in the value of investments coupled with lower business due to a slowdown. However, there will be some impact on reinsurers.

“We expect coronavirus-related critical illness claims to be limited because the Chinese government has undertaken to cover the cost of care and treatment for those affected. This is positive for the two biggest reinsurers, Munich Re and Swiss Re,” Moody’s said. Insurance cover that would be triggered by the death of the insured (‘mortality’ business) accounted for only 40% and 42% of Munich Re and Swiss Re’s Asian life and health exposure respectively in 2018. This limits potential claims impact in the event of deaths related to the coronavirus outbreak escalating, said Moody’s.

51,['4/03/2020'],"RBI, global central banks act to counter virus impact","Mayur Shetty | TNN

Mumbai: The RBI on Tuesday promised “appropriate action” to maintain market confidence, helping the sensex break its seven-day losing streak and close 480 points higher. The rupee, however, breached the 73 level to close 57 paise lower at 73.30 against the dollar over fears that global investors will turn risk-averse and move out of emerging markets.

The central bank issued a statement on Tuesday afternoon as the spread of the coronavirus was triggering risk-off sentiments and flights to safe havens. Worldwide, central banks are taking coordinated action to mitigate the economic impact of coronavirus. The RBI’s statement came ahead of a 50-basis-point (100bps = 1 percentage point) cut in rates by the US Federal Reserve . The Fed said that its benchmark funds rate will now be targeted in a range between 1% and 1.25%. Earlier, the Reserve Bank of Australia had also cut rates to a record low of 0.5%.

In its statement, the RBI added that spillover of this volatility into the Indian financial markets has been contained and hopes of a coordinated policy action has boosted market sentiment. “The RBI is monitoring global and domestic developments closely and continuously and stands ready to take appropriate actions to ensure orderly functioning of financial markets, maintain market confidence and preserve financial stability,” the banking regulator said.

The sensex rose 480 points, or 1.3%, to end at 38,624, while the broader NSE Nifty jumped 170 points, or 1.5%, up to close at 11,303. “Releasing liquidity would be a quick fix to support the equity markets, but it cannot address the drop in economic activity,” said Ashish Vaidya , head of trading at DBS. He added that a risk-off situation (where global funds retreat to safe havens) would impact the rupee as India still has some macro weaknesses. He said the outlook would depend on the impact on corporate balance sheets and how long it is prolonged.

“We have not seen retail demand drop for foreign currency, but there has been a considerable decline in purchase of currencies for Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesian rupiah as there is a drop in travel to these destinations,” said Hariprasad M P, head of business and treasury at Ebixcash World Money. He added the rupee has been holding firm against the dollar for some time even as other currencies have been weakening. “The market volatility on account of coronavirus has helped the rupee break out of the resistance level.”

Dealers said the market had factored in a rate cut by the US Fed. “If a rate cut materialises, it would push yields on 10-year US bonds below 1%, and put more pressure on the rupee,” said a dealer before the US Fed cut later in the day.

“The entire premise of the rupee being likely to outperform other Asian and emerging market currencies goes for a toss if new coronavirus cases are detected in India. While the rupee has been tracking the yuan and other Asian currencies, it moved out of whack today. Despite other Asian currencies being steady, the rupee weakened,” said Abhishek Goenka , founder, IFA Global . “If the situation onshore deteriorates further, triggering an exodus from domestic stocks and bonds, we could see the rupee weaken to test previous lows of around 74.50 against the US dollar very quickly,” he added.

52,['4/03/2020'],ArcelorMittal buys Hazira power plant,"Reeba Zachariah | TNN

Mumbai: ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel (AMNS) has acquired a 500MW power plant from Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company for Rs 500 crore.

The natural gas-based power plant in Hazira, Gujarat, serves as a captive to AMNS’ recently acquired Essar Steel. The power plant and Essar Steel were founded by the Ruias of Essar Group but they lost the two companies after they failed to honour debt obligations. The acquisition of the power plant by AMNS comes days after it was selected the preferred bidder for an iron ore mine licence in Odisha after an auction process facilitated by the state government.

The Thakurani block in the district of Keonjhar, with estimated reserves of 179 million tonnes, and the Bhander power plant in Hazira helps AMNS secure long-term raw material requirements for Essar Steel. AMNS had acquired Essar Steel for Rs 42,000 crore in December, marking its foray into India’s metal sector.

On Tuesday, the NCLT-Cuttack approved AMNS’ Rs 2,300-crore offer for Odisha Slurry Pipeline Infrastructure, another important ancillary unit for the company. The 253km pipeline connects Essar Steel’s iron ore beneficiation plant in Dabuna to its pellet plant in Paradip, Odisha. Pellet, a raw material feed for the steel unit, is shipped to Hazira.

53,['4/03/2020'],Pre-BS6 buying has not happened so post April demand should not contract: VECV CEO,"Chennai: The truck market has seen the worst sales in February with the month volume down more than the 11-month average, yet Volvo expects better days for the industry from April as the expected pre-buying has not happened. In a chat with TOI, Vinod Aggarwal, MD & CEO, Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles talks about why pre-buying before BS6 cutoff did not materialise and what it means for the truck market. Excerpts:

The truck market was betting big on pre-buying before March 31 since the price differential between BS4 and BS6 trucks is substantial. But that isn't happening, is it?

Yes, we were expecting some pre-buying but the February sales figures show no pre-buying is happening at all. The sales drop in February was worse than earlier months with the 16 tonne plus category witnessing a 51% drop in sales. In the 5-15 tonne category, the drop was 37%.

Why did the expected pre-buying not happen?

There is a lot of conservatism from financiers — they want to be sure that the vehicle will get registered post body-building and if there is any doubt they are not financing. OEMs don’t want to stock BS4 vehicles and so we are being conservative and dealers too are cautious about stocking BS4 vehicles.

What will the price differential be on VECV’s BS6 range?

Price increase will be in the range of 8%-15% for heavy duty and light-medium duty range. It will be highest in light duty and lowest in heavy duty.

Without the pre-buying how will the truck market perform post April?

If pre-buying is not there, the contraction of the demand post March 31 will not be that much. The replacements have to happen and hopefully things should be normal. Earlier we thought there will be pre-buying so the truck market will contract April onwards. But that’s not happening. So things should be normal.

Is the LCV market faring better?

Only slightly better. The sub 3.5 tonne segment is down 11% YTD.

PATNA: With a view to minimizing the use of conventional sources of energy, Patna University (PU) will soon install solar panels on the rooftops of all the buildings on its campus. This was announced by vice-chancellor (VC) Rash Bihari Prasad Singh while initiating a discussion on the ‘Utility of Solar Energy ’ organized as part of ‘Jal-Jivan-Hariyali Diwas’ celebrations at the Wheeler Senate House on Tuesday.

The state education department has issued a directive to all the universities and colleges to observe the first Tuesday of every month as ‘Jal-Jivan-Hariyali Diwas’. Hence, various programmes were conducted at the university level and in different colleges on the theme of energy conservation.

The VC pointed out that the university had also started constructing rainwater harvesting structures at different places on the campus. “PU students are being made aware of the steps aimed at conserving energy and groundwater level,” he said.

Bihar Renewable Energy Development Agency (BREDA) project officer Surendra Kumar claimed that a solar panel of 236kW had already been installed in PU and more such installations were in the pipeline. Using a PowerPoint presentation, he gave valuable tips on conservation of energy and advantages of the use of solar power.

PU National Service Scheme (NSS) programme coordinator Atul Aditya Pandey pointed out that all the NSS camps organized in different colleges were now based on the theme of ‘Jal-Jivan-Hariyali’. “Young volunteers are being told about ecological balance and environmental conservation,” he added.

PU has decided to organize a poster competition-cum-exhibition for students at the Wheeler Senate House on April 7. A daylong seminar will also be conducted on the first Tuesday of May. The university has already constituted a committee for executing these programmes. Proctor Rajneesh Kumar has been made the professor-in-charge and two teachers — Bhavuk Sharma of geology department and Manoj Prabhakar of economics department — will assist him.

55,['4/03/2020'],E-tailers to rejig supply chains on shortage fears,"(Representative image)

BENGALURU: India’s two largest e-tailers Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart are scrambling to minimise the effect of Covid-19 on the supply chains for two of their largest categories — smartphones and large appliances. These account for about half of their sales, four people aware of the matter said. The virus would start affecting availability of consumer goods on these platforms by mid-April, and might even lead to an increase in prices, the sources added.

Both Flipkart and Amazon, through their private labels like MarQ, AmazonBasics and Solimo, also sell large appliances here that are in high demand at the onset of summer. The e-tailers rely heavily on China for manufacturing. Now smartphone launches slated later in the summer are predicted to be delayed.

Another cause of concern is the fact that many of the established large appliance brands are from South Korea, which is one of the worst affected countries outside China. These companies are now trying to tap new markets to plug the supply delay from China, while asking sellers to supply goods for their own private labels instead of selling them as a third-party brand.

“We are tapping into California, and gradually within India to source goods. For mobile accessories, the price difference is about 25% higher compared to China,” a seller who sources goods from China said. He supplies to both Amazon and Flipkart, and added that the platforms are now asking him to sell most of his inventory as they look to increase reserves. “The idea is to stock as much as possible for these brands in advance (to brace for the dip in supply),” he added. The impact is likely to be felt beyond just horizontal companies selling discretionary items. Bigbasket CEO Hari Menon said he has started sourcing home and kitchen goods from within India at a higher cost.

While e-tailers are yet to pass on the higher cost of products to consumers, goods reaching India will take longer, triggering limited availability. Typically, it takes around 20 days for goods to come from China, depending on the location of these factories. “It can take as much as a month or even longer, provided factories start re-opening, which is also doubtful,” the person mentioned earlier said.

“For Amazon, the problem is not just about India as almost 50% of their sellers are from China. At some point in time, Walmart will also feel it (the problem). As of now, companies are not in a position to pass on the increased cost to consumers because they are thinking many times before spending online,” said Satish Meena, senior forecast analyst at market research firm Forrester.

Both Flipkart and Amazon said they are tracking developments related to the virus. Amazon said it is taking appropriate steps as needed, while Flipkart said it is in touch with its seller partners. “But we have not yet started seeing any major impact at this moment,” a Flipkart spokesperson added.

Another person said a clearer picture would emerge by next month. “As of now, there is enough inventory. But, given the fast expansion of the virus outside China now, a lot of payments and agreements between manufacturers and buyers would get stuck, take longer to materialise, and that would adversely impact pricing for private labels,” said a senior executive at an e-commerce firm. He highlighted how AmazonBasics had aggressively forayed into selling ACs, refrigerators last year in India.

KOLHAPUR: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) has said that it will focus on the restoration of main roads through Rs 8 crore funds which will be sanctioned by Paschim Maharashtra Devasthan Samiti (PMDS) and disaster management fund of the district administration.

The activists met civic authorities on Tuesday to discuss the delays in the restoration of roads damaged due to floods and heavy rain last year. The activists said that most of the Rs 12 crore funds pledged by several people and establishments for restoring the damaged roads have not yet been released.

The pledged funds include those promised by the PMDS, the allocation through disaster management funds and promises made by public representatives. During the meeting, the officials claimed that the funds of Rs 75 lakh promised by the MP’s and MLA’s have been spent to restore the internal roads of the city.

Netradip Sarnobat, chief city engineer, said, “Most of the works of restoring small roads have been completed. The contractors have completed re-building 19 roads. We have also carried out the patchwork. However, we are yet to get the funds from PMDS. We are told that the proposal have been submitted to the state’s law department which is the authority to grant the release of the funds from the corpus of PMDS.”

Sarnobat said that he expects Rs 3 crore grant from district fund to be released by next Monday.

On the other hand, activists have said that the contractors have not carried out the re-building of the roads properly. They demanded that the officials should inspect the work. Responding to the same, Sarnobat said that he will ask the divisional ward engineers to inspect the quality of the work in a week.

PATNA: Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi said in the state assembly on Tuesday that the next of kin of a person who dies due to snakebite in a normal situation will get ex gratia payment of Rs 5 lakh from the forest department, if an application is filed and necessary documents are furnished to the department to back the claim. However, other conditions would apply in cases of death due to snakebite in an area affected by floods.

Modi was giving the government’s reply to the short-notice question of BJP member Sanjay Sarawagi, who claimed that hundreds of persons had died due to snakebite but could not get the ex gratia payment for various reasons, even though snake has been put under the wildlife category.

Modi said snake, indeed, has been put under the wild life category and also that ex gratia payment is made to persons who die in an attack from wild animals, which, otherwise, have been put under the Wildlife Protection Act. He cited the case of Banka district, where persons died in an attack from elephant or even a tiger in the past had been paid ex gratia of Rs5 lakh in case of death.

He said an FIR has to be also filed and the postmortem report on the deceased has to be also procured to claim the ex gratia payment. Modi clarified that another set of conditions would apply if a person dies due to snakebite in any area affected by floods. The ex gratia payment in such a case would be paid by the DM from the state disaster relief fund.

Replying to the short-notice question of RJD member Lalit Kumar Yadav, education minister Krishnanandan Prasad Verma said 329 of the 534 posts of block education officers (BEOs) in the state were vacant. The process for filling the vacant BEO posts would start from April this year, the minister said, adding that Bihar Public Service Commission ( BPSC ) would provide the names to be appointed as BEOs.

“BPSC is in the process to select 455 candidates for appointment as lecturers. The spare candidates who have not been selected for the post of lecturers would be pooled in by the education department to appoint them as BEOs, so as to fill all the vacant posts,” Verma said.

In reply to the starred question of JD(U) member Birendra Kumar Singh, Verma said the management executive committee of the upgraded high schools would be constituted in the next one month. It would be on the same pattern as of the management committees of the existing high schools.

Citing the latest report of the Centre while replying to the question of BJP MLC Krishna Kumar Singh during the question hour in legislative council, Pandey said the highest number of women opting for Antara were from Bihar, followed by Rajasthan.

Pandey said the state’s fertility rate was 4.3 in 2005, which has now come down to 3.2 as per Sample Registration System 2017. “The state government is making efforts to reduce fertility rate continuously by implementing ‘Mission Parivar Vikas ’ in 37 districts, excluding Patna, where the fertility rate was 3 or above,” he said.

“The health department organized ‘population stabilization pakhwada’ on July 11 on the World Population Day and ‘vasectomy pakhwada’ on World Vasectomy Day for two months,” he added.

The minister, in response to question of RJD leader Ram Chandra Purbey about the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) index of Niti Aayog, said Bihar ranked 28 with 50 points. “The state score has improved on several parameters as per the report, which is based on 17 different parameters,” he said.

Pandey said Viral Research and Diagnostic Lab has been established at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) for the test of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). “Besides, the paediatric department of PMCH treats the patients suffering from AES,” he said.

“Advance Molecular Microbiology and Molecular Genomics Lab is being established at Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), Patna. Besides the research on virus-borne diseases, the experts will also diagnose the causes of AES and related ailments. The lab will be operational by May this year,” he said.

PATNA: Agriculture minister Prem Kumar said in the state assembly on Tuesday that the state government would ensure home delivery of high-breed seeds of various crops to farmers through Bihar State Seeds Development Corporation (BSSDC). It will start with the ‘garma’ variety of paddy cropping season.

He said the home delivery of high-breed seeds to farmers was implemented successfully as a pilot project during the Rabi season in Banka district. Accordingly, the decision has been taken to replicate it in other districts during the forthcoming cropping season.

For this, the required money was in the process of being given to BSSDC, he said, adding that the seeds will be made available at lower than the market prices.

The minister was giving the government’s reply to the House debate on the budgetary demand worth Rs3,152 crore of his department for the 2020-21 fiscal. The allotted sum includes the scheme amount (plan expenditure) worth Rs2,395 crore and the committed expenditure (non-plan fund) worth Rs757 crore.

While the cut motion had been moved by RJD member Lalit Kumar Yadav, the House passed the agriculture department budget by voice vote, even as the opposition members led by leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav staged a walkout.

The minister said the state made a great headway in increasing the production and productivity of such crops as paddy, wheat, maize and coarse grains under the leadership of CM Nitish Kumar for which the state was given Krishi Karman Award by the Centre on four occasions. Farming activities were done in a planned manner under the overarching guidelines provided by Bihar agriculture road map envisioned by the CM, Prem also said.

From the 2019-20 financial year, arrangement was made for the supply of seeds to farmers on the basis of their demand made online. The department launched a portal for that, the minister said, adding that in accordance with the online demands made by the farmers for seeds, district agriculture officers allotted the quota of seeds to their sellers.

Prem also said during the 2019-20 Rabi cropping season, slightly over 3.03 lakh quintals of high-breed seeds were made available to 6.48 lakh farmers in accordance with their online demand. The home delivery system is the next step after that, as e-Bhavans had been made in 447 out of 534 blocks in the state.

The injured in the head-on collision were identified as Arvind Das (40) and Pawan Kumar (28), both residents of Supaul. They were taken to the Supaul Sadar hospital from where they were referred to a Siliguri hospital.

The deceased were identified as Md. Shahid (21), Amit Kumar Singh (25) and Golu Kumar (35). Two of them died at the spot while the third victim succumbed on the way to the sadar hospital.

According to Supaul Sadar SHO Sandip Kumar Singh, the accident took place on the Supaul-Singheshwar Sthan Road when the five were returning to Supaul from a wedding ceremony in Madhepura district in an SUV.

“The car was at a high speed when the driver failed to spot the bus coming from opposite direction as there was poor visibility on the road due to fog,” the SHO said.

He blamed high speed and poor visibility for the accident. Both the bus and the SUV were badly damaged. However, none of the passengers in the bus were injured. The vehicle was carrying members of a wedding party to Madhepura from Supaul.

In another incident, two youths-- Ankit Kumar and Shaurabh Kumar--were crushed to death by a speeding bus near Manganj under Jadia police station in the district. The deceased were stated to be residents of Phulkaha village in Supaul district.

62,['4/03/2020'],India Inc yet to walk the talk on gender diversity,"- By Sujaya Banerjee

When the Companies Act 2013 regulation mandated the appointment of at least one woman director on the boards of listed companies, we went about providing this opportunity to the handful of senior women leaders available. Of these, one well qualified woman was finally appointed onto the board of the flagship organisation.

She had over 25 years of experience and was leading an expert function at the time of the appointment. She attended two board meetings, after which the dismayed CEO and one other director sought to speak to us about her worrisome performance. They were concerned as she had not spoken a single word throughout both meetings.

We asked the woman director how she felt about her contributions, and she admitted the discussions in the room were too intense and male-dominated, where aggressive people wouldn’t let her get a word in. She struggled to find a voice, leave aside make meaningful contributions. In private conversations, she further revealed how her upbringing in a conservative family did not permit her to assert in the presence of men, especially in the middle of animated discussions.

We intervened with coaching and getting her support from the CEO — and this issue did eventually settle down. But the point to note is that this is not an uncommon experience for women who make it to the insides of a board room.

In fact, there are several experiences and stories of being marginalised on assignments, outshouted in meetings, being interrupted and not heard. Worse, still not being invited to meetings at all. I am talking about the 15-17% women who do make it to the mid to senior levels within Indian organisations, but struggle with being included.

Asserting in the presence of a male authority, networking in a male bastion without being misunderstood and, most of all, feeling under-confident and not supported are common challenges experienced by women. While there are exceptions, as a few do work around these challenges, this is predominantly still a work-in-progress area for women in Indian workplaces.

A ‘JobsForHer DivHERsity Benchmarking’ report showed last year that several companies are making investments in initiatives to hire, retain and advance women at the workplace. But India’s female labour force participation remains one of the lowest in the world at 26% against a global average of 49%. Additionally, with social norms, patriarchal mindsets and gender roles expectations playing a defining role in dissuading women from pursuing careers seriously, gender diversity is still nascent in most companies in India.

More recently, the idea of women equality, empowerment and inclusion is beginning to appeal to many employers. However, there is little action on the ground, unless mandated by boards or by regulations. Having said that, women returnee programmes for some Indian companies have surged from 10% to 78% in a survey of 300 companies. Many companies invest in mentoring, engagement and recruitment initiatives to strive for an ‘employer of choice’ status among women professionals. But gender wage gaps continue to be discouraging, with women being paid on an average 34% less than their male counterparts.

Today’s ‘Always-on, always-available’ workplace culture appears to be a key factor in holding back gender diversity, especially at mid to senior levels. Individuals often prioritise work over family, personal commitments and well-being to rise to the top. Men are maybe more predisposed to making the trade-offs, while women end up picking the slack in household and other non-work responsibilities, thereby disadvantaging themselves and being unavailable to deliver and participate in the ‘Always-on, always-available’ expectation.

Research shows that even the presence of physical diversity results in better performance. However, when it comes to gender diversity and inclusion, making change has been agonisingly slow. Women overall continue to be undervalued, work more number of hours and have fewer choices.

The privileged English-speaking, urban, educated, financially independent woman in the Indian workplace struggles against stereotypes & biases and expectations of communal behaviour associated with being a woman. These include being affectionate, helpful, friendly, kind, sympathetic, gentle and soft-spoken. Compare this to the agentic behaviour associated with men and leadership effectiveness — assertiveness, being aggressive, dominant, self-confident, forceful, self-reliant and individualistic. Women leaders find themselves in a double bind of confusion that causes people to be more resistant to a woman’s influence than that of men.

Fear of failure and the imposter syndrome is another commonly experienced phenomenon that causes impediments in the journeys of women at work. The imposter syndrome is a debilitating phenomenon — a mixture of anxiety and a persistent inability to recognise one’s own success. The Rose Review of Female Entrepreneurship ’s research shows 28% of working women feel that the imposter syndrome stopped them from speaking up in a meeting or prevents them from suggesting a new alternate idea at work.

Women leaders during coaching have sometimes confessed to the inverted consciousness syndrome or the patriarchy in action, submitting to male superiority, where they often believe their male colleagues to be smarter, more leader-like and superior to themselves.

While women need to work harder at overcoming their own self-imposed barriers to success, organisations need to shift the needle on inclusion by:

* Enhancing a sense of belonging for everyone, and focusing on inclusion to leverage the true benefits of diversity

* Providing empathetic leadership, which is key. Many organisations have men as diversity partners or ‘allies for women’ initiatives to enable men to create inclusion moments for women and mentor them to success

* Taking a bottoms-up approach to culture as this is vital, so culture-building is seen as everyone’s responsibility

* Not having inclusion as just a training programme, since it’s in everyday moments, actions and behaviour

* Not emphasising only on numbers and quotas, as these alone don’t enable inclusion. Like one leader said, the numbers obsession leads to lowering the bar on quality of talent. Diversity & inclusion is about opportunities, not numbers, reservations and entitlements

* Providing psychological safety to speak freely and making engaging connections, as this is key to becoming inclusive

* Knowing how important sisterhood is, as women include other women. One leading company that has progressively employed 40% women was alarmed at how women did not apply through IJP for jobs that reported to women bosses. Encouraging women leadership to succeed, while women leaders offer key roles to other competent women, is ever so important to set off a virtuous cycle of inclusion and success

* Revisiting the idea of ‘culture fit’ to not perpetuate biases, affinities and inner-circle hiring. ‘Fit’ can exclude, whereas real inclusion is a philosophy that everyone has something of value to contribute and that everyone has a right to belong

PATNA: One male and two female Aldabra tortoises will soon be brought from Seychelles to the Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park , commonly known as the Patna zoo. The state government had sent a letter to the Seychelles embassy in this regard last week.

Environment, forest and climate change department principal secretary Dipak Kumar Singh told this newspaper on Tuesday, “I discussed the matter with the embassy over phone and got an informal confirmation. Now, we have to send a proposal to the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) for bringing the world’s largest free-roaming tortoises to the Patna zoo.”

Singh added, “It will take almost eight months to complete the whole procedure and get the nod of the CZA and the Directorate General of Foreign Trade. Hence, the Patna zoo is likely to get the tortoises by next year.”

At present, the Aldabra tortoise can only be found at the Nehru Zoological Park in Hyderabad and the Alipore Zoological Garden in Kolkata.

Patna zoo director Amit Kumar said, “The authorities will create an enclosure, comprising a shelter, a swampy area and a small pond, for the Aldabra tortoises. They will be served apples, pears, bananas, tomatoes, peas, carrots, almonds and beans.”

The Aldabra giant tortoise from Aldabra Atoll in Seychelles is said to be one of the largest species of tortoises on the planet. It is also one of the world’s longest living animals. “Few years ago, an Aldabra tortoise, which was brought from the Barrackpore zoo in Latbagan by Lord Clive in 1875, had died in Kolkata,” Kumar said, adding males were considerably larger than females and had longer and thicker tails.

PATNA: A 25-year-old woman received gunshot injuries when an unidentified person fired at the owner of a general store where she had gone to purchase stationery items on Tuesday.

The incident took place at Naya Tola under Kadamkaun police station area in city. The woman, identified as Tarana Khatoon, was rushed to Patna Medical College and Hospital where she underwent surgery. Police said the victim is a native of Godda district in Jharkhand and was living in Patna to prepare for competitive examinations. People in the neighbourhood said general store owner Rajesh Kumar had heated arguments with a roadside vendor almost an hour before the incident.

Kadamkuan police station SHO (incharge) Rakesh Kumar said Tarana suddenly felt like an electric shock in her left leg soon after she reached the shop. “The very next moment she saw heavy bleeding from left thigh. Locals bandaged the wound with cloths and rushed her to hospital,” the SHO said and added that the woman was living in a hostel in the same locality. Kumar said no empty cartridge was recovered from the spot.

Town DSP Suresh Prasad, who rushed to PMCH, said actually the general store owner was the target. “The store owner had heated arguments with a person who used to sell fast food on a roadside cart nearby. Minutes before the firing took place, both shopowners had badly abused each other,” the DSP said.

He said the fast food shopowner’s associate had reached the spot and opened fire resulting in injury to the student. No one was arrested in this connection, he added.

PATNA: Former JD(U) vice-president Prashant Kishor on Tuesday failed to get an immediate relief from the sessions court in Patna during the hearing of his anticipatory bail in a cheating and forgery case lodged by a Congress worker on February 25.

After hearing the arguments, the district & sessions court called for the case dairy from the police station and set March 7 as the next date of hearing while simultaneously transferring the case to an additional district judge’s court.

According to the FIR lodged at the Pataliputra police station, the complainant, Shashwat Gautam, has alleged that Kishore had illegally used content and data from the latter’s stolen laptop to launch his political programme ‘Baat Bihar Ki’ on February 18.

Gautam, who is associated with the Congress IT cell in the state, claimed in the FIR that he had prepared his party’s poll campaign related advertisement after gathering data and had named it ‘Bihar Ki Baat’.

Gautam also filed a case against Kishore before the Patna chief judicial magistrate’s court on February 27 for stealing his slogan logo and data resulting in a loss of around Rs 10 crore.

The Congress worker alleged that the content and data found its way to Kishor after one of the latter’s associates Osama Khurshid, who is also named as an accused in the FIR along with Kishor, disappeared with a laptop that had the data prepared for the Congress poll campaign. He also alleged that Khurshid shared the data with Kishor and some of his other associates.

Gautam has claimed that he had registered a domain name ‘Bihar Ki Baat’ on January 7 this year, while Kishore’s domain ‘Baat Bihar Ki’ was registered on February 16.

The FIR against the duo is registered under Sections 467 (forgery of valuable security, bill), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 406 (punishment for criminal conspiracy) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of Indian Penal Code.

PATNA: CM Nitish Kumar on Tuesday asked officials of five departments to sit together and prepare a comprehensive policy to promote manufacturing and use of electric vehicles in the state.

“Senior officials of industries, energy, urban development and housing, transport and finance departments should hold a joint meeting in near future and discuss all practical aspects before finalizing a policy for promoting such vehicles,” Nitish said while reviewing an industries department’s presentation on the state government’s draft policy on ‘Electric Vehicle Manufacturing.’

At the directive of NITI Aayog, the Centre has asked all states to make its own policy for promotion of electric vehicle manufacturing. State’s investment commissioner R S Shrivastava said there was need of making certain amendments to the Bihar Industrial Investment Promotion Policy- 2016 to promote electric vehicle manufacturing in the state.

“Bring such a policy that generate employment, benefits maximum people and protect environment of urban areas. If a company wants to manufacture e-rickshaws in Bihar, you must give them certain benefits. Electric vehicle buyers too should be given certain incentives,” Nitish told the officials.

He also asked them to include electric vehicles under the Mukhya Mantri Gram Parivahan Yojna. “Take necessary steps to promote electric vehicles in small towns having civic bodies like nagar parishad and nagar panchayat,” the CM said.

He also asked the officials to make necessary plans to set up adequate number of charging stations for electric vehicles in different towns.

69,['4/03/2020'],300 kids trafficked from Bihar rescued last year: DSW,"Representative image

PATNA: The task force of Directorate of Social Welfare (DSW) has rescued 300 trafficked children below 18 years from other states in 2019. It had rescued 317 children in 2018.

Altogether 7,367 children in 2018 and 5,757 in 2019 were restored to their families across the state, according to sources at DSW.

In the latest report of National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Bihar ranked third in child trafficking cases in the country after Rajasthan and West Bengal in 2017 when 362 boys and 33 girls below 18 years of age were rescued. The report also mentioned one child trafficking case per day in Bihar.

Social Welfare Department director Raj Kumar told this newspaper that Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Telangana were the main states for child trafficking from Bihar and the main source districts included Gaya, Samastipur, East Champaran, West Champaran, Purnea, Sitamarhi and Muzaffarpur.

Kumar said no specific people acted as perpetrators as family, spouse, friends and neighbours could be a trafficker. “They may pose as job recruiters, matchmakers or others who promise employment or marriage. Poverty, often cited as a major reason, is not the only cause for child trafficking,” he said.

“In 2019, around 300 child labourers were rescued — 129 from Rajasthan, 99 from Maharashtra, 72 from Telangana and 52 from Chennai. About 125 trafficked children were rescued from Rajasthan in January and February. Engaged in different sectors, especially bangle making, they belonged to Gaya, Samastipur, Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga,” Kumar said.

He added: “For speedy transfer and restoration of the children from destination states, a state-level special task force comprising representatives of DSW, labour resources department and home department is working in Bihar.”

Following the principal of de-institutionalization of children and for the speedy reunification of the children residing in child care institutions (CCIs), a special drive was initiated by the DSW in 2018. Under the close monitoring of the directorate, all the CCIs started verification of addresses of the residing children using different methods.

The director said Aadhaar card was used as one of the important tools through which addresses of the children were located by using biometrics details. “The process helped and those children were restored to their families very easily. In about 0.1% cases, parents were not ready to accept their kids,” Kumar said.

He said the task force also ensures that the kids are comfortable at their restored home. “We have the database of all the children rescued and restored to their families. We monitor their progress on monthly basis. The rescue, restoration and rehabilitation would not be possible without the cooperation of all the stakeholders,” he said.

Presently, there are 33 CCIs across the state and 1,300 children, including girls, are living at these institutions.

PATNA: Hundreds of contractual schoolteachers under TET Teacher’s Sangharsh Samanvay Samiti staged protest with symbolic begging bowls from Patna Junction to Secretariat on Tuesday. They were protesting against the state government policy towards the contractual teachers of government schools.

The protesting teachers have been boycotting classes across the state since February 17. They raised slogans like ‘Supreme Court ka samman karo… Para 78 lagu karo’ and ‘Yogyata ka samman karo, TET shikshako ko sahayak shikshak ka darja do’ among others.

The protesting teachers approached passersby and collected money by begging on the road. They collected over Rs5,000 and have got a cheque ready to give it to the CM’s Secretariat.

State convener of the committee, Amit Vikram, said the state government should implement the Supreme Court (SC) judgment, in which Para 78 said about giving better payscale to the expert teachers. “TET teachers have been demanding the status of assistant teacher and state worker for the last 10 months,” he said.

Vikram said, “CM Nitish Kumar says the state government did not have enough funds to raise the salary of teachers. So, we have collected funds by begging on the road.”

Rajneesh Ranjan, chairman of the committee, said honouring the SC order, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand governments have given TET teachers the status of assistant teachers. “Bihar government should also do it,” he said.

Amardeep D’Souza, a member of the committee, said thousands of teachers across the state would stage protest at Gardanibagh on March 13 against the state government’s policy.

HYDERABAD: Karvy Stock Broking Limited (KSBL) suffered a blow on Tuesday when the Telangana high court refused to stall a probe ordered by the Union ministry of corporate affairs into the alleged irregularities in Karvy and its group of companies, along with nine other firms connected to it.

Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili dismissed a plea filed by KSBL against a probe by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO), which works under the corporate affairs ministry.

While Karvy counsel argued that it was unlawful to order an SFIO probe under section 212 without following sections 206 and 208, the judge did not agree with him after the Centre’s counsel brought to the notice of the court the probe done by Registrar of Companies (ROC), Hyderabad, under section 208 of the Companies Act. “In fact, it was the ROC which had recommended a thorough probe into the affairs of Karvy,” he contended.

The judge brushed aside the contention that the officials did not follow an earlier directive from the high court that ordered them to give Karvy a personal hearing before resorting to any final decision.

In fact, the probe was already ordered and the same was informed to the high court by assistant solicitor general (ASG) Namavarapu Rajeswara Rao. “We have power to do so under section 212 of the Companies Act,” he said.

ROC conducted a probe and submitted an inquiry report on February 24 under section 208, he said. Along with Karvy and its group companies, Karvy Consultants, Wizard Insurance Services, Zenith Insurance Services, Buoyant Insurance Services, Nova Wealth Management Services, Classic Wealth Management Services, Champion Insurance Services and Pelican Wealth Services will have to face the SFIO probe, he argued.

The ASG further said the Centre has got powers to order a probe into such matters. After hearing this, the judge dismissed Karvy’s plea, thereby paving the way for an SFIO probe into the affairs of Karvy and its group of firms.

73,['4/03/2020'],Govt plans incentives for bulk drug makers,"Rupali Mukherjee | TNNMumbai: The government is planning an incentive package to revive domestic manufacturing of bulk drugs (active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs), which may include fiscal or infrastructure-related benefits, or allocating a corpus for the sector.Speculation on the proposed measures to incentivise API production intensified among industry circles on Tuesday, after reports about government’s plans to work out a massive incentive scheme to boost local mobile manufacturing. In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, there has been disruption in supply chain of imported APIs and key starting materials from China, which could soon impact production of commonly-used drugs like antibiotics, vitamins and paracetamol.Of the total imports of APIs, China accounts for around 70%, while in specific ingredients like cephalosporins, azithromycin and penicillin, the dependence is as high as 80-90%. Over 8-10 years ago, India was self-reliant on key intermediates and ingredients used in antibiotics and fermentation products.There have been multiple rounds of inter-ministerial discussions, along with NITI Aayog also involved since January, with several proposals like a moratorium on loans, fiscal and procedural support, infrastructure benefits like cheap land, and faster clearances discussed, sources told TOI.“Covid-19 is a wake-up call for India, and we need to adopt short-, medium- and long-term strategies to make the country self-sufficient in key starting materials (KSMs), intermediates and APIs. As short-term measures, the government may incentivise the medium and small scale sector, and certain large companies which were earlier API producers, but shut shop on account of dumping by Chinese companies. As mid-term measures, existing clusters in states like Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat should be fast-tracked for manufacturing of APIs and KSMs on parity with incentives provided to industry in China (both in terms of financing and other incentives),” Dinesh Dua , chairman, Pharmexcil, said.The pharmaceuticals department is also formulating a strategy to revive domestic manufacturing of APIs. An earlier official communication in February said the government is looking at challenges faced (by industry) and various options available to make India a powerhouse in KSMs and APIs. A couple of years earlier, government had made an allocation of around Rs 200 crore inviting companies for five API clusters, which was met with tepid interest, sources said, adding, to start with, a minimum investment of Rs 1,000 crore should be made.A majority of intermediates and APIs are manufactured by MSMEs, and government benefits should reach them, an industry official said. “We have been involved in discussions on how to build long-term health security, and for APIs, greenfield units are being considered,” said Sudarshan Jain of Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance . An earlier meeting in February was held between NITI Aayog and industry including Cipla, Dr Reddy’s, Sun Pharma and Zydus to “turbo-charge the API industry”.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-plans-incentives-for-bulk-drug-makers/articleshow/74466401.cms
74,['4/03/2020'],Delhi violence delays framing of CAA rules,"Kolkata: The Delhi violence has come in the way of the Narendra Modi government framing rules under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ), sources in the Bengal BJP have said.

Union home minister Amit Shah has the draft rules ready but would prefer to wait for about a month for the BJP-RSS to complete its public outreach programme, particularly in Bengal, and send feedbacks to the Centre, said some of those Bengal BJP functionaries who attended a meeting with Shah in Kolkata on Sunday. The Bengal unit of the party expects the rules to be in place by April.

The CAA seeks to give citizenship to Hindu, Sikh, Parsi, Buddhist and Christian refugees from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who entered India on or before January 31, 2014. But the new law has left many early refugees in Bengal, who came from East Pakistan during the early years of Partition and have now got integrated with the mainstream, wondering whether they need to apply for citizenship under the CAA.

“My father came from East Pakistan in 1952. He died in 2005. I was born in Kolkata in 1960. Should I apply for citizenship under the CAA?” wondered Beliaghata resident and central government employee Aparup Mukherjee.

According to Calcutta High Court lawyer Moloy Das, the CAA is unclear about the early cut-off date and herein lies the confusion. “Going by the CAA, all refugees need to apply for citizenship. But the government of India had announced that those who came to India before 25 March, 1971 are citizens,” he said.

“Those born in India between 1950 and before July 1, 1987 are citizens by birth no matter if their parents came from East Pakistan. People born after July 1, 1987 have to prove that one of their parents is an Indian citizen,” Das said. The existing rules are, however, tough for those born after December 30, 2004. These teens have to substantiate that they were born to parents who are both Indian citizens. The Vajpayee government brought this change during the NDA regime in 2003-04.

State BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu admitted there was some confusion over the new law. “People are asking us what they should do to apply for citizenship. They want to know if they have to wait in queues. We are telling them that a self-declaration mentioning the entry date to India and the place from where they came will suffice. They can make online application too. The other questions will be clear once the CAA rules are published,” he said.

The BJP functionary claimed there is a strong undercurrent of support for CAA in Bengal. “A refugee migrating to India from Bangladesh after doing his graduation in Rajshahi University of Bangladesh can’t apply for a government job in India. He can apply for the job once he gets citizenship under CAA,” he said.

75,['4/03/2020'],2 leopard cubs spotted at Sangavade in Maval,"The three-week-old cubs were spotted around 9am on Tuesday.

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Two leopard cubs were spotted on a field at Sangavade village in Maval taluka while harvesting sugar cane, around 5km from the twin cities on Tuesday.

Assistant conservator of forests in Pune, Sanjay Marne, said, “The three-week-old leopard cubs were spotted on farmer Jalinder Liman ’s field around 9am. Two rescue teams - one from the forest department and another from the animal orphanage at Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park — reached the spot. Villagers were not allowed to approach the cubs. We restricted the cubs to the spot where they were found in an attempt to reunite them with their mother.”

Deputy sarpanch Nitin Rakshe said, “Cages were installed in Kalevasti and another spot in the village four months ago after a leopard was sighted but no animal was caught. Then the cages were removed after a week. Meanwhile, we have stopped sugar cane harvesting in the area where the cubs were found today. We have again demanded the installation of the cage.”

Rakshe said around 70% sugar cane has been harvested till date and the process should be completed in a month. “Leopards will not be able to hide in the thicket after harvesting season ends and their sightings will become more frequent,” he added.

Villager Vikas Liman, said, “Residents are scared as the mother leopard might be roaming around. The forest department must catch it.”

The four leopard cubs found in Rajuri and Gunjalwadi villages during sugar cane harvesting on Saturday were reunited with their mothers on Sunday.

KOZHIKODE: A man who had lost his house in the devastating 2019 floods in Wayanad has committed suicide . M Sanal , 46, hailing from Nathamkuni near Meppadi was found hanging in a temporary shed on Monday night.

Sanal and his family were living in a small plot of land for which he didn’t have any possession records. The house which was partially damaged in the 2018 floods was completely destroyed in last year’s floods.

Sanal is survived by wife Sajini, daughter Navya and son Navneeth.

Relatives of Sanal said that he has very upset over not receiving any compensation or help from the government to rebuild his house.

“He has not even received the emergency relief of Rs 10,000 announced by the government to all flood victims. He had been going to the panchayat and village office to get help to rebuild his house and was very frustrated that it was not happening,” brother-in-law of Sanal said.

Angry local residents prevented the shifting of the body for postmortem and insisted that the tahsildar should visit the spot.

Kalpetta MLA C K Saseendran said that Sanal faced delays in getting included in the LIFE housing scheme due to difficulties in producing land records.

Vythiri tahsildar Abdul Harris who submitted a report to the revenue department on the incident said that Rs 4 lakh was sanctioned for Sanal as compensation. But the first instalment of Rs 1 lakh could not be deposited as the account number he had provided was a Jan Dhan account which had a yearly transaction limit of Rs 1 lakh.

He said that the village officer has been directed to issue possession certificate for the land to Sanal’s family who have been residing in the land, belonging to a Kuruma ancestral family.

Meppadi panchayat president K K Sahad said the the panchayat will bear the educational expenses of Sanal’s two children.

PUNE: A sessions court on Tuesday convicted and sentenced a 41-year-old man from Maval taluka to 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment for sexually assaulting a girl (5) residing in his neighbourhood in October 2016.

The girl was playing in front of her house on October 30, 2016, when the accused (name withheld to protect the victim’s identity) visited her house and asked her mother for some food. After eating, he took the girl with him to a nearby farm field and sexually assaulted her before dropping her back home.

The incident came to light the same evening when the girl complained of pain in her private parts and narrated the incident to her mother. The lodged an FIR with the Talagaon Dabhade police the following day, after which the accused was arrested.

Additional sessions judge R V Adone found the accused guilty of an offence under Section 5(m) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act for aggravated sexual assault and sentenced him to 10 years in jail, besides imposing Rs 10,000 fine on him.

The court further directed that Rs 7,000 of the fine amount be given to the survivor as a compensation.

78,['4/03/2020'],Satej to discuss shifting of sub-jail from Bindu chowk,"CLEARED SKHER

Kolhapur: District guardian minister Satej Patil is going to discuss with state jail authorities whether Bindu Chowk sub jail can be shifted or the development restrictions relaxed. Patil is also the minister of state for home.

Locals from Bindu chowk area and the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) have repeatedly sought shifting of the jail facility. The presence of the jail has put restrictions on the construction activity in the area.

The sub-jail facility at Bindu Chowk currently houses under-trails. According to the jail manual, no construction is allowed within the periphery of 50 metres of the sub-jail or district jail. For the central jails, the restrictions are for 150-m surroundings. The KMC has proposed a toilet facility and a multi-level car parking at an open space adjoining the sub-jail.

The existing parking space is used by thousands of visitors coming to the Mahalaxmi temple located nearby. Officials claim that around 70% of the visitors of the temple park their vehicles in this open space. The parking is currently managed by the staff of Kolhapur Municipal Transport (KMT).

“I have learnt about the development restrictions near sub-jail. I have asked the KMC officials to write a letter to the jail authorities to shift the jail or relax the development restrictions. The KMC has to provide alternate site for the sub-jail facility, which will be convenient for the jail authorities as well. I am going to hold a meeting with state jail officials to work a way out,” Patil told TOI.

Civic officials claimed that three-storey parking facility can be developed at the site. The KMC had in 2015 passed a resolution in the general body demanding shifting of the sub-jail facility. In 2017, the KMC had proposed a toilet facility at the site for visitors. However, the work was stalled after the jail authorities objected to it.

The locals are also facing restrictions for re-developing the existing dilapidated buildings. A couple of years ago, the KMC removed the dangerously dilapidated buildings in the vicinity. Many owners are waiting for building permission.

A senior town planning official of KMC said, “The prison manual has restricted the development activities for the security of the jail inmates. The locals are ready to build their house up to limited height, however we cannot process their application because of the total restrictions over construction activities.”

The jail was constructed in 1860s to house the criminals from Kolhapur princely state. The total area of the jail is around 1.5 acre and it has six barracks. There is a separate barrack for women inmates.

80,['4/03/2020'],No salary if KMC staff fails to pay their own water &amp; property tax dues,"Picture for representational purpose only.

KOLHAPUR: The salaries of Kolhapur Municipal Corporation ( KMC ) employees will be withheld this month if they have water and property tax dues.

Nitin Desai, the additional commissioner of KMC, has issued a circular addressing the heads of all the departments asking them to order the staff to clear water tax and property tax dues. As per an internal inquiry, it was found that most of the KMC’s 3,500 employees had evaded the taxes.

“We have asked the departmental heads to ensure that the employees have paid the taxes. Only after ensuring that the tax has been paid, will the salary of the employee be released. If needed, the tax dues will be recovered from the salary. The tax dues ideally should have been paid before February 28 to get the salaries released,” Desai said.

The water and property tax department has initiated the recovery process. Water supply connections are being snapped and the properties are being sealed for recover dues. The defaulters are instructed to pay the dues as soon as possible.

The KMC is facing an unprecedented deficit in the revenue, which is most likely to affect the development works in the coming financial year. The current financial year is going to end on March 31 and with just four weeks left, the KMC is yet to recover tax dues amounting to over Rs 150 crore from citizens.

Last month, the salaries of the water supply department employees were withheld for over a week mainly because of slow tax recovery — which led to there being not adequate money to pay the salaries. A similar situation is likely this month too in other departments.

Prashant Pandat, the chief water tax superintendent of KMC, said, “I have asked my staff to submit the bills of the water and property tax bills to get their salaries deposited in their account. Those who do not have their property will have to submit the bills paid for the water and property taxes of the properties they are living in.”

The matter of these unused bus shelters came up for discussion at the recent gram sabha held at the Candolim panchayat.

Candolim sarpanch Blaise Fernandes assured the villagers that he would look into the matter. When contacted, Calangute panchayat members said the new bus shelter has already been notified. But the matter has not been pursued because bus drivers still halt at the old spot nearby and commuters, too, stand there so they do not miss the bus.

And with no buses stopping there, the new facilities are being used by vehicle owners to park there, further blocking access.

AHMEDABAD: An industrialist from Vastrapur on Tuesday filed a complaint of cheating and forgery with cyber crime police station alleging that he had lost Rs 1.37 crore to online cheats when his sim card went inoperative for four days.

Dwarkaprasad Bajaj runs a chemical dyes unit in Naroda GIDC and lives in Sunrise Park on Drive-In Road. He stated that he lost the money in 21 different transactions, which was siphoned into accounts in Delhi and Kolkata, between February 28 and March 2.

Bajaj stated that he has been using internet banking to use his current accounts through his mobile phone for a long time. “On February 28 at around 4pm, I was to take a flight to Jaipur from Ahmedabad. When I was boarding, I found no network on my phone and thought it was due to network issues at the airport,” he stated in the FIR.

Bajaj said his phone did not work after that and when he returned home on Monday morning, his phone was still dead. “My son on Monday called my driver’s mobile number and informed me that some fraudsters had withdrawn Rs 1.37 crore two bank accounts of my company,” Bajaj stated in the FIR.

Bajaj got his accounts locked and went to the customer care centre of his telecom service provider. He was informed that someone had got his sim card re-issued by providing his documents on February 28. He said he had not got it re-issued but some cheats had forged his documents and to get the sim card re-issued.

As the sim card in Bajaj’s phone got inoperative, he did not receive any OTPs (one-time passwords), rather the cheats who had the new sim card issued received the OTPs and carried out the fraud.

A police official said the sim card was re-issued from a customer care centre in the Paldi area of the city.

Cyber crime police registered a case of cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy along with charges under the Information Technology Act.

Taking a cue from European countries, south Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) is planning to allow open-air restaurants along with light music.A draft policy has already been prepared, a senior official said. “The new policy will allow the existing health trade-licence holders to use their open space for such restaurants. Besides offering a new dining experience, the move will also help the civic body in generating more revenues,” he added.SDMC has around 2,000 restaurants and eateries under its jurisdiction and several hundreds of these establishments will be able to utilise their open space on the ground floor to expand their operations. The draft proposal will now be sent to the deliberative wing of the corporation for the final approval.The draft makes it clear that “neither live band performances nor loud music will be allowed. Only light music like mellow jazz or ghazal can be played in the background,” another official said. Regulations prohibit noise levels to be higher than 45-55 decibels in the residential areas.However, unlike some west European countries, establishments will not be allowed to use the pavement space for seating arrangements. “Open areas should be privately owned by a licensee and no public area can be encroached upon,” the official added.To prevent fire accidents, the draft prohibits any open-area kitchen. “Food will have to be prepared in enclosed kitchens, which will have to follow all safety standards in terms of hygiene and fire safety,” he said.To regulate these open-air restaurants, SDMC has decided that only people with a licence for running an indoor restaurant will be allowed to run these new facilities.While the draft proposes a licensing fee of around Rs 100 per square foot, the final rates will be decided by the standing committee and the SDMC House. “This policy will now be sent to the standing committee and minor tweaks are expected,” the official said. Under the current plan, an open-air restaurant with a sitting capacity of 50 people may have to shell out Rs 45-50,000 annually.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74467327,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-309939,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/you-can-soon-dine-in-the-open-in-s-delhi-eateries/articleshow/74466513.cms

AHMEDABAD: City police seem to have decided to pay tribute to the father of the Indian Constitution, Dr B R Ambedkar , 70 years after the Constitution came into force on January 26, 1950. A circular was recently issued directing that a portrait or statue of Dr Ambedkar be put up at all police stations, ACP (assistant commissioner of police) and DCP (deputy commissioner of police) offices across the city.

Circular number 423/2020 issued on February 28 with the subject “71st Republic Day” states, “It is being informed that you will have to put a portrait/statue of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar at the office or branches being headed by you. All have been directed to act accordingly because we are observing the 71st year of the introduction of the Indian Constitution.”

DCP, control, Vijay Patel, who issued the circular, said the decision was with an eye on teh birth anniversary of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar on April 14. “Besides, we have been celebrating 70 years of the Indian Constitution, due to which the decision was taken,” said Patel.

He further said that they received an order from the home department to put up portraits of Dr Ambedkar. Patel said every police station must have a portrait of Dr Ambedkar now.

Police officials said police stations or other offices at present only have portraits of Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.

“We began putting up portraits of Mahatma Gandhi after they were presented by a trust three years ago. In October 2019, it was directed to put up portraits of Sardar Patel during the ‘Run for Unity’ event. We do not have portraits of Dr Babasaheb in our police stations,” said a police official.

The official added that this should have done earlier, because the police administration and implementation of law are governed by the Constitution.

City police commissioner Ashish Bhatia also said that the circular to put up portraits of Dr Ambedkar was issued recently.

Neighbours said Rajamma, 87, of Pilappuzha, was attacked by stray dogs, but hospital sources said the wounds might not have caused her death.

The incident came to light around 7pm, when a woman from the neighbourhood reached Rajamma’s house, where she used to sleep since the elderly woman had been living alone.

The woman searched for Rajamma on not finding her in the house. She and a few others soon found Rajamma lying unconscious. Neighbours expressed suspicion that the dogs might have attacked her when she went to burn accumulated dry leaves.

“There were bite injuries on the back of her head and hands. There are no houses close by, and others did not hear anything. Though neighbours took her to Haripad Government Hospital , her life could not be saved,” police said, adding that the body has been kept in the morgue.

Haripad sub-inspector M Hussain said the exact cause of death could be ascertained only after post-mortem at Alappuzha Medical College Hospital on Wednesday.

“We also suspect that she might have fallen unconscious due to age-related ailments and after that dogs might have attacked her. However, we are awaiting an autopsy report,” the officer said.

Rajamma was the headmistress of Aroor Lower Primary School. She leaves behind son Sreekumar , and daughters Sandhya and Mini.

Nagpur: Intellect, clarity of thought and witty answers the city software engineer Sarita Samatkar gave earned her the first runner-up prize at the national beauty pageant ‘Miss Skindrella 2020’.

The only Maharashtrian to participate in the contest held at Delhi to celebrate natural beauty and inner confidence, Sarita was at her best and was a picture perfect.

Sarita said, “I came to know about the beauty contest on Facebook. I was fascinated as the contest was more than just showcasing outer beauty. I had participated last year also and was selected in top fifty. This year, I was determined to make it to the finals.”

She said it was tough as there were over 20,000 participants from 33 cities, and the girls participating in the pageant had to solicit votes to make it to the list of the participants. Sarita mustered enough votes and finally landed in Delhi to participate.

“I uploaded my pictures and got enough votes to enter straight away into the top 100. I then made it to the top 10. After this, I sent a video to the organizers where I explained why I want to participate in the competition,” Sarita said.

The contest was different in the sense there were no evening gown or swimwear rounds and ramp walk. She said, “There were no parameters of having a specific body type. I had a question and answer round in which I gave honest opinion. My witty answers too weighed in my favour.”

Sarita won Rs1 lakh cash prize, a silver jewellery hamper and an opportunity to become ambassador for a brand that makes skincare products.

The jury members were journalist Ambika Singh, cinematographer-director Sandeep Salariya and actress Saheba Bali, besides others.

“It is an overwhelming feeling to be the only Maharashtrian in the contest and bring laurels to the city,” an elated Sarita said.

AHMEDABAD: A 19-year-old woman from the Krishnanagar area of city on Monday filed a complaint with city police alleging that a 22-year-old man, her superior at work, threatened to disfigure her with acid because she refused to enter a relationship with him.

The woman also alleged that the accused, Pravin Rathod, published morphed pictures of her, but Krishnanagar police did not invoke charges under the Information Technology (IT) Act against him.

In her FIR, Sakshi Shah, who a second year BA student at BD Arts College in Kadi, works at a multiplex in Krishnanagar as her father is dead.

She had met the accused, her supervisor at work, when she took up the job in November last year.

“As I was working with him, I started talking to him in a platonic manner but he began sending me messages frequently and would also call me every now and then,” Shah stated in the FIR.

“Recently, he stopped me outside our workplace and told me that he wants a relationship with me and pressured me to accept his proposal. When I refused, he threatened to throw acid on my face,” she adds.

Even after this, Rathod tried contacting her several times. As she blocked his number, he kept calling from 10 different numbers. “He had also morphed pictures of me with him and published them online,” she said.

She finally approached police and filed a complaint against Rathod.

Inspector V R Chaudhari of Krishnanagar police station said that they have booked the accused under IPC sections 507 (criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication) and 506(2) (criminal intimidation).

On why charges under the IT Act were not invoked, Chaudhari said police were yet to verify whether he had morphed and published the pictures.

HYDERABAD: A farmer in a remote village of Jagtial district in Telangana landed in a soup for making an innocuous online payment to a person in Jammu and Kashmir . Reason: he sent Rs 9,000 to an accused in an espionage case. Ironically, the transactions were carried out a month after the accused was arrested.

A Jammu & Kashmir police team are questioning Linganna, 36, a farmer from Kusthapur village, for his role in the espionage case registered in January.

A three-member team of Arnia police in Jammu district, led by sub-inspector (SI) Hussain, arrived in Mallapur town in Jagtial district on Monday night. With the help of local police, the team picked up Linganna from Kusthapur village on Tuesday in relation to the espionage case.

According to police sources, J&K police had arrested Rakesh Kumar, a resident of Arnia on January 5, 2020, for sharing information about military establishments with a woman through Facebook. “Police believe the woman was a spy working for Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and they arrested Rakesh Kumar for sharing details of security installations in and around Arnia, a town close to the Line of Control (LoC),” a source said.

Over a month after Rakesh Kumar was arrested, Linganna had transferred Rs 5,000 into the bank account of Rakesh Kumar through Google Pay on February 13, 2020 and Rs 4,000 on February 25. “Arnia police, who had analysed the bank account transactions of Rakesh Kumar, noticed the funds transfer from Linganna. After obtaining details from the bank, they reached Jagtial on Monday night to question him,” Telangana police said.

On interrogation, Linganna told police that he transferred the money on the instructions of his brother-in-law, Srinivas. Police said Srinivas, a native of Mogilpet village in Mallapur mandal, has been working in Dubai for the past 10 years.

“The Jammu & Kashmir police are questioning Linganna. They are now trying to get a warrant from a Jammu court,” Jagtial superintendent of police (SP) Ch Sindhu Sharma said.

99,['4/03/2020'],Kolhapur: Watch out for snakes in your premises with rising temperature,"Picture for representational purpose only.

The surge in the mercury levels has also led to a rise in the number of snake bites in the district ahead of summer. The Chhatrapati Pramila Raje (CPR) hospital has had 13 snake bite cases on single day on Monday. Though snakes belong to the category of coldblooded animals, too much hot or too much cold can lead to their death. Hence, snakes in search of shade and wet places come out of their holes, increasing their chances of them coming in contact with humans.

Snake researcher Umakant Chavan said, “Though snakes are coldblooded animals, they don’t like it too cold or too hot. They are forced to leave their holes as the surge in the mercury levels also increases the ground level temperature. Snakes migrate to take shelter at shady areas which are cool like backyards, below wooden logs and wetlands. Nullahs and drainage, which are home to mounds of garbage, are found to attact rats. Hence, such places attract snakes as they are cool places to relax in hot summers and they also get their source of prey.”

Dhananjay Namjoshi , a citizen who takes immense interest in the study of snakes, said, “Earlier during winter, I used to get a call for rescuing snakes from the city limits once in three to four days. Now, I am getting a call everyday. The only precaution people can take to keep snakes away is to keep their surroundings clean. One must stay alert while going in wet areas or near garbage zones. Farmers should use gumboots to avoid snake bites.

“The ratio of snake bites in rural areas is far more compared to the that in the city. Many a times, snake bites go unreported in the rural areas as people there opt for traditional methods to treat bites,” said Namjoshi.

Assistant professor at CPR Hospital Vijaykumar Barage said, “Snake bite cases increase during the sugarcane cutting season. People in rural areas still go for traditional medication which can sometimes lead to death of a person. Anti-venom syringes should be taken as early as possible. These syringes are available aplenty at the CPR hospital and also at the primary health centres across the district. The anti-venom dosage is decided by the species of the snake and also the intensity the snake bite. For primary first-aid, a cloth can be tied above the area which has been bitten till the time the patient is taken to the nearby health centre for proper treatment”.

“It has come to the notice of the Board that some of the non-affiliated schools whose applications are either under process or rejected by the Board, or they have not applied for affiliation at all, are misleading parents by displaying various display boards at schools, prominent locations and on website showing messages such as ‘to be affiliated to CBSE’, ‘CBSE Pattern’, ‘likely to be affiliated to CBSE’, ‘running under the aegis of CBSE’ etc. It may be noted that as per clause 14.2.2 of its affiliation Bye-Laws, 2018, the board does not allow non-affiliated school to present the candidates to the Board’s examination,” said the statement.

The board also asked parents to check the affiliation status (including up to what class the affiliation is given by the board) of schools before enrolling their kids. “The parents may go through CBSE affiliation website www.cbseaff.nic.in where link for region wise/state wise list of schools has been given and the same also contains list of disaffiliated schools,” the statement said.

Meanwhile, the Class X students of ALSS and their parents said that the high court’s interim order directing CBSE to allow them to write the remaining board exam this year has given relief to them. “Our kids are happy and they are busy preparing for the remaining exams. We hope there will be a way to write the missed exams too so that they will not lose one year,” said Francis Xavier, a parent.

104,['4/03/2020'],Need alternative plans to WTE plant: Councillors,"Kochi: Councillors who attended corporation council meeting on Tuesday to discuss waste management stressed the need to consider alternative proposals with the National Green Tribunal (NGT) team questioning the viability of the waste-to-energy (WTE) plant at Brahmapuram. Reduction of waste at source, recycling and reuse, among other things, should be encouraged, they opined.

Councillors cutting across party lines raised objection against the state government’s decision to convert the concessionaire agreement, signed between the corporation and GJ Eco Power Private Limited allotting 23 acres of land for setting up the plant, into a lease agreement.

“We shouldn’t depend solely on the proposed WTE plant. Alternative projects must be considered, which can promote reduction, recycling and reuse of garbage,” said V P Chandran, secretary, LDF parliamentary party, Kochi Corporation.

A B Sabu, Congress councillor and former chairman of welfare standing committee, said the conversion of the concessionaire agreement into lease agreement would be detrimental for the local body. “The private firm would be mortgaging the property for raising funds to set up the plant. If the private firm fails to repay the loan, the responsibility of paying back the amount would fall on the local body. Then, the corporation will lose the land,” Sabu said. C K Peter, councillor from Konthuruthy, said the local body has been shelling out a huge sum for transportation and treatment of waste and improving infrastructure facilities at the waste treatment plant at Brahmapuram.

“The corporation has spent Rs 3.22 crore for hiring trucks in 2015-16 fiscal while it increased to Rs 3.68 crore in 2016-17 fiscal. In 2017-18, the amount stood at Rs 4.78 crore and increased to Rs 6.86 crore in 2018-19. The cost of treatment of waste has also been going up,” Peter said.

K J Antony, opposition leader, said leasing out the 23 acres to the private firm can’t be approved. It will lead to alienation of the land, he said. Gracy Babu Jacob, a ruling front councillor, said the local body authorities have miserably failed in ensuring effective waste management. “The corporation has been spending crores for hiring trucks for carrying garbage from the city to Brahmapuram. Still, many trucks, bought by the corporation have been lying idle at a yard,” she said.

JAIPUR: The officials at Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) have sent a proposed budget of Rs 2,046 crore to the Directorate of Local Bodies for approval.

Since the municipal board could not be constituted due to delay in municipal elections, the JMC commissioner formed a committee and the budget for 2020-21 was prepared.

A chief engineer, finance adviser, additional commissioner and other officers were part of the committee.

This year, the budget for both the municipal corporations has been bifurcated. For JMC Heritage, Rs 791cr and for JMC Greater, Rs 1,255cr have been allotted. Moreover, the JMC budget has been increased by Rs 171 crore since Rs 1,870 crore were allotted in the 2019-20 budget.

Financial adviser of JMC Mahendra Mohan said that they had sent the proposed budget before February 15. “We made our calculations and prepared the budget. As per the rules, the budget can be 20% higher than the income of the urban bodies in the preceding financial year. We have followed this for the first time at JMC,” said Mohan.

Another reason for increase in the cost is that Rs 50 crore has been allotted for Delawas sewage treatment plant. The capacity of the plant is being increased for which Rs 250 crore will be spent. The state government will provide Rs 200 crore and the remaining amount will be provided by JMC.

The budget has been divided in many parts as per the requirements of both the municipal corporations. Surprisingly, major share has been given to JMC Greater and Heritage has been left behind.

The Walled City has been facing sewage problem for a long time still JMC Greater has been allotted more budget.

Therefore, many former councillors from the Walled City have expressed opposition to the decision.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The opposition and the treasury benches in the assembly on Tuesday locked horns over the probe into the Periye twin murder case. Two Youth Congress workers, Kripesh, 20, and Sharath Lal, 24, were hacked to death, allegedly by CPM workers, at Periye in Kasaragod district last year.

Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the government does not agree with the high court single bench decision to hand over the case to CBI and that is why it has decided to file an appeal. He said the fees for such appeals have been paid from the government exchequer on earlier occasions too and the practice will continue. The CM’s usage of the word “loudmouth” and industries minister E P Jayarajan’s usage of unparliamentary wor-ds against the opposition triggered some tense moments in the assembly when the opposition rushed towards the speaker’s podium. The CM said things will progress as per law, and since the appeal is pending before a division bench, the government is awaiting its decision.

Seeking a leave for adjournment motion, Shafi Parambil MLA who piloted the demand, said that the government is deliberately causing hindrances in the probe by not handing over the case diary and related documents to the CBI, which the CBI officials have mentioned in their status report before the court.

He said that even though five months have passed since the high court single bench ordered the handing over of the case from the crime branch to the CBI, the crime branch is yet to hand over the documents to the CBI. Stating that the CPM had a clear role in the murders and which is why it is attempting to sabotage the CBI probe, he invited the attention of the chief minister to a recent speech by a CPM local leader in Kasaragod which justified the crime.

Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala asked if the party had no role in these murders, why was the government scared of a CBI inquiry and why it was trying to sabotage the investigation. Chennithala said that the government is trying to figure out ways to save the culprits, and the appeal before the division bench of the high court is a proof of the government’s mind-set. After speaker P Sreeramakrishnan refused to admit the adjournment motion on the basis of the explanation by the chief minister, the opposition members staged a walk-out.

Observing serious lapses in the police investigation, the high court had in September handed over the case to the CBI after dismissing the chargesheet filed by the crime branch.

The parents of the victims had moved the court seeking a CBI probe, saying police investigation was not on the right track. The state government had challenged the single-bench order for conducting a CBI probe, but a division bench declined to stay it.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: State government has issued a set of guidelines to be followed by all school authorities, including CBSE and ICSE institutions, while taking their students for study tours or industrial visits.

A government circular in this regard said the school authorities should choose only government-approved tour operators for the purpose.

“The list of approved tour operators is available on the Kerala tourism website. The indiscriminate selection of tour operators without government registration often creates problems for the tour parties. One such incident in which a group of students from the state got stranded in New Delhi in the middle of their tour is the immediate reason for such a circular,” said state general education secretary A Shajahan.

Government could seldom act against unregistered tour operators if they dump the tour party in the middle of a journey or cause any other sort of grave inconveniences to student groups, government sources said. The circular wanted the top authorities in schools to take up the total responsibility of all student tours and industrial visits from their institutions.

“The government direction is welcome. There is no second opinion on the fact that top authorities in the schools should be personally responsible for tour programmes. If the government says there is a list of approved and accredited tour operators whose service the schools can opt for smooth conduct of study tours and industrial visits, it is a good suggestion. I think the government intervention would help school authorities in a big way,” said Kerala CBSE school management association working president G Rajamohan.

According to highly-placed sources, the state would also demand payment of the pending SGST compensation of Rs 700 crore the Centre owes to it. As per GST Act, states are compensated if there is a dip in tax collection.

Telangana will also raise its concerns on its contribution to central schemes. The state government’s contribution for centrally-sponsored schemes is presenlty fixed at 40%, which is 10% more than what was set before. “We have been appealing to the Centre that money should be given to the state governments directly and how to spend and contribute for the schemes should be left to the states’ discretion,” a senior official said. Not only Telangana, several other states have been demanding this, he said.

Though the state’s revenue receipts saw a dip, the fiscal deficit has been within limits prescribed by the FRBM Act. Fiscal deficit is the excess of government expenditure over receipts. Higher fiscal deficit of a government would mean a higher borrowing requirement in a financial year. The borrowed funds may be spent by the state for various purposes, officials point out.

The 14th Finance Commission had recommended that states maintain their fiscal deficit within 3% of their GSDP. It also suggested that the fiscal deficit limit should be relaxed to a maximum of 3.5%, but subject to condition that if states were able to contain their debt and interest payments to specified levels.

Police also closed the parking facility and placed barricades on the road to prevent any parking, thus blocking almost half the road.

113,['4/03/2020'],Gujarat: Nayara Energy’s expansion plans face green challenge,"File picture of the refinery at Vadinar

AHMEDABAD: Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy’s (formerly known as Essar Oil) plans for expansion of the existing refinery and setting up a new petrochemical complex at Vadinar near Jamnagar seems to have hit a hurdle after some villagers alleged that the company did not follow due process to get environmental clearance.

Nayara Energy’s expansion plan includes setting up a 10.75 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA) capacity petrochemical complex and expansion of the refinery from 20 MMTPA to 46 MMTPA for a total investment of about Rs 1.3 lakh crore.

A clutch of people from villages including Gagva, Khavdi, Meghpar, Padana, Jakhar, Vadinar, Timbdi, Devadiya and Lakhiya objected to grant of clearance by the Ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) on the grounds that a public hearing was not held, said Dilipsinh Jadeja who filed a petition in the Gujarat high court. He is a resident of a village near the Nayara’s project.

The environment appraisal committee (EAC) under MoEFCC deferred the matter after it was approached by the company for environmental clearance, according to an interim order passed by the high court recently. The court order cites the statement of the senior counsel of the respondent which says that the expert appraisal committee is to convene a meeting between February 25 to February 27 but has deferred grant of environment clearance for Nayara’s expansion plans.

Jadeja said that the company’s plans for expansion in Jamnagar was earlier on the agenda of the EAC for February 26 but now stands deferred.

In August last year, a public consultation was held over grant of environmental clearance to Nayara’s proposed expansion plans. Local villagers and others to be affected by the project were required to send responses in writing to Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) member secretary till August 5. GPCB forwarded the responses to the MoEFCC for consideration of grant of EC, a government source said. This was perhaps the first time that GPCB chose the public consultation route instead of a public hearing, sources added.

“There are legal guidelines that needs to be adhered to while granting environmental clearance. These rules have been grossly violated in this case. Such projects always require public hearing and it can’t be through public consultation,” said Jadeja.

In August 2017, a Rosneft-led consortium acquired Essar Oil for $12.9 billion and it was later renamed Nayara Energy.

“Environmental clearance for the Vadinar project was valid till 2018. However, the proposed expansion was not carried out in the stipulated time-frame by the earlier promoters. The new promoters have decided to scale down the project. Also, no additional land was required for the expansion, hence the public consultation route was chosen by GPCB,” said a government official in the know of the matter.

“The internal committee has not been unanimous in providing a final report and I’m yet to get a separate report from one of the members.

AHMEDABAD: Two organizations — the Association for Protection of Civil Rights and Bharatiya Yuva Morcha — have been seeking Gujarat high court directions to Surat police to grant permission for continuous protests, similar to those at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi, in the Limbayat area of the city.

The petitioners’ advocate, Saquib Ansari, said protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) took place at a private place in the Om Nagar area of Surat. As Limbayat police continued to interfere with the programmes, the organizers requested the police inspector and then the police commissioner to grant permission to continue the protest programmes, though there is no need to seek such permission for a protest at a private place.

The police authorities refused permission for the protest on February 8, and this brought the organizations to the high court seeking direction to Surat police to grant permission. The petitioners also requested interim relief from the HC, to ask the cops not to interfere with protest programmes that are not at a public place.

The state government, however, opposed the petition stating that the area witnessed violence and a policeman was attacked in Limbayat during a Bharat Bandh programme to protest CAA. Some 200 people were implicated in the case. Considering this argument, Justice A Y Kogje refused to restrain police action, but sought a reply from the authorities in response to the petition.

The authorities were asked to reply by Tuesday, but the hearing was adjourned.

But for India, the proverbial elephant in the room are airports in West Asia, which are the most popular transit hubs for passengers flying into India. It’s there that India-bound passengers from airports in Europe, the US, and Africa would possibly mingle with those who have flown in from Iran and Italy before they board their onward connection.“For India, it’s critical to look into the possibility of India-bound passengers getting infected in transit hubs. A passenger typically spends at least 2-3 hours milling around with hundreds of other passengers, including those who have flown in from Iran and Italy,” said a senior airline official.For instance, eight direct flights from Tehran fly into Dubai daily, apart from six in total from Rome, Milan and Venice, bringing in over 3,000 passengers daily from these destinations into Dubai. Again, 17 daily flights link Dubai to Mumbai, the busiest international route into India. Apart from these, 12 flights from Dubai fly to Delhi, seven to Kochi, and six to Hyderabad daily.“Dubai airport gets the largest number of passengers from India. In 2019, 11.9 million passengers from India landed at Dubai and so, an equally large number would be flying out of Dubai to India,” said an aviation consultant. There are other West Asian airports like Doha, Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, and Riyadh where si-milar intermingling of India-bound passengers with those from Iran and Italy occur.The big problem with extending screening to passengers coming in from West Asian airports pertains to sheer volume. “It would greatly increase the workload of airport health organisations as the number of passengers to be screened would jump manifold. It would decrease the efficiency of detection as human factors like fatigue would set in. From Dubai alone, about 8,000-9,000 passengers would be flying into Mumbai,” said a medical practitioner with an airline.Dr Om Srivastava, an infectious diseases expert, held a similar view. “It’s not possible for medical staff to screen thousands of passengers day after day, without fatigue setting in. What is more realistic is to have a separate holding area for those travellers who may be of high risk, where they can be screened. Risk has to be identified. The rest of the passengers coming into the airport (should be) free to move on to their destinations. That way you are moving passengers fast.”Meanwhile, a video posted to the official Twitter account of Dubai airport on Tuesday said that passengers from known high-infection areas are being screened twice.

HYDERABAD: The state government on Tuesday appealed to the high court to allow it to go ahead with the construction of a new secretariat building in place of the existing one.

Advocate General BS Prasad listed out two reasons for the plea. The AG said that as the government wants to have an iconic structure befitting the stature of the state with all the state-of-the-art facilities, the courts cannot interfere in such policy decisions as long as they are not offending any of the constitutional provisions.

Secondly, he said, all the technical and cabinet committees that went into the issue had concluded that the existing secretariat buildings have become unsafe both in terms of safety of the inmates and security of VVIPs and VIPs. “It has to be demolished to pave way for a new modern administrative complex that will have conference rooms to accommodate meetings with foreign dignitaries and huge meeting halls for meetings with all the heads of the departments and district collectors from all the 33 districts,” the AG said.

The bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy commenced its final hearing in the two PILs filed by Congress MP A Revanth Reddy and TJS vice president Professor P L Vishweswara Rao challenging the decision of the state in this regard on the ground that the existing buildings will last for another 50 years and hence need not be demolished.

The bench heard the state’s objections on the two petitioners and sought to know from it if there is bar on political rivals from approaching courts on public interest matters.

Stating that these petitioners were in fact coming in the way of public interest matters, the AG said that they did not provide any evidence or documents that the existing buildings will last for a longer time. “With no proper passage, water leakages, loose wires, scattered parking and lack of space for separate VIP entries and many defects, the current structure is unfit to accommodate a secretariat,” the AG said, adding that except D and H blocks, all other blocks deserve to be demolished as they were useless.

Appearing for one of the petitioners, senior counsel S Satyam Reddy urged the court to reject the chief engineers’ report on the buildings and direct any central agency or IIT, Hyderabad to send their experts to assess the strength of the existing buildings. The bench posted the case to March 5 for further hearing.

Kochi: Hoteliers who used to discharge food waste and toilet waste to drains and canals will no longer be able to do so as the district administration has started closing these pipelines as part of Operation Breakthrough. Likewise, the pipelines which carry toilet from residences will also be closed.

District collector has given instruction in this regard and contractors have started closing the pipelines. However, residents have raised their objections and councillors are starting to feel the heat.

“Residents and hoteliers used to discharge waste water to drains without any objection from authorities so far. But, with the closing of openings, residents won’t be able to do so. Though we reason with them, they, especially housewives, get angry with us. We tell them the drains are meant for stormwater and residents cannot discharge waste into them. The problem is that 90% residents in Kochi do not have facility in their houses to discharge waste water. Similarly, the hoteliers have been discharging all food waste to drains and blocking them,” said Krishnakumar, Ernakulam south councilor.

District administration officials said they have asked workers to close all the openings from toilets to drains and canals. “If the residents raise the issue before the councillors, peoples’ representatives should make them understand that the drains and canals are not the place to dump toilet waste,” said an official.

Meanwhile on Tuesday, the district administration has approved 28 more new works to be undertaken in the second phase of Operation Breakthrough. Works in the second phase are estimated to cost Rs 16.5 crore. About 75% works in the first phase have been completed. Though the government sanctioned Rs 10 crore for first phase, only Rs 4 crore has reached the account of the administration, said sources.

“There’s no need for any concern about CAA or NPR. Kerala government will not implement them, but will carry out only the enumeration process required for Census 2021,” the CM said, responding to allegations by opposition members that his repeated statements against CAA and NPR lacked clarity and were misleading.

The opposition raised the concern during a discussion on demand for grants for different government departments in the state budget which began on Tuesday.

“The timeframe and enumeration activities for Census and NPR are different, and there will be no overt or covert traps (in the form of questions) in the house-listing operations for the census,” Vijayan said. It has been decided to convene an all-party meeting on March 16 to discuss and allay such fears, he added.

Reacting to opposition allegations the government was making false claims in various fields, including the tall claim under Life Mission, the CM said the opposition’s negative attitude towards these achievements by the government for the welfare of people and the state was ‘most unfortunate’.

“The opposition, instead of being proud of Kerala’s achievements, seems to be jealous and unhappy,” he said.

Earlier, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala alleged that the government was making tall claims through ‘paid news’ and was cheating people. Taking part in the discussion, he also termed the ongoing vigilance investigations into former UDF ministers a ‘witch hunt’.

Officials from family health centre in Payippad panchayat and the health inspector from Karukachal have also found out that the hospital was functioning without licence from the panchayat. The hospital does not have proper waste management system also. Officials who visited the hospital on Tuesday have submitted a report to the Payippad panchayat regarding this. The panchayat will hold a meeting on Wednesday to take a final decision based on this report, said panchayat president Swapna Binu.

Meanwhile, the medical board is awaiting the chemical analysis report of the autopsy of the last person who had died in the hospital. According to primary findings, the death has been due to pneumonia. The report from the chemical analysis lab will also bring out the truth about the allegation that the lead content in the medicines given to the patients was high.

JAIPUR: The ceiling of walkway in front of shop number 280 in Johari Bazaar was cracked three years ago and was supposed to be restored by the Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC). However, the civic body has not taken any action so far. The worst part is that the cracked ceiling is supported by bamboos, thus raising a security scare.

According to sources, the ceiling was cracked when the owner of the shop was doing some construction inside it. Later, the owner shut the shop but the cracked ceiling was still there. As per rules, verandas are supposed to be constructed by the JMC. However, several complaints to restore the ceiling fell on deaf ears, sources said. Shyam Mittal , a shopkeeper adjacent to shop 280, said that a few times these bamboos fell down in three years.

“Officials of JMC have visited the place many times, taken photographs but after that nothing happened. These bamboos have fallen two-three times after which shopkeepers have restored them at their expense to avoid any further causality,” said Shyam. The officials of JMC said that the issue is serious and they are taking note of it. Deputy commissioner of Hawa Mahal (East) Ramkishore Meena said, “We will look into the matter. It will be resolved in no time and I have asked the official in-charge to take note of this.” General secretary of Johri Bazaar Vyapaar Mandal, Kailash Mittal said that this is the negligent attitude of the JMC officials.

124,['4/03/2020'],Dog attacks violate human rights: PIL,"Picture used for representational purpose only

AHMEDABAD: A petitioner, Kirtikumar Bhatt, on Tuesday submitted before the Gujarat high court that inaction by of the authorities on preventing stray dogs from attacking humans is a violation of human rights and a violation of the UN Convention on Rights of the Child.

Based on Bhatt’s PIL, the HC issued notice to the authorities in January. However, Bhatt sought to add to his arguments and maintained that numerous dog attacks on people were a gross violation of the human rights of citizens of India. More than 17 million people suffer dog bites and about 18,000 people lose their lives to rabies every year in this country. The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, comes within purview of the Internal Security Division-III of the ministry of home affairs, reads Bhatt’s petition.

The petitioner further stated that majority of victims of stray dog attacks are children. The United Nations had brought out a ‘Convention on Rights of the Child’ in 1989, and India acceded to it in 1992. Thus, attacks and killing of children by strays is a violation of the convention, Bhatt argued. In his PIL, Bhatt sought directions to the city police commissioner and the municipal commissioner to use police forces to curb the stray dog menace.

127,['4/03/2020'],FC Goa juniors set the bar high,"Panaji: FC Goa’s Under-18 side have qualified for the AIFF I-League for the third consecutive season and are now gunning for the title.

In their first season, FC Goa were knocked out in the quarterfinals. Last year, they went a step further and made it to the last-four stage. They gave their all but lost by a solitary goal to eventual champions Minerva Punjab FC.

In the Goa qualifiers, FC Goa secured 17 points from eight matches, the same as Dempo SC, but topped the group with a better head-to-head record and qualified directly for the main round. They lost only once to Salgaocar FC, who finished third. Dempo too got through, but will have to play five more games in the qualifiers before the main round.

The All-India playoffs will be held in May and coach Gavin Araujo is training his boys at the artificial turf at Chowgule, Margao. He believes it will help them get accustomed to the surface in Shillong.

“We had strong teams for the last two editions and it is the experience that will count this time. Sometimes it is difficult to match the (physical) strengths of our opponents but technique bails us out,” Araujo told TOI.

The A-license coach who is with the club since 2015 could be right. Forward Joybert Almeida has come up from the U-13 ranks and is playing his third season in this age group. There are five others who have experience at this level which includes Rayan Menezes and central midfielder Brison Fernandes.

“I am with the club for the last three seasons and the club has taken good care of me. I wish to stay here longer and even help the club win the ISL title in the future, if I make it to the senior team,” said Joybert.

With Derrick Pereira as technical director, the U-18s follow the same philosophy that has helped the senior side become the most consistent outfits in the six editions of the Indian Super League (ISL). Short passing, possession and starting moves from the back has been the key to their success.

“Thanks to Derrick sir. He has aligned all our youth system to the first team, right from the style of play and formation. I think 18-year-olds are strong enough to play even against bigger opponents,” said Araujo.

Even if the juniors fall short, they have a lot of motivation and Mohammad Nawaz is a perfect example. The former India U-17 goalkeeper has made 32 appearances in the ISL over two seasons and has cemented his place in the senior side. Then there is Princeton Rebello, who also played for the U-18s.

Most of the players are keen to stay with FC Goa and brighten their chances of playing in the ISL. “We want to work hard and win the (U-18) I-League title for the club,” said Brison.

128,['4/03/2020'],Retail price of bottled water capped at Rs 13,"Thiruvananthapuram: The state government has issued an order capping the price of bottled water at Rs 13 per litre in the state. As per the order, no manufacturer can charge more than this retail price .

The government has issued the order regulating the price of the bottled water under the ambit of the Essential Commodities Act. The government has made it clear that there will be strict action against those selling bottled water at higher rates henceforth. As per the new rule, all bottles should have the price printed on it.

At present, one litre of bottled water costs Rs 20 in the state, and multiplex cinema theatres and star hotels charge a greater premium which varies between Rs 50 and Rs 100. The retailers also charge an extra amount for refrigerating the bottles.

Even though the state government had issued a notification declaring bottled water as an essential commodity (which gives it the authority to fix the MRP) much earlier, certain companies had approached the high court against it. “The high court, both single and division benches, ruled in favour of the government,” said food minister P Thilothaman.

With the government issuing the order, the manufacturing companies will have to stick to the MRP of Rs 13 while printing it on the labels, he added.

Over the last couple of years, the manufacturers and traders have been opposing the government’s move to regulate the price of bottled water, following complaints from public against retailers and hotels charging exorbitantly at will. Meetings were held after the government notified it under Essential Commodities Act, and traders pointed out that the railways was charging Rs 15 for ‘Rail neer’.

Once the price is fixed by the government, legal metrology officials can take action against traders selling it at higher price to consumers, the minister pointed out.

This is part of enhancing hazard vulnerability network in the state as there are several places where there are no weather monitoring networks to track rainfall, landslides, temperature and humidity.

Officials said while 100 stations are to come up, sites for installing 73 stations have been cleared and a government order has been issued. KSDMA officials said a team from the India Meteorological Department has been visiting the sites for final confirmation. “Each station would take at least 3-4 days to install. The IMD has assigned an agency for the purpose and they would be doing it simultaneously,” an official said.

The state government during its discussion had given priority to hilly regions, landslide-prone areas and dam sites. Hence, these areas have been included in the 15 sites where AWS would be installed in the first phase. Among the first lot, Peringalkuthu and Banasura dams have been marked. In Thiruvananthapuram, the model site proposed was at Ponmudy but when the team inspected, they found that the marked spot did not have mobile network and the site was moved a bit into the network area.

The sites have been identified with inputs from KSEB, irrigation department and Kerala water authority. Idukki district will get a total of 11 stations, of which nine have been identified including Cheruthoni and Peermade.

Meanwhile, construction of 14 disaster relief centres in seven districts is under way, with first three temporary disaster relief centres for victims of natural disasters expected to be ready by June. The centre can accommodate around 1,000 people and it is expected that the difficulties encountered by victims in relief camps have been addressed.

The places where the centres are coming up include Thazhava (Kollam), Cherutha and Mararikkulam (Alappuzha), Pallipuram and Thuruthippuram (Ernakulam), Kadapuram and Azhikkode (Thrissur), Vettam and Palapatti (Malappuram), Kathirur and Cheladu (Kannur), Kudlu, Pullur and Madoor (Kasaragod).

The construction site is being identified within 10 km of the coast and will function under direct control of the collector. There will also be a s helter management committee under the chairmanship of the local body. They will also have four groups of emergency response teams. The teams will be trained in shelter management, search & rescue, first aid and alert.

If you want to buy one, you can take it or leave it,” shopkeepers are telling customers who protest at the high prices.The surgical masks usually sold for Rs 10 in the retail market are currently being sold at Rs 40. The N95 masks that have multiple layers for better protection and re-use are being sold for anything between Rs 150 and Rs 500. “We are also paying extra to purchase the masks from suppliers,” said a shopkeeper, justifying the increased price.Online portals selling the masks and hand sanitisers said the demand for face masks, particulate respiratory masks, protective suits, sterile surgical gloves and safety goggles has gone up 10 times.Every time a patient coughs or sneezes, the droplets containing the virus are released and they tend to spread. Masks are advised for people who have symptoms such as coughing and sneezing so they don’t spread the virus causing the symptoms to others. However, healthier individuals also use it to avoid getting the infection, especially when visiting crowded areas such as hospitals or airports.Such is the crisis of masks that even health workers in hospitals are finding it difficult to get it. Resident doctors at Safdarjung Hospital, one of the nodal centres for quarantining and treatment of Covid-19 cases, have asked the authorities to ensure masks for all healthcare workers. “Healthcare workers are at maximum risk to catch the infection because they are directly in touch with patients. They need to be provided with all possible protective equipment to be able to work without fear or anxiety,” said a doctor.The spread of COVID19 has also increased the potential of drug crisis. To contain this, India, the world’s largest maker of generic drugs, on Tuesday restricted the export of common medicines such as paracetamol and 25 other pharmaceutical ingredients and drugs made from them.Though India is a source of about 20% of the world’s generic drug supply, pharma companies in the country are dependent on China for two-thirds of the chemical components needed to make them.The outbreak of coronavirus has shut factories in China and impacted supplies, leading to fears of a shortage of drugs and medicines.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74468207,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-52561,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/take-it-or-leave-it-price-of-masks-jacked-up-in-city/articleshow/74466555.cms

132,['4/03/2020'],College magazine’s bold theme stokes row,"Kannur: The cover page of People’s Cooperative Arts and Science College magazine is vivid with images: A banana partially sheathed in a condom. Behind it a woman’s face, which is part of peeling graffiti… peeping eyes… and the name ‘ Ura Marachathu ’ (hidden by a sheath). Its content revolves around issues related to sexuality , sexual aggression and even sexual orientation. Menstruation, rape and even lesbianism find place in the magazine.

Now, the magazine recently published by SFI-controlled union in the college located at Munnad in Kasaragod has invited criticism from the moral police because of its theme. KSU and ABVP have approached the Prime Minister, the governor and even Kannur University’s VC against the magazine.

Staff editor Anu Sebastian said the content, finalized after deliberations, were written by students as part of programme in memory of playwright Girish Karnad.

“Atrocities against women have underscored the lack of sex education. We wanted to bring the issue in public domain,” Sebastian said.

Sebastian said the response from girls was unprecedented as they dedicated their contributions to Kathua rape victim. When discussions were happening in 2018-19, issues related to sexuality, especially menstruation, in the backdrop of Sabarimala women entry was going on, said magazine editor Akash Pallam.

“In such a situation, we wanted the magazine to take a stand on such issues. Though the magazine committee organized a debate on Monday, those who criticized the magazine on social media were absent,” he said, adding that the provocative cover was deliberately chosen to highlight the society’s tendency to hide such issues.

The poem, Avarannere Kithachu (That day, they panted a lot) by Vineetha C, centres on the horrid feeling after rape while another girl, Ashwini C asks whether menstruation is impure. Illustration for articles has invited criticism and Reshma C’s fiction is based on the same issue. Another girl, Parvathi, delves into lesbianism present in the holy books, and how moral police decides everything. Arya A, who wrote about menstruation and related social issues, said it is time to debate such issues in public.

But, KSU Kasaragod secretary Martin Abraham said SFI has created an obscenity, which goes against women.

“We have filed a police complaint at Uduma. We have approached university VC, governor, PM’s grievance redressal portal,” he said.

Assistant professor Haritha Gopal felt that those, who termed the magazine anti-women, support patriarchy and they are obscene from within. “Swords are drawn against a magazine in which most contributors are women. They have raised a burning issue,” she said, adding that the lack of sex education and perversion of frustrated minds are the reasons for such objection. She added that society will reject the notion.

HYDERABAD: Revenue officials have claimed Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy and his brothers encroached upon 1.11 acre government land in survey number 127 in Gopanpally and 34 guntas in full tank level of Komatibanda kunta in neighbouring Rangareddy district. They also said there was a mismatch between the extent of land being claimed by Revanth Reddy and his kin and land in their actual possession.

Rajendranagar revenue divisional officer (RDO) K Chandrakala inquired into the issue on the directions of Rangareddy district collector Amoy Kumar and submitted her report on Monday. “While the land in survey number 127, purchased by Revanth and his brothers was 10.21 acres, the field verification revealed the compound wall with gates was coming to 12.02 acres,” the RDO said.

She said the compound wall was obstructing water sources to Komatikunta, which is against WALTA Act, 2002 and Section 24 of AP (TA) Land Revenue Act, 1317 Fasli. “To initiate action, the deputy collector-cum-tahsildar may be instructed to take steps,” she said. On the land purchased in survey number 127 in Gopanpally, the RDO said the sale deeds executed in the name of Dabba Mallaiah and his kin do not appear to be genuine and the vendors, who executed the sale deeds as members of Dabba family seem to be ‘impersonators’. “About 5. 21 guntas unclaimed property shall be treated as ascheat/bonavantia land, she added.

136,['4/03/2020'],"Redeem, Chothe to join FC Goa","Panaji: FC Goa have already started planning for next season with Redeem Tlang (NorthEast United FC) and Makan Winkle Chothe (Punjab FC) among the new signings.

FC Goa are certain to lose a few domestic players to other clubs as negotiations are now in the final stages. The Indian Super League ( ISL ) toppers don’t want to be found wanting and have braced for the exit with fresh signings.

Redeem, who did well with NorthEast United this season, was the first to agree a move to Goa, despite at least two other clubs seeking his signature. He could be an option for the new coach on the wing and his three goals with NEUFC suggests he is not hesitant to have a shy at goal.

The most exciting prospect, though, is Chothe. Just 19, and now a regular with Punjab FC in the I-League , the young striker from Manipur has won plenty of admirers at the youth level and is now beginning to show promise at the senior level too.

This season, he has already started 14 of the 15 games for Punjab FC and has been instrumental in guiding them to the second spot and has been among the goals too. NorthEast United were among the many clubs that were keen to have him on their rolls, but the bright prospect has been convinced that Goa is the best place to advance his career.

“We have a long-term contract with Chothe. We have all seen what he has done at the youth level and he has continued with the same form with seniors. He is an exciting prospect,” said a club official.

Chothe showed what he is capable of when he scored the match-winner against FC Goa in the Elite League 2018-19 semifinals at Nagoa ground. He also scored the opening goal in the final as Minerva Punjab coasted to victory. He also made five appearances for Minerva Punjab in the AFC Cup last season.

There will be more domestic signings, including a defender from the Goa Pro League.

138,['4/03/2020'],"Thanks to locals, it’s a clean sweep","Hyderabad: Not leaving the upkeep of the city to civic officials, volunteers have started taking matters into their own hands. Techies, doctors and even a pilot in training, are taking to the streets to help the civic body out.

One such group, comprising about nine core members and many volunteers, began their work last year. “We have already worked on six spots – in Miyapur, Kondapur, three in BHEL area and the most recent in Tellapur,” says Shrikanth Shankaran, who is training to be a pilot.

Shankaran says, “We focus on segregation of waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable material. After we complete that process we hand over the waste to Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation officials.” He says segregating watse itself reduces GHMC’s burden by half.

Explaining how a simple change can go a long way, Shankaran says if people just stop dumping their waste in knotted plastic covers, a lot of time and effort can be saved during segregation. The 26-year-old explains, “Often we find remnants of fruits and vegetables – which can be used for manure – dumped in plastic, which is known to non-biodegradable. Avoiding this must be the first step in proper waste management.”

Dr Vishnu Priya Cherukuri, working with the group, says most team members are professionals who volunteer in their spare time. “We all need to make time because every effort goes a long way in making a change.”

Other groups too have been focussing on waste management. Residents of My Home Vihanga in Gachibowli, for instance, have taken it up on themselves to remove garbage from their society. They rue how development work in surrounding areas has led to an increase in construction and demolition (C&D) waste in the locality.

Residents claim that the GHMC collects nearly Rs10 crore property tax from My Home Vihaanga. But not much is done in terms of waste collection.

Recently, residents launched a campaign titled ‘My Neighbourhood’ as they started clearing C&D waste in the locality . “There are close to 2,000 apartments here with a population of over 5,000 people. While we have been requesting GHMC to deploy three to four workers exclusively for our society, little efforts have been done to do so,” said RJ Singh, a resident of My Home Vihaanga.

Even after two years of running from pillar to post to get their drains cleaned by either GHMC or the railway authorities, residents of Dayanand Nagar have also begun to do the job themselves. “Due to poor drainage network in the colony, sewage gets accumulated under the railway tracks. While we were told that the drainage network will be extended and the situation will improve, nothing has been done so far. For the past two years, we ourselves have been cleaning the drains once a month,” said K Govind Narayanan, secretary of Dayanand Nagar Residents Welfare Association, which has approximately 3,500 people.

Similarly, yuder the group ‘Helping hands Humanity’, Prashant Mamidala and Satish Chandra have been trying to rejuvenate lakes. “We have been working on lakes from the past four years, with almost no response from officials. They bluntly tell us that there are no funds.” He says they have taken up three lakes: Annarayani cheruvu (Nagaram), Raa cheruvu (Boduppal) and Saroor Nagar Cheruvu.

So members of HHH, are getting their hands dirty, pulling out hyacinth with their bare hands. Said Satish Chandra, “It has been eight months since I have been personally following up on Saroor Nagar Cheruvu. We have seen people throw all kinds of garbage like plastic, waste material, construction material, Pooja items which are a pain to remove.”

Meanwhile, techie Amar Kokkanti (39) has been working alone with the GHMC to fill potholes. “I see complaints registered on the GHMC app and follow-up with officials. The idea is to make the officials accountable,’ he said. He started his work in 2018 has worked on several area such as the Hafeezpet flyover, Lingampally, Madinaguda, Miyapur, Kothaguda. “I have seen accidents take place before my eyes and ante to ensure the city is a safer place for everyone,” he said.

139,['4/03/2020'],"Woman’s body found buried in pit, police suspect husband","Thiruvananthapuram: In a suspected case of murder , the body of a 32-year-old woman was found buried in a pit behind her under-construction house at Valikkunnu Colony in Pullanpara village under Venjaramoodu police station limits.

Police identified the deceased as Sini, daughter of Chellappan and Lalitha. Her husband, Kuttan, who is missing is the prime suspect. The couple has two sons, aged 15 and 12.

Venjaramoodu police registered a case on unnatural death and are on the lookout for Kuttan, who is a daily-wage labourer.

According to police, the body was found by Sini’s cousin Rajesh on Tuesday afternoon. Her husband had spread news that Sini was missing from Sunday evening and Rajesh had come to search for her.

While checking out the rubber plantation behind the house, he noticed an unusual amount of dry leaves over the pit that was dug to construct a septic tank. As this used to be an open pit, he grew suspicious. He cleared the leaves and started digging, to expose her left shoulder. He immediately alerted the police, who rushed to the spot and dug out the body.

The body was naked. Apart from a deep wound on the forehead there was no other major injury. Police suspect that she might have been bludgeoned using a blunt object such as a hammer.

The deceased was found with eyes popping out and tongue tightly lodged between the teeth, suggesting strangulation. Police also found a plastic mat and a small knife from the pit.

Cops suspect the murder to have been committed in another house in the locality, where the family was living. This house belongs to Chandran. Kuttan and Chandran were substance abusers and had been involved in a brawl a few days ago. During that fight, Chandran threw an acid-like substance on Kuttan’s face, inflicting burn injuries. Chandran was arrested and jailed following the incident. He lived alone and after his arrest Kuttan and Sini moved into his house along with their children.

“We found primer (zinc chromate compound used in spray paint) stains on the body of the deceased. A can of primer was found at Chandran’s house and this led us to suspect the murder took place there,” said a police officer who inspected the crime scene.

The children told the police they saw Kuttan assaulting and even threatening their mother by brandishing a circular saw.

They also revealed that he used to harass both them and their mother under the influence of alcohol.

There were times when Sini went to her brother’s house in Kollam to escape the violence. And that’s where everyone thought she was when Kuttan circulated news that she was missing.

“We have learned that Kuttan has travelled to remote villages in Karnataka as part of his job and we suspect that he could have fled to one such place now,” said Venjaramoodu station house officer inspector Aji Chandran Nair.

HYDERABAD: With the cancellation of 16 MMTS trains between Hyderabad and Lingampally till March 7, and 15 MEMU and passenger trains running from different locations in the city affected by MMTS phase II work, passengers are switching to cabs.

“I work in Gachibowli and take MMTS regularly with my friends. Today, I accidentally checked the railway app in the morning to check for any delays and found that the MMTS we take was cancelled. We decided to take a cab pooling service but it cost us almost twice the amount we usually pay” Vignesh P, a resident of Kundanbagh, who takes an MMTS train from Begumpet to Hi-Tec City twice daily, told TOI.

Another MMTS user, Swathi, who works at a telephone exchange in Moosapet and takes the MMTS from Sanjeeviah Park to Bharatnagar daily, said, “My workplace is around 8 km away from where I stay and despite the delays, MMTS is still the cheapest and the fastest way to get there. And now, for the next five days, I will have to use a cab or an auto but either way it will ruin my budget”.

A huge number of techies travelling to Hi-Tec City and Gachibowli regularly are using car pooling options. While some of the passengers found out about the cancelled trains before reaching the station, some were still uninformed until they reached the station. “I just found out that a few MMTS trains are cancelled, and I don’t think I will be able to make it to my office in time,” said Piyush Sharma, another disappointed passenger who was at the Sanjeeviah Park MMTS station to board his train from Falaknuma to Lingampally at 9 am.

Other than MMTS, several MEMU and passenger trains from different locations in the city were cancelled. Among the affected trains too, some of the long-distance trains to Ballarshah in Madhya Pradesh and Howrah in Bengal were also partially cancelled and rescheduled in March, leaving thousands of passengers in the lurch. Passengers who have already booked their tickets are enquiring with railway officials for confirmation of the same. “Due to interlocking work for arrangements in connection with the quadrupling of track between Moula Ali ‘C’ cabin and Ghatkesar stations as part of MMTS works, some trains were cancelled, partially cancelled, diverted and rescheduled,” said a South Central Railway official, adding, “We are also replying to passengers’ queries over our helpline numbers and on social media.”

JAIPUR: Rajasthan University (RU) appears to be taking the paper leak matter reported on Monday lightly. Even though question papers of two subjects — Zoology and Mathematics of BSc second year — were out on social media at least 20 minutes before the commencement of the examination, RU authorities are reluctant to treat this as a ‘paper leak.’ Administration has informed the police about the leak but no FIR has been filed even after two days.

As per the university administration, Veer Tejaji College, Radawas put the paper on social media 20 minutes before the exam started.

Rajasthan University chief examiner controller Vinod Gupta said, “It will not be a leak as the students were already inside the classrooms. As per the norms, question papers are usually opened half an hour before the exam starts. Someone at the Veer Tejaji College, Radawas, notoriously shared the question paper about 20 minutes before the usual time of opening the question paper and posted it on social media.”

Gupta said that RU will file the FIR on Wednesday because police have asked for certain documents from the university and it is under process.

He further said, “We have debarred the college from conducting any further exams. However, till March 6, the exams will be conducted as per the schedule as we cannot change the centre on such a short notice or else the students will suffer. A university supervisor will be present during the exams. From March 7, the exams will be shifted to any other centre.”

144,['4/03/2020'],Not many takers at JDA’s PRN regularisation camps,"The JDA is organising camps to regularise 24 colonies in the scheme.

JAIPUR: The Jaipur Development Authority ’s attempts to fill its coffers by issuing lease deeds to Prithvi Raj Nagar residents are turning futile as not many plot holders are coming forward in regularisation camps.

The JDA is organising camps to regularise 24 colonies in the scheme. According to the sources, there are approximately 3,000 houses in these colonies. However, so far less than 200 people have applied and procured lease deeds. A source at JDA said, “The JDA has not even issued 200 lease deeds (pattas) so far. The major reason is that many plot owners have expressed helplessness in affording the cost.”

After JDA increased the development charges and regularisation fee, the plot owners got discouraged. Giraj Singh Khangarot , president of Prithvi Nagar Sangharsh Samiti said, “The people who have not taken lease deeds till date are really poor. The capable plot owners have already procured lease deeds. The government should be providing relaxation to these plot owners rather than increasing rates.”

The civic body has set a target to issue lease deeds to all the PRN plot holders till November 2020. Residents who will fail to procure lease deeds on time will have to pay double development and regularisation rates to regularise their plots.

BJP former councillor, Maan Pandit who is protesting against the increased rates said, “The people have understood the government’s intentions. The idea is to benefit the mafias and suppress the poor. Our government had decided to acquire land above 1,000 sq yards and develop the area by selling that land. However, the decision was reversed.”

For a 100 square-yard plot, JDA will charge Rs 300 regularisation charge (per square yard), which will include allotment rates. Similarly, for plot size between 101 and 300 square-yards, JDA will charge Rs 480.

The agency will charge regularisation rates of Rs 720 (per square yard) for plots bigger than 301 square yards and up to 1,000 square yards. Owners having a plot of more than 1,000 square yards will have to give 1.5 times regularisation charges.

For regularising a marriage garden in the scheme, which has been developed on a plot size above 2,000 square yards, the JDA has fixed Rs 1,500 (per square yard) regularisation charge.

148,['4/03/2020'],Crop loss in some districts may spike mango prices this season,"Vijayawada: Mango lovers will have to shell out a little more this year. Though the crop is in a much better state in the orchards of Krishna district, especially in Nuzvid region, compared to last year, crop failure in other districts in the state will spike the demand and price of Nuzvid mango variety.

Krishna district is home to one of the best mango varieties (Bangenapalli and chinna rasalu) that are exported in huge quantities to other parts of the country and also abroad. In Krishna, mango orchards spread over 70,000 hectares, including 24,000 hectares in Nuzvid region.

Speaking to TOI, assistant director, Horticulture department, Nuzvid, Ch Srinivasulu said the weather condition had helped mango production in Krishna district, but had bitten into production in Rayachoti (Kadapa), Prakasam, Chittoor and Vizianagaram districts. The average yield in the current season is over 5.5 tons per acre in Nuzvid region.

The current rate of the Nuzvid mango is anywhere between Rs 60,000 and Rs 65,000 per tonne. The price of the mango is likely to decrease to around Rs 35,000 per tonne in the peak mango season (April and May), Srinivasulu added.

In Vijayawada, the price of popular varieties of the mango (Bangenapalli, Totapuri, Rasalu) was ranged anywhere between Rs 400 and Rs 800 a dozen in the last season. Traders who export the fruit from Nunna Mango Market in Vijayawada to other parts of the state and country said mango lovers will have to pay more than last season to relish the fruit this year.

Compared to the previous year, mango yield in Krishna district has increased around 20 per cent in the current season. If a majority of the crop in Krishna district is diverted to other areas due to demand, there will be little left to meet the local demand, said D Dayakar Babu, assistant director of Horticulture, Krishna district.

“We relish the rasalu variety of mango. If the price of mango is beyond the reach, we will cut down the quantity of purchase,” says K Sangeeta, a resident of Vijayawada. The price of raw mango is around Rs 50, which is quite high this year. With the high prices of mango, many people can’t afford to buy raw mangoes to prepare pickle, she added.

Nagpur: It is almost surreal how an eye of Manish’s camera captures the beauty of landscape and nature at once. Manish Mamtani, a chartered accountant by profession, has taken the ‘game’ of photography to a high level. His clicked picture recently made it to the New Hampshire’s cover, a Visitors Guide published in USA in October 2019.

He focuses on work that reflects the beauty of landscapes, nature and greenery.

“It all started in 2010. I visited Yosemite National Park, California, in November of 2010 when I was still learning to use my first camera. I was awestruck by the beauty of this park,” said Mamtani.

His love for nature ventured him into photography. His work contains an array of different pictures, right from landscapes to breathtaking oceans and greenery. Some of his pictures also made its way to Nat Geo, Vanity Fair, Digital Photo, Digital Camera World and Better Photography Magazine.

“I started taking pictures and sent them to various photography groups on social media. I got a good response and people liked my style of photography. This gave me a lot of confidence and improved me. This is when I decided to enter photography contests,” added Mamtani.

His work has won several national and international awards and honourable mentions, including Black and White Spider Awards, Share the Experience, London School of Photography, and Windland Awards. His work has been published in several national and international media, including Huffington Post, The Telegraph, The Australian, ZME Science, Perth Now, Upworthy, NASA, The National Parks Calendar, TWAN and many more.

Mamtani has a strong social media presence with over a million followers worldwide. He plans to conduct photography workshops in India which will be a learning opportunity for budding photographers.

Sharing his views about the kind of his type of photography which makes him stand out, he said, “People often tell me that they identify my pictures and say that we know this is clicked by Manish. I click pictures in raw mode and want to capture in an exact way as I saw it with a naked eye.”

“I take landscape images to show how beautiful nature is and infrared images to show how I imagine this world to be. Aerial photography gives a completely new perspective to a place that is shot a million times. I call it a bird’s eye view photography,” added Mamtani.

Talking about his drone photograph which earned him a Nat Geo award, he said, “The image was selected as the Editor’s Favourite. The image was shot in New Hampshire.”

152,['4/03/2020'],Kin blame college for youth’s suicide,"Kozhikode: The family of final year BA Economics student of Malabar Christian College (MCC) Jaspreet Singh (21) — who committed suicide on Sunday after being disqualified from writing exam due to shortage of attendance — has said that it was the insensitive attitude of college authorities towards his repeated pleas to allow him write the exam, that led to his death.

His sisters, Balvind Kaur and Gurpreet Kaur, said on Tuesday that Singh had 68% attendance (as against the required 75%) as the family had to go to their ancestral home in Jalandhar following the demise of their grandmother.

“He had informed the college about the situation and had submitted documents before the college and university. Our father (Manmohan Singh) went to the college and pleaded with the teachers to show mercy. They were inconsiderate,” said Balvind, adding that the college did not even consider the medical certificate he had produced. When he approached the university, he was told that it was up to the principal to grant permission.

Manmohan, who was in tears, said, “I pleaded to give him one last chance, but they didn’t. Had they informed me six months ago, I would have gone and intervened. We were not even informed.”

Singh’s family, living in Kozhikode for the past 10 years, runs a hotel.

Meanwhile MCC principal Godwin Samraj said the college was following university regulations and Singh had utilized the 20% double condonation to make up for attendance shortage in the fourth semester.

“As it can be used only once, no further relaxation in attendance can be granted during the course. The student had not approached the college principal or the grievance cell after the semester attendance was published on February 7,” he said.

The principal denied the family’s allegation that a teacher from MCC had told him to ‘go to Punjab and write the exams’.

Though the principal can allow a student to provisionally write an exam, it would later lead to complications as the varsity will not publish the result, said the principal.

155,['4/03/2020'],"Like minerals, groundwater is state property, charge for it: Madras high court","Advocate-general Vijay Narayan submitted that the state has made a conscious decision not to charge extraction... Read More

CHENNAI: Groundwater is not less precious than minerals, so why can’t the government charge units that use water for commercial purposes?

Raising this pertinent question, the Madras high court said: “Like minerals, all the natural resources found under the ground are property of the state. We do not understand why extraction of groundwater is not charged when water is a scarce resource. The state cannot provide free meal to such industries particularly when they are commercially exploiting the natural resource.”

The division bench of Justice Vineet Kothari and Justice R Suresh Kumar made these observations after nudging the state government to seal more than 500 packaged water manufacturing units that were extracting groundwater illegally across the state.

Responding to the court’s query, advocate-general Vijay Narayan submitted that the state has made a conscious decision not to charge extraction of groundwater by packaged water manufacturers since it caters the drinking water needs of the people which the state could not provide. “Then what is the purpose of fixing flow meters to the extraction pumps,” the bench wondered.

To this, Narayan explained that meters are to check extraction quantity to cap ‘over extraction’ by manufacturers.

Narayan wanted the court to advise the manufacturers who are currently on ‘strike’ to have faith on the judiciary and that such ‘strike’ is not a good move.

Recording the submission, the bench said, “If they think it (strike) will put pressure on this court, then they are mistaken.”

Denying the submission that the units are on ‘strike’, senior counsel P S Raman submitted that the units could not work since they have been shut down by the authorities in view of court order. This fact was explained in a media briefing, but it was misinterpreted as strike, he added.

Earlier, Narayan explained the court that of the 261 units functioning across the state, extraction points in 124 units have been sealed and that the rest will also be closed soon. Taking the report on record, the bench observed that the manufacturers must be made to pay a price for tapping groundwater in the past without proper licence. “The past cannot be buried under the carpet,” the bench said.

Representing a group of manufacturers, Raman contended that the government has imposed adverse conditions only against packaged drinking water manufacturers whereas other water ‘raw water’ suppliers through trucks are still allowed to function.

He added that an appeal against the single judge order which upheld the government order pertaining to packaged drinking water units is already pending before the first bench of the court headed by the chief justice. Recording the submissions, the bench said that they would pass detailed order on Wednesday.

156,['4/03/2020'],Authorities brace for water woes in city,"Thiruvananthapuram: The city, which finds itself in the clutches of soaring temperatures, will need to brace for a sterner test with the upcoming Attukal festival, when lakhs of devotees arrive to offer pongala.

In order to cater to the water requirements to around 15 lakh devotees from outside the city, KWA is planning elaborate arrangements, which will result in water shortage in several areas. The worst affected will be the higher-lying areas.

Officials of the water authority’s south division expect around 15 lakh people to pour into the city for the festival. “The population of city is around 10 lakh. Arrival of an additional 15 lakh people means that we have to arrange double the quantity of water supplied per day. Several areas are already affected by water shortage,” sources said.

As part of Attukal pongala, KWA will stock up the 76-lakh-litre-capacity tank at Iranimuttam and the 100-lakh-litre tank at Vellayambalam. Several areas in the city will experience supply disruptions from March 6 to 9 as the authority diverts water from tanks in PTP Nagar and Observatory.

There will be partial disruptions in areas such as Vattiyoorkavu, Thirumala, Poojappura, Karamana, PTP Nagar, Nemom, Vellayani, Munnamoodu, Kodunganoor, Vayalikkada, Kallumala, Pappanamcode, Vellayambalam, Sasthamangalam, Vazhuthacaud, Jawahar Nagar, Kowdiar and Nandavanam from Friday.

On pongala day, on Monday, more areas will experience partial disruptions due to stocking of additional water in the low-level tank at Vellayambalam. This will result in a partial disruption in Vazhuthacuad, Thycaud, Valiyasala, PMG, Statue, Bakery Junction, Pulimoodu, Ottukuzhy, Manjalikkulam Road, Ayurveda College, Palayam, MLA Quarters, General Hospital, Pettah and Veli.

In 2013, a major pipe burst disrupted water supply in the city on the eve of Attukal pongala, which triggered conspiracy and sabotage rumours. Following this, KWA has taken to stocking water in advance. It will also provide water in tankers to pongala areas. KWA will install 25 tanks, 1,270 temporary taps and 50 showers in festival areas.

On not being answered properly to the questions put up by the MLAs during Questions Hour, Joshi, while showing strictness on the ministers, himself went ahead and clarified the question and instructed the ministers that instead of beating the bush they should answer to the question straight.

Senior ministers Shanti Dhariwal, B D Kalla, Govind Singh Dotasra and Pratap Singh Kachariyawas were at the receiving end for the speaker on Tuesday.

Parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Dhariwal could not give a straight answer to the question by Sandeep Sharma. Speaker then intervened and asked the minister that instead of repeating things, you should give a direct answer.

Joshi said the question is due to delay in the disbursal of pension of retired employees, the government had to pay Rs 50 lakh as interest, and what action was taken against the officials responsible for it.

The minister said the junior accounts officers on election duty were the reason for the delay. Stating the figures, he said that 1,865 cases of fixation are still pending, out of which 852 cases are added in 2020. Similarly Minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas caught on the backfoot while replying to a question of Ganesh Godhra, on the re-introduction of Grameen Sewa buses in rural areas in Dungarpur district. The minister said rural transport service was discontinued by the BJP government. Leader of Opposition Gulabchand Kataria intervened saying the question is about the number buses presently operating and the time line of reintroduction of the remaining routes. The minister instead of giving the figures started reading out the routes where services were stopped.

The speaker dissatisfied with the reply, proceed to the next question. On the question of Amritlal Meena related to delay in disbursal of fees outstanding of BPL children in private school in Salumbar for the academic year 2019-20, education minister Govind Singh Dotasara told that the amount of Rs 138.47 crore fees outstanding left by the previous government was the reason for the delay in payment, the speaker said the minister is not replying to the question. Dotasara finally had to say that the fees due of 302 children for the year 2019-20 will be made by April.

SECUNDERABAD: A section of residents were irked over the Ministry of Defence’s (MoD) failure in recognising closure of roads in the Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) limits in a question raised in the Rajya Sabha on March 2.

Andhra Pradesh MP Vijayasai Reddy sought details of closed roads in various cantonments across the country. The MP questioned whether it is a fact that due to road closure, general public are finding it difficult as they cannot pass through cantonment roads since barriers, checkposts and roadblocks have been installed by the Army.

While the response by the MoD did mention road closures in Bareilly and Amritsar cantonments, it did not find any mention of those closed in the Secunderabad cantonment. “It is a glaring error by the minister not to include these illegally closed roads in Secunderabad in his reply. It indicates a totally cavalier attitude of the defence ministry to this critical issue which affects lakhs of civilians daily,” said Jeethender Surana, secretary of All Cantonments Citizens Welfare Association.

According to a letter issued by the SCB to the MoD in 2018, Rajendra Singh ji road network, Hislop – Amherst road network and Gough road network are among the few roads which have been closed by the local military authorities. Commuters allege that the closure of arterial roads by the local military authorities results in long detours.

Residents living in Sainikpuri and its surrounding areas have sought a special board meeting by the SCB on the road closure issue. “Many roads closed in Secunderabad and they are no strategic importance; many running through the Golf course. Close down the golf course and open the roads,” tweeted ML Agarwal, a resident.

BHIM QR codes at wine shops will be available and consumers can just scan to pay online. This apart, point of sale (PoS) machines that are available at shops in Chennai and neighbouring districts will be provided across Tamil Nadu.

164,['4/03/2020'],Pune activists demand civic body cancel MRI machine tender,"Picture for representational purpose only.

PUNE: Activists have slammed civic health officials for wasting taxpayers’ money by issuing a tender for buying a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine when the MRI scan service was already available at two PMC-run hospitals for the benefit of needy patients.

The activists said the civic body had entered into an agreement with a private agency for starting diagnostic services, including MRI scans, for needy citizens at affordable charges in 2017 under the public-private partnership model.

Since then, the private agency has installed MRI machine at Kamla Nehru Hospital in Mangalwar Peth and works are on to install another at Sutar hospital in Kothrud. Besides, PMC-run Pote hospital in Padmavati has been providing MRI scan service to the needy patients.

“We demand immediate cancellation of the tender and suspension of the officials concerned. The officials had been highlighting the waiting period for the scan at the two civic-run hospitals for buying the new machine, which is a big lie. There is no waiting period at the Kamala Nehru Hospital and the waiting period at Pote hospital is five to six days against 10-15 days as claimed by the health officials,” activist Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagarik Manch, an NGO, said.

He said as per the December 2017 agreement, it was the private agency’s responsibility to install the MRI machines, each unit of which costs around Rs 10 crore. “The officials should first finish the work in hand and see how it works. They should pull up the private agency for taking so long to install MRI machine at Sutar hospital,” Velankar said.

“Besides, such a service kicked off at Pote hospital three years before the 2017 agreement, for which another private agency was appointed to run the MRI scan service after purchasing a machine,” he said.

As per the proposal, the civic officials intend to purchase and install the MRI machine at Rajiv Gandhi hospital in Yerawada before roping in another private agency for providing the service. “Though the municipal commissioner asked the officials to submit the action plan within 15 days for the service, they did not do so. Instead, the health officials quickly floated the tender for buying the MRI machine after the proposal was approved on February 4,” Velankar said.

Anjali Sabne, assistant medical officer of health and head of the purchase at the PMC’s health department, said, “As per the city’s geographical distribution, there has to be four to five PMC hospitals offering MRI scan service to curtail long commute and waiting period. We are going to purchase and install the machine at Rajiv Gandhi hospital, for which a private agency will be roped in to offer the service as per the CGHS.”

166,['4/03/2020'],"NGO blames NMC, traffic cops for ignoring its study report","Nagpur: Non-functioning of pedestrians’ signals, hawkers occupying roads and parking of vehicles within 50 meters of intersections make several roads of the city, including the Variety Square — the most chaotic junction, vulnerable to accidents, according to a study carried out by an NGO, Janakroash.

The NGO involves in creating traffic awareness that supports the government for an efficient and safe traffic management system. The NGO, which has carried out an exhaustive study on deficiencies at traffic intersections, submitted its report to mayor Sandip Joshi.

The report said the NGO has always been acting as eyes and ears of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and traffic police. This has been done with an aim of reducing accidents and not for playing any blame game, the report said.

NGO vice-president Ashok Karandikar said the NGO had done a survey on about 80 intersections of the city a few years ago and submitted its report to the NMC and the DCP traffic office. There was no effective response from the then officials in charge, he said.

“This time also the NGO carried out study of intersections like Variety Square, Samvidhan Square, Chhatrapati Square, Wanjari Nagar TB Ward Square, Samrat Ashok Chowk, Agyaram Devi Chowk etc. The study found several deficiencies on these intersections like absence zebra markings or its poor visibility, stop lines, defunct pedestrian lights and timers. The deficiencies further point out the illegal parking of two-wheelers and autorickshaws at the intersection and the bus stops in the proximity of intersections,” he said.

The study has also exposed how the NMC’s ignorant attitude to finish cement concretization works has turned most intersections in the city into accident-prone spots. “On several newly constructed roads, the intersections remained at lower levels than connecting roads causing risk of water accumulation in rainy season and of accidents,” the report said.

“These deficiencies due to non-development of intersections to match the newly constructed roads level have also remained unattended. If inaction is due to different ownerships of roads, it is time NMC took charge as a nodal authority,” it said.

According to the study, the intersections which need immediate attention included three on Central Bazaar Road, Bajaj Nagar Chowk, Shankar Nagar Chowk, Omkar Nagar Chowk and Shatabdi Chowk.

The NGO also urged the mayor to ensure that the NMC should take proactive measures to eradicate these deficiencies for the safety of people driving on city roads.

170,['4/03/2020'],"Rehabilitate polluting households, corp told","Thiruvananthapuram: The monitoring committee set up by the state to review progress of national green tribunal (NGT) cases has directed the city corporation to identify households and establishments, located near waterbodies, which discharge effluents into canals and rivers.

Chief secretary Tom Jose, chairman of the committee, stressed the need to identify them and arrange alternative locations for their rehabilitation at a review meeting held here on Tuesday. The district administration which undertook a survey as part of the project to revive Parvathy Puthanar had identified 1,700 households along the Kovalam-Akkulam stretch which require rehabilitation.

In April 2019, the corporation was asked to rehabilitate 8,050 households near Karamana river without septic tanks and which have been diverting sewage to the water body. In a meeting convened by chief secretary in April following a spot visit by NGT’s state-level monitoring committee, the corporation was directed to take preliminary steps towards rehabilitation of households without septic tanks. It was estimated the corporation would have to acquire 48 acres of land for the purpose. This assumes importance as the civic body is already facing difficulties in purchasing land for the Life Mission.

Sources said a major issue in forcing residents to move is that many of them had been given title deeds by the government in the past, in a way giving them legal right to reside near waterbodies. The civic body will have to be backed by various departments and the government in its move to identify households located close to waterbodies and initiate steps for rehabilitation.

Around 18,000 landless beneficiaries were identified under the Life Mission within corporation limits and over 8,000 have received homes so far. The meeting also decided to engage consultants for the preparation of DPR as part of laying sewage line in areas near polluted waterbodies. KWA has been directed to ensure a sewer network in the city in such a way the treatment plant at Muttathara works to full capacity. A DPR of the Rs 1,400 crore project will also have to be prepared.

Rejuvenation of Karamana river and Killiyaar through a series of short-term and long-term measures is expected to cost over Rs 1,500 crore.

172,['4/03/2020'],Former bureaucrats question lack of NPR data confidentiality,"Picture for representational purpose only.

PUNE: A section of former bureaucrats and retired government officials has flagged the possibility of lack of confidentiality of the National Population Register data as against the Census.

The Census Act makes it compulsory for the government to keep the data collected during the process confidential. But there is no such requirement for the National Population Register (NPR) data under the citizenship rules, according to the office of the Registrar-General and Census Commissioner. It clearly states, “Certain information collected under the NPR will be published in the local areas for public scrutiny and invitation of objections, and some data will be shared for the verification purpose.”

A retired bureaucrat said, “A local register at the level of a tehsildar is supposed to give a decision on a citizen in the verification process, which we oppose vehemently.”

Some former bureaucrats and senior officials stated that there had been much confusion about if the Census and the NPR exercises were the same.

A former retired government official said the confusion arose partly from the government’s decision to conduct the exercises together, from April to September. Though they are completely different — in purpose and origin — there has been an attempt to pass them off as “similar” or “same”.

The bureaucrats in an open letter earlier had stated that the data collected during the NPR would be used for determining citizenship.

Retired IPS officer Meeran Borwankar , who along with 73 former bureaucrats had issued a letter opposing the NPR drive, told TOI that while the Census was a time-tested process, the NPR was not. “I am personally against the NPR as I see a lot of harassment of the poor and marginalized sections of society,” she said.

According to a September 2019 notification of the Union home ministry, the enumerators appointed for the Census would also update the NPR. But apart from the house-to-house data collection, there was hardly anything common in the Census and the NPR, said a government official.

Senior government officials claimed that the data collected for Census gives a demographic and socio-economic population of the country, while the sole purpose of compiling the NPR is to create the National Register of Citizens .

JAIPUR: The House witnessed heated arguments during budget discussion on sports when independent MLA Sanyam Lodha mentioned former RCA president Lalit Modi for holding cricket administration to ransom.

Deputy opposition leader opposed comment on Modi as he was not a member of the House, while Lodha said since the discussion is on sports, there will be mention of RCA. The normalcy was restored after Rajendra Pareek ordered for deletion of Lalit Modi’s mention from the House records.

Lodha accused the previous BJP government of deleting the provision of domicile for contesting sports bodies’ elections. First, the provision was waived for father (Lalit Modi) and then for his son (Ruchir Modi).

He said the result of the decision was RCA was dragged to the court for years and the interest of the players were hurt.

He also lauded the efforts of the Ghlot government and now RCA president Vaibhav Gehlot for his efforts to strengthen cricket infrastructure in the country.

Deputy opposition leader Rajendra Rathore objected to the mention of Lalit Modi and Vaibhav Gehlot who were not members of the House leading to heated exchanges between the ruling and opposition.

CHENNAI: The Tamil government on Tuesday informed the Madras high court that it is considering banning single-use plastic wraps used to pack fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and other products. At present, such plastic wraps are exempted from the ban against single-use plastic.

“Plastic used for packing are single-use plastics and throwaway type. Such packing medium gets discarded instantaneously once the unpacking is done, as it finds no other use. As a result, use of plastic in packing goods sealed prior to use and their instant disposal significantly contribute to generation of plastic waste which has not reduced despite ban on other single use plastics since January 1, 2019,” additional advocate general Arvind Pandian said.

In view of the reasons and the directions of the court, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) has made a recommendation dated January 28, 2020 to consider removing the exemption provided to single use packaging plastics, Pandian added.

Recording the submission, a division bench of Justice S Vaidyanathan and Justice P T Asha observed that the state government has to give up the practice of supplying Aavin milk in plastic covers and follow the old method of using bottles or any other means.

The state should find new and innovate ways in phasing out plastic products, the bench added.

Adding that surprise inspections were being conducted across the state by TNPCB. Outlets including KFC, McDonalds and Starbucks were issued show-cause notices for not complying with the orders, Pandian said.

Recording the submissions, the bench suggested that students should appointed as brand ambassadors on rotation basis to create awareness against use of plastic products.

The bench added that the authorities shall place instructions in front of churches, mosques and temples on the implementation of the plastic ban. Shops selling offerings in places of worship should be instructed about using the traditional storage materials like baskets, paper bags, jute bags, plantain or other leaves, the bench said.

Three more visiting professors will be coming to the university over the next few months from Belgium, Australia and Sri Lanka as part of the varsity’s plan to expose its students to the best minds in the world.

“This is the beginning of a new chapter in Utkal University. In the last couple of months, our students got to listen and learn from internationally-acclaimed professors. Students are exposed to classes that have a different teaching pedagogy, style and content,” said said vice-chancellor Soumendra Mohan Patnaik, on the sidelines of a two-day international conference on Science, Society and Politics in South Asia here on Tuesday.

“To take this exposure to the next level, we have decided to rope in more visiting faculties for different subjects and schools,” he said.

The university has signed MoUs with foreign universities for exchange of faculties. He said these professors would be adjunct professors in Utkal University and would keep on giving their expert advice in the days to come on curriculum upgradation or future references.

The university has also decided to start capacity development training for faculty and non-teaching staff of the university. They will be trained on how to teach better, how can students learn better and how to collaborate better in research and development. They will also be trained in an advance module for better teaching methodologies and advance use of ICT across departments.

176,['4/03/2020'],BDA hopes for AAI nod to tallest tower,"Bhubaneswar: The Bhubaneswar Development Authority (BDA) is hoping to get approval from the Airports Authority of India (AAI) for its ambitious multi-modal hub project, supposed to be the tallest and iconic landmark in the city. The tower, which is part of the smart city mission, is expected to come up over 12 acres at Master Canteen square near the railway station.

As per plan, the height of the building is supposed to be 80 metres (25 floors), but this had come in for scrutiny from the AAI, given that the proposed building is within 3 kilometres from the airport and could pose a problem for flights. Initially, the AAI had given clearance to a 40m-tall building. The BDA again approached AAI for approval of the remaining 40m, following which a survey was carried out.

Officials from the AAI, Bhubaneswar airport and BDA visited the site earmarked for the project.

“Officials of the Air Traffic Control (ATC) surveyed the area. Since the airport is around 3km from the site, the AAI had cited technical reasons given that high rises often pose problem to flights. But, from their assessment, we feel we will get the approval for the entire 80m tower,” BDA planning member Gouri Shankar Bhuyan said.

The ambitious project is called a multi-modal hub because of the confluence of three modes of transport — train, cab and bus. Besides, two huge towers of 80m height will be developed which will have multiplexes, shopping malls, high-end hotels, amphitheatre and recreational facilities. This area comes under Bhubaneswar Town Centre District (BTCD), a demarcated area, which has been planned to be developed as the down town of the smart city.

In 2016, the BDA had signed a MoU with Singapore-based Jurong Consultants India Limited to develop the multi-modal hub, which will cost around Rs 1,000 crore. The East Coast Railways is one of the major stakeholders of the project.

BDA officials said the multi-modal project will also include retail outlets and malls, nature plaza, landscape, town plaza, art plaza, experience plaza and children’s plaza besides food courts, service apartments and cycling tracks.

179,['4/03/2020'],Nature and wildlife in myriad hues,"Thiruvananthapuram: There was no better day than the World Wildlife Day to kick-start the exhibition of photographs by John T L. The photographs that capture nature and wildlife in myriad hues, displayed at Museum Auditorium, will take the spectators to the mesmerizing dense forests.

The three-day exhibition is part of John’s mission to promote the message of protection and preservation of nature and wildlife. “I earnestly feel that it is the duty of mankind to protect and preserve the beauty of our Mother Nature. We may have to pay a heavy price for any damage caused to her, because once it is lost, it is lost forever,” said John.

His trips to forests and ecological hotspots proved that human interventions such as contamination of oceans, plastic waste, agriculture expansions and unplanned eco-tourism schemes have done more harm to the nature that anyone could estimate.

Photos, including that of a tiger cooling off in a lake, a white tiger eyeing a distant prey and playful moments of flocks of migratory birds, have been captured by John over five decades.

John is a trained artist and painter. During his student days itself, he became passionate about photography and enrolled as the disciple of renowned nature photographer T S Lal. The lessons he picked from Lal proved to be worthy when he joined the University of Kerala as an artist and photographer. During his 32-year-long career, he had worked in Botany, Marine Sciences, Zoology and Aquatic Biology departments.

After his retirement in 1997, John took up wildlife photography as a full-time p hobby and continued his travels and adventures. He is also a recipient of Lalithakala Academy Award in 2011.

The exhibition at Museum Auditorium will conclude on Thursday. The gallery will be open for public from 10am to 6pm.

184,['4/03/2020'],‘India’s democracy a challenge to Beijing model’,"Former foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale

PUNE: Former foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale on Tuesday said a strong democracy, economic development and strengthening of the country is the biggest challenge that India can pose to China. India has a paucity of scholarship on China, he added.

Gokhale was speaking at the inauguration of a seminar on ‘India China Relations in the 21st century: Challenges and Opportunities’ organised by Centre for Advanced Strategic Studies , Centre for China Analysis and Strategy, and MES Institute of Management and Career Courses on Tuesday.

“Democracy is our greatest asset which presents a challenge to the Beijing model. Our success in building our national strength through the democratic process makes it ideologically difficult for China to justify its idea of non-elected leadership. This is the single greatest challenge the Chinese government faces. Therefore, even though we are militarily backward compared to them, even though we are economically weaker, India represents the largest ideological challenge to China because of our democracy. They would like to see our democracy fail,” Gokhale said.

He called for lesser dependence on China for raw materials, intermediate goods and capital goods.

“There is no substitute for serious economic growth. We need to re-engineer our policies so as to ensure that we attract companies (willing to leave China) to India. We need to emulate China in building independent R&D and cutting edge technology,” he said.

Gokhale said the Chinese feel that India is unlikely to develop independent military capabilities to rival them for the next 25 years.

“Military modernisation is vital. We are lagging behind in manufacturing military hardware, especially new means of warfare. If we cannot make defence equipment of a certain quality and if we cannot ensure that we get uninterrupted supply of defence equipment in spares, there is a serious limitation on whether we can take on the Chinese beyond a certain time,” he said.

He stressed on reviving relations with Russia , which, according to him remained the only supplier of defence equipment and technological know-how during India’s crunch time. Gokhale said a stronger relationship with the US is a must but on equal terms.

Gokhale said China may follow two strategies with India.

“A soft approach by lessening tensions and making tactical concessions to prevent us from tilting towards the US and remaining neutral would be their plan. The second option would be to build pressure through military and security means at the line of actual control, the border in the northeast and through Pakistan,” he added.

In the first phase, as many as 500 beggars have been sent to shelter homes called Niladri Nilaya from where they will be rehabilitated and efforts will be made to bring them back to the mainstream.

“Six Niladri Nilayas have been opened in the town, each with a capacity to accommodate 50 people. They will be provided free food and shelter. The mental and physical health of these people will be checked and after assessing their conditions, the next course of action will be taken,” said Prasanna Kumar Patra, an officer with the Puri municipality.

Official sources said many of these beggars are from outside the state, while some are physically and mentally challenged and have been abandoned by their family members in Puri. There are also leprosy patients and drug-addicted people.

“Begging is a complex thing. Many people are into begging due to circumstances, many after losing their mental balance while there are some who do it for their love for Lord Jagannath. So we have to first segregate them into different categories like elderly, physically and mentally challenged. We have been asked not to use force on anyone and counsel them to quit begging,” said Patra.

For those from outside the state, the district administration is trying to find their identity and address so they could be sent back to their families. There are also plans to provide them skill training as per their abilities so that they can be brought back to the mainstream. “But this will take time,” admitted one official source.

The court had to decide if the cow’s owner can be considered to be a consumer or not.

The court made a swift and technical verdict: Turning down the farmer’s case, it upheld that the case was untenable as he had purchased a live animal and not an inanimate product or taken any service!

As the case details have it, Dabhoi farmer, Fulji Patanwadiya filed a case in the consumer court demanding Rs 32,000 to be paid to him for a Gir cow he had purchased from Naran Rabari was not ‘milking’ as claimed. According to Patanwadiya’s complaint filed in December 2016, Rabari, a cattle-rearer from Dabhoi, had claimed that the cow gives 7 litres of milk daily and is also lactating.

Not only relying on Rabari’s claim, Patanwadiya got it inspected by a familiar cattle inspector, and then paid Rs 32,000 on August 10, 2016 to Rabari and took the cow home with him. However, a few days later, Patanwadiya’s noticed that the cow gives only three litres of milk in a day. he also found out that the cow was also not lactating as told. The expenses he incurred in its maintenance and fodder was higher than the money he could earn by selling three litres of milk, he alleged.

Patanwadiya then sought his money back from Rabari asking him to take his cow back. But Rabari refused. Aggrieved, Patanwadiya approached the court to intervene so that he can get back Rs 32,000 along with 18% interest and compensation worth Rs 40,000.

Taking cognizance of Patanwadiya’s complaint, the court issued notice to Rabari who appeared for himself and even filed a reply to Patanwadiya’s notice. Rabari told the court that Patanwadiya had purchased the cow after getting it properly checked by a cattle inspector known to him and so, the complaint filed against him is false.

After hearing the two sides, the court concluded that Patanwadiya does not come under the definition of a consumer as per the Consumer Protection Act.

“Since the forum does not have authority to hear the matter as the complainant is not a consumer, it is proper to cancel the case,” the forum stated.

BAREILLY: A young couple committed suicide by consuming poison on Tuesday morning in their respective houses after their families opposed their relationship in Roza area of Shahjahanpur district.

According to the police, the girl was 19-year-old while her lover was 24-year-old. Both belonged to the same community. The couple was in a relationship for the past two years.

According to sources, Ramniwas, a resident of ITI colony in Roza, used to work in Roza mart as a labourer. He was in a relationship with his brother’s sister-in-law, who lived in the same locality.

However, his family members wanted him to marry elsewhere as they didn’t want to marry both the sons in the same family. The couple tried hard to convince their families, but couldn’t find any success. Meanwhile, Ramniwas’s parents had started searching for alliances for him.

On Monday night, Ramniwas reportedly met the girl and came back home. Later, he went to sleep without having dinner and on Tuesday morning, he was found dead. Similarly, the girl was also found dead in her house.

After getting information about the incident, police arrived and tried to seize the bodies, but both the families refused to give the bodies for autopsy.

Forensic experts also arrived to ensure that there was no foul play. Later, the bodies were sent for autopsy after a local representative mediated between the police and the aggrieved families.

Roza police station Station house officer Ashok Pal said, “It seems to be a clear case of suicide. The family members of the couple refrained from saying anything about their children’s death, but the residents told us that both the deceased were in a relationship and wanted to marry each other. We have sent the bodies for autopsy and waiting for the report.”

Notably, since 2017, nearly 48 couples have committed suicide in Bareilly after their families refused to solemnise their marriage.

RAMPUR: A local court in Rampur on Tuesday rejected the bail pleas of Samajwadi Party MP Azam Khan , his wife Tazeen Fatma and son Abdullah Azam in connection with a forgery case.

Azam Khan and his family members will remain in Sitapur jail under the judicial custody till March 20.

Senior Samajwadi Party (SP) leader and Rampur MP Azam Khan, his wife Tanzeen Fatimah and son Abdullah Azam were sent to judicial custody of six days on February 26 after the trio surrendered before the court in Rampur in a case involving the alleged forging of Abdullah’s birth certificate.

The accused were booked under sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Abdullah allegedly submitted incorrect date of birth certificate while filing his nomination papers for the assembly election. Following a high court order, he lost his membership of the state assembly last December after he was found guilty of forgery.

Meanwhile, police have sought 10 days custody of Azam Khan and his family in a case registered against them for allegedly forging documents to acquire land for his Mohammad Ali Jauhar University .

The investigating officer, sub-inspector Suresh Veer Singh , informed Additional District and Sessions Judge Dhirendra Kumar Kamboj that the accused persons are not cooperating with the investigation.

The court has fixed March 7 for the next hearing.

District government counsel Dalwinder Singh claimed that during the preliminary investigation it was found that Azam had forged documents to acquire a land falling under the Enemy Property Act.

The Enemy Property Act, 1968 is an Act of the Parliament, which enables and regulates the appropriation of property in India owned by Pakistani nationals. The ownership in such cases is passed to the Custodian for Enemy Property, usually a government department.

PUNE: As many as 15 to 20 establishments came under the anti-encroachment drive conducted by the Pune Municipal Corporation ( PMC ) on Jangli Maharaj Road and Fergusson College Road on Tuesday.

Several personnel from the department, policemen, an earth mover and several trucks were part of the drive. According to Rajesh Ingole from the department, the squad walked on both the roads to pull down encroachments.

“Banners, standees and other advertisement material displayed in the front margins of stores were confiscated. Illegal constructions along the side margins and front margins of buildings were razed. Several eateries running in temporary structures in the side margins were brought down. Stalls encroaching upon footpaths were removed and the material confiscated,” Ingole said.

An employee of an eatery that was brought down on Jangli Maharaj Road said, “The PMC often razes temporary sheds that are built to cover the eatery. They confiscate the tarpaulin and bring down the bamboo structure.”

Ingole said the front and side margins of buildings are meant for parking. But, they are occupied illegally at many spots along both the arterial roads.

“Some complaints have been received regarding the illegal structures as well. So, we decided to conduct a drive across both roads,” Ingole said.

Eateries are up and running soon after such drives raising questions about the effectiveness. On sighting the squad, encroachers along the roads and footpaths moved their wares to avoid action. Stalls encroaching upon the footpaths close to Garware bridge on JM Road removed temporary sheds and moved back to prevent losses.

No action is taken against the building owners for permitting encroachments on the side margins, Ingole said. Owners of the confiscated material can get their belongings back after paying the fine.

PILIBHIT: Two rare species of wildlife – Rusty spotted cat and Coral red kurki snake-- were spotted by chance in Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) by field director H Rajamohan while passing through the forest area during routine monitoring.

The Rusty spotted cat, the smallest member of the cat family, was spotted in Mala range while the Coral red kurki snake was sighted in Haripur range, said Rajamohan.

In 2018, the snake was spotted in Sonaripur forest range of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve.

The Rusty spotted cat is classified as “near threatened” in the Red list of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The field director has ordered forest personnel to collect all possible details about this tiny cat in PTR so that a conservation plan for this rare species is worked out.

Citing wildlife reports, he said, this cat is nocturnal by nature. It is just 35 to 45 cm in length and weighs about 1.5 kg. Its survival is being threatened due to the loss of its habitat. Its first picture was captured 10 years ago by the camera traps installed in PTR for the tiger census. But the cat not seen again since then.

“Now, it has been spotted after a decade. It needs to be conserved because it is listed in schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. This little carnivore survives on insects, birds and rodents,” Rajamohan added.

Till date, the Coral red kurki, he said, was seen in DTR and in Chitwan National Park in Nepal that has contiguity with the Valmiki Tiger Reserve in Bihar.

“Like Rusty spotted cat, this snake is also nocturnal in nature and normally preys on earthworms and larvae. Its innate characteristic is to remain underground most of the time. It is rarely seen on the ground in day hours,” Rajamohan said. The Coral red kurki is listed in schedule IV of the Wildlife Protection Act.

PUNE: Nearly 60% employees of the Pune Municipal Corporation are not covered under the biometric attendance system as they did not register for it.

After the introduction of the five-day-week system from Monday, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to expand the biometric attendance system to cover all the 15 ward offices in six months. The tendering process for procurement and installation of machines will be done in a week.

“Once the tenders process is completed, the remaining machines will be fitted. The staffers not registered with this system will be added to it,” said Shriniwas Kandul , the head of the civic electricity department.

He said some of the ward offices implemented the project on a pilot basis. These ward offices, along with the others, would be equipped with biometric attendance machines. The staffers would be monitored as per to the new timetable that came into effect from Monday, he said.

One of the operators of the biometric attendance system said, “It is an online system and the attendance is monitored through a software. Its access is given to the heads of the respective departments. Datasheets of arrival and departure timings are generated through this system. This data is used for paying salaries to the staffers. Some updates in the system software are due to make it foolproof.”

As per contractors, nearly 160 machines were given to the PMC two years ago. Some of them are not functioning now due to technical glitches and are being repaired. The machines would be upgraded and additional gadgets would be installed.

The civic administration had started a project to launch Aadhaar-based biometric system after a man was caught posing as a PMC employee. The system was aimed at doing real-time monitoring and was integrated through text-based communication channel.

JAIPUR: BJP is brainstorming to zero in on a Rajya Sabha (RS) candidate that can give maximum political mileage to the party in the state. The saffron party has discussed five probable names prominently pushed by different pressure groups like RSS and former chief minister Vasundhara Raje in its first round of talks ahead of the polls scheduled this month.

Elections for three RS seats from the state will be held on March 26. The outgoing RS members on these three seats are from the BJP whose term will be ending in April 2020 are – Narayan Lal Panchariya, Ramnarayan Dudi and Vijay Goel.

The state has 10 RS seats in a total of 245 seats in the upper house. Since BJP has lost the assembly polls in the state with 79 MLAs in its kitty, BJP will able to retain one seat out of three. The names making rounds are former state presidents—Ashok Parnami and Arun Chaturvedi. Other names include former Jhotwara MLA Rajpal Singh Shekhawat , former minister Prabhu Lal Saini and former Nagaur MP CR Chaudhary.

“The discussion is in the initial stage and names which come to the fore have been floated from the different power centres in the party. It is true that the final decision would be taken by the party high command but the recommendation from the state will be highly considered,” said a party source. It is also reported that BJP state president Satish Poonia had discussed the names with the RSS leaders and the latter has showed agreement that state leader would strengthen party more than any outsider.

BAREILLY: A girl and her beau were arrested on Tuesday for allegedly killing a 28-year-old man, whose charged body was recovered near Kumar cinema hall in the heart of Bareilly city on Monday.

Bareilly SSP Shailesh Pandey had announced a cash reward of Rs 15,000 to solve the case within 24 hours.

According to police, victim Yogesh Saxena was killed because his girlfriend Uma Shukla wanted to get rid of him and marry Sunil Sharma, who is a storekeeper at IVRI Bareilly on contractual basis.

Uma, who was living separately after she filed a dowry case against her husband in 2014, was in a relationship with Yogesh for the past eight years.

Uma wanted to marry Yogesh, but he told her that her elder sister was unmarried and asked her to wait.

“Uma wanted to get rid of Yogesh and asked him to come to an abandoned area near his shop at 9.30 pm on Sunday where Sunil was waiting. Sunil sprayed red chilli powder in his eyes and slit his throat with a sharp knife. Thereafter, Sunil left the place and met Uma outside a private hospital. Later, both of them came back to the murder spot to ensure that Yogesh was dead. They then burned the body with petrol,” Pandey said.

He added, “Additional SP (crime) RK Bhartiya, along with SHO Kotwali Geetesh Kapil, and their teams did a remarkable job solving the case within 24 hours. We have also added section 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) under the Indian Penal Code against the accused because they attempted to dump the dead body by burning it.”

BHUBANESWAR/KENDRAPADA: The crew member of a cargo ship and his wife, both Indian nationals, were admitted to the isolation ward of SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack on Tuesday for the suspected novel coronavirus (COVID-19) after they showed symptoms of mild fever.

The ship “Chemstar Stellar,” a chemical tanker sailing under the Panama flag and carrying 24 crew members and their families reached the Paradip coast on March 1. They were quarantined as the the ship had touched Zhapu in China (February 8), Onsan in South Korea (February 12) and Singapore (February 24) during its journey.

“Since the couple showed symptoms of fever, they have been moved to the isolation facility in Cuttack from Paradip on Tuesday while others on board remain in the vessel and will be under observation,” said Ashok Paikray, state surveillance officer.

Hospital authorities said the condition of the couple is stable. “They are being treated for their symptoms. The couple’s blood and throat swab samples have been collected. These will be sent to National Institute of Virology, Pune, by the Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC) in Bhubaneswar for further tests to rule out COVID-19. They will be here till their test results come in the next three to four days. Future course of action will depend on the test results,” said Bhubanananda Maharana, emergency officer at SCB.

Paradip Port Trust (PPT) authorities said there is no impact on cargo handling at the port because of the development. “The ship was allowed to anchor at the port to unload 20,000 metric tonne of sulphuric acid. On berthing, the health officials boarded the vessel and examined all the crew members as per protocol. As a precautionary measure, no crew member is allowed shore access because of the vessel’s travel history. However, there is no impact on the development of cargo handling work in the port,” said Rinkesh Roy, chairman of PPT.

Daily update of health status of crew has been made mandatory for all the vessels during their stay in Paradip. “People of Paradip are being made aware about the symptoms and preventive measures, through messages displayed on big electronic boards in the township,” Roy added.

The state government on Tuesday decided to increase vigil on possible cases. “The director of medical education and training have been asked to keep close watch on the situation. While there is no reason for people to panic, the government is focusing on greater awareness and stricter vigil,” health minister Naba Kishore Das said.

216,['4/03/2020'],Decent pay hike for teachers likely: Bihar deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi,"Sushil Kumar Modi

PATNA: Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi on Tuesday said the state government would soon make a “respectable” increase in the salary of around 4 lakh contractual (Niyojit) teachers, who are on strike for the past 16 days demanding pay parity with regular teachers.

“It was the NDA government, which had earlier increased their salary, and again we will make a respectable increase in their emoluments,” Modi said in the state legislative council. He was responding to a debate on the third supplementary budget for FY 2019-20.

SuMo urged the striking teachers, who are demanding ‘equal pay for equal work’, to return to work as the state government has declared its intention to hike their salary.

Earlier, several opposition members raised the teachers’ strike in the council and urged the government to accept their demands to end the stir in the interest of lakhs of students whose copies of Intermediate examination are not being evaluated because of the strike.

“CM Nitish Kumar has already declared that the state government would make a ‘respectable’ increase in their salary. Today, I announced it in the council. Now, teachers should return on their duty,” Modi told TOI over phone.

However, on being asked whether the state government was ready to accept the striking teachers’ demand of ‘equal pay for equal work’, Modi said there was no relevance of such demand in the wake of the Supreme Court’s order in this matter.

In a landmark order passed on May 10 last year, the Supreme Court had refused to regularise the services of contractual teachers and set aside the Patna high court ruling that they were eligible to get ‘equal pay for equal work’.

A bench of Justices Abhay Manohar Sapre and U U Lalit, while allowing the plea of the Bihar government challenging the October 31, 2017 high court order, had also declined to treat contractual teachers on a par with regular teachers.

The apex court had said the Bihar government was justified in having two different streams or cadres for teachers and there has been no violation of the rights of the 'Niyojit' (contractual) teachers nor has there been any discrimination against them.

The SC, however, raised concern over the emoluments made available to the contractual teachers at the initial stage and suggested that the state government may consider raising the scales of such teachers at least to the level suggested by the three-member committee.

Around 4 lakh contractual teachers are on an indefinite strike since February 17 to press for fulfilment of their 8-point demands, including equal pay for equal work and old pension scheme.

PUNE: The minimum temperature at Shivajinagar dropped marginally below 15°C on Tuesday, making it one of the coolest spots in Maharashtra .

Shivajinagar’s minimum temperature stood at 14.9°C on Tuesday against 15.7°C the previous day.

Citizens welcomed the slight chill returning to Pune amid expectations of a soaring mercury in March. Working professional Sayali Inamdar said, “After an usually warm February, I was expecting nights in the city to get warmer. But, it got quite cool last (Monday) night.”

Ahmednagar, Nashik, Malegaon , Nanded and Shivajinagar (in that order) were the coolest spots in the state on Tuesday early morning, with minimum temperatures at 13.1°C, 13.8°C, 14.4°C, 14.5°C and 14.9°C respectively.

An India Meteorological Department (IMD) official said the drop in night temperature was a result of clear sky conditions prevailing during the night hours. “Lack of clouds causes the terrestrial radiation (emitted from the earth’s surface) in the night to escape directly into the atmosphere. Conversely, when skies are cloudy, they hinder the passage of this radiation into the atmosphere, causing it to linger closer to the earth’s surface. Hence, cloudy skies are generally associated with high night temperature,” the official added.

When it comes to Lohegaon , the minimum temperature stayed at 17.5°C on Tuesday as against 17.7°C on Monday.

In the next few days, the minimum temperature in Pune is expected to stay between 15 and 16°C, while the maximum might hover between 33 and 35°C, stated the IMD forecast.

PUNE: A couple, who went to the Khadakwasla canal for a bath on Tuesday morning, drowned after being swept away by the strong currents.

222,['4/03/2020'],Jaipur: What’s in a name? Artisans of Bagru discover it the hard way,"Representative image

JAIPUR: A trademark threat is looming over artisans practising the 400-year-old craft of Bagru block printing from the namesake village near Jaipur.

The block printing technique has created the identity of the village where generations of artists have been practising it for centuries.

But now an artisan, belonging mostly to the Chippa caste (a community of painters), has been served a legal notice for using the word ‘Bagru’ for selling his product.

The notice was sent by one Hemant Kumar Sethia , who claimed that he had acquired the ‘trademark’ in 2008 under the Trademarks Act 1999, and that no one is allowed to use the name while selling any cloth material. The artisans of Bagru have countered the claim and said that they have already received the Geographical Indication (GI) certificate in 2009.

The block printing method is used to produce cotton fabrics, including bedsheets, suits, sarees, table cloth and other such material.

Speaking for his client Sethia, lawyer Ashok Kumar Sharma said that he had registered the trademark a year before artisans of Bagru.

“They got the GI certificate a year later. My client has done nothing wrong as when he registered the trademark there was no such one in the market. We are not objecting the practise of the craft by them as it is ancient, but they cannot use the name. It is hampering our business and my client is facing financial losses. The rights of my client are protected under the law. They have to sell their products under some other name,” Sharma said.

Padam Shri awardee Ram Kishore Derewala, a Bagru artisan, said that the delay in getting the GI tag does not make the claim of Hemant Kumar Sethia valid.

Artisans of the village will be completely destroyed if this claim is allowed to stand. More than 10,000 people are involved in this multi-crore business for centuries. How can a person trademark a name of the village? Our livelihood is dependent on this. This is the specialty of Bagru and a man from outside the village or our community cannot get a trademark for it. If he thinks that our claim is not valid, he should have objected to it in 2009 when we got the GI certificate. We will take appropriate legal action,” Ram Kishore said.

However, reacting to the claim and counter claim Bagmisikha Phuan, an intellectual property rights lawyer based in Delhi, opined, “At the outset, The Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999, prohibits the registration of geographical indication as a trademark. Section 25 of the Act clearly states that an interested party may move the Registrar of Trade Marks for the invalidation of the registration of a trademark which contains or consists of a GI, whereby such usage is likely to confuse or mislead the persons as to the true place of origin of such goods or class of goods.”

“In the present situation, the usage of the trademark is misleading. The artisans may choose to file a rectification petition under Section 57 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, and seek the cancellation of the trademark registered incorrectly,” she said.

223,['4/03/2020'],"Pawar opposes any move to hand over probe to CBI, ED, I-T","Nagpur: Rejecting all allegations made against him in the multi-crore irrigation scam, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar once against opposed any move to hand over the probe to central agencies like Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Enforcement Directorate (IT), Serious Fraud Investigating Office (SFIO), and Income Tax (I-T) Department.

Ahead of next week’s final hearing into the PILs filed by petitioners Jan Manch and Atul Jagtap, Pawar, who is respondent No 7, asserted that no exceptional case was made out by petitioners for handing over the probe to central agencies.

Earlier, the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) had opposed the handing over of the probe to CBI, ED, SFIO and I-T stating that it would hamper its ongoing investigations. It added that it was working diligently and registered many offences against contractors and VIDC officials through its Special Investigations Teams (SITs) in Nagpur and Amravati divisions.

Justifying his demand, Pawar, in his latest affidavit filed before Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court this week, stated that change in the government after assembly elections can’t be the ground for change of investigating agency. “When the petitioner has full faith in investigating agency earlier, how has he lost faith after the change in the government?”

Questioning the locus standi of Jagtap, Pawar claimed he was himself the contractor and had filed many tenders in various projects. “The petitioner shouldn’t use courts for settling personal scores. He’s having a mala fide notion of a scam which is yet to be proved. The courts can’t look or supervise investigations and also can’t direct that particular person should me made an accused.”

Denying Jagtap’s allegations that probe against Pawar wasn’t being conducted properly, the three-time deputy CM said, he was being questioned and interrogated on September 11 last year, and also made to provide written replies to questionnaire. “The petitioner shouldn’t have biased approach as investigations against him were conducted during previous (BJP) government and various FIRs against contractors were lodged in their tenure. I can’t be called on to answer every question, as I am not made as an accused in any complaint so far.”

Rejecting allegations that he had interfered in the ACB’s working, Pawar said there was nothing on record to prove it. “The petitioner has decided to don the role of investigating agency by pointing out the defects and contradictions in probe which are completely imaginative. The PILs are filed with a motive of troubling me. Every HC order is complied by the government and even SITs are constituted accordingly.”

Stressing that there are no inconsistencies into affidavits filed by ACBs Nagpur and Amravati superintendents and another by its director general Parambir Singh, Pawar said arraigning a person as an accused based on the mala fide intention is a clear violation of his fundamental right.

PAWAR SPEAK

* No exceptional case was made out by petitioners for handing over the probe to central agencies.

* Arraigning a person as an accused based on the mala fide intention is a clear violation of his fundamental right

* Every HC order is complied by the government and even SITs are constituted accordingly

* Petitioner shouldn’t have biased approach as investigations against Pawar were conducted during previous (BJP) government and various FIRs lodged.

The event, organized by India To Italy (ITOI), along with Indo-Italian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in collaboration with Cept, Ahmedabad Management Association, and GIHED was to be held on March 12.

It was only on Tuesday that the Union government suspended the visas of travellers from Italy, South Korea, Iran, and Japan with immediate effect in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak in these countries. “The speakers could not travel to the event and therefore we had no choice but to call it off,” said Jaydeep Desai, a co-founder of ITOI. “It is unfortunate that the effort of so many institutions was in vain.”

The outbreak has wrecked travel plans of many and key international events have also been cancelled. The Milan Furniture Fair — attended by architects, businesspersons, designers, and developers in Gujarat — was to be held by the end of April. The event has been postponed to June.

“While hotel bookings were non-refundable, flight ticket cancellations will come at a huge penalty,” said Parag Pandya, an executive who works with a dealership of Italian furniture brands in Ahmedabad.

MEERUT: Mohammad Aftab (21) wanted to open a wielding shop near his home in Noorpur area of Bijnor. So he went to Delhi to learn the work. On the first day of his job, Aftab went missing. His body was fished out from a drain on Monday evening, taking the total number of people from west UP killed in Delhi riots to 10. Aftab disappeared on February 24 evening from Shiv Vihar. A week-long frantic search ended on Monday evening when Aftab’s body was identified by his brothers at the mortuary in Delhi’s RML hospital. He was the youngest among 10 siblings.

Helplessness was writ large on the faces when Aftab’s body was brought back home in Noorpur.

His brother Mohammad Furqan said, “Aftab had left Noorpur on December 20. A Bijnor-based man, Danish ran a welding shop in Delhi’s Shiv Vihar. Aftab’s aim was to learn welding work so that he could set up a shop at Noorpur.”

February 24 was his first day at work, he said. “That was also the last day when we spoke to him over phone,” Furqan said.

“His co-workers told us that they were at the shop in Shiv Vihar area when a mob appeared on the street. They pulled down the shutter and fled. But, Aftab got stranded there,” he said.

Furqan further said, “We are six brothers and four sisters. Aftab was the youngest. On Monday, we got a call from RML mortuary. A few bodies were brought there. The staff called us to identify the body and we rushed. It was very difficult to identify the body, it had decomposed. We identified Aftab by his clothes and a mole on his chin. There were red spots near his eyes. Hairs from the head were missing. It was not clear what had happened to him. He was a victim of hatred,” Furqan said.

“We had asked him not to go to Delhi and concentrate on study here. But, he knew that family requires money,” he added.

On Tuesday evening, the body of Aftab reached Shahid Nagar colony of Noorpur. He was laid to rest later.

MEERUT: An association of city marriage hall owners has slammed what it said “sealing notices” served by the civic body to them and said the matter of legitimacy of 124 banquet halls is still pending before the high court.

The notices seeking explanations from the 124 “unauthorised” banquet halls were served after the Allahabad high court issued contempt notice to Meerut Development Authority (MDA) and sought details of action taken against the halls. On July 12 last year, the court had directed the MDA to act against the illegal marriage halls while hearing a petition filed by Meerut resident Sachin Saini. However, the civic body failed to follow the order.

The court has now set March 5 as the deadline to comply with the order.

Meanwhile, MDA has denied launching any sealing drive, as of now.

Speaking to TOI, vice chairperson of MDA, Rajesh Kumar Pandey said, “There is no sealing drive as such. Only notices have been issued. They (the owners) will be given an opportunity to give their replies. We will present the status before the court on Thursday, and will follow whatever orders are given by the court.”

The court had observed, “Having considered all the facts, we deem it appropriate to direct Meerut Development Authority to take all necessary penal steps against ‘baratghars’, including the one established before 2008, if they are not adhering to norms.”

At present, 163 marriage halls are operational under the jurisdiction of MDA, while another 93 fall under Cantonment and Housing Development Board administration. Interestingly, out of the total 163 halls which come under the MDA, only 24 have their maps sanctioned by the development authority.

Meerut Mandap Association general secretary Vipul Bansal said, “MDA issued notices and gave us just two days to explain our position after which they will begin sealing our properties. This move is illogical. Even when someone is laid off from a job, he is given at least a month notice. Besides, there is no contempt here because the case we had filed is already pending in the court so how can there be any contempt. We will fight in the court.”

Out of all these baratghars, only 24 were established after getting the map sanctioned by the authority. 139 baratghars out of 163 are in operation at places which don’t have approval from the MDA.

RAJKOT: A repeat of last year’s tragic fire in Surat , which snuffed out 22 young lives , was averted in Jamnagar when fire broke out in a homoeopathy clinic and thick smoke engulfed the tuition class where 12 students were present.

At around 12:30pm, fire broke out in the clinic located on the first floor Radhe Krishna Avenue, a commercial complex near B-division police station. The smoke spread quickly and engulfed Super Gravity Classes adjacent to the clinic.

Nine boys and three girls, who were attending Class X classes, got panicky and started screaming for help seeing thick plumes of smoke. In the meantime, Ajaysinh Zala , a constable with Jamnagar local crime branch (LCB), who was passing by, heard their shrieks and saw some of the children even preparing to jump from the first floor. He rushed to their help and convinced them not to jump.

The children were not able to come out of the front side gallery of the building due to heavy smoke and there was no other exit. Zala immediately climbed a concrete cabin outside the building and placated the children. He asked them to assembly on the extreme left and then started bringing them down one by one.

“The three girls were extremely scared and traumatized. They even refused to place their leg on my shoulder from the building and asked me to come up instead.,” Zala told TOI.

Within 15-20 minutes, all the students were brought down safely and none of them had any injury or health complaints.

The fire brigade also reached the spot and doused the blaze.

“The fire broke out due to short circuit. There was no one in the clinic when the fire broke out, but entire furniture and other items including medicines were charred,” said AK Bishnoi, chief fire officer, Jamangar.

Bishnoi said after the Surat Takshashila Arcade fire, all commercial buildings were given notices to install fire safety equipment.

“Only some shops had fire extinguishers but there was no such fire fighting equipment in this building. Even the tuition class did not have the equipment,” he added.

BHOPAL: Workers in Bhind district were pleasantly surprised when they came across a centuries-old structure while they were busy digging land for the construction of a park on Monday.

Archaeology department officials are yet to visit the site, but local residents say that the structure apparently looks like an ancient temple. Deputy director of state archaeology, Gwalior , K L Dhabi said, “We have received information about a structure that was found while land was being dug for the construction of a park in Bhind district. Our teams will visit the site and it is only after the visit and inspection that we would be able to disclose anything .”

“It is suspected that the structure belongs to the 16th or 17th Century when the Rana dynasty ruled in Bhind and nearby areas. But, these are just guesses and things will only be clear after inspection of the site,” Dhabi added.

Sources said that inside Gohad municipal body premises, there is a temple. Land was being dug using JCB machines for the construction of a park adjacent to the temple, when a tractor got trapped as soil caved in. The ground below it was hollow and labourers were startled to find an entire structure below it. It is roughly 100ft by 100ft in dimension and has engravings along its walls and seems like a temple.

231,['4/03/2020'],Gujarat: Only 14 per cent doctors hired by government take up offer,"Representative image

GANDHINAGAR: Only 14.40% doctors with the MBBS degree join the government sector after being appointed by the state government. Over the past two years, 2,228 such doctors were hired but only 321 took up the offer.

Deputy chief minister and health minister Nitin Patel said that among the reasons for not joining government service was the doctors’ pursuit of advanced degrees. He said that Gujarat does not have enough medical colleges so students were forced to go to other states to study.

Patel said to ensure that doctors with the MBBS degree serve in rural areas, the government has reduced the tenure of rural service from three years to one year. Also, the surety bond to enforce rural service had been set at Rs 20 lakh in 2019; it was previously only Rs 5 lakh.

Patel said that the government has to recover the bond amount from 3,000 doctors who had failed to serve in rural areas. He said that in many cases, the addresses were wrong or the doctors were not traceable. “The government is taking the issue seriously and will find these doctors and recover the money,” he said.

Patel said that the government has decided to sell property or land of the defaulting doctors. Congress MLA Dr Anil Joshiyara said that the government has been repeating the reply for long and has failed to find a solution. Patel said: “This reply was given even by the Congress in 1990 when it was in power. With the increase in medical seats, there will be some respite.”

The government’s reply reveals that 28 doctors joined government service in Banaskantha, followed by 27 in Valsad. In major cities such as Ahmedabad, of the 15 doctors given appointment, only four joined. Officials said that in Chhota Udepur, 138 doctors were appointed but only four joined. In Dahod, 293 were appointed but only 16 joined.

Gautam, who is a member of Meena Manch — girls’ activity group aimed at improving school enrollment and spreading awareness on various issues — had stopped a child marriage in her family by spreading awareness that education is important and that a girl cannot get married before 18 years.

The award is given by the Uttar Pradesh government to honour girl students who have worked to promote education and other awareness activities.

Talking to TOI, Vanshika said, “It is a matter of pride for me that the state government recognised my efforts. Nearly a year ago, I had intervened when my paternal aunt started thinking of marrying off my 16-year-old sister. It was only after I convinced her and my entire family that they cannot get her married before the age of 18, and that they should rather encourage her to study, that they agreed.”

Kumari Priyankar, officiating warden of Kasturba Gandhi Avasiya Vidyalaya, said, “Vanshika has been called to Lucknow on March 5 along with other girls from the state where they will be felicitated for their efforts. It is a matter of pride for the school that our student is going to be honoured at the state level.”

BARWANI: A woman and her six accomplices were arrested for allegedly faking her kidnapping and taking money on pretext of marriage in Sendhwa Rural police station area of Barwani district .

Sendhwa Rural police station in charge Vishwadeep Singh Parihar said that the woman, Laxmi Kirade, her mentor Rekha alias Uma, Rajesh alias Guddu, Sunil, Mukesh, Shahid Pinjara and mastermind behind the crime Satish Solanki have been booked under sections 420,177and 182 of IPC.

The accused were produced before a local court from where Mukesh, Sunil and Satish were sent on police remand for three days, while the remaining accused were sent to judicial custody.

On February 18, a case of kidnapping of a minor girl was registered against one Anil, a resident of Nandada near Shirpur in Maharashtra and Balu Arya, a resident of Julwania in Barwani district, Parihar said.

“During investigation, we found that the girl Laxmi Kirade faked her own kidnapping. She was not even a minor and had duped Anil of Rs 60,000 on pretext of marriage,” said Parihar.

When Anil along with Balu was taking Laxmi at his home for marriage, Laxmi called Dial 100 and lodged a complaint of assault, kidnapping and threat to life. Subsequently, police arrested Anil and Balu, he added.

“Laxmi is originally a resident of Sangvi village near Julwania. She was married in Rajasthan, but she came back. In Jhabua too, this gang had cheated a family. An application has been submitted in court under section 169 of the CrPC to close the case against Anil and Balu, police said.

After announcing adjournment in a case, RERA dismissed the complaint on the grounds that the party did not remain present, the petition said.

The petition was filed by an Uttar Pradesh resident, Yusuf Jamal, who booked a property in a building project by East West Developments Pvt Ltd in Shilaj. When the developer did not supply the unit to Jamal in time, he dragged the firm to RERA in Indore last year. The matter was transferred to the Gujarat RERA.

According to Jamal’s advocate, Amiraj Barot, as the developer did not put up any construction, Jamal filed a complaint. There was a hearing before RERA on December 11, 2019, but he received an email on December 9 that proceedings were adjourned till December 17.

When Barot went to attend proceedings on December 17, he was told that the case had been dismissed as default on December 11 because nobody turned up on behalf of the complainant. The lawyer supplied a copy of emails he received from the official email ID of RERA, to prove that his case was wrongly dismissed.

The petitioner requested the HC to quash the RERA’s order of dismissal and direct it to initiate proper action against the developer within the stipulated three months.

The HC sought a reply from RERA and the developer in two weeks’ time, the petitioner’s lawyer said.

235,['4/03/2020'],Green court orders govt to check sewage disposal in Chennai,"Chennai: National Green Tribunal on Friday ordered the Tamil Nadu government to monitor disposal of sewage and garbage, following a report on alleged illegal dumping of waste into the already polluted Buckingham canal.

The colonial-era canal, which was an important inland waterway a century ago that also served the purpose of checking cyclone risk, is severely polluted due to continuous dumping of waste and ‘development’ projects have narrowed its width at many places making it unusable. Efforts to clean up have been unsuccessful.

Taking cognizance of a news report of trucks dumping garbage into the canal, the tribunal asked the city corporation and the state pollution regulator to inspect the Shollinganallur region and submit a report.

“The committee shall also furnish the mechanism that is being adopted by the local bodies to monitor the transport of sewage and garbage and also report on any mechanism to register the tankers with them,” the NGT said in the order. It also said the committee, which would also include the PWD and water board officials, must ascertain if trucks collecting waste are getting permission from local governing bodies, and action being taken against violators.

“Authorities must have some mechanism to supervise carriage of sewage water to the Sewage Treatment Plants and if any violation is brought to their notice, then they will have to take necessary steps to punish those persons,” the court said in the order.

The report cited by the NGT alleged that sewage was being directly discharged and disposed in the Buckingham Canal without treatment. “If water bodies are affected, it will automatically affect the ecology apart from affecting the health of people. They play a great role in protecting environment,” the court said in the order.

The NGT said the committee must probe allegations including dumping of waste collected from OMR and ECR without treating them at sewage treatment plants and submit a report in a month.

236,['4/03/2020'],"Bhagoria festival: Documenting history, tradition to bust myths","INDORE: As the seven-day-long Bhagoria festival of tribal community started in four districts of Malwa region from Tuesday, Alirajpur district administration has planned to document history and practices of the fair, which is also known as Bhongrya or Bhangoria Haat.

The idea is to dispel various myths that surround the origin and purpose of this festival that has been celebrated in these tribal regions from centuries.

“With the help of historians and local community leaders, we have planned to document history and practice of the festival in our bid to solve ‘confusion’ related to its origin and purpose,” district collector Surbhi Gupta told TOI.

Some historians say that the festival was started around seven centuries back when a local king Bhangu Nayak organized an event to attract locals, who were migrating to nearby districts due to famine. Legend has it that at the same time, the area received good rainfall and people returned. The agriculture yield was also good and people made offerings at a local Shiva temple as mark of thanksgiving. This later became an annual custom, which over the years converted into a larger festival that was celebrated in Jhabua and nearby districts.

A few local leaders claim that actual name of the festival is Bhongrya, wherein, people of tribal community gather in a fair and make purchases ahead of Holi.

A common myth associated with the festival is that at some places, tribal youths propose to girls by applying ‘gulal’ on them and if the girls accept the proposal, then the ‘couple’ elopes from the spot.

Historians and local leaders, however, deny that such a practice exists. They say that meeting of youngsters in such big festival is common but such ‘customs’ that usually the ‘outsiders’ talk of, are only myths.

On Tuesday, festival was started in Pitol, Khardu and Thandala area of Jhabua and Bakhatgarh and Ambua area of Alirajpur district. Both district administrations have made extensive arrangements for those who throng the fair beside putting in place adequate security measure like installation of CCTVs and using drone-cameras for better crowd management..

“In Jhabua, we have made required arrangements for the fair, where people of Self-Help-Groups have been provided space to showcase and sell their products. Arrangements including that of drinking water, toilets, lights etc have also been made” Collector Prabal Sipaha said.

According to local administrative officials, liquor consumption usually goes up manifold during the festival and as such they were keeping a close watch on supply/sale of illicit liquor.

Ishan, who has low vision, will take the exam with the help of a writer. He is among the students who had approached the district education officer (DEO) to seek writers and special amenities.

Riddhesh Rawal, Ishan’s father, said that he is thankful to the administration for instilling confidence in Ishan. “He needs more light than other students and a magnifying lens to read the examination paper,” he said. “Ishan will solve the problems on the white board and the writer will note down the answers in the paper.”

Education department officials said that students like Ishan have the indomitable spirit and don’t want to waste a year. That spirit prompts them to take the exam with or without a writer. Mansi Vyas, a Class XII student, was involved in a road accident recently. Her right leg is in a cast. “I will be seated on the first floor at a school in Viramgam. I am confident of scoring good marks,” she said.

The right hand of Yuvraj Bihola, a Class XII student from Vehlal, was fractured after he fell. “I was initially unsure about the exam, but I decided not to waste a year and started preparations with my family’s help,” he said. “I will get a writer.”

COIMBATORE: A 30-year-old woman, who broke into her relative’s house near Sowdamman Kovil Lane at Town Hall in the city and decamped with 75 sovereigns gold ornaments, was arrested on Tuesday.

The Ukkadam (crime) police have recovered all the stolen ornaments from the accused, Chandini alias Mubina, 30, wife of Babu, of Madheena Nagar at Kovaipudur.

According to police, the gold ornaments were stolen from the house of Muneera Begum, of VG Complex near Sowdamman Kovil Lane at Town Hall.

On Monday morning, Muneera Begum locked her house and went to a hospital to take care of her mother-in-law after her husband, son and daughter-in-law had left for their work.

When she returned home around 6.30pm, she found the front door of the house was broken open and that gold ornaments, which were kept in an almirah, were missing.

Muneera Begum immediately informed the Ukkadam police, who registered a case under sections 380 and 454 of the Indian Penal Code.

Preliminary inquiry by Ukkadam police inspector Amudha revealed that Mubina is a relative of Muneera Begum. Mubina stole the ornaments as she was in dire need of Rs 2 lakh to repay her loan amount to some people.

“We checked the CCTV cameras in the area and found Mubina crossing the area with a small bag. Half an hour later, she was returning from the area with the bag fully packed. We picked her for interrogation on Tuesday and she confessed to the crime,” a police officer said.

240,['4/03/2020'],Madhya Pradesh: Farmers find 800-year-old idols while digging a pond in Chatarpur,"The idols may be about 800 year old and belong to 12th century AD.

BHOPAL: Centuries old Chandel-era stone idols were unearthed from a farm of Pura village, in Chatarpur district , last week.

In a belated move, the local administration finally swung into action and took the idols in its custody on Monday. Archeological Survey of India sources, requesting anonymity, claimed, “The idols may be about 800 year old and belong to 12th century AD; they have immense antiquity value.”

Avinash Rawat, sub divisional magistrate (SDM) Luvkush Nagar said, “We have taken idols in our possession and placed them under double-lock . We have also informed the ASI officials in Khajuraho; they are expected here tomorrow to inspect the site as well as the idols.”

The idols were discovered at the farm of Karan and Brajraj Singh in Pura village in the backward region of Bundelkhand , about 50 kms away from Khajuraho , the world heritage site famous for its temples. Till the administration took the possession of the idols, they were kept at Brajraj’s home. The local panchayat had recently sanctioned a pond on Singh’s land; and a day after the digging started, the idols were found. A small dilapidated temple with Khajuraho-like architecture is also located on the edge of the farm where the digging is being done, said a villager.

As soon as the two ancient idols were taken out, the villagers started reaching the spot and people started worshipping them. “ In the past too, people have found coins and some stones with carvings in the same area,” said the farmers and added, “ proper excavation work should be carried out at the spot under the supervision of the Archeological Survey of India.”

RAJKOT: A 30-year-old woman was stabbed and strangulated to death by her own brother and his two friends late on Monday night over a long-standing tiff over her refusal to return to her in-laws house.

The deceased was identified as Hetal Khachar. Due to some domestic squabbles, Hetal had returned to her parents house in Rajkot barely a year after her marriage to police constable Dilip in Botad around 11 years ago.

Hetal frequently quarrelled with her younger brother Yuvraj who was persuading her to go back and stay with her husband.

On Monday, Hetal had accompanied her mother Shantu Manjariya, sister (name not known) and her husband Bhagirath Khachar to Satadhar, a religious place near Junagadh in a car. As it got late, they decided to make a night halt at her maternal uncle’s house in Khijadiya village near Visavadar .

“When he reached Jetalvad village near Visavadar at around 9:30pm, Yuvraj and his two unidentified friends waylaid their car and dragged Hetal out. Yuvraj repeatedly stabbed while his two friends strangulated her with a rope. They escaped from there and Hetal later died at a government hospital in Visavadar,” said Pradeepsinj Jadeja, deputy superintendent of police, Junagadh.

Sources in the police department said that Hetal used to frequently leave her mother’s house without informing anyone.

A year ago, she had left the house and started living with her sister and brother-in-law Bhagirath in Paliyad near Botad.

“It was only 20 days ago that she had come back to Rajkot and started living with her mother,” said Jadeja. Due to her frequent disappearance from the house, people and other relatives had started taunting Yuvraj and asked him to do something about her. Yuvraj, who police said is extremely short-tempered, used to force her to leave, but Hetal remained adamant.

“We suspect that some close relative is also involved in the plot to murder her as Yuvraj had specific information about their travel plan. We have called for call detail records of some relatives,” Jadeja added. Yuvraj and two others have been booked following a complaint lodged by Hetal’s mother.

BHOPAL: Arera colony has been adversely affected by erratic water supply for the past two days. As summers approach, disruption in water supply is expected to increase. Ahead of the civic elections, water supply could turn into a huge political issue in the state capital, according observers.

Upper Lake, Kolar and Kerwa water supply aside, Narmada water supply and its unfilled project promises are expected to touch a chord with the residents of Bhopal.

“Forty per cent of the state capital is not yet directly connected with BMC water supply. The promise of bringing 24x7 Narmada water supply to the city is unfilled. Rs 1,200 crore spent on the project should be investigated,” said local Congress leader and former BMC corporator , Girish Sharma. Funding for the project was primarily through the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM). Rs 350 crore alone is spent on bringing Narmada water to the state capital.

“Original implementation plan of the scheme was tweaked to meet vested political interests. Originally, the scheme was to cover Govindpura, MP Nagar and surroundings areas. It was extended in parts. It now covers Narela, part of Arera Colony, TT Nagar, Char Imli and other areas not under the original project design,” he added. “In effect, the proclamation of 24x7 water supply, whereby each of the overhead water tanks were to be filled five times in 24-hours, has not been met. Water supply to Narmada connected tanks is seldom on daily basis. Gravity-based pumping from Shyamla Hills pumping station to fill overhead water tanks has failed,” alleged Sharma.

Former Bhopal mayor and local BJP leader Alok Sharma contradicts these allegations. “An efficient water system is in place. The most important aspect is to being about distribution efficiency. Supervisory control and data acquisition ( SCADA ) was proposed to be implemented. It will bring water to all in the state capital,” he said.

SCADA requires an investment of Rs 450 crore. The only place where it has been implemented in part is the Idgah Hills water supply plant. The plant only gets water from Upper Lake . Much of new Bhopal is reliant on other water sources like borewells.

Many of our members have informed that they have stopped accepting bulk orders of masks to ensure supply for common people,” said Rajendra Kawadkar, president of Nagpur District Chemist and Druggists Association.According to him, hand sanitizers, medicated hand wash liquids are also in demand. “Demand of nutrition products to strengthen immunity is also on the high in the last two weeks,” he added.With a common notion that people with good immunity have less chances to get affected with this virus, citizens are asking for immunity booster Ayurvedic tonics, tablets and naturopathy medicines from specialists.Ambarish Ghatate, grower of Ayurvedic herbs and supplier of medicines, said that demand of several medicines used as immunity boosters has seen a multifold rise in the last one month.“Shatavari Kalp, Balapushti powder and almond powder are highly in demand. People believe that this will boost their immunity and they will be fit enough to deal with any viral infection,” said Ghatate.Ayurveda practitioner Vaidya Balkrishna Suryawanshi said that more people are opting for Panchakarma this season. “We conduct Vaman — which is one of the five processes of Panchakarma during the present season. This ensures that toxins get ejected from the body and it gets enough power to face airborne infections for rest of the season,” he said adding that his Panchakarma centre has more than double registrations for ‘Vaman’ in comparison with last year.As allopathy is yet to invent vaccine on Covid-19, people are checking out alternative schools of medicines for remedy. “Many patients are asking Homeopathy practitioners if they have medicine on Coronavirus infections.

248,['4/03/2020'],"Govt to limit BC quota in local body polls to 50%, ensure elections do not clash with exams","Amaravati: Panchayat Raj minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy on Tuesday said the government will finalise reservations for local body elections in a couple of days.

Speaking to the media in the secretariat on Tuesday, the minister said that they would take enough care to avoid that public examinations and elections to local bodies would not clash.

He said that the government had readied the entire process by increasing reservation for backward class communities in the local bodies.

“We have decided to follow the high court directive and go to the elections with a cap on the total reservations at 50 percent,” said Peddireddy.

He said that they have directed district collectors to rework the quota and send fresh proposals. He said that they would send the proposals to the State Commission (SEC) soon after finalization of the reservations.

The minister, however, lashed out at TDP president Chandrababu Naidu for conspiring against the government’s move to increase the BC reservations. He said that Naidu was behind the petitioner Pratap Reddy who filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court against the increased quota for the BCs in the state.

He said that the issue reached the HC following the SC directive and finally the high court struck down their move. “Naidu should admit that Pratap Reddy is his party leader and tender an apology to the backward class communities. Naidu could not digest the growing clout of the BCs, the SCs, the STs and minorities under the leadership of Jaganmohan Reddy,” said Peddireddy.

He said that Jaganmohan Reddy was the first chief minister in the country to provide 50 percent reservations to the SC, ST, BCs and minorities and also to women in all the nominated boards, trusts and market committees. He said that the BCs should teach Naidu a lesson in the coming elections as he had conspired against the increased quota.

He said that Naidu was speaking about his love for the BCs while sabotaging the additional quota. He said that the state government would have implemented the 59 percent quota for all the reserved categories had the TDP leader not filed the petition in the court.

249,['4/03/2020'],Championing the cause of organ donation,"In a country where organ donation numbers are still significantly low, Dakoori Bhagavan Reddy reminds us how a simple gesture can save lives. Meet the 36-year-old whose journey – on this path to help poor kidney patients – started after life dealt him two blows. The first at the age of 19 when he lost his sister to kidney failure and the second in 2006 when he developed a kidney disease, owing to a genetic problem.

“I lost my sister because there weren’t any donors available. Later, when I too was diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease, for five years I was put on lifetime medication and the expensive drugs took a toll on me. Then in 2012, one of my aunts donated her kidney to me. That’s when I realised I have to promote organ donation and transplantation,” says the founder of Cheyutha Foundation for Organ Transplants , that operates across Telangana and AP.

From organising campaigns and free screening camps to donating medicines, visiting slums, busting myths around organ donation and transplantation, and even providing jobs, Reddy’s foundation has impacted over 200 people since it was started in 2015.

Formed with the help of four renal transplant patients, the group now has over 750 members. The foundation was also instrumental in getting the AP government to provide Rs 5,000 pension to transplant recipients in February this year.

But Reddy’s plans do not stop at this. He is working on providing night shelters to those who come to the city from districts for treatment. “The treatment is done only in Hyderabad. So, at times I provide accommodation to patients at my home. I am looking for sponsors to create shelters,” he says.

Reddy’s efforts have touched many. Among them is Mohammed Iftekharuddin, an electrical draftsman, who said, “I was on dialysis for six years. From dialysis to post-transplantation there was no source of income for my family as I had lost my job in Sharjah. I spent more than I earned on my treatment. Bhagavan helped me get a job at Reliance Digital. I am now a beneficiary under ESI, which covers the cost of my medicines,” he said.

BHOPAL: A sex racket allegedly being run from a clinic in Barkhedi was busted and 10 people arrested on Tuesday.

Police said, 52-year-old Gayatri Singh is allegedly as the kingpin of the racket. She is a doctor having a Bachelor of Unani Medicine and Surgery (BUMS) degree.

DSP (crime branch) Aditi Bhawsar said, the accused is not a registered medical practitioner, “Singh not only operated the racket, but is also allegedly a sex worker. The racket was being operated in a busy area for the last two years, without police having any clue about it.”

“The ‘clinic’ was open from afternoon till night every day. The ‘popularity’ of the racket can be understood from the fact that during the raid many men knocked on the ‘clinic’ door for their visit. The cell phone of the woman kept ringing continuously after it was seized by the cops,” said the DSP. The DSP said, DGP VK Singh had recently received an anonymous complaint from Barkheda residents about a sex racket being operated from a clinic. The complaint was forwarded to the crime branch. Since then, a team has been tracking the activities at the clinic. Once confirmed that suspicious activities were taking place, a woman constable was sent to the clinic to verify the allegations.

The constable met the doctor posing as a woman in urgent need of a job. The doctor agreed to employ the constable as a sex worker and she alerted the team, after which a raid was conducted, said police.

Four women and six men were arrested from the clinic.

The main accused is a resident of Ashoka Garden. “Singh told police that her husband too was a doctor and it was he who had rented the clinic in 1996. He died in 2000 and since then she has been running the clinic. The woman confessed to operating the sex racket for the last two years.”

INDORE: The state arm of Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) aims to sell about 50,000 bales of cotton in Madhya Pradesh procured in the year 2018/19 but higher prices offered by government agency may play a deterrent in luring industry players.

To attract buyers, CCI has come up with volume based bulk discount from Monday for selling cotton procured in 2018/19 but industry players claimed government offer is still over Rs 3,000 per candy costlier than current market rate. An official from CCI said, “The pace of sale for old stock was slow because of price difference but we hope that bulk discount will help in clearing the old stocks. Around 50,000 bales cotton from a year ago will be put on sale.” CCI procures cotton from farmers when prices slip from the government fixed minimum support prices (MSP) to safeguard farmers’ interest. In the new season 2019/20, CCI has procured around 2.85 lakh bales of cotton in state and is expected to continue procurement in coming months as well. In Nimar region, several ginning units using cotton as raw material had to shut shops or cut production after prolonged rains pushed back fresh harvest and hit quality. Industry was pinning hope on supplies from CCI at competitive rates to run operations.

Kailash Agrawal, former president, Madhya Pradesh Association of Cotton Processors and Traders said, “Even after bulk discount, prices offered by CCI is over Rs 3,000 per candy higher than current market rates. It's better to buy from spot market when available than to buy expensive cotton from CCI.”

CCI is selling at Rs 42,000 per candy after offering discount of Rs Rs 4,000 per candy which according to traders is still higher than current spot price of Rs 38,500 to 39,500 per candy. Mohan Singh, a ginner said, “There is no point in purchasing so expensive cotton from old stocks. Quality of stocked old cotton deteriorates with time making it unsuitable for every process.”

Candidates with degrees Jin biotechnology were rejected by the authorities, holding them ineligible.

Allowing the candidature of applicants with BSc and MSc degrees in biotechnology, Justice Biren Vaishnav accepted the contention of the candidates that “biology is the basic science whereas biotechnology is a much more advanced stage of biology”. The court also agreed with the argument that no university in Gujarat awards degree called BSc (Biology) or MSc (Biology).

The HC also further said that it is in agreement with the submission that biotechnology is a branch of science in which biological, physical and chemical – tools and techniques are used/devised to reduce time, cost, risk involved in the production or maintenance of a process. In simple terms, biology is a science while biotechnology is a branch of biology. It is an industry. While biology involves the study of living organisms, biotechnology involves the use of biology for the benefit of mankind.

With these observations, the HC ordered the state authorities to issue appointment orders to the petitioners because they had all required eligibility criteria including clearing the Teachers Aptitude Test (TAT).

Recruitment for sikshan sahayak posts began in 2017. The state education board accepted online applications of candidates with graduate or postgraduate degrees in maths/physics/chemistry/biology/botany or zoology only.

The petitioners were led by Singanallur constituency DMK MLA N Karthik, senior leader Pongalur N Palanisamy, Congress leader Mayura Jayakumar, MDMK’s Nandagopal, CPM’s Padmanaban, former CPI MLA Arumugam, VCK leader Ilakkiyan and TPDK general secretary Ku Ramakrishnan.

Karthik said that police used to deny permission to conduct protest at Gandhipuram even for highlighting civic issues. “But BJP, Hindu Munnani and other outfits staged a pro-CAA dharna at Gandhipuram. If police fail to stop it, DMK and alliance parties would stage a protest,” he said.

The group petitioned collector K Rajamani in the evening with the same demand. “Muslims have been conducting protests against CAA for more than 10 days. So, Hindu outfit members have launched a protest against Muslims at Gandhipuram,” Karthik said.

Hindu Munnani had launched an indefinite pro-CAA event near Hotel Tamil Nadu on Dr Nanjappa Road on Monday evening.

The villagers have urged the district administration and village panchayat authorities to find out the actual cause behind their death and address the same.

K Asaithambi, a villager, said they were shocked to find dead fishes floating in the lake. “We immediately alerted the officials to clear them from the lake.”

Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) officials have collected samples of dead fishes and lake water for lab test. “We could tell anything only after scrutinizing the lab report,” a TNPCB official said.

Pointing out that the lake water might have been getting heated in the scorching sun, he said it was impossible for tiny fishes to withstand the heat. “Hot water could have caused their death.”

According to the villagers, the man-made lake, which is spread across nearly two acres, was set up around six decades ago for irrigation purposes.

They said the lake was desilted in December last year under the ‘Kudimaramathu’ scheme. “After desilting the lake, we had filled it with Thenpennaiyar river water and released tiny fishes in it,” another villager said.

The high court has adjourned the case to March 16.

The APPSC had issued a notification in December 2018 to fill up posts for group-I services. The preliminary examination was held on May 26, 2019. The group-I mains examination was to have been held from June 10, 2019 but got deferred. Petitions were filed in the high court pleading that the court stay the release of the results as there were errors in the Telugu translation of question papers and refusal to allow calculators. The results of the preliminary examination were declared in November, the commission announced a schedule for the mains examination in December but this was deferred to February 2020.

On January 28, the high court stayed the conduct of the mains and asked the government to explore the possibility of conducting the examination again.

The delay in the conduct of the mains examination has caused uncertainty among candidates who are unsure whether to focus on the group-I mains or switch over to the Union Public Service Commission’s ( UPSC ) civil services preliminary examination, slated for May 31. The two examinations have different syllabi, leaving candidates with little time to focus on both.

The APPSC had decided to conduct the group-I mains examination between April 7-19, however, three more petitions were filed in the high court, seeking cancellation of the mains examination.

“This whole issue of cases and postponement of exam schedule has demotivated all the candidates who have got selected for mains exam. We don’t know if the examination will be held at all,” said V Prasanthi, a candidate, adding that many candidates working with private firms had applied for long leaves to prepare for the mains examination. They cancelled their leaves and went back to work after the delay in conduct of the mains examination, she said.

Shaik Fatima, another candidate, said, “The issue will not be resolved unless the chief minister directly reviews the situation and takes a call. APPSC should ready a plan-B to provide relief to the candidates who have already lost their mental peace and precious time in preparation.”

PSR Anjaneyulu, additional DGP and in-charge secretary, APPSC said, “We have no plans either to cancel or postpone the group-I mains. We will go ahead with the schedule if high court allows us. We are waiting for the judgement on the issue.”

The 24-year-old had travelled from Dubai to Bengaluru on February 20 and later came to Hyderabad. His samples had tested positive on Monday.While 45 of his contacts were taken to the state-run Gandhi Hospital since Monday night, the remaining who were not symptomatic have been kept in isolation at their homes. The results for the 36 symptomatic patients are expected on Wednesday, said health authorities. “The 36 include his co-passengers in the bus that he took from Bengaluru to Hyderabad and family members,” said Vijay Kumar, state nodal officer for coronavirus detection.Sources, however, added that showing symptoms doesn’t necessarily mean that they have been infected and their samples may still test negative for the virus.The Telangana government, for its part, has allocated Rs 100 crore for preventing and containing a possible outbreak. The fund will be used for extensive awareness activities. Besides, private hospitals have been given a directive not to delay reporting cases when they have symptoms of the virus.State health minister Eatala Rajender has sought 50,000 additional masks from the Centre given the shortage in Hyderabad. He has also sought help to enhance testing capacity in the state.

The only positive case is with a travel history of Dubai, but all precautionary measures have been put in place. We are constantly in touch with the Centre over preparatory measures to be taken. A 15-member team will visit Kerala on Wednesday to study the measures taken there,” said Rajender.The health department will run awareness campaigns and put up hoardings, notice boards at parks, bus stands, flights, rail, cinema halls, schools and hospitals. In addition to three designated hospitals for isolating patients, military hospital, TB sanitorium Vikarabad and all teaching hospitals around Hyderabad have been asked to prepare isolation wards.

PUNE: Cybercrooks , in separate instances, duped two women collectively to the tune of over Rs2 lakh.

The Yerawada and Vishrantwadi police registered two FIRs under the Indian Penal Code and the Information Technology Act on Monday.

In the first instance that occurred earlier this month, a 70-year-old woman from Yerawada lost Rs1 lakh after a fraudster convinced her to download a remote-access app on the pretext of updating her Unified Payments Interface (UPI) application.

In the FIR, the woman said she received a text message on February 2, which claimed that her UPI app would expire. Another text directed her to contact a person. The woman called up that person, who said he would get in touch with her the next day. The following day, he contacted her, told her to download a remote-access app and managed to extract details of her debit card from her, police said.

Over the next few days, the man repeatedly called the woman and asked her to check the app on multiple instances to see if her KYC details were updated. This way, he was able to obtain sensitive information from the phone, police said.

Between February 4 and 7, the woman received four alerts, each informing her that Rs25,000 was debited from her bank account.

Police said an inquiry conducted by the bank revealed that the money was transferred into two e-wallets in Gurugram and Mumbai. The woman later filed a complaint plea with the bank and filled a distress form claiming a refund.

In the second incident, a 22-year-old woman engineer from Vishrantwadi purchased clothes on an e-commerce website in October 2019. When she received the parcel, she was dissatisfied with the dress and sent an email to the website seeking an exchange.

Police said a delivery boy visited her house to pick up the dress, but she was not at home. Later, a man called her, telling her that he would send her a link to initiate the exchange process. He asked her to forward the link to a mobile number.

After the woman forwarded the link, Rs1,05,000 was debited from her bank account over multiple transactions between October and December.

“We are conducting technical investigations and taking help from cybercrime experts to solve these two cases at the earliest,” a police officer said.

Having secured bail, he now awaits a local court’s verdict which would decide his fate. Even pleas to Indian embassy in Nigeria hasn’t yielded any relief for the the 25-year-old sailor from Vizianagaram in AP.

It is the responsibility of the shipping company to fight our legal battle,” Rao told TOI from Nigeria. The ship belongs to US-based Petronav Carriers.

The sailor’s fate hit choppy seas on April 19 last year when Somalian pirates hijacked MT Apecus off the coast of Bonny island. The pirates took five Indians captive, including two from AP, but Rao escaped detection by hiding in the engine room. The abducted five saw freedom on June 27 from Pirates’ custody after the intervention of Indian government which had sounded out Nigerian authorities.

He along with other foreign sailors on board were arrested by Nigerian navy on the charge of ship entering their waters illegally. Having spent six months in jail, the sailors got bail but were ordered to stay on board the ship at Bonny island till the final verdict — likely to be out on March 24.

“I thought I had saved myself from the pirates, but I have gotten into a bigger problem now,” said Rao, who used to do odd jobs before turning a sailor.

Divya, a close relative of Rao in Vizianagaram, said she too had spoken to the Indian embassy in Nigeria three months ago but did not get any assurance. “We want the government to intervene and help him return home,” Divya said.

“As many as 1,800 families have been residing along the lake for decades. TNSCB had provided alternative accommodation to all of them in the housing units at Malumichampatti and Kovaipudur. But the encroachers are refusing to shift and are using both the houses,” said a TNSCB official. “We held talks with them to convince them to vacate the houses, which are constructed in violation of the norms. The move is still in preliminary stage. We will demolish the houses only after convincing the people to vacate on their own. We want to ensure that they don’t create any law and order problem.”

Meanwhile, the encroachers are refusing to move to the TNSCB units and are demanding an alternative land. “Most of us work as labourers within the city limits. If shifted to the city outskirts, we would be forced to spend half of our wage on transportation. The housing units lack even the basic amenities like water and power. Also, we will be forced to send our children to the schools that are kilometres away from the housing units,” said M Manikandan. “We had conveyed our demands to the officials during the last meeting conducted a few months ago. The officials had agreed to consider our demands,” he added.

The corporation had issued work order to commence the lake project a few months ago and is carrying out the preliminary works.

273,['4/03/2020'],Gujarat: Onion prices expected to rise as Union government lifts export ban,"Picture used for representational purpose only

RAJKOT: Onion prices are likely to upset budgets of families again.

After embargo on exports imposed last year in wake of skyrocketing prices, the Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) has allowed the free export of all varieties of onion from India beginning March 15. The notification issued by the DGFT on March 2 comes following representations from various marketing yards and farmer bodies including Mahuva marketing yard to the union minister of agriculture last month.

Traders believe that the onion prices in local markets are likely to increase as a result of export and the crop arrival this year has already been delayed by two months due to prolonged inclement weather last year.

In Bhavnagar and Mahuva yard, onion selling at Rs 250 to Rs 300 per 20 kg shot up Rs 470 two days before the news came in that government was likely to allow the export.

Narendra Gohil, an onion trader in Bhavnagar yard said, “When exports start, we are expect rise in price. At present, onions from Nashik market are pouring in domestic market. One exports begin, the demand for the Mahuva quality onion will increase in domestic market.”

The government of India had banned onion export on September 29 last year after the prices crossed Rs 150 per kg in retail market. Amreli and Bhavnagar are the two biggest onion producing districts in Gujarat.

The normal season for the onion production is January and February, but this year the harvest has been delayed due to prolonged monsoon.

According to agriculture department data, the onion sowing area increased to 39,000 hecatre in Gujarat in current financial year from 25,000 ha last year. However the yield is likely to decrease by 30% this year. “The onion flood yards during the peak season, but this year we don’t expect much yield because of some disease also,” Gohil added.

Currently, 15,000 bags (each containing 50kg) are coming for auction in Bhavnagar and Mahuva yards. Every year during peak season, 1.50 lakh bags are brought for auction. This year, traders expect around 60,000 to 75,000 bags daily.

Vitthal Koradia, an onion exporter said, “Generally, the onion crop comes in winter, but this year when the peak season arrives in April, the temperature will be high, which will damage the crop.”

Ghanshyam Patel, secretary, Mahuva marketing yard said, “On February 5, we had represented to the union agriculture minister to allow export.”

Making the announcement while addressing the media here on Tuesday, Gandhi said they would encourage tribal youths in different sports and games and pick the talented boys and girls from the Visakha agency area for further training so that they can compete at the national level.

Moreover, the association will also focus on the budding sportspersons’ diet, mental as well as physical well-being.

The announcement comes in the wake of a few youths forming the Indian Tribal Sports Association a few months ago, whose honorary president is BJP MLC PVN Madhav. The association was established to provide better opportunities to tribal youths in the field of sports.

So far, 800 boys and girls have registered themselves at the association. They would be divided on the basis of the sports they are interested in, clubs would be established and then competitions would be conducted division wise.

Gandhi further said that in their endeavour, they would take the suggestions and advice from the district and state level sports associations.

BHOPAL: Government officials in Madhya Pradesh would have to respect armed forces personnel. If anyone from the armed forces visits any government office for work, it would be done on priority. Normally, such orders are issued verbally at the local district-level in respect for armed forces, but the MP government has made it official for the entire state this time.

The general administration department issued orders in this regard to all department heads, divisional commissioners, collectors, chief executive officers and to all departments of MP, stating that personnel of armed forces must be treated well in government offices.

Orders issued by Dharnendra Kumar Jain, deputy secretary, GAD, stated that defence forces like the army, air force, navy, central forces like Border Security Force , Indo Tibetan Border Police , Central Reserve Police Force work in “adverse working conditions, risking their lives to serve and secure the country”.

“Thousands of kilometers away from their homes, the armed forces personnel work for the country in risky areas in bad weather round-the-clock,” it stated.

“The personnel from armed forces visit their home for a limited period in a year and have to finish all pending works in their home during the brief visit.

“Among these pending works, a lot of them are also related to government departments at different levels and different government offices,” the state government order went on to state.

“It has been decided by the government that jawans and retired officials from armed forces, central armed forces and their family members visiting the government offices for any work must be treated with affection and respect and the work for which they came to office must be done soon. Kindly ensure that orders are followed strictly,” the orders said.

Officials said there are committees and nodal officers at the district and state level to look into issues of defence forces, but the orders in question is for the ease of personnel of armed forces visiting any government office for their personal work. Making it in black and white could also attract action against any government employee or official disregarding the orders.

The parents who approached the DEO officials with the support of Vadodara Parents’ Association claimed that since the last four days, they have been seeking permission from the office.

Five students, who had suffered injuries recently, were waiting for permission from the office. On Tuesday, only three students were granted permission.

“My daughter’s son had got his hand fractured after meeting an accident at Tarsali. When we approached the school, we were told that he will require permission from the DEO for seeking assistance from a writer,” said Bhailal Makwana, a retired employee of Indian Railways.

“We had also submitted a certificate from the doctor but we are being asked to change it as the doctor has not clearly mentioned that the student requires such an assistance,” he said.

Officials of DEO said they have been personally assisting such students and their parents.

“As per rules, we require a clear opinion from the civil surgeon of government hospital as certificate of private practitioner is not allowed. We have personally spoken to doctors and are assisting the parents,” said an official.

278,['4/03/2020'],"Madhya Pradesh: No threat to Kamal Nath govt, says Rambai’s husband","BHOPAL: In the eye of a storm, BSP MLA Rambai is incommunicado for the past two days. All her known mobile phones are in switch-off mode, but her husband Govind Singh denied that there is any horse-trading or threat to the government.

Rambai, the legislator from Patharia in Damoh district, is one of two BSP MLAs supporting the Congress government. On Tuesday, senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh set off a political storm by tweeting that former BJP minister Bhupendra Singh had taken Rambai to Delhi by chartered flight. When reporters couldn’t get through to her, the controversy deepened.

Her husband tried to clear the air later in the day, denying that there was any horse-trading on. “I have spoken with her and asked her about the rumours. I told her to return to Bhopal tomorrow. She will be back in Damoh by evening,” he told reporters in Damoh in the evening. “These are rumours. There is no threat to the government,” he added. In the morning, however, Singh had said that she had gone to Bhopal.

Singh said their daughter is ailing and Rambai has flown to Delhi for her treatment. “And if Bhupendra Singh was also on the same flight, anyone can spread any rumour,” he argued, pointing out that Digvijaya has said he has full confidence in her.

Talking to TOI on Tuesday afternoon, state BSP president Ramakant Pippal said, “I don’t know her (Rambai’s) whereabouts. When our leader, behen Mayawati ji asks me, I will try to contact her.”

This is not the first time that Rambai is involved in controversy. Soon after she was elected, she alleged that BJP has approached her and offered Rs 50 crore and a minister’s post. Praising chief minister Kamal Nath, who she refers to “Dada”, she said she had full faith in him. “I am with Kamal Nath dada and not with Congress,” she had said.

Rambai has often expressed resentment over the “neglect” of MLAs supporting the government, but has expressed her support to CM Nath.

Last year, she again sparked controversy when she supported CAA and praised PM Narendra Modi , home minister Amit Shah and Union minister and Damoh MP Prahalad Patel for enacting the law. Soon after this, BSP supremo Mayawati suspended her, and Rambai “withdrew” her statement almost immediately.

279,['4/03/2020'],"Many in BJD vie for RS seats, Naveen may spring a surprise","Bhubaneswar: Intense lobbying is on in the ruling BJD for the four Rajya Sabha seats, for which election is scheduled to be held on March 26.

Formal notification for the polls would come up on Friday to fill up the seats to be vacated by Anubhav Mohanty, Narendra Swain, Sarojini Hembram of BJD and Ranjib Biswal of Congress.

What makes the race more interesting is that the tenure of all the four seats is full six years.

Many senior leaders, especially those who faced defeat in the last year’s simultaneous elections or denied party tickets, are making all-out efforts for an Upper House berth.

Some of the eminent personalities from the legal profession and entertainment industry are also trying to push their names through various channels, a BJD insider said.

Even as guessing game is on about the probable names, a reliable BJD source said party president and chief minister Naveen Patnaik may spring a big surprise when he announces names of candidates.

Naveen has already started consultations to zero in on the names. “Formal announcement is expected a day before or after the Holi,” said a senior BJD functionary, requesting anonymity.

Rajya Sabha arithmetic says the BJD will easily grab three seats going by its strength in the state assembly while no other party has absolute numbers for the fourth seat.

Each candidate needs support of at least 30 MLAs to win one Rajya Sabha seat (if all the 147 MLAs participate in the voting), said an official source.

Though BJD had left one seat for BJP’s Ashwini Vaishnaw despite having numbers in June last year, a senior BJD leaders said they would fight all four seats this time and manage to garner the numbers.

A member of the Balangir royal family (either AU Singh Deo or his son and former MP Kalikesh Singh Deo) is likely to be nominated to the Rajya Sabha. Among others, names like Pushpendra Singh Deo, Rabindra Jena, Debashish Samantray, Maheswar Mohanty, Prasanna Patasani and Ramesh Chandra Chyau Patnaik are doing the rounds.

Besides BJD leaders, the BJD boss may choose senior lawyer Ashok Parija, filmmaker Nila Madhab Panda and a former head of a central PSU.

A woman from the backward classes may also get a surprise entry into the BJD list going by the recent focus of the party on backward classes, comprising around 54% of state’s population.

A section of leaders also guessed that Hembram, who is a tribal and a woman, may get re-nomination to ensure representation from tribal communities.

The Election Commission of India has appointed assembly secretary Dasarathi Satpathy as returning officer-cum-presiding officer for the election.

A Canadian delegation led by Cyril Borle, consul and trade commissioner, Consulate-General of Canada, Debjani Pal of Study in Canada, Carolyn Glover of the Immigration Refugees and Citizenship, Canada (IRCC) under the Government of Canada and S Arvind, Air Canada, amongst others, emphasised Canada’s eagerness to partner with Indian cities that are growing as business and education hubs.

Cyril Borle said, “Visakhapatnam is the largest city in AP and the ninth-richest city in India. Visakhapatnam is also a port city which renders it favourable for driving businesses from across the country and around the world.”

Borle added, “Fishing and various heavy industries have flourished in the city as a result.

He said that they will file the petition along with BC organisations and continue the fight to uphold the rights of the backward classes.

Speaking to reporters here on Tuesday, Naidu found fault with the state government’s decision to follow the HC verdict without approaching the apex court.

”The government’s decision clearly shows that they are not in favour of increased quota for the BCs. They have requested the HC to give any verdict instead of pressing hard for the increased reservations,” Naidu said.

He asked why the state government was not filing a Special Leave Petition in the Supreme Court like the Kirankumar Reddy government had done to give rightful quota to the BCs in 2013 elections.

“Regardless of the present government’s indifference, TDP will approach the apex court along with BC associations to protect their reservations in local body polls,” said Naidu.

Naidu said that chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy would go down in history as a betrayer of the BCs if his government did not appeal against the High Court order. He said that state government first gave an order for 59.85 per cent quota and encouraged its activists to file cases in the high court.

COIMBATORE: A 28-year-old drunk man went on a stoning spree in the early hours of Monday, killing an elderly woman and injuring two others at Eripalayam near Udumalpet in Tirupur. Police arrested and lodged him in the Coimbatore Central Prison on Tuesday.

According to an investigation officer, the incident took place when Arokyaraj, a daily wage labour from Udumalpet, was returning home after consuming liquor around 1.40am on Monday.

“He found R Jayalakshmi, 27, sleeping along with her family members outside her house at Lakshmi Nagar. He threw a stone at her and fled. The stone hit her on head. Hearing her scream, her family members and neighbours woke up and rushed her to the government hospital in Udumalpet,” the official said. He said Jayalakshmi’s condition was stable.

Arokyaraj, the officer said, then went to Cheran Nagar. “When he noticed 70-year-old Jothi Lakshmi sleeping outside her house, he picked up a stone and smashed her head, killing her on the spot. He then threw another stone into the house through window and that hit Lakshmi’s daughter-in-law Kalavani on her head,” the officer said.

As Kalavani cried for help, neighbours rushed to the spot and found Jothi Lakshmi lay dead in a pool of blood. They alerted the Udumalpet police, who send the body to the government hospital for postmortem. They also took Kalavani to the same hospital for treatment.

The Udumalpet police registered a case under Section 302 (murder) and arrested Arokyaraj on Tuesday. “While it appears like a murder without any motive, the truth will be revealed only after detailed inquiry, the officer said.

From re-laying road to constructing drainage and laying drinking water pipes in the town panchayat, all the civic works are moving at a snail’s pace.

Moreover, the entire area is covered with sand dust due to these works. It is a nightmare for motorists to pass through the area.

“The works have been going on for the last seven months,” K P Balachandran, a motorist, told TOI. “We have to cover our faces with masks while passing through Kesavan Nagar. Otherwise, we will develop breathing problems due to dust.”

The Kannankurichi town panchayat has been carrying out all the works at a cost of Rs 2 crore.

Executive officer of the town panchayat Arumuga Nainar said Kesavan Nagar was the biggest area in Kannankurichi. “We are speeding up the works and they will be completed soon.”

Kesavan Nagar has a population of more than 3,000 families.

It’s a challenging task to construct drainages and lay water pipelines without affecting the resident, he said.

Residents said the dug-up areas were not being filled properly. “They simply close the pit with sand. Due to dust, we can’t even see the vehicles coming in from the opposite direction,” a motorist said.

“The dust also enters our houses. We get breathing problems because of this,” A Usharani, a resident of Kesavan Nagar said.

The second phase of trials, which was funded by the National Institutes of Health, US, had found that rheumatoid arthritis patients who only used ayurveda medicines had lesser side effects or adverse effects. The third phase will replicate the pilot study among a larger population.

AVP Research Foundation chairman Dr P R Krishnakumar had signed a memorandum of understanding on February 20 with Dr Shasidhar Doddamani of the Central Council for Research in ayurveda (CCRAS) to conduct the first ever multicentric phase III clinical trial. CCRAS has allotted Rs 2.7 crore for it.

The trial will take place at three locations AVP Hospital in Coimbatore, the Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Metabolic Disorders in Bengaluru and the Raja Ramdeo Anandilal Central ayurveda Research Institute for Cancer in Mumbai. Researchers will separate patients into two groups. One will be given ayurveda medicines and allopathic placebo and the other, allopathic medicines, methotrexate and ayurveda placebo.

This is slightly different from the pilot study, which had 43 patients. “The pilot study had a third group, which was given a combination of both,” said Dr Sujit Eranezhath of AVP’s research team.

“This study demonstrates that double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies are possible when testing individualized classic ayurvedic versus allopathic treatment in ways acceptable to the western standards and to ayurvedic physicians,” said Dr Krishnakumar.

Dr K G Raveendran will be the treating physician for the study and Dr Somit Kumar will be the co-investigator.

The study has been designed by the director of clinical research at the Arthritis Association of South California , Dr Daniel Furst. “This phase of clinical trial will initially start with 360 participants. The reason we recruit more patients is that many usually drop out mid-study. So, our target is to have 80 patients in each of the three centres,” said Dr Eranezhath. The study will go on for 36 weeks.

The pilot study done by AVP in 2003 was published in 2011. Dr Krishnakumar said that this is one of the major initiatives of the government to position India’s medical wealth for the benefit of the world.

AVP Group has also initiated a clinical trial on the efficacy of ayurveda in management of diabetes. The study will be executed in Latvia in collaboration with the University of Latvia. It will be the first ever study to find the effectiveness of ayurveda in the management of diabetes population outside India.

For the past six months, she’s been an integral part of Kempegowda International Airport ’s Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) squad, a department that was earlier considered a male stronghold.Suma is among the 14 women firefighters that Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL), operator of KIA , inducted on February 19, 2018. With this, it became the first airport in the country to have a 14-member female firefighting team. The airport currently has a total of 265 firefighters.“Now, I’m a role model for all the girls in my locality. They have more confidence about foraying into jobs and sectors that are considered male-dominated,” said Suma.One year after their four-month training at Airports Authority of India’s Fire Service Training Centre in Kolkata and induction into the ARFF squad at Bengaluru airport, the women firefighters demonstrated their emergency rescue service process in a mock fire drill conducted at the airport premises on Tuesday.“The training was very difficult initially and there was a point where I was almost about to quit. However, I stayed and now I’m extremely proud. I have to stand under the scorching sun for several hours in a day but I’m about the work I’m doing,” said Suma, who is now part of the ARFF team looking after both the north and new south parallel runway (NSPR).The Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting squad is a specialised team involved in response, hazard mitigation, evacuation and rescue of passengers and crew during an emergency. They respond to aviation emergencies that occur within 8km of the airport boundary.“Initially, when I told my family and neighbours about the nature of my work, they were appalled and a bit wary since not many women become firefighters. They then understood that it’s a unique field and encouraged me,” said Priyadarshini B from Kalaburagi.Airport ARFF teams now have a response time of two to three minutes — two minutes to reach the edge of the runway and three to reach any other point of aircraft movement.Selvaraj Arumugam, head of ARFF at KIA, said: “With the recruitment of these 14 firefighters, our ARFF team’s staffing requirements have been met. However, we are open to getting more women on board in future, based on the need.”“What is heartening is that all the women displayed immense resolve during the rigorous training to emerge as proficient firefighters. Their passion for work, excellence and their trailblazing demeanour will inspire many. Their success is now spurring a legion of determined girls,” said Thomas Hoff Andersson, chief operating officer, BIAL.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74467331,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-605047,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/kias-fiery-women-brigade-displays-firefighting-prowess/articleshow/74465084.cms

HYDERABAD: Claiming that they forgot to remit the examination fee of 48 students, Sri Medha V Junior College, Kothapet approached the Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education ( TSBIE ) on Tuesday and requested them to issue hall tickets for exams, which are scheduled to begin on Wednesday.

Keeping the future of students in mind, the state decided to issue students hall tickets and to file a criminal complaint against the college management. Of these 48 students, 11 of them are Inter first-year students and remaining are in second year of Intermediate.

“Considering the interest of the academic career of the students, the government permitted to issue hall tickets to these students and ordered for taking stringent action against the management for the above lapse, including filing a criminal complaint against the college management,” said Syed Omer Jaleel, commissioner and secretary of TSBIE.

All these students belong to CEC group. Jaleel said the management has conducted ethics and environmental exams, which are compulsory for issuance of Inter certificate, even without board’s knowledge. Jaleel said that a day before the examination, the board noticed two cases — Sri Medha V Junior College and BR Ambedkar Vocational Junior College, where the managements were playing with the career of students.

The board said that a day before the examination, BR Ambedkar Vocational Junior College approached them and requested to issue hall tickets to nearly 30 students, who are studying in their college in Intermediate (vocational) first and second year.

“BR Ambedkar Vocational Junior College has neither applied for affiliation nor has any permission from the Board to run the college,” said Jaleel. Vocational students have to appear for practical exams, which were conducted until February 20, he said.

“Apart from practical examinations, these students have also not appeared for ethics & environmental exams, which are compulsory. Without practical exams and environmental & ethics exams, these students cannot be legally declared to be passed (even if the Board permits them to write theory exams now),” he said. “This is a farce being reenacted by the Ambedkar Vocational College this year just like they did last year,” Jaleel said. He said considering the legal position and in interest of the students, the government has ordered to permit these students to take the advanced supplementary exam in May.

Speaking to the media here on Tuesday, Yuva Bharat Force president Mohammed Sadiq alleged that that plant effluents, which has concentrated salt content, will negatively affect the growth of phytoplankton – feed for the fish – within 70-80 km radius of the plant and subsequently adversely effect the fish production.

“Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy is keen on setting up desalination plants in the coastal cities of Andhra Pradesh. He has recently met the representatives of IDE Technologies, an Israel-based company with expertise in operating desalination plants, and has asked the delegation to set up the plants in Andhra Pradesh, starting with Visakhapatnam. “The desalination plants will disturb marine life, which will consequently affect the fishermen. The effluents, with its high concentration of salt, will compel the fish to migrate away in large number from the coast. The effluent will affect the underwater temperature, which in turn will threaten various marine species and push them into extinction. We request the government to withdraw its proposal of setting up a plant in Visakhapatnam,” said Sadiq.

Sadiq added that about 540 fishing villages are situated along the coast of Andhra Pradesh with a fishermen population of 6 lakh. “A total of 31,318 fishing vessels, comprising 1871 mechanised, 14,648 motorised and 14,799 traditional fishing craft, are involved in marine fishing activity. All these fishermen will be affected by the setting up of the desalination plants,” said Sadiq.

HYDERABAD: A local court has acquitted Abdul Kareem Tunda from all the charges in the 1998 case of Saleem Junaid conspiracy module to carry out serial blasts in the city during the Ganesh immersion procession. Police sources said lack of material evidence to support confessions could be the reason for the acquittal.

Though he has been acquitted in the case, he would not be released from a Ghaziabad jail, where he is incarcerated, as he is an accused in several other cases. Tunda, 77, a native of Uttar Pradesh, worked in Delhi for a long time. He has been named accused in several terror-related cases across the country. In 2013, Delhi police and central intelligence agencies had arrested him on Indo-Nepal border.

Special Investigation Team (SIT) police of Hyderabad arrested Tunda in August 2013 in the Saleem Junaid conspiracy module case of 1998. Saleem Junaid, a Pakistan national, was arrested in the city in July 1998 along with two of his associates in possession of grenades, RDX and fire arms. “Junaid brought the explosives to Hyderabad in a tanker from Kutch in Gujarat to prepare IEDs and carry out serial blasts during the Ganesh immersion in the city,” an investigator said.

The court had convicted five persons, including Saleem Junaid, Mohammed Mansoor, Farooq Ahmed, Mohammed Omer and Mohammed Ismail, in the case. “All the convicted accused, including Saleem Junaid completed their sentences much before the arrest of Tunda. Saleem Junaid even returned to his country, Pakistan,” a police officer said.

Police sources said that other than the confessions of Saleem Junaid and a hotel owner from Hyderabad saying that they went to Bangladesh and learnt IED-making techniques from the accused, they did not have any supporting evidence to prove the charges.

While some end up with complications at the emergency unit, some go for elective surgeries like cataract.With lifespans getting longer, geriatric surgeries are now common. Cataract operations have no age limit, said Dr Shalini Shetty, senior consultant, department of ophthalmology, Apollo Hospitals. “Due to poor mobility, older people spend most of their time reading, watching TV and video chatting with family abroad. They are scared of losing their vision completely after surgery, and fear pain, anaesthesia and hospital stay. In some cases, these factors make them defer the surgery, and poor vision affects their quality of life,” explained Dr Shetty.A 96-year-old woman was recently brought to the emergency unit of Columbia Asia hospital with severe abdominal pain and vomiting. “It was a case of hernia and we had to go for an emergency surgery. The patient had cardiac issues and was on medication. Three days after the surgery, she was discharged and able to walk,” said Dr Anand NS, consultant laparoscopic surgeon, Columbia Asia.Citing another case of a 94-year-old woman who underwent elective surgery for hernia and a 4-cm gallstone, Dr Anand said if families of older patients keep a close watch on their health and get medical intervention at the right time, emergency cases can be prevented.Uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension and breathing problems are the risks involved in operating upon older patients, say doctors. “Surgeries like cataract carry no risk; local anaesthesia is administered in the form of eye drops,” said Dr Shetty.Hip, wrist and spine fractures are other commonly seen problems during old age. A 95-year-old woman who had fractured her left hip after falling in the bathroom underwent surgery at Manipal Hospitals in mid-February. Dr Sunil Kini, senior consultant, joint replacement and arthroscopy surgeon at Manipal Hospitals, who sees 1-2 cases of geriatric patients with history of a fall, said, “While wrist fracture can be treated with plaster and medicines, two months’ rest can heal spine fracture. But patients with hip fracture need to be operated upon within 48 hours of the fall. Otherwise, it can lead to deep vein thrombosis, a serious condition.”Maintenance of electrolyte balance has to be followed prior and post surgery among geriatric patients, he added.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74473725,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-337294,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/age-no-bar-patients-in-90s-now-heading-to-ots/articleshow/74465100.cms

DEHRADUN: The members of Uttarakhand Unemployed People 's Union performed a “budhi shudhi yagya” for the state government at the Parade Ground in Dehradun on Tuesday. The youths have been protesting against the recent instance of cheating in the forest guard recruitment exam and the alleged failure of state government to provide jobs to them. The protesters have decided to sit on an indefinite hunger strike at the Parade Ground from Wednesday (March 4) if the government doesn’t declare the recruitment examination void.

“The eight accused, who have been arrested for their involvement in the cheating scam, have confessed that they had got the question paper 30 minutes before the exam began. Why isn’t the government declaring the exam void then? We have conducted this “budhi shudhi yagya” to make the state government realise that it is playing with the career of youngsters of this state by turning a blind eye towards this cheating scam,” said Bobby Panwar, chairperson of Uttarakhand Unemployed People's Union.

The agitating youth demand that the forest guard recruitment exam should be re-conducted within 100 days. Besides, they demand the state government to release its annual calendar of recruitment examinations.

Meanwhile, the Uttarakand Subordinate Service Selection Commission (UKSSSC) has not taken any decision on the matter so far as they are awaiting the final outcome of the probe. “We cannot take any decision unless cops give us a final conclusion of their investigation. Our decision will solely depend on the findings of the probe,” said Santosh Badoni , UKSSSC secretary.

Harak Singh Rawat, state forest minister, reacting to the agitation, asked the protesting youths to be patient and wait for the outcome of the police investigation.

Notably, a report published by the state government in December 2019, revealed that the unemployment rate of those in the age bracket 15-29 years in Uttarkhand has “doubled” since 2004-05. The report, based on the data collated till 2017, maintains that unemployment has gone up from 6% then to 13.3% now. The report further reveals that there is high unemployment among the residents of plains districts and urban areas of the state.

Vadodara: A senate member of MS University has alleged that there has been an “unwarranted” delay in declaring results of the 14th Gujarat State Eligibility Test (GSET) held in December last year.

GSET is conducted to determine eligibility of candidates from the state for assistant professor in universities and colleges of Gujarat. MS University which is the nodal agency for holding GSET had conducted the test in 23 subjects at 11 centres across Gujarat.

“It is now 60 days and unfortunately, the results have not been released putting careers of thousands of candidates at risk,” said senate member Kapil Joshi.

Joshi claimed that even results of National Eligibility Test (NET) where lakhs of students appear have been declared within 30 days.

“GSET was held with objective type and multiple-choice questions format. Computers can generate results within few moments,” Joshi added.

He said that a number of universities across the state including neighbouring Sardar Patel University in Anand have published notifications inviting applications from candidates for the post of assistant professors. “Because of this unfortunate delay, many candidates have lost chances to participate in the interview process,” claimed Joshi.

Professor C N Murthy, GSET’s member secretary, told TOI, that there has not been any undue delay in declaration of results.

“Normally, it takes 45 days to two months to declare the results. We conducted the test on December 29 last year after which as per the norms, we have to resolve queries that we receive from students. Once we receive queries, we call experts from varied streams to address those queries and after that the results are prepared and declared,” he said.

“In the past too, when we have conducted exams in the month of September, the results have been declared in the month of December. So, there is nothing unusual this time,” he said. Murthy added that GSET results are expected to be declared in mid-March.

The 14th GSET had witnessed a record number – 25,423 – candidates appeared for the test.

He further said that since the high court had ordered to confine reservations to 50% and there was no time to approach the Supreme Court, YSRC will go ahead for elections with 50% reservations.

Speaking to the media on Tuesday, the deputy CM said that YSRC president YS Jaganmohan Reddy had promised to provide up to 60% reservation in local body polls. “Naidu had assigned Pratap Reddy to file a petition. Now he is throwing mud on YSRC. The Supreme Court, in its 2010 judgement, had said that reservations in local bodies should not cross 50%,” he added.

The revenue minister further said that this condition was not implemented in the 2013 elections because the SC had specifically said that the exemption would be only for that election. “Initially, we thought this condition would be implemented in education and jobs but not in education, but not elections. High court ruled this out and we don’t have time to approach the SC,” Pilli added.

DEHRADUN: Using a 'different' way to draw attention to the problem of rampant littering near commercial establishments, Dehradun Municipal Corporation ( DMC ) has decided to put up posters outside those commercial establishments who fail to keep their surrounding areas clean. The posters, officials said, are intended to be 'a wake-up call' for the particular business owner and has sentences like “See the dirtiest person who loves to live around filth”.

Such posters were put up during a random inspection conducted by a team of four sanitary inspectors from DMC on Monday. The officials inspected popular food joints and lounges at Rajpur Road. During the drive, garbage piles were found around the premises of several commercial establishments. The team also fined the owners of a few buildings that are currently under construction and have become a spot for dumping garbage.

Vinay Shankar Pandey, municipal commissioner, told TOI, “We had already instructed shop owners to keep dustbins outside their shops so that the waste can be easily collected by DMC vehicles. But we received the information that many shop owners have made it their habit to throw their garbage on road. The posters have been put up to make them realise that cleanliness can only be maintained when everyone participates in the movement equally”.

Meanwhile, DMC also launched a month-long cleanliness drive in different parts of the city from Monday. “Offenders would be fined in the range of Rs 500-Rs 5,000. If a business owner doesn’t pay the fine, such posters would be put up outside that particular commercial premise,” added Pandey.

VADODARA: A special POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) court denied bail to Jaso Solanki and Kishan Mathasuriya, arrested in connection with Navlakhi gang rape case , here on Tuesday.

The duo, currently lodged in Vadodara Central Jail, approached the court on February 26 seeking bail as chargesheet in the case has been submitted by police and trial begun. The two accused claimed that they are the sole breadwinners of their families and that if they are denied bail, they will not be able to legally defend themselves during the trial. The duo also claimed they will regularly appear before the court during the trial and that there is no question of their fleeing as they own properties in their native places. The bail applications were opposed by police as well as by special public prosecutor Pravin Thakkar. Arguing against the bail pleas, Thakkar told court that medical evidence shows that the duo was involved in the crime. Police also said the accused live on roadside hutments in Vadodara and there is no proper description available about their native places. It was also argued that Mathasuriya was also involved in a robbery case registered at Raopura police station.

The court upheld submissions of Thakkar and police. Special POCSO judge R T Panchal stated in his order that just because chargesheet has been filed, the duo cannot be granted bail. The court also observed that taking into consideration the crime that the duo has committed, there is a possibility that they will run away.

VADODARA: A right to information (RTI) activist and a driver of a pickup van were arrested on Tuesday for abusing and threatening a head constable of city police’s traffic branch at Khodiyarnagar crossroads.

Head constable Dinesh Jeevanlal stopped the pickup van driver Arvind Solanki at the crossroads. Jeevanlal and a few other traffic cops were deployed at the busy junction to serve pending e-challans to vehicles by checking through a mobile phone application. When Jeevanlal entered the pickup van’s registration details, the application showed that Solanki had to pay Rs500 for an e-challan issued on January 21.

On being asked to pay the fine, Solanki refused to pay the money and instead called RTI activist Atul Gamechi. Solanki told cops that Gamechi owns the pickup van and he works for him. When Gamechi reached the crossroads, he allegedly started abusing the traffic constable and asked him who had given him authority to check Solanki’s driving licence.

Jeevanlal said when he asked Gamechi to not abuse, he and Solanki started threatening him that he will lose his job over this. As the arguments heated, a huge crowd gathered at the spot, due to which Jeevanlal called police control room. A PCR van took the duo away to Warasia police station. Later Jeevanlal gave a complaint against them on the basis of which an offence of criminal intimidation and obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions was registered.

GAIRSAIN: As soon as governor Baby Rani Maurya began her speech on the first day of the budget session , Congress MLAs entered the well of the House and raised slogans against the state government. Outside the assembly, members of state General and OBC Employees Association and Uttarakhand Kranti Dal staged a massive protest. While the General and OBC Employee Association members showed black flags and demanded immediate start of promotion in government jobs, the UKD members were in favour of Gairsain being made the state capital.

Barring leader of opposition Indira Hridayesh, the remaining 10 Congress legislators entered the well of the House in favour of their demands which included, appointment of Lokayukta, extension of ongoing budget session and issues related to people living in the hills should be discussed.

Congress MLA from Kedarnath Manoj Rawat said, “A major point raised by us was why assembly session is not held on Monday. There is a deliberate attempt on part of the BJP government to avoid session on Monday as it is the answering day for CM, who holds the charge of most departments. Many questions related to these departments are lying pending as assembly is not held on Monday. We have asked the government to hold assembly on Mondays as well so that the questions related to CM’s departments can be answered.” Rawat added that since BJP has come to power in 2017, the CM has replied to questions in the state assembly for only one day.

He further added that the state government was completely ignorant on the issue of problems faced by people of the hills. “The state government has turned a blind eye to issues related to wild animals, agriculture, migration and camping in bugyals,” said Rawat.

Congress state chief and Chakrata MLA Pritam Singh asserted, “The government is merely fulfilling the formality by hold a five-day session, of which one is reserved for governor’s address. The budget session must be extended for a few more days to give time to lawmakers to express their views and suggest the required changes.”

Meanwhile, led by their chairman Deepak Joshi, members of General-OBC Employee Association staged a protest at Diwalikhal, where they were stopped by police. The protestors showed black flags to legislators and even stopped the vehicle of BJP state chief Bansidhar Bhagat .

Joshi said, “We will not stop till the time the state government agrees to follow the Supreme Court order. From March 5, we will stop emergency services and the indefinite strike, which started on Monday, will continue. We are not afraid of any action against us. This is the fight of lakh of employees and it will be continue till justice is done.”

UKD chief Diwakar Bhatt said that the assembly session at Gairsain should not be limited to a “picnic for legislators”. He added that “the BJP government needs to immediately declare Gairsain state capital”.

Responding to the queries, CM Trivendra Singh Rawat said, “Congress has no issue or point to raise. Therefore, the focus of the party MLAs is to create pandemonium and disrupt the House proceedings.” On the issue of the budget, he said, “We are coming up with a good budget which will have some new provisions. The Congress has been in power in Uttarakhand for 10 years but they never presented a good budget.” On protesting government employees, the CM said, “We have discussed the issue with them and at present the focus should be on taking the state on the path of progress.”

HARIDWAR: The state health department has sought help from a few select private hospitals to treat pilgrims during Kumbh Mela 2021. State health secretary Pankaj Pandey made the announcement after inspecting all three government hospitals in Haridwar and reviewing the health services in the district a few days ago. He also said that shortage of medical and paramedical staff at Kumbh mela will be compensated through outsourcing.

“Keeping in view the shortage of doctors and paramedical staff, the administration has decided to enlist the support of some private hospitals, including Max, Metro, Fortis, Kailash, Medanta and Six Sigma, besides that of AIIMS Rishikesh. Some of the hospitals have already accepted the government request and agreed to offer their services,” Haridwar chief medical officer (CMO) Saroj Naithani told TOI.

Also, around 50 ambulances, including four with advanced life support, two with basic life support, water and mobile ambulances, will be pressed into service.

“A grant of Rs 32 crore will be released in two installments for health department works, which will be done in two phases. The funds will be used to augment existing facilities as well as build new ones. For instance, a cardiology unit and a facility for regular eye surgery will be set up,” Naithani said.

In Kumbh 2021 , 320 beds will be available for patients as opposed to the 250 beds that were there in the previous 2010 Kumbh, officials said. A prefabricated hospital with 40 to 50 beds will be set up in Bhopatwala area in north Haridwar, as the facility to be built in an area under the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) is unlikely to be finished before Kumbh.

“A temporary hospital will start functioning before Kumbh starts and will continue operations till the proposed NRHM project is executed. Apart from that, two sub-hospitals will function at Jwalapur and Bahadarabad in the district and one will cater to patients in Rishikesh,” Naithani added.

According to sources, the government will also release Rs 3 crore to refurbish three government hospitals in Haridwar -- Harmilap Hospital, Chainrai Women Hospital and Mela Hospital. Apart from this, Rs 3.7 crore will be spent on purchasing drugs. The health department will receive another Rs 3.5 crore to purchase equipment and instruments such as MRI machines, C-Arm machines, digital X-ray machines, bed-head monitors for emergency units and for setting up a four-bed ICU and a cardiac unit.

VADODARA: With delays continuing to mar the Sanjaynagar housing scheme for the urban poor, the uprooted and miffed residents are up in arms against the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC).

The Sanjaynagar housing scheme has been a jinxed affair ever since 1,841 dwelling were razed there in July 2017 promising the residents there houses in a high-rise housing scheme under the Pradhan Mantri Aavas Yojana (PMAY.

The civic body had given a contract for construction of 2,637 houses there under a public-private partnership model. The land after constructing the 2,637 houses in highrise buildings was to be awarded to the realtor for monetization.

A series of hurdles including the change of stakes in the partnership firm floated by the realtors that sparked a row, delay in transfer of land held by government departments and suits by individuals claiming land at the site kept delaying the project. The realtor too has been irregular in payment of the rent of Rs 2,000 each to families whose houses were razed.

VMC teams razed eight illegal shades erected for dwellings on the land where the project is to come up. A VMC official said that the encroachments were being sighted as one of the reasons for the delay in commencement of work at the site. After the removal of encroachments, work should ideally begin soon.

But with no signs of work beginning at the site, those who were ousted from the site have taken up the issue with the VMC. A protest was held on Monday and more are on the cards if work does not begin.

Seema Rathod who has been fighting for those ousted from Sanjaynagar said that the developer has now said that it would not be possible to begin work immediately and workers would go to their native places for Holi celebrations. “They are saying that work will now begin after Holi festivities get over,” she said.

In-charge city engineer P M Patel said that a meeting was held with the developer to discuss the project. ""We have asked him to commence work soon. The contractor has promised to do so after Holi,"" Patel said.

The residents have threatened that if work did not begin as per the promise, they will enter the land again and settle there. They are complaining that houses are not available on rent for Rs 2,000 and even this small amount was delayed. “When the rent of three months is pending, two months’ rent is paid,” said Rathod.

315,['4/03/2020'],"Congress, BJP at loggerheads over budget session duration","Representative image

GAIRSAIN: The first day of the budget session saw a heated exchange of words between the Congress and BJP legislators over the issue of duration of the session. Citing assembly manuals, Congress said that the session should be of at least 19 days as it was linked with the future of people as the budget is for them. On the other hand, BJP said that the budget session was being held in accordance with earlier ones which has continued for the past two decades.

On hearing both the sides, speaker Prem Chand Agarwal said that the matter is being reviewed. “I have received a request from Congress and it is being reviewed. Will take a call after going through the facts.”

Congress MLA Qazi Nizam-ud-Din had raised the issue in the House in the afternoon hours. “According to the assembly manuals, three days is reserved for the governor’s speech and debate on it. However, this time the budget will be presented on Wednesday just a day after the governor’s address. This contradicts the process laid down in the manuals,” he said adding that it leaves virtually no time for debate.

The Congress lawmaker further stated that the manual has also laid down a time period of 19 days to present the budget and for department-wise debate. “I fail to understand why the government is in such a hurry. It is evident that the BJP government is not interested in holding a session at Gairsain,” he added.

Leader of opposition, Indira Hridayesh , supported of the party MLA and sought an extension of the session. “When other states can do so, then why not in Uttarakhand. With just four days, when will the budget be presented, debated and then passed in the House. Mere formalities are being fulfilled under the cover of holding an assembly session at Gairsain,” said the legislator from Haldwani.

Meanwhile, BJP refuted these allegations and said that Congress is delaying business by disruptions in the House.

Urban development minister Madan Kaushik said, “Congress was in power for 10 years and for five years Hridayesh was the parliamentary affairs minister. Then why were these guidelines not followed during her tenure. Had she forgotten the manuals. The budget session at Uttarakhand is being held as per the tradition of last 20 years. Secondly, if Congress wants the session at Gairsain to be extended, they why is it disrupting the House and delaying work.”

316,['4/03/2020'],High court dismisses contempt petition against Ayurvedic College,"Representative image

NAINITAL: In a major relief to the Himalayan Ayurvedic Medical College , the Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Tuesday dismissed the contempt petition against it.

This comes just a day after the court had taken into custody the principal of the college who was let go only after the counsel appearing for them promised that the managing director of the institute will appear in person.

However, as the proceedings began on Tuesday, it was pointed out to the single judge bench of Justice Sharad Kumar Sharma that the copy of the order presented with the petition does not belong to the petitioner. “The court while hearing a bunch of petitions had ordered all the colleges to refund the extra money that they had charged from students. The current petition has been filed by a student named Manish Kumar while the order copy attached here was of someone else. Therefore, the court dismissed the petition,” said advocate Vinod Tiwari, the counsel appearing for the petitioner.

Tiwari, however, said that the court has given them liberty to file another petition which will be done soon. “The court didn’t say that our grounds were not legitimate. It was a technical matter which will be sorted out soon and a fresh case will be filed before the high court soon,” Tiwari added.

As reported by TOI earlier, the state government, through a Government Order (GO) had in October 2015 increased the fee of Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medical Sciences (BAMS) by almost Rs 1.4 lakh. The fee was increased retrospectively. However, after a petition was filed, the court quashed the GO and ordered all the colleges to return the extra fee that had been charged from the students. The colleges then filed a Special Leave Petition (SLP) before the division bench. However, that appeal was also dismissed by the court and they were again ordered to return the fee. However, as the colleges did not return the amount again, students approached the court and filed a contempt petition against the college.

317,['4/03/2020'],"Punjab stares at Rs 25,000 crore burden from faulty PPAs","Punjab CM Amarinder Singh (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The Punjab government is staring at a cumulative financial burden of over Rs 25,000 crore from litigation over faulty power purchase agreements with two private power plants, which were set up after power demand was artificially increased and then, the excess power generated by these plants was surrendered, the state’s top law officer has said.

After Punjab State Power Corporation Ltd (PSPCL) artificially raised the state’s power demand from 1,800 mw to 3,100 mw in 2007 and then by a further 2,100 mw in 2008, two power plants were set up by Talwandi Sabo Power Ltd (TSPL) and Nabha Power Ltd (NPL). PSPL entered into power purchase agreements (PPAs) with them on the basis of this artificially increased demand for power, state advocate general Atul Nanda said in his opinion to the Amarinder Singh government rendered two weeks ago.

For the power contracted but not utilised by PSPL, consumers had to pay ‘surrender charges’ of Rs 1,633.97 crore to NPL from 2012-13 to 2019-20 and Rs 2,050.37 crore to TSPL from 2014-15 to 2019-20.

Thus, Rs 3,684 crore was paid for surrendering excess power contracted by PSPL from the two power plants. Production of excess electricity expended extra fuel costing Rs 84 crore, Nanda said in his detailed opinion after studying documents relating to the state’s power sector for the last 15 years.

Despite the huge financial ramifications, the matter was referred to the AG only in the last week of December 2019. The AG expressed surprise at how the coal linkage decision, approved by the PSPCL board of directors and the council of ministers, for higher grade and cheaper coal from PSPCL’s captive Pachhwara coal mine was “dropped” by two officers. Use of coal from captive mines would have reduced the power tariff, he said.

The power companies imported coal at a much higher price and an additional Rs 400-500 crore per annum had to be passed on to consumers. Nanda also faulted PSPCL for seeking power tariff approval from the state electricity regulatory commission (SERC) based on wrong premises. “Petitions preferred by PSPCL for approval of tariff to be paid to NPL and TSPL were based on assumptions/factors which were either false, technically incorrect, contrary to decisions taken/approval given or otherwise contrary to law,” he said.

Explaining how power demand was exaggerated, Nanda said the four-month peak during the agriculture season was shown as 24x7 demand round the year. “There has been impermissible deviations from the 2005 Competitive Bidding Guidelines and aspects which are required to be corrected/reviewed and remedied and which would then have a significant impact leading to a revised/reduced tariff structure,” he said.

Advising the state to initiate urgent measures in SERC to review approved tariff to save money, Nanda gave a chilling account of what lay in future. “A rough and ready analysis of such litigation (linked to a myriad issues relating to faulty PPAs) shows that the financial burden of all this litigation would be a cumulative and staggering amount of at least Rs 25,030 crore on PSPL which would then eventually be burdened on the state of Punjab and its electricity consumers,” he said.

Warning against routine litigation by PSPCL, Nanda said, “Given the staggering financial impact of all such litigation, PSPCL is advised not to deal with this litigation in a routine manner but to set up a specialised legal team which may handle such litigation in the four fora — courts where they will occur, that is district court Patiala (arbitration matters), Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission and Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, Punjab and Haryana High Court and the Supreme Court.”

318,['4/03/2020'],More schools join scheme to make students eat veggies,"Trichy: As more city schools started adopting Akshaya Pathiram scheme – a novel method to make children consume more vegetables along with their meal — a corporation primary school at Edaimalaipattipudur became the latest entrant to the list on Tuesday.

School children are asked to bring a few vegetables from home while coming to school which is cooked and served to them at the school. “These vegetables will be an add-on to the regular lunch for students who bring their food from home and for those who have their lunch at the school as part of noon meal scheme,” said assistant teacher H Pushpalatha. There are a total of 380 students at the school of which 200 are covered under the noon meal scheme.

While it was the government aided Subbaiah School that initiated the scheme, it is now being adopted by others as well.

Since children often hesitate to eat vegetables along with food at home, they were asked to bring vegetables from home and put them in an exclusive vessel named ‘Akshaya Pathiram’ at the school. Vegetables collected as part of the initiative are utilised to make the school’s noon meal which subsequently turns richer in vegetables.

Getting one or two vegetables from their kitchen while coming to school will not be a big task for children, said district elementary education officer K Maruthanayagam. “At the same time, we will make it a habit for these tender minds not to avoid vegetables,” he said.

The initiative also took shape because of complaints from many parents that their children were avoiding vegetables in their meal.

“Many children hesitate to take bitter gourd along with their food despite its nutritious value. We received around 5 kg of bitter gourd. Now parents can give these vegetables to their children which will be evenly distributed to all children,” he said.

Even the doctors were taken aback by the size of the tumour that weighed 9.5kg.

“This kind of an ovarian tumour is usually found in a post-menopausal woman. This is patient is a young woman,” said gynaecologist Payal Banerjee Roy at KPC Medical College, where the patient underwent the surgery. The tumour adhered to her bladder and the vessels supplying blood to pelvic organs and her legs. Doctors said this kind of fibrosis accounted for only about 4% ovarian tumours. A biopsy report proved it to be benign.

Other hospitals had allegedly turned her away, saying the operation was way too risky. At KPC Medical College, a multi-disciplinary team, comprising doctors Bala, Pushkar, Shyam Choudhury, Amitabha Chakrabarti and Payal Banerjee Roy, finally decided to take up the challenging surgery. “The patient is recovering. We plan to send her home soon,” said an official.

PANAJI/SALIGAO: On Tuesday, BJP announced its third list of eight candidates, and MGP announced its second list of three candidates for the zilla panchayat elections . The last day for the filing of nomination papers is March 5.

Speaking to mediapersons, BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade listed out the names of the eight candidates— six from South Goa and two from North Goa.

In South Goa, BJP named Shramesh Bhosle for the Betki-Khandola ZP seat, Shivram Naik for Veling-Priol, Sanjana Velip for Guirdolim, Suresh Kepekar for Rivona, Shobhana Velip for Poinguinim and Anita Thorat for Sancoale.

In North Goa, the party will field Diksha Kanolkar for Sirsaim and Shruti Ghatwal for Latambarce.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant told reporters that BJP would contest 43 seats out of the total 50.

“We are confident of winning the ZP polls in both districts. None of the recent issues will have an impact on our win— the people of Goa will vote for BJP as they trust the party wholly,” Sawant said. BJP has until now announced 39 candidates in total—23 in North Goa and 16 in the South.

A large number of BJP workers on Monday rallied behind Aldona BJP ZP candidate Manisha Naik after she came to file her nomination papers at the deptuy collector's office at Mapusa. Naik is currently the deputy Sarpanch of Bastora village panchayat and the president of the Aldona Mahila mandal.

Meanwhile, MGP will field Shailesh Naik for Kumbharjua and Pravin Vaigankar for Harmal, and Vinda Sawant will contest the Darbandora seat. The party has decided to contest 19 seats, and has already announced the names of 15 candidates.

322,['4/03/2020'],‘Power to choose tourism board should lie with goverment’,"Goa tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar (Image credit: Twitter)

PANAJI: There is still no clarity over the nature of the composition of the proposed Goa tourism board (GTB) under the draft tourism policy. Uncertainty has arisen after tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar raised the ante over allowing the tourism trade body the freedom to appoint its representatives on the board. Ajgaonkar wants the goverment to retain the power to appoint representatives of the tourism industry.

A heated discussion ensued at a meeting held last week to finalise the tourism master plan, a vision document initiated in 2014. The meeting was also attended by chief minister Pramod Sawant.

“The tourism minister is not in favour of the trade body choosing its representatives to be nominated to the board. He wants the power to appoint industry members,” said an official who present at the meeting.

A consensus on the composition of the board, he said, was reached a year ago. It was decided that the board will comprise members of the trade as well as government officials, with the tourism minister as chairman. It was agreed that five representatives of the tourism industry bodies would also be part of the 15 member-GTB.

The meeting, said the official, was inconclusive, with Ajgaonkar remaining adamant on his stand.

Ajgaonkar however said he was not opposed to having trade members on the board, provided the government appoints them. Let the president of the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) be a board member, but the other industry representatives should as per the government’s choice, the minister said .

“If they are allowed to nominate representatives , they (trade) will dictate terms to us,” he said.

It was proposed that members other than those from TTAG and Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI), shall hold a position for two years, on rotation-basis.

The TTAG is hoping that better sense will prevail, and their efforts of the last two years would not go to waste in finalising the finer points of the policy.

“It has taken more than three years for the tourism master plan to be drawn up, and the tourism policy drafted. We do not want any further delay,” a TTAG member said.

Their concern, he said, also stems from the ground reality that ministers ensure that persons of their choice - it could be a relative or a loyalist- are appointed to corporations which are governed by them.

“In the last two years, the GTDC board was changed thrice to accomodate such members. We do not want any non-professional, or a person having no sound knowledge of the tourism sector to be part of the GTB. That’s why it was suggested to appoint representatives of various bodies of the tourism sector,” he said.

The TTAG is concerned by the latest development but some members are confident that the chief minister will work out a solution. TTAG president Savio Massias declined to comment on the issue.

Besides the trade representatives, key officials of the tourism ministry – the tourism secretary, tourism director and managing director of the Goa State Tourism Corporation (GTDC) – were also to be appointed on the board. It was also decided that an environment expert will be included in the tourism board, and there is also a provision to appoint a qualified professional as its chief executive officer.

DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand’s tourism website — uttarakhandtourism.gov.in — was hacked by a group of Indonesian hackers called “One Hat Cyber Team” on Tuesday. The hackers took control of the website for a while and flashed a message saying — we are ‘Indonesian Muslim citizens’.

A tourism department spokesperson told TOI that the website has been secured now and is under maintenance. “A police complaint seeking cyber investigation has been filed and the website would be up and running shortly,” said the spokesperson.

The website is the only platform for all visitors who want to check out information like homestays, state-run guest houses, tenders, and all contacts of the state tourism department.

A police official posted at the cyber wing told TOI, “A complaint has been received from the Uttarakhand tourism department and the investigation to trace the hackers is on.”

Notably, the tourism department hires a private firm to maintain the website for smooth operations. In order to boost the tourism business in Uttarakhand, the tourism department had recently tied up with OYO, a mobile aggregator firm, for homestays and guest house booking.

324,['4/03/2020'],Tejas Exp move bemuses train stakeholders in coastal K’taka,"Mangaluru Central Railway station

Mangaluru: A move by Southern Railway (SR) to introduce Tejas Express between Mangaluru Central and Coimbatore has raised the hackles of local train activists. While the local stakeholders normally welcome the introduction of new trains, what has upset them this time is the denial of entry for intra-state trains, especially those operating to Bengaluru, to the Mangaluru Central station citing lack of availability of platform and termination of these trains at Mangaluru Junction itself.

The Inter-Railway Timetable Committee (IRTTC), that met in Bengaluru last week, approved the proposal by the Chennai-headquartered zonal railway to operate the new semi high-speed train with tentative departure of 6am from Mangaluru Central to reach Coimbatore at 12.10pm. The train is scheduled to depart Coimbatore at 2.30pm to reach Mangaluru Central at 8.40pm on all days except Mondays as per the timetable approved by IRTTC.

Pashchima Karavali Rail Yatri Abhivriddhi Samiti’s Anil Hegde, being critical of the “bias of Southern Railway”, said Yeshwantpur-Mangaluru Central tri-weekly express (train 16585) is departing Yeshwantpur at 4.30pm and arriving at Mangaluru Central at 3am. This is only due to the claim by Palakkad division, that controls Mangaluru Central, that no platform is available at Central after 5am. “How could SR find platform for Tejas Express?” he wondered.

Endorsing Hegde’s concerns, Sudarshan Puttur, convener of Kukke Subrahmanya-Mangaluru Rail Abhivriddhi Samiti, said Tejas proposal has exposed double standards of SR that is denying the entry of Karnataka trains into Mangaluru Central for a decade. “It did not allow Mumbai CSMT-Mangaluru-Mumbai CSMT superfast express into Central citing platform congestion while starting Mangaluru Central-Coimbatore Intercity Express in the interim,” he said.

Activists Raveendran Nambiar and Dinesh Bhat, both from Puttur, said SR cannot justify the non-availability of platforms to start and receive Karnataka trains at Central as four trains leave Central towards Kerala/ Tamil Nadu between 5am and 7.30am. Even when there is inordinate delay in constructing additional platforms at Central by SR, its move to push Tejas’ proposal is classic example for step-motherly treatment towards Karnataka, Bhat rued.

Yogendra Swamy, representing Mysuru Grahaka Parishat, said SR and Palakkad division have cited platform constraint to Karnataka trains, including Yeshwantpur-Mangaluru Junction-Yeshwantpur Gomateshwara Express, Vijayapura-Mangaluru Junction-Vijayapura special Express. “Won’t the same constraints apply to TN- and Kerala-bound trains?” he asked. The practice of using Mangaluru as the terminal for North Kerala should stop, he suggested.

Speaking on the developments,Pratap Singh Shami, divisional railway manager of Palakkad division, said he was not aware of the (Tejas Express) proposal. “Salem division must have sent the proposal. Palakkad division is yet to work on it,” he added.

325,['4/03/2020'],BDU to set apart 2 seats in each dept for wards of staff,"Trichy: Two separate seats will be created in each of the 40 departments in Bharathidasan University (BDU) to accommodate a ward each of the university’s teaching and administrative staff respectively who are unable to get seats. The decision which was taken based on the demand put forward by staff, especially from the administration, will come into effect from the coming academic year.

A committee was set up to analyse the demand and make recommendations for the approval of the vice-chancellor. Following this, a resolution was also passed at the recently held syndicate meeting and finance committee also approved it.

Welcoming the move, M Selvam, dean, faculty of management, and syndicate member, said securing seats in some of the popular university departments is indeed difficult. These include departments like Chemistry, Biotechnology, Physics and English. Saying that there will be 50% concession in fees for wards of class IV staff, he said the idea was to recognise staff who worked tirelessly for the development of the university by giving preference to their wards.

BDU registrar G Gopinath told TOI that there will not be any special treatment to the students claiming the two seats as they will have to follow all admission procedures followed by any other candidate. Only those wards of employees who were unsuccessful in making it to the merit list will be considered based on their request. Seats will be allotted on first come first serve basis if there are more than two candidates claiming the seats, he said.

On whether reservation policy is not applicable for these seats, he said they are not violating any norms as such. Recalling the practice of ‘merit-cum-means quota’ he said the university was reserving a few seats in some of the popular courses for those who can afford the seats by paying more than the stipulated fee.

“We are only adding two seats but wards of staff cannot get seats just like that and they must follow all procedures. This practice was there in the past but was suspended for some years in between as there were less takers,” said the registrar.

326,['4/03/2020'],‘Sufficient water in state’s dams to tide over summer’,"Panaji: With the onset of summer, reservoirs in the state are being closely monitored, WRD chief engineer Shrikant Patil said. Presently, two of the state’s biggest reservoirs, Anjunem and Selaulim, are 100% and 69% full, respectively.

The other important reservoir at Amthane, which supplies raw water to the Assonora water treatment plant, is at 72% capacity, WRD officials said.

The water level at Amthane had dropped to 32% in January, raising concerns for the approaching summer. This happened because the PWD stopped using raw water from the Tillari dam in Maharashtra for most parts of December and January, as it was highly turbid and instead, tapped the Amthane dam.

However, Patil said the PWD has resumed using water from Tillari for treatment at Assonora and that after pumping water from the Sal into Amthane, the reservoir is up to over 70% now.

During the monsoon of 2019, a wall of the Tillari canal had collapsed. It was repaired and supply to Goa from the Tillari dam resumed by December 10, 2019, but the water was still highly turbid.

Normally, Amthane acts as a back-up to meet shortages during the peak of summer. It supplies raw water to the Assonora plant, which supplies water to the whole of Bardez and large parts of Bicholim taluka.

“We are monitoring the reservoirs closely and ensuring that there will be no shortage in supply of raw water during the summer. We are also going to begin pumping water from the Selaulim into the Opa river early this year,” Patil said. The Opa water treatment plants supply water to Ponda and Tiswadi talukas.At present, Chapoli dam in Canacona is 79% full, while the Panchawadi reservoir is 50% full.

Last summer, Goa faced one of its worst water shortages. Levels in the Opa river had dropped below 3m , and the WRD was forced to tap bandharas and quarries to ensure basic water supply.

The GHMC had cut branches of a tree that remained uncleared at Kothapet for two days.,obstructing passage of vehicles and pedestrians in the area. A resident of the area, Nikhil Sai had raised a complaint over the same on TOI’s citizen journalist app. The resident complained that the uncleared branches kept on the sides narrowed down the road further, resulting in traffic congestion.

“Trees branches were sheared by the authorities in Kothapet but remained uncleared. This behaviour of the municipal corporation led to traffic congestion in the area,” stated Sai.

Soon after the complaint was published in the columns, the GHMC stepped in and cleared the green debris on February 28. Now, the residents of the locality have asked the GHMC to display similar swiftness in cleaning a park in the area. “There is a well near the location in a park which is full of waste, including plastic waste. It is very unhygienic for those who regularly visit the park to exercise as the well emits foul smell and has led to mosquito menace,” said Sai.

RUDRAPUR: Nine persons, including a former Uttar Pradesh minister and former district government counsel (DGC) of Udham Singh Nagar district were awarded imprisonment by the judicial magistrate at the district and sessions court on Tuesday for forging a bequest in order to grab 32 acres of land.

In May 2014, Prabhavati Devi had filed a complaint against nine people — Prem Prakash Singh, former legislator of Barhaj constituency in Deoria district of Uttar Pradesh; Singh’s wife Manju Lata Singh; son Shiv Vardhan Singh; daughter-in-law Nidhi Singh; former DGC Swatantra Bahadur Singh, ex-DGC’s wife Geeta Singh, daughter-in-law Shikha Singh, and two witnesses — Navnath Tiwari and Prem Narayan Singh.

Prabhavati Devi told the police that her father was a sepoy in the Azad Hind Fauj. He joined the police force after Independence and retired as a DSP. For his contribution to the freedom struggle, he was awarded 50 acres of land in Bagwala village, around five kilometers from the city. Singh passed away in June 1999 and the land was inherited by his only descendant Prabhavati Devi, who had moved to Sihaura village of Azamgarh (UP) after marriage.

She had alleged that as she could not come to watch her parental property often, the accused occupied her land by forging the will in the name of Prem Prakash Singh, who is a two-time MLA from Barhaj and a former minister as well. All of the accused were booked under sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forging documents), 468 (forging for the purpose of cheating), 471 (using forged document fraudulently as genuine), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 504 (intentionally insulting and provoking to break public peace) of the Indian Penal Code. On June 17, 2016, a chargesheet was filed in the court by the police which added sections 342 (wrongful confinement) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC in their report.

329,['4/03/2020'],Kolkata: March orders may impact Indian university image abroad,"KOLKATA: The back-to-back deportation orders to foreign students studying in universities in the state has led to anxiety and unease among the fraternity as well as academics. Many of them felt the recent incidents were an overreaction by the authorities and it might hurt India’s image abroad.A Polish student at Jadavpur University , Kamil Siedcynski, and Afsara Anika Meem, a Bangladeshi girl studying at Visva-Bharati, were recently issued “Leave India” order by Foreigners Regional Registration Officer in Kolkata for “improper conduct and violating visa norms” after they allegedly participated in anti-CAA protests.The marching order has so shaken a group of students from an Asian country studying at a university in the city that they have decided not to go anywhere near any protest venue. “This is a scary situation, where orders to leave India are being handed out to students without even giving them an opportunity to explain themselves,” said one of them. “There have been anti-citizenship protests at almost all colleges and universities in the city. They may issue deportation notice if one of us is spotted even watching the demonstrations from a distance.” Another student from a European country sounded equally anxious: “It is a dangerous practice, which may hinder student exchange programmes in future.”JU professor emeritus Sukanta Chaudhuri said, “Students will state their views and have the curiosity to visit rallies and take photographs. If they are doing something against the interest of the country, then such a reaction was acceptable but just for attending a rally or clicking photos, such a reaction is bit too strong. Foreign students, including Indians, take part in large-scale protests against politically unpopular movements abroad but I have not heard that anybody has suffered any consequences.”Presidency University dean Pradip Basu called it “a naked restriction on the freedom of expression in the world’s largest democracy with a democratic Constitution”. “Moreover, exchange of ideas on any topic will suffer within a university as there will be constant fear. Internationally, Indian universities may face issues,” he said. Echoing him, Partha Pratim Ray of Jadavpur University Teacher’s Association said, “India is known to accommodate every section of people from different parts of the world. The recent incidents will not only hurt India’s image in the academic world, but our students will also face problems outside.”Dean of students at St Xavier’s College Argha Banerjee, however, felt foreign students should exercise caution and not get directly entangled in the country specific political issues. “Everyone is entitled to his or her opinion and that should be respected in no uncertain terms. Students from abroad should focus on academic and cultural enrichment and exchange between the two countries. While they should have their share of opinions on global issues, like climate and environment, they should be careful not to get caught in specific political issues. But these students should have been issued a warning before being asked to leave the country. If they failed to adhere to the directives, only then they should have been asked to leave.”",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74472675,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-460974,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/march-orders-may-impact-indian-univ-image-abroad/articleshow/74466246.cms

332,['4/03/2020'],Delayed paddy harvest affects pulse cultivation,"The cultivation of pulses including black gram and green gram in the delta districts has come down drastically as farmers are able to sow only on 65 per cent of the normal area covered during the season. Farmers and agriculture department officials attributed this to the delayed paddy harvest due to unexpected rain in the delta districts.

Traditionally, farmers in Trichy , Thanjavur , Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts broadcast seeds of pulses manually amid standing samba paddy crop seven to 10 days before harvest. After a gap of about five years they were expecting bumper samba paddy harvest for the recent October - January season thanks to the continuous flow in Cauvery and adequate rain. However, the unexpected rain which lashed the delta districts in mid-January played spoilsport flattening thousands of acres of standing paddy which was ready to go for harvest in a few days. Hence the farmers could not cover the required acreage in pulse cultivation, they said.

K Rajamani, a Thanjavur farmer, said his samba paddy crops fell along the field itself. Though he sowed black gram on his two acres, only 80% of seeds germinated properly. Water stagnation on the field also prevented many farmers from sowing pulse seeds, he added. Though the harvest was being done manually earlier, machines are used now for harvesting paddy. This would cause damage to the pulse seeds already sown on about 20% area, they said.

Agriculture officials said only 3.67 lakh acres of the usual 5.65 lakh acres in three districts has been covered with pulses so far. “As of now, we have covered 1.62 lakh acres in Nagapattinam district against the targeted 2.25 lakh acres. Being a tail-end area, residual moisture will extend for some more days. So, we hope we will attain our target ”, S Panneerselvam, joint director of agriculture (in-charge) from Nagapattinam said.

Mangaluru: The Kundapur flyover is expected to be thrown open to traffic by March 31.

Shishu Mohan DGM and project director, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said the Kundapur flyover work is progressing at a brisk pace and should be completed by March 31.

The project director was responding to a grievance raised by Vignesh Shenoy, a resident of Kundapur, who had drawn Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s attention to the pending work. The grievance was examined by NHAI’s independent engineer Aarvee Associates, Architects Engineers and Consultants Private Limited, Udupi.

On the project, Shishu Mohan said that a vehicle underpass (VUP) was proposed at the ‘Y’ Junction near Shastri Circle.Various alternatives were studied for a feasible solution like double vent VUP and others. However, the public insisted on a flyover. Finally, a flyover of five spans was approved.

On in principle approval for a flyover, the concessionaire commenced work in June 2013 by providing diversion for traffic with safety barricading and completed the super structure in July 2018. Completion of the work was delayed due to paucity of funds. On June 21, 2019, the concessionaire submitted a plan for completion of work by December. However, it was delayed again due to financial problems and prolonged rains.

At a meeting in Bengaluru on December 10, 2019 and Gurugram on January 23 this year, the concessionaire promised to complete the work by March 31, stated Mohan.

Regarding the toll, NHAI said that toll is being collected only for the completed length of project and where traffic is plying. “Once the balance main carriageway work is completed, that portion will be added to the toll length and toll will be increased for the same.

Many Delhi schools have issued advisories to parents, requesting them to keep their wards at home if they show respiratory symptoms such as cold and cough.Shri Ram School, Vasant Vihar, said it will remain closed from Thursday, while its Aravali and Moulsari campuses will be shut from March 9. The report cards will be sent online, while the other events of the schools have been postponed. “The spring break has been advanced by a few days. The holidays will be utilised for sanitisation work. This is being done as a precautionary measure,” the school said.The school has sent a detailed advisory to the parents on the precautionary measures they should take as also the steps being taken by the school itself. A note sent to the parents read: “We are doing regular handwashing in class for the children, teachers and didis, also along with our usual hand-sanitising sessions. Our washrooms are also cleaned and sanitised at frequent intervals.” The school also requested parents of the children who had recently acquired flu to submit fitness certificates from their paediatricians.Another school has asked parents to educate their house helps and drivers about the virus. While Sardar Patel Vidyalaya urged parents not to believe in rumours, it also requested them to keep the authorities informed if their child was suffering from cold and cough. The school, in a note, stated: “Even if any other member of the family has such symptoms, please do inform the vidyalaya so that appropriate preventive measures can immediately be taken at this end.”Apart from general guidelines, the schools have suggested that consumption of raw and undercooked meats be avoided. “Avoid crowded public places and close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness. Practice frequent hand washing with soap and good personal hygiene. Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose,” a note by another school stated. It also mentioned that masks neither guaranteed prevention of the spread of coronavirus nor were they an alternative to quarantine.

336,['4/03/2020'],"We are doing our job very honestly, says ACB’s affidavit in irri scam PIL","Nagpur: The state’s anti-corruption bureau (ACB) in an affidavit has said that the agency has been doing its job honestly and so, there’s no need to hand over the probe into the alleged irrigation scam to any other agency.

The affidavit that was filed in response to a PIL by activist Atul Jagtap seeking transfer of the investigation in the case to CBI, says adding new respondents and handing over the probe to any other agency will only hamper the pace of the investigations.

The ACB has stressed that it will be conducting the inquiries entrusted to it diligently and so there is no need to transfer the case anywhere else.

The PIL was filed after the ACB had filed an affidavit giving a clean chit to NCP leader Ajit Pawar who was the deputy chief minister in the then Congress-NCP government during whose tenure the alleged irregularities took place. Later, Pawar once again took over as the deputy chief minister in the MVA government.

The case is being heard by the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court. The PIL has also sought to make central agencies like the CBI, ED, and SFIO as the respondents in the case. However, the court had also rejected the plea for addition of parties in the matter on a temporary basis. The next hearing in which the inclusion of other agencies will also be heard is slated for March 13.

The ACB affidavit says that the special investigation teams (SITs) formed by the bureau have made substantial progress. The agency has progressed a way long in the case and adding new respondents and handing over the case to any other agency will only hamper the pace of investigations.

The Amravati unit filed 12 offences, while the Nagpur unit registered 27. At the same time, open inquiries of 15 projects have been completed and closed as no criminal offence was found, said the affidavit.

The affidavits said the investigators have also shown honest endeavour considering the voluminous documents to be scrutinized and statements to be recorded. The cases are being investigated by the Amravati and Nagpur units of ACB.

The Nagpur ACB is investigating the contracts given for Gosikhurd projects. Investigations by the Amravati ACB cover the Jigaon dam in Buldhana district apart from the Lower Pedhi, Raigargh and Wadhadi projects in Amravati district.

337,['4/03/2020'],Afcons gets 2nd penalty notice of Rs245cr in excavation case,"Nagpur: Wardha district administration has served second penalty notice of Rs244.64 crore to Mumbai-based Afcons Infrastructure Limited for excavating murrum without permission from 22 land parcels in Selu tehsil for construction of Samruddhi Mahamarg. With earlier penalty of Rs238.99 crore, the total amount goes up to Rs483.63 crore if the latest penalty is confirmed.

Selu tehsildar Mahendra Sonone served a show cause notice to projects manager of Afcons asking why penalty of Rs244.64 crore should not be recovered. “Submit reply to the notice within 15 days. Order will be passed and penalty amount will be recovered forcefully in case no reply is given in time period,” Sonone said.

In similar case of Hyderabad-based Cozy Properties, Sonone had first served show cause notice and then finalized the same penalty amount rejecting the reply filed by Afcons, citing various reasons already in the notice.

TOI had, in August last year, exposed excavation of murrum by Afcons and its petty contractors for construction of Nagpur-Mumbai Samruddhi Mahamarg without permission from land owned by Cozy Properties, other private persons and zudpi jungle, hillock owned by government, forest land under forest department, Digras lake and extra excavation from Bor river at mouza Charmandal, Kotumba, Itala and Ganeshpur.

Wardha district administration had conducted preliminary survey in August and served notices to Afcons in September. But penalty was not levied in case of land owned by government and private parties other than Cozy Properties.

TOI had sought statements from Wardha collector Vivek Bhimanwar and sub divisional officer Suresh Bhoyar on Sunday and Monday. TOI had highlighted that no action has been taken despite passing of six months.

Sonone issued show cause notice to Afcons on Monday. The notice dated February 20 was issued a day ago, as TOI has copy of the letter with received date of Monday by Afcons. This shows notice was ready but issued only after TOI report.

Also, MLC Girish Vyas had submitted LAQ on this topic in ongoing budget session.

An Afcons spokesperson told TOI, “Afcons denies any illegal excavation of murrum in the survey areas referred to in the show-cause notice. It may also be noted that similar issue is sub judice before Nagpur bench of Bombay high court, wherein the HC had granted stay in favour of Afcons. Afcons shall take necessary steps in response to the show cause notice in due course.”

Though Sonone mentioned excavation of murrum without permission in 24 land parcels, penalty has been calculated for only 22. Two excluded land parcels are khasra no-7 of mouza Itala, which is reserved for zudpi jungle, and khasra no. 65 of mouza Giroli, which is hillock. These two land parcels are owned by the state government.

In September last year, Sonone had also confirmed excavation in these two land parcels in notice issued on the basis of preliminary survey.

TOI had also reported excavation of murrum without permission from forest land with khasra no. 206 of mouza Kotumba quoting activists from Kotumba. However, there is no mention about this land in notice.

Bhoyar said, “Survey through electronic total station (ETS) system is pending on land parcels — khasra no. 7 of Itala and khasra no. 65 of Giroli, so penalty amount is yet to be calculated. Appropriate action will also be taken in these two land parcels and remaining ones soon,” he said.

Penalty amount will increase if charges are also fixed in remaining land parcels.

However, Wardha district administration is yet to register any case with the police in all these cases. In case of Cozy Properties, Selu police had registered the case and also arrested the concerned persons.

Of total 25 land parcels, 22 are owned by private persons and remaining three by government. There is ban on giving lease of government land. Also, permissions are not given on zudpi and forest lands, and any excavation attracts charges of Forest Conservation Act.

After sustaining minor injuries, 30-year-old Sharad Sable rushed to Ajni police station and submitted a written complaint against unidentified doctors. GMCH dean has constituted an internal committee to probe the matter.

“I was working on a OPD window reserved for government staffers and senior citizens. An intern doctor from GMCH brought his mother to the hospital at around 10.15am, and insisted that I should register her at my counter. As her card was of general category, I asked him to get her registered at the general window. This enraged the intern, and he threatened me with dire consequences,” said Sable.

At around 1pm, when the OPD registration closed, the same doctor came back to SSH with four or five friends.

“They shouted at me, pulled me out of the registration counter, and one of them slapped me on the face. They tried to assault me but I was saved by fellow staffers and people around. They ran away when other staff members came to my help,” he said.

Sable claimed he does not know these doctors by name but he noted the registration numbers of their bikes when they were moving out of SSH premises.

The association of medical college employees has decided to gherao the dean’s office on Wednesday. Trisharan Sahare, president of the Vidarbha Medical and Health staffers’ Association, said they will resort to strike if intern doctors responsible for this attack are not punished.

“Class IV employees will go on strike from 10am on Wednesday and we won’t resume work unless the administration takes action against the culprit doctors. No one can assault government staffers who work for patients,” he said.

Dean Dr Sajal Mitra said an internal committee has been constituted to investigate the matter and those who attacked the staffer will face action.

339,['4/03/2020'],Waiving dead farmers’ dues helps heirs get loans,"Nagpur: The state’s loan waiver scheme helps banks recover pending dues of the farmers’ no longer alive. In the first list of eligible farmers released in Nagpur division , there were at least seven persons who are no more. Four were from in Wardha and three from Nagpur, said sources.

As the case was referred to higher ups by the district officers, it was clarified that the legal heirs of the farmers could register themselves. The dead borrower’s Aadhaar number will be replaced by that of the heirs. After that, the amount will be repaid to the bank by state government, said a source.

This will help the survivors clear the charge on the land they inherit. However, it will not bring any cash benefit to the relatives because the amount will directly go to the bank. The process has nothing to do with the inheritance of the property either, said an officer handling the waiver cases.

Once the list is out and the borrower is dead, the legal heirs can report the matter and replace the Aadhaar number so the amount is credited to the loan account. The provision was there in the waiver scheme of previous government too.

The MVA scheme covers loans up to Rs2 lakh. On the basis of the first list, farmer will have to provide biometric matching for their Aadhaar numbers provided to the bank. Aadhaar is taken at the time of granting loans as a part of know your customer (KYC) norms, said a source.

In the scheme launched during BJP regime, the farmer was suspposed to apply for the waiver. In case the borrower had died, the heirs could apply on the person’s behalf after going through the verification process, an official said.

341,['4/03/2020'],"At 61, Everest trek provides life lesson","My love for the mountains took me on a gruelling hike to the base of the world’s highest peak - Mount Everest. And the experience was nothing short of life changing.

Reaching an altitude of 5,545 meters in two weeks was a challenge for a novice like me. The trek was scheduled for May 2012 and my training started three months before that. I brisk-walked for nearly two hours daily and a month before the trek, I started walking in my new trekking shoes with a back pack with nearly 3 kg weight.

The average age of the 14 trekkers in our group was 25. Only my friends and I were above the age of 50. And at 61, I was the one with most life experiences to share and the most excited to make new memories.

The group met in Kathmandu and flew to a small village named Lukla. We had to trek for nearly four hours from the airport to reach our night halt. I fell sick on the second day but luckily for me,this happened on our altitude acclimatisation day and I soon got better.

By the third day, I felt that the air was becoming thinner and I needed to activate all my senses to stay focused. I think my sudarshan kriya ( breathing exercises),which I practised every morning before starting for the trek, came to my aid.

But the more I progress I made on the trek, the more confident I became. My boots felt more comfortable, my bag felt lighter. The lovely weather, incredible views of snow-capped mountains and beautiful flower filled valley gave us all strength.

The journey was demanding in many ways, we walked across 100-feet high suspension bridges made of mostly rope, stayed in quaint tea houses. Sometimes we had to climb up 7-8 storeys to reach our rooms which seemed to be an steep task after a 9-10 hour long hike. The cold was excruciating, and sometimes drinking water would harden up into ice.

But the pros far outnumber the cons. It snowed on the seventh day, adding beauty to our trek. But when the sun came out, the ice hardened and it became slippery. making the hike significantly tougher. When we reached Gorakshep, just one stop short of our final destination, some of us started doubt if we would be able to make the last stretch.

Both my friends decided they couldn’t do it. I realised then that I would have to rely on my mental strength to make it through the last stretch and that our mental strength was more important that our physical prowess.

The climb to the Gorakshep was very steep and I slipped, but was saved by a fellow trekker. With nothing more to stop me, I made it to the Everest base camp . It was an incredible moment and I felt like I was on top of the world. Through this journey, I felt closer to nature and God, and the beauty of the world left me humbled.

342,['4/03/2020'],"Caught on cameras: Just 24,000 traffic challans in six months in Delhi","Picture used for representational purpose only

NEW DELHI: The Delhi traffic police have issued only 21,406 notices for red light, stop line , driving against flow of traffic and speeding violations caught by cameras in the capital in the past six months since the amended Motor Vehicle Act came into force. On the contrary, the number of notices issued for such violations captured by such cameras was as high as 24.36 lakh during the previous seven months, which comes to over 3.48 lakh challans issued every month.

In a written reply, MoS (home affairs) G Kishan Reddy indicated how the number of challans issued has been impacted as the Delhi government has not yet authorised traffic police to compound the challan amount, which is necessary under the amended MV law.

As per the new system (detection of violations by cameras), notices were sent by Delhi Police electronically through SMS to the violators and e-payment gateway facility was given for depositing the challan amount. However, after the notification of the amended MV Act with effect from September 1, 2019, the process had to be stopped since traffic personnel of Delhi Police have not been authorised to compound the challan amount by the Delhi government, Reddy said.

Compounding offences are those for which a spot fine is allowed and the driver doesn’t need to visit a court. The violator can pay the fine to the designated official after the respective state governments notify such officers.

The Act says offences under 24 categories can be compounded at any stage which include not having PUC, not wearing seatbelt or helmet, driving without licence or insurance, honking in silent zones. For these, the respective state government can notify its own quantum of fine and other penalties within the range which have been provided in the MV Act.

343,['4/03/2020'],EU lawmakers support PM Narendra Modi’s efforts to tackle cross-LoC terror,"SWITZERLAND: Members of the European Parliament have backed PM Narendra Modi ’s efforts in defeating cross-border terrorism, and rejected Pakistan’s narrative on the Kashmir issue following the Indian government’s move to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution.

The discussion in this regard took place at an event held at Geneva Press Club on Monday to discuss and assess the situation in Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370. Gianna Gancia, a member of the European Parliament, criticised Pakistan for portraying a picture of crisis in Kashmir on the international platforms.

Nathan Gill, a former member of the European Parliament and member of the Brexit party of Britain said, “What right has Pakistan to discuss the internal affairs of India on International fora? No one makes hue and cry when France fights radical terrorism but creates so much panic and tension when India does something which is solely and wholly an internal matter of India.”

Tehmeena Syed, a women rights’ activist from Kashmir said, “I’m coming from a world which is known as paradise.” She added that this “paradise” was destroyed by the insurgencies, and “the abrogation of Article 370 was undeniable need of the hour to get rid of cross-border terrorism and insurgencies in Kashmir”. Brian Toll, expert on South Asia from European Commission and Paulo Casaca, executive director, South Asia Democratic Forum, said after the decades of ongoing instability and terrorist incidents in J&K, the Indian government abrogated Article 370 to bring peace and prosperity in the region. President of Gilgit Baltistan Studies, Senge Sering, supported India’s decision on acting against the factors that destabilise Jammu and Kashmir.

344,['4/03/2020'],AMC launches mega drive against illegal hoardings after HC order,"Aurangabad: A day after the Aurangabad Bench of the Bombay High Court issued directives to the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) commissioner to remove illegal hoardings in the city, the civic body has initiated a drive on Tuesday.

The drive that began from the market areas of Gulmandi was extended to all parts of the city.

The order in this regard was issued by the court on Monday. The bench comprising justice ZA Haq and justice SM Gavhane had asked the municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey to file an affidavit in the court stating as to how many illegal hoardings are removed till March 5.

The affidavit should contain details about the losses caused to the civic body by those whose illegal hoardings will be removed over the three day period and the amount spent for the removal of the hoardings, the order states. If the affidavit is not filed before 10.30am on March 6, the municipal commissioner should remain present before the court, the order adds.

The order was issued during the hearing of a 2013 intervention application filed by NGO Jagruti Mahila Manch Bahuddeshiya Sanstha in 2011 suo-moto Public Interest Litigation (PIL) against illegal hoardings in the city.

Subsequently, the civic body started its drive against illegal hoardings, banners, flexes in all areas of the city on the direction of Pandey. The drive started from Gulmandi and Paithan Gate where big and small hoardings of political figures, commercial advertisements and others were removed. Simultaneously, the drive was carried out in different areas of the city. The drive continued from 10 am to 5 pm. The Civic officials said that the drive will continue over the coming days.

AMC under fire for Swachh Bharat hoardings

In a failure to set an example for putting up hoardings according to rules, the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has put up ‘Swachh Bharat’ hoardings on roadsides and squares in different parts of the city, including the irrigation office on Jalna Road and TV Centre. When asked, mayor Nandkumar Ghodele said that municipal corporation should be setting an example in the matter, adding that orders have already been issued for the removal of hoardings.

345,['4/03/2020'],Gondia govt hosp ‘borrows’ 21 teachers from city GMCs,"Nagpur: The state directorate for medical education and research (DMER) has ordered two government medical colleges (GMCs) in the city to relieve 21 academicians — professors, associate professors and assistant professors — immediately and directed them to join government medical college hospital (GMCH) in Gondia.

As per the DMER order, these teachers will be posted in Gondia on ‘deputation’ to cover-up more than 20% deficiency of faculty in the college. According to MCI rules, if the faculty deficiency is more than 20% in an institute, then it is not considered for the renewal of admissions. Thus, the DMER did the patchwork so that Gondia GMCH would not lose its 100 MBBS first year seats for the year 2020-21. The college is scheduled to face a compliance inspection of the MCI in a few days.

Director of DMER, Dr TP Lahane, said that the teachers have been transferred on deputation only from those departments that have enough number of faculties.

“We can’t lose 100 MBBS seats of Gondia GMCH just like that. It’s a responsibility of all academicians to accept postings on deputation and work in Gondia during this period. It’s a temporary arrangement and teachers will be brought back when others will be available,” he said adding that those who refuse these deputation orders will face action.

Generally, such midterm transfers, effected in view of upcoming MCI inspection, are temporary. Even DMER order has clear mention that salaries and allowances of these teachers will be paid by their original institutions only. Earlier too, similar arrangement was done in 2017 and 2018.

The list of teachers transferred include 19 academicians from GMCH and two from IGGMCH. Following DMER order, both medical colleges have issued office orders to their respective professors to join Gondia GMCH by handing over charge to the seniors. Out of 19 names of GMCH, the dean has issued transfer orders to 17 teachers. Orders for others will be issued soon.

DMER’s PATCHWORK

Four-year-old Gondia GMCH received show cause notice from MCI on February 17

MCI found 29 major flaws during physical and academic inspection of the college

College is facing 20.75% deficiency of faculty and 46.77% deficiency of residents

According to MCI, such institute is not considered for renewal of admissions

Fearing loss of renewal of 100 MBBS seats, DMER swung into action on February 27

21 teachers from GMCH and IGGMCH in Nagpur were ordered to join Gondia GMCH

Order reads that this arrangement is only for MCI inspection

Mangaluru: Students from Welcomgroup Graduate School of Hotel Administration (WGSHA, Manipal), are working on the commercial launch of ‘Jackwurst- better off the meat curse’. There is an increase in the number of people cutting down on meat/ dairy and going vegan. This has inspired a group of five students to experiment on sausages from raw jackfruit .

Sanjana Apte, final year degree student at WGSHA, said their aim is to work on a product that is unique and has a universal appeal. “Raw jackfruit is a popular food used extensively by generations owing to its health benefits. Since jackfruit is a superfood and a lot of people are going vegetarian these days, we decided to develop a unique dish. Researchers worldwide are exploring its health benefits. So far, not many chefs have experimented with jackfruit sausages in India,” she claimed.

The team of Sanjana, Sahil Joshi, Shaun D’Silva, Noah George and Pradyumn Nayak is mentored by chefs Dayanand Prabhu and Partho Pratham Seal, and supported by their HoD, chef Vasanthan Sigamany, and principal, chef Thirugnanasambantham.

Speaking on the sausage recipe, Sanjana said the star of the dish is raw jackfruit and vital wheat gluten powder. Raw jackfruit is cured with lemon juice, steamed and ingredients are added to it. The team has used cellulose casing. “The dish has received positive reviews and we will soon be sending the samples to the microbiology lab and discuss ways to increase its shelf life and to assess its nutritional value. Trials are happening simultaneously. In about two months, we are hoping to launch the product commercially,” she added.

Jackwurst received special mention at the innovation festival of Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE) that concluded on Saturday.

Gittikhadan police, under senior PI Sunil Gangurde, have registered a case of murder against the accused, Lucky, following a complaint from his mother Sarita. They also arrested Lucky within an hour after the incident came to light.

According to police, Lucky used to live with his parents, a younger sister and his grandmother. The sister wanted to get married with a man and entire family was ready for the match, except Lucky. On Sunday, a major fight broke out at the house over marriage proposal.

Police said even earlier Lucky, who worked at a vegetable shop, used to beat up his sister as he did not like her talking with another person. Following the fight, Sarita and her daughter left the house and went to a relative’s house. On Monday night, Lucky came home drunk when Raulabai was alone.

Raulabai tried to talk to him about his sister’s wedding. However, Lucky got angry and began a quarrel with his grandmother. In a fit of anger, Lucky brought a big stone from the outside and smashed Raulabai’s head with it.

The neighbours heard the ruckus and called police control room. Gittikhadan police rushed to the spot and arrested Lucky who was standing among the crowd. Cops sent the body of Raulabai to Mayo hospital where post mortem was conducted on Tuesday and the body was handed over to family members.

Police have also seized the stone used in the crime from the spot. Lucky was produced before a court on Tuesday and sent to police custody till February 6.

Sources said the Raulabai had taken care of Lucky and his sister since they were children.

349,['4/03/2020'],Gold coins recovered from Trichy temple date to 18th Century,"The coins were unearthed from a depth of about 7 feet during restoration work at the Akilandeswari Jambukeswar... Read More

TRICHY: The treasure trove of 505 gold coins depicting Hindu deities and Persian letters unearthed last week from a temple in Trichy dates to the 18th Century of Hyder Ali’s rule in the kingdom of Mysore. While it was speculated to be from the Chola period, state archaeology department officials said the hundial unearthed had four different types of gold coins, all belonging to 18th century.

The coins were unearthed from a depth of about 7 feet during restoration work at the Akilandeswari Jambukeswarar temple in Thiruvanaikaval. T Thangadurai, archaeological officer, department of archaeology, who studied the coins, has submitted a report to T Udhayachandran, principal secretary and commissioner, on the findings.

‘Dutch Pagoda’ (Varahan), also known as Pagoda, a unit of currency, was one type of coins recovered from the hundial. Thangadurai said there were a total of 493 of them depicting the deity Vishnu on one side and random dots on the other. Besides this, Star Pagoda coins (10 numbers), also known as British pagoda, were in the hundial released by Britishers. They depicted a half-figure of Vishnu on one side and a star symbol on the other, he said.

‘Hyder Ali 4 pagoda’ was the rare finding among other coins in the hundial, said A Seetharaman, a noted numismatist in Thanjavur. He said only one Hyder Ali 4 pagoda coin was found in the hundial which cannot be found even in Mysore. Weighing about 10-11 grams, it has Hyder Ali’s name on both sides in Persian. Unlike the other coins, the market value of this one could be more than Rs 1 lakh. Another type of coin was ‘Hyder Ali 1 Pagoda’ depicting Siva-Parvathi in seating position and his name on the other side. One such coin weighing about 3-3.5 grams was recovered from the hundial, he said. Author of 33 books on numismatics, Seetharaman said that similar hundials have been used right from Chola period but this one belongs to 18th century.

Asked how coins with Hindu deity were brought out by a Muslim ruler, Thangadurai said they were released as a continuation from the Arcot Nawab in 16th century and Vijayanagar kingdom of 14th century. It was then a traditional practice to acknowledge the sentiments of Hindus.

However, Thangadurai said it is difficult to conclude as to how these coins were buried in this place. Unlike an archaeological excavation where related evidence will be available, the place where the coins were found would have been dug up on several occasions. These coins will be kept in the government museum in Chennai for display after the museum department takes their custody under Indian Treasure Trove Act, 1878.

351,['4/03/2020'],"After students raise issue, NU says reval fee refund from summer","Nagpur: A day after a group of students led by Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) included refund of revaluation fee in their list of demands, Nagpur University (NU) announced that a decision would be taken soon on the issue. This is perhaps the first time a students group has included the demand in its memorandum.

Vice-chancellor SP Kane told TOI, “The modalities have been completed and the scheme would be started from this summer exam. Students will get forms having relevant columns for the refund. Those who have paid the fee since 2016 too would be eligible for refunds.”

Though the announcement was made in 2016, the scheme never saw the light of the day as NU did little to initiate the process or create awareness about the issue. Since NU never issued any communication in this regard, students were unaware of the decision.

Of late, several queries were posed by Senate members and media too raised the issue. Some students decided to include it in their list of demands and submit it to the VC. Kane assured them that the facility will be made available to not just them but also those from 2016 onwards.

TOI had reported about the VC’s move in January. But NU refused to divulge any information about it during last Friday’s Senate meeting.

Acting Pro-VC Vinayak Deshpande said the committee set up to study the issue submitted its report recently and therefore queries regarding it were not entertained. The committee led by the Pro-VC comprised registrar, finance and accounts officer, and director of examinations and evaluation.

“The report would be put before the management council. A finance committee too has been formed as the move will result in loss of revenue. Unless sanctioned by the council and the finance section, the scheme can’t be implemented,” Deshpande said.

The acting Pro-VC said as per the panel’s recommendation the change in marks has to be more than 5%. Earlier it was 10%. The panel has also recommended deduction of 25% as administrative expenses, which means eligible students are likely to get around 75% refund of the revaluation fee.

There is also some confusion regarding the period of implementation. The panel hasn’t recommended retrospective implementation while the VC has been assuring that it will be done from 2016 onwards.

“Ultimately, it will be the management council and VC’s decision. The report is not final,” Deshpande said.

352,['4/03/2020'],NMC staffer dismissed in bogus appointments case,"Nagpur: Within a span of 18 days, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has dismissed third employee from service. The latest action is related to bogus appointments scam unearthed in the civic body in 2013.

Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe on Tuesday dismissed Class III employee Jyotsana Bhivgade, working as property tax collector in the NMC’s Mangalwari zone, after departmental inquiry found her guilty in the scam.

An NMC official told TOI that Bhivgade had given fake appointment letters to three persons in 2013. “Bhivgade was working with the NMC’s general administration department (GAD) then. When the three persons reached NMC’s property tax department with the “appointment letters” to join duty, a clerk raised suspicion and alerted property tax superintendent. The superintendent inquired with the GAD only to know that the three appointment letters were fake,” he said.

The matter was reported to Sadar police who had registered a case and arrested Bhivgade and a Class IV employee Sadanand Janbandhu. NMC also initiated department inquiry and the two were suspended.

NMC official added, “Bhivgade and Janbandhu moved court challenging the suspension. As the matter was sub judice, a few years later, Bhivgade and Janbandhu were reinstated. Bhivgade was posted in Mangalwari zone. Recently, district court upheld action against Bhivgade, but gave clean chit to Janbandhu. The departmental probe also found Bhivgade guilty. Accordingly, Mundhe passed the termination order,” he said.

In 2013, it had came to fore that bogus appointment letters were issued to eight persons. Fate of the remaining five could not be known.

353,['4/03/2020'],Close watch of hotspots brings down accident rate in Trichy,"Representative image

Close monitoring of hotspots where frequent road accidents take place has helped bring down accident rate in Trichy range. On analysing the accident data in the five districts for the last five years, police have found that most of the accidents occurred between 3pm and 11pm, and during this period the maximum occurred between 6pm and 8pm.

“The idea is to pick the hottest part of the hotspots, meaning, the hotspot where the accident occurs frequently. The policemen will be posted in the hotspots compulsorily between 6pm and 8pm and it will be monitored by the SPs of each district. The presence of police could send some alertness to the drivers thus preventing accidents,” DIG V Balakrishnan said.

Stating that the practice has been implemented in the five districts in the range for the last three months, the DIG said corrective measures and the progress of the corrective measures will be reviewed with SPs in the weekly meeting.

The police will also take into consideration the new spots where the accidents occur and send an expert team comprising police, motor vehicle inspectors and officials from state and national highways department to analyse the reason.

On the aspect of cooperation from stake holders in taking corrective measures, the DIG said that officials from the highways department were summoned during multiple occasions in Trichy and Pudukottai for not taking corrective measures as suggested by the police.

Trichy SP Zia Ul Haq said that the compliance of the police in the hotspots is being closely monitored and the reserve inspectors in the sub-divisions have been given responsibilities to prevent the accidents in the locations.

355,['4/03/2020'],Students burn Maoist banners blocking road to exam venue,"Gadchiroli: The Maoists on Tuesday got a jolt for the first time from the women community, especially students, as their ‘International women’s day’ banners at Tadgaon in Bhamragarh tehsil of south Gadchiroli, were set afire.

The women and students were angry as the banners and dummy bomb had disrupted vehicular and human traffic at Tadgaon on Bhamragarh-Alapalli Road. This is the road the students were taking to their centres on the first day of their board examination.

The around 90 women and girl students from Tadgaon ashramshala torched the Naxal banners put up on Monday across the road, around a kilometre away from Tadgaon village. In addition, the Maoists had also triggered a fake bomb scare by placing two drums on the road wrapped with banners. They had also attached wires to the drums, making it appear like an Improvised Explosive Device (IED).

Sub-inspector Sameer Dabhade of Tadgaon police station said the dummy bombs were removed by the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad (BDDS) experts. “Once we had cleared the roads, the villagers took away the two banners put up by the Maoists. The banners were set on fire at the main chowk of the village (Tadgaon), mostly by women,” he said.

Dabhade also said the women wanted to take the lead as they were the most upset with the reds jeopardizing the examination. Police ensured the exams took place without any hiccups.

SP Shailesh Balkawade said more women are coming out against the Maoists. “Women have started showing great faith on police machinery and shunning the Maoists. Last year, 12,000 women and girl students joined the human chain in the district against Maoist violence,” he said, reacting to the women taking lead to destroy the Maoist banners.

Apart from an appeal to celebrate International Women’s Day on March 8 against atrocities on them, the Maoists had also urged tribals to burn effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray and others, holding them responsible for the spurt in crime against the fairer sex. The banners were put up by Perimili Area Committee.

Police said the anger against Maoists stemmed from the fact that reds have so far eliminated 22 women in the district on various pretexts, mostly by labelling them as police informers. The murder of Bebi Madavi, an educated tribal and job aspirant, by Maoists had drawn widespread flak last year.

356,['4/03/2020'],Anti-encroachment drive at Kumbharwada,"Aurangabad: An internal road in the Kumbharwada market area saw its first anti-encroachment drive by Aurangabad Municipal Corporation ( AMC ) on Tuesday under the guidance of municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey.

Traders in the area had extended their shops to the roads, reducing the width of the road to half.

Incidentally, the traders in the Paithan Gate and Gulmandi areas had met Pandey last week demanding removal of hawkers from the said areas. The shopkeepers said that the hawkers conducting business in the areas cause obstruction to the traffic movement and prevent the entry of customers into their shops.

Later, the hawkers also stormed the AMC office asking the allocation of hawkers’ zone according to Street Vendors Act 2014. Subsequently, a delegation of traders had invited municipal commissioner to Paithan Gate on Monday to resolve the issue of hawkers.

While surveying the area, a trader told Pandey about the extensions made by shopkeepers in the Kumbharwada area. The Kumbharwada market, which is several decades old, has never seen an encroachment removal drive according to the locals. The market is flooded with customers all year long and, during festivals, there is hardly any space for movement. Shops selling women’s clothes, accessories, beauty products and household products had raised structures in front of their shops to display their products and to attract customers.

Deputy municipal commissioner Ravindra Nikam, who heads the anti-enrcroachment department, told Pandey that the structures were illegally erected over the carriageway and that several notices have been issued to the shopkeepers to remove them. Subsequently, Pandey directed the removal of the structures and the action was immediately started with the help of mechanical excavators.

Commissioner of police Chiranjeev Prasad was also present at the spot. According to AMC, 124 to 150 encroachments were removed on Gulmandi to Kumbharwada Road, Rangargalli to City Chowk Road, Gulmandi to Paithan Gate Road. The anti-encroachment drive began at 10.30 am and continued till 5 pm.

Her father lodged a complaint of deception against the boy with Chandur Railway police, who have registered a case of the girl going missing.

Sources said the girl was a resident of Yadav Nagar in Chandur Railway town and studying in BA-II at Mahila Kala Va Vanijya Mahavidyalaya.

The college had been at the centre of controversy on February 23, when two lecturers administered an oath to all the girls at a special National Social Service (NSS) camp at village Tembhurni. The oath was to the effect that the girls would not indulge in love affairs or love marriage. The eloped girl too had taken the oath, it is learnt.

The oath had evoked sharp reactions from all corners of the state. After a probe, the college management had suspended the principal who had proposed the oath, and the two lecturers who implemented the idea at the camp. It is learnt that the students had recently launched an agitation to demand withdrawal of suspension of the teachers.

Even before the ink on the matter dried, this girl eloped with her boyfriend from village Baral, taluka Babhulgaon, and married him at a temple on February 29. The news created sensation in Chandur town.

The complaint lodged with police by the girl’s father said she left home in the morning telling parents that she was going to college. In the evening, she called up her father and told him that she had got married to her boyfriend. She also claimed that her boyfriend owns a two-storeyed house at his native place and two flats at Pune. She asked her father not to worry about her.

When the father made enquiries, he reportedly found that the boy’s claims were not borne out. So, he lodged a complaint with police that the girl had been deceived by the boy. The cops are searching for the girl.

359,['4/03/2020'],"1st in Maha, Nagzira &amp; Koka to get e-eyes for 24X7 surveillance","Nagpur: The Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR) in Gondia and Bhandara districts will get a Rs7.5 crore e-surveillance and anti-poaching system. This will be the first such project in the state on the lines of Rajasthan.

The 656sqkm NNTR is spread in five blocks. While Nagzira, New Nagzira and Koka wildlife sanctuaries are connected, roads, highways and railway line separate New Navegaon sanctuary and Navegaon national park from the three protected areas (PAs).

The technology-enabled surveillance system will help improve forest department’s monitoring mechanism for conserving tiger and other wildlife species.

“The hi-tech system will capture any movement of humans as well animals from over 500 metres while the cameras can be moved 360 degrees,” said officials.

State’s PCCF (wildlife) Nitin H Kakodkar said, “A Rs20 crore e-surveillance proposal was sent to the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) last year for three areas namely Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR), NNTR and Bramhapuri. The project will be funded by the NTCA and state on 60:40 basis.”

“The approval has come for NNTR. A survey has been conducted last week by the team that installed the system in Rajasthan and places have been identified. A request for proposal (RFP) will be the next step followed by floating of tenders,” said Kakodkar.

NNTR field director M Ramanujam said, “Of the two identified spots to install towers, one will be in Koka wildlife sanctuary and another in Nagzira. Both are at two ends of the sanctuary. The cutting-edge thermographic cameras with remote zoom capabilities will ensure effective monitoring, identification of poachers, check on infiltration, illegal mining and grazing and will help retrieve fact-based information for effective decision-making.”

“These cameras will also keep an eye on movement of wildlife species in highly sensitive zones and poaching-prone areas. Along with this, motion detection video and other required analytics tool have also been deployed,” Ramanujam added.

In Rajasthan, the system has been installed in Ranthambore, Sariska, Mukandara Hills, Jawaibandh (Pali) leopard conservation reserve and Jhanana nature park in Jaipur.

Commenting on the success of the system, Rajasthan’s PCCF (HoFF) GV Reddy was cautious. “There are limitations to the system if it doesn’t cover 100% area. It is partially successful. The reason being that there was requirement of 20 towers to cover the entire area, but only 10-11 were installed.”

“The success of e-surveillance depends on the extent of area where the cameras are being installed. If you stitch from the front and leave the back open, then it is not going to help. It’s better to cover one area 100% if good results are to be achieved. The state spent Rs40 crore on the entire project, but only 40% area is being covered,” said Reddy.

“The team from Maharashtra should visit Rajasthan before executing the project. We will be happy to showcase the project and share our nitty-gritties about the e-surveillance project,” the Rajasthan PCCF added.

How It Works

* With over 150 villages in NNTR buffer, there is huge biotic and poaching pressure on NNTR

* To curb tiger poaching and other anti-wildlife activities, thermal cameras will be installed with drones and advanced anti-poaching surveillance mechanism

* This will be first ever 24X7 surveillance & anti-poaching system in Maharashtra

* Two towers will be set up in Nagzira and Koka. These will be connected to control rooms

* Control rooms will be connected to each camera which will alert officials in case of any incident

* The system will also provide various reports to analyse movement pattern of wildlife species

* It will ensure effective monitoring, identification of poachers, check on infiltration, illegal mining etc

* The cameras will provide a live feed of wildlife movements and other activities in the covered area

* With use of integrated UAVs, wildlife monitoring, boundary monitoring, anti-poaching and anti-theft operations will be conducted

Dhage has also demanded that a third party audit should be carried out to check the quality of roads being constructed.

Meanwhile, PWD assistant engineer Syed K has denied the allegations and said that Dhage has vested interests owing to which he has made the complaint.

The work of internal road at the GMCH started in November last year and the state government has given an administrative approval of Rs 2.78 crore for it.

Under the project, the main road from GMCH’s entry gate to the end of Makai Gate and the road from medical superintendent’s office to the mortuary are being built with cement and concrete, while bitumen is being used for other branching roads.

According to the letter sent by Dhage to the chief engineer, the quality of road being constructed is of poor and the project lacks planning.

Dhage has alleged that PWD officials are also not present at the site and the work is not being carried out as per terms and conditions listed in the tender. The MIM group leader in the AMC has also raised questions on the quality of material used for road work. He has subsequently demanded that the payment for the work should be released only after the third party audit is carried out.

“When we did not entertain Dhage’s interests he has started making baseless allegations. I am present on the site monitoring the work at all times,” Syed said.

He added that several people, including members of the MIM, have appreciated the quality of road work and if needed a third party audit can be carried out to verify the quality of work.

Enforcement of traffic rules by the police has helped bring down the number of fatalities by 20% in Trichy range in the last two months, compared to the same period last year. The number of deaths has come down to 115 in Trichy range comprising Trichy, Pudukottai , Karur and Ariyalur, except for Perambalur where the fatality has gone up. During the same period last year, 144 deaths in road accidents were reported in the five districts.

Trichy range DIG V Balakrishnan listed out a slew of measures taken in the last few months that helped the police save the lives of injured road accident victims which included displaying contact numbers of ambulance on walls or flex boards, first aid training to people and auto-rickshaw drivers in the accident prone areas, awareness on accidents and consequences, felicitating Good Samaritans for providing assistance to accident victims within the golden hour besides imposing fines on helmet and seatbelt violators.

“Going by the data, a major cause of the fatality remains unsafe travel without helmet on bikes and not wearing seatbelts in the four-wheelers. Our objective is to bring down the fatalities. We focussed on intensifying the enforcement on these aspects. It paid off as the measures has resulted in bringing down fatalities,” DIG Balakrishnan told TOI on Tuesday.

The police believed that the enforcement against the over speeding, red light jumping, driving or riding while using mobile phone, drunken driving, overloading in goods carriers and carrying passengers in goods carriers will reduce the number of accidents. The rate of enforcement also increased manifold in all the five districts in the past two months.

In the last two months, enforcement has been high in all the five districts. Perambalur is the only district where the fatality count has not come down but shot upwards by 34 deaths, while last year it was only 10.

DIG Balakrishnan pointed out that one of the main reasons for increasing number of fatalities in Perambalur was due to the national highway passing through the district. “Our team is working to fix it in Perambalur,” he said.

Trichy road safety council member M Sekaran was of the view that the human errors caused the accidents leading to fatalities.

“Human errors are the major reason for accidents. Besides creating awareness directly to the public apart from emotional binding with their children in road safety clubs in education institution. When a daughter or son ask his father to wear helmet to save his life, it will touch his heart and mind, thus it will create a good impact,” he said.

The mayor has promised to look into their demands and to everything in his capacity to help them.

According Maharashtra Rajya Veej Tantrik Kamgar Sanghatna — a state-level union of technical workers of the state power utility — there are around 2,500 technical operators working for the power distribution company.

In a decision taken at the regional level, the overtime payment for these workers has been stopped for the last two years. Syed Zaheeruddin, deputy general secretary of the union, said the technical operators in Nagpur, Pune and Kalyan continue to receive overtime payment. The union has also submitted a memorandum of demands to the senior MSECL officials.

“In addition, while 117% recovery has been registered in Aurangabad region, the regional office has penalised 45 employees of the recovery staff with fines ranging between Rs 2,000 and Rs 5,000 for failing to recover dues from consumers. The work of recovery is not easy and in such situation, the MSEDCL should not punish its staff,” Zaheeruddin said.

“Four years ago, an experiment was carried out to rope in a private agency for distribution of electricity, but that resulted in heavy losses for the MSEDCL. Therefore, we are against privatisation,” he added.

Meanwhile, Ghodele said being the first citizen of Aurangabad he is aware of the problems of the electricity employees. He has assured the MSEDCL employees that he will lead a delegation of local public representatives and raise the issue with state energy minister Nitin Raut.

The attack left his wife injured. Police said the miscreants targeted the shop run by A Somasundaram, 58, of Thirupaigneeli, who is also the vice-chairman of a cooperative society. The attack took place on Monday night when Somasundaram and his wife Pushpa were at the shop.

Police said two men on a bike arrived at the shop and threw an explosive at the shop. The following explosion broke the glass of a showcase at the shop, leaving Pushpa injured. She was taken to a government hospital last night and was discharged later. The Mannachanallur police carried out an enquiry with Somasundaram. Police said that the accused had covered their faces with handkerchiefs. The attack seemed to be an attempt only to threaten Somasundram given the low intensity of the bomb, police said adding the motive of the incident is yet to be ascertained.

However, police are investigating whether it was born out of an enmity with him after he contested local body elections. The Mannachanallur police registered a case.

368,['4/03/2020'],AAP activists booked for violating prohibitory orders for membership drive,"Picture for representational purpose only.

AURANGABAD: The Cidco police have booked the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) office-bearers on Monday for violating prohibitory orders by carrying out the party’s membership drive at a public place without due permission.

The police have defended their action by saying that the prohibitory orders are aimed at ensuring peace in the city.

In the FIR registered, the police mentioned that AAP was denied permission to hold a public event, but the party went ahead and held its membership drive anyway. Based on the complaint lodged by head constable Gokul Lodhwal, an offence has been registered under IPC section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant). Moreover, section 135 of the Maharashtra Police Act has also been slapped.

Officers said the city police chief had imposed a ban on gatherings of more than four people at a place without prior permission. AAP office-bearers allegedly violated the orders, forcing the police to register an offence against them.

“Delhi violence, the ongoing SSC and HSC exams, and the political parties going all out while preparing for municipal elections are the key reasons for imposing of prohibitory orders in the city,” revealed a police officer.

The party, meanwhile, has refuted the allegations and accused the police of partisan approach. AAP’s Marathwada convenor Sugriv Mundhe, who has also been named in the FIR, told TOI: “First we had sought permission to hold a membership drive at N-6 Cidco-based ground. The police denied us permission, so we asked the party workers to turn up at the office. Moreover, there was no written reply from the police denying us permission.”

AAP workers on Sunday evening gathered at the party office located at the Hindu Rashtra Chowk in N-7 Cidco of New Aurangabad . Mundhe said the police cannot stop the party workers from turning up at its office. “On Sunday, BJP state president too was in the town and that party too held a public event. Why has no offence been registered against them?” asked Mundhe.

An offence under section 188 of the IPC is bailable and liable to be investigated and decided by the magistrate, who has the authority over the area where such offence has been committed.

369,['4/03/2020'],"Now, you can sail from M’luru to Lakshadweep","Ready to sail: The MV Minicoy

Vinobha.KT

Mangaluru: The Lakshadweep administration is all set to resume operations of a passenger ship from Mangaluru to the island on Wednesday. People from Mangaluru can travel to Lakshadweep from the Old Port in the city, instead of taking the Kochi route. Currently, Lakshadweep can be reached by ships and flights operated from Kochi. For all tourist purposes, Kochi is the gateway to Lakshadweep. The resumption of ship service from Mangaluru is expected to boost island tourism in Lakshadweep.

All one needs to do to go to Lakshadweep is to get a letter from a resident on the island, sponsoring them, and book a ticket from the counter at Bunder.

The vessel MV Minicoy will start sailing from Mangaluru Old Port at 1pm on Wednesday, and will reach approximately the next morning. The entry to Lakshadweep islands is restricted. One requires an entry permit issued by the Lakshadweep administration to visit these islands, apart from a resident sponsoring the visitor. The sponsor will get the papers cleared through the administration in Lakshadweep. Later, the ticket can be booked by using a valid identity card. A similar passenger service was launched from Mangaluru Old Port earlier too, but was stopped a few years ago. There are tourism agencies that offer packages which include visits to various tourism spots and stay on the islands, said a source.

Gulam Mohammed, welfare officer of the ship, said that boarding the ship will start at 10am on Wednesday. “The ship will start sailing at 1pm. It has 150 seats and the fare is Rs 200 per head,” he said.

Dakshina Kannada Coastal Regulation Zone Management Committee had granted a no objection certificate to the Lakshadweep administration for the construction of their office and other amenities at Bunder in 2015. The Lakshadweep administration and the Karnataka port department had prepared a plan to construct a harbour, passengers’ waiting complex, goods sheds and other facilities at a cost of Rs 50 crore. The port department also agreed to provide 8,000sqm land to the Lakshadweep administration for the purpose. However, the project has not yet been taken up.

372,['4/03/2020'],‘Riot instigators mustn’t be spared’,"It was the first meeting between the two leaders after the recent assembly polls (PTI photo)

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday where the two leaders discussed the recent riots in northeast Delhi and the current situation in the area.

It was the first meeting between the two leaders after the recent assembly polls which saw Aam Aadmi Party winning 62 of the 70 seats and forming the government in the national capital for the third time. BJP emerged victorious in the remaining eight constituencies.

The meeting was held at the Prime Minister’s office in Parliament and lasted about 30 minutes.

On February 25, Kejriwal along with the functionaries of other political parties had met Union home minister Amit Shah to discuss the situation in Delhi.

After meeting the Prime Minister, Kejriwal said he demanded stern action against those who instigated the riots. “Whoever was responsible for the riots, irrespective of party, religion or stature, should not be spared. Strict action should be taken against them so that a message that such actions will not be tolerated goes out to the public,” Kejriwal added.

At least 47 people were killed and more than 400 injured in one of the worst communal riots in the capital after 1984.

The chief minister also said that several lives could have been saved had the police worked “proactively” last week in northeast Delhi.

He, however, appreciated the police for its “prompt response” on Sunday in checking the “rumours” of riots in West Delhi. He asserted that such promptness of Delhi Police during the riots last week would have saved many lives.

“There were rumours of riots on Sunday, which led to a panic situation across the city. Delhi Police played a very good role in curbing the rumours and its role was really commendable,” Kejriwal said.

He added that the two leaders agreed on working together to prevent such situations to recur in future. “We will take whatever steps needed to be taken to prevent such riots,” a Delhi government statement quoted Kejriwal as saying after the meeting.

Kejriwal also said the Prime Minister assured him of cooperation for the development of Delhi for the next five years.

NEW DELHI: A day after his tweet hinting at the possibility of giving up his social media accounts, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday ended speculation, saying his accounts on Twitter , Facebook , Instagram and YouTube will be handled by “women who inspire us” on Women’s Day on March 8.

“This Women's Day (March 8), I will give away my social media accounts to women whose life & work inspire us. This will help them ignite motivation in millions. Are you such a woman or do you know such inspiring women? Share such stories using #SheInspiresUs,” Modi tweeted, sharing the hashtag so that women could share their stories and take part in the campaign.

The accounts will run by the selected women for a day, though there could be several women involved. “It need not be one person running one channel. There is no limit,” said a source. Given Modi’s presence on social media, his accounts are likely to get widespread attention on the day.

With hashtag “SheInspiresUs”, Modi asked, “Your chance to take-over Narendra Modi’s social media accounts for a day! Are you a woman whose life and work can inspire the world? Do you know inspiring women who have made a difference in their spheres of life?”

Following this PM offered, “Tweets or post it on twitter/FB/instagram using “SheInspiresUs. You can also shoot a video and post it on youtube ... select entries get a chance to take over Narendra Modi’s social media accounts and share their thoughts & ideas with the world.”

Modi sent the social media abuzz with his tweet on Monday, “This Sunday, thinking of giving up my social media accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram & YouTube. Will keep you all posted.”

While some wondered whether his quitting had anything to do with the menace of fake news, others surmised that India might launch a China-type indigenous social media platform. Modi is one of the most-followed world leaders on social media with 53.3 million followers on Twitter, 44 million on Facebook and 35.2 million on Instagram. The Twitter handle of the Prime Minister's Office has 32 million followers.

In September 2019, Modi was the third-most followed world leader on the microblogging site, behind only US President Donald Trump and his predecessor Barack Obama . The Prime Minister was the first Indian to cross the 50-million followers mark on Twitter.

MADURAI: Madras high court on Tuesday appointed an advocate commissioner to carryout inspection and submit a report while hearing a plea which sought to prevent illegal sand mining from the Vaigai riverbed from a village in Dindigul district .

V Manikandan, a resident of Madurai , in his petition stated that the authorities had granted permission to a person for quarrying rough stone in a few survey numbers of land at Rengappanaickenpatti village in Dindigul district.

MADURAI: The central government has been directed to respond to a plea which sought to release funds for two Harijan Sevak Sangh (HSS) schools functioning in the state.

The court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by S Muthuselvam, a law student in Madurai. In his plea, Muthuselvam stated that Harijan Sevak Sangh was founded by Mahatma Gandhi in 1932 to eradicate prevalence of untouchability and for the upliftment of scheduled caste and downtrodden people.

He said there are two HSS schools in Tamil Nadu - N M R Subbaraman Memorial Residential Primary School in Madurai which was established in 1979 and a residential middle school at Thirukoilur in Villupuram district (now in Kallakurichi district ), which was established in 1993. He stated that funds had not been allotted to these schools for the past three years.

He said that a news item published in The Times of India on October 5, 2019 mentioned that the Union social justice and empowerment ministry has not released funds for HSS for the past three financial years. If funds are not released, then these schools may close down.

Muthuselvam said that since Right to Education is a fundamental right guaranteed under the Constitution, the ministry is duty bound to release funds every year for the effective functioning of these schools. Hence, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench seeking funds for these schools.

A division bench of justice P N Prakash and justice B Pugalendhi observed that it was a sad case as funds were not allotted to an institution which was started for the upliftment of people belonging to the scheduled caste community. The judges observed that though funds had not been allotted for the past three years, both these schools had note suffered closure thanks to Good Samaritans.

Assistant solicitor general V Kathirvelu informed the court that he would get instructions from the central government with regard to release of funds and sought time for the same.

Taking cognisance of the submissions, the judges adjourned the case to March 10 for further hearing.

In the order issued on Tuesday, education director Vandana Rao stated that Jalmi has violated the code of conduct for employees of government-aided schools, and directed the managing committee of the Swami Vivekanand Vidya Prasarak Mandal’s higher secondary school to act within three days and submit a compliance report.

“Ramkrishna Jalmi has violated the code of conduct under Rule 100 (ii), (xiv), (xvii) under the Goa School Education Rules, 1986, and also Section 12(2)(b) of the Goa School Education Act, 1984,” said Rao.

The state education rules state that an employee of a recognised school should not ‘propagate through his teaching lessons or otherwise communal or sectarian outlook’. The employee should not ‘practice, or incite any student to practice casteism, communalism or untouchability’ or be ‘guilty of, or encourage, violence, or any conduct which involves moral turpitude’.

“As your institution is an aided institution, the Goa School Education Act, 1984, and Rules 1986 are applicable to every employee and they are liable for disciplinary action for the breach of provision of the code of conduct,” Rao said.

A police complaint was filed against Jalmi for his derogatory remarks against Lord Parshuram and Goa police arrested him Section 295(A) and 153(A) of Indian Penal Code. He is currently out on bail.

The incident occurred during the maths paper on Tuesday. Some students said they had to wait for over 20 minutes before the additional sheets and graph papers were distributed.

“The invigilators were not ready with the papers. Even when they started distributing, they gave it to students of their own schools first. My son got the additional sheets just 10 minutes ahead of the last bell after asking for at least five times. He had at least half an hours’ paper left to write. He could not answer questions worth 20 marks,” said an anxious parent.

“This is extremely disappointing for students who prepared for an entire year for the exams. The authorities should look at CCTV footages and take necessary steps to give the students justice so that they continue to be motivated for the rest of the exams,” said a parent whose son could not attempt questions of six marks.

While the parents wrote to the principal seeking action, she has replied stating, “We will report your concern to the examination zone convener immediately. We are also hopeful that students will continue to be motivated in spite of the incident. We will certainly take care as much as possible of our children.”

Students’ interest will be upheld

The incident has been reported to the Zonal Convenor. The Examination Convener’s team will conduct a preliminary probe and they will inform the Council also. In all such matters, the best interests of the students are always upheld. I am hopeful about it.

A division bench of justice S S Sundar and justice C Saravanan passed the order while hearing a batch of petitions challenging the rejection of nominations of candidates who filed their nominations for 17 posts of board of directors to the union.

The election was notified after the state election commissioner of Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies issued the schedule. Of the total 17 posts, nine were reserved for general category, five for women and three for SC/ST category.

The petitioners contended that though several candidates filed their nominations, the applications of 13 candidates who were favoured were accepted and the remaining were rejected during the scrutiny process on February 28. Without even giving any reasons for rejection, the election officer had declared all 13 candidates as elected unopposed on February 29. The election officer also announced that election would be held for the remaining four posts on March 4.

Since the petitioners stated that the election process was conducted in a biased manner, they moved the court seeking to conduct a fresh election by appointing an observer. Denying these allegations, the state government submitted that the process of scrutiny was conducted in a fair manner. After elaborately hearing the submissions of the state government and the petitioners, the judges also reviewed the video footage of scrutiny process inside the court hall on Tuesday.

Expressing dissatisfaction over the process, the judges granted stay on the election of 11 board of directors who were elected unopposed, as the election of two other board of directors was not challenged. The judges further appointed an advocate as an observer to monitor the election process which is to be conducted for the election to be held on March 4. The judges directed the observer to ensure that the election is conducted in a fair and transparent manner.

381,['4/03/2020'],Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia assures victims of all help,"Manish Sisodia described the violence as the result of the failure of the law and order authorities

NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia met the riot victims of Shiv Vihar on Tuesday and assured them of compensation for loss of property at the earliest. Sisodia described last week’s violence as the result of the “failure of the law and order authorities”.

“Patrolling is going on,” the deputy CM said. “The sub-divisional magistrates are also taking details from the people in localities where violence took place. Even I have come here to see for myself how the people are living and how the compensation effort is proceeding. It is very sad to see the sights in these lanes.”

He commended both the Hindu and Muslim residents of Shiv Vihar for protecting each other’s homes. Sisodia emphasised on confidence building measures. “You can be at peace since police patrolling is going on regularly. Please be assured that the situation is normal,” he said.

One of the houses that Sisodia entered belonged to Nawab Ali, 44, a school cab driver. His two storeyed building was burnt down and his vehicle set ablaze last Tuesday. “Police rescued us late in the day,” he told TOI. He was able to return home only this week.

Several NGO workers and government officials helped people who had lost all documents in fires fill out compensation applications. The officials assured them that the photos of their damaged homes would be enough for them to get their claims. “We have given households the forms, and after complete assessment we will give them the compensation amounts,” said Sisodia, who was accompanied by the legislator from Mustafabad, Haji Yunus, and ACP Brahmjeet Singh.

Yunus, who also visited the Eidgah relief camp, assured the riot victims that they could go back to their homes and that the state government had asked the municipal corporation to clear the roads of rubble. “To claim compensation, people need not give us copies of the FIR,” the minister said. “We are trying to bring back peace as soon as possible so that the people can return to their homes.”

Food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain was also at Brijpuri area to oversee distribution of food by Delhi government. He said, “We are also making sure that people open their shops because this will bring normalcy back in the district.” Kundan, an NGO volunteer, confirmed that the government was collaborating with civil society to ensure expedited delivery of relief material and compensation.

Simultaneously, number of cattle catching squads should be increased to carry out work at war footing, thus ensuring that no valuable human life is lost in future.

LUCKNOW: A 31-year-old trader was killed in a stray bull attack near his home in Balaganj late on Monday night.Neeraj Kashyap is the seventh victim of bovine attack in the city since March 2019 and the third this year. More than two dozen people have also been injured in over 19 such attacks over the past year despite promises to free the capital of stray cattle menace.According to eyewitnesses, Kashyap was returning home after closing his shop around 11pm when the bull knocked him off his bike near a Hanuman temple in Balaganj area. He was rushed to a private hospital with grievous head injuries, but died during treatment.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had, on January 3, 2019, directed civic bodies across the state to put stray cattle in shelters within two months.

383,['4/03/2020'],‘Centre must not give Mhadei nod to K’taka’,"Panaji: A day after the Supreme Court rejected Goa’s plea to stop Karnataka from starting work on the Mhadei, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Tuesday said that in next three days the state government will take action. It will approach the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC), Jal Shakti ministry, and the forest and wildlife board to request them not to grant any permissions to Karnataka to start work on its Mhadei projects.

On Monday, the Supreme Court had rejected Goa’s plea to stop Karnataka from starting work on the Mhadei but said Karnataka can begin construction only after getting permission from the central government and preparation of a detailed project report.

The apex court also said that the 2014 interim order of the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal will remain in force. This effectively means that Karnataka can go ahead with its water diversion projects provided it gets permission from the wildlife board and environment ministry, besides other agencies.

Sawant told reporters, “We will write to all departments concerned whether it is the wildlife board, forest or MoEFCC not to grant no objection certificates (NOC) to start work on the Mhadei.”

He added that Goa has started preparing for the hearing in the Mhadei case which is scheduled for July in the Supreme Court. “During the hearing we will bring all Karnataka’s violation before the SC,” Sawant said.

The tribunal interim order on April 17, 2014, stated that Karnataka cannot start work without a revised DPR which has to be approved by the Union government or the Mhadei Water Management Authority.

However, Karnataka has already got the Centre's nod after Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar in a letter on December 24, 2019, clarified that the neighbouring state doesn't need any environment clearance and requires only wildlife and forest permissions for the Kalasa-Bhandura drinking water project.

After Goa did not object to Karnataka's plea to notify the tribunal August 14, 2018, award, the Supreme Court had directed the Centre to notify it. On February 28 this year, the Centre notified the tribunal’s final award.

But the apex court also said its final verdict would depend on the outcome of the petitions filed by the three riparian states--Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra--the hearing of which has been fixed for July 15, 16 and 22.

387,['4/03/2020'],Stakeholders feel KRCL ignoring state’s interests,"Mangaluru: A sense of disillusionment about Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd (KRCL) fulfilling Karnataka’s needs is growing stronger with each passing day. A good 22 years after KRCL, a joint venture of Railways, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka and Kerala governments was started, people of coastal Karnataka are wondering if the corporation has served the interests of the state, if an RTI reply by the corporation to its plans for Karnataka is anything to go by.

KRCL has not provided stabling or maintenance lines at any of the stations in the 270-km-odd network straddling Karnataka. This has negated chances of any train being started from the coast, other than Mangaluru Central , which is under Southern Railway. KRCL has admitted that it has no plans to construct maintenance lines in the state as per its reply to an RTI query, a copy of which is available with TOI.

Rajeev Gaonkar, vice-president of Karwar-based West Coast Rail Yatri Abhivruddhi Sangha , said out of the nearly 40 trains operating on the Konkan Railway (KR) network through Karnataka, only seven cater to the state, and the rest connect Kerala with north India. “It is unfortunate that Karnataka has to fight for every facility, as KR has been in denial mode,” he said, asserting that people in the state did not part with their land just for the exclusive operation of trains to other states.

While Railways has 52% stake in KRCL, Maharashtra holds 21%, Karnataka 15% and Goa and Kerala have 6% stake each. During the recent Konkan Railway Users Consultative Committee meeting, of which Gaonkar is a member, issues including non-availability of maintenance lines in Karnataka, were raised. Apart from being unable to operate special trains due to lack of infrastructure, KRCL is not accommodating any new train, he said.

When KRCL built maintenance facilities in Goa and Maharashtra, similar facilities were expected in Karnataka too, Gaonkar said, demanding that the corporation build maintenance facilities at Karwar and Ankola or Bhatkal.

Gautam Shetty, a Bengaluru-based train activist, said since KRCL expressed its inability to halt the Bengaluru-Karwar Deepavali special trains that South Western Railway (SWR) operated last year for a couple of days at Karwar, SWR had to run the empty rake back to Bengaluru, incurring huge losses.

On Tuesday, members of National Railway Mazdoor Union ( NRMU ) gheraoed chief medical superintendent (CMS) Dr Sandhya Hedau and protested the apathetic attitude of the railway administration towards 17,000 employees and their family members, who avail services of the hospital.

NRMU divisional secretary SK Jha said, “For the last one year the hospital has not had at least 18 drugs and injections, which went out of stock.”

“The list will be too big if the condition of other hospitals at Ajni, Wardha, Ballarshah, Amla and Junnardeo is considered. The hospital has not completed its annual medical indent (AMI) and pending tenders for 2019-20 have not been finalized,” said Jha.

Jha said there are 343 drugs which are under the purview of CMS, but these medicines are unavailable for the last one month. NRMU has been raising poor plight of the hospital but things have failed to improve.

“The recognized railway union has threatened to launch an agitation if the hospital administration is not improved,” warned NRMU leader Habib Khan.

The accused, who is the son of a BSP politician, had used forged documents to get the job, the hospital authorities had claimed.

Speaking with TOI, Gwalior commissioner MB Ojha, who is also the chairperson of selection committee of medical college autonomous society of Gwalior, said, “Dr Yadav is suspended with the immediate effect and we will also ensure that he is arrested and sent to jail soon.”

When asked, if his registration as doctor would be cancelled, as CBI chargesheet alleged that Dr Yadav had cleared the 2006 pre-medical test with the help of impersonators and middlemen, the commissioner said, “It’s the discretion of the state medical council and Medical Council of India.”

A senior government doctor said, “The dean of Datia government hospital needs to compile a report including evidence such as CBI chargesheet and recommend cancellation of Dr Amit Kumar Yadav’s registration to state medical council as well as MCI.”

When contacted, Dr Rajesh Gaur, the dean of Datia government hospital, said, “We are yet to receive official documents, in which, Dr Yadav has been made prime accused.” However, Dr Gaur added that he had filed false affidavit in 2018 to get the job of assistant professor for forensic medicine.

“In his affidavit, Dr Yadav had mentioned that he was not accused in any FIR related to MP Vyapam scam, which was later found to be untrue,” Dr Gaur said.

CBI lawyer in Gwalior, Vivek Khedkar, confirmed to TOI, “Dr Amit Kumar Yadav is the prime accused in the CBI chargesheet and the court has issued a non-bailable warrant against him, but he is absconding.”

An official source said, “At least five times, Dr Yadav’s bail plea was rejected by various courts, including SC, but he was never arrested. In fact, he continued to work as hospital superintendent and was later made the nodal officer for an upcoming hospital project worth Rs 250 crore.”

Dr Yadav’s father Lakhan Singh Yadav is a well-known contractor who had contested the 2018 assembly polls from Sewda assembly constituency on a BSP ticket. He stood third.

“In April 2018, Dr Yadav was selected by the Datia hospital administration as assistant professor for forensic medicine, even though 10 candidates who appeared for the job interview were way more qualified than him. Dr Yadav did his MD in forensic medicine from a private college,” the source said.

As many as 289, including pre-medical test candidates, their parents, impersonators and middlemen, were named as accused in a supplementary chargesheet filed by the CBI in the Gwalior court in connection with alleged irregularities in the MP Vyapam case in December last year. The chargesheet alleged, that out of the total accused, 41 impersonators and middlemen were from UP, who helped medical aspiring candidates of Madhya Pradesh, clear PMT 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2012.

PANAJI/SALIGAO: A family of four, including two children, was found dead in a flat at Khorlim, Mapusa , on Tuesday. While one person was found hanging in the living room, cops found three bodies lying in the bedroom. Police said that the family, originally from Gadhinglaj in Maharashtra, shifted to Goa four years ago in search of a better life.

Deputy superintendent of police Edwin Colaco said that the deceased have been identified as Shahu Dhumale, 41, who worked as a security supervisor, his wife Kavita, 35, and their sons Paras, 10, and Sairaj, 3. Police said that they haven’t ruled out financial angle behind the deaths. In the flat, the police found Shahu’s diary, in which he wrote a three page-long note about his life. Mapusa police registered a case of unnatural death .

The incident came to light at around 10am. Colaco said that the family was scheduled to shift out of the flat on Tuesday, and Shahu called his brother-in-law for assistance. The owner of the flat was also supposed to drop by to carry out some repair work.

At around 9am, when Shahu’s brother-in-law reached the flat, he knocked and got no response. He then left, assuming that they were sleeping. The owner of the flat also came and he too got no response. A neighbour then showed the owner where the Dhumales usually hung the keys of the flat outside the door. The owner used those keys to open the door, only to find Shahu hanging in the living room.

Police said that the owner then informed the police. When cops reached the site, they found Shahu hanging, and three other bodies in the bedroom. All four bodies were shifted to Goa Medical College for a postmortem examination. Colaco said that there were no external injuries on the bodies of the wife and children.

In his diary, Shahu wrote about how despite his best efforts, he hadn’t become successful, because of which he had to take drastic steps.

Police said that Shahu had purchased the flat but wasn’t in a position to repay the bank loan.Shahu then sold the flat and repaid the loans, cops said.

However, he has mentioned that he was unable to pay a bank loan indicating that he was under pressure due to the mounting debt. There was correspondence between him and the bank, police said. Hence, police are looking at the financial angle leading to the deaths.

As there is no witness in the case, it is not clear what may have really happened and how they died. The police are analysing the material on record and will wait for the post mortem report to piece together the circumstances for clarity in the mysterious death case.

Police said that would call family members of the deceased and question them to find the exact cause of death. Shahu’s sister, who is in Goa, is in a state of shock, police said.

AGRA: People in Range Rovers seldom come to a district government hospital. But Tuesday was different when Covid-19 scare proved to be an equalizer of sorts. Agra leather exporters’ fraternity and their relatives descended on the district hospital premises in their premium SUVs on Tuesday to get themselves screened for coronavirus.

Health department officials tried to calm down the panicking people outside the isolation ward as at least 50 shoe exporters and their family members queued up outside the premises.

A shoe exporter, who had come with his wife and two kids wearing N-95 masks, said “Last month, my family and I had visited Italy to attend a leather trade fair. Following reports of the spread of coronavirus in Italy and now in India, we have come for a medical examination. We have given our blood and throat swab samples for tests. Hospital authorities have told us that the medical report will come after 48 hours.”

Puran Dawar, president of the Agra Footwear Manufacturer and Exporters Chamber (AFMEC), said, “There were four major shoe and leather component trade fairs in Italy from February 17 to 22. Over 45 shoe exporters had gone to attend these fairs. Some of them travelled with their family members and staff. They all returned in the last week of February. Following reports of coronavirus positive cases linked to Italy which were found in India, we have requested all the exporters who have recently visited abroad to get themselves screened. I sent my own son, who was also in Italy recently, to the district hospital. For now, there is nothing to panic. We need to be alert and follow government advisory.”

Satish Verma, superintendent in charge of the district hospital, said, “On Tuesday, we collected nasal, oral and blood samples of 35 people from the leather exporters’ fraternity having foreign travel history. The process will be continued on Wednesday. The samples have been sent to Lucknow and reports are likely to be received between 48 and 72 hours.”

394,['4/03/2020'],"Timely precautions can avert birth defects, say doctors","Representative image

MADURAI: India is the second most populous country to have a large number of infants born with birth defects, which can be prevented through timely precautions. Preconception counselling, discouraging pregnancy after 35 years to minimize chromosomal birth defects, vaccination against viral infections like Rubella and restricting smoking, alcohol and tobacco are some of these preventive methods, says the Birth Defects Registry of India (BDRI).

March 3 is being observed as world birth defects awareness day since 2015 to create awareness on this. BDRI Madurai representative Dr Revathi Janakiram said 1.7 million children are born with birth defects annually. Congenital disorders are also known to be associated with stillbirth and prematurity, which can lead to infant mortality. Increased maternal age at conception was one reason for birth defects in infants. Other causes include chronic medical disorders like diabetes, genetic defects and exposure to teratogens like smoking, alcohol, tobacco, recreational drugs and radiation as well as consanguinity. Maternal deficiencies of folic acid, iodine, macro and micro nutrients could also lead to these defects.

Some medicines consumed for high BP and epilepsy may cause defects in the foetus and the mother should change to safer drugs by consulting a doctor before planning pregnancy. Any medication during pregnancy, especially in the first 12 weeks, must be taken only after consulting the specialist, she said.

Brain growth starts very early and hence starting folic acid at 40 microgram a day at least a month before pregnancy and continuing up to 12 weeks will help prevent neural tube defects. ``In fact it has another name called ‘engagement pill’ as it is recommended that a mother have it from her engagement,’’ she said. Folic acid and B12 prevent up to 70 % cases of neural tube defects like spina bifida, cleft lip and cleft palate.

Santhini (name changed), mother of a 16-year-old boy with down’s syndrome, says she never had counselling when she was pregnant. ``It is heartbreaking to see my son suffer. I would have been grateful if I had the opportunity to put him out of his misery before he was born,’’ she said adding that her son’s birth discouraged her from wanting more children. Head of the department of obstetrics and gynaecology at Government Rajaji Hospital Dr N Sumathy said they were maintaining a registry on birth defects in the hospital. Any mother who shows symptoms of defects in a child is counselled based on the type of anomaly, gestation age and severity.

395,['4/03/2020'],Year’s first thunderstorm catches Kolkata off guard,"Kolkata: The year’s first thunderstorm struck Kolkata on Tuesday, leading to an intense shower in several parts of the city that lasted more than an hour. Some areas of north and east Kolkata received a hailstorm. There could be more such thunderstorms on Wednesday and on Thursday, predicted the Met office. Kolkata received 4.1mm rain till 8.30pm on Tuesday.

Even though rain and thunderstorms were predicted between Wednesday and Friday, they struck early, taking the city by surprise. Dark clouds started gathering around 5.30pm and within the next 15 minutes, the city was lashed by a downpour accompanied by frequent thunder and lightning. The intense spell caught those returning from work off guard.

A cyclonic circulation over Madhya Pradesh triggered the thunderstorm, according to the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC). “It received moisture from a high-pressure zone over Bay of Bengal. The system approached Bengal from the west, leading to thundershowers in the districts of Bankura, Purulia, Birbhum, East and West Midnapore in the morning. As the system moved east, it sailed across the other south Bengal districts triggering similar thunderstorms and rain later in the day,” said RMC director GK Das. East and West Burdwan, Howrah, Hooghly, Nadia, North and South 24 Parganas were lashed by thunderstorms as well.

Sudden bursts of rain and thunderstorm are set to continue over the next two days. A cyclonic circulation or a trough may develop over Jharkhand by Thursday. “It may move southeast and travel across south Bengal, triggering rain. But the rain will be short and intense unlike the drizzles we have in winter. We have already had the first thunderstorm of the season and there will be more,” added Das. Kolkata recorded a maximum temperature of 31.3°C on Tuesday.

The rain slowed down vehicle movement leading to traffic congestions across the city. Central Kolkata came to a virtual halt. EM Bypass, CR Avenue, JL Nehru Road, Vivekananda Road, APC Rod, AJC Bose Road, SN Banerjee Road, Lenin Sarani and Strand Road witnessed congestion through the evening.

“The Met office had predicted rain but I didn’t expect it to be so sharp. The downpour slowed down traffic in central Kolkata. It took me half an hour more to reach my Jadavpur home from my BBD Bag office,” said Shuvam Bera, a bank employee.

A tree got uprooted at Mahatma Gandhi Road while several more and a lamppost were collapsed near Nicco Park in Salt Lake. On February 18, the city had received several spells of light drizzle.

396,['4/03/2020'],"At 79, LU’s historic Tagore Library celebrates memories of the Bard","Lucknow: Tagore Library at Lucknow University — one of the oldest central research libraries in the country — turns 79 on Wednesday. On the eve of its foundation day, TOI finds out how the iconic building was named after polymath and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore.

According to documents, the foundation of the library was laid in 1937 and the facility that was inaugurated in 1941 was initially known as ‘Lucknow University Library’. After Independence however, the building took its name after Gurudev to celebrate his bond with the varsity.

The first LU journal published in 1922 recorded Tagore’s visit to the campus. It stated that on March 6 that year, he delivered a lecture on the vision of India’s history at Bennett Hall (now Malviya Hall).

Not only did Tagore’s lectures echo on the university campus, some of his famous plays were also staged by students. ‘The Waterfall’ (originally Muktadhara), written in 1922 and widely acclaimed as one of Tagore’s finest dramatic works, was staged by the English department at Bennett Hall on January 25 that year. The symbolic play has been interpreted as his nationalist critique of colonial exploitation

Whenever the poet, musician and artist visited the LU campus, he stayed with English professor NK Siddhanta. He had a deep connect with Dhurjati Prasad Mukerji (Economics). In fact, Mukerji penned a couple of books on him too. ‘Tagore: A Study’ and ‘Sur-o-Sangeet’, the latter in Bengali, sheds spotlight on their correspondence on music and art. Tagore also shared a special bond with LU sociology professor Radhakamal Mukerjee.

In November-December 1925, Tagore was on the campus to attend the All Indian Music Conference and listened to Pandit Srikrishna Narayan Ratanjankar, a distinguished scholar and teacher of Hindustani classical music who later served as the principal of Marris Music College (Now Bhatkhande Music Institute).

The visit finds a mention in the thesis of Professor Nupur Sen of LU’s education department. ‘A critical study of Rabindranath Tagore’s contributions to educational thoughts and practices’ also mentions that he came to the campus yet again in February-March 1935 and delivered two lectures.

The paper states that to perpetuate the memory of Tagore’s visits to the campus, a special ceremony was organised to name the library after him.

Deputy librarian Jyoti Mishra told TOI that the library actually opened in 1921, but was initially housed in the main Canning College building, which now houses the faculty of arts.

As the library grew in size and turned home to rare tomes and manuscripts, the need for a separate building was felt. A new library project was chalked out and American landscape architect Walter Burley Griffin — known better for designing Australian capital Canberra — was hired for the job.

The foundation stone was laid by then Chancellor Sir Harry Haig on March 4, 1937, and the new building was inaugurated on April 2, 1941, by then Chancellor Governor Sir M Hallet.

The countdown for the most awaited and upcoming Nagpur Heroes has begun. Citizens as well as avid readers of TOI are excited. Some shared their experience of attending the programme and reading about the inspiring heroes.

Environmentalist Shrikant Deshpande remembered attending the function and shared his thoughts on how the TOI initiative is motivating budding social workers and professionals. “Nagpur Heroes is an amazing initiative by TOI. I feel honoured that I got an opportunity to attend the event last year. This initiative is encouraging others to lend a helping hand to contribute for the development of our city.” he said.

Ravindra Fadnavis, who runs an educational institute, was all praise for this wonderful initiative. “The newspaper had a lot of motivating profiles of the Nagpur Heroes. It was a source of inspiration for many. I would like to congratulate TOI for honouring and acknowledging the work of people who have contributed immensely in their respective fields.” he said.

Right from environment to education, readers enjoyed reading a potpourri of amazing profiles and some were fortunate enough to attend the awards ceremony.

“The message of Nagpur Heroes was loud and clear. The energy at the ceremony was amazing. Every nominee is a hero in his own way. It’s a great feeling to know that such extraordinary personalities reside in our city,” said Bilal Ahmed, a travel operator.

Secretary of Vidarbha Taxpayers’ Association (VTA), Tejinder Singh Renu, was one of the attendees. He believes that the TOI initiative is motivating many, especially youths, to join social service, which is no less than nation building. “Heroic stories inspire citizens to contribute and not complain. My best wishes to the citizens and thanks to Team TOI for providing this fabulous opportunity to Nagpurians.” he said.

Vijay Kant Kumar, a TOI reader, also attended the awards ceremony. He has lauded the TOI initiative which is a great platform to acknowledge the selfless work done by all the nominees. “Such programmes carry a deep message. It’s not only about a token of appreciation, but it’s a celebration of life, work and dedication. I had a wonderful time when I saw so many deserving people winning awards. I’m looking forward to this year’s ceremony.” he said.

“Apart from the routine news, reading a newspaper becomes more enriching when we go through profiles of heroes in the true sense of the word. Nagpur Heroes has a lot to offer in terms of social work and humanity in particular,” said Ayesha Mirza, a home maker.

Kaustav Chatterjee, founder of Green Vigil Foundation, is a regular at the Nagpur Heroes awards function. “Nagpur Heroes is a truly transparent and unique awards ceremony. It is the right platform which recognizes the unsung heroes of the city. The curiosity begins immediately after the announcement. It peaks on the penultimate day with the nominees at par with each other. One can feel the buzz a fortnight before the finale. Even nominees feel like winners as getting nominated is a reward in itself,” he said.

398,['4/03/2020'],Boats supplied under ‘Blue Revolution’ scheme are inferior: Rameswaram fishers,"MADURAI: Fishermen from Rameswaram have petitioned the director of fisheries, G S Sameeran, about the inferior quality boats that were supplied to them under the visionary ‘Blue Revolution’ scheme of the central government. The scheme, under the department of animal husbandry and dairying, aims at increasing fisheries production and productivity from aquaculture and fisheries resources.

General secretary of the Tamil Nadu - Pondicherry Fishermen ’s Federation, N J Bose said the scheme was an outstanding one which aimed at promoting and encouraging deep sea fishing. Fishermen are given a subsidy of Rs 40 lakh by the central government, Rs 16 lakh by the state government, while they had to contribute Rs 24 lakh to purchase a mechanised boat.

However, apart from the Rs 80 lakh for each boat, fishermen have to spend another Rs 50 lakh for infrastructure, nets, manpower etc. “Thus, this is a scheme from which only rich fishermen can benefit, and the subsidy should be increased if all are to benefit,” he said.

So far, the fishermen from Rameswaram have been supplied with 22 boats, of which 16 are from the Cochin Shipping Yard .

Five of these boats had been fitted with inferior engines of 140 HP when an mechanised boat would require a 200 HP motor for smooth operations.

Those whose boats were fitted with the inferior motors were spending much on repair. John Keter, a fisherman who possessed one of these boats, got stranded 170 nautical miles away from the shore and it took him six days to reach the shore, with mechanics guiding him with the help of satellite phones. These engines were also consuming more fuel and emitting black smoke that engulfed the entire boat.

Bose himself had got a boat with an inferior motor and asked the manufacturers to replace it, but it was still to be attended after two months. “They delay the process, but I have to repay the interest for the loan I obtained for the boat, and this is an additional cost for me,” he said.

The area of subsidence that saw buildings fall like a pack of cards begins here. Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), the agency implementing the East-West Metro project, had started evacuation on Sunday by shifting 12 residents.KMRC is extremely cautious this time. No one wants a repeat of August 31 when the TBM digging the west-bound tunnel of the Metro project hit an aquifer and water flooded the tunnel, bringing with it sand and soil. Many buildings had collapsed and several others were damaged in the subsidence that could be arrested only after 12 days.“At that time, our house was damaged even though the TBM was digging at a distance. This time, the tunnelling will be carried out right under our building. We are extremely worried,” said Suneet Sarkar of 4B, Gour De Lane. Durga Pithuri Lane and Shyakrapara Lane were the worst-hit. The buildings of Gour De Lane, next to Shykrapara Lane, were also affected. “The last time we had to stay in a hotel for 28 days. When we came back, we found several cracks in the walls of our house,” the 68-year-old said. “The KMRC notice says we can return on Sunday, but many people haven’t been able to return on the scheduled date. The tunnelling, we were told, is slow and, hence, the delay,” Sarkar said.Although five homes could be evacuated, Somnath Banerjee of 2B, Gour De Lane, refused to leave his house. “I shall not move until my nephew gets the Rs 5 lakh compensation. He refuses to pay the electric bills and house tax because I received the money and he didn’t,” Banerjee told TOI.Urvi’s twin Chundee that hit the aquifer is now lying defunct below Durga Pithuri Lane. It was building the west-bound tunnel. Urvi, was building the east-bound tunnel and had dug till the Nirmal Chunder Street-Chaitan Sen Lane crossing at the time of the tunnelling fiasco and had been stuck ever since.Following a Calcutta high court order to resume tunnelling operations, it resumed digging on February 18. It has built around 1,100 rings till now. As the TBM burrows, an industrial robot places segments of a 1.2m wide pre-cast concrete ring. And thus, a 12m stretch of the tunnel gets created every day. But thanks to Urvi’s slow progress, only around 100m has been covered in the last fortnight.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74469567,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-275090,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/21-residents-move-out-of-metro-cave-in-zone/articleshow/74465487.cms

Nagpur: With most of the people hooked to electronic gadgets these days, it was a soothing experience to see many footfalls at ‘Kokeel Kavya’, organized by Maharashtra Gandhi Smarak Nidhi, Bajaj Nagar, where poets presented many hues of life and won accolades on Tuesday.

Aesthetes had a whale of a time as the programme provided many unheard poets a platform to render their and others’ compositions. Poets poured their heart out in expressing love for poems and kept the audience spellbound with their recitations.

Tributes were paid to freedom fighter Sarojini Naidu in whose memory the programme was organized.

While Sunita Jhade recited poems in Hindi and Marathi which spoke of dying humanity, Minal Evle conveyed the message that a person should fight problems that life throws at.

Gauri Asate reminded that the sense organs should be used to bring about a change in the society as they are meant to be for that purpose. Ability to speak, hear, observe, smell and touch should be utilized to optimum to enjoy every aspect of life, she said.

Other poets spoke on social matters that need to be addressed. A few among them rendered their emotions in a poetic form.

Littérateur Supantha Bhattacharya gave a brief insight into Sarojini Naidu’s poems and explained a few of them. He categorized her poems into three sections — patriotism, cultural and those in which she paid tributes to her colleagues during freedom struggle. Referring to some of her poems, he highlighted the intellect of Naidu.

Khwaja Rabbani shared his thoughts on the poems presented at the programme. In times where technology has taken over humans, it is wonderful to see people gathering, listening and analysing poems, he said.

Anchor Surekha Devghare recited her Hindi poem ‘Phoenix’. Prajwala Tatte paid tributes to Suhasini Sakhre by reciting her poem. Tatte also recited poems written by Naidu.

Poems written by Vaibhav Ogle were translated by Tatte in English. ‘Worry’, a poem, highlighted the worries that humans face in day-to-day life.

Committee chairman Saurabh Bharadwaj said the committee would get the messages fact-checked by an agency and also verify them with a team of legal experts. If the legal team agreed that the content could potentially cause hatred or disturbance or enmity between two communities or groups, it would be forwarded to the law enforcement agencies with a recommendation for criminal prosecution.

“It will be the first time in India that informers of hate messages whose complaints are converted into FIRs will be rewarded with Rs 10,000 each,” Bharadwaj said.

The complaints, said Bharadwaj, could be sent on WhatsApp to the number 8950000946 and email ID ‘dvscommittee@delhi.gov.in’.

Bharadwaj added that sharing fake and hate messages, which could cause enmity between two communities, was a criminal offence and invited a jail term of three years.

“These numbers will be widely publicised through every possible way that will include advertisements on TV, radio, newspapers and other mediums. Hoardings and unipoles will be put up at public spaces, schools, bus stops and in Delhi Metro, hospitals and government offices,” he said.

The committee will also work in close association with a “fact-checking” agency, which will look into the authenticity of the content. A team of lawyers will be formed to provide legal assistance while a group of IT experts will extend technical assistance to the committee.

At its first meeting on Monday, the nine-member committee had observed that unverified hate messages on social media were one of the biggest reasons behind flaring up of communal violence and there was an urgent need to check their circulation.

The other members of the committee are AAP MLAs Abdul Rehman, Atishi, BS Joon, Dilip Pandey, Jarnail Singh, Kuldeep Kumar and Raghav Chadha and BJP legislator Ajay Mahawar.

The committee, Bharadwaj said, would also hold a peace meeting with the six MLAs of the violence-hit areas on February 5. “Prominent religious leaders and people from the civil society of these areas will also join. The committee has observed that before Holi and the Friday prayers, a message of communal harmony should be sent across to avoid any flare-up,” Bharadwaj said, adding that the police commissioner would also be invited for the peace meeting.

MADURAI: A man from Virudhunagar was stabbed to death by his wife’s paramour near Austinpatti in Madurai district.

The murdered man has been identified as M Manikandan, 32, a sales executive at a private bank here. Manikandan was murdered by his wife Jothilakshmi’s paramour S Kathick, 25, of Vellalakshmi Nagar in Austinpatti.

Police sources said Jothilakshmi's father had met with a road accident a few months ago, which left him bedridden for weeks. Jothilakshmi stayed in her parents’ house at Kappalur to take care of her father. She developed an extramarital relationship with Karthick during her stay at her parents’ home.

She returned to her husband’s house recently. When Manikandan learnt about the relationship and picked up a quarrel with her, she went back to her parents' home.

Meanwhile, Karthick approached her parents and urged them to conduct the marriage between them. Her parents denied it, citing that she was married and has a child.

On Monday evening, Karthick picked up Manikandan from his home on his two-wheeler under the pretext of holding peace talks. As he did not return home, Manikandan’s parents started searching for him.

After murdering Manikandan, Karthick went to the home of Jothilakshmi’s parents. He told them that he had murdered Manikandan.

Jothilakshmi’s relative alerted the Austinpatti police. Later, the police nabbed Karthick from a hideout. Based on information provided by him, the body was recovered from a farmland in Gandhi Nagar in Austinpatti. There were at least seven stab injuries on the body.

The body was shifted to the Government Rajaji Hospital and an inquiry was under way with Jothimani and her family members. Meanwhile, a search is also on for Karthick. Police said they will know whether anyone else was involved in the murder.

Sourin Guha Thakurta

KOLKATA: Sanjana Panja left Kolkata six years ago to study in Milan. In all these years, she has never seen Milan so deserted. After the Covid-19 outbreak, schools and universities have suspended classes for two weeks and the bustling streets have gone empty. With the Indian government on Tuesday deciding to cancel all visa/eVisa that had been granted to nationals from Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan on or before March 3, the situation has become complicated.Panja doesn’t want to risk returning to Kolkata now. “I don’t want to take the risk of taking flights where I can contract the virus from any passenger. I also do not want to take the risk of taking the virus to my hometown and endanger my family,” she said.According to her, majority of the Indian students there have already gone back. Sourin Guha Thakurta, a construction engineering student from JU who worked for four years in Kolkata before leaving to do his Masters for Politecnico di Milano, had returned home on February 27. “Most of my friends from India are back. Initially, I thought the situation would be contained. But overnight, I found 100 new cases. Entire milk section of the supermarkets was empty. People were stocking up. That’s when I decided to return home,” he said. “Had I stayed back, my visa would have been cancelled. My university has started e-learning courses and I will not return till the situation improves.”Panja was supposed to go on a trip to the nearby town of Imbersago on last Saturday. “On Friday, the total count of Lombardia in Italy was approximately 73. When we returned from the trip, the count had gone up to 130,” said this former student of Jadavpur University’s architecture department.This rise in figures was enough to get Panja and her friends and acquaintances talking about what to do. “We were constantly messaging each other on Whatsapp to understand what was happening. Five major league football matches were postponed and currently matches are being played in spectator-free stadia. Ten towns in Italy are on lockdown now. Offices and workplaces are open but everyone has instructed employees to take precaution and self-isolate themselves and work from home,” said Panja, who also teaches mathematics in a school.Being the design and marketing head of a fashion company, Panja has also seen the impact of the outbreak on the world’s fashion capital. Giorgio Armani's Autumn/Winter 2020 show at the Milan Fashion Week was held in an empty theatre. The show was livestreamed in front of an empty Teatro [theater] on the Armani website. “I wasn’t attending the show but was aware of the developments. The show was held behind closed doors. People were asked not to attend the show,” she said. In fact, Armani himself was also photographed putting on a face mask as he entered the building. “From Sunday onwards, the cosmetic stores and pharmacies stopped selling masks and sanitizers. Our guess was that since people were not really affected in Milan, they didn’t want to sell masks and sanitizers to avoid panic,” added this Bengali resident of Milano Villapizzone.Canned food available at the supermarkets are fast getting over. “Some have really panicked and not even going out to buy groceries and have stocked up for weeks. Others like us are calm. We are wearing masks and using sanitizers but going out for important works,” she said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74468015,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-35662,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/anxious-bengalis-return-from-italy-some-stay-back/articleshow/74465495.cms

It is for the first time in the state that a sex workers collective meet is held on the sex workers right day, said organizers. Social activist and writer Gargi Harithakam inaugurated the meet.

“Earlier in Kerala, a sex worker Nalini Jameela, shared her life with the public. It is for the first time in the state after this that a group of sex workers called a meet. These types of collectives should open windows to raise their voice in public,” said Gargi.

As part of the meeting a signature campaign was also held in the venue. 52 sex workers from seven districts of the state participated the meeting.

“Sex workers also have a right to live in public. But goons and police officials are attacking us. In the Kottayam KSRTC bus stand the police officials don’t allow us to stay there and tried to forcibly remove us from the area,” said a sex worker, Sindhu (name changed).

“Most of them believe that sex workers choose this job of their own accord. But the reality is that most of them are pushed to this job due to personal and family issues,” said another sex worker, Maya (name changed) “In my case my father sexually abused me at the age of 13 and the family avoided me. But the sex workers didn’t get any consideration from the society and government,” she said.

Rajaneesh M R, programme co-ordinator of the Kerala Network of Sex Workers said, “Sex work is the same as any other job and sex workers have right to do their job. But the sex workers face many issues including police torture and other issues.” “We demand that the government should assure the security of the sex workers,” said Rajaneesh.

414,['4/03/2020'],Poll affidavit: SC junks plea of Devendra Fadnavis for verdict review,"Former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis (File photo)

NEW DELHI: In a setback to former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis , the Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to re-examine its verdict reviving trial for allegedly not disclosing all pending criminal cases against him while filing nomination papers for the 2014 assembly elections.

Reviving the complaint filed by advocate Satish Ukey, the apex court had in October ruled that a candidate must disclose all criminal cases in which the court has taken cognisance at the time of contesting elections. “In view of the clear averments made in the complaint to the effect that Fadnavis had knowledge of two cases against him which had not been mentioned in the affidavit filed by him along with his nomination papers, we unhesitatingly arrive at the conclusion that the order of the trial court, upheld by the Bombay High Court , is legally not tenable and the same deserves to be set aside,” SC had said.

Alleging that his “fate has been sealed” by SC by reviving the trial, Fadnavis sought review of the verdict and contended that it would have huge ramifications for other candidates in future elections as it could be misused. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi , appearing for him, contended that a false case could be filed due to political rivalry and the court could take cognisance of the case just a day before filing of nomination papers and a candidate might not know about it.

Fadnavis contended that in such cases, a person has to face prosecution for not furnishing information which he did not know. He said a candidate should be asked to disclose only those criminal cases in which charges have been framed or chargesheet filed.

But a bench of Justices Arun Mishra, Deepak Gupta and Aniruddha Bose dismissed his petition. “We find no ground to interfere in the review petitions. The same are dismissed,” it said.

The two cases which Fadnavis did not mention in his election affidavit of 2014 are “summary case no. 232 of 1996 (u/s 500 of IPC — defamation) and regular criminal case no. 343 of 2003 under various sections of IPC, both pending before Nagpur courts”.

Referring to letters issued by the Election Commission to the chief electoral officers of all states and UTs, the apex court had said, “A reading of the said letters would go to show that a contesting candidate is mandated to furnish information concerning cases in which a competent court has taken cognisance along with the cases in which charges have been framed.”

So far, there has been no positive case of Covid-19 in the state. All the swab samples collected from Covid-19 suspects in West Bengal tested negative. But the state health department is on its toes and is continuously monitoring 986 persons kept in home isolation, many of them from Kolkata.With increasing number of people returning home from places affected by the virus, the health department has scaled up the number of isolation beds in hospitals, taking more such facilities into the fold.“Though all 28 samples collected from suspects so far have tested negative for the virus, we are on our toes with strict surveillance,” said Dr Ajay Chakraborty, director of health services.Earlier, 30 persons had been kept under observation in hospital isolation. While 89 people who had travelled to the affected regions have completed the home-quarantine period, 986 continue to remain in home isolation till the 28-day surveillance period is over, even if they do not have any symptom.As a precautionary measure, the first isolation facility to treat the affected was set up at Infectious Diseases & Beliaghata General (IB&BG) Hospital in Kolkata with 20 beds, much before India reported its first confirmed Covid-19 case in Kerala. At present, apart from the medical colleges in the city, eight state-run facilities in the districts have also set up isolation wards, taking the number of isolation beds to 92.“So far we have been able to manage. We are equipped to increase our isolation facilities if the situation demands,” Chakraborty added.The Covid-19 scare surfaced in the city in January when a Thai national died at a private city hospital.

418,['4/03/2020'],Railway minister promises electrification by 2021,"Union railway minister Piyush Goyal

AURANGABAD: Union railway minister Piyush Goyal has assured that electrification work in Nanded division would be completed by 2021.

The assurance was given by Goyal to a delegation of advocacy group Aurangabad First that met the minister in Delhi on Monday.

“The railway minister told us that the tendering process for the desired electrification was over and the actual work will commence soon. Goyal said the work would be carried out in a speedy manner. The electrification work would be over by 2021,” Mansingh Pawar of Aurangabad First said on Tuesday.

Fulfilling the long-pending demand, the South Central Railway (SCR), in January 2018, had started a survey for rail electrification in Nanded division. The survey involved collection of details on bridges, level crossings, curves, signals, points-crossings and locations of high tension wires.

Nanded division, which caters to parts of Marathwada including Aurangabad, has nearly 1,000 kilometer of railway track. The meeting between Aurangabad First and railway minister also saw discussion on some other key demands, including pit-line at Aurangabad and new originating trains from Nanded division.

Meanwhile, railway activists sounded skeptical about the deadline announced by the minister.

“Going by the past experiences, we have developed a notion that the railway ministry gives step-motherly treatment to Nanded division for reasons best known to them. The latest example is the track doubling work on the Mudkhed-Parbhani route which took seven years to complete. Still, we hope that the railway minister keeps his word and complete the electrification process by 2021,” railway activist Omprakash Varma said.

Electrification plays an important role in rail operations that help in increasing the capacity of train movements and speeding of rail services. It also ensures seamless operation of trains without change of locomotive engines and reduces running time of passenger trains and makes possible to run longer train.

419,['4/03/2020'],CRRI begins study on Nadukani Ghat Road,"Malappuram: An expert team from Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), Delhi, has started a study on redesigning the Nadukani Ghat Road which was damaged due to multiple landslides triggered by heavy rain in the region last year.

The team led by Vasant G Havanagi, senior principal scientist of CRRI has conducted inspections in various parts of the road, including damaged areas and the inspection will continue for some more days. Chief engineer and other officials of PWD are also accompanying the scientists.

The inter-state highway connecting Nilambur region with Gudalur area in Tamil Nadu was completely washed away in several spots after the heavy rain and landslides in the region during August. After huge rocks were deposited on the road at Thenpara and Thakarappadi the traffic the authorities were forced to completely ban the traffic through the region for many months. As the road spans an 11km area which comes under jurisdiction of Kerala, was seriously damaged in the rain, the PWD authorities have already observed that reconstruction of the road in a conventional method would not be a permanent solution.

G Geetha, executive engineer of PWD (Roads) said that the team is mainly examining the possibility of redesigning and strengthening the road in the areas where the landslips occur frequently.

The team has collected soil samples from different areas of Ghat Road and they have also assessed the depth of rocks. “The team is trying to find the real cause of frequent landslips and landslides in the region. We are expecting that they will suggest proper remedial measures to avoid soilslips in the region, including restructuring and redesigning of road”, she said.

It is expected that the team will wind up the inspection on Friday and submit a detailed report to PWD authorities soon.

PWD Minister G Sudhakaran who recently visited the spot last year had announced that government will consider the demand for redesigning the road with bridges and alternate routes.

Meanwhile the PWD is also considering an alternate route for the Ghat Road, through Munderi, Appankappu and Panthalur. The department has already submitted a proposal for a new inter-state highway through Appankappu, as the better alternative for Nadukani Road. According to the proposal, the inter-state highway can be materialized by developing an existing forest road in 10.2km area from Appankappu tribal colony area near Munderi to Pandalur near Gudalur in Tamil Nadu. The total distance from Appankappu to Pandalur in Tamil Nadu is 10.2km.

420,['4/03/2020'],Residents suffer as packaged water dealers go out of sight,"MADURAI: Dealers switched off their phones while shops took off their 20 litre water cans from view as the strike by packaged water manufacturers entered the sixth day. People struggled to mobilize water as some shops demanded up to Rs 100 per can from those who approached them desperately.

Though the corporation had laid street taps in many of the 28 new wards, the water supplied through them is high in salinity and not fit for drinking or cooking. Places like Anna Nagar, Gomathipuram , Thapalthanthi Nagar, Athikulam and Vilangudi do not have drinking water supply through taps. While the corporation tankers supply water to a small portion in these wards, they never go into the narrower streets like Nehru street, and Roja street in Gomathypuram . ``I have never had the privilege of collecting free water from the corporation water tankers in all the ten years that I have lived here,’’ said Thangam of Gomathypuram.

For people like her, the supply of private packaged water by local dealers was a boon. ``In fact, I know my packaged water dealer better than my milkman or postman, but now he is refusing to pick up my phone calls, which is disturbing,’’ said Rajeswari of Tahsildar Nagar .

Offices that do not have RO plants, which usually have a stock of about 10 cans, are running dry and trying to source water from the corporation taps in the neighbouring areas as bottled water is too expensive. ``Installing an RO plant is not a solution as we do not have ground water and the borewell is dry. Packaged water is the only solution,’’ said S Kumaresan of Vandiyur. He says the court’s intervention to check the illegal units is justified but it was the responsibility of the government to ensure that people had an alternative drinking water source.

There are about 80 packaged drinking water dealers supplying about two lakh litres of water per day in the city alone. However, packaged water cans are nowhere to be seen now. Sources from the package water manufacturers association say they are ready to supply water as soon as the court allows them.

421,['4/03/2020'],Delhi riots: Subhash mohalla in Yamuna Vihar swears by its unity in diversity,"Hindu and Muslim families prepared food at a temple for those affected by the riots

NEW DELHI: On a lane in Subhash mohalla in Yamuna Vihar, a Shiv temple stands. It escaped any harm during last week’s communal riots. The temple priest testified that the Muslim residents ensured its safety. On Tuesday, Hindu and Muslim families prepared food at the temple for those affected by the riots.

As pujari Achal Sharma performed his daily rituals, Asif Khan and his wife Nusrat arrived. Khan recalled, “We convinced residents not to believe in the rumours. People were scared as there were slogans being chanted and sounds of gunfire. But we stood together.” Nusrat’s beauty parlour in Bhajanpura was vandalised. “Our house stayed intact and we ensured other houses too remained undamaged,” Khan added. “With the love we share here, we will rebuild the parlour.”

Anil Kumari, Sharma’s mother, said self-assuredly that the Muslims in the locality would sacrifice their lives for the temple. “This is the love we share,” she said. The priest also said that when the Babri Masjid riots rocked the country in 1992, “not a leaf on this lane was shaken and never will”.

According to Shabbir Ahmed, “Each night, Pandit ji and we stood guard at the lane entries. Others brought us tea to help us stay awake.” Retired CISF employee Ramesh Chandra Walia added, “Even women did guard duty, staying alert during daytime too.”

In Shiv Vihar too, the spirit of harmony helped neighbours avoid violence. Rajaram, 60, who runs a school in the area, said, “When Hindus saw Muslims in trouble or vice-versa, they intervened to save each other. We have been living together for 33 years. It was outsiders who indulged in violence.” Neighbours came to the assistance of Sajid Hassan and his family. “There was a wedding in my family on February 25, so we had many guests in our house. Our neighbours hid most of us in their houses and we left when police arrived in the morning,” said Hassan.

422,['4/03/2020'],Goa: No duplication of courses by private universities will be allowed under new law,"Representative image

PANAJI: Education officials said that as and when private universities establish institutes in Goa, it will be ensured that there is no duplication of programmes already available in the state.

The state cabinet has given its approval to the Goa Private Universities Bill, 2020. Currently there is only the state-funded Goa University and the new bill will allow institutes affiliated to private institutes to establish campuses here.

As per the provisions of the bill, a committee will be set up to scrutinise and approve the programmes, officials said.

“In no way will institutes offering general stream programmes be allowed to offer programmes in the state. We have sufficient number of colleges offering such programmes to meet the current demand,” a senior education official said.

Similarly, programmes like engineering will also not be allowed as there are already five institutes in the state, besides the IIT and NIT, the official said.

“A committee set up by the state will ensure that only programme that are currently not available in the state are allowed. The state will give preference to niche programmes like in space technology. Goa could also do with another medical programme other than the state-funded one at Goa Medical College,” the official said.

The bill is presently awaiting the governor’s nod, director of higher education Prasad Lolayekar said, adding that currently there are no proposals with the directorate of higher education.

An official said that the state is hoping to be modelled as an education hub, where students from other states will be attracted to come and study at these private universities.

“Goa obviously does not have the kind of numbers that can make such institutes feasible. It means that students from outside the state will be attracted to come and study here. This will boost the local economy in many ways,” an official said.

Started in June last year, the new department will admit students for postgraduate courses even if they do not have a bachelor’s degree in dramatics and folk art. University senate member Sambhaji Bhosale said relaxation in admission rules would be applicable from the next academic year.

“Vice-chancellor Pramod Yeole has been strongly advocating interdisciplinary studies and sought necessary proposal to amend the existing rules. The move is expected to witness more takers for the course,” he said.

Bhosale said no educational institution in Osmanabad offers bachelor’s degree in dramatics and folk art. “It was one of the reasons behind changing the admission rules,” he said.

The new department currently has an intake capacity of 30 students, which will be also increased to 60 from the next academic year.

As part of promotional activity, the department of dramatics and folk art at the Osmanabad sub-centre had organised one-act play competition during the weekend and it received good response.

“The two-day event also provided students and local artists a platform to showcase their talent. More such activities would be organised in future for promoting the new department,” a Bamu official said.

Speaking at the inaugural programme of the event, artist and film-maker Dilip Bhosale appealed to the youth from Marathwada to refrain from developing inferiority complex.

“The youth from Marathwada is as talented as other students from the country. There is a need to tap the potential in youth and the new university department would definitely act in this direction,” he said.

Came into existence on August 16, 2004, the Osmanabad sub-centre of BAMU caters to educational needs of students from Osmanabad district and nearby cities.

KOCHI: Hoteliers who used to discharge food waste and toilet waste to drains and canals will no longer be able to do so as the district administration has started closing these pipelines as part of Operation Breakthrough . Likewise, the pipelines which carry toilet from residences will also be closed.

District collector has given instruction in this regard and contractors have started closing the pipelines. However, residents have raised their objections and councillors are starting to feel the heat.

“Residents and hoteliers used to discharge waste water to drains without any objection from authorities so far. But, with the closing of openings, residents won’t be able to do so. Though we reason with them, they, especially housewives, get angry with us. We tell them the drains are meant for stormwater and residents cannot discharge waste into them. The problem is that 90% residents in Kochi do not have facility in their houses to discharge waste water. Similarly, the hoteliers have been discharging all food waste to drains and blocking them,” said Krishnakumar , Ernakulam south councilor.

District administration officials said they have asked workers to close all the openings from toilets to drains and canals. “If the residents raise the issue before the councillors, peoples’ representatives should make them understand that the drains and canals are not the place to dump toilet waste,” said an official.

Meanwhile on Tuesday, the district administration has approved 28 more new works to be undertaken in the second phase of Operation Breakthrough. Works in the second phase are estimated to cost Rs 16.5 crore.

About 75% works in the first phase have been completed. Though the government sanctioned Rs 10 crore for first phase, only Rs 4 crore has reached the account of the administration, said sources.

430,['4/03/2020'],Exam lapses: Governor Arif Mohammad Khan seeks report from Calicut University VC,"Arif Mohammad Khan

KOZHIKODE: Governor Arif Mohammad Khan has sought an urgent report from Calicut University based on the report published by TOI on February 12 about the serious lapses in its conduct of exams. The principal secretary to the governor has written a letter to the vice-chancellor, asking him to submit an urgent report in this regard within seven days.

The latest audit report (2017-18) had pointed out various lapses including not maintaining proper record of answer sheet distributed to colleges for conducting exams, which could be misused. Among other lapses, the report had said that CU allowed principals of affiliated colleges to correct internal marks of students after they were uploaded to the website in four instances and there were several instances of evaluators recording wrong marks in the facing sheet of answer sheet.

The syndicates exam standing committee met on Tuesday to discuss the matter. A decision was taken at the meeting to make changes in CU’s exam software to enable affiliated colleges upload the number of answer papers used for exam and the surplus answer sheets held by them so that CU can track the answer sheets distributed to colleges.

More significantly, it has now been revealed that the CU has recently received an audit enquiry as part of CAG inspection for the year 2018-19 over improper maintenance of answer sheet stocks.

The senior audit officer pointed out that the stock register of answer books in the prescribed form is not maintained at CU and the details of issue of answer books to varsity’s study departments and affiliated colleges is not maintained at the university. The audit team will wait for specific remarks from CU on audit enquiries before making final comments.

The audit officer also pointed out that as per the instructions issued by Cu to the chief superintendents of examinations, a quarterly report on the stock of blank answer books is to be forwarded to the joint controller of examinations. But no such data is available in the monitoring section of answer books.

Another serious point raised by the audit officer is that there was no system to monitor or ascertain the number of answer books and additional sheets already present in affiliated colleges and study departments. Hence, chances of malpractices couldn’t be ruled out.

“In 2018-19, 4,385 bundles of answer books and 5,638 additional sheets were supplied to the store. There were huge bundles of answer books and additional sheets in the store. Unused, old damaged answer books were dumped in the same store, the details of which were not available, said the audit enquiry sent to CU in December 2019. It added that there was no mechanism to fix responsibility for instances of missing/ non- tallying of answer books.

The petition has been signed by nearly 35,000 people across the state. Almost all schools have informed CBSE about the complaints from students.

The students have expressed their concern over the remaining theory exams as well. Parents and teachers said the students are yet to come in terms with the Physics exam and that it would affect the preparations for the remaining exams.

“My daughter returned home and said she could not even attempt all questions though she was well-prepared. It took her nearly one hour to answer Section A which featured 20 MCQs carrying single marks. She did not even eat the whole day and collapsed at night. We had to take her to a hospital. Many other students are also still in shock,” said a parent.

Many students and parents said the question paper included out of syllabus questions.

“Physics paper is always a bit tough but this time it was tougher than we expected. 90% questions were application-level questions while in curriculum only 33% is allowed. There were some out of syllabus questions. For example, the question on electric field on the axis of a uniformly charged ring was out of syllabus. Almost all questions were difficult to comprehend even for those students who have worked out the questions papers of previous years,” said a Physics teacher.

The CBSE had earlier said the moderation policy has been stopped from this year onwards. “This is not fair as the board was allowed to give grace marks to the previous batches and for succeeding batches, the syllabus would be reduced. The present Class XII students will neither have a reduction in the syllabus nor grace marks,” said a student.

432,['4/03/2020'],Councillors demand alternative for WTE plant,"Kochi: Councillors who attended corporation council meeting on Tuesday to discuss waste management stressed the need to consider alternative proposals with the National Green Tribunal (NGT) team questioning the viability of the waste-to-energy (WTE) plant at Brahmapuram. Reduction of waste at source, recycling and reuse, among other things, should be encouraged, they opined.

Councillors cutting across party lines raised objection against the state government’s decision to convert the concessionaire agreement, signed between the corporation and GJ Eco Power Private Limited allotting 23 acres of land for setting up the plant, into a lease agreement.

“We shouldn’t depend solely on the proposed WTE plant. Alternative projects must be considered, which can promote reduction, recycling and reuse of garbage,” said V P Chandran, secretary, LDF parliamentary party, Kochi Corporation.

A B Sabu, Congress councillor and former chairman of welfare standing committee, said the conversion of the concessionaire agreement into lease agreement would be detrimental for the local body.

“The private firm would be mortgaging the property for raising funds to set up the plant. If the private firm fails to repay the loan, the responsibility of paying back the amount would fall on the local body. Then, the corporation will lose the land,” Sabu said.

C K Peter, councillor from Konthuruthy, said the local body has been shelling out a huge sum for transportation and treatment of waste and improving infrastructure facilities at the solid waste treatment plant at Brahmapuram.

“The corporation has spent Rs 3.22 crore for hiring trucks in 2015-16 fiscal while it increased to Rs 3.68 crore in 2016-17 fiscal. In 2017-18, the amount stood at Rs 4.78 crore and increased to Rs 6.86 crore in 2018-19. The cost of treatment of waste has also been going up,” Peter said.

K J Antony, opposition leader, said leasing out the 23 acres to the private firm can’t be approved. It will lead to alienation of the land, he said. Gracy Babu Jacob, a ruling front councillor, said the local body authorities have miserably failed in ensuring effective waste management. “The corporation has been spending crores for hiring trucks for carrying garbage from the city to Brahmapuram. Still, many trucks, bought by the corporation have been lying idle at a yard,” she said.

Many of the councillors said the local body has been spending so much money to improve the infrastructure at Brahmapuram. It is suspected to have helped GJ Eco Power. “We have been erecting a 530kVA tower-line at Brahmapuram at a cost of Rs 42 lakh. It should have been done by the private company as it stands to benefit from it,” Peter said.

Ironically, the council meeting held for finding a solution to the vexed issue of garbage treatment failed to pass 13 out of the total 14 items in the agenda of the meeting. While mayor Soumini Jain blamed the opposition for objecting to the proposal alleging corruption, the opposition leaders said proposals worth crores were introduced without discussion with concerned committees.

Through his initiative, Grace Cancer Foundation, the oncologist has reached remote areas across Telangana and Andhra Pradesh to perform cancer screening and awareness programmes for locals.

“In rural areas, not everybody is educated to keep track of their health. We teach them basic self-test techniques. At our mobile screening units, we perform a thorough five-stage procedure and give them the results there and then. If somebody is found to have cancer, we refer them to the nearest centre where they can receive treatment under the Aarogyasri scheme,” says Dr Chinnababu.

The doctor has now expanded his initiative and established the Indur Cancer Hospital in Nizamabad where he can be found every Friday, sometimes supervising two simultaneous surgeries in different halls. “My payment lies in people’s smiles. I want to be an agent of change,” the doctor says. The centre performs around 30 surgeries and 300 chemotherapy procedures every month.

One of the beneficiaries under Dr Chinnababu’s schemes, Mr Abdus Salim from Warangal says: “It is because of the foundation that my cancer was detected. I was having severe bleeding issues and could not afford treatment. But due to the foundation’s efforts, I was operated free of cost and now am on a path of speedy recovery. Ek nayi zindagi mil gayi hai.” Salim was suffering from rectal cancer and underwent robotic abdominoperineal resection on February 13.

“I thought there was little hope for my wife as treatment was impossible given our financial situation. But through Grace Foundation, she received free treatment and is now recovering well,” says Ghouse Mohiuddin, a resident of Tolichowki.

While Dr Chinnababu is satisfied with the number of cases cured through his foundation, his ultimate goal is to educate and create awareness. “If people are educated and shown that lifestyle changes can help them lead healthy lives, it will go long way than simply curing them,” he says.

435,['4/03/2020'],Delhi shows its big heart: People offer own homes for relief work,"Members of Shiromani Akali Dal provide food and clothing to victims of violence at Mustafabad

NEW DELHI: People are opening up their hearts and their homes to citizens affected by last week’s violence in northeast Delhi. While members of the Shiromani Akali Dal provided relief material to riot victims at Mustafabad and Shiv Vihar on Tuesday, in other areas, people have offered their own homes to civil society for use at relief camps and medico-legal facilities.

Prabhrit Singh Sarna, who was accompanying his father, SAD Delhi president Paramjeet Singh Sarna, revealed that the elder Sarna had recalled the Sikh riots of 1984 when they visited the violence scarred northeast Delhi. “He said the sight reminded him of 1984,” said Prabhrit, who described SAD’s relief distribution as adhering to the Sikh tenet of seva bhav.

Several trucks filled with food and clothing went around Mustafabad and Shiv Vihar. At the Eidgah relief camp, the SAD city head met the victims expressed happiness that with the sub-divisional magistrate and government officials themselves involved in the compensation filing, the relief effort would be quickened.

“I told the officials that they should visit the relief camps and try to provide the compensation amount as soon as possible because the victims people have lost a lot,” the senior Sarna said. “We want the chief minister and ministers to meet people. That is how you remove their grief. People shouldn't be scared to go back to the mosques and pray.”

The relief camps were in full swing on Tuesday, providing materials and other help to the dislocated people. Jameel Ahmed, an imam of a mosque at Babu Nagar, opened up a room in his home for the civil society group that had to shift its free medical service camp from Al-Islah School. “I wanted to provide whatever assistance in helping people get back on their feet, so made space in my home for the medical camp,” Ahmed said.

Ahmed’s neighbour Mohammad Dilshad also went ahead and freed the living room in his home for medico-legal work. “We have told the relief providers that we are ready for everything. Everyone faces bad times, but we can all do something to help,” Dilshad philosophised.

Mangaluru: It has been a dream come true for Sayyed Muhammed Saleem, 29, a resident of Ullal , working in Kuwait . On his Royal Enfield Classic 350, he has completed a solo ride in 39 days covering a distance of 12,635 kms and visiting more than 100 cities and riding on some of the treacherous Himalayan stretches. A member of Mangalore Bulls Motorcycle Club , Saleem started his journey from Kadri on January 8 and returned on February 15.

“It is one of the most memorable journeys of my life. I did face a few problems — travelling in the wrong direction once, maintenance and repairs on the bike etc. North Indians have a lot of respect for South Indians and it is not at all dangerous to travel alone. Whenever I needed a break, I relaxed near toll gates as I felt they were safer. On an average, I covered a maximum of 500-800 kms per day and there were also days when I rode only 50 kms, “ he said.

Although Saleem had not planned in advance for the trip, he had always wanted to ride to Nepal. From Mangaluru, he travelled to Hyderabad, Nagpur, Varanasi and Sanwali. On the Indian- Nepal border, after all the formalities and permits, he travelled to Chitwan district and spent about three days there. Subsequently, he went to Pokhara and Jomsom .

“At a few stretches, it was very difficult to ride. In fact, two-wheeler riders generally denied permission there because of the risks involved. I had to ride at a very slow speed. It took almost two days to complete 100 kms,” he said.

He also participated in the Brotherhood of Bulleteers Motorcycling Consortium Rider Mania in Nepal.

From Nepal, he went to Gangtok. “ At some stretches, I was probably the only one riding a bike,” said Saleem. From Gangtok , he left for Jaigon and after completing formalities, went to Tiger’s Nest Monastery in Bhutan , also known as Paro Takstang. After spending some time in Bhutan, he travelled back to India, via Agra, Lucknow, Indore and Pune.

“After returning to India, I visited major tourist spots in north and enjoyed local cuisine. Subsequently, I travelled to Belagavi and via Hubbali- Ankola and returned back to Mangaluru,” Saleem added.

State school education minister Varsha Gaikwad , while making a formal announcement about Education Day last month, had said the new initiative would be introduced on the lines of Lokshahi Din that witnesses redressal of complaints and issues related to different government offices.

As part of Education Day, complaint-boxes were supposed to be installed in schools for lodging complaints related to academic and non-academic fields. A grievance redressal committee each at the level of school, district and division were also expected to set up for complaint redressal.

When contacted, Aurangabad zilla parishad education officer (primary) S P Jaiswal said no official communication was received from the government for observing Education Day.

“We are expecting official guidelines for observing Education Day. Once the official communication is received, we will follow the guidelines in letter and spirit,” he said.

Educational activist Prashant Sathe said Education Day announced by the government could be fruitful for students and parents if implemented in a wholehearted manner.

“The concept behind the initiative is good and could improve the school functioning significantly. Proper official attention could ensure that Education Day runs on a sustained basis,” he said.

Meanwhile, Gaikwad could not be reached for comments.

438,['4/03/2020'],Officials play blame game as travellers of Vasco-Collem trains complain of delays,"Representative image

MARGAO: Inordinate delays in running of local passenger trains between Vasco and Collem along the South Western Railway (SWR) route has irked regular commuters. As repeated complaints registered at various railway stations enroute have failed to yield the desired results, enraged commuters have threatened to stage a protest at the railway stations.

Commuters said that while they often reached late for work in Vasco on account of late running of 56961 Collem-Vasco train, inordinately long halts at intermediate stations of 56966 Vasco-Collem train almost every day subjects them to “stressful situations”.

Anupkumar Desai, a resident of Cacora, who works as an instructor at the industrial training institute at Vasco, says that the late running of the Collem-Vasco train affects his official as well as domestic schedules.

“The scheduled arrival of Collem-Vasco train at Vasco is 8.20am. But the train invariably runs late and reaches Vasco well past 9am. The Vasco-Collem train departs from Vasco at 5.30pm and should reach Collem at 7.10pm, but it never reaches on time, and many a times is delayed by more than half-an-hour. Imagine the plight of regular commuters like me who leave from home as early as 6.30am to catch the morning train,” Desai said.

Joseph Fernandes from Sanguem, also a regular commuter, said, “Our patience is now wearing thin. We are getting no proper explanation from the railway officials for the train delays. The other day, irate commuters pulled the emergency alarm to stop the train in protest at Majorda after it had halted at the station for over 20 minutes,” he said.

The situation has led to a blame game between the Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd (KRCL) and the South Western Railway. Margao and Majorda railway stations come under the Konkan Railway section. Highly placed sources in the SWR said that the Vasco-Collem train has often to be detained at Majorda railway station for want of path clearance from the Konkan Railway’s Margao railway station.

“The problem is mostly due to large volume of traffic on the Konkan Railway route. As the track is engaged for the movement of several long-distance trains through Margao station, the signal displays ‘no path’ and the local trains have to be detained at Majorda or preceding stations until the path clearance signal is given from Margao station,” a SWR source familiar with the signalling system on the route in Goa told TOI.

Deputy general manager, public relations, KRCL, Baban Ghatge, however, had a different version to attribute to the late running of local trains. “As there is a movement of large number of goods’ trains along the route around the same time, the SWR may be giving preference to goods trains. The Konkan Railway has no role to play in scheduling of the trains,” Ghatge said.

The spokespersons of the SWR however, failed to provide any official statement over the matter.

President of the Sanvordem-Curchorem Rail Users Association Devanand Bhandari urged for close coordination between the KRCL and SWR so that regular commuters along the route aren’t affected.

Kolhapur: Hearing of a complaint filed by Akkalkot tehsildar against BJP Solapur MP Dr Jaysiddheshwar Mahaswami for allegedly submitting fake caste certificate is expected to begin in Solapur court on Wednesday.

Earlier, Bombay high court on Monday, refused to grant any interim stay on the hearing on the ground that Akkalkot tehsildar had already filed complaint against Mahaswami. The HC had said that they would have given stay had the tehsildar not filed any complaint. The next hearing of the case in high court is scheduled for Friday.

Akkalkot tehsildar Balsaheb Sirsat filed a criminal complaint against Mahaswami as directed by district caste verification committee. The complaint was filed on Saturday.

The complaint has been filed under various sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC) including 467 (forgery of valuable security or will and etc) 469 (forgery for purpose of harming reputation), 471 (using as a genuine forged document) and 480 (using false trademark).

BJP MP is in trouble because his caste certificate was declared invalid by district caste verification committee on February 24. The committee has said in its ruling that Mahaswami belongs to Jangam community while he submitted a certificate showing that he is from Beda Jangam community. The committee had ordered Akkalkot tehsildar to file criminal case in the court.

441,['4/03/2020'],"‘Saints championed cause of brotherhood, social harmony’","Sardar Atal Bahadur Singh was felicitated on his 79th birthday, on Monday

Nagpur: Saints laid the foundation of equality and set a benchmark for the society to follow certain norms to keep the social fabric intact. They were the real harbingers of peace as is evident in their literature, said Sachin Pawar, editor of Warkari Darshan, Pune, at university convocation hall on Monday.

He was delivering the keynote address on ‘Santanche samajik yogdan’, organized by Nagpur University and Navshakti Mitramandal as part of Sardar Atal Bahadur Singh lecture series. Vice-chancellor SP Kane, officiating pro-VC Vinayak Deshpande, former MP Datta Meghe and former mayor Atal Bahadur Singh were the chief guests.

With caste and creed taking the centre stage in the present context, the teachings of saints who always promoted brotherhood should be assiduously followed. Their words of wisdom should be implemented to keep the society well-knitted, he said.

“Saints like Dnyaneshwar, Tukaram and Namdev were at the forefront of enlightening the society of the perils of caste and creed. They did not allow caste to become a barrier and treated all as one. We need this ‘oneness’ at this juncture,” Pawar said.

Maharashtra has the rich legacy of ushering in social reforms. This land not only produced saints but also towering social reformers who brought about a change and ensured that people lived with harmony. Therefore, it is the duty of the society to stay united irrespective of differences of opinions, he added.

Expansion of social networks seems to have made people forget values their forefathers strove for. People should not allow vested interests take control of their life, he said.

In his introductory remarks, Sahebrao Raut underlined the need to keep aloft the values saints and social reformers preached for centuries and carry forward their mission.

Kane thanked Pawar for highlighting important issues. Pawar and Atal Bahadur Singh were felicitated on the occasion.

Amrita Indurkar conducted the proceedings.

442,['4/03/2020'],UP: Retired IAS to reboot free SC/ST coaching,"One of the free coaching centres

LUCKNOW: Taking note of the dismal record of the free coaching institutes for SC/ST and OBC aspirants to help them prepare for the civil services exam, the social welfare department is now planning to appoint retired IAS officials at the helm of these institutes to streamline their operations and deliver better results.

In the past 20 years, only three students of these coaching institutes could make it to Indian Revenue Service (IRS) and customs and excise, while some cleared other exams, but none were able to gain entry into the IAS or IPS.

Officials say the infrastructure of these residential coaching centres is so poor that around 200-300 seats of the 1,250 on offer are vacant and cite poor policy and lack of funds as reasons for the poor conditions.

There are seven institutes in UP — two in Lucknow and one each in Prayagraj, Hapur, Aligarh, Agra and Varanasi.

The building of the co-ed institute in Hapur is in a rundown state and needs immediate repairs and renovation. Around 300 seats are vacant due to the poor state of buildings and lack of resources, said an official. Students, whose family income is less than Rs 6 lakh per annum, are selected for the coaching through a written test.

Retd IAS to head 6 out of 7 centres

“These coaching institutes were set up by Mayawati government. The idea was good, but due to practical operational difficulties their results have not been up to the mark. The government is, however, addressing these issues and we are planning to improve the quality of education in these institutes,” said a senior government official.

The department is planning to post retired IAS officers as head of six of the seven institutes for a term of two years to streamline their functioning and improve results.

“Earlier, the coaching duration was just six months, but in 2019, we increased it to a year. The coaching for a tough exam like civil services cannot be of six months since the duration is too short to prepare the aspirants well enough to crack the exam. However, many students we get come from underprivileged category background and they are happy to clear recruitment exam for lower jobs after undergoing the coaching. We need to motivate them to work harder to qualify for IAS and IPS,” the officer said.

“There are certain other aspects also which need a rethink. For instance, students can take this coaching just once. Civil services aspirants prepare for years, hence those from deprived sections cannot be expected to clear the exam in one attempt. Besides, the guest lecturers are also not paid very well, which is one reason why the quality gets compromised. The appointment of retired bureaucrats as directors of these institutes would improve functioning and results,” he said.

KOCHI: The high court on Tuesday allowed 34 Class X students of Arooja’s Little Stars School at Moolamkuzhi here to write the remaining CBSE board exams.

A division bench of Justice AM Shaffique and Justice VG Arun issued the order after considering an appeal by 28 students through advocate T Sanjay. They had challenged a single bench’s decision not to allow them to appear for the ongoing exams.

In addition to the 28 students, the division bench also allowed six more students of the school, who were not parties in the appeal, to appear for the exams.

The court also allowed four students of Al Azhar school of Palluruthy, who were in a similar predicament, to appear for the remaining exams.

Through the interim order, the court directed CBSE to allow the students to appear for the exams provisionally. As per the order, the students can appear for the exams to be held on March 4, 12, and 18. The court clarified that the students cannot claim any equity on account of its interim order and that declaration of their results will be subject to further orders to be passed by it.

The interim order came after CBSE informed the court that it is not possible to file an affidavit explaining whether any student from any unrecognized school has been allowed to write the ongoing Class X exams through any recognized school. CBSE had told the court that there are around 25,000 schools under it and it was practically difficult to file an affidavit on the issue.

During the hearing, CBSE had submitted that Arooja’s school lacked basic facilities and there aren’t adequate toilets for its 350 students. The state government also informed the court that Arooja’s school did not have the required facilities and that it operates in a very small space. The government further submitted that there are practical difficulties in allowing the students from unrecognized schools to appear for board exams conducted by it as the subjects and internal assessment methods differ. The court will consider the case again on March 23.

Figures show that bigger companies outside the state control half of the IMFL supplied in the state.While a minuscule share of IMFL is produced from outside the state by such companies, the rest of the IMFL supplied is manufactured in the locally-registered units, many of which function as proxy units for the outsiders. According to excise department sources, the outside majors enter into a ‘tie-up’ arrangement with the local manufacturers, who lease out their men and machinery to the outsiders on commission basis for the outsiders to manufacture their products here, on commission basis per case of IMFL produced.Data accessed by TOI for 2016-17, 2017-18 and first half of 2018-19, shows that the actual share of outside liquor manufacturers who supply their products by producing them in the local units in the state are 46.78%, 43.61% and 35.34%, respectively. This is in addition to the 8% that are brought from outside the state, which would take the market share of outsiders to more than 50%.As per data, some of the outsiders from Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh and Goa have manufactured all their products in the state from local units like Empee Distilleries, Polsons Distillery, United Distilleries and Elite Distilleries.With the latest excise policy deciding to charge Rs 2 lakh per company entering into a tie-up with a local company, it is expected that the government will earn at least Rs 1 crore.At present, the state has issued licences to 18 compounding blending and bottling units, and three breweries. Of these, 17 blending units are operational, while United Spirits Limited at Cherthala and Palakkad are dysfunctional, though their licences are still valid. Till now, the government has been charging approximately Rs 6 lakh per year as licence fee for a blending unit, and approximately Rs 4 lakh per year for a brewery licence.

450,['4/03/2020'],BJP ignored pipeline project: Cong-NCP,"Kolhapur: Congress and NCP corporators on Tuesday slammed their counterparts from BJP and Tararani Aghadi leaders for delay in completion of Kalammawadi direct pipeline project .

The Rs 488 crore project meant to supply water from Kalammawadi dam to the city started in 2014. On Monday, BJP-Tararani Aghadi corporators, who are in opposition in the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC), had stated that owing to poor planning the project is yet to be completed and Congress leaders should be held responsible for it.

In reply, Congress and NCP corporators on Tuesday said since 2014, the BJP was in power and did nothing to get the permissions required from various departments to speed up the work.

Sharangdhar Deshmukh, Congress corporator, said, “We believe that for petty political gains, the then minister and now BJP’s state president Chandrakant Patil and former BJP MLA Amal Mahadik obstructed various departments from granting permissions. Both did not hold a single meeting with authorities to speed up the work or visit the project sites. We believe this project is very important for the citizens. Around 90% of the work has been completed and we are hopeful that the project will be commissioned by this year end.”

The opposition has challenged the Congress and NCP corporators to complete the project and start supplying drinking water to the citizens before the civic elections that are due in November this year.

“If the project is commissioned, the BJP-Tararani Aghadi will not contest the election and if not then the Congress and NCP should stay away from contesting,” said BJP corporator Vijay Suryawanshi.

Deputy mayor Sanjay Mohite said, “In recent Lok Sabha and state assembly elections, the BJP-Tararani Aghadi corporators raised the issue of delays in pipeline project. However, people did not buy their argument. They were the ones who opposed the project and do not have right to speak on it.”

AHMEDABAD: Two cattle owners were booked for attempted culpable homicide by city police on Monday, as their cows hit a five-year-old girl in the Odhav area of the city on Sunday night. The two were also booked under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act as the girl belongs to a Dalit community. The accused knew it and allegedly hurled casteist abuse at her father.

In his FIR with Odhav police, Hitendra Parmar, 26, a resident of Umiyanagar near Rabari Vasahat, stated that the two accused, Ashish Desai and Amrut Desai, both around 25 and residents of the same neighbourhood, were herding 10 cows when Parmar’s five-year-old daughter Neha suffered injuries.

Parmar said the incident took place due to the negligence of the duo, who were prodding the cows along by hitting them with sticks while riding two motorcycles.

“On Sunday at around 8.30pm, my children were playing outside the house and the two accused were herding their cows, during which a cow hit my daughter. She suffered severe injuries to her shoulder. Another girl who was playing with my daughter also suffered injuries,” Parmar said in the FIR.

Parmar and other local residents rushed to help the injured girl and some of them reprimanded the duo for their negligence. The two accused persons, instead of showing remorse, began threatening the residents.

The duo threatened Parmar with dire consequences if he allowed his children to play outside again, claiming that they obstructed the path of his cattle, the FIR states.

Parmar then took his daughter to Shardaben Hospital in Saraspur, where she was diagnosed with multiple fractures in her shoulder. Parmar later approached Odhav police and filed a complaint against Ashish and Amrut.

Inspector Ravirajsinh Jadeja of Odhav police said the case was transferred to the ACP of the SC/ST cell for investigation. “The accused persons uttered casteist slurs and hence atrocity charges were invoked against them,” he said.

DEHRADUN: An MBBS final year student of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Rishikesh hanged himself at his college hostel late on Monday.

The body has been handed over to the family after conducting post mortem.

Talking to TOI, PRO of AIIMS Rishikesh Harish Thapliyal said that the student, identified as Saheb Deep Singh (21) and a resident of Punjab, was found hanging in his hostel room. “We had informed police and an FIR was also registered. The brother and uncle of the deceased had reached AIIMS to claim the body,” he said, adding that a suicide note was recovered from the boy’s room which mentioned that no one should be blamed for the act.

According to Singh’s teachers, he was one of the brightest students of his class and used to score among top 10 in all subjects. He was also good in sports and used to play badminton.

“There was no sign of depressing in him. His father met with an accident last month due to which he was bedridden but he was recovered now. So, we don’t see any point of him killing himself for any reason,” a teacher said.

Meanwhile, the institution observed condolence of two minutes to remember the student. His friends and teachers are in a state of shock.

“While finances and domestic violence are prime reason of suicides in the country, academic stress is a major reason for suicides among both female and male students in India,” said Dr Vipul Singh, a psychologist.

The number of confirmed cases has already crossed 80,000 worldwide and more countries are reporting their first coronavirus fatalities. With no vaccine or definitive cure in sight, people across the globe are frantically searching for means to prevent themselves from this fatal infection.It is important to get your basics right when you are dealing with any kind of infectious disease and the same is applicable to COVID-19. This respiratory condition is known to spread through droplets and vapours that we eject through our mouth as we cough, sneeze or talk. If you get these respiratory droplets in your hands and touch your mouth, nose and eyes, you are quite likely to get infected.The best way to protect yourself is sticking to the basics i.e. washing your hands frequently. Yes, practising basic personal hygiene still remains the most effective method of prevention in this battle against the epidemic. It is important to understand that washing your hands with soap and water and using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer isn’t one and the same thing.According to experts, hand sanitizers are not able to get rid of stomach bug norovirus and the bacteria causing the C. difficile infection. On the contrary, handwashing not only actually kills the germs but it also removes dirt and grime which can make you sick. So, make it a point to only use hand sanitizer when you cannot get your hands to a clean water supply and soap. However, at the same time, it is important to wash your hands properly to get rid of all the pathogens. Here is a step-by-step guide on how you should wash your hands thoroughly to prevent the spread of infections1. Wet your hands with clean, running water. Use your elbow to turn off the tap as touching it with your hands may increase the risk of contamination.2. Lather up your hands and fingers with soap.3. Be sure to lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.4. It is important to rub your hands together for at least 20 seconds, as it creates friction which helps in getting rid of dirt, grease, and microbes from skin.5. As a rule of thumb, hum the “happy birthday song” from start to finish twice to time how long you should wash your hands.6. After you are done scrubbing, wash your hands with clean, running water.7 Dry your hands using a single-use clean towel or air-dry them.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74454755,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1011858/74454755.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/health-news/coronavirus-prevention-what-is-your-best-defence-against-covid-19/articleshow/74454755.cms

MUMBAI: A special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act court on Tuesday convicted and sentenced a 30-year-old man to 15 years of imprisonment for sexually assaulting two seven-year-old girls in 2017. The accused, Vijay Shaha, was caught redhanded by a man who saw him assault one of the two girls.

Among the witnesses examined by special public prosecutor, VD More, were the two minors who deposed in August 2019. The mother of one of the girls, who also deposed, told the court she ran a tiffin service and Shaha was her customer.

The eyewitness had told the police he worked as a watchman in a cement godown and used to be stationed in the parking area. He said on October 29, 2017, he

MUMBAI: The Bombay HC on Tuesday admitted a flyer's appeal against his conviction for sexual assault of a child actor in mid-air, suspended the sentence and continued his bail.

When the appeal by Vikas Sachdeva, a former senior executive of an entertainment firm, came up before Justice Prithviraj Chavan, he granted bail of Rs 25,000 with two sureties of like amount, but directed him not to leave the city without court permission.

""There is no scope of the appeal being heard and decided in the near future and since the sentence imposed is short, it stands suspended,"" the HC said.

On January 15, special trial court judge A D Deo had held Sachdeva, 41, guilty under Section 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. He had been accused of putting up his foot and touching the 17-year-old co-passenger, sitting ahead of him in the business class, on her shoulder and neck on a flight from Delhi to Mumbai in December 2017. Relying on the complainant's deposition, the judge had convicted Sachdeva and sentenced him to three years' imprisonment. He was granted bail.

On Tuesday, Justice Chavan asked why the Pocso victim be disbelieved. Sachdeva's counsel Aniket Nikam argued there was ""no independent evidence"" to support her case and that her deposition was ""shrouded in omissions and improvements"".

463,['4/03/2020'],NCLT clears NBCC offer for Jaypee Infratech,"Jaypee Infratech still has to deliver apartments, plots and villas to nearly 21,000 homebuyers (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The National Company Law Tribunal on Tuesday approved NBCC ’s offer to take over Jaypee Infratech , which has to deliver apartments, plots and villas to nearly 21,000 homebuyers.

NCLT’s principal bench, headed by acting president BSV Prakash Kumar, approved the PSU’s proposal to take over the company, along with the Taj Expressway, with certain conditions. The details would be known once the written order is issued.

The tribunal ruled the Rs 750-crore deposited by JIL’s promoter Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL) with the Supreme Court registry will be returned to JIL and be part of the resolution plan.

Jaypee buyers hope NBCC will stick to 2024 deadline

It makes more attractive proposition for NBCC. Last week, the apex court had ruled that 858 acres of JIL land was wrongfully mortgaged by JAL to secure its bank loans.

The NCLT ruling came just ahead of the expiry of the SC deadline for deciding on the case that has been through various legal forums since the government and RBI ordered insolvency proceedings against 12 high-profile companies, including JIL, in August 2017.

Government sources, who have been closely monitoring the case given the massive public interest, said it could take a few months for final commencement of work on the ground as any of the parties in the long-drawn legal battle can appeal against the NCLT ruling in the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal or SC.

Homebuyers, some of whom have been waiting to get their apartments for a decade, were elated by the decision and hoped that NBCC could stick to the schedule and complete construction by mid-2024.

For the government too, it has been an arduous battle with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman stepping in a few months ago with the corporate affairs and urban development ministries joining hands to ensure that NBCC came on board, while the lenders and UP government agencies were also on the same page.

VISAKHAPATNAM: Following reports of a person having tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) in Hyderabad, the Andhra Pradesh public transport department and the railways are on high alert. Health authorities have noted that since the virus can be transmitted upon direct contact, it is necessary to be vigilant on the public transport front.

On February 20, a techie arrived in Bengaluru and subsequently journeyed to Hyderabad on a bus on February 22. On being tested positive for the virus, he has been placed under observation at a government-run hospital. Telangana government is also on high alert.

Speaking to TOI, Ravi Kumar, executive director of the public transport department said that the department has started taking precautionary measures to spread information about COVID-19.

He added that posters about the disease have been pasted on buses going to and arriving from Hyderabad. He informed that the public transport department runs nearly 100 buses along the route, along with those that run between Visakhapatnam and Hyderabad. Nearly 3,000 passengers commute between Hyderabad and the Visakhapatnam region every day.

Health authorities have also instructed operators of private buses to track the health of passengers before they board the buses in Hyderabad.

The Railways is also on alert. Authorities informed that around 25 trains move between Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam daily. The most popular trains among these are Godavari Express, Garibrath, Duronto and Visakha Express.

“We have received orders to track the health of passengers at railway stations. Passengers coming from Hyderabad to stations in Andhra Pradesh should ideally wear masks and avoid direct contact with people,” said a railway official.

Meanwhile, 11 people have been tested for the virus in Andhra Pradesh yet, five of them from Visakhapatnam.

A 26-year-old man who was under observation at Government Chest Hospital was released on Tuesday. He had reportedly visited South Korea a few days ago. All 11 people have tested negative for the virus, including the 26-year-old.

465,['4/03/2020'],Mumbai's Shivaji Park exempted from parking fines,"TimesView The BMC cannot have different sets of rules for different areas of the city. The change in parking fine rules for Shivaji Park is a clear case of discrimination, and regardless of the reasons for the move — political exigency or public pressure — it must either be reversed at the earliest or the fines uniformly slashed across Mumbai so that the residents of other localities don't suffer merely on account of their addresses.

Parking pardon: BMC cites locals, but politics may be behind move

MUMBAI: In two questionable decisions that largely favour residents of Shivaji Park, the BMC has dropped parking penalties and allowed vehicles to be stationed on 15 roads that were designated no-parking till now.Last July, the BMC imposed Rs 5,000-23,000 penalties for parking on the road in a spot within 500 metres of a public parking lot (PPL). The policy, which was for the entire city, was modified in January, where the penalty was no longer a flat charge based on vehicle type, but a calculation that was 40 times the parking charge levied by the PPL near which a vehicle would be found.Now, for Shivaji Park, the BMC has dropped penalties to zero from Rs 4,000— the fine for a four-wheeler (as per the January policy modification) based on the parking charge at Kohinoor PPL, the only PPL in Dadar (West). Similarly, parking on one side of 15 roads in the same area has been allowed; these roads were earlier earmarked as no-parking zones.Advocate Pradeep Havnur, who has argued a PIL on public parking, said the move amounts to discrimination and could be tested in court.Activist Anandini Thakoor, managing trustee, Khar Residents Association, said, “They should stick to the rule of not allowing parking near a PPL. If parking space is available close by, why should exemptions be given to park on certain roads, which will cause congestion?”Shivaji Park had stopped following the BMC’s parking policy around the time of the assembly poll campaign. But two days ago, municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi signed an order formally granting an exemption to the area.Additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu said, “There was a demand from residents and local political representatives to allow street parking near Kohinoor PPL. We have allowed it as there’s enough space on one side of a road. If residents near other PPLs make such a demand, we may consider their request too.”The issue may have a political angle. Dadar is considered to be a politically sensitive area, where the Sena wants to keep its splinter organization MNS out. The local corporator, Vishaka Raut, is from the Sena, which also controls the BMC house. Shivaji Park falls in G-North ward, which covers Prabhadevi, Dadar (West), Matunga (West) and Mahim (West), and which includes the Shiv Sena’s headquarters.During the assembly election campaign last year, MNS candidate Sandeep Deshpande had raised the parking issue. The Sena reacted immediately, asking the BMC to stop levying penalties for parking violations in the area. The BMC did not officially grant the area a policy exemption, but went slow and removed from around Kohinoor PPL signboards displaying parking fines. Soon, locals began parking their vehicles on the road.Justifying the exemption, G-North ward officer Kiran Dighavkar said, “Most buildings here don’t have parking space, and so there’s a demand for on-street parking.”The opposition has criticized the move. “This is selective. Did they conduct any study before taking such a decision? Did they take the Parking Authority into confidence?” asked Congress corporator Asif Zakaria, demanding answers.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74467196,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-198502,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbais-shivaji-park-exempted-from-parking-fines/articleshow/74467191.cms

469,['4/03/2020'],"It’s March &amp; forest dept yet to get Rs 1,373cr out of Rs 2,306cr","Nagpur: With over Rs1,373 crore still not released even as the last month of financial year 2019-20 has set in, state forest department is staring at huge budgeting blues.

According to sources, the overall plan outlay of the forest department for 2019-20 was Rs2,306 crore. Out of this, till date only Rs933 crore has been released, which is hardly 40% of the total budget. The funds pertain to all three wings — territorial, social forestry and wildlife.

Officials fear non-release of funds will hamper crucial forestry activities like plantation, protection, relocation, various social and welfare schemes, construction activity, contractor bills, labour payments among many others.

“The money has not been released despite proposals were submitted well in time. When the budget is announced, state releases part payment with which works are carried out. Over 93% of the amount released has already been spent and new instalment is awaited,” said sources.

“Last year, the state government had planted 33 crore saplings. These first-year plantations need more money for maintenance. If money is not released in time, the plantations will die. Secondly, nursery works have not been started yet, thus new plantation works cannot be taken up,” said a section of officials from the field.

A section of RFOs said, “The department doesn’t have money for petrol and diesel and hence patrolling has taken a hit. Besides, funds for fire line works have also not been released yet. The department, which till last year had no fund problem, is crying for funds now. We are back to square one.”

During the last BJP-Shiv Sena government, Sudhir Mungantiwar had both finance and forest ministries with him. Hence, the department never faced fund crunch.

According to sources, the cash-strapped Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is curtailing budgets of most of the departments to fulfil the promise of loan waiver to farmers. “If the money is not released in time, it will lapse,” said officials.

Under the MVA, finance ministry is with the NCP while forest is with Shiv Sena and revenue with Congress. “There seems to be lack of coordination between the three,” said senior forest officers.

The government funding includes budget for plan and non-plan outlay. While 60% plan budget money is awaited, of the Rs2,000 non-plan grants, 80% has been spent as it mostly includes salaries.

Senior officials with budget and planning department said they were hopeful to get the grants released soon. Forest minister Sanjay Rathod has talked to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for releasing Rs500 crore. There are indications the money will be released soon. If the funds get lapsed, we will seek it in supplementary demands.

Currently, only Kasturba hospital has an isolation ward in the city.The hospitals shortlisted are Hinduhridaysamrat Balasaheb Thackeray Trauma Care Hospital in Jogeshwari; Bhabha hospital in Bandra, Bhabha hospital in Kurla and Rajawadi in Ghatkopar. “The goal is to have over 500 isolation beds, including those in private hospitals. In case of an outbreak, there should be effective measures in place to contain the spread as the population density in Mumbai is high,” Kakani said.Among the other measures being taken by the municipal corporation include upgrading facilities in Kasturba, developing facilities at other locations by roping in more civic, state government and private hospitals.Kakani said the BMC has already started talks with two private hospitals. He said the third step would be to ensure adequate stock of medicine, material and protective gear, enough to last at least 10 days. “We have also issued a tender for long-term purchases so that we can procure material as and when we want,” he said, adding that finally if an outbreak does occur, the BMC would also focus on spreading awareness and information on combating the virus.The state had also told government medical colleges to be ready to set up isolation wards. “Isolation wards could be set up in district hospitals so that there are over 500 isolation beds to tackle an outbreak,” Dr Pradeep Awate, disease surveillance officer, state government, said.Awate was speaking at a discussion organised by the Observer Research Foundation on ‘Combating Coronavirus’. He said surveillance was being carried out at the district level where telephonic contact was made with travellers who had been to places under Covid-19 threat. “If they develop any symptoms, they are referred to isolation wards,” he said.He said 3,245 samples had been tested in the country so far and that many of these were repeat tests done after 15 days of quarantine. “In the last four days itself, 365 samples were tested,” he said.The BMC has also been tracking passengers who arrived from countries battling the virus outbreak. “Even if they are asymptomatic, we make a phone call to them for 14 days.

NIT Swimming Pool Members’ Association said so far they had to pay only a one-time registration fee but recently the operator started levying it without giving due notice or consultation. This move, it said, has hiked the annual fee by around Rs 850 from Rs 3,600 to Rs 4,484.

They said though a hike has been enforced, the operator is not providing any additional facility. NIT executive engineer DR Gaur referred the queries to private operator saying all powers now vest with the company and the civic agency could not interfere in maintenance or any other issue at the pool.

Association president Manmohan Bajpai said as per the company’s agreement with NIT, it could raise charges by 8% to 10% but only after following due procedure. “Every month an additional amount of Rs 200+18% GST is being levied in the name of registration which is actually meant to be one time. The operator says those having valid cards will not have to pay registration charge. On Sunday, a member was charged additional fee,” Bajpai said.

He added this was nothing but tariff hike through backdoor. The company director Savithav Nair agreed registration charge was a bone of contention and said it will be sorted out during a meeting with the pool users on Thursday.

Nair ruled out any tarrif hike as it would amount to breach of terms and condition of its contract with NIT. The director also said the revenue sharing model has changed from January and they can’t afford to leave users unhappy.

“They had called me and wanted to discuss the issue. Whatever problems they are facing, we can sit across the table and sort out. We have not hiked the charges. We are continuing with whatever charge NIT recommended. The issue is one-time registration charge. We need to check if NIT was waiving off or levying it on expired memberships,” he said.

“We have been operating the pool for the last 20 years. But now the style of operation has changed. Earlier, NIT was paying us for the upkeep while now we are paying the civic agency,” he said.

472,['4/03/2020'],"GB orders Thakur’s transfer, Mundhe seeks continuation","Nagpur: Yet another controversy has erupted between the ruling party BJP and municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe in the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC).

On February 20, the general body had ordered Mundhe to send back chief accounts and finance officer (CAFO) Mona Thakur to the state government with immediate effect. Though Mundhe wrote to the state government on Tuesday informing about the general body’s decision, he also requested Thakur’s continuation in the NMC.

NMC sources said that Mundhe requested Thakur’s continuation as she is preparing his budget for 2020-21. Already, Mundhe’s budget is late as he is preparing work-wise budget. Mundhe also reportedly stressed the need for Thakur’s continuation till new accounts and finance officer is appointed by the government.

Now, the ball is in the court of Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. MVA is already taking steps to take direct control over the NMC and also bring back Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) as planning authority for unauthorized areas of the city.

Thakur is known to be very strict when it comes to financial issues. Her decisions have irked ruling party leaders in the NMC many times. Hence, Dharampal Meshram, chairman of NMC’s legal consultative committee, raised the issue in the general body meeting on February 20.

Citing section 47 (2) of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporations (MMC) Act, Meshram said that any officer who earlier worked as CAFO in the NMC cannot occupy the same post later.

Thakur was CAFO in the NMC between June 15, 2017, and September 6, 2018. After assuming charge, Mundhe had requested the government and brought Thakur back on the same post on February 11. Accordingly, mayor Sandip Joshi had ordered Mundhe to relieve Thakur with immediate effect.

On Tuesday, Joshi wrote a letter to Mundhe asking further action in the case of orders given by him in the general body.

Meshram said, “It is expected that Mundhe should work as per the Act. He should also inform the government about provisions of the Act which do not permit Thakur to continue as CAFO.”

Meanwhile, Mundhe transferred Praful Farkase, OSD of standing committee chairman, as junior engineer at NMC Dhantoli zone. Farkase had prepared budget of standing committee chairpersons for the last 14 years.

After Mundhe’s budget, the standing committee chairman will have to prepare and present the budget. Without Farkase, the chairman is likely to face problems in preparing the budget.

477,['4/03/2020'],Why’s government averse to debate on riots if situation in Delhi is normal: Congress,"Leader of opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The Rajya Sabha was adjourned thrice and could not transact any business on Tuesday over the opposition’s demand for a debate on the recent riots in Delhi. Leader of opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad wondered aloud why the government was adopting double standards by claiming on one hand that the situation in Delhi was normal but insisting that a discussion could not be allowed at present.

Despite Om Birla’s warning on Tuesday morning — that any MP crossing to the other side would be suspended for the remainder of the session — the Lok Sabha witnessed dramatic scenes with Congress ’s Adhir Ranjan Choudhury rushing to the well to protest against transaction of legislative business.

The Speaker had tried to resolve the standoff when he met opposition leaders in the afternoon. Though non-Congress opposition parties seemed ambivalent, Choudhury is understood to have stuck to his guns. Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi sought to point out that the bill in question needed to be passed before March 31 as it had serious financial implications.

In the Rajya Sabha, Azad said, “All of us, whether in the opposition or government, condemn the incidents. That Delhi violence is talked about in foreign countries but not discussed even though Parliament is in session... is a little odd. We are not looking to confront the government. We are all saddened; the victims, be it from any community or religion, were fellow humans,” he said.

Leader of the House Thaawarchand Gehlot got up and said the government was ready for a discussion as per the schedule decided by the Rajya Sabha chairman.

In the LS, amid slogans of ‘Down, Down Amit Shah ’ and ‘Save our India’, opposition MPs tore up papers even as the Speaker allowed finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to introduce the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2020. Though the LS passed six clauses of the ‘Vivad se Vishwas’ tax resolution bill amid the din, it could not pass the bill because of the ruckus that followed. As Congress, TMC, SP and DMK MPs rushed to the well, BJP MP Locket Chatterjee attempted to prevent Chowdhury from moving towards the treasury benches. Amid the din, BJP and Congress MPs pushed one another while some were seen banging the swivel door leading to the secretary general’s desk.

NEW DELHI: Congress on Tuesday slammed the Modi government for riots in Delhi and attempting to “run away” from a debate on the communal conflagration that claimed 47 lives. Outside Parliament, leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the opposition disrupted Lok Sabha proceedings only to assert that riots in Delhi must be given top priority. “The government says we leave it to the Speaker, the Speaker says debate will happen after things will be normal. Now coming under pressure, they are saying it will be discussed after Holi. They are running away from debate,” Chowdhury said.

Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad , accompanied by parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi , told the media that the government was ready for a discussion on the issue on March 11, after the Holi break. “The reason is that Delhi is getting back to normal and any discussion on the issue in Parliament now can provoke sentiments... after Holi, the House can discuss the issue when things get back to normal,” he said.

482,['4/03/2020'],"No muscle-flexing in civic polls, TMC tells councillors","Kolkata: Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee does not want a repeat of the 2018 panchayat polls in the coming civic elections. Trinamool MP and number 2 in the party, Abhishek Banerjee, issued this warning to party councillors of Kolkata Municipal Corporation at a closed-door meeting held at Trinamool Bhavan on Tuesday. Election strategist Prashant Kishor was present at the meeting.

Learning it the hard way from the 2018 Bengal rural polls that affected Trinamool’s performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Abhishek wanted the councillors to avoid muscle-flexing during civic polls and risk the party’s prospects in the 2021 assembly polls.

According to Trinamool insiders, the party is way ahead in most of the 144 wards under KMC. Trinamool leaders held that there was no point taking a heavy-handed approach for a couple of more seats because such tactic offends public feeling.

Taking a cue from Mamata’s speech at Netaji Indoor Stadium on Monday, the Trinamool MP said that distribution of tickets will be based on performance of the councillors, their transparent public image and their ready contact with people.

Of the three parameters, Trinamool senior Subrata Mukherjee gave primacy to transparent image of councillors. Mukherjee cited the instance of Congress councillor Prakash Upadhyay, who defeated the TMC candidate in the last civic polls because of his “transparent image”.

Abhishek also referred to the tendency among a section of councillors to blackmail the party over ticket distribution. “Some seats have been reserved for women. Councillors who were elected from these seats are pressing for their candidates from the reserved ones. If someone wants to blackmail the party over ticket distribution, s/he can leave the party now. I will give you the bus fare to go straight to the BJP headquarters,” Abhishek said.

Team PK has already submitted a primary performance report of councillors to the Trinamool top brass. The report points to the falling public image of a section of councillors who couldn’t ensure transparent delivery of services, and at times misbehaved with people. Trinamool seniors will take this report into account among other things during selection of candidates.

The TMC top brass will hold another meeting with councillors after 15 days before finalising the candidate list for the KMC polls.

“Mamata Banerjee has said that transparent image, mass contact and performance will be the three criteria for selection of candidates. We discussed several organisational aspects before taking the plunge for the civic polls,” said Trinamool secretary general Partha Chatterjee.

TMC president Subrata Bakshi and Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim asked party organisers and councillors to start door-to-door campaigns to improve mass contact.

483,['4/03/2020'],"Coronavirus in Kolkata: ‘Novel’ experience for the tourists travelling from Kolkata, but doctors advise caution","KOLKATA: Tourists from Kolkata travelling in South-East Asian countries under the virus scare are having quite the ‘novel’ experience in more ways than one: rock-bottom prices and unbelievably low hotel tariffs, and even the most popular destinations wearing a deserted, almost unrecognisable, look. But even as several of them had pleasant vacations, doctors have warned that visiting these places is risky, and no precaution against nCoV could ever be fool-proof.“I have been to Bangkok on multiple occasions. But this time, it seemed as though I was visiting a different city,” said Satnam Singh Ahluwalia, a resident of New Alipore, who visited Bangkok last month with wife Gurbir Kaur. “The hustle and bustle of Bangkok was missing. The streets were deserted and the markets were empty, with just a handful of tourists window-shopping. Supermarkets and bars closed early and nearly everyone wore masks.” The couple also had tickets booked for a trip to Japan later this month, but has cancelled them in the wake of the nCoV outbreak Wearing masks or staying away from crowds, while being safe practices, did not ensure immunity from the virus, reminded doctors.“It’s advisable to wear masks or steer clear of crowds but even one infected person can give you the vir-us,” said Heart Foundation of India president K K Aggarwal. “Since it has spread to almost all SE Asian countries, particularly Thailand, chances of infection are high.”Heart Foundation of India president KK Aggarwal added that those who have travelled to the region should remain quarantined at home for at least 15 days since their return and consult a doctor if s/he has fever or cough. “Even if you are travelling in an aircraft with a couple of infected people, you may get the virus. So, it would be wrong to assume that a deserted Bangkok would be safer than a crowded one,” he warned.Financial communicator and social worker Mudar Patherya, who was also in Bangkok last week, received the shock of his life when he boarded the plane. The 180-seater aircraft flew near-empty on February 26, with just 23 passengers on board. “There was a lull all around. I learned the government had advised citizens to refrain from visiting crowded places. So, people were avoiding even public transport and many preferred to stay indoors,” Patherya told TOI.Thailand, incidentally, was the first country outside China to report a case of nCoV, on January 13. As of now, the country has recorded 43 confirmed cases.The beach resort of Phuket, Thailand’s second-most visited destination after Bangkok — remained deserted during the annual festival held last month on Walking Street in the heart of town.Railway engineer and Chetla resident Sanjay Prasad was in Bangkok with his wife and another couple last month. He said the nCoV scare had even made the famous street food disappear, both at Pattaya and on Bangkok’s Khao San Road. “Exotic meats like alligator, bat, snake and frog have gone off the menu. Although we were wary about trying out exotic items, we were surprised that stalls weren’t selling them, either,” said Prasad.The situation is similar at other South-East Asian tourist destinations like Vietnam, with places like the Literature Temple and Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum in Hanoi — often cited as the country’s two most popular tourist attractions — almost devoid of tourists. Nearly everyone around are wearing masks, either voluntarily or under duress, said tourists.“Two of my friends from Delhi had recently been to Hanoi, and they said it’s not safe to visit. So, I cancelled my tickets to Hanoi,” said Jadavpur resident Sayani Chaudhari, a freelance graphic artist.A senior official of Thai Airways, which has daily direct flights to Bangkok, said the number of passengers gradually decreased since the last week of January 20. The airline was still receiving ticket-refund requests, he added.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74467197,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-156824,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/novel-experience-for-tourists-but-doctors-advise-caution/articleshow/74466882.cms
484,['4/03/2020'],Polish student from JU moves HC over notice to leave India,"Kolkata: Kamil Siedcynski, the Polish student from Jadavpur University who has been asked to leave the country by the Foreigner Regional Registration Office ( FRRO ), has invoked principles highlighted in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966) that are applicable to all persons to challenge the order in Calcutta High Court. His petition is likely to be heard on Wednesday.

Siedcynski has also claimed in his petition that the FRRO order of February 14 was contrary to the principles of natural justice.

While the FRRO has found Siedcynski guilty of violating visa norms by participating in an anti-CAA protest, the student has claimed in his petition that he was inadvertently caught in the protest.

He has maintained that as a student with interest in Indian culture, he was merely watching the proceedings and had clicked photographs of the ‘carnival like’ proceedings from a sidewalk. A student of Warsaw University, Siedcynski, was selected by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations to study at Visva-Bharati University for the academic year 2016-17. After gaining knowledge in Bengali, Sanskrit and Hindi at Santiniketan, he opted for a full-time Masters Degree course in Comparative Literature from JU and was granted visa accordingly. This visa is valid till August 2020, when he is supposed to take his final exams.

According to his petition, Siedcynski had been persuaded by other students of JU to accompany them to the place near New Market for the protest on December 19. He apparently didn’t know what the protest meet was all about and soon got separated from his fellow students. Thereafter, he stood on the sidewalk watching the event and clicking photographs. He claimed there were other foreigners watching the protest as well and a person approached him wanting to know his name and views on the protest. The man also clicked his photograph after which he left for home. The next day, Siedcynski realised the man he had spoken to was a photojournalist and an article on him had appeared in a newspaper. He has claimed in his petition that much of what was written in the article was made-up.

He received a notice from the FRRO thereafter and was asked to leave the country on February 14.

Seeking an order from the high court allowing him to remain in the country, Siedcynski has challenged the FRRO notice calling it arbitrary, capricious and violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed to all persons by the Constitution.

487,['4/03/2020'],"After ‘Banglar Abas Yojana’, Didi unveils ‘Snehalaya’ housing plan","Kaliaganj: Direct benefit and prompt delivery have proved to be the two building blocks of Trinamool Congress’s success in this Uttar Dinajpur constituency in the assembly bypoll in November despite BJP’s overall gain in north Bengal in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

So, at a time PM Narendra Modi is thinking of leaving social media, Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is making effective use of the ‘Didi Ke Bolo’ campaign to establish direct link with the impoverished, who usually get waylaid in between. Banerjee has carved out the Snehalaya housing plan for those 25,000 people whose wish for home reached the CM’s grievance cell.

“The Snehalaya scheme is a new scheme other than the existing Banglar Abas Yojana. As many as 25,000 people appealed to me via the CM’s grievance cell urging for a dwelling unit. I checked the applications and found that many of them do not fit into the ‘Banglar Abas Yojana’. I have, therefore, taken up this new scheme to make their dream come true,” Banerjee said at a public meeting in Kaliaganj on Tuesday.

The state government has also sanctioned a total 5 lakh applications from people mainly from Dalits, Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities, granting to senior citizens a monthly pension of Rs 1,000 less than a month after the scheme was announced in the state Budget. “The money will be credited directly to your accounts,” the CM said.

Banerjee also assured the SC community and Adivasis that her government has simplified the caste certificate delivery process. “Now, the government will issue caste certificate to applicants without inquiry if one among the family has a caste certificate,” she said.

The CM also announced that her government has regularised another 119 refugee colonies, giving land pattas that will help them establish their citizenship.

“All of you have voter cards or job cards or land pattas and an address. You are all citizens. There is no need for a fresh citizenship law. Those who have come from Bangladesh are all citizens. Don’t rely on those who are trying to divide people,” she said.

Banerjee reminded the people of north Bengal how the BJP pandered to Rajbanshi sentiments ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. “They (BJP) told the Rajbanshis that they will stay in Cooch Behar, the Bengalis have to go. Months later, during the Assam NRC exercise, Rajbanshis along with Bengalis took the hit. We want food, not division. We want jobs, not riots,” the chief minister said.

489,['4/03/2020'],‘IndiGo to replace remaining 60 P&amp;W engines by May 31’,"NEW DELHI: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Tuesday said it has received a firm schedule that IndiGo’s remaining 60 unmodified Pratt & Whitney (PW) engines will be replaced within the deadline and the schedule for replacing GoAir’s remaining 32 unmodified PW engines is still awaited. IndiGo and GoAir currently have 92 unmodified PW engines on their Airbus A320 Neos that need to be replaced with modified ones by May 31, 2020, to keep flying after that.In all, IndiGo and GoAir were to get 180 modified engines both as replacement on planes already in their fleet and on new A320/321 Neos delivered to them by May-end. While about 90 of the modified engines were to come as new deliveries and replacement by February-end, the remaining half is expected by May 31. IndiGo at present has 106 Neos and GoAir has 43. Together the two Indian carriers have about 25% of the 585 A320 Neo family aircraft with PW 1100 series engines operating globally, a senior DGCA official said.“A total number of 56 (PW unmodified engine) failures (on A320 Neos) have been reported globally, out of which 26 failures — 22 by IndiGo and four by GoAir — have been reported by Indian carriers, amounting to about 46%,” the official said.“IndiGo got its first A320 Neo in March 2016 and GoAir its first in May 2016… Post induction of the aircraft into service, technical issues were experienced on these engines worldwide. Most of these issues have been suitably addressed by the manufacturer except third-stage low pressure turbine (LPT) failures… PW developed a more robust third-stage LPT which was installed on new engines from June 2019,” said the official.“PW is in the process of setting up an MRO (maintenance repair overhaul) in India in collaboration with Air India (engineering arm) for replacement of third-stage LPT at (the latter’s) Mumbai facility. This will significantly reduce the time taken for the upgrade. The facility was supposed to be operational by the end of February 2020,” the official added.“DGCA is continuously monitoring the performance of these engines and taking appropriate action to address the issues. The manufacturer has been directed to ensure sufficient availability of spare engines for Indian operators to prevent grounding of aircraft due to removal of engines,” he added.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74467360,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-147557,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/indigo-to-replace-remaining-60-pw-engines-by-may-31/articleshow/74467317.cms
490,['4/03/2020'],Chennai suburbs to get 55 new parks in nine months,"With these new ones, the total number of parks in Chennai will go up to 700.

CHENNAI: In a big boost to the city’s lung space, the corporation has planned to set up 55 new parks across the extended areas. Most of these parks will come up in places such as Perungudi, Sholinganallur, Madipakkam and Madhavaram within the next nine months, say officials.

Two new playgrounds will also come up at Semmenchery and Asirvathapuram.

While the playground in Semmenchery will be a multipurpose facility with a running track, badminton court and gym, major retrofitting will be done to the existing playground in Asirvathapuram. The estimated cost of the project is ₹52 crore.

“We have already identified open space reservation (OSR) land parcels for the 55 parks and tenders have been floated,” said an official with the parks and playgrounds department of the corporation.

OSR land areas are those that are reserved for recreational use by communities as a whole before approval of layouts under the state Town and Country Planning Act.

With these new ones, the total number of parks in the city will go up to 700.

“Such green spaces are important for the general wellbeing of the people. We are also looking for public-private partnership to maintain and develop larger parks,” said an engineer with the parks department. The engineer also said that in areas where public cooperation is minimal, anti-social elements tend to take control of the parks.

Parks asked to take sewage from nearby residential colonies

The civic body is also particular about the maintenance of these parks, which are most likely to be handed over to private contractors after inception. Maintenace of 554 parks in the city has been outsourced and the remaining ones are maintained by the civic body’s own staff and some by private companies and resident welfare associations.

In a meeting held with the contractors more than a month ago, the corporation commissioner had instructed the contractors to ensure that even minor repair works at the parks should be completed quickly and that the contractors should hold monthly review meetings to monitor their upkeep.

Parks have been asked to take sewage water from nearby residential colonies, treat them and use it for watering plants. To ensure proper security, contractors have been asked to build a separate room for security staff and ensure that only able-bodied staff are employed as security.

Contractors were also told to ensure that composting of wet waste be carried out in all parks and the manure obtained be used for trees and plants.

491,['4/03/2020'],Gangster Gogi: How this Delhi gangster was caught four years after escape,"NEW DELHI: Bringing down the curtain on a four-year chase since the audacious escape of Delhi's most-wanted gangster, Jitender Maan alias Gogi, from custody, Delhi Police's Special Cell arrested him and three of his associates from Gurugram on early Tuesday.As the cell tracked them down to a flat in Mapsko Casabella in Sector 82, Gogi, who is known for opening fire at cops on the slightest pretext, acted differently. He went live on Facebook and released a video saying he was surrendering, and then opened the door and walked towards the police cordon.While Gogi (29) was at the top of the most-wanted list, two others - Kuldeep Fajja (28) and Rohit Moi (27) - also featured among Delhi Police's top 10 criminals. The fourth has been identified as Kaplil (27) from Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh. While Gogi is from Outer Delhi's Alipur, Fajja belongs to Naya Baans in the same area and Moi to Haryana's Sonipat.The list of their prominent crimes include the murder of Haryana's folk singer, Harshita Dahiya, in Sonipat and a gang war in Burari in 2018. Just a fortnight ago, the gang shot at a rival over 50 times in Kanjhawala and hit him 24 times.The counter-intelligence (CI) unit under inspector Vikram Dahiya was tracking the gang since last December. Gogi, a source said, was left without any major target after his arch rival, Amit Dabang, was nabbed in January-end. ""Utilising all resources, suspect persons and locations were put under surveillance,"" said Manishi Chandra, DCP of the unit.The gang used social media not only to communicate among themselves but also to extort people. Cops managed to identify some of these Facebook IDs, said a source. The Facebook surveillance yielded some crucial internet protocol addresses and eventually their physical locations.Sources were deployed at Kherki Daula toll plaza after some movements were recorded on this route. Finally, the team was tipped off about the gang's presence in the Gurugram society. ""As it was an upscale residential condominium, elite SWAT commandos, expert in urban building intervention, were called to assist the raiding party,"" Chandra said.After the gang, occupying an apartment on the second floor of B4 block, were asked to surrender, there was no response from Gogi and his men for almost 20 minutes. However, a source claimed, they didn't find any escape route and surrendered.Sx imported pistols of Zigana, Taurus and Star make, and over 70 live cartridges were found on them. A Hyundai i-20 car, lifted from Paschim Vihar, was also seized.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74467356,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-230910,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-gangster-held-four-years-after-escape/articleshow/74467334.cms
492,['4/03/2020'],West Bengal to procure robots to fight along with firemen in critical cases,"KOLKATA: The state fire department will soon have robots in its squad to flight alongside firemen. It is in an advanced stage of acquisition of four such robots, which will be used in situations like extreme heat, suffocating smoke and possibility of explosion. With this addition, Bengal will be the first fighting unit in the eastern region to have robots.If everything goes according to the plan, the robots will be pressed into service in this March itself. Sources said these robots will help in fighting devastating chemical fire like Bagri Market with much greater efficacy.“Since our chief minister Mamata Banerjee accorded highest importance in safeguarding people’s life and property, we are trying fast to complete the tender procedure and acquire them. These robots will certainly be a game-changer in fire-fighting. Bengal will be the first fire-brigade in the eastern region to attain this level of modernisation,” said Sujit Bose, minister of state for fire and emergency services (independent charge).The decision of acquiring robot was taken after a delayed success in containing the fire at Bagri Market. It was induced by chemicals stockpiled by traders and also many places remained inaccessible because of the intense heat and toxic fume. The fire fighters fought an unequal battle to contain he fire.“In such cases, robots will be an ideal solution. They have inbuilt motors to throw water or foam at such a speed that even a chemical fire can be put out really fast. We will not only save lives of firefighters, but will also help in dousing the flames in shortest possible time,” said Jag Mohan, director general, fire service.These robots are designed to fight the most hazardous fires. Made with fire and heat-resistant materials, these robots are remote controlled. “They can reach the seat of the fire and extinguish it most effectively,” said additional director general Niladri Chakraborty.Since these robots are fitted with sensors and has ability to capture thermal imagery, it will give us live report of actual intensity and extent of the fire. This would also help us to adopt a correct firefighting strategy. They can carry out critical tasks of extinguishing systems in buildings and automatically move to the source of fire to carry out the initial fire extinguishing process until the fire fighters reach the spot.The gadgets can also be used to carry out awareness drives in malls. The robot will be subject to a trial period of three months and then evaluated to determine its technical and operational efficiency, said an officer.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74467352,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-215640,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/west-bengal-to-procure-robots-to-fight-along-with-firemen-in-critical-cases/articleshow/74467339.cms

Zaiwalla was in India for the launch of his memoir, ‘Honour Bound’. Singhvi also referred to the interview given by Zaiwalla to TOI “through which he had deliberately compounded the felony”. “We demand that the book titled ‘Honour Bound’ be recalled forthwith by you and defamatory portions of the book deleted ...
