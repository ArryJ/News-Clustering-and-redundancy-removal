The joy of eating out, especially from a popular road-side vendor, is indescribable. There is something about digging into a plate of piping hot gobi manchurian or trying one of the 99 varieties of dosas, etc. Eating at a road-side outlet is when we, most often, overlook hygiene and give in to cravings. But now is not a good time for that, what with Bengaluru battling cholera and COVID-19 scares simultaneously.In the last two weeks, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahangara Palike officials have been cracking down on street vendors who have not been following basic hygiene norms, following a surge in gastro-intestinal disease cases in the city.

1,['22/03/2020'],When my friend dumped me,"I have often spoken about cutting out people from my life, and actively support this form of cleansing. I believe it’s cutting out toxicity. However, I did not think I would be the person who would be at the receiving end of this.I have sat down with friends and told them exactly who has been holding them back in life, who is bringing inthe toxicity and who needs to go.I have done this for myself as well.I was always that reliable person to whom people came for sound advice, especially when it came to relationships.I felt I had gone through a lot pretty early in life and had a very practical, empathetic and mature outlook. But I did not know everything. No one does, and that isthe learning curve in life that everyone talks about – the things we accept we don’t know.I was pretty fond of this school friend of mine. She was cool, witty and caring, all at the same time. I was in love with her. Since life takes an unknown turn every now and then, I couldn’t maintain my closeness with her. We still met a handful of times a year. On birthdays, important dates and festive holidays.I thought everything was okay. Once college got over and both of us started working, we had time to take out for each other. However, everytime we met, she would comment on how I was intrusive and had a strong opinion on other people’s lives. Maybe I did, I didn’t make much of it.Then those comments just became two words: Aunty Acid.I don’t even know what she meant and a Google search of what it meant was of no help. I did get offended but would choose not to react. I let it all pass, until one day both of us got into a huge fight, in the middle of a buffet breakfast at a hotel.I thought things would fall into place in time. It’s been two years since that fight and I haven’t heard from her. She, just like me, spoke about letting go of people who did not “feed the soul”. I just didn’t think I was one of them. She removed me from her social media, and till date avoids events where she knows I might show up.She’s blocked me off WhatsApp too. I was over that fight after a week or so and tried to get her to talk to me, but clearly life is not a wish granting machine.She thought that I was overbearing and annoying because of my habit of telling people what to do. Now that I think of it, she had her reasons to dislike me. I was trying too hard to hold on to that last straw of our friendship. She wanted out and she took the first option she got.Was I hurt? Yes. Did I forgive her? Yes. Did I understand her reason? No.Friendships can’t be forced and I should have known. I did not need a wake up call, it was more like... this happens to people around you, you have done this to your own friends, so you are at as much risk as anyone else to be cut out. I was toxic and I still cannot come around to the fact that it happened to me. I hold my friend in high regard, wherever she is. But I too now do not wish for her to be a part of my life anymore.“This happens to people around you, you have done this to your own friends, so you are at as much risk as anyone else to be cut out.

Why water conservation

is an urgent necessity

The average water availability in India is just 100 litres per person a day (lpcd), as opposed to the prescribed standard of 135 lpcd. Of this, nearly 30% water is used for flushing and about 50% is used for bathing, washing and cleaning.

The amount of water used in standard fixtures

Taps: 10-18 litres/minute depending on

the pressure

Showers: 10-25 litres/minute

Toilets: Single-flush toilets use 10-13 litres/flush

4,['22/03/2020'],The lure of chikankari,"If spring-summer had a fashion avatar it would probably be a chikankari kurta. The lightweight, delicate — usually floral embroidery — in white thread on a light airy pastel-hued fabric is what summer dreams are made of. As the temperature soars, chic chikans come marching out. And this year it goes beyond the kurta. From sarees to festivewear and bustier tops to pants – chikan is everywhere. Designers are constantly adding new stitches and fabrics to keep the age-old embroidery up-to-date. Creative director of House of Kotwara, Sama Ali, says that chikankari originated to ease the hot summer of India and it was traditionally done on fine cotton for a variety of silhouettes. “Now with modernisations of various ethnic crafts, one can find chikankari on swimwear cover ups,” she says. Its soft and subtle tone-on-tone embroidery translates well on easy-breezy ensembles.MANISH MALHOTRA; INSTAGRAM@KANIKAKAPOOR_HOUSEOFCHIKANKARIChikan literally translates to embroidery, and is typical to Lucknow, so much so that Geographical Indication Registry has accorded the craft Geographical Indication (GI) status in December 2008. Ali feels that it’s because of cooperatives like Sewa and Mijwan, chikankari continues to be relevant. “There’s constant innovation of the craft itself as seen in our collections and works by Abu Jani-Sandeep Khosla and Rahul Mishra. Over the years, chikan has moved beyond cotton to other fabrics such as organza, georgette, silk and has also been utilised in bridal outfits and western silhouettes. The possibilities are endless, as we see a fusion of different motifs and techniques,” she adds.ANJUL BHANDARIDesigner Anjul Bhandari who has been working with chikankari extensively and uses it to create a heavily embellished festivewear calls it elegant and graceful. “It works very well on pastels and light fabrics like muslin, linen, georgette, chiffon and cotton which are the ideal fabrics for this weather,” she notes. Bhandari has developed new motifs which are feminine, modern and even geometric. Using signature highlights like Japanese baby pearls, baby mirrors and sequins and zardozi and gold and silver beads, the ensembles are made to look bride ready.Chikankari’s core technique works well with modern or western silhouettes from gowns to skirts and capes. Bhandari suggests adding elements to make the embroidery stand out more. For Ali, it’s the constant dilution and wrong representation of chikankari that has affected the craft negatively.NOORKARI CHIKANKARIChikankari consists of 32 techniques and what we see is mostly keel or jaali work – and it’s more intricate and versatile than that. Ali says that the original handmade chikan is a long and laborious process. “Being a price sensitive market, people are now focusing on the cost than the quality that has a detrimental effect on the authenticity of contemporary chikankari,” she notes. Bhandari insists on buying from a verified genuine source and thanks to being geo-tagged, only chikankari from Lucknow or the Awadh region is authentic. She adds, “If you can buy chikankari, think about it as an investment rather than just any purchase. You are investing in heritage.”1. PRAMA BY PRATIMAA PANDEY2.

5,['22/03/2020'],Change of diet or mindset?,"Which one will you choose? Mindset 1: This food will make me fat and sick.Mindset 2: Whatever I eat is healing and nourishing for my body.Mindset matters. Your mind is a powerful tool and it can either be your best asset or your worst enemy. There is continuous communication between your body and your mind. What your mind thinks, envisions and sees, it accordingly sends an indication to your body and your body responds to the indication by manifesting every one of those thoughts.If you are the one with Mindset 1, and label a particular food as “fattening”, then that is exactly how it is going to be for you. On the contrary, if you are the one with Mindset 2, label it as “healing” or “nourishing”, then it will behave that way.When clients come to us with their health concerns, even before getting them started with our protocol, the first thing we ask them is whether they believe they will be fine or not. If the answer is yes, then we know they are on right path. However, if they say “no”, we know a lot of time and effort has to be spent on coaching the client’s mindset.A mindset change came come in the form of ‘hope’ too. Today, people spend so much money around cancer treatment, fly across the world, get hold of top doctors, nutritionists for dietary changes, change water filters, include superfoods, new treatments like immunology, immunotherapy and do every single thing needed but do not practice and give HOPE to people with cancer affirming that cancer doesn’t mean the end of life and that there is a possibility of living life undeniably normally.Take another example. While so many people going through chemotherapy and radiation experience side effects that they dread, many don’t even know what these side effects are and walk out of hospitals with zero side effects, full of energy and some even resuming work right after a radiation of chemo session. Same drug, same cancer but different outcomes. Of course, everyone is different (in terms of their state of mind, genes, stage of disease), but keeping a strong mindset is key. What you believe, so shall it be. The moment a person starts to give up from the mind, the body soon starts giving up too. Without the right mindset, we cannot heal. Instead, we lock our own success with poor mindsets.Having said that, it isn’t realistic to have a positive mindset always. We are humans and it’s natural to go through negative feelings. Real freedom is when you can take yourself away from your own prison and trap of self-limiting beliefs and mistaken mindsets. Your body achieves what your mind believes.There are more than 60,000 thoughts that pass our mind every single day, but we can at least try to be more aware of when our mind starts to slip towards negative thoughts and use certain techniques like positive visualisations, positive affirmations, meditation, praying and practicing hope.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74724404,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-32706/74724404.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/diet/change-of-diet-or-mindset/articleshow/74724404.cms
6,['22/03/2020'],The mystery around Amala Paul’s ‘marriage’,"During the promotions of her film Aadai, Amala Paul has revealed that she was in a relationship, but did not disclose the identity of her partner. Industry insiders speculated that the actress was in a live-in relationship with Mumbai-based singer Bhavninder Singh . Adding weight to these speculations, the singer had come on board as a co-producer for Cadaver, a film that marks the actress’ debut as a producer, and had also begun to handle her work commitments. The two were also frequently posting pictures of each other on their Instagram pages as well.On Friday, a few pictures that showed the two taking part in a marriage ceremony were posted on Bhavninder’s Instagram account. The singer had captioned the pictures with the hashtag #throwback. Another Instagram profile, named Brian Siddhartha Ingle, too, had uploaded these pictures and posted, “Some beautiful wedding pics of my friends Amala & Bhuvi during these difficult times.”The pics soon went viral, with many speculating that Amala had married Bhavninder in a private ceremony some time ago. But interestingly, as soon as the pics started trending, Bhavninder, who had a public profile, deleted his post and a few hours later, also made his profile a private one. Brian, too, has deleted them from his page.While we tried reaching out to Amala to get her version of this story, her publicists stated that they weren’t aware of a wedding. Another source told us that Amala and Bhavninder had met through a common friend, and had dated each other, but have now broken up. Lending credibility to this version is the fact that the actress has unfollowed the singer on her Instagram page.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74747600,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-886955/74747600.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/the-mystery-around-amala-pauls-marriage/articleshow/74747600.cms
7,['22/03/2020'],#CoronaCrisis: A treat to beat #JantaCurfew from artiste fraternity,"The Carnatic musicians’ and the performing artistes’ communities have come out in support at this hour of #CoronaCrisis in a unique manner, to make Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s #JantaCurfew a success, and to urge people to stay at home all through today. They will be coming together under an online umbrella of #JanathaCurfewOnlineFestival, and live-streaming concerts, as well as sharing, recorded concerts of eminent artistes. They will keep this going from 8am to 5pm, the time when the PM has urged everyone to come out on their balconies and make some noise.“This will keep everyone interested in arts and music , young and old alike, engaged, and will help kill boredom. People can sing along from their homes, with their families,” says Carnatic pianist, Anil Srinivasan, who’s spearheading this on his Facebook page and is currently busy collating a list and schedules of about 130 participants who’ve already given their consent.Among them is Carnatic vocalist Sudha Raghunathan. “We are living in denial. Let’s lace-up, be responsible and stay put. Let’s learn self-control and understand the seriousness of the situation,” says Sudha, and adds, “I have a live-streaming of my own music from 8.30am to 9am — I have chosen this time as many Indians in the US indicated they would love to be a part of this initiative, and said this is a comfortable timeframe for them.” She intends to start her FB live with a message on ‘What we should do and what we shouldn’t be doing’.“I’ve named this session Sowkiyam — it means ‘all is well’ in English. I wish all is well soon,” says Sudha, who will also share her recorded concerts and messages for the #JanathaCurfewOnlineFestival all through the day.“I am doing my live-streaming at 9am,” informs Anil, “And again, maybe, in the afternoon at around 3pm. I must slot all those who’ve agreed to be a part of this — already around 130 musicians, well-known and upcoming, have said they want to participate. It would be a great platform for upcoming talent to be seen and heard as well. If we can create multiple engagement opportunities for people on that day, we’re hoping they’d stay at home — we’re readily giving you 100 to 150-odd performances to listen to on your phone from where you are sitting. Isn’t it a great incentive?” asks Anil.“It’s just that all of us will be at home, so I wanted to spread some love through music and support for humanity,” says singer Srinivas, also a participant, “I will come live at some point of time and sing some songs, say some good things. All of us will be solo. It’s not right to get anyone to travel, so there are no accompanists.”The list includes well-known names such as Bombay Jayashri, Rajhesh Vaidhya and Anita Ratnam, who’ll be sending recorded pieces, “and an ever-growing list of live participants,” adds Anil. “Many artistes have experienced disturbances in their concert schedules because of this Coronavirus pandemic. So, a lot of creative energy is sitting worried and idle. This can be a good outlet for them, too. Participation needs only filling up an online form,” he says.“This doesn’t require a lot of tech support — even amateurs can join us. The intent is to keep this going till 5pm. I am not an organiser or anything; we are all participants, all I am going to do is cross post everything that the participants put up on their own FB or Insta pages and tag us. Tag and share are the keywords here. Yes, like for every initiative, there are naysayers, too. But our priority is health — let’s allow the process to happen, let’s spread love; it not the time for fights, political, or otherwise,” concludes Anil.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74747643,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1244561/74747643.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/music/coronacrisis-a-treat-to-beat-jantacurfew-from-artiste-fraternity/articleshow/74747643.cms

When we headed to Thailand, we had no idea about the coronavirus. In fact, the initial plan was to shoot the song as a montage.

By helping the body remove excess sodium, potassium plays a vital role in reducing blood pressure. Messages between your brain and the body are delivered in the form of nerve impulses. These impulses regulate your heartbeat, muscle contractions, reflexes and many other physiological functions. Potassium, by virtue of being classified as an electrolyte, plays a significant role in the activation of these nerve impulses throughout our nervous system. Additionally, it also helps protect against stroke, osteoporosis, kidney stones and helps regulate fluid balance in the body.Natural, unprocessed salt as compared to white or refined salt.

12,['22/03/2020'],The rise of fashion DIY 2.0,"Everyone has a signature style, and it hasn’t been more evident as it’s right now. Courtesy social media, bloggers, influencers, celebs, flaunting innumerable looks — from ramps, Insta profiles to airports — Gen Now has grown up looking at fashion as a way to display their signature style. About a few decades ago, people spent a significant amount of time — say the whole of their 20s — trying to figure out what their personal style was; now, you have teens, young adults as well as adults, flaunting their style with panache.Look around you. Almost everyone is personalising sarees and salwar kameez, westernwear and every attire in between. We’ve moved past the fast fashion overdose of the ’90s, when you either found people choosing either Western or Indian. Those were the days where fashion designers and glossies, not to forget Bollywood, dictated style choices.(Left to right: Fashion influencer Nilu Yuleena Thapa wears a sheer organza jacket with a tiger-print skirt, Influencer & YouTuber Roshni Bhatia flaunts her lilac turban and dress)Today, everyone is his or her own brand. Designer Raghavendra Rathore believes style these days is “all about curating an experience” for yourself, all the while collectively pushing the frontier of fashion towards a slow movement. Hence, we are seeing youngsters coupling their mother’s old saree with an uber chic tee, and making the look rock.Fashion brands have globally become aware of this trend. A study by Deloitte finds that though the one-size-fits-all approach by luxury brands worked for a few decades, such a strategy does not resonate with the changing consumer base. About 45 per cent of respondents actually preferred personalised products and services.Gucci has recently preselected a section in many stores, where DIY-ers can choose to put their desired patch, initials or embroidery. Says fashion designer Shivan Bhatiya of Shivan & Narresh, “People, in general, love the concept of owning something exclusively. Millennials reflect their true personality with the way they style themselves. For instance, hand-painted denim jackets and customised T-shirts are currently a raging trend. It’s this idea of being able to express yourself in your attire that has popularised fashion DIY 2.0.”Rathore adds, “Social media is the new consciousness, and the platform where new trends emerge from. The runways and glossies are passe. The ability to tap into anybody’s style universe via social media — with an insight into their thought pattern — is changing fashion as we knew it.”(Left to right: Fashion blogger Mamta Sharma Das displays a knotted saree look, YouTuber Komal Pandey makes a statement with a choker, floral top and a side-slit skirt, Lawyer-turned-influencer Karron S Dhinggra belts up his suit to make a personal style statement)Personalisation has been a growing phenomenon for a while now in the West, with brands from Ralph Lauren to Burberry to Nike and Fendi, offering customised tweaking for patrons. It’s happening in India too for a while now. Fashion blogger Mamta Sharma Das (@thebohobaalika on Insta) loves experimenting with clothes. She says, “People now want to follow people with realistic fashion sense, someone they can relate to. I analysed what made me different and focused on that rather than copying others. I think it’s vital to let your personality shine through and keep the style breezy – looks that will work both casually and at work. The style should be easy to achieve too.”(Artist blogger Neha Sahai wears a bralet blouse with her saree)This is the Age of Assertiveness led by a very confident generation. For them, creativity doesn’t begin and end with the established industry trends. This generation is guiding itself to new heights of fashion, wearing their own ideas with confidence. Says designer Ritu Beri, “Personalisation is always the key when it comes to styling. Today, trends and brands showcasing one design in several colour schemes is boring.” The era of designer dictating terms may not be completely over, but the designer needs to understand their clients’ tastes more intimately to be relevant.”Adds Beri, “Blogging is dynamically changing how people choose their style and clothes. I have seen how they can actually wear a plain basic tee in 10 different ways and drape a simple saree in different styles – which I think is amazing.”The future of fashion lies in personalisation. We live in a world where individuals are increasingly encouraged to take charge of their own fate; they are challenging established sartorial trends and creating their own every day. Says artist and styleblogger Neha Sahai (@wildflowernehasahai on Insta) “As an artist, I like to define the clothes I wear. I personalise my fashion with exciting personal patterns and embroideries. I also dress-it-up with 15 bangles, 3 rings, a pair of earrings, a nose pin, a bindi and kajal. I find it exciting to wear a saree with a funky T-shirt, with my artwork. I think personalising fashion makes it dymanic and very bohemian.”Designer Sunil Mehra agrees. He says, “These days, a luxury client begins his fashion journey with the designer by sitting and discussing his or her personal dos and don’ts. Personalisation is definitely the new trend. And it’s evolving continuously. It’s going to have a strong influence in the fashion industry in the coming years.”Style, these days, is all about curating an experience for yourself, all the while collectively pushing the frontier of fashion towards a slow movement.— Raghavendra Rathore, designer“Personalisation takes art of craftsmanship back to its glory days”There is an upside to individual expression. The idea of personalisation also takes the art of craftsmanship back to its glory days, where products were made for the customer on a one-to-one basis.— Shivan Bhatiya, designerThere was a fatigue with designer and brand labels, when I started blogging.

To reduce stress and anxiety, infuse your homes with things that promote peace and positive energy – and most of the time, those items are all-natural. Here’s how to build your home into a safe haven.If you haven’t seen agate or amethyst accessories in your nearest retail store yet, expect them to rule the shelves soon. For centuries, different cultures have displayed crystals in their homes, believing them to carry therapeutic energies harnessed from the earth. From supermodel Miranda Kerr to the pop crooner Sam Smith, healing crystals are having a moment in Hollywood. Kylie Jenner, who’s been spotted crystal shopping with Jaden Smith did a tutorial on crystal healing. They work beautifully as home decor, as they are sculptural and provide a “grounded, earthy energy” that helps to balance a space. Create zones for different crystal energies. For instance, quartz is used to amplify intentions while amethyst is used for protection.Rooms featuring curvature are rated as more pleasurable and may activate the brain’s emotional and motivation centres. According to research from environmental psychology, natural materials used in homes uplift our minds. Our homes should be designed to make our nervous system healthier. People feel less stress and fatigue in wood-filled spaces, which also benefit the respiratory and nervous systems. Psychology Today reports how spending time in rooms constructed with a moderate balance of wooden surfaces has been linked to decreasing diastolic blood pressure and to a general sensation of comfort. Greenery too reduces BP and production of stress hormones.The height of your ceiling impacts your behaviour. In a low ceiling room, people feel cramped and lose their temper more. Researchers believe this response derives from our evolutionary preference for spaces, the ability to see foes (or food sources) before they see us. A sense of being enclosed, seems to stimulate our fight-or-flight response.Much like plants, different woods have different benefits. For example, willow carries salicin for headaches. When you bring live-edge pieces into your home, you enjoy good vibes that come with the material. Invite natural beauty and energy into your home by displaying different woods.Reset the energy in your home by opening the windows, smoking the air with sage herb. It is a beautiful way of cleansing the space. Allow only positive vibes to come in.Be the sanctuary maker of your home. Create a comfortable atmosphere. That doesn’t just mean filling your space with blankets and pillows. It’s the small details that add a personal touch and make all the difference. Pick and place anything that lifts your energy, no matter how small. Think: crystals, plants, glass, feathers, art, photographs, family heirlooms, and other handmade items.Big windows overlooking a balcony garden offer emotional support. Just being able to see how the weather is and knowing what’s out there relaxes people and makes them feel more in control.People are craving raw and organic in their decor as much as in their diets",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74734001,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1583857/74734001.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/home-garden/how-to-make-a-happier-home/articleshow/74734031.cms

So, working from home during a shutdown, as the one all of us are in now, isn’t exactly something that ‘works’ for the industry. If you have been watching pictures and videos of Hollywood celebrities trying to keep themselves entertained during this ‘break’ and wondered what your fave stars in Bollywood and Sandalwood are doing, here’s the lowdown…Actor Ganesh shared a video on social media, in which he was seen turning his dining table at home into a sports arena. He was seen playing table tennis with his wife Shilpa and kids Charithriya and Vihaan. “When quarantined......dining table becomes tennis table??. Be safe, stay home vth family ??”, he captioned the video.Actress Katrina Kaif shared a muted video of her learning to play the guitar. The effort was “Work in progress. Sound coming soon in a few days, hopefully,” she said. Seems like musician Ankur Tewari is her guru, as Katrina ended the caption with: “can’t let down @ankurtewari.”“The way we dress, it’s perhaps the best thing our culture has ever done,” says Salman Khan in the video that he posted on social media, as he went about sketching two figures. In the video clip, he also seemed to be humming a tune that sounded like the title track of Kaho Na... Pyaar Hai.I am truly working from home. I was shooting for Kabza when the shutdown happened.

Of course, I’m also happy to spend extra time with the kids and Priyanka.For Deepika Padukone, it’s all about being productive during the quarantine period. The first picture the actress posted on social media was of clothes and cloth hangers, captioning it: “Season 1; Episode 1.

“Sometimes, adult food is fed to puppies, which leads to indigestion. They suffer from vomiting and diarrhoea,” says Dr Sarkar.Quantity matters. “If they are fed lesser than the normal quantity or in big gaps/intervals, they are bound to remain hungry all the time and gorge on any dirt lying around,” adds Dr Sarkar.Dr Natasha Couto says most dogs are over-fed, and sometimes, eat as much as the pet parents. “Adult dogs should be ideally fed just twice a day with a well balanced diet. Also, make it a habit to feed your pet well before your meals to discourage your dog from begging at the table for scraps,” she says.Some people who are vegetarian feed vegetarian food to their dogs. “They have the feeling that if they start feeding vegetarian food to their dogs at an early stage, their dog will become a vegetarian ignoring the fact that dog is a carnivorous animal,” says Dr Sarkar.This kind of mistakes are usually made to miniature breeds, who most spend their time mostly with children and eat whatever the child eats. These habit later causes kidneyfailure, haemorrhagic gastroenteritis and food poisoning.Dr Natsha says chocolates can cause chocolate toxicity and prove to be fatal. Feeding dogs sweets, chocolates and buffalo milk (rich in fat) makes pets overweight. Obese dogs are at high risk for arthritis and other orthopedic issues and cardiac problems. Let your vet recommend a specific food schedule.“Gum disease is more common in dogs on soft food diet. Teeth and gum diseases can eventually lead to various organ diseases,” shares Dr Natasha.“Not following vaccination, deworming schedules leads to health issues,” warns Dr Sarkar. “Pets who are not vaccinated regularly on time could succumb to fatal diseases like gastroenteritis, leptospirosis and distemper. Also regular deworming can prevent anaemia, diarrhoea and other problems. Please follow the vaccination schedules as provided by your veterinarian,” adds Dr Natasha.“Medicating your pet without consulting your vet can cause severe adverse reactions. For example: Crocin given to cats for fever/pain can be fatal while Brufen/Combiflam in dogs can cause severe gastritis,” shares Dr Natasha.“Any minor deviation from routine pattern should be noted and consulted with the veterinarian,” tells Dr Natasha.“Most dogs are not walked and are at home all day leading to overgrown nails, obesity and unsocial behaviour owing to being locked up all day indoors. Dogs need to be walked at least twice- thrice a day for a min of 15-30 minutes,” tells Dr Natasha.Not neutering/spaying your pet can lead to incidence of pyometra/mammary tumours in females and prostrate enlargement in males later in life. “Neutering your pet also prevents indiscriminate breeding, makes your pet more controllable and will also curb the progression of genetically transmitted diseases, such as hip dysplasia, cryptochidism, etc,” advises Dr Natasha.www.dogsandpupsmagazine.com; www.facebook.com/DogsandpupsmagAre you a proud pet parent?

Residents have been told not to move out nor let anyone come in for the next 48 hours,” said an officer helping the UP health department put together Kanika’s contact list.Another team of experts is scanning video footages and CCTV records of the five-star hotel where Kanika stayed between March 14 and 16. “There are reports that she dined in the hotel’s buffet and also attended several guests in the lobby. She was living there at a time when the South African team was staying in the hotel for the ODI match, which eventually was called off. There is information that Kanika was seen briefly attending a news channel’s annual conclave held at the hotel. Therefore, it is important to scan the CCTV footage and list those came in contact with her,” said an officer engaged in surveillance.“She flouted instructions on home isolation despite being a potential case of Covid-19… Instead of staying at home, she went socialising. Now after having tested positive, she has now put everyone who came in contact with her at risk,” said Dr Narendra Agarwal, Lucknow’s chief medical officer, who also lodged an FIR against the singer.In Kanpur, where Kanika went to meet her maternal grandmother, the DM has ordered sealing of the apartment. Police have been deputed to ensure that no one enters or leaves the building, which houses more than 35 families, for the next 48 hours. Health officials have also alerted Kanika’s kids and caretakers in London Lucknow police commissioner Sujeet Pandey said that he had got in touch with his counterpart in Mumbai. “We have also written to the police commissioner of Mumbai to find out if Kanika was properly screened at the international airport or not.

While three of the patients returned to the city from UK, what has set alarm bells ringing within the medical fraternity and the administration is the case of the fourth patient who has no travel history and did not come in contact with anyone with known foreign-travel history.

The man from Dum Dum was admitted at a private hospital in Salt Lake on Monday. He was suffering from fever and dry cough for four days prior to hospitalisation . His symptoms worsened on Thursday to acute respiratory syndrome and he has been on ventilation since.

The patient’s swab samples were first sent to SSKM Hospital , where it came out positive. It was then sent for reconfirmation to ICMR-NICED, the nodal diagnostic lab for the entire eastern region, where it again tested positive, Swasthya Bhawan officials said.

Sources at the private hospital where the patient is admitted said the 57-year-old was treated as a suspected Covid-19 patient right from day one and kept in an isolation ward. “The hospital had taken proper protective measures for its doctors and frontline healthcare workers who were dealing with the patient. He is s currently in isolation ICU. His condition is serious” said a hospital source.

The health officials said they are trying to identify family members who had come in direct contact with the patient.

The other patient who tested positive late on Friday night is a 23-year-old resident of Habra in North 24 Parganas. The young woman had recently returned from Scotland, where she is pursuing an MBA course. She followed the instruction at the airport and headed straight to the Beliaghata ID Hospital, unlike the first two city patients who had sought hospitalization after several days at their respective homes raising a scare of transmission.

Now under treatment, doctors said her condition is stable. His father, a friend and the family driver have been kept in home isolation. The two other Covid-19 patients in the same hospital are also stable.

This will continue till March 31Konkan Divisional Commissioner Shivaji Daund said that there will be two teams and in each team there will be 5 personnel one from GRP, RPF, health official and two from the revenue department. These fleets will be stationed at the northbound and southbound entry points of the railways stations and will not allow passengers who are found to be travelling unnecessarily on the platform.There are nearly 150 railway stations under the Konkan division –From CST- Khopoli, CST-Panvel and Churchgate to Dahanu. “All these stations will be covered under our decision. The idea is to not let any passenger without an emergency reason to travel. We will send passengers home if they are found to be travelling unnecessarily. Mostly, passengers with a medical emergency –personal or in the family will only be allowed that too after verification by the health personnels on the team,” Daund told TOI. He added that people who want to board a long distance train, their valid tickets will be checked and only then allowed on the platform.He said that under the epidemic disease act, 1897 the state government has empowered all municipal commissioners, divisional commissioners and even collectors to take action to reduce crowding. If people do not cooperate then action can be initiated against them under IPC section 188 and even section 144 IPC for unlawful assembly, said Daund.He said that the revenue department staff should maintain a diary in which the details of the passengers allowed should be noted. He added that the team will be provided with adequate masks and thermal scanners.“On certain stations where there are multiple entry points, some will be blocked and only entry and exit will be allowed from the main gates so that each passenger can be checked,” said Daund. He also said that the idea is to discourage non-essential travel and ensure that there is a sense of responsibility amongst the people during the crisis situation.Also if people who are supposed to be in home quarantine are found then they will be sent to institutional quarantine, said Daund. The government has made the facility of institutional quarantine with the capacity of 7,000-8,000 and 4,000-odd rooms at non-occupied government and SRA buildings at Mumbai suburban area and Panvel respectively,” said Daund.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74754205,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-63950,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/coronavirus-general-people-not-allowed-in-mumbai-local-trains-from-sunday/articleshow/74754200.cms

PARIS: Amid the novel coronavirus scare around the world, a French researcher has reported successful trial of a new treatment line for Covid-19, with early tests suggesting it can stop the virus from becoming contagious in just six days.According to connexionfrance.com , Professor Didier Raoult from hospital l'Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire ( IHU Mediterranee ), put up a video to explain the trials held earlier this week.Raoult, an infectious diseases specialist, was tasked by the French government to research possible treatment for the novel coronavirus.According to the professor, the first Covid-19 patients he treated with drug chloroquine saw rapid and effective speeding of their healing process, and a sharp decrease in the amount of time they remained contagious.Chloroquine -- which is normally used to prevent and treat malaria -- was administered via drug Plaquenil.""We included everyone who was in agreement to be treated, which was almost everyone. Two towns in the protocol, Nice and Avignon, gave us infected patients who had not yet received treatment,"" Raoult was quoted as saying by connexionfrance.com.According to the media report, the treatment was offered to 24 patients, who were among the first to become infected in the southeast of France, and who had voluntarily admitted themselves to hospital for the process.Patients were given 600mcg per day for 10 days. They were closely monitored, as the drug can interact with other medication, and cause severe side effects in some cases, it added.""We were able to ascertain that patients who had not received Plaquenil (drug containing hydroxychloroquine ) were still contagious after six days, but of those who received Plaquenil, only 25 per cent were still contagious after the given period,"" he added.Chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine have previously been used to treat coronavirus patients in China, in ongoing Covid-19 clinical trials.Kaletra, a US-based antiviral drug used to treat HIV, is another medicine that is being tested in the fight against the deadly virus.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74754225,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-11880,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/covid-19-french-researcher-reports-successful-drug-trial/articleshow/74754225.cms

We don’t want tourists coming to Goa until situation settles: Health minister

Maharashtra, Goa, Bihar and West Bengal have sealed their borders for buses from March 22 to March 31. Mizoram suspended issuing inner line permits with immediate effect to stop people from outside from entering the state.In Maharashtra, restrictions on entry and exit of MSRTC buses, those owned by other state transport undertakings and private tourist buses were imposed. Goa sealed its borders with Maharashtra and Karnataka from Saturday midnight. All passenger vehicles will be denied entry and only bona fide residents of Goa will be permitted to enter. Bengal won’t let buses enter or exit till March 31.Bihar has suspended all interstate bus services till March 31. Rajasthan has ordered a lockdown till March 31 while Odisha will lock down five districts till March 29. tnnMore than 3,500 tourist buses, specially luxury AC sleeper coaches, which arrive and leave Mumbai daily, will be hit by Maharashtra sealing its borders. However, the restrictions do not apply to private cars, tourist cabs, trucks and other heavy goods vehicles.“Transport operators are requested not to send any contract carriage bus from Maharashtra for interstate operations. Also no bus should leave any station outside Maharashtra to reach the state boundary after Saturday midnight. These instructions have been brought to the notice of all bus operators within and outside state and will be strictly enforced,” said Maharashtra transport commissioner Shekhar Channe.Even though there has not been a single positive case in Goa, “considering the critical phase the country is going through, it is necessary to be more vigilant and take all preventive measures that are required to prevent the community transmission of the virus,” chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Saturday. Goa issued the transport ban a day after the Karnataka government barred entry of passenger vehicles from Goa and Maharashtra. “We don’t want tourists coming to Goa until the situation settles,” health minister Vishwajit Rane said.

NEW DELHI: The government has decided that private laboratories with Covid-19 testing kits approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA ) can start testing suspected cases, significantly adding to the scope and numbers of persons who are being tested. The cost of such tests will also be specified.So far, government labs had carried out the tests and even this number has risen to 111, an increase from some 70-odd that were involved in testing for Covid-19 till a few days ago. Allowing private labs — around 50 initially — will also help address criticism that too few tests are being carried out.The government has broadened the criteria for testing to all hospitalised cases of pneumonia beyond the random testing of ICU patients. The testing had been restricted to persons complaining of Covid-19 symptoms with a history of foreign travel of those who came in contact with such persons.Meanwhile, ICMR maintained that community transmission of the disease has not been documented as yet. It added that testing strategy would be changed further if there is evidence of a community spread.While allowing private labs to test, the Centre on Saturday said they can do so based on a prescription from a registered physician and as per testing guidelines and protocols issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The US FDA approval for kits is the key criteria apart from SOPs for bio-safety of samples and collection procedures.“We have arrived at a decision on allowing private labs. The order detailing eligibility to participate in the programme and the cost of such tests done by private labs will be issued by evening,” a senior official told TOI. The government has ramped up its network with 111 public sector laboratories now offering Covid-19 tests across the country.“Private labs will be guided by testing protocols and criteria fixed by ICMR,” health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said, emphasising that testing should not be “out of fashion” or as “a confidence-building exercise”.Meanwhile, testing protocols were also revised on Friday to include all hospitalised patients with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and cough and/or shortness of breath). It also said that “asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts” of a confirmed case should be tested once between day 5 and day 14 of coming in contact.According to the advisory, direct and high risk contacts include those who live in the same household with a confirmed case and healthcare workers who examined a confirmed case without adequate protection.The government maintained most Covid-19 cases in India so far are related to travel and local transmission from imported cases to their immediate contacts. “The testing protocol is based on a response according to the evolving situation. Public health experts take note of the evolving situation, discuss it and then accordingly take decisions,” Agarwal said.Ramping up preparedness for a possible influx of patients, the government also initiated training for critical care management at 1,000 locations through video conference, and said it would conduct a nationwide mock drill on Sunday for emergency response to handle coronavirus cases.The government has also instructed states to augment production and supply of masks and sanitisers by doing away with permissions for capacity augmentation for existing sanitiser manufacturing units. Similarly, deodorant manufacturers have been asked to produce sanitisers to meet the increasing demand. Alcohol manufacturers have also been asked to supply the raw material, and also set up units on their own if possible.The government has also fixed the prices of masks and sanitisers under the Essential Commodities Act to avoid overpricing of these products. While the 2-ply and 3-ply masks carry a maximum retail price of Rs 8 and Rs 10 per piece respectively, the price of a 200 ml sanitiser unit has been fixed at Rs 100.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74754121,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-387712,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pvt-labs-with-usfda-approved-kits-can-start-testing-for-covid-19/articleshow/74754107.cms

as social media influencer sounds strange, right? But not when the man behind the handle is

, a mathematician and epidemiologist who has closely studied how contagions spread. He’s also the author of a very timely book — an incredibly strange coincidence, he says — titled The Rules of Contagion. He tells

how maths can help contain the pandemic

You have studied how maths can help in understanding the spread of infectious diseases. Can it help us contain Covid-19?

You say that we have to live with social distancing for a year. What will that do to the economy and our lives?

Epidemics, pandemics lead us to an ‘us vs them’ situation. Why do stigma and segregation travel as fast as the pathogen?

You also question existing notions of how outbreaks happen and can be controlled. What’s the new wisdom on infectious diseases?

There’s a growing demand for countries to share DNA sequencing data of patients to study Covid-19. But how does this stack up against concerns for privacy and ethics?

How do you feel about your new social media stardom?

Maths can give us an idea of the scale of a problem and what we will be able to do about it. In the early stages, a person infected with coronavirus will pass it on to 2-3 people. Generally, there’s a five-day gap between one getting the infection and showing symptoms. You infect 2-3 people, after 5 days they give it to another bunch of people. So, with this kind of growth after a month or so you are going to be looking at hundreds of infections. If we implement really good social distancing, then instead of infecting 2-3 people, a patient will infect just over one. If you halve the amount of transmission, then you are potentially looking at a difference between hundreds of cases and a handful. Maths can be useful in giving us a sense that we don’t need to reduce our interactions by 99% — an average 50-60% would give us a huge difference in the outcome.It’s difficult to answer as we are really in unprecedented territory. The challenge we have got is that we know these intense social distancing measures can reduce transmission, but we don’t know the impact it will have on our daily lives, on our economy. But people need to be thinking about these measures on longer time scales. Some countries are claiming it’s a two-week change and we’ll be back to normal. This is going to be a long period of time. On the economic side we have seen people make efforts to look after their workers. I think it’s time to put people before profit. How we deal with our workers now will have a huge social impact in the coming months.With every outbreak, we see spread of fear and information. Fear, disgust, anger are fundamental survival emotions. Knowing what is bad for us has an evolutionary advantage because it prevents us from putting ourselves at risk. During an epidemic, we like to have a simple narrative of whose fault it is. That also combines with our tendency to put a story around these outbreaks. The Spanish flu, for example. Post-WWI a lot of countries had put censorship in place but not Spain. It was the only country that reported widely on the pandemic giving an illusion that Spain had many more cases. We are seeing the same with Covid-19. A lot of countries haven’t reported cases. That doesn’t mean they don’t have an outbreak. In the beginning everyone said it emerged from Asia. But new reports suggest that in Africa it’s being blamed on Europe.In the current corona outbreak, some people are taking more cosmetic measures. For example, temperature screening at airports. The problem with this is that the virus has a five-day incubation period. If someone has not been picked up while they are leaving a country, then it’s very unlikely that they will develop symptoms during a flight or when they arrive. You miss a vast majority of cases. It’s far more effective, as some countries are now doing, to quarantine all incoming people. Or, have clear information that all people flying in from certain countries need to isolate themselves.While data is a valuable resource in understanding how outbreaks spread, how we extract relevant components without compromising privacy remains a challenge. During the last stages of Ebola epidemic, there were cases of sexual transmission. Not many people were willing to come forward and share sequencing data as it was sensitive information. We need to create technology to respect boundaries.We scientists use Twitter to bounce around ideas, get a grip of the new science. With this outbreak many of us are getting more attention on what we are saying and doing. It’s common to see people make mistakes and misinterpret data during a pandemic. Through social media we can guide them towards things that are relevant. And with social distancing in place, it’s a platform to shout from and tell people that we need to take this thing very seriously.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74752211,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-43305,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/all-that-matters/social-distancing-is-here-to-stay-and-its-going-to-change-our-lives/articleshow/74752183.cms

LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh government on Saturday announced financial assistance through direct bank transfers to daily wage workers in the state, who stand to lose employment during the current coronavirus-linked slowdown. This makes UP the first state to implement a policy for lakhs of people in the unorganised sector in this time of the Covid-19 outbreak.No sooner was this announced, the Karnataka government told its labour department to identify the modalities of a similar state-funded scheme and the extent of assistance for daily wage labourers in the state.UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced Rs 1,000 monthly allowance each for around 35 lakh labourers, hawkers and vendors and free ration to 1.65 crore daily wagers. An estimated Rs 420 crore will be spent on the entire exercise.Over the next 15 days, each district administration will launch a mammoth exercise to identify beneficiaries and collect bank account details. Those without bank accounts or ration cards will get them on priority.“As a precaution, we directed several institutions to shut down or reduce staff. Lakhs of poor people will lose their jobs, so the UP government has come up with a proposal to pay them Rs 1,000 per month and provide free ration till the crisis ends,” the CM said.He said, 20.37 lakh people are registered with the labour department, but bank details of only 5.97 lakh are available. Those without accounts will get help from the district administration and funds from labour cess will be used for the allowance. A budget of Rs 203 crore has been set aside for this.Unorganised workforce of 15 lakh people like hawkers, vendors, rickshaw and cart pullers will also be identified by the district administration and Rs 1,000 will also be transferred to each of them through DBT entailing an expenditure of Rs 150 crore. The urban development department will prepare their database in 15 days.Also, the government will provide 20kg wheat and 15kg rice to about 1,65,31,000 construction workers and daily wagers like cart-pullers registered under Antyodaya Scheme, MNREGA and labour department. The disbursal will be undertaken in April. An expenditure of Rs 64.5 crore will be incurred on this process. “MNREGA workers who have not been paid till now will get dues cleared in March,” the CM said.Quarterly pension to 83.83 lakh beneficiaries of old age, disability and widow pensions will be given two months in advance, in April.The Karnataka government too is all set to take a leaf out of the UP initiative and provide direct cash transfer to daily wagers and construction labourers, whose livelihood has been severely hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.Soon after Yogi made the announcement, the labour department was told to identify the modalities and the extent of assistance provided to daily wage labourers.Labour minister Shivram Hebbar will meet his officers on Monday to lay out the scheme and later meet chief minister BS Yediyurappa for his approval.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74754260,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-547768,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/up-first-to-roll-out-aid-scheme-for-covid-hit-daily-wagers/articleshow/74754258.cms

In a tweet, the ministry said, “Railways has found some cases of coronavirus-infected passengers in trains which makes train travel risky. Avoid train travel as you may also get infected if your co-passenger has coronavirus. Postpone all journeys & keep yourself and your loved ones safe.”The railways also announced a change of refund rules to avoid crowding at stations. Railways said passengers can claim refund up to 90 days from the date of journey across counters instead of the current practice of three days in case a train is cancelled. This will be applicable for trains cancelled by the railways between March 21 and June 21. This even as the railway board ordered the closure of all rail museums, railways heritage parks and galleries till April 15.The railways said that eight people who travelled on the AP Sampark Kranti train on March 13 have tested positive for coronavirus. “We have appealed people not to rush and avoid travelling. Trains that are already running before Sunday but are due to reach their destinations will not be stopped,” said an official.He added that as per the relaxed refund rule, passengers will be fully refunded if they cancel their tickets for journeys till June 21 and for a refund for counter generated tickets passengers can approach any counter across the railway network.The norms have also been relaxed for refund in case the passenger doesn’t want to travel even as the train has not been cancelled.

Undertrial prisoners set fire to prison property and engaged security personnel in several rounds of pitched battles using bricks and axes and other sharp-edged weapons, forcing cops to open fire.Several prisoners tried to scale the 20-foot-plus walls of West Bengal ’s largest prison facility during the riot, which continued for over eight hours in the middle of a crowded Dum Dum neighbourhood; three others were caught trying to sneak out of the prison gates, officials said.The arsenal used by the prisoners indicated it was a “planned” jailbreak attempt, officials said, but there were three immediate sparks, all linked to Covid-19 fears and several steps implemented by the government over the last one week to control its spread.One of the immediate causes was a decision by prison authorities on Friday to suspend till March 31 the bi-weekly prisoner “interviews” with family members; this would have significantly reduced the number of jail visitors. Another trigger was a government proposal for a 15-day special parole for lifers who had already spent 10 years in prison with certified “good conduct”; this would have led to the release of 500 lifers and freed up several cells for use as isolation wards.The third issue that Saturday’s rioters mentioned was delayed court production of undertrials (courts are taking up only urgent matters and encouraging more video-conferencing).The first inkling of trouble came around 10.30am on Saturday when a section of undertrials, demanding hand sanitisers and masks, “started getting agitated”, officials said. This soon led to the demand that they be allowed their weekend “interviews” with family members. This was followed by slogans against parole applications being turned down (even as lifers’ applications “were being allowed”).",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74754294,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-438107,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coronavirus-curbs-trigger-prison-riot-in-kolkata-1-shot-8-hurt/articleshow/74754291.cms

NEW DELHI: The government has approved a mega Rs 41,000 crore booster for local manufacturing of mobile phones and their components , giving out incentives between 4-6% towards specified Make in India initiatives, apart from announcing a near Rs 7,000 crore scheme for manufacturing of electronics components, and for setting up manufacturing clusters.

Telecom and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the approval to the schemes, given by the Union Cabinet , is aimed at boosting investments in the critical electronics segment while positioning India as a global manufacturing hub.

TOI was the first to report on the development in its edition dated March 3, giving details about the mega plan towards boosting local electronics manufacturing and positioning India as a credible counter to countries like China and Vietnam .

“Two long-term policy decisions have been taken to make India a hub of electronics manufacturing in new directions and medical electronics. Cabinet has approved production linked-incentive for electronics companies. We will give Rs 40,995 crore in the coming five years for production linked-incentive in mobile phone manufacturing and specified electronic components, including assembly, testing, marking and packaging units,” Prasad said.

Incentives will be linked to incremental sales and capital investment of the companies, he added. “ ... because of these schemes, we hope to generate manufacturing revenue potential of Rs 10 lakh crore by 2025.” With the scheme, the government expects the domestic value addition in mobile phones to rise to 35-40% by 2025 from the current level of 20-25%.

Apart from this, the Cabinet cleared a Rs 3,285 crore scheme for promotion of manufacturing of electronics components and semiconductors. The scheme will provide financial incentive of 25% on capital expenditure for the identified list of electronic goods that comprise downstream value chain of electronic products such as electronic components, semiconductor/ display fabrication units, among others. The scheme is expected to create around 6 lakh (direct and indirect) jobs, he said.

On electronics manufacturing clusters, the Cabinet approved a budgetary outlay of Rs 3,762 crore, to be given over a period of 8 years. The scheme will provide financial help up to 50% of the project cost, subject to ceiling of Rs 70 crore per 100 acres of land for setting up of electronics manufacturing cluster projects.

Ravi told TOI over phone that the officers have been sensitized for making appeal to people to remain indoors for their well-being as well as of the society at large. “Minimum movement would be allowed on roads. The administration would ensure smooth operation of essential services like electricity supply and ambulance services on Sunday,” he said, adding that common people are already aware about the present situation.

Ravi also said the administration would also ensure that people stuck in any emergency situation are provided required assistance as roads would remain empty. He said Patna Municipal Corporation has been instructed to get garbage lifted from all the locations before 7am at any cost.

“We have requested the organizers of Chhath and Ram Navami processions not to make gathering this time. We have directed NDRF and SDRF to request Chhath devotees through associations during meeting for celebrating the festival indoors this time,” he said, adding the administration would appeal to people to abide by law and not to gather more than 50 persons anywhere at a time. “Police patrolling would be intensified on Sunday,” he said.

Meanwhile, SSP Sharma said directions had been issued that all four-wheelers in police stations be used for intensive patrolling with an attempt to persuade people that they remain indoors. “All quick mobile personnel on bikes would roam on the main roads and bylanes and appeal to the residents to remain inside for their own well-being,” he said, adding that no additional force had been requisitioned from outside the district.

He said police patrolling parties would also persuade people spotted on road to go back home for their own benefits.

KOLKATA: The West Bengal government has decided to postpone the ongoing higher secondary (Class XII) examinations and called off the Class XI exam, which are conducted by the schools based on question papers provided by the West Bengal Higher Secondary Council.

Three more days of exams remain now. These will be rescheduled. “The decision was taken in the wake of the ongoing crisis and the immediate need to prohibit movement. The pandemic may flare up with the number of affected persons multiplying in no time,” Chatterjee said.

Among the examinations, which are left includes physics, nutrition, education, accountancy, chemistry, economics, journalism & mass communication, Sanskrit, Persian, Arabic, French, statistics, geography, costing and taxation, home management and family resource management.

Earlier, the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) and the CBSE had decided to reschedule all Class X and Class XII Board examinations till March 31.

Delay in completing the examinations by a month will, however, have a ripple effect on the academic sessions as well the publication of results, alerted the educationists.

Angshuman Guha, an HS science student said, “There are a series of national entrance tests lined up from April. These are yet to be postponed. If those are not rescheduled, I may have to skip them.”

They say that without running water for everyone, fighting the new disease is impossible. Patna University (PU) geology department head Ramesh Shukla says, “Over-exploitation of groundwater — the only source of water supply in Patna — through deep tube wells has led its reservoir to deplete faster. For a city of nearly 25 lakh people already facing a major water crisis, the rapid depletion of groundwater will spell doom. The underground watertable in the state capital has gone down by more than 15 feet in recent years.”Environmentalist Mehta Nagendra Singh claims that many shallow tube wells have dried up in the last couple of years, leading to their complete breakdown.“Although the average annual rainfall over Patna is fairly high (about 1,000mm per annum), the bulk of the rainwater is lost through surface run-off. Things have come to such a pass due to the gradual disappearance of ponds and other open surface water bodies that helped recharge the groundwater reservoir through slow seepage,” he adds.PU environmental science and management course coordinator D K Paul points out, “Clean drinking water is a human right. People should not have to worry about the fact that their water is unsafe to drink or wash hands. We need funds to keep our water systems up-to-date and affordable.”He adds, “The corona crisis has made it clear once and for all that access to safe water, hygiene and health are inextricably linked.”",patna,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74759189,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-148772,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/experts-for-access-to-safe-drinking-water/articleshow/74751655.cms

After “unexpected” death of 78 pigs in different localities of the town on March 19, another 10 pigs were found dead on Friday. Bhagalpur DM Pranav Kumar had said attributed the death of 78 pigs to swine “fever”, which is different from swine flu.

Following the sudden death of pigs, Bhagalpur district administration has asked BMC to sanitize all 51 wards and remove garbage and filth within the municipal corporation area. Instructions have also been issued to quarantine the areas from where most pig death cases have been reported.

The animal husbandry department has also been advised to collect viscera samples from the dead pigs and probe the cause of sudden death of pigs.

Deputy municipal commissioner Satyendra Prasad Verma said the civic body was disposing the carcasses of dead pigs by burying them 10 feet under soil.

DM Pranav said the animal husbandry department has been asked to depute veterinary doctors in the areas concerned and make medicines available to the people rearing pigs. The DM also ordered a ban on sale of pig meat till March 31.

Stay safe, cops told: Bhagalpur police have taken several initiatives to protect police personnel from Covid-19. Hand wash and sanitizers are being provided to the arrested accused and criminals as well as visitors coming to police stations, traffic police outposts and police department offices.

55,['22/03/2020'],‘Homeopathy can treat Covid-19 but no common medicine for all’,"Veteran homeopath Dr Vilas Dangre believes that homeopathy has a combination of medicines with which one can treat a Covid-19 patient and can even get the patient cured, if given a chance. But this combination differs from person to person. Mass distribution of one homeopathic medicine as a cure or prevention of coronavirus is unscientific and against the principle of individuality on which the homeopathy is based on, he claims.In an interview with TOI, Dangre spoke at length about the burning issue which has hit the world in a scary way.Excerpts...Q. Is there any medicine in homeopathy to cure Covid-19?A. My one word answer is yes. That’s because homeopathy can treat Covid-19 symptomatically with a combination of medicines. But if you ask me exactly what that combination is then it would be difficult for any homeopath to tell you. This is because homeopathy is based on a principle of individuality. Every individual is a different case for us. We can’t generalize. Two individuals showing a similar set of symptoms may be prescribed different sets of medicines in homeopathy based on various parameters. So, my final answer is yes. Homeopathy has a medicine for Covid-19, but there is nothing like one common medicine which is applicable to all.Q. Some groups are distributing homeopathic medicines, drops at public places claiming it be preventive vaccines. How reliable are these medicines?A. This virus is new and all systems of medicine are still in the research phase. Presently, no system has discovered a medicine or vaccine to tackle Covid-19. Even doctors practising modern medicine are treating only the symptoms. No doctor of any system can claim to have a vaccine or a medicine for Covid-19. You can have immunity boosters to keep yourself fit and protected from viruses, but it couldn’t be called as Covid-19 vaccine. I also came across some practitioners who claimed in the media that homeopathy has a medicine that can cure Covid-19. I think some of them were over enthusiastic and many wanted instant popularity by issuing such fancy statements in the media. How can they claim their medicine can cure or prevent this disease when there is no evidence to support such a claim? Some practitioners are even distributing proven homeopathic immunity-boosters among masses. Their intentions are good. They could be thinking that their gesture will keep people away from unnecessary panic. But I think that even this exercise should be avoided.Q. Given the scenario, is a little bit of panic good?A. It is because I believe that a little bit of panic for a disease like Covid-19 is a must. We just can’t take it lightly. People may stop observing social distancing and taking other protective measures after getting the so called vaccines. This may put them at risk. Such immunity boosters can keep you fit, but may not protect you from coronavirus entirely. This virus spreads rapidly. It can affect a large population within a short span of time. We have examples of Iran and Italy where thousands have died just because people failed to follow the necessary preventive practices. At the same time, I also suggest avoiding unnecessary panic. Many people are so scared that they have stopped meeting their neighbours. The example of a positive patient’s family in Nagpur is still fresh. Their own neighbours have boycotted them socially. We should avoid this type of misconduct. Be alert, be vigilant, but don’t be terrified of coronavirus. We have no option but to fight it together. The entire world is fighting it.Q. What is the best remedy to ensure safety?A. At present, the only way to protect ourselves is to maintain social distancing practices, hand-hygiene, avoiding visits to public places, parties and marriage functions. We are observing a janata curfew today and I think we need to observe more such curfews in the future. This is the only way we can stop the spread of coronavirus. For those who believe in homeopathy, my only suggestion to them is to not follow a common medicine. It’s against the basic principle of this system. Rather, you can visit your doctor, share all symptoms and get medicines as per your individual condition. This is the most proper way of getting homeopathic treatment.Q. Some theories are claiming that the harsh summer of Vidarbha will end coronavirus. Your thoughts?A. It’s unscientific to say so. In fact, such misconceptions will only complicate the situation. All of us must spontaneously practice social distancing. As far as my knowledge is concerned, the outbreak of coronavirus is not going to stop in a month or two. It’s not even a question of summer or winter or rainy season. It’s at least a year-long fight and we must be prepared for it.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74752377,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-66590,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/homeopathy-can-treat-covid-19-but-no-common-medicine-for-all/articleshow/74752378.cms

ARA: Notorious criminal Dani Yadav received bullet injury in his right thigh in an exchange of fire with the police near his house at Mahavir Sthan under Bihiya police station in Bhojpur district on Saturday morning. He was admitted to Ara Sadar hospital for treatment.

Bhojpur SP Sushil Kumar said Yadav had been released on bail around two months ago. Since then, the police had received several complaints against him for demanding extortion in Bihiya and the adjoining areas, he said.

The SP said more than a dozen cases were lodged against him in various police stations and Yadav was at present wanted in three recent cases of extortion, sexual harassment and loot of bikes, money and cellphones.

“The police had been conducting raids. On Saturday morning, we got an information about him. When the police surrounded his house, he tried to escape by opening fire. The police returned the fire in which he got injured. A country-made gun and some cartridges were recovered from his house,” Bhojpur SP said.

Meanwhile, police conducted a flag march at Bihiya to instill confidence among the people after the exchange of fire with Yadav.

In another incident, a 36-year-old primary schoolteacher, Abhishek Kumar from Khanani Kala village under Agiyaon Bazar police station in Bhojpur district, was shot at by two unidentified miscreants, when he was moving in the village on Saturday morning. The teacher got gunshot injury in his right hand and was rushed to Ara Sadar hospital.

PATNA: Skies turned cloudy at Patna and many other parts of the state on Saturday and weathermen have predicted showers along with thunderstorm at a few places in the state on Sunday as well.

The daily weather bulletin issued by Patna Meteorological Centre on Saturday evening stated that rainfall with thunderstorm would occur at one or two places in central and eastern parts of the state on Sunday. The weathermen attributed the showers to a trough line running from southeast Bihar to north-coastal Odisha.

Private weather agency Skymetweather reported that a cyclonic circulation was positioned over Vidarbha and a trough was formed from this system up to north interior Odisha. At the same time, an anti-cyclone had strengthened over north Bay of Bengal. Moisture from this system continued to grip eastern and adjoining central India.

“Due to the persistence of these systems, scattered rain occurred in south Odisha, isolated parts of Jharkhand and adjoining Bihar during the last 24 hours,” it said.

Vadodara: Former India player Atul Bedade, who is coach of Baroda senior women’s cricket team, was on Saturday suspended by Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) for allegedly misbehaving with women cricketers. The association said in its letter to Bedade that they had received complaints against him which amount to sexual harassment and public shaming.

Bedade will now face probe by an external inquiry committee that will be formed by BCA soon. “We had complaints against Bedade from some women cricketers. The association heard all the sides and decided to suspend him pending inquiry from an external committee,” said Ajit Lele, BCA secretary. The letter issued to Bedade stated that he passed personal comments on physical to personal issues like menstruation, that discourage the morale of team members. He has also been accused of angry outbursts unbecoming of a women’s team coach and using unparliamentary language that is not accepted of a person in-charge. Bedade has been accused of behaviour oblivious of gender sensitivity.

A BCA official said that 52-year-old Bedade has been accused of passing comments on menstruation for senior woman cricketer and demoralizing some players if they didn’t perform well. The inquiry committee that will probe charges against Bedade will include an external member from a women’s NGO to ensure fair investigation. Bedade wasn’t available for comments.

Sources said that Bedade wasn’t issued any formal showcause notice and suspended after being questioned on Friday.

Bedade was appointed as Baroda women’s cricket team coach last year. He was aiming to climb up the ladder and coach Indian women’s cricket team. Bedade, a level II coach, has also served as the Baroda Ranji team coach in the past. An explosive batsman during his cricketing days, Bedade has played 13 one-day internationals and 64 first-class matches for Baroda. He scored 3,136 runs in 64 first-class games including 10 centuries.

NEW DELHI: State health minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday visited three hotels in Aerocity where AAP government has provided quarantine facilities for passengers arriving at IGI airport from coronavirus-affected countries.

Jain, along with New Delhi DM Tanvi Garg and other officials, visited IBIS and Red Fox hotels and Terapanth Bhawan where the government has arranged 92, 54 and 36 rooms, respectively, at a daily tariff of Rs 3,100 that is paid by the beneficiary.

Jain said the facilities at these hotels were good and those straying in quarantine were getting all meals, water and medical attention. “The hotel staff are regularly talking to the quarantined people through phone and posting small videos on the local network to keep them motivated,” the health minister said.

He also spoke to a few people on the phone and sought information about their health condition. Those availing the hotel facility get three meals — breakfast, lunch and dinner — two bottles of mineral water per day, tea and coffee and other facilities such as Wi-Fi and TV.

Officials said the hotels have been asked to ensure that laundry of the guests in quarantine is not mixed with other people.

According to the orders issued by Garg, the meals to such guests are served in their rooms in disposable plates/containers. “The plates/containers used for this purpose should be disposed of as bio-medical waste ensuring due protocol. Security personnel should ensure that the movement of these guests is restricted to confined areas. The management shall also observe the movement of these guests through CCTVs in their control rooms,” the order stated.

Meanwhile, following complaints of black-marketing of masks and hand sanitisers, government teams raided several commercial establishments and took action against offenders. A team led by DM (central) Nidhi Srivastava found at least three pharmacies that were selling masks above the MRP. Officials said strict action would be taken against establishments violating the government orders and indulging in black marketing.

With reports of Malaysia looking to deploy its military to enforce a total lockdown emerging, the plight of those stranded at the airport is going from bad to worse.

Use WhatsApp to highlight plight in Malaysia

Those stranded included Mahima Gupta and Navin Mallya , two medical interns who had travelled to Malaysia for an internship. The stranded passengers are making all-out efforts to draw the attention of the authorities– both in Malaysia and in India—through a WhatsApp group – Fly2India Stuck ppl in KL. People have been sharing their tales of suffering through voice and video messages, while hoping for some positive news.

Want to ensure media co vers their plight

The main thrust of the group has been to ensure that their news surfaces in all major media – print and electronic—in their respective states – so that pressure is maintained on authorities and elected representatives for a workable evacuation plan.

Helping them are their contacts, friends and relatives, who are actively sharing their videos with the media to ensure that they are not forgotten, while they keep updating themselves of developments there.

Rajeev Kumar Gupta, Mahima’s father, told STOI that while Mahima and Navin are in Nilai, local accommodation arranged for them by dean of Kasturba Medical College, Mangaluru, the others at the airport are not so lucky.

Many have not changed clothes for days

“They are facing major issues with personal hygiene. Most of them have not had a bath or changed clothes for the past three to four days, and are largely dependent on local Indians for their food,” Gupta said.

No Covid-19 positive cases at airport

The heartening aspect, Gupta said, is there is no positive report of Covid-19 among those at the KLIA.

The government should evacuate them just as they are bringing back Covid-19 positive people from hotspot regions of the world, and sending them to quarantine facilities. In a related development, Indian high commissioner Mridul Kumar interacted with a few stranded Indians at the KIAL airport, and re-assured them of the government’s support.

Rajkot: Ahead of Sunday’s Janta Curfew, main markets in Rajkot remained closed on Saturday voluntarily. Traffic on the road too remained very slow and the city almost kept itself under a self imposed ‘lockdown’ kind of a situation.

However, in midst of this, panic buying is pushing prices of essential commodities, especially green vegetables abnormally high.

Accroding to the trade association the major markets of the old city area like Dharmendra Road, Ghee Kanta Road, Lakhaji Raj Road, Kotharia Naka, Gundavadi, Sadar remained closed. The markets in newly developed areas like Kalavad road and 150feet Ring Road also remained closed. The Racecourse Circle, a favorite hangout for the citizens, wore a deserted look during the day.

According to the traders, fearing a lockdown people are going on a buying frenzy leading to prices of essential commodities like vegetables increase by more than 25 percent on Saturday. President of Dharamendra Road Traders Association, Nand Kalyani, along with other traders took a decision on Friday night to close down all the markets of the old city area. The trade leaders also went to the market to convince those people who kept their shops open on Saturday.

The Congress poster thanked people of Madhya Pradesh and quoted the chief minister’s Friday tweet, “The hopes and trust of Madhya Pradesh have been defeated. The greedy and the enticer have won.”

71,['22/03/2020'],Uttar Pradesh: Health dept seeks police help to locate 12 foreign returnees in Bareilly division,"BAREILLY: With health department failing to locate at least 12 people who recently returned from abroad, the department has now sought help of police to trace them. Officials said it is important to trace these people to check if they have developed any Covid-19-like symptoms.

According to data with health department, seven people in Bareilly district , four in Pilibhit district and one in Shahjahanpur district could not be traced till Saturday after they returned to India. Health officials said, according to the government’s guidelines, a foreign returnee has to be tracked for a period of 28 days. During the 28-day incubation period, if any of the foreign returnee develops symptoms like fever or cough, he or she will be tested for Covid-19.

Additional director (health), Bareilly division , Dr Rakesh Dubey said, “After we received a list of foreign returnees from immigration department, a team of health department was sent to their homes. However, they were not found at the address and we have now sent the list to police to trace them.”

Deputy general of police (Bareilly range) Rajesh Pandey said, “We had received a list from health department about foreign returnees and the list was shared with local police stations. However, they were not present on the address mentioned in the passport.”

According to health officials, a total of 24 people in Bareilly district were initially untraceable, but of these, 17 were later found staying in other parts of the state. Sources said a total of 146 people who are native of Bareilly travelled overseas in the past three months and of these, 66 persons have completed incubation period of 28 days and are out of observation.

Meanwhile, following state government’s order, out-patient department (OPD) at district hospital was shut from Saturday onwards. However, to screen patients with fever and other suspected cases of Covid-19, a flu clinic has been set up in the district hospital.

A team of doctors have been deployed in flu clinic on roaster basis from 8 am to 2 pm and 2 pm to 8 pm. “Patients will be checked, treated and tested at flu clinics. Though OPD services have been temporarily stopped, emergency services are functional round the clock,” Dubey said.

72,['22/03/2020'],"Covid-19 scare: Team of 1,000 fans out to trace Kanika Kapoor’s footprints in Lucknow","Officials from health department survey Mahanagar Extension for suspected cases of coronavirus on Saturday.

LUCKNOW: It was just a usual comeback for Bollywood singer Kanika Kapoor to her parents in Lucknow on March 11. The festival of Holi which fell just a day before, however, added much fun to her itinerary. So, as the Baby Doll singer immersed herself in a streak of parties and get-togethers, she forgot her travel history. And the fact that she could be a potential carrier of Covid-19 virus.

On Friday, the news that she has been tested positive for the virus, sent a shockwave not only across Lucknow, where she was socialising for almost a week, but also Kanpur, Delhi, Mumbai and London. As per a conservative estimate, she must have contacted at least 400 persons during social gatherings and persons interactions in Lucknow itself. Health officials identified 68 of them and their samples were sent for testing. Thankfully, 28 of them were found negative. UP health minister Jai Pratap Singh is one of them. But he will remain in self-quarantine for 14 days. Results of the rest 40 are awaited.

Coronavirus in India live updates

Lucknow district and health officials, however, are leaving nothing to chance in tracking down all her possible contacts during her stay. Their bid is to reach out to all who were present in social gatherings attended by Kanika. The enormity of the risk posed by her could be gauged form the fact that 100 teams having 10 members each have been formed to conduct a boots-on-the-ground exercise to reach out to each one who was present at the places Kanika went.

Additional district magistrate Amar Pal Singh, who is supervising these teams, said: “The combing exercise is being done as per union health and family welfare ministry’s standard operating procedure (SOP) on containment of coronavirus. Anyone who disrupts the scanning or doesn’t cooperate with the teams will face police action.”

The teams scanned every household in one kilometre radius of the apartment where Kanika was staying with her family in Mahanagar . “The building has been sealed and movement in the neighbourhood has been heavily restricted. Each of the team comprising health officials and others are going door-to-door with thermal scanners to segregate any possible suspected case,” he said. On Saturday, the team reached out to nearly 22,000 residents in the nearby localities.

The teams would then tap households in the three-kilometer radius. The entire locality is being sanitized with sodium bicarbonate solution for which the markets were closed down on Friday. Of these 100 teams, a few have been sent to the homes of those who hosted the party attended by Kanika.

“The homes of Adil Ahmed and Adesh Seth, who hosted two parties attened by her, have been sanitized. The residents have been told not to move out nor let anyone come in for the next 48 hours,” said an officer helping UP health department to put Kanika’s contact list together.

Another team of experts is scanning video footages and CCTV records of the five star hotel where Kanika stayed between March 14 and 16. A senior police officer also said, they have procured a list of 56 passengers who travelled from Mumbai-Lucknow flight. This comes 36 hours after she tested covid-19 positive.

“There are reports that she dined in hotel’s buffet and also attended several guests in the lobby. She was living there at a time when the South African team was staying in the hotel for the ODI match, which evebtually was cancelled. There is information that Kanika was seen briefly attending a news channel’s annual conclave held at the hotel. Therefore, it is important to scan the CCTV footage and list out those came in contact with her,” said an officer engaged in surveillance.

“She flouted instructions on home isolation despite being a potential case of Covid-19… Instead of staying at home, she went socializing. Now after having tested positive, she has now put everyone who came in contact with her at risk,” said Dr Narendra Agarwal, chief medical officer Lucknow who also lodged an FIR against the Bollywood singer.

In Kanpur too, where Kanika went to meet her maternal grandmother, the DM has ordered sealing of the apartment. Police have been deputed to ensure that no one enters or leaves the building, which houses more than 35 families, for the next 48 hours. Health officials have also alerted Kanika’s kids and caretakers in London. District Magistrate, Kanpur, Brahma Deo Tiwari said: “Almost everyone who could have met Kanika has been traced. The few left are being traced.”

Police commissioner, Lucknow, Sujeet Pandey said that he had got in touch with his counterpart in Mumbai. “We have also written to police commissioner of Mumbai to find out if Kanika was properly screened at the international airport or not. Details of the places where she stayed have also been sought,” he told TOI.

77,['22/03/2020'],"Before Sunday curfew, seven new coronavirus cases in Delhi","Seven persons in the national capital, two in Gurugram and two in Noida tested positive on Saturday

Delhi-NCR saw most confirmations of positive cases in a single day since the novel coronavirus outbreak as seven persons in the national capital, two in Gurugram and two in Noida tested positive on Saturday.

The 11 new cases come on the back of six more that were confirmed in Delhi on Friday, and indicate the graph of people testing positive for Covid-19 could head sharply northward over the next few days as more people are tested and more results vetted by the National Institute of Virology, Pune.

Saturday’s confirmations have taken the total number of positive cases in Delhi so far to 27, in Gurugram six and in Noida six.

Officials said of the seven new cases in Delhi, three are evacuees who were kept at the ITBP’s isolation facility. They are from Rajasthan, Jammu and Andhra Pradesh. Two are from East Delhi with travel history and the two others are daughters of a 38-year-old woman, a resident of Shahdara who had tested positive on March 17.

“The test reports of her son are awaited,” said an official.

The 38-year-old woman had, along with her 19-year-old son, travelled to Saudi Arabia on February 19 and returned to India on March 10. On March 12, she developed fever and cough and consulted a private doctor in Old Seemapuri. She had also visited her relatives in Jahangirpuri after returning from Saudi Arabia and two of her relatives residing there have been confirmed positive for Covid-19. Five contacts of the Shahdara resident are now Covid-19 positive.

In Noida, a Sector 74 housing society went into lockdown after a man in his late 30s who had travelled to Europe, including Italy, in the past few weeks, tested positive. His travel history was shared by RWA members and could not be independently confirmed. He returned on March 9 and informed the residents’ association and doctors only after he felt the symptoms last Monday. The other person to test positive was a man who returned from Switzerland via Dubai. He is a resident of Sector Alpha 2 in Greater Noida.

In Gurugram, among the two who tested positive on Saturday was a 50-year-old woman who lives in Sushant Lok Phase 1 and had returned from London three days ago. A 16-year-old resident of Palam Vihar, whose 22-year-old sister had earlier tested positive, was also found to be infected with the novel coronavirus.

“We have collected 12 samples from the society where the 50-year-old woman lives. Her husband’s test came back negative. The 16-year-old boy’s sister, who had tested positive last week, had been a student in the UK for the past year and a half. She had approached the health department on March 16. We had collected samples from her parents, brother and a neighbour. Only her brother has been found positive,” said Gurugram chief medical officer JS Puniya. “We have six confirmed cases in Gurugram now.”

The MCG has been surveying Palam Vihar since the 22-year-old tested positive on Thursday. The woman’s society has been sanitised and residents have been asked to keep children and the elderly indoors.

While efforts to contain the spread of the virus continue, a member of the health department staff may have contracted the virus, health department sources said. The staff collecting samples at the centre have been tested and the samples sent to PGI Rohtak for tests.

78,['22/03/2020'],Goa: Government doubles vegetable order to tide over 4-day break,"Vendors in Panaji municipal market are less worried as their customers have stocked up in bulk

PANAJI: Though essential commodities to be supplied to Goa from other states will continue despite the border control on vehicles, anticipating a three-day break in the coming week, Goa State Horticulture Corporation Limited (GSHCL) doubled its order for Saturday’s supply (which will reach Goa on Sunday) to ensure vegetable availability in the state.

Since the Belagavi market will be closed on Sunday owing to the nation-wide Janata Curfew, the vegetable supply scheduled for Monday morning is suspended. With Tuesday being the weekly market off in Belagavi, followed by Gudi Padwa holiday on Wednesday, the supply stays suspended for another two days. Hence, GSHCL ordered 200 tonne of vegetables to tackle the situation ahead of the four-day break.

The corporation orders around 100 tonne of vegetables which lasts a few days at horticulture outlets. Now, the stores are witnessing panic-buying by consumers owing to which the corporation decided to be prepared.

“Vegetable supply to Goa is not going to be affected since it will be covered under ‘essential commodities and groceries’. We kept most horticulture outlets open on Saturday so that people can come out and purchase for the coming week,” GSHCL managing director Sandeep Faldesai said.

“We constantly keep telling consumers that there will be no shortage and there is no need to buy in bulk. However, they don’t seem convinced, so we have stocked up double the quantity so that there is no shortage of vegetables at horticulture outlets in the first half of the coming week,” he added.

Vendors in Panaji municipal market, however, are less worried. “We are aware that the supply will be suspended till Wednesday. However, most of our customers have stocked up in bulk due to the Janata Curfew so that should last them until the first half of the coming week,” Jaffar Mokashi, a vendor, said.

The spot was barely 200 meters from the core forest area of Mala forest range of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve.

This is the third incident of a tiger attacking a human this year. Between February 1 and 5, 60-year-old Phool Chand of Baijunagar village and Roop Lal (45) of Vidhipur village, both under Gajraula police station, were killed in tiger attacks. As their bodies were found inside Mala range, PTR officials claimed they had intruded into the forest.

The latest victim was identified as Ramoni Sarkar of Mala village under Gajraula police station. People working in adjoining fields said they rushed to her aid on hearing her cries for help. On seeing people, the tiger left the woman and fled towards the forest.

Before the victim, who sustained severe neck injuries, could be shifted to hospital, she breathed her last.

Protesting against lack of security from big cats, residents of Mala village and neighbouring village panchayats blocked traffic on Gajraula –Richhaula road. The police had to deploy a force drawn from five police stations to control the crowd.

The protesters demanded installation of an electrified wire fencing along the entire stretch of the forest boundary to prevent wild animals from straying into human habitats.

The blockade was lifted after divisional forest officer Naveen Khandelwal said steps would be taken to install solar wire fencing in a 3.4-km stretch of Mala range. He also announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for the kin of deceased.

82,['22/03/2020'],Railway spread 1918 flu pandemic in India,"Kochi: Archived documents reveal that the railway was the major culprit in spreading throughout the country the influenza pandemic , aka Spanish flu , of 1918 , which is believed to have been brought to India by the returning influenza-infected soldiers of World War I. The pandemic, also named the ‘greatest medical holocaust in history’ and the ‘mother of all pandemics’ killed 10–20 million people in India, the worst-hit country in the world.

The first ascertained cases of influenza in Bombay occurred on a transport which arrived in May from Mesopotamia, says a 1919 report by Major Norman White, the-then high sanitary commissioner of India. He had recorded that in June 1918, influenza was first noted in Bombay, chiefly among employees and mill workers. By end of June, it spread up to Madras.

How did the pandemic spread so fast across the nation?

The annual report of the sanitary commissioner of 1918 gives the answer: “There is ample evidence during the first epidemic of the introduction of infection into a locality from another infected locality. The railway played a prominent part, as was inevitable. During the panic caused by the epidemic the trains were filled with emigrants from infected centres, many of them being ill. The post office also was an important agency in disseminating infection, also very largely through the railway postal service. Lucknow, Lahore, Simla and other cities are said to have been infected in this manner.”

An account given by the sanitary commissioner of Punjab was quoted in the annual report, which gives us an idea of the rapidity with which infection can be spread by infected individuals: “A recruit suffering from symptoms of influenza arrived at Narkanda and stayed a night with the Khansama of the hotel. Three days later the Khansama and his wife went down with influenza. Within a few yards of the Khansama’s house lived a blacksmith and the two used to inter-visit. A few days after the Khansama was attacked all the members of the blacksmith’s house were down with the disease. The postal peons used to frequent the Khansama’s house, with the result that they all contracted the disease and two of them died of it. The postal peons served as a disseminating agency and in a short time the Hindustan Tibet Road was thoroughly infected. Marwari traders, shopkeepers and even doctors, in fact, all who travelled by water, road or rail, were potential factors in distributing infection.”

In modern days, along with railway, airplanes also play a key role in the spread of infections. “Increased travel volumes potentially enhance the speed and spread of a future pandemic. In addition, the global shift of populations to urban centres has increased the size and population density of cities thereby favouring the spread of infectious diseases such as influenza,” says Rebecca F Grais in her article “Assessing the impact of airline travel on the geographic spread of influenza”. She and her team suggest that in their 2003 study that if the Hong Kong influenza pandemic strain of 1968-1969 had returned in 2000, it would have spread concurrently to cities in both the northern and southern hemisphere.

83,['22/03/2020'],"Before Sunday curfew, seven new coronavirus cases in Delhi","Seven persons in the national capital, two in Gurugram and two in Noida tested positive on Saturday

Delhi-NCR saw most confirmations of positive cases in a single day since the novel coronavirus outbreak as seven persons in the national capital, two in Gurugram and two in Noida tested positive on Saturday.

The 11 new cases come on the back of six more that were confirmed in Delhi on Friday, and indicate the graph of people testing positive for Covid-19 could head sharply northward over the next few days as more people are tested and more results vetted by the National Institute of Virology, Pune.

Saturday’s confirmations have taken the total number of positive cases in Delhi so far to 27, in Gurugram six and in Noida six.

Officials said of the seven new cases in Delhi, three are evacuees who were kept at the ITBP’s isolation facility. They are from Rajasthan, Jammu and Andhra Pradesh. Two are from East Delhi with travel history and the two others are daughters of a 38-year-old woman, a resident of Shahdara who had tested positive on March 17.

“The test reports of her son are awaited,” said an official.

The 38-year-old woman had, along with her 19-year-old son, travelled to Saudi Arabia on February 19 and returned to India on March 10. On March 12, she developed fever and cough and consulted a private doctor in Old Seemapuri. She had also visited her relatives in Jahangirpuri after returning from Saudi Arabia and two of her relatives residing there have been confirmed positive for Covid-19. Five contacts of the Shahdara resident are now Covid-19 positive.

In Noida, a Sector 74 housing society went into lockdown after a man in his late 30s who had travelled to Europe, including Italy, in the past few weeks, tested positive. His travel history was shared by RWA members and could not be independently confirmed. He returned on March 9 and informed the residents’ association and doctors only after he felt the symptoms last Monday. The other person to test positive was a man who returned from Switzerland via Dubai. He is a resident of Sector Alpha 2 in Greater Noida.

In Gurugram, among the two who tested positive on Saturday was a 50-year-old woman who lives in Sushant Lok Phase 1 and had returned from London three days ago. A 16-year-old resident of Palam Vihar, whose 22-year-old sister had earlier tested positive, was also found to be infected with the novel coronavirus.

“We have collected 12 samples from the society where the 50-year-old woman lives. Her husband’s test came back negative. The 16-year-old boy’s sister, who had tested positive last week, had been a student in the UK for the past year and a half. She had approached the health department on March 16. We had collected samples from her parents, brother and a neighbour. Only her brother has been found positive,” said Gurugram chief medical officer JS Puniya. “We have six confirmed cases in Gurugram now.”

The MCG has been surveying Palam Vihar since the 22-year-old tested positive on Thursday. The woman’s society has been sanitised and residents have been asked to keep children and the elderly indoors.

While efforts to contain the spread of the virus continue, a member of the health department staff may have contracted the virus, health department sources said. The staff collecting samples at the centre have been tested and the samples sent to PGI Rohtak for tests.

88,['22/03/2020'],Covid-19: Consultations on online platforms see 50% increase,"Doctors say people don’t want to visit hospitals due to the threat

NEW DELHI: As more and more hospitals restrict visits for non-emergency services, the demand for online portals offering teleconsultation with doctors is on the rise.

Practo, Apollo Telehealth and other such platforms said that the queries on the platforms has gone up by 50%. Many corporate hospitals are also firming up their own teleconsultation and video-consultation services to cash in on the demand.

“Online consultation is witnessing an average increase of close to 20% week-on-week since March 1. Most of the queries are related to infection by the novel coronavirus,” Dr Alexander Kuruvilla, chief healthcare strategy officer of Practo — a start-up that offers tele-consultation, said.

According to Dr Kuruvilla, people are scared of visiting hospitals because they fear they might contract Covid-19 from other patients. “Virtual healthcare or tele-consult allows one to reduce exposure while receiving affordable care at the comfort of one’s home,” he said.

The metro cities from where most of the queries are coming from are Bangalore, Delhi-NCR, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Pune, and Chennai (in that order). In the Non-metro cities, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Lucknow, Bhubaneshwar, and Indore are posing the most questions, the Practo official said.

Vikram Thaploo, CEO, TeleHealth-Apollo Hospitals, said they have witnessed a 100% surge in patients’ queries from top tier cities over the past few days. “Our telehealth centres are screening patients and offering them consultation and advice through video links”, he said.

Fortis, Paras, Artemis and other corporate chains also said they were strengthening their tele-consultation services for patients who require consulting doctors for chronic conditions or post-surgery follow-up.

“The demand for video-consultation has shot up by 25-30% in the last four days as people are preferring not to come out of their homes and strictly following social distancing,” said Dr Sameer Kulkarni, facility director, Paras Hospital Gurugram. TOI had reported on March 13 how private hospitals were witnessed up to 40% drop in OPD and routine surgeries due to Covid-19.

A doctor at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital said people were hesitant to come to Delhi for planned surgeries or follow-ups as they had heard about the viral cases in the city. “Last month, too, many patients postponed routine surgeries and follow-ups due to the riots. Now people don’t want to travel due to the threat of infection by the novel coronavirus,” said Dr Amrendra Pathak, a senior urologist. “I used to see at least 50 patients daily. But it has dipped by nearly 40% over the past two-three days,” said another doctor.

Vivek Srivastava, CEO of Healthcare at Home, said they have launched a helpline — +918047482373 — for coronavirus-related queries. “If the number goes up in coming days, we are prepared to provide home care to those recovering from the disease,” he said.

Police have registered an FIR under the sections of dowry death against four persons, including the husband, at Meerganj police station on the complaint of woman’s parents on Saturday. All the accused are currently on the run.

The woman’ father said, “My daughter was married four years ago and I had fulfilled almost all the dowry demands at the time of wedding. However, her husband and his parents started torturing her a year after the wedding. They were not happy with the gifts given to them during Holi and thrashed my daughter.”

92,['22/03/2020'],Beef supply hit as virus rumours spark shortage,"Panaji: The supply of beef to Goa has been hit as fears surrounding the coronavirus pandemic continue to intensify.

The live cattle markets of Karnataka, which supply the meat to Goa, usually source the animals from Maharashtra. They are slaughtered from Belagavi itself before being transported to Goa.

While the supply of essential commodities among the three states has not been discontinued, beef suppliers started facing problems owing to rumours about the potential spread of Covid-19 through cattle, thus impacting the supply of the meat.

“Cattle traders are not able to transport sufficient animals from Maharashtra into Karnataka because purchase has reduced,” said Margao-based beef trader Shaikh Shabbir. “As a result, Goa, which gets its beef from Karnataka, is not able to get enough supply. This is a result of various rumours surrounding coronavirus.”

The Margao market itself sees four mini-trucks transporting beef every day, with each truck carrying fresh meat of 10-12 animals. Now, traders said, only two trucks are coming in.

The situation is no different in Mapusa and Panaji markets, wherein vendors have said that supply is half of what it was last week. Those affected say that maintaining business continuity in the face of the coronavirus pandemic is difficult.

“We depend totally on Karnataka for beef supply. Since live animals are not easily available for sale, suppliers cannot provide enough beef to Goa. Until last week, we had a regular supply of beef, but supply is only 50% of that now,” said Mapusa-based beef trader A Bepari.

However, the beef which does make it to the shelves disappears quickly enough. Goans continued to purchase beef for consumption, mostly locals panic-buying on Saturday for the curfew on Sunday. In fact, the demand for beef among domestic consumers is usually slightly lower during Lent, the Catholic season of penance and abstinence. Demand for the meat is set to rise after Easter on April 12.

“Owing to the reduced quantity, our shops close soon after the beef is exhausted. Most often within the first half itself,” Bepari said. “There will not be respite from this situation anytime soon. The situation will prevail until March 31,” said Hussain Khatib, a trader from Panaji.

Although he didn’t respond to any of TOI’s calls and messages, many of those who attended the do confirmed that it took place at his Gautampalli residence.Former UP minister and senior Congress leader Ranjit Singh Judev, who was present at the party, told TOI it was held under the banner of Scindia Old Boys’ Association (SOBA). “It was held at Justice Sanjay Mishra’s official residence and office-bearers of the association, alumni of the school and some more guests, including Rajiv Kapoor and his singer daughter Kanika Kappor were also present,” Judev said, adding “a film producer Vishnu Agarwal and owner of a famous coffee chain were also among the guests.”“I left the party early because I had to attend another party at the residence of former BSP MP Akbar Ahmed Dumpy.

94,['22/03/2020'],"Amid coronavirus scare, Kolkata begins to heal its air and water quality","Air is cleaner





The skies are getting clear





Rare birds fly back to the city





Water is cleaner





More butterflies





Around the world





Deserted roads, vacant offices, malls sans customers and anxious residents cooped up in their homes —the past few days have taken a toll on human activities around the world, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. While we are flooded with upsetting news coming in from all quarters, slowly but surely a highly positive environmental revolution of sorts is taking place in Kolkata. The city, as it seems, is beginning to heal, what with significantly lower pollution levels, cleaner water bodies and rare birds and butterflies making a comeback.In November last year, Kolkata’s air was fouler than Delhi’s, with theaverage air quality index (AQI) going well past the 400-mark at Ballygunge . It prompted health experts to advise restrictions on outdoor activities,particularly morning walks. Currently, the city’s average AQI is between 70 and 110. “These figures indicate pure bliss. While discussing air pollution, we mostly talk about particles in the air that cause all types of physical illness. With lesser traffic and human activities, the suspended air particles aresignificantly lower in the atmosphere now,” said Kalyan Rudra, chairman of West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB). Similar readings were recorded on Holi due to a traffic slowdown.Lower amount of suspended particles in the air has led to better visibility too. This is giving photographers and stargazers a much clearer view of Kolkata’s skyline and night sky. Kaustuv Chowdhury, secretary general of Kolkata Astronomy Centre, said, “Though we have suspended all meets keeping in mind the coronavirus threat, all our members are stargazing from their respective homes. The stars are much brighter due to the clear sky. Justyesterday, I noticed Venus looking even brighter than usual.”Lower pollution levels are attracting more birds to the city, including rare ones. According to Swarup Saha, a bird watcher, birds are sensitive to pollution and there have been several sightings of rare birds in Rabindra Sarobar in the last 10 days, much more than compared to recent years. “Large hawk-cuckoo, blue throated blue flycatcher and ultramarine flycatcher are among the most interesting birds spotted recently. This is probably the first time a large hawk-cuckoo has been spotted in Kolkata,” said Swarup.Ornithologist Sumit Sen said one of the reasons for the increase in bird sightings is the reduced numbers of cars as well as humans on the streets. “Thanks to lower sound pollution, birds are now coming down on the ground to find food. This has increased the feeding hours for them,” he added.Not just air, the city’s water bodies are looking cleaner too. With lesser industrial waste and human activities, there’s been a possible reduction in pollutants going into the Hooghly. According to Kalyan, a monthly water test is conducted by WBPCB and the board will be able to reveal the actual data only after testing the Hooghly water next month. However, Bapi Halder, a fisherman and secretary of a south Bengal-based fisherman association, said they have noticed about 5% to 10% increase in the number of fish in the Hooghly. “Many are now sceptical about fishing due to the coronavirus scare. That is helping the fish population grow, especially the small ones. Besides, the water purity has improved with all the big trawlers and boats gone,” he said.Insects, known to be highly intolerant to pollution, are also finding their way back to the city. Somenath Pal Das, who specialises in butterfly gardens and breeding butterflies, said the number of butterflies in his garden has multiplied in the last one week. “Though I haven’t spotted any rare species yet, the numbers are significantly higher than what I saw even two weeks back,” he said. Species like common mormon, common lime, common palmfly and common rose are being sighted commonly now. “Declining pollution levels is the most prominent reason for this. Besides, with fewer vehicles on streets, insects are much more confident to come out of their hidings since collision with high-speed cars is one of the biggest reasons for butterfly deaths,” he added.#In New York, carbon monoxide, mainly from cars, reduced by nearly 50% compared to last year#China’s greenhouse gas emissions over the month of February are as much as a quarter below normal levels#A near shutdown of cruise and cargo-ship traffic around Venice has resulted in fish returning to the Venice lagoon and canals for the first time indecades",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74753407,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-6611824,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/amid-coronavirus-scare-kolkata-begins-to-heal-its-air-and-water-quality/articleshow/74753407.cms

Vadodara: With panic buying across all major cities of the state ahead of Sunday’s Janta curfew, sale of milk and other dairy products like milk powder, ghee, buttermilk, paneer, butter and tetrapak milk pouches shot up by 15% to 20% in Gujarat on Saturday.

Ahmedabad city, which on an average gets 15 to 16 lakh litres of milk every day from Amul, on Saturday crossed 18 lakh litres by afternoon and touched 20 lakh litres by late evening. “It is due to panic buying that our sales have crossed 20 lakh litres in one day in Ahmedabad alone,” said R S Sodhi, managing director of the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), the body that markets dairy products under brand Amul. He, however, reiterated that there is no shortage of milk in the state or across the country.

Across Gujarat, GCMMF and its member milk unions supply around 58 lakh litres milk per day. Like Ahmedabad market, which is the biggest in the state, other markets in the state too witnessed 15% jump in sales. “In other markets like Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot too, sales have increased by 15%. Not just milk, people are buying more dairy products in panic,” said Sodhi, adding that the average sales of products like ghee, paneer, butter, milk powder and tetrapack milk has also increased by 15%. “Even if there is a Janta curfew or lockdown, milk, being an essential commodity, will remain available. Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made it clear that there will be no restrictions on movement of those involved in milk supply chain. There is no need to panic as there is no shortage,"" Sodhi said.

GCMMF and its milk unions in fact are witnessing record procurement of milk these days. “At present, we are procuring 260 lakh litres milk daily which is 6-7 % more compared to the previous year. There is no problem in procurement, production, processing and distribution of milk or other dairy products. We have ample quantity of milk available,” he reassured, while appealing citizens to stop panicking.

""We have asked all to ensure that there is continuous supply of milk across all cities,” he said.

101,['22/03/2020'],"Coronavirus in Delhi: Shops down shutters, but essential services running","Sarojini Nagar market was in a ‘lockdown’, though locals had no problem procuring items of daily need

NEW DELHI: In a bid to keep the novel coronavirus at bay, key markets in the city voluntarily decided to down shutters for three days. On the first day on Saturday, commercial centres appeared deserted, though stores dealing in essential items were open and well-stocked.

TOI visited many markets and found that grocery shops, chemists and fruit/vegetable stores were open with no apparent shortage of supplies, contrary to rumours. Connaught Place, however, wore a deserted look and many of its restaurants were only offering takeaway/delivery services. People, however, could be seen crowding medicine shops. Jagdish Dogra (46), manager at Medicine House, Marina Arcade, asserted that people should not fear short supply of medicines. “The supply chain is working perfectly fine,” he assured.

Even though there is a level of panic among people, shopkeepers and market associations reassured of availability of supplies, some of them underlining this by restricting bulk purchase. In south Delhi’s Defence Colony, Rajinder Malik, president of the residents’ welfare association and owner of a grocery shop, said he failed to understand why people were panicking. “The Prime Minister has told the country there is no shortage of any essential item. When we try to stop buyers from making purchases for many months, some get angry but they have to understand that hoarding will create artificial shortage and hit the poorest members of society,” Malik said.

While other stores there were closed, those selling fruit, dairy products and medicines were operating. Some of them restricted entry at any particular time to prevent crowding inside the establishments.

Sarojini Nagar market was in a lockdown, though local residents had no problems procuring items of daily need. Mukesh Chhabra, owner of Dera Provisional Store, said his shop would remain open even during the ‘janata curfew’ on Sunday and dismissed all news about shortage as “rumour mongers exploiting people”.

Ashok Randhawa, president of the Sarojini Nagar Market Association, also appealed to customers to only buy as much as they normally did. “Prices will not go up. They might fall in fact because hotels and restaurants are buying less,” he pointed out. “However, people should take precautions just as we are doing by shutting the non-essential stores.”

Nearly 15 lakh business establishments in Delhi will participate in the janata curfew on Sunday, according to the Confederation of All India Traders. Its general secretary Praveen Khandelwal said, “The closure on Sunday will be extremely useful in protecting traders, their 30 lakh employees and the consumers from mass infection.” He also assured of plentiful supplies and asked people to desist from panic buying.

CAIT has also advised traders across the country not to deprive any employee of their wages or retrench workers because of closure of markets.

The state’s market share was below 10% five years ago.“This is a significant achievement and Gujarat can become a role model for other states in the country. At 35%, the state recorded the highest year-on-year growth in solar water heater space during 2019,” said Malaviya.“Gujarat’s growth can be attributed to the conducive atmosphere in the state for use of solar energy. There is a lot of awareness about solar energy and it has spread to semi-urban areas and villages as well,” he added. Previously, the penetration was limited to urban areas only.Gujarat now has the second highest market share in India after Karnataka, which at present has 48% share.Going by the industry estimates, Karnataka and Maharashtra were the top two states in terms of solar water installations followed by Gujarat. Maharashtra’s share, however, has declined to 15-16% in past five years. As a result, Gujarat has overtaken Maharashtra in market share, claim industry players.Solar water heater market may have grown over the past two years but standard solar water heater makers have not grown, say industry players.Those who follow standard specifications for solar water heaters are facing unhealthy competition from those who make non-standard solar water heaters and those imported from China.“The government should also bring in star ratings and mandatory compliance to BIS norms for solar water heaters. This will help the industry grow and benefit consumers,” said Kalpesh Kalthia, MD, Kosol Energie.According to Malaviya, there is also a need to set up a testing centre in Gujarat for evacuated tubes, which is a critical component of the solar water heater system.Photo Quotes:Gujarat’s growth can be attributed to the conducive atmosphere in the state for use of solar energy.

112,['22/03/2020'],JP Nadda welcomes Scindia’s 22 into BJP; Tomar is anchor,"Govind Singh Rajput and Imarti Devi after arriving at Bhopal airport on Saturday.

BHOPAL: A day after Kamal Nath resigned as chief minister, the 22 Jyotiraditya Scindia loyalists whose rebellion toppled the Congress government followed their ‘Maharaj’ into BJP in New Delhi on Saturday.

They had sent their resignations on March 11, which was accepted by Speaker N P Prajapati late on Thursday night, ahead of Friday’s floor test. On Saturday, after landing in Delhi, all of them said they would again “go the people of their constituencies”, preparing for bypolls.

They were welcomed into BJP at he residence of BJP president J P Nadda in the presence of Scindia, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Dharmendra Pradhan, and party national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya.

Wearing BJP scarves, the Scindia loyalists returned to Bhopal on Saturday night — 12 days after they left for Bengaluru. Pradhuman Singh Tomar said, “Maharaj showed his power and we scarified our posts for development.” They headed for former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s residence.

Like the central BJP leadership, state BJP also gave a red carpet welcome to Scindia’s 22. Chouhan said: “Twenty-two new members have joined the BJP family. I welcome them with open heart. They are now members of BJP. Our aim is to work for the development of state. We will work unitedly. People of MP celebrated Holi and Diwali together on Friday (the day Nath resigned as CM) and you all were the medium.”

BJP state president V D Sharma and other senior BJP leaders were present on the occasion.

Former Congress minister Govind Singh Rajput said: “We feel happy after joining BJP and we’ll try to fulfil all expectations. It was not easy to leave Congress, but we were not left with any option. The CM’s job is to link everyone, but despite being a cabinet minister, I hardly got chance talk to the CM (Nath) for 15 minutes on any issue.”

Earlier in the day, all 22 former MLAs were flown to New Delhi on Saturday, escorted by senior BJP leader Narottam Mishra and BJP MLA Arvind Bhadoria. They checked into a hotel where Scindia, Tomar, Pradhan and Vijayvargiya greeted them.

After meeting his loyalists, who toppled the Kamal Nath government, Scindia said they are his family, and he has “come to BJP with his family”. “It was not a fight to win or lose. It was fight of justice for the people of state and now our BJP government will do justice to the people of MP,” he said.

Scindia joined his loyalists on a bus ride to Nadda’s residence. Nadda came out on the lawn to greet them. Tomar — said to be in the running for CM — anchored the membership ceremony.

“It is a happy moment as the BJP family is getting new members. The ones present played an important role in what happened in MP in the past fortnight,” he said.

Former BJP state president Rakesh Singh, who was present at Nadda’s residence, said it is time for the Scindia loyalists to go back to their supporters and family members.

The 22 Scindia loyalists that joined BJP were Bisahulal Singh, Aindal Singh Kansana, Munnalal Goyal, Giriraj Dandotia , Suresh Dhakad, Raksha Sironia, Hardeep Singh Dang, Rajyawardhan Singh, Kamlesh Jatav, Raghuraj Kansana, Brijendra Yadav , Jajpal Singh , Jaswant Jatav, Manoj Choudhary and OPS Bhadauria. And the former ministers were Imarti Devi , Pradyumn Singh Tomar, Govind Singh Rajput, Prabhuram Choudhary, Mahendra Singh Sisodia and Tulsiram Silawat.

They all indicated they are preparing for bypoll. While in Bengaluru, they were in constant touch with Scindia and their family members, they said. Back in Bhopal, Scindia loyalist Prabhuram Choudhary said: “Kamal Nath ignored our leader, Jyotiraditya Scindia.

It is here in Surat that saris in the range of Rs 200 to Rs 300 are made. These saris have a huge market in the rural areas of several states, including Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, West Bengal, Chennai etc.Industry sources said that buyers from different parts of the country, mainly from Delhi and Mumbai have stopped coming to Surat due to the lockdown and fear of coronavirus spread. As the demand for saris has dipped across the country, the wholesalers in other markets have started cancelling their pre-booked sari orders.The low-cost sari business has been hit hard with the demand dipping by over 80% in the last few days. The buyers, mostly from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have cancelled the orders for cheap saris in the range of Rs 200 to Rs 300, which are sold in the rural areas.According to an estimate, Surat supplies about Rs 60 crore worth of saris per day to different parts of the country, which includes about Rs 20 crore worth of low-cost saris in the rural parts across the country.

According to rough estimate, payments to the tune of over Rs 1,000 crore have been stuck due to the pandemic.Sardar Bitta Singh, a sari trader at JJ market told TOI, “Two days ago, some of our buyers from Delhi cancelled orders for Rs 5 lakh worth of designer and low-cost saris due to coronavirus outbreak.

DEHRADUN: In the wake of the rising number of novel coronavirus cases, two major government hospitals in the city — Coronation and Gandhi Shatabdi — have shut their OPD services till further orders to prevent crowding. Officials said that only emergency cases will be handled at these hospitals.

Dr BC Ramola , chief medical superintendent (CMS) of Gandhi Shatabdi and Coronation hospitals, confirmed that no OPD service would be available at these hospitals where 16 suspected Covid-19 cases have been quarantined.

According to sources, Gandhi Shatabdi and Coronation hospitals witness a daily footfall of over 1000 patients. As their OPDs are shut, the authorities of the Government District Medical College (GDMC) have now displayed the contact numbers of all doctors on the notice board so that patients can consult them over phone.

GDMC principal Dr Ashutosh Sayana said, “We are treating Covid-19 cases at the hospital. However, shutting the OPD is not an option as people from various villages, who cannot afford treatment at private hospitals, reach our facility in large numbers. We have decided to display the doctors’ numbers to avoid crowding and enable consultation over phone.”

So far, the Uttarakhand health department has quarantined 1,324 patients, out of which 494 have already completed their 28-day observation period.

Kanpur: In wake of Covid-19 scare, National Sugar Institute ( NSI ) has shown a way to the sugar industry how it can address the shortage of hand sanitisers in the country.

National Sugar Institute, Kanpur has prepared alcohol-based sanitisers which are enriched with natural ingredients. The hand sanitisers have been prepared at the experimental sugar factory and alcohol unit situated on the institute's campus. Director, NSI, Narendra Mohan said that the sanitiser, besides containing 80% ethyl alcohol, contains hydrogen peroxide and glycerol as per guidelines of World Health Organization. However, it has been enriched by adding aloe-vera extract and rose water, he said. He further said that this hand sanitiser has been readied using alcohol produced from molasses at the experimental sugar factory on the campus.

""The sanitiser has been developed not for commercial purpose, but to inspire and provide technical know-how to the sugar industry as to how they can produce such good quality sanitisers in distilleries attached to their sugar factories. At this juncture, while this sanitizer will be of immense utility for people, in future the sugar industry may look into venturing into healthcare sector too enhancing their product range"", Prof. Mohan explained.

He mentioned that many sugar factories and machinery manufacturers from India and Nepal are already in touch with the institute and such product from the sugar industry would be available in the market soon.

Nagpur: Water supply is crucial to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and hence, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has stopped disconnecting defaulters from Saturday.

The civic body has also stopped attaching properties of tax defaulters to avoid violation of section 144 of CrPC.

In the aftermath of Covid-19, the cash-strapped NMC’s recovery of property tax has dropped. Cases of sale deeds of plots and flats have also come down.

Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe told TOI that he issued directions on Friday not to disconnect water connections of defaulters till further orders.

Taking serious cognisance of huge arrears of water bills, the NMC has launched a drive to snap water connections of all defaulters. Nearly 1,640 connections were disconnected.

On Thursday and Friday, there was tension in Mankapur and Futala following disconnection of water connections. People requested the NMC team not to disconnect water supply till end of Covid-19.

On Friday, MLA Vikas Thakre rushed to Futala and stopped NMC’s disconnection drive. He lodged a complaint with CP Bhushan Kumar Upadhyay, stating that a team of 20, comprising 15 from NMC and 5 from the police department, started the drive despite enforcement of section 144.

“Already, people are tense due to Coronavirus. They need water to wash hands regularly and also keep their premises clean. Instead of focusing on wealthy defaulters, the NMC is harassing poor people, some of whom have received bills amounting to lakhs of rupees,” he said.

NMC standing committee chairman Vijay Zalke sent a letter to administration directing it to stop the drive. “Disconnection will resume only after the end of Covid-19. People will have to come out of their homes for water and so, the decision has been taken to defer the drive,” he said.

The NMC has also stopped attaching properties of tax defaulters from Saturday. The action requires a team of over 5 people so the civic body stopped it to avoid violation of section 144.

NMC’s property tax recovery has also been affected. Against the daily collection of Rs1.5 crore, the NMC’s revenue dropped to Rs92 lakh on Friday. Generally, towards March end, NMC’s revenue increases but recovery has been hit hard due to the lockdown. The NMC has kept its collection counters open at all the 10 zone offices and the head office as well.

NMC assistant commissioner Milind Meshram said people should pay tax by using NMC’s online system. “Only 15% of the taxpayers are using it. We have provided an online payment facility on NMC’s website. We have also launched a special app. No extra charges are levied if the HDFC payment gateway is used online,” he said.

The stamps and registration department said, “Each of the nine registry offices used to record 25-30 sale deeds daily. Now, the number has come down to 18-20 per day since the last three days. Online facility is available and should be used by all. Only 45% cases are coming through online,” the department said.

IN A NUTSHELL

* NMC stopped disconnection of water connections of defaulters considering that water is crucial to prevent spread of Covid-19

* NMC also stopped attachment of properties of tax defaulters to prevent violation of section 144

* NMC property tax recovery dropped from Rs1.5 crore to Rs92 lakh per day

* Sale deeds of plots and flats also reduced

* There is no impact on water bills recovery

All major indices like Sensex, Nifty, mid and small caps, bank index have suffered steep fall.“Such sharp decline reminded investors of times in 2008 when in similar fashion all asset classes fell sharply due to global financial crisis,” said Mumukshu Desai, director, Artham FinoMetry Pvt Ltd.“There is further room for correction and high volatility over the next three months. The risk of downside is more than the scope of upside. Investors should wait and watch till March 31. Whenever they start investing again, they should do it in a phased manner,” said Nilesh Kotak, a city-based stock analyst.Mutual Funds yield negative returns up to 33%Volatility of stock markets has impacted mutual funds across various categories, be it equity-based mutual funds or even hybrid ones. Several MFs have yielded negative returns ranging from 30-33% since February.According to financial analysts, the volatility of the equity markets over concerns of fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic on industry and economy has multiplied losses for a number of investors, particularly in the past two weeks.“Mutual funds erosion is directly linked to the share prices of stocks. However, the silver lining is that SIP has not reduced and has remained on the same line. Investors are in wait and watch mode; and thus, while there is no major withdrawal, there are no fresh investments either,” said Jayesh Vithalani, a city-based financial advisor.Gold turns volatileGold and silver prices have remained extremely volatile after the COVID-19 outbreak and spike in cases reported in India. After touching a peak of Rs 46,100 per 10 gram in the Ahmedabad market on March 7, gold price has declined by Rs 3,300 per 10 gram from its peak to close at Rs 42,800. Silver prices have come down from Rs 46,400 per 1 kg on February 1 to Rs 40,500 per kg on Friday.“Investors who lost hefty sums of money in the stock market crash heavily sold gold and silver from their portfolio to maintain liquidity, which led to a sharp fall in the gold and silver prices. However, despite the volatility, gold and silver prices are expected to go up, as globally investors will turn to these commodities as a safe-haven investment,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA)Bank deposit rates declineBank deposits rates have also shown a significant decline with the RBI policy review. Since February, the country’s largest lender SBI has twice cut fixed deposit rates across multiple tenors for general customers as well as senior citizens.“After the RBI reduced its lending rates, the bank’s costs have to be aligned and therefore, the deposit rates have been reduced,” said Vikramaditya Singh Khichi, convener, SLBC – Gujarat. Sources said that in the wake of the the Covid-19 pandemic, if the RBI may further reduce lending rates in the upcoming policy review on April 4, there is further likelihood of decline in deposit rates. “This may be done to infuse more liquidity in the market to help cope with demand slowdown in the country,” said a financial analyst.Real estate investments unaffectedEven as other asset classes have yielded steep negative returns, real estate has emerged as a safer investment option in such a turmoil. “Real estate is unaffected with prices remaining stable, while investment value in other asset classes has gone down,” said Balbirsingh Khalsa, branch director, Ahmedabad, Knight Frank India.“Real estate, however, becomes less liquid as compared to other asset classes in such tumultuous times,” he said.The coronavirus scare has resulted in low footfalls and has temporarily affected sales. Given the current scenario, sentiment will be subdued in the first quarter of the next fiscal.“Given the massive erosion and panic in stock markets, there is a possibility of investors staying away from market for some time.” Nilesh Kotak, a city-based stock analyst“Time and again we have seen that strong Indian fundamentals — demographic dividend, diversified and consumption-based economy-have always helped Indian economy and in turn Indian stock markets have given handsome returns once the crisis gets over.” Mumukshu Desai, director, Artham FinoMetry Pvt Ltd.“Real estate is unaffected with prices remaining stable, while investment value in other asset classes has gone down.” Balbirsingh Khalsa, branch director, Ahmedabad, Knight Frank India“Safe haven investments in gold are expected to continue over looming uncertainty in other asset classes. The prices may remain volatile, but investors internationally will move to gold and silver owing to the ease of liquidity.” Haresh Acharya, director, IBJA",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-19-spread-wreaks-havoc-on-asset-classes-investors-tense/articleshow/74753385.cms

128,['22/03/2020'],"No shortage of critical drugs, major pharma cos assure PM","Mumbai: Major pharma companies assured the Prime Minister on Saturday there would not be any shortage of critical medicines in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak, ever after April, with supplies of certain raw materials having resumed from China. Significantly, the industry said there were enough stocks of hydroxychloroquine, a medicine used for rheumatoid arthritis and malaria, in the country, if there was need to use it as a potential treatment for Covid-19, sources told TOI. With a global race to develop effective treatments for the dreaded virus, hydroxychloroquine has emerged reportedly as one of the frontrunners globally.

PM Narendra Modi held a video conference with CEOs of top drug companies like Zydus Cadila, Dr Reddy’s, Sun Pharma and GSK, industry associations IPA, IDMA and OPPI, AiMed, bulk drug manufacturers’ and chemist associations including AIOCD, to assess supplies of key medicines and critical devices like ventilators in view of the rising number of Covid-19 cases. Earlier, the Union Cabinet approved a Rs 9,940 crore incentive package for bulk drugs and Rs 3,820 crore for medical devices.

The drug hydroxychloroquine has shot in limelight recently after US President Trump touted it as a potential treatment, while France has found early evidence that a combination of hydroxychloroquine and antibiotic azithromycin may be effective in treating Covid. Sources said Indian Council of Medical Research may include it in the treatment protocol of Covid-19 patients, but this could not be verified till time of going to press. “India has enough stocks of the drug, and if there is a need, we can also supply 25 lakh dosages in the country,” a company’s CEO who produces the drug, is understood to have conveyed in the meeting.

Main producers of hydroxychloroquine include Zydus, IPCA Laboratories and Cipla, while a majority of the drug is exported to US. Amidst the surge in demand, a shortage of the generic drug in US is being feared reportedly, according to American Society of Health-System Pharmacists. Regarding the stocks of medicines in India, earlier the industry had conveyed that it had an inventory for three to four months till March-April, after which it could face supply disruption. Shortages were feared mostly in key raw materials and APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredients) on which there is complete dependence on China including paracetamol, several antibiotics and vitamins, due to the lockdown in China’s Hubei’s province in the wake of Coronavirus outbreak. This had led to the government to impose export restrictions on 26-odd APIs earlier this month.

“Things are looking better with supplies of critical key raw materials and APIs having resumed. Some APIs have started from China. Also, we have asked the government to ensure a faster and priority clearance at ports, and to look at the option of air-lifting critical APIs, which may be required to ramp up production. We have stocks of three months,” a CEO with a Mumbai-based company said. Pharmaceuticals are fundamental to the healthcare security of the country, and our first priority is the domestic market. With an adequate stock of APIs, finished product formulations and channel availability, we can sustain the supply of medicines for the coming months. We are not aware of any medicines shortage to date,” Sudarshan Jain of Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance told TOI. Rajiv Nath, forum coordinator AiMed, said: “There is no crisis as far as ventilators are concerned as of now. We can ramp up production of critical devices if we get assistance in cargo-lifting of key components.”

In a letter sent to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Dipen Agrawal, President CAMIT, said, “Trade and industry were already in distress due to the worldwide economic slowdown during the last two years. Now, the world is going to confront the economy collapse due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In these hard times, Indian business enterprises, particularly the Small and Medium Enterprises, will be hard hit in short to mid-term. Besides its worrying effects on human life, this pandemic has the capability to slow down the economy. The impact of the same is clearly visible in trade and business. India is among the 15 most affected economies by COVID-19. Demand of goods is vanishing day by day as the number of affected cases are increasing. The situation will worsen due to lockdowns announced to prevent India from entering stage 3 of pandemic.”

Agrawal added, “Government should consider six points. All EMIs, including those of term-loans, should be extended by 90 days without penal interest or late payment charges and the borrower should be saved from adverse rating by CIBIL. Banks and financial institutions should be directed not to take adverse action and relax the conditions related to maintenance of margin against working capital limits obtained to run businesses for at least 90 days. Payment of Letter of Credit (LC) should be extended by atleast 90 days without any penal interest against Letter of Assurance from beneficiaries to avoid any mischief and chaos so as to protect the interest of banks as well as business entity. All time bound commitments under Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) such as collections from foreign debtors, export commitments, payment to foreign creditors, etc. which fall due between March 15 to April 30 should be extended by 90 days from their due date. Payment of GST for the month of February to April should be extended by 90 days without any penal interest and GSTIN should allow submission of returns without insisting on payment of GST. All regulatory compliances under substantive laws such as Income Tax, GST, PF, ESIC, Registrar of Companies (ROC) etc. and filling of returns should be extended for 90 days without there being any late fee due, he said.

137,['22/03/2020'],Lohegaon airport starts screening domestic flyers,"PUNE: The Pune airport started screening domestic flyers with a history of foreign travel from Friday, a senior authority of the facility said.

A state health department official said, “We ask the flyers about their travel history in the last 28 days and on that basis we screen them. We are trusting the information they give us,” the official said, adding the travellers with history of travel abroad are asked which country they visited, following which they are screened.

Pune airport director Kuldeep Singh said the state health department had commissioned two teams to carry out the screenings at the facility.

He said on an average, one passenger takes between 10 and 15 seconds to get screened.

At present, there are 170 flight movements at the airport and 85 domestic flights arrive at the facility. “There has been a drop of around 20 to 25% passengers in most flights,” an airline official said.

The Pune airport recently stopped the two international flights at the facility to Dubai. Over 2,100 passengers coming on the two international flights to Pune were screened from March 5 to 19. Over 5,000 domestic flyers were screened at the airport from Friday.

“Earlier this week, I was on a flight from Goa to Pune and many seats were empty,” a Pune-based passenger said. Many on Twitter expressed concerns about the crowd at the airport’s terminal building. The airport stated on Twitter, “All airlines in Pune have normal operations. Some flights may be combined due to lesser passenger load. Passengers are requested to check flight status from the airline concerned.”

Nagpur: After alarming rise in the number of coronavirus cases across India, the district administration has decided to tighten screening norms by now including even domestic passengers coming from cities like Mumbai, Pune and Chennai among others.

“So far, only those arriving from international flights were screened and moved to isolation centre at MLA hostel. Now, even those arriving from domestic flights would be screened as many of them arrive from abroad and then take domestic flights to the city. The virus is spreading from the passengers coming from other countries,” guardian minister Nitin Raut said.

He was speaking after a joint meeting convened by divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar and collector Ravindra Thakare, which was attended by public representatives, including MPs and MLAs, along with municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe and police commissioner Bhushan Kumar Upadhyay.

Later, while addressing the media, the minister talked about various measures taken by the district administration to contain the spread of the virus. “The citizens should understand that this is an unprecedented medical emergency and they should cooperate with the administration. We request all to close their establishments, else we would be forced to take strict action,” Raut, who was accompanied by animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar, said.

Acknowledging that poor and daily wagers would be suffering the most in the lockdown, Raut said the state cabinet had discussed the issue and would come out with a solution to help them out after March 31. “We’ve directed the NMC to restore all water connections of citizens which were snapped for defaulting on bills. We’re also taking help of NGOs and public representatives to spread awareness about the disease. We’ve advised flat schemes and townships to screen the visitors and keep sanitizers at the gates.”

On the alleged leak of list of quarantined persons, Kumar said, “There was nothing secret in that list, which contained information of those who travelled abroad in this period and were advised home quarantine.”

Munde said that they found two suspects who weren’t cooperating and one of them was later forced to go into quarantine at MLA hostel. “The citizens should report presence of foreign nationals in their localities if found,” he said.

On screening at railway station, Raut said they had advised railway officials to monitor passengers and on Saturday, they detained a couple of them who were suspects. “Those coming from outside in their private vehicles had to give a certificate that they hadn’t travelled abroad in the last 14 days,” he added.

Due to the lockdown, many main and internal roads hardly have any traffic. A lot of debris and construction material was lying abandoned on roads. The NMC could not lift it due to traffic.

During one of his rounds, municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe saw debris and constructions material lying on roads. Mundhe directed the NMC engineers to lift and dump it in low lying areas where rainwater has accumulated. Such places are ideal mosquito breeding grounds.

Accordingly, NMC superintending engineer Manoj Talewar directed the engineers of five of total ten zones—Laxminagar, Dharampeth, Hanuman Nagar, Dhantoli and Mangalwari zones to start the drive. The drive kicked-off on Monday.

The outbreak, which has forced countless people to work from the confines of their homes, hasn’t prevented cops from turning up at their workplace. Making it evident, the police department on Friday posted a picture of uniform-clad officials wearing face masks along with a caption: Jab tak yeh khel khatam nahi hota, apun idharich hai #WorkingFromPoliceStation #NagpurPolice #AlwaysThere4U.

PUNE: Wholesalers and commission agents at the Gultekdi Market Yard have announced a-daylong closure on Sunday.

Retailers in the city, however, said they have enough stock of vegetables and fruits to meet the needs of local markets. “On Thursday, we recorded a significant supply of vegetables and fruits to traders in the Market Yard. The retailers had stocked up on the supplies considering the three-day shutdown. Local markets in the city are unlikely to face any shortage on Sunday,” Vilas Bhujbal, head of the association of commission agents at APMC, said.

The shutdown is a part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's appeal for a “Janata Curfew” on Sunday, where he asked people to remain indoors from 7am to 9pm.

Sunday will be the third consecutive day that the Market Yard will be shut. On Friday, traders had shut their businesses to enable the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) to conduct a disinfection drive in the facility. The market remained shut on Saturday on account of the regular weekly holiday.

Manoj Kande, a vegetable retailer from Shivajinagar, said, “I am not sure if I will keep my shop open on Sunday, even though I have adequate stock.”

BJ Deshmukh, administrator at APMC Pune, said, “We had a meeting of the members of the traders’ body on Saturday. They were informed of the decision to keep the market closed on Sunday. We have all the machinery in place to assist the farmers for unloading the farm produce and assisting the local vendors in purchasing vegetables from the farmers. But, it is unlikely that the market would record any transactions on Sunday.”

Deshmukh said the farmers were likely to arrive to the market after 9pm on Sunday. “We are making arrangements to open the market from around 3am on Monday,” he added.

147,['22/03/2020'],FOLLOW THE LAW OR FACE POLICE ACTION,"Nagpur: Even though the lockdown due to the coronavirus came into effect in city early on Saturday, citizens were openly defying the rules forcing municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe to issue a stern warning. After random visits to a few of the crowded areas like Sitabuldi and Badkas Square, the civic chief forced many establishments to close their shutters.

Till 9pm, the city police detained 908 persons who were found wandering on roads despite Section 144 being invoked which prevents the assembly of more than four persons. Around 148 cases were registered for various offenses like keeping their shops open, etc. Total 82 calls were received on police helpline till 4pm.

Admitting that the citizens and industrial units had flouted rules, guardian minister Nitin Raut said about 90% citizens followed the directives and stayed at home. “We will take action against industries for defying the orders,” he said after being told that some units in Butibori and Mihan were operating.

In Amravati, collector Shailesh Naval ordered all commercial establishments to close their shutters till March 25, while in Akola, collector Jitendra Papalkar called for a total lock down between March 22 and 24. In Chandrapur, 1,085 students and citizens, who returned from Pune, were stamped with indelible ink and were directed to undergo home quarantine.

On Friday, Mundhe invoked Section 10 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, to clamp total lock down within city limits as per the instructions of the Maharashtra government, till March 31. He was followed by collector who imposed similar restrictions under Disaster Management Act, 2005, in entire Nagpur district that included industrial estates in Butibori, Hingna, Kalmeshwar and Mihan.

Earlier, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had imposed a lockdown in Mumbai and Pune, which are witnessing a jump in the Covid-19 positive cases.

As per the restrictions, all the commercial establishments should have been shut except essential ones like medicine and groceries, and also all vehicular traffic, including the cab services of Ola and Uber would be suspended. However, when the civic chief visited Seminary Hills, Katol Road, Futala, Timki, and Mominpura, it was like any other day.

During his visit to Sitabuldi at 11am, Munde took action against a popular photo shop as it was operating and seized its standees kept on display. “Lockdown means people are supposed to strictly stay indoors, but they were seen venturing out. Even local markets in many areas were seen functioning. If citizens don’t adhere to the law, NMC and city police will be forced take stringent action,” he warned.

The west and central Nagpur areas wore a deserted look as major markets like Dharampeth and Khamla were closed, except medicine and vegetables shops, and people preferred to stay indoors. However, places like Old Bhandara Road and Itwari market were congested as usual. Prominent markets, like at Cotton Market, Kamal Chowk, Mahal, Sakkardara, Jaripatka and Gokulpeth, were mostly deserted with only vegetable and fruit vendors present. Grocery shops, including the ones selling milk, witnessed walk-in crowd for most part of the day.

The corporation operated 75 of its over 400 buses on prime routes like Dhantoli and Sitabuldi. “As the number of vehicles on city roads was significantly reduced, Nagpur traffic police turned many traffic signals at busy squares into blinkers,"" said deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Vikram Sali.

The NMC is using electric rickshaws, garbage collecting vehicles to create awareness staying indoors till March 31. “We’re also using the 52 public address systems installed at various busy intersections in the city,” said Munde.

In the morning, CP Upadhyay broadcast a message to his force to initiate strict action if anyone is found violating the lockdown orders. Later, the cops visited different areas and booked several shops and kiosk owners under Section 188 of IPC for keeping establishments open. They also used public address system fitted on vehicles to make announcements regarding the orders of lockdown and dispersed motley crowds at different places.

Public transports at Ganeshpeth inter-district bus stop and railway station premises were spotted but their numbers were restricted. Even the crowd of the outstation passengers at Ganeshpeth bus stop was much lesser. The railway station too, was wearing a deserted look in afternoon, as many trains were cancelled.

The civic officials and NMC’s nuisance detection squads also had to shut down some shrines at Itwari issuing warning to the trustees. NMC’s assistant municipal commissioners, deputy engineer and other senior officials from all 10 zones too were on their toes entire day to enforce the lockdown. At Variety Square, assistant commissioner Prakash Warade was seen intercepting private vehicles and appealing drivers not to venture out unless medical emergency. Assistant commissioner Vijay Humne too, was seen vacating a temple in Jagnath Budhwari in Central Nagpur.

Street side vendors and cart owners faced actions and were also rounded up at Bharatmata Chowk by Tehsil police after they were found present on the roads. Tehsil police also rounded around 35 persons and registered offence against two shop owners. Koradi police too had pulled up a pan kiosk for clandestinely operating the outlet and also rounded up another 45 for their reasonless presence at the public places.

Auto-rickshaws and e-rickshaws, despite less in numbers, were found plying on the road. The pre-paid autorickshaw services at railway station was found operating. Rickshaws were seen plying outside the Ganeshpeth and other bus stops.

Even public representatives cutting across party lines have lauded the PM’s initiative stating that it was launched with a view that people should maintain social distancing and prevent themselves from contracting the deadly disease that has so far claimed over 6,000 lives across the globe.

“The janta curfew is meant for adopting social policing by citizens. This is a deadly virus which could take form of an epidemic if proper care is not taken,” animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar said.

Endorsing him, energy minister Nitin Raut said citizens cutting across party lines should follow the janta curfew. “It’s high time everyone strictly followed the administration’s orders by staying at home. This is not the time to think on party lines, but to come together and fight this menace,” he said.

Meanwhile, commissioner of police Bhushan Kumar Upadhyay has cancelled leave of all senior police personnel up to inspector level in the wake of the ‘janta curfew’ on Sunday where they would be deployed at various places to ensure that the public strictly follows the prohibitory orders.

Even transport services would be completely shut off to follow the PM’s call of Janta curfew, which many are terming as a ‘mock drill’ to face more such conditions in the future, in case the country faces an epidemic like in China, Italy, Iran and other European nations.

Pune: Daily wager Siddappa Khude was unable to find work for five consecutive days this week despite knowing several odd jobs.

Khude claimed that he could do different types of works, including gardening, cleaning and carrying loads. He said he could also be a helper in plumbing jobs. Still, he has been jobless over the week because of the Covid-19 scare.

The job search forced Khude to spend two hours at the “mazoor adda” in Budhwar Peth every day. “I am a regular at the ‘mazoor adda’ and never faced such difficulties in finding some work in the recent past. The past two weeks have been very tough. The demand for workers has gone down because of the ongoing Covid-19 scare,” he lamented.

Like Khude, many daily wagers are finding work hard to come by. Nagesh Misal, another daily wager, said he was recently offered a painting job, but this week he was told to stop coming to work. “When I checked with the managers, they told me that they did not want too many people at the site,” Misal said.

Vikas Hole, a contractor who engages daily wagers, said the jobs were either cancelled, postponed or put on hold. “There is almost a total shutdown in the market. People have postponed their work to avoid social contact,” he said, adding that “mazoor addas” at other places like Warje and Hadapsar were also experiencing dearth of demand for workers.

Ramesh Kenjale, a contract worker, said, “We take up furniture and painting related work in the area. But for the past three days, the furniture and hardware shops are shut. We don’t know if we shall be able to find a new work after completing the ongoing job.”

From delivering essentials and medicines to providing food to those relying on messes, Punekars are doing their bit to ensure no one suffers from difficulties during the troubled times.City-based NGO Action for Pune Development (APD) has launched an initiative to provide all necessary help to senior citizens, especially those over 70 years old. “Whether they need groceries, other essentials or medicines, we will try to deliver them. Either senior citizens themselves or their acquaintance can connect with us and our volunteers will try to deliver the requested items. We have also provided masks and gloves to our volunteers for their safety. We have also requested people, who have extra essentials stored at home, to send us a list of such items so that we can easily obtain some things when required,” explained Aakash Shah from the NGO.Ninebee, a citizens group in the city, has already distributed over 1,000 packets, each consisting face masks, sanitizers and information leaflets. “We are now focusing on assisting people with other important needs including grocery, medicines and others. Many shops are on the verge of closure as most things are out of stock due to panic buying. We are trying to help with whatever we can,” explained Guneet Kaur from Ninebee.Many others are trying to help in their individual capacity as well. City-based youth Kiran Pawar has taken to social media to offer help to the elderly or differently-abled. Pawar said, “Elderly persons are at a greater risk of getting infected. Many senior citizens live alone, have restricted mobility and need care and support in this period. So, I decided to help out anyone in need.”Nearly 750 persons from the city also registered with the Annapurna Group to provide meals to those dependent on messes, tiffin services or restaurants for meals. Nandu Phadke, who started the initiative, said, “We started accepting registrations for people to provide food and those who needed meals.

Mhaisekar and Pune collector Naval Kishore Ram held a meeting with industrial bodies as well as the labour commissioner and issued instructions on classification of essential and non-essential units so that a staggered closure can be carried out.

""If the industries are not able to follow the instructions to work from home and reduce staff, we have to go as per classification and issue closure orders accordingly. We cannot issue a direct closure for all as it will impact the economy,'' he said. Ram said that instructions have been issued to establishments to work with 25 per cent staff and they should be adhered to.

“Pune is an IT hub and around 70% services across the country depend on these companies. We will give the companies time to reduce staff,'' he added.

155,['22/03/2020'],"SSC paper put off, fresh dates likely in April","Nagpur: The final SSC paper for geography scheduled for Monday has now been postponed with new dates to be announced in April. This was announced by school education minister Varsha Gaikwad on Saturday afternoon, barely 24 hours after declaring that the exams will be held as per schedule.

The administration, however, conducted the Saturday’s SSC paper successfully as per timetable albeit with extra precautions from both students and schools’ side.

Schools said the state education department has remained indecisive right from the time the crisis started. A principal, whose family also owns a school, said, “Maharashtra state board should have announced this much earlier. It has been two steps behind CBSE and ICSE. It has been slow to react to every development and seem to be perpetually confused on what is to be done next.”

Another principal said lack of clarity is a typical style of functioning by the state education department. “First, the department announced holidays for students, which was good but there was no clarity about teachers. When we petitioned, the minister did the department talk about work-from-home concept. On Friday, it said the SSC exams as per schedule, on Saturday it said it’s not,” said the principal.

A school trustee said that the government would have been better off going ahead with the Monday paper. “It has waited for so many days, despite other boards shutting schools and even government announcing a lockdown. There was just one paper remaining and board exam is a major logistical challenge for all those who are involved in it. So may be it could have completed the exam and got things over with,” he felt.

Another school trustee however said it would have been a mistake to continue with the examinations “The dangers of having 15 lakh-plus students come out, commute on streets, gather in clusters in small rooms is a potential risk when the country is facing an epidemic threat.

Adarsh Vidya Mandir principal Ashnarayan Tiwari said, “All SSC candidates were provided with hand sanitizers before they entered the examination centre on Saturday. Our teaching and non-teaching staff was wearing masks, with some also wearing gloves as required.”

Teams of crime branch and local police stations are preparing a list of such people and also of those with whom they came in contact with, so that they all can be advised to stay under self-quarantine.

Police officials said that this exercise is being done so that if anyone who has come in contact with a virus-affected person, the citizen does not spread the virus further.

“This is solely being done so that people remain in isolation. There are instances where people are hiding their travel history without realizing that they are not only harming themselves but also all those who are around them,” said deputy commissioner of police Jaydeepsinh Jadeja.

Police are in process of taking details of all such passengers from the Airports Authority of India.

Jadeja added that cops will go to every household once they have enough details and ensure that such people keep themselves in self-quarantine. “It is a tough task but we will try to ensure that we reach out to as many people as possible,” Jadeja said.

He added that their task will become easy if people will themselves come forward to declare that they have returned from a foreign country and get into self-quarantine.

Senior police officials also said that if anyone will hide any information or give false information about their travel history then a criminal offence will be registered against them.

He said all the suspected patients tested by the institute till March 20 evening were found to be negative . He regretted that some of the messages on social media carried suspected patients’ names, their addresses and photographs.“Everyone is hereby reminded that privacy is a basic right of every individual. Even more importantly, patient confidentiality is an important principle in medical ethics and is considered as a sacrosanct right. The institute and its staff are committed to ensuring that the identity of the patients and their test results are not made available to anyone other than the treating medical team. Others are also requested to respect these principles,” he said.The institute has been equipped with necessary facilities and trained healthcare personnel as per the standards prescribed by the Union government to test for Covid-19 infection and extend treatment if the patients test positive. The institute has undertaken several measures and imposed restrictions to avoid overcrowding and spread of infection adhering to the Union government’s guidelines.Meanwhile, Puducherry restaurants’ association (PRA) has extended support to the ‘janata curfew’ called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and has decided to close restaurants and eateries on March 22.“We take this opportunity to extend our sincere gratitude and heartfelt thanks to all doctors, nurses, healthcare workers and government authorities for their selfless service during these testing times,” said PRA president Abdul Subhan.Lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi, while outlining the importance of the ‘janata curfew’ on Sunday said the curfew will prevent transmission of the virus from human-to-human for 14 hours. The curfew will reduce the risk of people contracting virus in open public places and ensure the natural death of the virus.Moreover, the 14-hour curfew will help people familiarise themselves with self-isolation and prepare them to face hardships, if any, in the future. It will also make people pledge to follow safe, healthy and hygienic practices and adhere to instructions of authorities to prevent the incidence and spread of the Covid-19 infection.Above all, the curfew is to recognise and appreciate those who have been tirelessly working to combat the disease.",puducherry,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/puducherry/suspected-patients-test-ve-for-covid-19-jipmer/articleshow/74748032.cms
159,['22/03/2020'],"Why we need to thank docs, health workers today","Nagpur: Apart from practising self isolation for 14 hours, the janata curfew on Sunday is also the best opportunity to thank doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, lab technicians and everyone from the city who are engaged in diagnosis and treatment of Covid-19.

The experiences shared by some young doctors working in isolation wards regarding crisis management will make us all realize why we need to thank them.

According to a resident doctor posted in the isolation ward at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), the treatment for Covid-19 includes continuous monitoring of vital health parameters of patients who are in isolation. “Only doctors can enter their rooms wearing all protective gears. We are only people to whom these patients can interact directly and share their feelings,” the resident said.

Isolation is challenging for anyone, but these doctors are trying to make it comfortable for the patients. Paramedical staff and sanitary workers in both GMCH and Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) are working with limited number of protective gears and ensuring that the entire ward is sanitized.

Lab technicians in IGGMCH are working 24X7 and conducting tests of as many samples as they can batch-wise every day. Many suspects visit these hospitals daily and counselling them is another challenge for doctors.

“I have seen suspects right from one year to 78 years of age. During the last 10 days, I have personally counselled IT professionals as well as a housemaid who don’t know English. It’s challenging, but fulfilling also,” said another doctor.

A junior doctor from IGGMCH, who was present when four suspected patients left the hospital without permission, said that she tried hard to stop them. “The suspects are already under pressure. They can’t believe they could be diagnosed with Covid-19. The entire team tried to stop the four suspects but we can’t force them beyond a certain level,” she said.

Still, doctors successfully convince most of the suspects to get tested and stay home quarantined. Many doctors are also following the quarantine practices voluntarily.

Residents living in hostels are staying in separate rooms. They also undergo regular check-ups. Till date, two of the doctors treating Covid-19 patients have developed symptoms. They have been tested negative. Many senior doctors are living in separate rooms at their own houses.

“I live in a separate room where any member of my family hardly drops in. After a hectic day in hospital, it’s difficult to stay lonely. But it’s important for their safety,” said a senior doctor.

Doctors have appealed citizens to stay at home during the curfew on Sunday. At GMCH, a team of doctors, led by GMCH dean Dr Sajal Mitra and superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande issued an emotional appeal that reads — ‘We stay here for you. Please stay home for us’.

A doctor from Nagpur Dr Yash Avinash Banait is posted at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, Mumbai. He is heading a team of 30 other doctors who are working dedicatedly to screen all the incoming passengers.

According to sources, the said doctor who runs his own private hospital went there on March 15 and took an inspection. During this time, he also dealt with patients but did not inform anyone that he had returned from abroad just a day before.

After the incident came to light, the authorities took immediate action and not only put the doctor under two weeks of home isolation but also closed down the hospital till further notice. Officials will also look at the reports of the patients that the doctor came in contact with during the week since he got back from Dubai.

From playing games to cooking together, this social distancing period has turned into a staycation at home for several families. Arunima Athalye, a home chef, says, “This phase has been a boon for us to connect as a family. We have been catching up on how much our son has grown and learnt. He is using this time at home to learn cooking skills. Once his father’s work from home hours are over, they play chess. We go for walks in the evening. This does feel like a home staycation.”

According to Aniruddha Patil, the founder of Pune Eat Outs, this period is a little more of everything that his family does normally. “There is a little more of eating and sleeping. Moreover, it is a little more of getting surprised with what a three-year-old knows. That little is almost 24 hours. So, the stay at home is pretty good. Now I know what animal offsprings are called, almost 30 of them. Also, it is surprising that there is no Netflix or phone use, at least not as much as normal days,” he quips.

City resident Purvi Dhanuka says, “The social distancing is taking us back to our roots and making children see fun in simple everyday activities, including helping at home, cooking and exercising.”

Entrepreneur Shamal Pitale says, “We have got a chance to spend time at home for ourselves, especially for our children, because of coronavirus. Schools, colleges, malls and almost everything are closed. We are spending quality time at home. I taught my child a few games I played when I was of her age. She likes drawing, so I taught her finger painting, spray painting and other forms of art. I have been cooking her favourite meals with her help. All in all, it’s a good time that we are enjoying.”

Working mother Gayatri Ganyarpwar Rudrakantwar says, “My husband and I are both working from home and we have divided time to play with our child in a way that it doesn’t affect work. In the first half of the day, my husband takes care of our son. After lunch, I take an hour off to play with him. From around 4pm to 6pm, he gets to watch little television. Then my husband takes a break for an hour and takes him out for a while. Then we all enjoy the rest of the day together.”

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The civic body on Saturday home quarantined eight doctors, who returned from Uzbekistan but did not inform the authorities about their travel history.

Confirming the move, Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar said, “We home quarantined the doctors soon after getting information about them.”

An official of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) said 40 doctors, including the eight residents of Pimpri Chinchwad, had gone to Tashkent in Uzbekistan for a conference. According to initial reports, these doctors did not inform the PCMC authorities about their travel history after returning to the city.

“The government as well as others have appealed to people returning from abroad to inform local authorities and undergo strict home quarantine to prevent the spread of Covid-19. People returning from abroad are screened at airports and information of those returning to our city is given to us,” said Hardikar.

On Friday, a home quarantined person and one of his family members were sent to the isolation ward in New Bhosari Hospital after the former was found going around in a car with his wife and father.

The civic body has made arrangements to start institutional quarantine at Balewadi, where it can accommodate 450 to 500 people coming from abroad. It also has created facilities to start a 100-bed isolation ward at Jijamata Hospital and a 30-bed isolation ward at an eye hospital in Pimpri.

A senior civic official said nobody tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday. A total of 613 people has been home quarantined in the Pimpri Chinchwad limits.

PUNE: State minister for food, civil supplies and consumer protection, Chhagan Bhujbal , has directed 500 manufacturing units in Nashik , Pune and Mumbai to increase production of sanitisers to address the shortage in the state.

“I have asked the sanitiser-producing units to ramp up production. These will be available in the market soon,” he told TOI.

In a notification issued on Thursday, the Union ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution asked all state governments to enhance production of sanitisers and ensure their availability to consumers.

Bhujbal said that the self-help groups have also been requested to increase the production of face masks as these would be required in the days to come. “While the local authorities have been directed to use funds and buy these locally and not wait for funds to arrive, we are making sure that there is no dearth of masks and sanitisers,” he said.

164,['22/03/2020'],"No masks at hand, they slog at city’s construction sites","GURUGRAM: In the wake of the coronavirus scare, the business and service class is either working from home or taking leaves and limiting their work-related activities. Getting the short end of the stick are the city’s daily wagers, construction workers and roadside vendors , for whom these options aren’t possible.The situation of construction workers, in particular, is precarious, as they are already exposed to excessive dust and conditions unfavourable to respiratory well-being.At many construction sites, scores of workers continue to work without masks and other safety measures advised by the health ministry and state government. While NHAI and GMDA claimed to have asked contractors to provide masks and sanitisers, the shoddy implementation of these advisories has stoked concerns.A visit to several such sites showed that only a few workers are wearing masks, while the majority of them have hardly any access to dispensable handwash or sanitisers. Covered in dust all day, many of them cough incessantly. But neither do they have the time to visit a government hospital and get tested, nor do they have access to any thermal screening camps, which labour unions feel should be provided by the administration.“A friend of mine told me that I should go to Civil Hospital and get tested. I’m taking tulsi and haldi (turmeric) daily for my cough and will think of seeing a doctor if time permits,” a worker said.NHAI claimed that all the contractors have been advised to strictly follow the advisory issued by the Union health ministry. “We have asked all contractors to ensure that masks and sanitisers are present at their sites. We also have onsite staffers who keep a close watch on the implementation of these guidelines,” a senior NHAI official said.The situation of daily wagers, roadside vendors, dealers at wholesale vegetable markets, and small-scale shopkeepers of local markets, isn’t any better. For them, choosing between their livelihoods and safety is a dilemma.A daily wager squatting at Labour Chowk near Sikanderpur metro station was visibly worried about the coming days. Like several others, he hasn’t gotten any work in the past two days, meaning no income at hand. The local grocery shop where he deposited money in advance for daily ration needs has been closed since Thursday.With all local markets and grocery shops either shutting down or limiting their operating hours, these workers are finding it hard to get daily essentials. They complained about their inability to stock food and medicine supplies for 2-3 weeks, unlike those in gated societies with stable sources of income. They ideally want to go home, but that will involve travelling in crowded trains or buses for many, which they want to avoid.The labour union feels that the response towards the pandemic has once again highlighted how the working class, especially those at the lower rungs, is easily left out from the policy vision.“Daily wagers are starving. They don’t have the income or the capacity to hoard essential items. Construction workers are working like slaves, with nobody even bothered about their safety. If anyone of them gets infected, it will affect the entire city. Ideally, the labour department should facilitate testing camps at all major work sites,” said Rohit Ruhella of Inquilabi Mazdoor Kendra, a workers’ union.“Like Kerala, the state government must utilise its labour welfare funds to provide all the daily essentials for these workers so that they can stay at home, quarantine themselves and not fret about sleeping with empty stomachs at night,” he added.Not surprisingly, the state’s labour ministry has no plans or answers to all these concerns. Asked if the labour department is doing anything for them or is planning to, a senior official said, “I don’t want to comment on anything at the moment.”",gurgaon,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74753490,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-120583,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/no-masks-at-hand-they-slog-at-citys-construction-sites/articleshow/74753491.cms
165,['22/03/2020'],"Amid shortage, medical stores overcharge for masks, sanitizers","Nagpur: Medical shops in the city were found selling premium N95 and simple masks and sanitizers at 150% profit margins, making them quite expensive.

Authorities from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and legal metrology department could only check sanitizer pricing but couldn’t stop them from overcharging of masks in the absence of specific rules. Both the products have been in huge demand in the wake of Covid-19 scare. On Saturday, these were in severe shortage at most stores leading to others exploiting the situation.

A special squad comprising two inspectors each from metrology department and FDA set up by the district collector took mild action against four medical shops at Ramdaspeth and Sadar.

Metrology inspector Anil Nalawade said Sagar Medical and Jayant Medical at Janata Square have been issued show cause notice after they were found selling a 670ml sanitizer bottle for Rs670. “They were charging Rs250 above MRP as per the new central government guidelines. Whatever be the purchase date, the retailer can’t sell it for more than 50 paise per ml now,” he said.

In the same area, the squad later inspected Prince Medical was selling N95, which is prescribed mask for Covid-19 confirmed and suspect cases, at Rs250. “We couldn’t make a case as they were selling it as per MRP, though exorbitantantly, but it was booked for other lapses,” he said.

In Sadar, the squad inspected Cash Chemists where again it found that sanitizers and substandard N95 masks were sold at exorbitant rates. “Action for not mentioning the customer care number and e-mail id on the N95 product has been initiated. There are severe penalties for this. The central government’s notification doesn’t fix pricing for N95 mask,” Nalawade said.

FDA Nagpur drug inspector Neeraj Lohakare, who was accompanying the squad, said violations under Section 65 of the Drugs and Cosmetic Act were noticed. “But we can’t take or prevent overpricing as it doesn’t fall under our purview,” he said.

Nagpur FDA joint commissioner Prakash Shende said, “Mask is not covered under our department and we have no control on its sale. But due to Covid-19 spread due to which masks should be available, FDA had decided to make prescription must for N95. We can’t stop them from selling or seize the goods as people need them right now,” Shende said.

Shahid Sharif, executive member of Consumer Protection Council Nagpur at district collector office, accused the squad of not taking coronavirus outbreak seriously. “A crisis is facing humanity and here, the authorities are passing the buck in reining in the syndicate. The company shown on paper as manufacturer of masks by these shops doesn’t make it. Beside masks and sanitizer, there is a similar issue with gloves. When I informed Mr Shende, he refused to take any action,” said Sharif, who is also chairman of anti-adulteration and consumer society.

167,['22/03/2020'],No room for social distancing in Pune’s thickly-populated slums,"The city has 426 slums with 1.40 lakh huts

PUNE: Kamlibai, who works as a maid and lives in a dense slum in Pashan, does not know what social distancing is.

“I live in a small room in Lamhan Tanda slum with four adults and two children. My next-door neighbours live just a few inches away,” she said.

“There are many people in my neighbourhood with fever and cough. Does that mean they have the disease?” she asked, fear writ large on her face.

For many of the city’s slum dwellers, who live cheek-by-jowl in small tenements with other family members, social distancing – the much bandied-about term in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak -- is a tough task.

“There are 426 slums in Pune city with 1.40 lakh hutments. Even if we consider that an average of 5 people live in each hut, it means there are about 7 lakh people who live in these slums alone and this is a conservative number as there can be more people living in each of these homes,” said Avinash Sakpal, deputy commissioner, slum eradication and rehabilitation.

A slum dweller in Mumbai recently tested positive for Covid 19. Though no such case has been reported from Pune yet, the authorities are worried.

Apart from the sheer number of people who live in proximity with each other, lack of personal toilets, narrow and dingy lanes and unclean surroundings pose a health risk to the slum dwellers.

Shahrukh Qureshi, a resident of Patil Estate slum in Shivajinagar, said, “Some PMC staff had come a few day ago and fumigated the entire area. But the condition of community toilets is deplorable as they are not cleaned regularly. As hundreds of people use the same toilet, better hygiene is a must here,” he said.

The problem is the same in Sanjay Gandhi Vasahat and Lamhan Tanda slums in Pashan. Overflowing garbage and stagnation of putrid water in dingy alleys are a common sight in these areas.

Dnyaneshwar Molak, deputy commissioner, PMC, said, “We are taking care of the cleanliness in slum areas. The ward offices are fumigating them. Waste pickers have also been asked to clean the slums regularly. We will provide soaps in community toilets and ask the staff to clean them regularly.”

168,['22/03/2020'],Auto drivers ferry labourers to MP after lockdown in city,"Nagpur: Even as most auto drivers in the city are worried about incurring losses due to the lockdown, Asad (name changed) is going the extra mile to double his daily income. On Saturday, he was among the few autorickshaw drivers who earned a Rs3600 through a 130km single trip to Seoni in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh which has sealed its border for public and private buses from Maharashtra due to coronavirus outbreak.

Even Chhattisgarh has closed its border for public and private buses from Maharashtra, creating problems for labourers who come from these states to find work in Nagpur. Some of the auto drivers who were stationed near Madhya Pradesh Parivahan Bus Stand saw an opportunity in this.

Some of the auto drivers at the stand told TOI that since morning five-six auto drivers have boarded passengers, mostly labourers who want to go to their hometowns in Seoni and Chhindwara following the lockdown.

“We are charging Rs600 per person for a trip to Seoni and Chhindwara. In a single trip, we take around six persons. There are no passengers during the return trip,” an auto driver said.

A one-way trip to Seoni or Chhindwara by bus costs around Rs200 to Rs250. But now passengers have no option but to agree with the fare charged by the auto drivers.

According to deputy RTO Atul Adey, auto drivers are not allowed to leave the district limit. “If any autorickshaw is found overloaded and out of the district limits, action will be taken. The transport commissioner has also issued an order prohibiting shared auto rickshaws from plying due to coronavirus outbreak,” he said.

The two had deployed a staff member at Uzhavar Shandy in Hasthampatty area on Saturday morning to lure the public. However, when TOI tried to talk to him, he fled.

The pamphlet had contact details of doctors - Dr P Elango and Dr E Indrakumar - who were practicing homoeopathy at a clinic on Gandhi road. TOI alerted deputy director of health services Dr J Nirmalson, who tried to reach the two on their mobile phones. “No one picked up the calls. They managed to escape and the clinic was found closed when our team went there,” the officer said.

He has lodged a complaint with the Hasthampatty police, seeking action against the errant homoeopathic consultants for trying to cheat people. TOI also couldn’t reach the doctors and their mobile phones were switched off since 11am on Saturday.

170,['22/03/2020'],Home quarantine list that went viral upsets many,"A citizen distributes masks among personnel deployed to enforce the lockdown in the city on Saturday

Nagpur: On Friday, a list with names of quarantined people in Nagpur went viral on social media leading to debates in various groups about the utility of such information being made public. Later, the authorities clarified that the list had been put up on their portal with a view of seeking community’s help to keep tabs on those who are under home quarantine.

Though there were talks about registering an offence against those forwarding it on social media, no official action had been taken till the time of going to press. There were almost 400 names there with some of them being prominent citizens of the city, or their immediate family members .

A senior doctor couple, whose name figured in the list, felt that this amounted to breach of privacy. “I appreciate the intention of the authorities and they are doing a fantastic job, but the list should not have been made public. It caused a lot of embarrassment to our family. Many friends and families started calling up and it took some time to take control of the situation,” said the doctor.

Later in some groups, message from family members of a person named in the list started circulating. The message expressed thanks “for the concern shown” and assured that the person is not simply in home quarantine and not a patient.

In another WhatsApp group, friend of one such person named in the list said that it was very upsetting for the family. Speaking to TOI, he said “The person is my classmate and he is being contacted on phone and WhatsApp by well wishers. In our school group, thankfully nobody is discussing it, though they do the same in private chat. But I feel this invades their privacy and people will stay away from them.”

The list also included directors of Centre Point group of schools, Arun and Aruna Upadhyaya, who insisted that TOI mention their names in the article. “We had returned from London as based on travel history, we were advised home quarantine. I am actually happy that the list was made public because this leads to an automatic social distancing with friends and family,” said Upadhyaya.

“This way, people know that they should not come to meet us for a few days more. And authorities have been fantastic with one Dr Khan from NMC calling me everyday to check on health status and even cops coming to inquire regularly. So, I feel that authorities are doing the best to make home quarantine work and the list going public has not upset us at all,” Upadhyaya added.

There was commotion at a nationalized bank’s branch on Saturday morning after a staffer claimed that a customer had breached home quarantine guidelines. The rest of the customers panicked and the branch was soon evacuated.

The man claimed that it was his uncle who had been put in home quarantine, and he was merely depositing a cheque on his behalf. Police said that they were investigating the statements of the person.

BHOPAL: A day after Kamal Nath resigned as chief minister, Congress workers put up a ‘we will be back’ banner outside the state party HQ, even as party MLAs demanded Nath be made leader of opposition and lead the fight against BJP .

“After the bypolls, we will be ready to serve Madhya Pradesh again,” said the poster, put up by PCC spokesman Sharyar Khan and state party vice-president Nagendra Tripathi .

On Friday, when Congress MLAs had met the outgoing CM following his resignation, Nath asked them not to be upset and assured that the government will be back after the bypolls.

Twenty-four assembly seats will go for by-election within six months — including the 22 Scindia loyalists who resigned and the two seats vacated after the death of Congress MLA from Jaura, Banwarilal Sharma, and BJP MLA from Agar Manohar Untwal.

The Congress poster thanked people of Madhya Pradesh and quoted the CM’s Friday tweet, “The hopes and trust of Madhya Pradesh have been defeated. The greedy and the enticer have won.” The billboard claims more than 400 promises have been fulfilled in 15 months of the Kamal Nath government, and says: “In the bypolls, people will teach a lesson to the Vibhishan who went against the feelings and wishes of the people of Madhya Pradesh and sold people’s mandate to BJP.” The poster ends with the slogan, ‘ Jai Jai Kamal Nath ’.

State Congress leaders believe the bypolls will be contested on the issue of development work undertaken by the Nath government during its short tenure, and schemes like Indira Griha Jyoti Yojana of subsidized electricity bills and farm loan waiver will give Congress the edge — and the seats needed to return to power.

P C Sharma, who was minister for law in the Nath government, told reporters, “Congress had secured maximum number of seats in the 2018 assembly elections. The bypolls will now prove who is in majority and expose those who secured power through horse-trading.” He called the breakaway Congress MLAs the “greedy persons group.”

Party MLAs have demanded that Nath be made leader of opposition and retain his position as state party president, Sharma said, adding: “The legislative party wants to fight BJP under Kamal Nath’s leadership.”

On Friday night, the state Congress tweeted, Preserve this tweet. On August 15, 2020, Kamal Nath will hoist the flag as chief minister of Madhya Pradesh and take salute of the parade. This is a very short interval.”

180,['22/03/2020'],"Poultry farm owner booked for dumping 1,500 birds in river","Nagpur: Sewagram police from Wardha district recently arrested a poultry farm owner and his employee for allegedly dumping around 1 ,500 birds, including some dead ones, in Dham river near Waghala village.

The accused, Rashtrapal Dhale, and his employee were later released on bail. The tehsildar office of Seloo along with the other government machinery removed the dead birds from the river and buried them in a big pit.

The accused were booked under section 269 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and 108 of the Maharashtra Police Act for putting people’s health at risk.

According to sources, due to the Coronavirus scare, the sale of chicken had decreased drastically. The owner of the poultry farm was depressed after suffering losses.

Unable to cope with the disturbing situation, the owner, along with his employee, took nearly 1500 birds to the Dham river at night and dumped them.

The dumping of the birds, which eventually led to their deaths, contaminated the water. The incident came to light the next day when some residents spotted dead birds floating in the river. After gram panchayat officials were informed, the government machinery was summoned and the dead birds were taken out from the river.

“We cleared the water which was contaminated due to the dead birds. We also filed a complaint with Sewagram police who took further action. Due to the Coronavirus scare, we are already on our toes. The incident did create a bit of a panic like situation, but we brought it under control. Now, everything is OK. We have also instructed the other poultry farmers to refrain from taking such drastic steps,” said Seloo tehsildar Mahendra Sonone.

Water from Dham River is supplied to many nearby villages.

“We swung into action after the incident was reported. We tracked down the poultry farm owner and arrested him. He dumped his birds into the river which is illegal. Due to the contaminated water, he also put the health of villagers at risk. He should have buried the birds in a pit rather than dumping them in the river,” said Kanchan Pande, PI of Sewagram police station.

181,['22/03/2020'],The Bengaluru CONNECTION,"BENGALURU: The past few months can be termed ‘innovative’ when describing drug smuggling in and out of Bengaluru city. Smuggling has always involved ingenuity. One of the earliest documented examples of smuggling – that of silkworm cocoons from out of China into Europe – involved a two year operation, culminating in a pair of monks smuggling the cocoons in the hollows of their bamboo staffs.Smugglers out of Bengaluru have smuggled contraband worth over Rs 18 crore including cocaine, ephedrine and hashish this financial year. The most recent attempt involved a fake wedding for which invitation cards were printed and a bogus designer whose garment spools were being exported — with drugs hidden in ingenious fashion.The Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) and its cargo section are where most of these drug smuggling activities come to light. The Customs authorities have noticed a significant uptick in attempts to smuggle drugs out of Bengaluru this year. On February 18, sleuths of the Customs Intelligence Unit at the air cargo section of the Bangalore Customs spotted a unique cargo — 45 spools of embroidery lace for garments. “The consignment of the spools as part of shipment of designer clothes was booked to Australia from Madurai by a Chennai-based exporter. We felt that there was something amiss about the shipment and opened out the garment laces to find tiny tubes of plastic with a white powdered rolled inside. Tests later determined it as ephedrine, a banned drug,” said an investigating officer with the Customs at KIA Cargo.The ephedrine that was discovered weighed a total of 5.11kg - worth a whopping Rs 5 crore in the international market. An investigation into the Chennai-based exporter showed that it was a bogus company. Why the Bengaluru cargo terminal was chosen for the smuggling is being examined.Fake weddingShockingly, before the drug smuggling investigation could make headway, the same KIA cargo unit received another suspicious consignment on February 22. This time, many wedding invitations–along with clothes and other items – was part of a consignment for an Australian destination. “This was within a week of the first case and what we did was immediately check if the wedding mentioned in the cards scheduled to be held on April 30, 2020 in Chennai was true. It turned out to be fake and we opened all the 43 fancy invites and were stunned to find powdered ephedrine smartly hidden. We haven’t found anything like this before,” said another officer who dealt the case.The ephedrine drugs, this time worth Rs. 5.05 crore, was also sent from Chennai. Customs sleuths believe that both these attempts to smuggle ephedrine were part of a larger operation. A thorough probe is under-way into the source of the drugs but progress has not been speedy.Salahuddin (name changed), from Kozhikode in Kerala, has links here with gold smuggling rackets operating between the Bengaluru and the Gulf. He claims to have helped recruit mules to smuggle gold into Bengaluru for a fee, apart from free tickets for the journey. “The drug game is big and murky involving big players who are literally invincible and invisible to the lower ranks. These consignments are booked using fake addresses and people moving them often don’t have a clue on who gives them the orders as they are directed through the cellphone. So it becomes difficult for investigators to find the links,” he said.Inside players hint at extremely innovative methods of drug and gold smuggling to avoid detection from the eyes of Customs authorities at KIA. “Bengaluru is dubbed as an easy spot for smuggling activity as the rackets are well aware that the city airport is huge and enforcement agencies inside are severely short staffed,” revealed Shaji, another Kerala-native who used to be a carrier. He refused to identify himself beyond the name citing pending investigations against him.Big fishes, drugs in padsThe sleuths of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) who are also a key enforcement agency monitoring drug and gold smuggling through Bengaluru airport had nabbed what they called a ‘big fish’ in the recent months. February again witnessed the arrest of notorious Kerala-based gold smuggler Shihabudheen Thadathil who runs a big racket smuggling gold between Bengaluru and the Gulf. His carriers use methods like body pouches and gold as paste stuck to the body. “The 46-year-old smuggling kingpin, as per our investigation, had managed to smuggle in 200 kgs of gold between June and October 2018 alone. He has been operating for over a decade and we had a look out circular issued against his passport which ultimately resulted in his arrest at Bengaluru airport on February 7th,” said a senior DRI investigator.The DRI also busted a gang with their mule who attempted to smuggle out hashish worth over Rs 30 lakh inside cereal boxes meticulously hidden inside his check-in luggage.However, the most novel method of them all was a drug smuggling attempt inside sanitary napkins and the carrier was a woman to avoid detection by authorities. Last year, the Bengaluru unit of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), busted the connecting gang operating from Austin Town who used to recruit women to smuggle hard drugs by air into the Gulf and seized 510gm of methamphetamine and 572 Lyrica, a sedative capsule, hidden in sanitary pads.“The enforcement agencies remain vigilant and items for export and luggage items are meticulously scanned for every possible clue. But these smart smuggling methods like the wedding cards and clothes spools are drastic steps taken by the racketeers trying to smuggle crores of rupees worth of contraband from Bengaluru. We too have some innovative mechanics to tackle the smuggling and will continue to clamp down the perpetrators,” added a senior Customs officer at KIA.Major drug busts at Bengaluru AirportFinancial year - Drugs seized - Value in Rs2016-17 - Methaquolane, Ephedrine - 14cr2017-18 - Ephedrine, Ketamine - 2cr2018-19 - Methaquolane - 6.45cr2019-20 - Ephedrine, Cocaine - 18crSneaking throughMarch 2, 2020: Cocaine worth Rs 8.30cr in 150 capsules swallowed by Guatemalan woman, lands in city, travelling from Brazil.Feb 22, 2020: Ephedrine worth Rs 5.05cr inside 43 wedding cards in a shipment to Australia.

Transport minister Perni Venkatramaiah (Nani) announced that all bus services will be suspended from 7 am to 9 pm on Sunday. All long-distance services will be suspended from Saturday night and resume on Sunday night, the minister said.

Nani also appealed to private travel operators to suspend all bus services. “The measure is being taken for the wellbeing of society and to contain the spread of virus,” he said and requested private travel operators support the cause. Drivers and owners of taxis and autorickshaws were also requested to suspend operations on Sunday.

The APSRTC has already removed the 25% concession given to senior citizens to discourage elderly persons, more at risk of contracting Covid-19, from using public transport.

Workers’ unions have demanded that managements consider Sunday as special casual leave as most bus services have been suspended. General secretary of APSRTC employees union Palisetti Damodar said on Saturday that as there is no clarity when services will be resumed, the management should give special casual leave to staff scheduled to be on duty in the cancelled services.

Collector K Rajamani on Saturday said the government has decided to allow Kovai Medical Center and Hospital, PSG Hospitals, Royal Care Hospital and Abhinand Hospital to admit and treat patients suspected of having Covid-19 and those tested positive.

“The hospitals have been asked to keep ready isolation wards that have 50 to 60 beds,” he said.

While the hospitals can admit and treat patients, the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital will be the authorized centre to do the test.

The health department is asking all those who were travelling and have Covid-19 symptoms to undergo the test, unlike earlier, when they were only testing people with specific symptoms so as to not overburden test centres and waste testing kits.

The collector also oversaw screening activities at the Walayar check post and Anaikatti. “All vehicles carrying essential commodities and patients with medical emergencies are allowed to enter the state,” said the collector. “We are also planning to establish another makeshift corona observation centre at Othakkalmandapam.”

Seven people who were tested at the Covid-19 test centre in CMCH have tested negative and so have four people tested on Thursday, health department sources said. This includes a 77-year-old man who visited Mumbai, a couple from Mettupalayam who returned from Sweden and a girl who returned from Spain.

Three patients were isolated at the CMCH and ESIC Hospital on Saturday include a three-year-old boy who has cold and fever. The boy and his family had recently returned from Rajasthan. The others are a 45-year-old man who returned from Odisha and a 35-year-old man who had been to Germany.

VADODARA: More than 50 Indians including a few from the state are stranded in London as they were unable to leave the United Kingdom despite having booked their tickets.

While the group that includes mostly students believed that they would be able to leave as flights to India would stop on March 22, they had to return from the airport after being told that they could not fly to India due to restrictions.

The group had bought tickets after India made the announcement that passengers of international flights could not disembark in the country after 1.31am on March 23. While this was true, another advisory issued by the Indian High Commission in London on March 19 had stated that the travel of Indian citizens including Indian students in the UK would remain restricted till March 31. It posted the information on its website and also tweeted it.

Believing that they would be able to fly to India till March 22, a group of students booked their tickets and even reached the airport. They were to travel to Dubai and then to India. But on reaching the airport, they were asked to return citing restrictions on travel for Indian citizens.

The students and a few others then reached the Indian embassy seeking help. “We booked tickets after the announcement of restrictions on fights after March 22. When we reached the airport, we were told that we could not fly. We are now stranded. We booked costly tickets and will get refunds only after two weeks. Till then we do not know how to survive as many do not have enough money. The situation here is serious,” said Itishree Yashesh Pradhan from Godhra who is staying there on a dependent visa.

Dhruv Patel, a resident of Vadodara, said that there were several Gujaratis amongst the group of 54. “Some people have shifted to a hotel arranged for them by the embassy. We booked the tickets on March 20. We did so fearing that we may not be able to leave later,” he said.

The high commission has been trying to convince the students to move to hotels. It has also tweeted steps taken to help Indians in the UK. But till Saturday evening, students were in no mood to leave the embassy and had even spent a night there.

Nagpur: Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) has issued a showcause notice to Mahagenco’s Koradi thermal power station (KTPS) for violating environmental norms.

The major violations by KTPS are failure to install flue gas desulphurizers (FGDs) despite repeated directives, effluent treatment plant (ETP) not functioning properly, etc

Mahagenco’s director (projects) V Thangapandian has submitted a reply to MoEFCC and sought a personal hearing in this regard. Mahagenco has submitted an application seeking terms of reference (TOR) for environmental clearance for two new 660MW units in Koradi. Any adverse development can affect the issue of TOR. A meeting on issuance of TOR was held on March 19.

Thangapandian has stated the reasons for delay in installation of the FGDs in the reply. Mahagenco at first sought a waiver on installation of the FGD but was unsuccessful. It then filed a petition in National Green Tribunal (NGT) seeking extension of deadline for installation of the equipment but later decided to withdraw the plea.

Mahagenco then floated an expression of interest (EoI) for installation of the FGD on one of the 660MW units (Unit 10) in July 2016 on built operate and transfer (BOT) basis. However, no response was received. It then floated a bid for this work on engineering procurement contract (EPC) basis in May 2017.

Later the top officials changed their mind and cancelled the tender. They floated a tender for installation of the FGDs on all three 660MW units of Koradi plant in March 2019. Due to ambiguities in the tender, it was cancelled again. A fresh tender was floated in September 2019 which had a provision of the successful bidder operating and maintaining the FGD for 10 years.

Techno-commercial bids were opened in October 2019 and financial bids were opened in November 2019. Meanwhile, permission was sought from Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) for installing these equipments.

Letter of agreement (LoA) for installation of FGDs will be put up before board of directors for approval and the equipments will be installed as per timeline of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Mahagenco has assured MoEFCC.

The MoEFCC team that had visited Koradi had raised objections on ETP not working properly. Thangapandian has stated that it was working partially due to O & M issues. However, soon these were addressed and now the plant is working at full capacity.

The generation company has submitted the figures of various pollutants measured at chimneys of the three 660MW units and claimed that all of them were within stipulated limits.

Bina Devi, who works in eight houses in Adarsh Nagar, says, “On Saturday, I worked in all the households. None of the owner asked me to take leave, apart from Sunday. I feel it’s justified too as most of the houses where I work have elderly or working class people. Elderly cannot afford cleaning and cooking on their own.”

There are several instances that people are sending their help to markets without realising they could become a carrier of the virus.

189,['22/03/2020'],Covid-19 drama over delayed funeral leads to panic,"Nagpur: There was a panic-like situation in Lonara village on the outskirts of the city after residents started feeling tizzy after a 53-year-old woman’s body was kept in Nagpal Colony.

The funeral, which finally took place on Friday, was delayed by 72 hours as the deceased’s son was held up at MLA hostel’s quarantine facility after landing at Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar international airport from Paris.

It’s learnt that the woman, after suffering for a prolonged period, had expired at a leading hospital in Pune on March 16.

In the death certificate, the reason behind her cause of death was mentioned as pneumonia and related complications.

The drama started after the woman’s body was shifted to her brother’s residence in Lonara’s Nagpal Colony, a day after her death.

After learning about his mother’s death, the son rushed to the city to perform the last rites. He landed in the city from Paris on March 17 but was quarantined at MLA Hostel for the mandatory 48-hour screening.

Meanwhile, a resident raised objections regarding the body of the women being kept in the freezer. He was doubting her cause of death. He had also shared his concern about the woman’s possible cause of death due to corona-like symptoms.

After the objections were raised verbally and via social media, local residents approached cops. They even questioned the delay of the funeral.

Senior PI Vazeer Shaikh of Koradi police station said he was flooded by calls from Nagpal Colony regarding the funeral. “We had to contact the doctor of the primary health centre of Gumthala who accompanied me to the house of the concerned person in Nagpal Colony on Thursday (March 19) to scrutinize the death certificate and other documents of the deceased. She did not die due to corona,” he said.

Shaikh said the reports of the medical history of the deceased was revealed to the residents after summoning them at a prominent place in the village. “We convinced the local population that there was no reason to panic or fear as her death had not taken place due to corona. At the same time, we also summoned the person who was rumour mongering and warned him,” said the PI.

He added the person, who was contacting everyone stating that there was a corona-related death in the village, was also served a warning notice.

It’s also learnt that the police had sent a team to MLA Hostel to check the health status of the woman’s son after the rumour was spreading in Lonara and adjoining places. Police and government agencies had also conducted a check at the residence of the woman’s brother to ascertain whether there was a home quarantine facility, if required.

A day prior to the Janata Curfew proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the markets, shops and malls remained closed in the city.

Likewise, the roads wore an empty look even in the evening. At some places, the police were seen using their powers of CrPC and asking tea stalls, fruit sellers, sweet shops etc to close their shops or to ensure that there was no over-crowding at their shops. The only ones that were seen open were grocery shops or diagnostic centres.

Coronavirus in India live updates

TOI on Saturday visited various parts of the city including the Walled City and found that the traders were closing their shops on their own. “Ab khatra badh raha hai, hum to kuch din band rakhenge (Now, the danger seems to be increasing, we will keep our shops shut for some days),” said Hukum Chand Tekwani , a wholesale trader of clothes at Chandpole Bazaar.

Similarly, the small vendors selling ice-cream, snacks and other roadside eateries, were also seen closed. “If it is better to be at home, then so be it. I will not open it for next couple of days or may be for a week,” said Raju Chahar, who sells paranthas near Polo victory area in the city. The roads also wore an empty look in the afternoon and evening, as people confined themselves to their homes and offices.

Areas including Raja Park, Jawahar Nagar, Aadarsh Nagar, MD Road, Janta Store, Gopalpura, Jagatpura, Mansarovar , Sikar Road, Jhotwara, Murlipura, Kardhani and others witnessed almost 70 per cent closure of shops. At some of the shops, traders pasted a notice saying, “Due to the danger of Covid-19, the shop will remain closed.”

However, in many areas, the police teams were appealing to the public to close their shops and to ensure no overcrowding takes places. “Using CrPC powers, we are not allowing any gathering of public. At the sweet shops, tea stalls, ice cream parlours, coffee shops, where we see gathering, we are asking the traders either to ensure no overcrowding takes place or are asking them to shut down,” said a senior officer of Jaipur police commissionerate.

194,['22/03/2020'],Automatic signalling in Nagpur-Khapri section,"The Rs20-crore automatic signalling system will help ease out bunching of trains

Nagpur: In a major move, the Nagpur division of Central Railway on Thursday commissioned automatic signalling system between Nagpur and Khapri (12.41km). The Rs20-crore project will help ease out bunching of trains.

This is the first automatic signalling system in Nagpur-Ajni-Khapri section. Automatic signalling is the most advanced system where several trains can be run between sections. Nagpur-Ajni-Khapri is a busy section where trains from both Itarsi and Howrah side run frequently.

In the present signalling system, only one train runs between two stations at a time. However, automatic signalling provides a feature to run multiple trains between two stations. Thus, with the new system in place more trains will depart and arrive at Nagpur and Ajni stations.

For the first time across Central Railway, live train movement with signal position can be viewed at stations and also by divisional control office.

Besides, the level crossing gate between Ajni and Khapri has also been provided with automatic approach warning of train. “Now gate man will get an audio buzzer when a train is about 2km away. This will help him close the gate on time. This is the first such system in Nagpur division,” said officials.

On Thursday afternoon, Jaipur-Mysore Express was the first train to run on automatic signalling system in the section.

“Now congestion of trains at Nagpur and Ajni stations will be reduced and waiting time for trains outside the station will also be less. The system will control movement of trains between the blocks using automatic signals. The new system consists of six automatic signals and four semi-automatic signals with axle counters along auto generation of SMS,” said DRM Somesh Kumar.

Kumar lauded the signal and telecom department for achieving the major milestone in providing the first automatic signalling system in Nagpur-Khapri section.

The commissioning took place in presence of ADRMs Manoj Tiwari and Jay Singh. Senior officials Ashutosh Shrivastav, Alok Kumar, YT Barapatre, NM Jambulkar, RS Kawde, MK Awadhi, SB Chawde, Ashay Dixit and P Ravikumar Rao.

What It Means?

*In automatic block working system movement of trains is controlled by automatic stop signals. These signals are operated automatically by passage of trains of automatic signalling sections

* The line is track circuited throughout its length and divided into a series of automatic signalling sections each of which is governed by an automatic stop signal

* The movement of trains is controlled by stop signals, which are operated automatically by the passage of trains past the signals

* No automatic signal goes ‘off’ unless the line is clear not only up to the stop signal ahead, but also an adequate distance beyond it

195,['22/03/2020'],Spl postal numismatic cover released,"Coimbatore: The city postal division in collaboration with philatelist and numismatist C Selvaraj released a special cover to mark the International Day of Forests on Saturday. Priced at Rs 350, this numismatic cover comes with a commemorative coin, a golden cancellation, a real wood veneer and a philately cancellation of a stamp released on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.

The colourfully designed cover has the potential to become a rare philately collectible for more than one reason. Sudhir Kumar Jakhere, senior superintendent of post offices, Coimbatore, said, “It contains an extremely rare 25 paisa commemorative coin that was released in 1985 with the lettering “forestry for development”. These coins are extremely rare and are sourced by Selvaraj. It also has real mahogany veneer of hardly 600-micron glued on to the cover, a golden cancellation of a postage stamp on the zoological survey of India and a cancelled stamp that was released on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji.”

The postal department has decided to print only 500 special covers for now and they will be available for sale at the philatelic bureau. While the cover alone is priced at Rs 350, the same is available in a special folder with Mahatma Gandhi’s quotes at Rs 700.

In addition, the postal department has also released a special pack of postcards with pictures of rare species of plants in the Western Ghats. The postcards are affixed with QR codes, which if scanned would tell us the exact location where the plant was photographed. “The postcards come in plain packs, cancelled packs and elite packs. The elite packs have a special green cancellation designed by INTACH,” Jakhere said.

The Coimbatore division is the only division in the state to release special covers with coins within a short period. “The concept behind this cover is Gandhian environmentalism, which focuses on minimalism, and not overexploitation of forests and natural resources. He advocated development with sustainable usage of natural resources, which was way ahead of his time,” Jakhere said.

JAIPUR: Amid the scare of Covid-19, the district administration of Pali has come up with an innovative idea to spread awareness about the pandemic. The administration is circulating cartoons and caricatures with messages and slogans on prevention of the infection, on various social networking groups in the city, and are also putting up posters and banners with these caricatures on them.A caricature artiste has also been hired to design and pen a series guiding the people on how cleanliness and hygiene, washing of hands, no hand shakes and no socializing, can prevent the outbreak of Covid-19. In one of the series, the caricature artist has also taken a jibe on the Kanika Kapoor episode.“In the era of social networking, these messages hit you harder. Today, when we have people using smartphones in the rural interiors of Rajasthan, we thought of doing something different. In one of our caricature series, there are three men standing and a Covid-19 cartoon is trying to shake hands. Responding to this, the three men are saying namaste, satshreakal and aadaab. Thus, the message comes across loud and clear,” said Dinesh Chand Jain, district collector, Pali while talking to TOI. “We want them to be interactive,” Jain added.These messages are being circulated in various social networking groups. “I first send it to my subordinate staff including the sub-divisional magistrates (SDM) and later I appeal them to circulate in their groups,” Jain added.In past one week, these caricatures are popular to an extent that they have gone beyond Pali and have been received by people living in Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jalore, Sirohi and Jodhpur districts of the state. “Our aim is to educate people, thus we came up with this idea,” he said.In these messages, the district administration is also circulating the control room numbers. “Our hospitals are on standby mode and everyday, we are appealing to the public to avoid visiting the places which are overcrowded, wash their hands regularly, and are also disinfecting public places,” he said.",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74755476,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-275646,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/covid-19-in-rajasthan-pali-administration-creating-awareness-with-caricatures/articleshow/74753593.cms

Representatives of the associations said they had wrote to Coimbatore MP P R Natarajan and Southern Railway general manager demanding a train from Mettupalayam or Coimbatore to Tambaram or Chennai. “We want more rail connectivity between Coimbatore and the delta regions via Pollachi and Dindigul,” said secretary of the Welfare Association of Rail Passengers in Pollachi Mohan Kumar, who is also a businessman.

“Many Udumalpet industries and farmers buy banana leaves and betel nuts and leaves from the delta region and vegetable traders can easily travel between Mettupalayam and Dindigul for buying and selling vegetables,” he said.

Such a train will fill a large void in the tourism and pilgrimage sector, said Kumar. “This train should pass through Palani and Kumbakonam, both of which are popular destinations for pilgrims and start and end at Mettupalayam, giving travellers in delta region easy connectivity to NMR and Ooty,” said Mohan Kumar.

President of the Thanjavur District Rail Users Association P K T Shanmugam agreed. “Every day, at least six government buses operate between Palani and Chidambaram. As many buses operate between Palani and Mayiladuthai, and Thanjavur. A special fare train will help the passengers because it is more convenient. Moreover, the railway will earn more revenue,” he said.

The train will also benefit the students of Annamalai University in Chidambaram based in Palani and Pollachi.

With more restrictions on vehicles from Karnataka and Kerala entering the Nilgiris, located on the trijunction of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, the district is cordoned off from the neighbouring states.

Except for vehicles carrying essential commodities such as milk, oil and ration items, those including light vehicles are not allowed to enter the hill district. However, exceptions are made for people coming to the Nilgiris on emergency purposes such as attending funeral.

According to the district administration, all passengers in the vehicles will be required to undergo the necessary medical scanning at the check posts. “Though there is a restriction on vehicles from Karnataka and Kerala to the Nilgiris, unmindful tourists still try to enter through the border check posts,” said a social activist.

Tourist vehicles are asked to return at Kakkanallah and Nadugani check posts.

Meanwhile, with no tourists in the Nilgiris, merchants and vendors said their business has shrunk at least by 50%. Shops including the 80 shops run by Tibetan refugees located near the Government Botanical Garden in Ooty have downed shutters since the last three days as they depend only on tourists.

“Now the business is based only on the local consumption.

206,['22/03/2020'],"Panic buying sets in as shops run out of masks, sanitizers","Coimbatore: Most of the pharmacies in the district have run out of masks and sanitizers, the demand for which has shot up with people running from pillar to post to store them in the hope of curbing the spread of Covid-19. Several pharmacies are now forced to turn down their customers, owing to lack of stock.

K Manimozhi, a pharmacist, said, “Masks, sanitizers, alcohol-based handrub and hand wash would be sold out within a few days of procurement. And then we have to wait for the arrival of fresh stock. This has been the situation ever since Covid-19 tension gripped the city in January-end. There is a huge demand for hand sanitizers as well and since stocks aren’t available people are going in for surgical spirit.”

Pointing out that the sale of masks was limited to 50 to 100 a day and that of sanitizers one or two till January, she said the demand has increased manifold since Covid-19 outbreak. “We are now selling more than 500 masks and 100 sanitizers a day.”

She said some people were buying sanitizers and masks in bulk quantities. “There are people who bought all the masks and sanitizers that were available in the shop at a time,” Manimozhi said recalling how she did a business of Rs 10,000 in a few hours.

Earlier, only health workers used to purchase alcohol-based handrub that too only a limited quantity. “I used to stock only five to six pieces. But today almost everyone is asking for handrub.”

Another pharmacist, Meenakshi, said the market was now flooded with several local brands and that a 500ml bottle of handrub was priced at Rs 600. “The high price and local brands are not a deterrent to the public, who continue to buy them.”

Meenakshi said she has been receiving endless phone calls asking for masks and hand sanitizers every day. “The demand might continue for another few weeks until the fear fades away.”

Pharmacist Christy, who owns a shop on Mettupalayam Road, said people were purchasing up to 300 masks and 15 to 20 hand sanitizers at a time. “The demand is for alcohol-based sanitizers. People are after particular varieties of them and are disappointed when they are not available. It takes a lot of lecturing to convince them all varieties of sanitizers and handrubs are equally good and only the percentage of alcohol in them differs,” she said.

MUMBAI: Health minister Rajesh Tope has asked government offices to minimize the use of air-conditioners to prevent the spread of Covid- 19 through air circulation. A circular to the effect has been released in Mantralaya too.

Coronavirus in India live updates

“We have asked all government offices to minimize the use of air-conditioner units as per World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines and Government of India advisory,” said Tope at his daily press briefing on Saturday. He added the guidelines suggest offices must use fans and keep windows and doors open for ventilation “as a virus’ life increases in low temperature and decreases in sunlight”.

It is said a virus can live longer in low temperatures. “A virus can stay for seven to eight hours in low temperatures but only for an hour to two in normal temperatures,’’ said Tope. “It could stay alive in an AC duct for long and through air circulation infect others,” said the minister as an explanation for asking government offices to use fans.

ACs were considered the main culprit for the quick spread of Covid-19 on Hawaiian cruise liner Diamond Princess where thousands of passengers tested positive.

Dr Shashank Joshi, dean of the Indian College of Physicians, said there has been a debate on whether higher temperatures can kill the virus. “The jury is still out there but there have been outbreaks in Australia and Singapore that have high temperatures,” said Dr Joshi.

Working in three shifts, the source said, the corporation workers have also been spraying disinfectants on bus stand premises, buses and at depots, railway station and other public gathering places. “Earlier, they used to disinfect temples and shopping complexes. Now that they are closed for public till March 31, they have been exempted.”

The source said the city corporation has set up screening centres at the airport, railway station and on court premises. “We are screening everyone for high temperature.”

The corporation workers had on Wednesday disinfected the premises of Nirmala College for Women at Race Course following a request to this effect from the college management. “We were concerned about the students, who were staying on the college premises, and we wanted to ensure their safety,” the source said.

Speaking to TOI, DCP (crime) Gajanan Rajmane claimed that the crime trend in city has seen a decreasing graph in last few days. “Even the criminals might be fearing the outbreak and that is why they are afraid to leave their home. Also several police officials are regularly patrolling in the sensitive areas, so the crime incidents must have decreased for that reason too,” the DCP said.

As the whole city is under lockdown, the shopkeepers are scared that their establishment might be targeted by anti-social elements.

Sources said, that the closure of bars and wine shops has also helped in decreasing the crime rate in city as alcohol tends to increase aggression among the anti-social elements which can lead to fights or other criminal intents.

In the last few days, other than few burglaries and two robberies no major cases were reported in city.

“At present, police is on high alert due to the Covid-19 outbreak, but we are also keeping our informants active to keep tabs on miscreants in the city. The crime analysis from last few days clearly shows that there has been a decrease in the crimes in city. However, if citizens have any concern or fear about the anti-social elements, we are here to help them,” Rajmane further said.

“We will take stringent action against any person who tries to disturb peace in the city as Section 144 (of CrPC) is also been imposed in city.” he said.

Netizens have offered to personally check on the families in the state capital and provide basic supplies as well as medicines. Ashish Arora, who runs an automobile workshop, says, “Older people are advised to stay home to prevent catching the virus. There are many old people in the city whose family members are not living with them. We offer them help by shopping groceries from local stores, medicines and other household stuff.”

Soon, it became clear that the need for grocery delivery across the city was widespread, Arora on Saturday posted it on a social networking site in the hopes of expanding his movement. “I am glad, more than 25 people are willing to assist the elderly. If there are people like these in different areas of the city, more people can be helped without much travel,” Arora said.

Purchase of medicines and grocery might seem like routine chores, but it’s a task for many elderly after the advisory was issued in the city. People have to travel distances as all items are not available on one shop.

Rishi Singh, who is on a break from hotel management classes, too, is spearheading a free grocery delivery programme for old and needy who are at risk for contracting the novel virus. “So far, I have helped two people in Jaipur. I read an article on internet and copied the idea from the US, where students took the initiative and helped elderly people in this situation. After I posted it on my Facebook, I received two calls from friends living in different states,” Singh said.

Meanwhile, elderly people who have bought items on their own, requested the government to announce senior citizen hours in the shops to provide safe environment. Urmila Kumari, a resident of Vaishali Nagar says, “In other countries, a time slot for senior citizens was dedicated at stores so that they can buy stuff comfortably and it is the need of the hour for the same to be replicated here.”

The goat shandy is held at Gundarapalli village in Krishnagiri district every year, a week before Telugu New year and celebrated on March 25.

However, the district administration has banned the shandy this year as a Covid-19 preventive measure to avoid mass gathering.

Gundarapalli village is situated close to Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka state borders.

“Nearly 75,000 goats and sheep is sold in that shandy and the total business usually crosses Rs 10 crore,” M Jayaraman, one of the merchants told TOI. He also said that, the goat shandy is the biggest and a famous one in the district.

On Friday morning, the goat and sheep owners, merchants started gathering at the shandy place at Gundarapalli. The officials from the district administration who came to know about this, chased all the owners and merchants away with their goats and sheep.

“I have brought 200 goats from Mecheri in Salem district and spent nearly Rs 10,000 for transportation. If I go back, I have to spend another Rs 10,000 which is a loss of Rs 20,000 . “So, I have started selling my goats on the roadside for meagre rate to minimise my loss,” M Kalidoss, a merchant said.

The goat and sheep owners and merchants have come from across the state and were unsuccessful in convincing the officials.

Assistant collector Deivanayaki, who was monitoring the situation said there was no option but to close the shandy due to Covid-19.

Finally, the sellers decided to sell their goats and sheep from outside the shandy ground. One goat which is usually sold for Rs 3,000 in the shandy was sold for Rs 1,800 as the villagers refused to give the demanded money. The merchants who didn’t have any option, sold the goats for meagre rates.

In his address to the nation on Thursday night, Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged citizens across the country to observe ‘janata curfew’ by not stepping out of their homes from 7 am to 9 am on Sunday.

Chief public relations officer of SCR, Ch Rakesh, said, “It is noticed that, in several instances, passengers who have been medically advised to remain in quarantine on the suspicion of Covid-19 symptoms, are travelling by trains instead of staying at home or in quarantine facilities. Such people have been detected on various routes and rushed to the nearest medical institutions en route,”

249,['22/03/2020'],"People told to avoid repeated visits to fuel stations, pumps to remain open","Aurangabad: The Petrol and Diesel Association (PDA), Aurangabad, has appealed to people to get their vehicles filled to the capacity of the fuel tank so as to avoid frequent visits to the petrol pump.

The rush at petrol pumps had slightly increased on Saturday evening, they said.

At a time when the government has issued an advisory asking people to avoid large gatherings and crowding at public places, the sudden rush at petrol pumps in the city is a reason for worry, said PDA authorities.

They said that since fuel is an essential commodity, petrol pumps in the city will continue to work. However, the rush of people not only pose a threat to fellow motorists but also to the staff at fuel stations.

Aqueel Abbas, PDA secretary, said, “The current footfall at petrol pumps puts everybody’s health at risk.”

According to PDA, those having two-wheelers are advised to fill petrol of at least Rs 200 at one go, Rs 300 for three-wheelers and full tank for four-wheelers.

For rickshaws running on diesel, it is recommended that petrol worth Rs 300 should be filled at one go. Transport lorries have been recommended to fill petrol worth Rs 1,000 and full tank for buses and trucks.

This move will restrict frequent visits of people at fuel stations, the association members said.

Petrol pump owners said that practising these recommendations on a usual basis will also ensure reduction in overall fuel costs, time and additional trips to the fuel station.

According to motor mechanic Raees Siddiqui, he has been saving Rs 300 to Rs 500 a month since he has started to fill his motorcycle’s fuel tank to its capacity. “If you fill the tank to its full capacity, there is a reduction in evaporation and less fuel is exhausted,” Siddiqui said.

Meanwhile, petrol pump owners have appealed to the people not to indulge in panic purchasing as fuel stations fall under essential commodities category and the retail outlets will remain open even during the shutdown.

The SCB had been struggling for more than a decade to identify suitable land.

The decision to allot defence land for dumpyard was taken during board meeting on Saturday. “President of cantonment board (PCB), Brigadier Abhijit Chandra, replied to a query on this issue raised during the meeting,” SCB deputy CEO, Vijay Kumar Balan Nair, said.

Nair also said that currently, the open area of Mahatma Gandhi Community Hall at Trimulgherry is being used as dumpyard for more than three years and is likely to be shifted to the newly identified defence land in a month. However, Trimulgherry residents held protests over shifting of dumpyard and SCB ward member Bhagya Shree also raised the issue in board meetings.

About other decisions, Balan Nair said, “The PCB decided to convene a special meeting next week to tackle water problems in ensuing summer and asked SCB ward members to come up with proposals and plan of action. Members of wards III, V and VI had raised the water problem.”

As per the Ministry of Defence (MoD) instructions, new Cantonment Board Account Rules, 2020, will be implemented in SCB from April 1. Till date, we were implementing the Cantonment Account Code, 1924, during process of accounts systems. A software will also be developed for the preparation and maintenance of accounting records under the double entry based accrual method, he added.

Earlier, SCB CEO SVR Chandra Sekhar said the Board has sanctioned a building plan to construct a new building at Karkhana. On March 16, a building collapsed while it was being demolished and led to death of a person. In fact, SCB has imposed a penalty of Rs 2 lakh for flouting the Cantonment Act rules and regulations in demolition of the structure.

ERODE: Forest officials attached to Asanur forest division in the district are filling ponds in the Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve ( STR ) to help wild animals quench thirst and prevent them from straying into human habitats in search of water this summer.

Officials with Thalavadi, Asanur, Kermalam and Jeerahalli forest ranges said they have been taking water from various parts of the district to the ponds in STR through trucks.

Pointing out that all the water bodies in STR had gone dry due to scorching heat in the district, K Sivakumar, forest ranger, Thalavadi forest range, said due to water shortage animals had started entering the villages and hamlets that were close to the tiger reserve.

“Animals like elephants, deer, bears, Indian gaurs and leopards would come out of STR if the ponds don’t have sufficient water for them. If enough water and fodder are available in the forest, they are unlikely to stray into the plains.”

The official said instances of man-animal conflict would intensify if animals were to stray into the plains. “This could be avoided if the water bodies have sufficient water. We will refill the water bodies twice a week.”

He said they were also monitoring the movement of animals using CCTV cameras.

Wild animals are mostly found in T N Palayam, Thalavadi, Bargoor, Asanur, Dhimbam and Bhavanisagar forest ranges in the district.

AURANGABAD: The Kranti Chowk police have booked a city-based pharmacist on late Friday night on the charges of cheating after he was caught red-handed by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) while repacking and relabelling of sanitisers.

They also slapped relevant sections of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940 on him. The complaint was lodged by Varsha Mahajan (39).

FDA authorities said that the received a tip-off about the repacking of sanitisers in small containers and illegally pasting of fresh stickers on them. Following the tip-off, the team rushed to Samarthnagar-based pharmacy store ‘Sohanda Medicos’ on March 16. They raided the place only to find that sterillium hand disinfectant was being repacked in smaller containers without due permission or knowledge of the appropriate authorities.

FDA team also found that the stickers being labelled on the repacked containers did not have all the mandatory details of the product including license number, date of manufacturing, date of expiry, packing size, manufacturer’s name, address and other relevant details.

The probe that followed the raid revealed that the pharmacist had purchased large quantity of sterillium disinfectant and considering the sudden surge in demand for sanitisers, was allegedly refilling smaller containers of 50 ml each and labelling them for selling them in open market.

A complaint in this regard was lodged by Prashant Dattuprasad Sarosiya (40), a resident of the Kelibazar area of the city.

Sources said that no arrests have been made so far. The process of collecting all official records from the RTO office would begin from Monday, following which role of each suspect named in the case would be ascertained before the process to arrest them is initiated.

According to sources, Sarosiya had given the said car to an acquaintance on rental basis. The vehicle was registered in his father’s name. It was recently after his father’s death that Sarosiya tried to get the vehicle back, but the person who had rented it, began avoiding him.

Suspecting his behaviour, Sarosiya reached out to the RTO office to check for the records of the vehicle. At the time, he found out that the person had allegedly forged Sarosiya’s deceased father’s signatures and got the vehicle transferred in connivance with the RTO official and one more person. Left with no option, the man approached the police.

261,['22/03/2020'],Centre assesses damage to tourism &amp; hospitality industry,"Aurangabad: The Centre has initiated steps to assess the damage caused to the tourism industry in the region by the Covid-19 outbreak.

The tourism ministry has approached important bodies such as the Federation of Associations in Indian Tourism & Hospitality (FAITH), Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO), Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) for the survey.

“The relief measures for the tourism and hospitality industry — to overcome the impact of Covid-19 — have been examined by the ministry. Additional information is required to quantify the damage in financial terms,” Meenakshi Mehta, the deputy director general with the tourism ministry, said in a letter to the travel and tourism bodies.

The Centre has sought details on loan exposure of tour operators and travel agents to ascertain and quantify the amounts involved.

It has also sought details on quantification of interest of loans sought for rebuilding tourism and hospitality-related businesses and a doubling of overdraft facility.

These details are expected to be compiled by March 23. In addition, the Centre has also sought clarification on statutory compliances required for tour operators and transport operators. The postponement of these could benefit the industry.

Jaswant Singh, the president of the Tourism Promoters’ Guild, said the Aurangabad Tourism Development Foundation has urged the ministries of tourism and finance to bail out the stakeholders.

“We need an immediate moratorium of 12 months on loans, EMIs and a deferment of statutory taxes such as GST and corporate tax. Aurangabad, known as the tourism capital of Maharashtra, has been hit hard by the Covid-19 outbreak. Many tourist sites are now closed,” he said.

262,['22/03/2020'],Spectators play a role too in the theatre of cricket,"BENGALURU: It isn’t uncommon to hear of enriched spectator experience at mega sporting events. Media and technology have been augmenting the fan’s engagement with the game not only when he’s at home, but also when he’s at the venue. Elaborate opening and closing ceremonies, giant screens showing highlights and replays or live analyses and statistics on your phones have helped the cricket-lover. After all, everybody, even the TV viewer, loves a packed stadium with exuberant fans because it adds to his thrill.

Long before the cricket buff watched the game on his mobile phone or television set, there was immense joy of seeing the action live or listening to “running commentary” on the radio. The generation that has witnessed many contests at the Central College Grounds – or even from the early 1970s when the matches shifted to Chinnaswamy Stadium – will vouch they got their money’s worth, under the bamboo shades.

The spectator of the 1960s and 70s was more of a student of the game. Everything about his routine was diligent and punctilious: packing his paraphernalia consisting of a cloth cap, a thermos flask filled with coffee, water bottle, pocket transistor and a pair of binoculars; meticulous filling up of score sheets; the laborious shelling of groundnuts; husky shouts mixed with ululations and of course, his awestruck wonderment at the flannelled men. Going to the games was a ritual, a community activity that involved an early morning bath, long waits in queues hours before the first ball was bowled, settling down with friends or family for a quick breakfast as soon as they could grab a place. The older members enjoyed the privilege of the binoculars and the youngsters, ears cocked to the radio commentary, pencilled in the scores. On the return journey home when everyone was tired and brown as a berry, the young ones sportingly lugged the baggage, sometimes freeing their hands to rehearse a Jaisimha drive. The cricket remained for days; an imitation GRV square cut could slice the air frequently. Perhaps more commonly than trying out Dev Anand’s sloping gait or Clint Eastwood’s quiet saunter.

In the gallery where many had to watch the game standing on aching legs, the mood was lifted every time there was good cricket. When a drive came crashing in to the boundary, spoons drummed on tiffin boxes and feet shuffled in excitement, leaving an eddy of dust over fine leg. Yet if you rubbed your eyes, it was also in amazement.

Down history, specifically during the Bombay Quadrangular (1912-1936), cricket was a happening event for privileged class. As Australian historian Richard Cashman wrote in “The Indian Crowd”, it was where social distinctions could be seen. “While the less privileged squatted on the ground, sat on chairs, or on the overhanging branches of trees in Bombay, the elite graced the shamianas or remained in the carriages which lined the eastern boundary having been shunted there the night before,” he said.

Even earlier, in 1895 when the Presidency (the Europeans) played the Parsis, newspaper reports spoke of a clear segregation of the spectators: the military on one side, European and Parsi ladies on another and on yet another, “a motley crowd of natives”. Writing about the carnival-like atmosphere of the Pentagular series, Cashman describes a self-appointed Parsi entertainer called Charlie who amused the crowd when action on the field was dull. Charlie was known to even rush to the ground to garland players, but never disturbed the game.

That was an era when appreciation was largely subdued and discreet. A reminder of village cricket in England where the only occasional cries were that of “Howzat!” from the close-in cordon and a soft chorus of Oohs and Aahs or “Catch it” from the crowd. The most pleasant one was of “Bowlingggg” after a near-miss of the bat.

Decades later, you heard of crowd frenzy that included a couple of incidents in Bangalore too. In February, 1969, the Central College Grounds hosted a semi-final Ranji Trophy match between Mysore and Bengal. Mysore, needing 222 to win, collapsed to 20 for 6, and suddenly after tea, a section of irate spectators, flung missiles, broke chairs and dug up the pitch. What sparked the rioting apart from the pathetic display of batting was the umpire’s decision to give Budhi Kunderan out. Many thought that the Mysore opener, who had shaped defensively at a Subroto Guha outswinger, hadn’t nicked it to the keeper. Play was abandoned.

Old-timers talk of other overwhelming memories of the Central College ground – among them, watching Bill Lawry’s star-studded Aussie team playing South Zone in 1969 or a Central Zone vs South Zone match in 1967 which saw Budhi Kunderan and Salim Durrani blazing away. Newspapers carried an interesting snippet of the first match about an amateur trumpeter in the schools gallery who played pop music and earned Ian Chappell’s admiration.

On their part, the two students have to participate in service activities like feeding the poor at Sri Ramakrishna Seva Samithi, Hanamkonda, for two months.

On Oct 26, 2019, the two students consumed ganja and were caught by the security personnel. Subsequently, they were suspended from college for 2019-20. They were barred from attending classes and taking examinations. A penalty of Rs 1 lakh was slapped on each of them as well. Later, the senate confirmed the decision of the officials, which was challenged before the high court by the students and their parents.

While agreeing with the argument of the varsity that discipline is something that cannot be compromised, the judge, however, pointed out certain discrepancies in the varsity’s version of the story. On one hand, NIT said that the two students admitted their guilt, gave an undertaking that they would not commit such a mistake again and even urged the authorities to forgive them. Having said so, the authorities said in their suspension order that they found no remorse in the conduct of the students. The judge, however, rejected the allegation of the students that the authorities were biased against them.

The judge also sent out a stern message to the erring students, by agreeing with NIT to some extent and asked the two students to stay out of the campus.

Nearly 134 of the total 174 teachers have been transferred to the property tax department while 20 to census department and the remaining 20 to the advertisement/market department.

The NMC has 366 surplus teachers. Chances of a similar transfer of the remaining surplus teachers in the coming days cannot be ruled out.

The NMC has 3,000 sanctioned teachers. At present, 1,121 teachers are active. As per the state government’s norms, there should be two teachers for 60 students followed by one teacher for the next 30 students.

The NMC is running 131 primary schools, higher primary schools and 29 secondary schools. The strength of students is 18,000. As per the teacher-student ratio, the NMC requires only 755 teachers.

Still, the NMC is maintaining 1,121 teachers for last six years. It means the NMC is maintaining 366 surplus teachers for last six years. Despite cash-strapped conditions, the civic body is bearing salaries of over Rs 22 crore per annum on surplus teachers.

In February, Mundhe came to know about this and directed education department to shortlist surplus teachers and send to state’s education department. But the state’s education department is yet to reply to the NMC’s request to incorporate surplus teachers in their service.

To reduce financial burden, now Mundhe started to transfer surplus teachers in departments facing staff crunch.

NMC teachers union which strongly opposed transfer of surplus teachers to state’s education department has also registered an objection on shifting surplus teachers to other departments in the NMC.

269,['22/03/2020'],Large crowd at ‘Panguni’ fest despite Covid-19 warning,"MADURAI: While bigger temples have been closed as a precautionary measure against Covid-19, smaller temples managed by the HR & CE department and those in villages where thousands gather at a time are continuing to conduct their annual ‘Panguni’ festival, showing that people are still unaware of the lurking danger.On Friday night, over 1,000 people participated in the Panguni festival of Veerakaliamman temple near Melur. The people took out a procession to the temple carrying idols in decorated palanquins. ``We are doing it for the good of the world and the health of the community,’’ said Selvam, a participant, saying that this was an annual festival that no family usually wanted to miss.Pongal was also cooked on the premises and distributed to the people who came there. While the government’s directive to bar devotees is in place for bigger temples, the festivals in smaller temples are going to draw larger crowds. While the district administration and local body administrations are taking many steps to create awareness of hand hygiene in markets, bus stands, stations and other public places, no awareness was created at this specific temple festival.Meanwhile, a small temple at Maravar Chavadi in Madurai conducted a ‘yaga’ seeking protection against the fast-spreading Covid-19 virus. ``A large number of people also gathered there and it was clear that they did not give much thought to social distancing while participating in this puja,’’ said Krishnan of Arapalayam. The Thayamangalam festival in Sivaganga is another temple that draws lakhs of people from various parts of the state for the Panguni festival and the culminating event is to be held on Sunday. Sivaganga district collector J Jayakanthan said that he would look into the issue.Thousands gathered there on Saturday when a large number of goats and chickens were sacrificed. As there is a water scarcity in the temple, thousands entered the village tank simultaneously for bathing after tonsuring their heads. Though the temple is under the control of the HR & CE department, there was no effort to control the crowds on Saturday. If not closed, the temple could draw a larger crowd on Sunday during the Janta curfew and lead to the failure of the attempt to combat the deadly virus.",madurai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74758039,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-434789,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/big-crowds-turn-up-at-small-temple-fests/articleshow/74752794.cms

Pitchi was the only flower that sold for Rs 200 as the supply was low on Saturday. Samangi, Arali and Chendupoo sold for as less as Rs 20 per kg.Flower farmers, traders and vendors, too, come under the agrarian community, like their counterparts, who cultivate paddy, pulses and other condiments. “While, their produce would stay for some time, our products become dry and withered in a day. It has hit farmers and traders because the banks that loaned us will start pressuring us by March 31, this is the first time that we are facing uncertainty of this magnitude,” he said.",madurai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74758170,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-365958,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/flower-market-to-shut-after-50-years/articleshow/74752786.cms

Seven people who were admitted earlier at MGM have tested negative for Covid-19 on Saturday. Collector S Sivarasu has hinted that MGM may soon have a Covid-19 testing facility.

Out of 458 passengers who landed at the Trichy international airport on five flights from Sharjah, Dubai and Singapore, 34 passengers including 25 men and nine women have been diagnosed with mild cough and cold.

272,['22/03/2020'],Indore to get new parking protocol with help from UK,"Indore: Don’t be surprised if down the years, Indore’s traffic and parking management system becomes like London. Giving a videshi touch to city streets, civic body is preparing a ‘parking management policy’ in association with United Kingdom government under UK-India ‘Strategic Partnership’ for Smart Urban Development in Indian States (SmUDI).

The initiative aims at effective utilization of parking spaces, reducing dependency on private vehicles and increase ridership of public transport. “The parking management policy focuses on five broad guiding principles. Under each guiding principle, several initiatives will be taken to increase parking turnover, allocate appropriate space for road users, reduce demand for parking, increase ridership of public transport and reduce traffic congestion,” Indore civic body commissioner Asheesh Singh told TOI.

Under the new policy, people might soon have to pay for parking their vehicles at public places like open grounds, gardens or even on roads in front of their houses.

“These initiatives will be implemented in phases as it will require understanding of citizens’ acceptability and modifications in strategy if needed,” he said, adding that provision regarding collection of charges from citizens if they use public spaces such as roads, public ground or garden for parking vehicles have also been made in the policy.

“A final decision in this regard is yet to be taken as it also requires permission from state government,” commissioner said.

He said that corporation plans to implement the system on trial in certain areas of city and if all goes well IMC would pitch for making provisions to incorporate the plan in its bylaws. “The main idea is to encourage people to shun use of private vehicles and opt for public transport, especially in areas with heavy traffic pressure,” he said.

Officials said that they are identifying potential areas in city for implementation and enforcement of the parking management system.

“Areas with maximum parking demand and presence of commercial establishments will be given priority for successful implementation of the plan,” said Ashwani Lamba, an official associated with the project.

On-street parking and no parking zones would also be introduced in certain areas for proper implementation of the plan, he added.

MADURAI: Combined efforts by the marine police and the forest department in Tuticorin led to the seizure of 164kg processed sea cucumber in different incidents on Saturday. Forester S Arun Kumar said the stock was about two to three months old and suspected to be left over that could not be smuggled due to the Covid-19 crisis.

It is smuggled to Sri Lanka, from where it used to be sent to China and Thailand . Marine police raided a godown at K V K Nagar in Tuticorin based on a tip off. Police seized 70kg of the processed sea cucumber that was stored in four bags and also seized a gas cylinder used in the process.

Vadodara: If you thought panic was limited to buying of essential commodities, hand sanitizers and masks, think again. For trigger factors also include the foreign returned people in Bayan City, who are now at the receiving end of people’s heightened worries.

So much so, that the virus-wary Barodians have been keeping authorities on their toes with phones buzzing constantly with information about people whom they find suspicious in their neighbourhood!

On Saturday morning itself, major drama ensued at Sukhdham Residency on Waghodia-Dabhoi ring road where a youth from Bhavnagar put himself under self quarantine after returning from Spain. The youth, a student in Spain, had landed at Mumbai airport a few days back and had kept himself in self-quarantine at his relative’s vacant home in the society. When the residents of the society learnt about him, they forcefully sent him to a government quarantine centre at Ajwa Road.

“On Friday evening we learnt about the youth staying here and enquired from the owner about his details. When he told us we became alert as the youth, although in self-quarantine, had been staying in society which could affect all of us,” said the president of the society, Jagdish Sharma.

Sharma added that the man had been ordering food through online services and disposing garbage along with waste from other houses of the society. “He had not got himself tested and doesn’t know whether he has any symptoms or not. So, we called an ambulance on Saturday morning,” said Sharma, a retired Indian Railways employee.

When the ambulance arrived, the youth hid himself in the house, but after much deliberation, was taken away forcefully to an isolation centre.

A businessman living in Harni alerted Vadodara Municipal Corporation on Twitter when he learnt through hearsay that a daughter of his neighbour was planning to come to the city from Ahmedabad. The businessman Pankaj Gupta told TOI: “She is under self-isolation at her relative’s house in Ahmedabad after returning from Dubai. Her mother and a cousin went to Ahmedabad and they are all planning to return to Vadodara on Monday.”

Such hoax alarms are sending VMC officials in a tizzy.

On Friday, deputy mayor Jivraj Chauhan said that a call was received from eastern part of city which informed the officials that a couple in a residential apartment has returned from abroad and has come out of the house for two days. When health officials reached the house, they came to know that they had voluntarily decided to stay in isolation nor had travelled to any foreign country.

Not only VMC, but the police control room too has been flooded with alarm calls from different parts of the city with reports about people violating guidelines of self-quarantine. “We ask people to call the government helpline 104 in case they find any suspicious violation because we can hardly do anything regarding these complaints,” said assistant commissioner of police (control room) Vimal Gamit. On Saturday too, police control room received several calls from Waghodia Road and Bhayli areas.

Dehradun: Just six months after a cemented stretch was built at the EC Road by Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority (MDDA), it has started causing inconvenience to the locals of the area. Those who live in the locality say that drainage arrangements were neglected while laying of the road.

“After much requests, the road was built in October, last year. However, its design is faulty and the quality is sub-standard. Rain water gets stagnated and doesn’t trickle down due to lack of sewage provisions. The leveling of the road isn’t proper. Also, only 550 metre-long road was built despite the sanction for a 630 metre-long road,” said DC Chandola, president of residents welfare association.

The locals allege that the survey before construction of the road was not done properly, as a consequence of which, water and other waste does not flow in the direction of main drainage.

RK Agarwal, a local, told TOI, “Around 3-foot-deep water got collected outside our homes after rain spells earlier this month. The water logging makes it difficult for us to even move out of our homes.”

Another resident of the area Kaushal Madan said, “The quality of the road can be ascertained from the fact that the gravels have started coming out of the road making it slippery for commuters and causing accidents.”

The residents say that many people who own cars are forced to park their vehicles on the road as the stretch doesn’t reach their home. “Had the MDDA constructed a road of the sanctioned length, such problems would not exist,” said a local.

Meanwhile, Abhishek Bhardwaj, assistant engineer of MDDA, said “The road ensures that rain water flows in the direction of the drainage. The stretch was built with the sanctioned budget of Rs 51.23 lakh and the contractor was paid only after verifying the quality of the road.”

Public health and preventive medicine department organised a training programme at the district collector office on Sunday at which 70 members of women self-help groups (SHGs) of Magalir Thittam learnt how to produce hand sanitizer.

Head of the microbiology department at K A P Viswanatham government medical college, Dr S Dhanapal, taught them the formula of mixing isoprophyl alcohol, glycerol, hydrogen peroxide and distilled water at the prescribed ratio to make the hand sanitizers. The formula for preparing one litre to 25 litres of sanitizers, procedures and safety measures to be followed were imparted to the attendees. The microbiology chief also listed out the containers required for the mixing.

“Since masks and sanitizers are required in abundance, the SHGs have been trained to make them on their own,” said collector S Sivarasu after inaugurating the training session. Assistant project officer of Magalir Thittam Julius Theodar said the SHG members will prepare 20 litres of sanitizer at the district supply and marketing society office in Trichy from Monday. It will be supplied to the health centres according to the directions of the district collector.

To start with, Magalir Thittam will help SHG members with funds and raw materials. Later, the SHG members will be taking care of the project on their own. Julius said the hand sanitizer-making project will help the members financially and make the item available in the market at a reasonable price also. “Not everyone is required to wear a mask and use hand sanitizers. Proper hand washing using soaps will do,” he told reporters at a press meet. While urban people were sensitized about hand washing by the corporation officials, block development officers (BDO) have been asked to meet the rural people in the evening and sensitize them about hand washing before going for work and after returning home, said the collector. Public health and preventive medicine department also got the head of the department of microbiology at MGMGH to provide training to the SHG women at the collector office on Saturday.

Dr Ashok Arbat, president of VHA said that emergency services will continue in all hospitals.

“Hospitals attached to VHA have stopped regular health check-up visits and also postponed the planned surgeries for the time being. Now, we have appealed all hospitals and nursing homes to keep their OPDs closed and ask patients not to come for regular check-ups,” he said. Most corporate private hospitals in city are attached to VHA.

“Private hospitals are committed to provide their services to the government authorities to fight the coronavirus outbreak. We are constantly in touch with the government authorities,” he said.

Dr Arbat also advised patients those who want to visit hospitals or clinics from March 21 onwards for their regular check-ups to avoid if it’s not very necessary. “In case it becomes necessity, you should call the doctor and ensure whether the OPD is functioning or not,” he added.

The VHA has ensured that they are ready to cooperate with the government authorities by providing any technical or human resource support at the quarantine facilities. VHA has already given a proposal to hand over one entire hospital with less occupancy to government and develop it as ‘Quarantine hospital’.

Meanwhile, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has started ‘Talk to Doctor’ 24X7 helpline for patients. “Patients may call 9999672238 & 9999672239 and speak to doctor round the clock.

301,['22/03/2020'],Students coming back for an early &amp; forced vacation,"A hoarding requesting people to participate in janata curfew being put up at Badkas Chowk on Saturday

Nagpur: As various cities in Maharashtra as well as the country start shutting down, those enrolled in colleges there have started coming back for an early vacation.

A student, who returned from Vellore (Tamil Nadu), said, “It was difficult to book tickets from a small town at the eleventh hour. I wasn’t really scared about getting infected but the friends I travelled with were. We were informed on March 15 evening that the institute will shut down from the next day, so there was panic among students.”

A student who returned from Dharwad (Karnatake) said his return journey was a long one. “I had to first travel all the way to Belgaum. From there, I took a flight to Mumbai and then another flight to Nagpur. I wasn’t scared of getting infected because panicking in such situations won’t work. You simply need to take preventive measures,” said the student.

Another student who came back from Pune said she was lucky as travelling was not a hassle at all. “My sister and I returned early by train, so getting a ticket was not an issue. But throughout the journey we kept our faces covered because in the train, it’s very easy to catch any infection,” she said.

A student, who returned from Mumbai, said that though she is back, it’s shocking to see how casually people are taking the situation.

“People are extremely careless regarding the issue which is why I was a bit scared about getting infected while travelling. We must take precautions while travelling,” she said.

Another student from Pune said the college is still communicating with them. “We are keeping in touch through the college’s web site as all the information is being updated there,” she said.

A Bengaluru college student said that technology is helping them to keep in touch. “My college is commuting via texts and e-mails. But looking at the brighter side, I’m spending a lot of quality time with my parents,” he said.

A student from Pune said their college is now providing every support possible through mobile apps. “Our college is constantly in touch with us through whatsapp. We are even appearing for our exams online,” said the student.

Another student from Bengaluru said that they are making up for the academic loss by doing multiple home assignments. “Academic loss is something everyone is worried about, but all of us are making the maximum use of this leave by studying and preparing for the exams. There are chances that the college might start online classes, but for now, they are updating us with a separate college application,” said the student.

302,['22/03/2020'],T Students Storm London High Commission,"Hyderabad/London: Around 60 Indian students -- most of them from Telangana -- created a ruckus at the High Commission of India (HCI) in London on Friday night, demanding that they be sent back to India in the wake of escalation in novel coronavirus fear. On Saturday, some of them had left. However, 28 students stayed put at the HCI building.

The students, who stood outside the HCI building all day on Friday carrying their suitcases, refused to leave the premises and spent the night on the floor in the passport and visa section. They insisted they did not have any place to go.

“We contacted some hotels and found them accommodation in two and three-star hotels at £10 per night. Most of them belong to Telangana and south India,” a senior Indian diplomat told STOI. “Despite that, they stayed put and entered the premises. They want to be repatriated to India. Since no flight can land in India, it is not possible to send them,” he said.

The protesting students claimed their hostels had closed and they did not have money to stay in London. “We offered them alternative accommodation, but they want to stay put in the High Commission. We have got no evidence that hostels have closed,” the diplomat said.

“The visa section has a huge floor where they are sleeping,” the diplomat said. The staff had already sealed access to the rest of the HCI building. “We do not want to evict them because they are Indian nationals. The canteen is closed over the weekend, so they will have to fend for themselves,” he said.

In a video message sent to STOI, the agitated students said London was already in a shutdown mode and there was no facility to conduct a coronavirus test on them. Mirza, a student from Hyderabad, said: “Please rescue us.”

Another student said if the government of India could arrange a special flight to airlift students from Rome, it could as well airlift them from the UK. “We are readyto cooperate with the authorities for self-quarantine once we land in India. Please fly us back,” they said in a letter to Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao.

Meanwhile, the Indian diplomat said the students could leave the building and come back later. He said they were worried about health scare. “There are no showers. This is not sustainable in the long run. They could be spreading coronavirus. I hope in a few days, they will move on. There are not many visas we are handling now but this undermines the security of the building,” he said.

He said some of them were student leaders who “seem to be getting assistance from a political side.”

DEHRADUN: Three persons, including an engineer involved in construction of the all-weather road for the central government’s Char Dham project, were killed after boulders fell on them. The incident took place in Chada area on the Bardinath highway route in the early hours of Saturday. According to police, all three bodies have been retrieved from the debris and there is minimal possibility of more casualties.

Mountain and rock cutting work is currently underway for broadening of the Badrinath road. With the Char Dham yatra scheduled to start around April-end, authorities are ensuring round-the-clock work on the route. The boulders fell on the Pokland machine being used in the construction work, damaging it badly. Machines had to be used to remove the debris and pull out the bodies. The deceased have been identified as Himanshu Singh (junior engineer), Pankaj Singh and Rakesh Kumar. While Himanshu and Pankaj are from Chamoli district, Kumar was a resident of Himachal Pradesh.

Following the accident , traffic was diverted on the Kothyalsain-Nandprayag road. Officials said that the debris would soon be removed and route would open in a short time.

Notably, this is not the first accident during the ongoing all-weather road project in the state. In the past too, deaths have been reported due to works on the project which aims to widen the highways leading to the Char Dham shrines. In a major accident in December 2018, seven labourers were killed and four others sustained injuries after they were trapped in the landslides while working on the project. The accident was reported in Rudraprayag district of Garhwal .

In March 2019, two persons were killed in a landslide while they were working on the all-weather Road project in Tehri district of Garhwal.

The accident occurred near Nagni on Chamba-Rishikesh stretch of the all-weather project when an operator and a helper were using the Pokland machine on the road construction site and a sudden landslide brought down silt and boulders on the machine.

305,['22/03/2020'],3 years of Uttarakhand government: How has tourism minister fared?,"DEHRADUN: One of the senior-most ministers in the Trivendra Singh Rawat cabinet, tourism minister Satpal Maharaj’s tenure has seen an increase in tourist inflow in the state but at the same time, many of his announcements meant to bolster the tourism scenario — like introducing submarines and seaplanes in Tehri lake, starting over half a dozen ropeway projects as well as developing a new destination in each of the 13 districts — have either remained non-starters or have moved at a snail’s pace.

Defending the initiatives taken and work done by him, Maharaj told TOI, “It takes time for a project to be completed, especially in the hills. The work is on for several projects like Tehri lake development, ropeways and homestays. The change will definitely be visible in the next two years.”

He added that “ever since BJP came to power in March 2017, there has been a substantial increase in the number of tourists visiting the state with the Char Dham Yatra last year registering a record turnout of 32 lakh pilgrims.” “Encouraged by the positive response, the state government has given tourism the status of an industry in the state. From planning and preparation stage, we have now moved towards implementation stage where a number of tenders have been awarded and work on many projects have been started,” the minister said, adding that the tourism department has set a target to have 5,000 homestays in the state — up from the present 2,100 — by this year-end.

Meanwhile, tourism industry professionals had mixed views on the initiatives taken by the tourism department. Chain Singh Rawat, trekking and mountaineering operator at Sankri village in Uttarkashi said that while the government had initiated some good schemes, which helped increase the number of tourists in the hill state, there had been no concurrent attempt to bolster infrastructure facilities like road, electricity and communication which were erratic in many tourist places.

As for the homestay scheme, he said that “most people, particularly villagers of remote villages, are not getting the benefit of homestays and other subsidised schemes of government, due to the difficult documentation process and non-cooperation of concerned departments.” “The tourism department should frame a proper tourism policy maybe on the lines of Himachal Pradesh so that the benefits are able to reach those for whom they are intended,” Rawat said.

In a similar vein, Dinesh Bhatt, president of rafting and camping association of Rishikesh, said, “The tourism department has taken steps to boost the sector but there are several key issues pending. In Rishikesh for instance, the camping and rafting business has declined, simply because there is no clear rafting policy drafted by the government — even though NGT, while banning riverside camping along the Ganga, had asked for a policy to be drafted. The result is that tourists are now moving to other states for camping. This could have been avoided.""

306,['22/03/2020'],Hyderabad: Residents take up social media campaign on staying home,"People post pics on Instagram

HYDERABAD: In an attempt to spread awareness on importance of social distancing, a few residents started a social media campaign. “Sometimes, all it takes is a little nudge for people to actually follow instructions. This was the idea behind starting #HydCoronaStopKaroNa challenge,” said Namrata Sadhvani, who along with fellow instagrammer Sunpreet N Sinha, started the campaign.

Inspired by Instagram posts by @dudewithsign to help fight the pandemic, Sinha said, “When the PM made his speech, he mentioned how each one of us can help create awareness about Janata Curfew. This is us doing our bit.”

She said ever since she put up a photo asking people to be cautious and practice social distancing, she received multiple requests from residents in her community wanting to participate in the challenge. The challenge is easy: Just post a photo of yourself with a placard “Ghar Pe Ich Baitho Na”, a fun Hyderabadi twist to what is being said all over the world — “Please Stay Indoors”.

Till now 35 people have participated in the challenge that began on Friday. “We in India have ‘sab chalta hai’ (everything will go on) attitude. This must change. I see people behave as if they are on a summer vacation. They continue to organise birthday parties and events. I wanted to be part of this challenge to let them know that the current situation is a serious one,” said Nandita Bhardwaj, a CA and mother.

Stressing on how important it is to “flatten the curve”, Richa Mundhra, an analyst with Google, said: “Symptoms can show up till 14 days. If people can stay at home during this period, it will make a huge difference. Those who are working, the ‘work from home’ option is a welcome relief.”

Among those who accepted the challenge was Priyanka Mallik, a resident of Lingampally. Mallik tried to catch people’s attention by turning to music. In a video uploaded on Instagram, she raps: “Listen up world, what we gotta say/We can fight together, there is a way/It’s not for you, it’s not for me/But home is where you gotta be.”

Cautioning again panicking, she says, “Don’t hoard stuff and don’t hoard cash/Don’t attend your bff’s bday bash/No sleepovers, no pyjama parties now/No salon visits, not the time for brow/Stay safe and stay back at home/Now is not the time to roam.”

Anticipating uncertain times, all vegetable markets in the city witnessed a huge turnout of customers on Saturday as they made bulk purchases. The increase in the crowd also saw vegetable prices rising by at least 30%.

Central vegetable market, Paravai market, farmers market at Anna Nagar and Bibikulam, K Pudur market, Thayir market as well as roadside markets on Bypass Road witnessed a sudden throng of men and women. Most of them purchased vegetables to stock up to 15 days instead of their usual one week. “Janata curfew has been called on Sunday. But we do not know what lies ahead and if it all it is a pandemic, how long will it last. What if markets are also shut like parks and large commercial establishments. I have purchased double the quantity of vegetables than my usual weekly quota,” said K Vijayalakshmi from Surya Nagar .

J Velavan from Ponmeni said there is panic among the public because of rumours that markets too will be closed as a preventive measure. With the public transport system also curtailed, the price of vegetables may increase further, he said. “The increased demand for vegetables has resulted in price rise. It is only 9 am, but more than half of the vegetables I purchased today has been sold out. Though it is only a one-day voluntary curfew, panic among the public is quite evident through the way they purchase,” R Selvam, a vegetable seller said.

Prices of all vegetables including onion, tomato, carrot, beans, coconut, brinjal, ladies finger and cabbage have gone up. While already they have witnessed an increase of up to 30%, it may rise further depending on how people react to the situation, he added.

Many residents said they have already purchased essentials required for the next one month from grocery stores and medical stores. It has resulted in the increased crowd in grocery stores, be it at the ones next door or wholesale grocery stores.

The cheats had promised to supply 1.35 lakh masks for Rs 19,84,000 and took an advance of Rs 1.56 lakh, after which they stopped communicating with the victim.

Chandlodia resident Abhishek Jain, 31, the complainant who works in a hospital in Sola, stated in his FIR at Sola police station on Friday that on February 23, while browsing Facebook, he came upon an advertisement for sale of masks put up by one Gautam Patel.

Jain then called up Patel’s Facebook manager, said inspector J P Jadeja of Sola police station. The manager said the masks were available and sent images of the masks to Jain’s phone. Initially, Jain turned down Patel’s manager’s demand for a token payment in advance. The next day, the manager again called up Jain and convinced him to pay the advance and complete the deal. He sent the bank details of his company, Nvalkaran Health Care Private Ltd, and the photo of the Aadhaar card of one Makrubia Gautam Patel of Surat.

On realizing that he had been cheated he approached police,” Jadeja said.

Jadeja added that they suspect a company located in Rajkot and a team is verifying the account.

The lack of modern communication methods and poor cell phone network in remote villages has forced officials to turn to the time-tested communication method with the local populace. “The problem is with cell phone network. We do not have connectivity in much of the agency and the only way to make public announcements is through tom-toms. This is a very effective method of communicating with the people and educating them on the new threat,” ITDA-PO DK Balaji said. Sources in ITDA added that instructions have been given to volunteers to spread the message among people in the agency. However, officials claim that raising awareness is becoming an issue in the agency, where people are not acquainted with sanitisers or hand washes, considering the fact that in many households even running water is not available.

“One of our key instructions to volunteers is to alert authorities in-case outsiders come to a particular village and reside with friends or relatives,” Balaji said.

They have returned home but have been advised home isolation.

There was much drama at the high rise for the last two days over one of the returnees, who is studying in the UK, being unwilling to isolate herself. Residents complained that she was also driving in and out of the complex at will, despite repeated requests from them. The other returnee, who has come from San Francisco after visiting her son, had initially not put herself in self-isolation but had done so when residents requested her.

When they couldn’t convince the women, the residents first complained to the Ballygunge police station. “When we found that this kept the girl home but her maid was all over the complex, we had no choice but to take our plea to the chief minister,” said a resident. The two returnees and the mother of the young girl were first taken to the Beliaghata ID for tests but they came back home. Later, they were taken back again to the quarantine centre at CNCI’s new complex at New Town where they were kept for the night.

“They returned this morning. Police assured us that they have tested negative but have been made to sign a bond where they have assured the administration that they will remain indoors for the next 15 days,” a resident said. The residents’ committee has decided to keep a vigil on them.

KMC will then put to use its available health infrastructure (malaria clinics) and its pool of doctors to screen patients from these areas and refer a few, if necessary, to government hospitals for tests. “The primary screening is necessary. Otherwise, people will crowd Beliaghata ID Hospital for with common flu symptoms,” a KMC doctor said.The survey will also help the state take into consideration the lockdown plan in case of an emergency. “Lockdown is a possibility but it will have a wider impact and the state and the health department will have to be prepared to meet the possible consequences. We will have to ensure the basic amenities to people because their movement will be restricted. So lot of administrative works need to be done before this is implemented,” the official said, adding that the government will explore the option only after more than 10% of citizens in a particular area gets affected.According to health officials, Bengal has just entered the second week and it will take a couple of weeks more to assess the extent of the virus spread. “So far, all but one detected with coronavirus came from outside.

321,['22/03/2020'],10k throng Guntur market yard as officials throw caution to winds,"Guntur: Farmers are thronging the agriculture market yard in Guntur with huge stocks of chilli . The market yard has been flooded with over 1.5 lakh bags each day for the past few days. Farmers are believed to be rushing to sell their stocks for fear of the state government regulating the transactions as part of measures to contain the spread of covid-19 virus in the coming days. The rush of stocks has dipped the price by Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,500 per quintal on Friday.

However, market committee officials took no steps to follow protocol set by the state government. The market committee neither kept sanitisers and face masks ready nor made merchants follow guidelines.

The market yard is heavily crowded with the massive arrival of stock as nearly 4,000 to 5,000 farmers are coming from different parts of Telugu states including Khammam, Nalgonda (Telangana), Krishna, Kurnool, Anantapur, Prakasam and Nellore districts besides the local farmers.

The market yard is witnessing near stampede like environment due to the presence of huge number of farmers.

In addition to the farmers, about 2,000 hamalis (daily wagers) and another 1,000-1,500 workers are also spending almost 20 hours in the market yard. About 400-500 traders and market committee staff were also working over-time in the yard keeping in view the peak season arrivals. This is making the market yard premises heavily crowded with over 8,000-10,000 people moving in very close proximity.

According to information, about 400-500 chilli exporters from different states including Maharashtra, West Bengal, New Delhi, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh are visiting the market yard to supervise the purchases.

Although, farmers coming from rural areas might not be carriers of the virus, travelling in buses and trains might put them in danger, said a trader in the market yard. Similarly, the presence of exporters from other states is creating fears in the yard as they might just leave everyone in trouble, he noted. In fact, marketing commissioner PS Pradyumna had directed the market yard officials to follow all covid-19 protocols to prevent the spread of virus. He asked officials to keep the sanitisers ready for the staff and make the commission agents supply sufficient number of masks and sanitisers to the weighmen, hamalis, farmers and their staff. Surprisingly, the officials have not followed even a single instruction issued by the commissioner as well as the district collector.

“We have asked the merchants to provide masks, hand sanitisers and napkins to the farmers and staff,” said market committee secretary M Venkateswara Reddy. However, the market committee had not initiated measures to check whether anyone is following the instructions. In fact, district collector Samuel Anand Kumar had issued detailed guidelines on crowd management in market places to contain the spread of viruses.

Commission merchants Association secretary Suresh Reddy alleged that the market yard secretary is least bothered about the situation and not taking any inputs from the traders. Meanwhile, the average prices have come down to Rs 8,000-Rs 10,000 per quintal from the previous Rs 10,000-Rs 12,000 per quintal.

KOLHAPUR: The markets in the city witnessed a large number of people buying essential goods ahead of the ‘janata curfew’ on Sunday.

There were queues in shops, since early in the morning till late evening though the district administration said the essential supply will be available. Due to panic purchase, essentials like milk was in short supply on Saturday afternoon. People also thronged meat markets.

One customer said: “We eat mutton or fish every Sunday so we decided to stock up incase shops remain shut. Also, the mutton sellers said they are unsure of opening their shops on Monday as well.”

Apart from the essential supply shops, everything else was shut in malls. At one of the malls in Tarabai Park, only 20 people were allowed at a time and the next batch of 20 was allowed after 10 minutes of the previous batch coming out.

The mall operators ensured that only one person from a family is allowed to enter at a time. This was done to ensure that people does not hoard the essentials.

Requests were made to the buyers not to buy in excess.

The railway stations and the central bus stand saw a surge in the number of people travelling back to their home town. Many of them depend on the hotels and the roadside eateries which too will remain shut on Sunday.

Hyderabad: A day before Janata Curfew, denizens were seen queueing up at retail shops to stock up on food supplies, bottled water, medicines, and other household necessities. A number of malls and shops in the city will remain closed on Sunday.

“Products such as rice, atta, pulses, edible oil, sugar, instant noodles, butter, frozen food, soaps, handwashes, and floor cleaners are now difficult to get at malls and supermarkets with most shelves empty,” said Saira Ahmed, a resident of Begumpet.

Unwilling to go out for grocery shopping amid coronavirus scare, many are opting to order products online. There is an increased demand for items such as frozen foods, ready to eat packets, milk products, and beverages and so most of the products are already out of stock.

“As much as it is convenient to get grocery products right in front of our door in a time like this, most of the delivery slots provided to us are delayed. We are getting our order two-three days later which isn’t helpful given most of us are in self-isolation,” Salva Rai, a resident of Somajiguda, told TOI.

Most in-demand items like handwash, soaps, and sanitisers have been off shelves for a long time now, while kitchen supplies like onions, potatoes, rice, and wheat, are stocked out across platforms, say customers.

“The fact that shops are going to be closed for a day should not alarm people as most of them have already bought food items that should last them till the end of the month. Hoarding products is not the solution as many who are in need might not even get to buy them,” said a customer at a local kirana store.

Meanwhile, people were seen going around in many localities in the city asking the residents not to venture out on Sunday.

AHMEDABAD: Amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, Gujarati singers are trying to cash in on the Covid-19 virus to go viral, and also spread awareness against at the local level.

A song by Gujarati singer Hitesh Rawal ‘Chothi aayo corona’ deals with the pandemic. It goes: ‘Corona no virus chothi aayo aaje, loko ne kashu na hamjashe, cheti ne rehjo virus valgi jashe. Virus ni charcha charekor aaje, Virus valgi jashe’. (Where did the corona virus come from, people won’t understand anything. They should remain alert or the virus will catch them. The virus has become the talk of the town, stay alert or it will catch you.)

Another song on Covid-19, by folk artist and singer Kiran Patel, ‘Corona thi chetore’ talks about how the virus spread and about social distancing. The lyrics say, ‘Cheen na malak thi farto aayo corona. Timli tane kahu chhe corona thi chetore, hello hi bolo re hath na milavo re. Door-door thi bhaibandho ne namaste bolo re’. (The virus has come all the way from China. I am telling you to be alert about corona. Just say hello-hi, don’t shake hands. Say namaste to your friends from a distance.)

Mehsana-based singer Divya Chaudhari’s new release “Karo namaste Corona ena raste” deals with the awareness aspect. The lyrics says, ‘Hath jodine karo namaste, corona virus halyo jashe ena raste’. (Say namaste with palms together and the virus corona will be on its way.)

About her song, Chaudhari says her stage performances were cancelled due to the pandemic so she thought about reaching out to people during the crisis by releasing a Gujarati song on the virus itself.

“I have been in the Gujarati music industry for two decades and this is the first time I’ve sung a song to make people aware of a disease. I wanted to convey my concern in an entertaining way, so people develop certain habits to prevent the virus spreading in Gujarat,” said Chaudhari.

Another singer, Kiran Patel, says his friends advised him to compose a song to raise awareness which can also be used by youths in their TikTok videos.

“For the last few days, people are talking about the coronavirus. Many of my friends used to talk only about this and they advised me to produce a song. I composed this song using a tribal tune from Panchmahal in such a way that youths can make TikTok videos using it and it will go viral and spread awareness about the coronavirus,” said Patel.

A Gujarati film producer, Narendrasinh Bapu, said some artists have also made a proposal to the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) authorities offering help in making an audio and video awareness campaign. “As the coronavirus spreads like a wild fire, Gujarati musicians and even folk singers such as Kirtidan Gadhvi are making their best efforts to make people aware of it,” said Bapu.

In the city, around 25,000 persons have been screened for Covid-19 symptoms. The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) has found one person with a travel history and he has been put in the quarantine ward.

District collector Daulat Desai has ordered the health staff to keep a watch on the other home-quarantined people. The officials have been asked to visit them thrice every day for follow-ups. Moreover, people completing the home quarantine period must be referred to the CPR Hospital for a final check-up before they are given the go-ahead to move around freely.

“To stop coronavirus transmission, home quarantine has been made compulsory. Those violating the rules will have to face police charges. The health authorities have been asked to forcefully take them into custody and keep them in the quarantine wards,” said Desai.

He added that violators will be charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and Communicable Disease Control Act.

So far, the district has had 523 people with symptoms akin to coronavirus infection. Of them, the authorities have identified 495 people who have come to India from abroad. Currently, 384 persons are under home quarantine. There are at least 24 local residents, who do not have any foreign travel history, in home quarantine. No confirmed coronavirus case has been reported in the district yet. The number of swab samples sent for the testing at the Pune-based NIV has increased to 12, which, according to the health officials, is much lower than the number of persons with symptoms.

The number of people completing the 14-day home quarantine period is 138. Collector Desai said these persons have to report the district health authorities time and again for their health check-up. Each such person is given a card stating the suggestions by the doctors.

Satej Patil, district guardian minister, said: “Checkpoints have been set up at several locations. We are tracing the persons coming from abroad. They will be compulsorily brought to the quarantine centres. Those who have come from cities like Pune and Mumbai, will be asked to quarantine themselves.”

The action has been taken as both of them were absent for six consecutive council meeting without any notice.

Ichalkaranji chief executive officer Deepak Patil had sent the proposal a few days back to disqualify Telnade brothers. Desai approved the proposal. However, Telnade brothers have been given period of 15 days to appeal before the state government.

Telnade brothers are wanted under under Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act (MCOCA) and are absconding for the past few months. The MCOCA court in Pune had set the deadline of March 16 for them to surrender before the court but they did not appear. Police are expected to initiate procedure to confiscate all the properties of Telnade brothers as per provisions of MCOCA.

The general body of Ichalkaranji municipal council was expected to pass a resolution on disqualifying Telnade brothers the last month. However, the general body did not take any decision, forcing the administration to send the proposal to disqualify them to the district collector. Sanjay Telnade was elected unopposed.

Telnade brothers are absconding since May last year after police raided a gambling den, being run by them. Police have arrested several of their accomplices, including a lawyer, but both of them continue to give a slip. Police have invoked MCOCA against Telnade gang.

Police have passed all information to Income Tax department and Directorate of Economics to initiate further action. Sanjay Telnade has 17 offences registered against him and his brother Sunil has seven offences registered against him.

The same was brought to the notice of the Chief Justice and senior judges all of whom agreed to take up the matter as a PIL asking the authorities concerned as to why two to three international passengers are being housed in one room.

Passengers arriving at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) from foreign countries are sent to the designated quarantine facilities. However, the rooms lack even the basic amenities. There is not enough water supply in the washrooms and so all efforts to maintain cleanliness goes in vain.

“While the state’s objective of assessing the health of all international air passengers, the place they chose for isolation wards is not fit for the purpose,” said the PIL, which made the state’s top medical and revenue authorities as respondents.

Unfortunately, these days, there are only posts about precautions to be taken against Covid-19 , he said.As the summer season peaks in Kerala, it is hectic time for drummers and Theyyam artists as two of the state’s popular obsession Melam and Theyyam begin again.

PUNE: The Kondhwa police booked a couple on Friday for duping a businessman from Raigad of Rs4 lakh in 2018 on the pretext of selling him a used earth-moving machine.

Businessman Ajay Rajaram Sapkal (43) has lodged an FIR of criminal breach of trust and cheating under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.

Sapkal came across an advertisement on an e-commerce website that mentioned that an earth-moving machine had been put up for sale posted by the couple. He wanted to buy it for farming and conducting his construction business.

Senior inspector Vinayak Gaikwad from the Kondhwa police said, “Sapkal contacted the couple and expressed interest in buying the machine. On August 18, 2018, Sapkal visited their office in a society building on the Katraj-Kondhwa bypass and the couple shown the machine.”

Gaikwad said, “Sapkal liked the machine and struck a deal with the suspects for buying it for Rs15 lakh. He paid a token amount of Rs50,000 in cash and Rs3.5 lakh by cheque to the couple on September 18, 2018. Sapkal assured the suspects that he would take a loan of Rs11 lakh to buy the machine.”

Sub-inspector Nilesh Chavan from the Khadi Machine Chowkey under the Kondhwa police said, “The couple contacted Sapkal on numerous occasions and asked him to pay the balance amount but he asked for the delivery before he made the payment.”

He said, “The couple failed to deliver the machine and gave vague replies whenever Sapkal tried to contact them. Eventually Sapkal realized that he had been cheated and asked the suspects to return Rs4 lakh to him but in vain.”

On December 18, 2019, Sapkal filed a complaint application with the office of deputy commissioner of police, Zone V.

Later the application was transferred to the Kondhwa police and a preliminary inquiry was conducted before a complaint was registered against the suspects, Chavan added.

343,['22/03/2020'],The internet is critical to navigating this pandemic,"We are at a critical point in history. The entire world is being affected by the novel coronavirus COVID-19. Leaders from all walks of life are being tested, as we face an unprecedented situation. From governments to businesses, from societies to families, this pandemic is causing a shift in our way of life – a paradigm shift that puts us all in uncharted territory. The best way to tackle this problem is to ensure that we practice social distancing and good personal hygiene, to ensure that we minimise the chances of community transmission. This implies taking potentially aggressive measures to reduce footfall in places of congregation.

A few decades ago, shuttering shops in this manner would spell disaster for businesses. Today, however, digital business models, the cloud, and new-age technology minimise the erstwhile disruption with the help of high-speed internet. Globally, and especially in India today, broadband is a critical part of the infrastructure needed to realise seamless delivery of essential services. High-speed internet is the prerequisite for uninterrupted life and business today.

Even now, as individuals and families quarantine themselves in their homes, people are already turning to the internet to access not just business solutions to help them outlast the pandemic but to seek solace, entertainment and information on the state of the world. Suddenly, people are trying to establish, “What is essential?” In fact, the interest in the search term, “essential commodities” on Google, has more than doubled in the past three weeks. High-speed internet is needed simply for people to know what is essential and what is not in the coming weeks. People’s social media accounts are starting to turn into mini news outlets while their couch and their laptop become their home office.

For businesses, digitally enabled online operations in the areas of sales, communication, and fulfilment can reduce the impact in today’s disruptive “COVID times”. High-speed data connectivity provides a virtual office-like working environment to all businesses without compromising on safety. As the market shifts, the speed with which businesses act is of the essence. One cannot afford to lose clients due to slow service and other technicalities. A high speed fiber broadband connection ensures that nothing about a business suffers due to the lack of speed or infrastructure, be it while you are having video conferences with the rest of the team or while you are providing services to your clients.

In a crisis, humans have looked to society and their contacts for support. Suddenly, people are being separated from their families, friends, neighbours and social circles as entire cities are entering quarantine. When students and workers are stranded in their college dormitories or in airports abroad, trying to come home or quarantined abroad, being able to pick up a phone and video call them over the internet offers support virtually where distance is an insurmountable factor.

In time, restricted movements, social distancing and the same walls around us, doing the same time, perhaps at home alone, may lead to boredom. To stave off boredom, we turn to the world that the internet offers us. When speed is not restricting someone, the possibilities are endless. It becomes very easy to just pick up that show you’ve been meaning to catch up on and binge it in HD. We may not be able to visit movie theatres, but can stream movies and tv shows that ensures that we have a near endless library of entertainment at hand. Between streaming and gaming, there is enough to keep many people occupied for a long time. If there is a language that you have wanted to learn for a while, now is the time. If you haven’t played the guitar for a while, YouTube lessons are but a click away. There’s a unique opportunity to spend time with and connect with your loved ones. Even if you just run out of groceries, or just want to order take out, you do not need to brave the pandemic and go out, when you can just order things over the internet. Social distancing and working from home have given rise to new ways of working including emergence of concepts like telemedicine and online virtual classes.

I believe that we will emerge from COVID-19 stronger, more united, and wiser. An connected society, thanks to the internet, provides the fulcrum to the combined strength of humanity, for the country’s machinery to continue running in the face of unprecedented headwinds. We have better information, swifter access to emergency services, quality availability of entertainment, instant connectivity to family and friends, uninterrupted and innovative education practices, and access to business solutions and more.

Decades from now, this time will be looked upon as a critical juncture in human history. This will be a trying time, but we will emerge better for it, and it wouldn’t happen if we weren’t as connected as we are today. High-speed internet connectivity has brought us all together, and it will be critical to braving the storm we are in today.

344,['22/03/2020'],"In 4 weeks, faux lungs turn grey in less polluted area","Nagpur: Corroborating air pollution in the city, the faux lungs installed outside KRIMS Hospital on Central Bazaar Road, Ramdaspeth, have changed colour — from pristine white to grey in a span of nearly four weeks. This, despite the area being one of the least polluted ones in the city and the frequent weather changes, including several spells of rain, in the last one month.

Mimicking actual functioning of human lungs, these artificial lungs also capture pollutants, which leads to change in its colour. Called ‘The billboard that breathes’, the lungs are fitted with HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filters. A pair of fans fitted at the back of the billboard sucks in air to mimic the functioning of lungs while breathing.

In the city, the lungs have been installed under a joint initiative by Jhatkaa.org, Waatavaran, Centre For Sustainable Development (CFSD) and KRIMS Hospitals.

In the second phase of the initiative, the organizations plan to install a couple of artificial lungs at highly polluted places, including traffic junctions. “Ramdaspeth is not one of the most polluted areas in the city. In the first phase, our priority was to sensitize citizens on air pollution. We will now focus on more polluted areas in the next phase,” said Leena Buddhe, founder of CFSD.

Similar lungs installed in Mumbai in January this year turned black in just two weeks. The lungs installed in New Delhi in November last year turned black in just six days while it took 25 days for the ones put up in Bengaluru to change colour.

Activists stressed that just because the faux lungs have not completely turned black yet, doesn’t mean Nagpur is not polluted. “The air quality index being displayed is still way above permissible limits. All cities have areas that are more polluted than others, and weather conditions play a huge role in how quickly the lungs change colour — especially in Nagpur where the installation is at a relatively low pollution spot,” said Shikha Kumar, campaigns manager at Jhatkaa.org.

She added that the several cloudy and windy days along with intermittent rains in the city also played an important role in further delaying the lungs from turning black.

Pulmonologist from KRIMS Hospital, Dr Sameer Arbat, said, “Ramdaspeth is a residential-cum-commercial area that has been regularly showing an AQI above 130. We need to understand that pollution is not limited to industrial areas and need not wait for the faux lungs to turn black to understand the impact of air pollution.”

Bhagwan Kesbhat, founder of Waatavaran Foundation, stated that it was for everyone to see that the HEPAfilter lungs have become dark in four weeks in one of the lesser polluted areas despite unseasonal rain last month. “This is enough indication that Nagpur needs a strong Clean Air Action Plan and citizens need to demand their right to clean air for themselves and the future generation,” he said.

RAJKOT: A 35-year-old Jamnagar man, who had returned recently from Dubai, gave the local health officials and police a tough time before he was quarantined on Saturday. Police have begun criminal proceeding against him and will be filing FIR against him for violation of government order.

According to JMC officials, Hala had returned from Dubai on March 10 and landed in Ahmedabad, where he stayed for a week. As soon as Hala arrived in Jamnagar on March 17, a team from district administration contacted him took him to quarantine centre set up in the city. But Hala gave them a slip and ran away.

348,['22/03/2020'],Albert Camus and the time of the infodemic,"BENGALURU: As we begin the day to observe Janata Curfew, we continue to be swamped by news and messages about Covid-19. It’s still coming to us, wave after wave, through every channel – comments and notes about the possible origin of the virus , Do’s and Don’ts, country-wise data, the benefits of “regulating” our daily routine, of social distancing, hand-washing and so on. Some useful, some useless and the rest, needless. But we carry on regardless, lapping up everything because after all, very few know enough.

All of which prompted WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to say, “We’re not just fighting an epidemic; we’re fighting an infodemic.” The organisation’s communication team hunkered down to bust myths: spraying alcohol or chlorine over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered; taking a hot bath does not prevent the disease; ultraviolent lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or that cold weather can’t kill the virus.

News portals have been putting together pandemic reading lists for those who are “stuck at home” and want to pore over apocalyptic fiction and non-fiction. Among the choices are Daniel Defoe’s “A Journal of the Plague Year”, Emily St John Mandel’s “Station Eleven”, Stephen King’s “The Stand”, Ling Ma’s “Severance” and topping them all, Albert Camus’s 1947 masterpiece “The Plague”, whose sales have spiked in recent weeks. Camus’s deeply-philosophical novel set in the plague-hit Algerian town of Oran, looks at human responses to calamities; how death and suffering come unannounced and render everything meaningless. It is this vulnerability that makes life absurd. At the centre of this fight against the epidemic are two strong characters representing duty and faith – Dr Bernard Rieuxo, a physician who’s an atheist, and Father Paneloux, priest and scholar.

But let’s stick to how the novel sees media handling this contagion. Parisian journalist Raymond Rambert meets Dr Rieux in his clinic one afternoon to get details for a story he’s doing on the sanitary conditions of the Arab population. The physician tells him he would share details only if he’s prepared to write an “unqualified condemnation of the present state of things”. Rambert gives up the idea and prepares to leave. Seeing him off, Rieux suggests another development that could make a curious story: the number of dead rats found all over town. At first, there’s disbelief or indifference in the town, but the mood changes.

As days pass, the local newspaper begins to devote its pages exclusively to a campaign against the authorities. Things get worse and the epidemic enters another phase. The radio stops announcing the weekly toll and switches to daily death stats, which the narrator feels lessens the gravity of the crisis. Even amidst paper scarcity that has forced the dailies to cut the number of pages, a new newspaper called “The Plague Chronicle” is launched to inform the townspeople “with scrupulous veracity, of the daily progress or recession of the disease”. For all its noble intentions, the Chronicle ends up devoting space to advertisements about “infallible” antidotes to the disease and the queues outside shops selling these.

Some of these insights came from the intense research Camus did on epidemics down the ages. But even a casual look at reportage in India in 1899 shows an almost gazette-style recording of statistics: “The following is the plague statement for the week ending January 13: Bangalore city – 8 attacks and 13 deaths; Bangalore Cantonment – 84 attacks and 58 deaths; Mysore city – 104 attacks and 79 deaths; Kolar district – 185 attacks and 114 deaths…” About three decades later, reports spoke of health authorities adopting new measures to prevent the spread of plague. They organised a “Rat Week” in 1932 to check the rodent population which included a rat-catching competition, film shows and awareness parades by school children.

Another character in Camus’s novel who is also grappling with communication – or rather, expression – is the kind-hearted Joseph Grand who wants to be an author and spends his time rewriting the opening sentence of his book – sometimes whole weeks on a “mere conjunction”. He once catches hold of Dr Rieux to say: “I grant you, it’s easy enough to choose between a ‘but’ and an ‘and.’ It’s a bit more difficult to decide between ‘and’ and ‘then.’ But definitely the hardest thing may be to know whether one should put an ‘and’ or leave it out.” As absurd as the café in the town which decides to boost its sales with the sign: “The best protection against infection is a bottle of good wine.” Did we hear something similar recently?

At the very end, Camus does allude to the cyclical turn in history. The plague bacillus, he says, “never dies or disappears for good”. The day would come “when it would rouse up its rats again and send them forth to die in a happy city.”

349,['22/03/2020'],Senior citizen held in Pune for outraging modesty of two women,"Representative image

PUNE: The Kothrud police on Friday arrested a farmer under the charge of outraging the modesty of a woman and her sister.

The police have invoked provisions of the Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhumane, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act and Section 354 of IPC.

The complainant (45) runs private coaching classes, while her sister is a medical practitioner. There was a drop in the number of students attending her coaching classes.

In January this year, the sister’s domestic help told the complainant about the suspect — Bharat Ganapati Kemdarane (70) of Osmanabad — whom she claimed practised exorcism. The complainant then contacted Kemdarane.

On February 11, Kemdarane arrived in Pune and went to the complainant’s house. He suggested a nightlong ritual to solve her issues, senior inspector Pratibha Joshi said.

He asked the two sisters to disrobe and used a lemon to perform a “ritual”, Joshi said. He then charged them Rs 7,000. The two women were uncomfortable and suspected that Kemdarane took advantage of them. After mulling this over for a month, the complainant approached the police, who arrested the suspect from Paranda.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

According to railway sources, the passengers panicked and pulled the chain multiple times. They asked the railway authorities to deboard the passenger with the stamp and sanitize the entire 22-coach train.

The passenger had landed at New Delhi’s IGI airport from Muscat (Oman), where he was stamped for ‘home quarantine’. He boarded the train from New Delhi railway station.

“He had boarded a sleeper coach of the train and later walked into the AC coach. Some passenger noticed a stamp on his hand and tweeted about this to @RailwaySeva. As soon we received the information, we traced the passenger. He looked scared, possibly due to other passenger’s aggressive stance of deboarding him. He had attempted to hide himself in the coach lavatory and also tried to erase the stamp. After help from the GRP squad, we calmed him down and then alighted him at Etawah junction,” said a railway source.

At 9:58 pm, Shiv Ganga Express was brought to an unscheduled halt at Etawah junction. At 10:02 pm, the passenger was taken off the train and sent to Etawah district hospital. Six coaches, including the pantry car, of the train were sanitised.

Multiple sources claimed that the passenger was humiliated by his fellow travellers. He was made to stand in a corner in the train as well as at the Etawah junction, until the medical team arrived.

Etawah CMO Dr Naresh Singh Tomar said, “The passenger was in deep distress. He was thirsty and hungry when he was brought to the hospital. After a thorough check-up, we found him normal.”

Dr Amarnath Tiwari, who inspected the passenger’s health, said, “Though he is normal, we have kept him in the isolation ward of the district hospital as a precautionary measure. After 72 hours, if shows any symptoms of Covid-19 infection, we will send his sample to KGMU.”

Earlier on Thursday night, Old Delhi-bound Kalindi Express was delayed for nearly an hour at Tundla junction after a woman passenger made distress call about a 64-year-old passenger, who had coughed in the AC1 coach while interacting with his relative over the phone. The passenger has returned from Dubai on February 29 and was heading back to Delhi for his medical check-up, as he was not screened at IGI airport when he landed.

Ajit Singh, chief public relations officer of North Central Railway, said, “The passenger was attended by a railway doctor who found him fit to continue his journey.”

According to railway sources, the senior citizen was secluded in a coupe on the demand of other passengers for the rest of the journey.

354,['22/03/2020'],"Three AMU students leave university’s isolation facility, traced to Kashmir","Aligarh Muslim University

AGRA: Three research scholars with a travel history to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) who left the isolation facility at the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) were traced by police to their homes in Jammu & Kashmir. They are now quarantined in Baramulla district hospital in the valley, AMU spokesperson Shafey Kidwai has confirmed.

The research scholars claimed that they had informed their research supervisors and taken a train home.

Officials at AMU health centre — where the trio were housed — initially claimed the trio had absconded on March 19. But chief medical officer of AMU’s health centre Dr Shariq Aquil confirmed to TOI that the confusion arose because students had informed their research supervisors that they were leaving but not the health centre.

One of the research scholars told TOI they had arrived in Aligarh on March 9 and had been in self-isolation for four days. He said that after VC Tariq Mansoor’s notice that those with travel history to foreign countries should report to the health centre, all three of them had gone for a check up and were sent back to the hostel since they didn’t have any symptoms.

On March 18, provost of the hostel visited their rooms and asked them to get admitted to the health centre. “We were admitted there but instead of isolation wards, we were kept together in cubicles in one large room and not even given masks. One more student who had returned from Taiwan joined us and he was coughing and sneezing which is why we got scared and asked for separate isolation wards,” said the student. He said they left for home since they were not shifted to another ward.

AMU spokesperson, however, said proper precautions were taken. “The isolation ward has five cubicles, each separated by a six-feet wall. All students were kept in separate cubicles,” he said.

355,['22/03/2020'],Agra to observe complete shutdown during ‘Janata Curfew”,"Agra: Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s clarion call to the nation to participate in the ‘Janata Curfew’ against Covid -19, all major business and market associations of Agra district have decided to observe a complete shutdown on Sunday.

Petrol pumps will remain closed from 7 am to 9 pm. Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) buses will not operate from 6 am to 10 pm. Agra- Mathura city bus services will also remain suspended. Major transporters have declared that their trucks will ply on Sunday.

On Saturday, shopping malls around the city remained close following the orders of the district magistrate. Shopkeepers downed their shutters early in the evening.

Agra Vyapar Mandal president TN Agarwal said, “Agra will be observing complete shutdown on Sunday. Except for pharmacies and other essential item shops, all businesses across the district will remain closed. It is the responsibility of every citizen to participate in the war against coronavirus.”

Heeren Agarwal, secretary of Sanjay Place Market Association, said, “We have asked all the members not to open their shops and showrooms on Sunday and avoid stepping out of the house if it is not necessary. It is the duty of each citizen to stop the virus from spreading and contribute in the efforts to so by the government.”

President of the Agra Shoe Factors Federation Gagandas Ramani said, “We welcome the Prime Minister’s call for Janata Curfew and will be observing complete shutdown on Sunday. Shoe factory owners have decided to keep operations suspended on Monday and Tuesday as well. We also should cooperate with the government in every possible way to check the spread of the the deadly virus.”

District president of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh Bhupendra Rana said, “The PM’s call for Janata Curfew is to benefit the entire nation. We have communicated the message to observe complete shutdown and social isolation on Sunday to our workers and members. Autorickshaws and e-rickshaw drivers’ leaders have been informed not to operate on Sunday.”

357,['22/03/2020'],Covid-19 pandemic: Pets bearing brunt of fake news forwards,"HYDERABAD: While coronavirus is spreading across the globe, fake news and misconceptions are spreading even faster. One such news is that of dogs and other domestic animals being carriers of this virus. In recent days, the state has seen a spike in abandonment of pets over such misconceptions. Animal activists said that in many cases, healthy dogs are being left on the streets by their owners.“I have been receiving 10 to 15 calls a day from people willing to give up their dogs. When I ask them why do they want to do so, some say they are scared they might get infected,” said Pravallika N, founder of Compassionate Society for Animals (CSA).Despite the World Health Organisation (WHO) denying rumours of dogs being carriers of the virus, many have been rushing to veterinary clinics to get their pets vaccinated. Veterinarians, at both private and government clinics, have been receiving an increasing number of calls for vaccination. “It is important to understand that coronavirus in dogs and novel coronavirus (Covid-19) are completely different. We are counselling people who are enquiring about the vaccine but still many insist on getting their pets vaccinated with the coronavirus injection,” said Dr M Nivedita who works for Blue Cross and also runs a private clinic.Coronavirus in dogs causes mild gastroenteritis along with diarrhoea and usually happens to older dogs while the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) is a respiratory disease which spreads only through human transmission. When asked about the crisis, GHMC chief veterinary officer Dr Abdul Vakil said: “It is illegal to abandon pets. We have already spread word among doctors and volunteers to explain and spread awareness about the fact that Covid-19 doesn’t spread from dogs and the coronavirus vaccine for dogs is optional.” He also added that strict action will be taken against those who abandon their pets.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74756137,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-401190,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pets-bearing-brunt-of-fake-news-forwards/articleshow/74753083.cms
358,['22/03/2020'],Shops selling non-essential items to be closed till Tuesday,"Kolkata: All shops selling non-essential commodities will be shut till Tuesday, Confederation of West Bengal Traders’ Association president Sushil Poddar said on Saturday. The association will review the situation on Tuesday evening and decide whether to open on Wednesday or extend the closure.

The announcement triggered panic buying across markets, leading to shortage of essential commodities. Though the traders’ body claimed that shops selling foodgrains, staples and groceries were exempt from the purview of closure, people rushed to the markets to buy rice, wheat, pulses and potatoes in bulk. The shutdown will include trading and retail hubs in Burrabazar and New Market. Grocery, medicine and milk booths will open for a few hours.

While some traders said the panic buying was a result of consumer speculation of a long-term shutdown following the PM’s call for ‘janata curfew’ on Sunday, many also blamed a section of wholesalers and mahajans for hiking prices to take advantage of the Covid-19 scare.

Enforcement agencies and market task forces swung into action and carried out raids at the markets in Posta, Koley, Maniktala, Jadu Babur Bazaar to dissuade traders from adopting any dishonest means to maximize profits. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has assured there will be no shortage of essential commodities in the state.

Panic purchase has been going on for three days now. Rice was the first staple commodity to fly off the shelves, followed by flour, edible oils and pulses. Potato, too , saw record sale in last few days.

Potato — which was selling at Rs13-14/kg on Thursday and Friday — cost Rs 25-30/kg on Saturday. In many markets, goods vehicles carrying potatoes reached late or did not reach at all — a typical ploy of hindering free flow of supply to jack up prices. “For the last three-four days, rumours were doing rounds that the government may go for long-term lockdown, necessitating the stocking of non-perishable essentials.

Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim also assured that there will be no shortage of commodities. Citizens must not indulge in panic buying that will only encourage hoarders. “We are keeping some municipal markets open so that people can still buy essentials even on Sunday. I appeal to citizens not to venture out of their homes except in case of emergency.”

Sri Krishna Bhandar, a retail shop in Khidderpore, exhausted its sizeable stock of rice and pulses in two hours on Friday. “On Saturday, when I tried to book an order to replenish my stock, I found prices of all essential commodities had gone up by nearly Rs30/kg. My customers will think that I am hiking the price taking an advantage of their distress,” owner Jatin Ghosh said.

359,['22/03/2020'],How Racing Came to Bengaluru,"BENGALURU: Somewhere on the border of what are now Austin Town and Domlur once stood an open plain. In the earlier half of the 19th century, this was once an animal fighting arena – where spectators watched battles with cheetahs, and between other big cats. According to historian BN Sundarrao, the author of Bengalurina Ithihasa (Bengaluru’s History), first published in 1983, describes the arena – complete with wooden galleries for the audience. Tigers and leopards that were captured from the wild were brought to the arena and grand events where men fought these wild beasts were arranged for the Bengaluru people. “Sundarrao records two incidents at the location when large crowds gathered to watch a group of British military men, named Lieutenant Audrey, Captain Sapper and Captain Cole fought tigers using spears and guns,” says Vemagal Somashekar, historian and author.

1857 changed everything for Bangalore. The first war of independence led to large scale deployment of British troops in the cantonment area. And with them came a passion for thoroughbreds and therefore, horseracing.

Ancient History

Horse racing has been around almost from the beginning, from when humans domesticated horses, in what is present day Kazakhstan, about 5,000 years ago. Chariot racing was part of the ancient Greek tradition of funeral games – sporting contests held to honour the recently deceased. They also became one of the biggest sports – and attractions – at the ancient Olympic games, when they were introduced in 680 BC.

These old racetracks were called hippodromes, dangerous tracks with hairpin turns at either end. In a tradition that continues to this day, the prizes and acclaim were given to the owners of the horse teams, not to the driver of the chariot or the horse’s jockey. A 2000-year-old tablet, part of the Lukuyanus monument in Turkey, contains details of the rules of racing at the time. Among the rules – a horse that won one race could not participate in other races, and its owner could not run a horse in any other race.

Horse races feature in Nordic myth as well. The Prose Edda by Snorri Sturluson describes a race between the god Odin and the giant Hrungnir, a race run because of Odin’s boast that his horse Sleipnir was faster than the giant’s steed Gullfaxi. Odin wins the close-fought race and invites the giant to Valhalla – setting of a chain of events that led to Hrungnir’s death.

British Institution

Horse racing as a professional sport in the UK can be traced back to the 12th Century after the English knights returned from the Crusades with Arab horses. These horses were bred with English horses to produce the thoroughbred horse. Later, during the reign of Charles II from 1660 to 1685 the king held horse races between two horses on private courses or open fields with prizes awarded to the winners and Newmarket was the venue for the first horse racing meetings in Britain. Racing as a spectator sport – with betting – took off in the early 1700s, and racecourses were built all over England. In 1750 horse racing’s elite met at Newmarket to form the Jockey Club to oversee and control English horse racing. The Jockey Club wrote a comprehensive set of rules for horse racing, and these rules were the basis of racing rules in their colonies – and therefore in India as well.

Colonial Heritage

The first racecourse in India was set up in Madras, back in 1777. From there, other turf clubs took hold. In Bangalore, the old animal fight arena was slowly converted to a racecourse.

Training for Courses

According to Captain Horace M Hayes, a British racing aficionado and expert on racing who lived in India in the nineteenth century, there were 74 racecourses in India in 1890. The Bangalore racecourse was a mile and two furlongs in length, and was one of the shorter courses in the country, but it made up for it by being on uneven ground. “I believe that the Bangalore Course, for one and a half miles, is six seconds slower than that of Madras,” Hayes wrote in his 1892 book, Training and Horse Management in India.

Not all races were run by the British, and they trained local men – preferably young teens to ride their horses, both during the training as well as the race. These boys were usually paid from Rs 6 to Rs 10 a month with a Rs 5 bonus every time their horse won. (An English jockey in India, on the other hand, was paid Rs 150 a month and Rs 100 for winning.

The New Club

This year, the Bangalore Turf Club celebrates its centenary. But racing in Bengaluru was much older than the club. The presence of the British soldiery in the city also saw the import of horses from the Middle East – most notably by Ali Asghar and others. The Mysore cavalry had rows of stables outside the city’s fort – in what is now Kalasipalayam. And as for Bengaluru’s original race course? The only remnant is in the name of a thoroughfare in Austin Town: Old Race Course Road.

The fire tragedy of 1970

On October 23, 1970, Bengaluru witnessed a fire tragedy when a horse stable on Palace Grounds went up in flames killing 35 animals. Allegedly set fire by some men, the incident drew much sympathy and anger among denizens then.

With the horse racing frenzy in its peak in the 70s, Bengaluru had a dedicated stable in Munireddy Palya (now JC Nagar) were the horses owned by various racing enthusiasts were kept. Over 50 people worked in the sheds which had a thatched roof and many horses including some famous ones were breed. According to old media reports and historian accounts, there was rift brewing between the workers in the sheds and the owners over money. It ended in a shockingly cruel twist, when some men allegedly set fire to the roof of the stables. 35 horses died. Media reports and images had half burnt bodies of the animals which had made a desperate attempt to escape the blaze.

A police investigation followed into the matter then and horse stables were permanently removed from the location.

360,['22/03/2020'],Electric bus depot will be developed at Etmadpur,"Agra: The state government, under the Agra smart city project, has approved a plan to develop an electric bus depot and charging center on 1.94 hectare land in village Madra under Etmadpur sub-division. Besides, the process to purchase 100 battery-run buses, proposed to be operated by the Agra-Mathura city transport service limited, has been initiated.

According to city transport service officials, the land acquisition process will be started in April.

Managing director of Agra-Mathura city transport service RBL Sharma said, “The plan to develop a modern electric bus depot and charging centre at village Madra has been approved by the state government. The 1.94 hectare land on which the depot will be developed belongs to the Agra development authority (ADA). Registration process of the land will be completed in the next month.”

He said, “Hundred electric buses are proposed to be operated in Agra and Mathura city. Currently, 170 CNG buses operate in Agra and 60 diesel buses operate in Mathura. Majority of these buses are old and require replacement. The state government has taken the decision to replace old CNG and diesel buses with modern electricity buses. The process to purchase these buses has been initiated.”

The state government has planned to operate 580 electric buses on contract basis in nine major cities. Out of these, 100 buses will be operated in two cities under the eco-sensitive Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ).

Besides Agra and Mathura, other cities where electric buses will be operated include Kanpur, Prayagraj, Ghaziabad, Varanasi, Gorakhpur and Saharanpur. The urban transport directorate has planned to start operation of at least 10 buses in each city within the next three months.

According to officials of the urban transport directorate, the electric buses will have a travelling range of 150km on single charge. The buses will have maximum speed of 75 kilometer per hour. The lithium-ion batteries of these buses will not take more than 30 minutes to charge completely.

361,['22/03/2020'],"Delhi: Buses at half strength, daily items available","The PM’s call has struck a chord with Delhiites, who have prepared for the daylong isolation.

NEW DELHI: For Shilpi Mukherjee, a 30-year-old Laxmi Nagar resident, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for ‘janata curfew’ on Sunday is not only a welcome initiative but also a breather. Mukherjee, who is employed in the development sector, hasn’t started working from home yet and now can’t decide how to spend this Sunday — by reading a book she bought last year or watching a new series.

“Self-isolation is extremely important because we don’t know when there could be a sudden spike in the number of Covid-19 cases. I would have preferred if the curfew was for four to five days,” she said. “Hopefully I would be able to work on alternate days from next week,” she added.

The PM’s call has struck a chord with Delhiites, who have prepared for the daylong isolation. Many have asked their domestic helps to take the day off and also cancelled visits to friends or relatives.

On Saturday, most people stocked up on food items such as bread, milk and vegetables, with the result that many shops had run out of milk by Saturday afternoon. “I don’t intend to get out of my house at all on Sunday and that’s why have thought of stocking up on some milk and noodles. However, local shops had run out of both by evening,” said Akash Sharma, a Malviya Nagar resident. “It is good move by the PM and I’m looking forward to showing my appreciation for those who are at the frontline of this battle at 5pm from my balcony.” Many people bought basic medicines, too.

“I plan to use the Sunday by starting to work on a novel that I have been planning for a long time. I will also spend time with my family,” said Prakash Kumar, of Ashok Vihar. “I’m missing my brother who is stranded in Australia,” he added.

“The move will prepare citizens for some kind of isolation and social distancing,” felt Pankaj Agarwal, general secretary of Delhi RWAs Joint Front. “Safdarjung Enclave, where I live, is already in ‘janata curfew’ mode and most shops are closed. At 5pm on Sunday, all residents of our block will come out and clap or clang utensils,” he said.

S R Sangar, general secretary of Federation of IP Extension II Housing Societies, said he had asked all RWAs of the area to cooperate with the initiative. “This will help instil discipline and stop the spread of the disease.”

B S Vohra, of East Delhi RWAs Joint Front, said it should have been a 15-day curfew. “Everyone is supportive of the initiative but I believe more awareness is needed for those who are not less educated.” In east Delhi, residents will come out at 5pm to express their support for the fight against novel coronavirus, he added.

S P Mudgal, general secretary of RWA of Maya Vihar in west Delhi, said even the temple in the area would be closed to make the move a success. “As the PM himself have requested people, everyone is prepared to do this,” he said.

363,['22/03/2020'],"Hosps shun OP visit, take telemedicine route","Kochi: The new coronavirus is about to reshape the manner in which doctors and patients interact in the state. With the majority of hospitals discouraging OP consultations for routine or existing ailments, many hospitals and even healthcare providers have taken to telemedicine services.

Patients can now reach out to doctors over the phone, email or WhatsApp for medical advice in some clinics and hospitals, while in others, hospital staff is now reaching the patient’s doorstep.

“It is really a difficult time. Even as hospitals get ready to treat Covid-19 patients, we can’t forget our patients with existing illnesses as well as those who need medical help,” said Indian Medical Association ( IMA ) state president Dr Abraham Varghese.

“Many small clinics in Kochi have now started telemedicine services. The doctor interacts with a patient either through video call or by mail and advice patients on medicines and tests. Consultation fees are paid online,” said Varghese. This, despite the fact that several doctors had stopped responding to messages or emails in the wake of increasing cases of medical negligence.

On the other hand, Sunrise Hospital has initiated home services, in which a team will visit patients and prescribe medicines or tests. The team will dispense medicine and collect blood samples for further tests, if any. This facility will initially be available only within Thrikkakara municipal limits.

Meanwhile, various medical associations have decided to set up helpline numbers to provide voluntary consultations. People can clear doubts about medication, symptoms and issues related to lung health. “If there is Covid-19 outbreak in the community, the most vulnerable are those with respiratory problems such as COPD and asthma. To help such patients, we pulmonologists will be available on call,” said Academy of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine president-elect Dr P S Shajahan.

Even IMA has asked for a list of doctors in each district who are willing to provide voluntary free consultation over the phone.

Double workload for lab staff

Dr Preeti’s* day starts with donning a hazmat suit before she enters the virology lab in Delhi’s AIIMS . It could be 12-14 hours before she can think of leaving. Since the beginning of March, lunch and dinner often merge into one, sleep is less than three hours as she and her colleagues examine petri dishes of nasal and measles swabs. About 192 samples are tested in 24 hours and the work requires extreme caution and accuracy. “As doctors we are used to working under pressure but this is different. The hazmat suit is suffocating and sweaty, and then there is a fear that engulfs you. The sample shouldn’t spill, it shouldn’t get contaminated, the results should be accurate….so much is at stake,” says the 29-year-old senior resident. Healthcare workers in government hospitals and labs have always dealt with less pay and heavy workloads but now there’s sweat (from the hazmat suits if they’re lucky to get one), fear (of getting infected, especially with a face mask shortage lurking), frustration (at not knowing how to stop the march of this virus).DOCTOR’S ADVICE: This image of Amarinder Singh Malhi, senior resident at AIIMS Delhi, holding a placard has gone viral, with even PM Modi retweeting it. But the 37-year-old is worried. “Only 10-20% are following the advice to self-isolate. We need to amplify the message a lot more,” he says.While others get more family time during quarantines, doctors are scared to touch, let alone hug their wives and kids. Dr D Himanshu Reddy, in charge of the infectious disease unit at Lucknow’s King George’s Medical University (KGMU), moved out of home and into the hospital guest house five days earlier. “I distanced myself as soon as the first positive case in Lucknow was reported. I have not seen my father and children for about 10 days,” he says. To add to the tension, a doctor in the hospital tested positive for Covid-19 earlier this week. Some stay at home, but with strict isolation protocols. “Just like patients in the isolation ward, we lead restricted lives at home,” says KGMU’s Dr Mohd Ansari, who got the entire first floor of his house converted into an isolation zone to quarantine himself after duty. He eats alone and washes his own clothes to protect his family.Like many of her colleagues, Dr Preeti has shifted into the AIIMS hostel, and speaks to her parents on the phone to allay their concerns. “I know that the phone can also be a source of contamination so I don’t use it in the lab. I try and catch up with them when I am off-duty,” she says in a tired voice.Despite the hard slog, doctors have to often deal with hostile patients who want to leave. “Quarantined people whose test results are yet to arrive make irrational demands. Some of them fight with us to let them go home. It is very frustrating,” says a doctor posted at Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital.For nurses, the job profile now includes monitoring patients in quarantine and even keeping guard. At the entrance to the isolation ward no 27 in BMC-run Kasturba Hospital sits an alert nurse, covered in a green protection suit and an N95 mask. Nothing misses her eye — or ears. “Don’t allow anyone to linger here,’’ she shouts at the guards while rushing out to shoo away people hanging around. “It is for your own good,’’ she tells the hangers-on. In times of Covid-19, it is perhaps the sanest piece of advice, but these women and men manning the wards of Mumbai’s only infectious diseases hospital can do anything but “stay home’’. Doctors working here say nurses (“You will find only senior, well-trained nurses in Kasturba Hospital,’’ said a senior doctor) are the main backbone of a hospital with a minimal workforce that comprises PG students on rotation from a nearby civic medical school.Like doctors, nurses too are tense. A nurse in Bengaluru’s Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases self-isolated for a whole month till she tested negative for Covid. “I went to meet my parents in my hometown only after the results,” he says.The four Covid-19 patients stuck in the isolation ward of the Medical College Hospital (MCH), Kottayam, often chat with the nursing staff who attend to them. However, the three male nurses who voluntarily opted to do this duty which many colleagues avoided, are not battling just a pandemic but also social stigma. Last week, their landlord told them to vacate the house they were renting since he feared infection. Though the trio, all in their early 30s, got temporary accommodation in the hospital, they doubt that anybody will give them a house. Indira P G, a nursing officer at MCH, says nursing staff needs more support. “Society should realise what the world would be like if no nurse wanted to work in such situations,” she said.In the last two months, laboratories too that have come under huge pressure. At the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Alappuzha, tests have seen a spike from 70-80 samples a day to 250 in March, forcing the team of 20 to stretch their working hours. What keeps them going? Officer-in-charge A P Sugunan (Scientist-G) says each negative result is a shot in the arm. Jijo Koshi, a lab technician, from Thiruvananthapuram, has been living away from home since the beginning of March. He says, “Though I want to see them, there is no time. I spend most of my day in the lab and manage with food from outside.”But still India’s healthcare staff goes on. “People at home say take leave and come for back after two months. But though it sounds dramatic I have told them that this is war, and I am a soldier and soldier’s families don’t talk like that,” says a 29-year-old senior resident at Safdarjung hospital.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74752160,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-186607,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/why-you-need-to-clap-for-indias-healthcare-workers/articleshow/74752009.cms

373,['22/03/2020'],His creative technology truly prevention better than cure,"It’s one of the oldest and often used adage — prevention is better than cure — and probably that’s why its importance is lost. But 28-year-old entrepreneur Shubhendra Singh Thakur has designed his entire life’s philosophy around it. Having conceptualized and made early detection kits for kidney disease and oral cancer, Thakur is hoping that ‘nipping it in the bud’ will help to stem the rot.

A B.Sc (biology) student, Thakur has always been fascinated with creating new gadgets which can help make people’s lives easier. He won an innovation award for start-ups in 2017 which was organized by Bootstrap track of FbStart, a Facebook platform. That award was for a college campus networking app.

Later, for safety of women, he developed a glove which gave an electric shock to the perpetrator.

But his shift towards medical devices started due to a personal reason. Thakur said, “In 2017, doctors said that my mother’s kidneys have shrunk. The options were a kidney transplant or to continue dialysis.”

He started researching on both options and for dialysis, he found that the mental trauma to the patient is more dangerous. “The patient already feels he’s a burden to others around him and lying in bed for hours during dialysis pushes him more into depression,” said Thakur.

The exceedingly long paperwork for kidney transplant, even if coming from a family member, and costs associated with it were beyond what a middle class family can manage. “I realized that had early detection happened, my mother’s kidneys would never have reached this stage. It’s then that I started working on the device that would help give out those signals early,” said Thakur, whose mother’s help is now slowly improving.

Around the same time, as Thakur’s trips to various hospitals increased, he came across patients of oral cancer. “Their level of pain is unbearable. Patients come there at a stage when cancer has taken control and operating is the only option. I decided that this is something which also needs to be detected early through simple home-based tests,” said Thakur.

By early 2019, he had completed both his liver disease and oral cancer detecting kits, which work in non-invasive way. “People just have to use either their urine or saliva samples. These devices basically tell you whether or not you are at risk of a kidney disease or oral cancer. This helps people take an early and informed decision about seeking professional medical help,” said Thakur.

He strongly believes that such early interventions will not only help save people’s lives, but also lessen the burden on the health care system.

On Friday, the Surat Diamond Association (SDA) had announced that the diamond markets in Varachha and Mahidhapura will be shut for two days starting Saturday, while the diamond manufacturing units were to remain shut only on Sunday.

Industry sources said that the world’s largest diamond bourse, Bharat Diamond Bourse (BDB) in Mumbai, has been shut down after the Maharashtra government declared lockdown in the four cities including Mumbai till March 31. However, the diamond trade has come to a standstill in Surat and Mumbai following the lockdown.

Chairman of Venus Jewels, Sevanti Shah told TOI, “All diamond unit owners have decided to keep units shut till March 31 following the state government appeal. The decision to further extend the closure will be taken after reviewing the COVID-19 situation after March 31.”

Shah further said that the export of polished diamonds and jewellery from Mumbai has been stopped completely following the shutting down of the BDB. Majority of the diamantaires from Surat having offices in Mumbai too have returned home, he added.

Nainesh Patchigar, director of Indian Bullion Jewellers Association (IBJA) said, “More than 3,500 jewellery shops and showrooms in Surat and south Gujarat will remain shut till March 24.”

Among the new cases, six were reported in Kasaragod and three each in Kannur and Ernakulam districts, Vijayan told reporters here.Applauding the support extended by various community and religious leaders for checking the spread of coronavirus, the CM, however, warned of strict action against the few who flouted the rules and continued to organise festivals and religious gatherings. “If advisories are flouted, the government would be forced to tighten security measures and invoke even prohibitory orders…. Those who break the declaration for home quarantine, signed at the time of leaving airports, would also have to face serious consequences. Such people not only risk their lives but pose threat to the lives of others'', he said.The CM said the government was exploring options to open Covid-19 testing facilities in private labs with required infrastructure facilities. Seventy Covid-19 suspects were admitted to hospitals on Saturday. With this, the number of persons under hospital quarantine has reached 228.

385,['22/03/2020'],Social distancing: When mom and dad don’t get it,"For many, the coronavirus outbreak has meant a lot of handwashing — and handwringing. With many senior folks either dismissing it as ‘just another flu’ or sticking with the ‘que sera sera (whatever will be will be) attitude, millennials are trying everything from chidings, emotional blackmail, hunger strikes and even some Twitter-shaming.

Journalist Ishaan Tharoor called his parliamentarian father a “lackadaisical boomer”. He tweeted: “@ShashiTharoor insists on going to Parliament with hordes of other people pressed together in close quarters even as Indian government enacts significant measures to begin imposing social distancing. This is nuts. It’s not only dangerous for him, but his whole household, including my elderly grandmother.”

Shashi Tharoor gamely tweeted that he had been put in a spot by his son.

Many millennials with stubborn parents or grandparents expressed frustration that neither threats, nor blackmail had worked. One tweeted about how she had tried to scare her parents to death, while another spoke about how her father, an avid WhatsApp user, was convinced that chicken soup would cure the disease. Venting on social media, frustrated millennials appeared to be at the end of their tether, some even wondering if they should continue living with them or keep them isolated.

One even mentioned how he was “cool” because his father had broken a leg making social distancing easy to implement. Syed Taahir from Karnataka gave up after his daylong hunger strike didn’t work. “My father continues to go out to pray during namaz and my mother has still not discontinued the domestic help’s services though she knows that she works at several homes and could potentially infect her,” he said.

Chennai-based civil services aspirant Priya Kathiravan managed to convince her 68-year-old father and 60-year-old mother to restrict their activities to some extent, but they refused to use masks or sanitisers. Their stubbornness has driven her up the wall. “They are going out to get daily provisions like milk or groceries. So, I asked them to at least use masks and sanitisers to protect themselves, but they just laughed off the suggestion,” she said. Priya is even more frustrated because she went to 10 or 15 medical shops before she managed to get the sanitisers.

Phone calls twice a day by Delhi-based Sameer (name changed) to his parents in Nagpur have not managed to curb their social life. They ignore him to attend relatives’ functions, socialise with their neighbours and go for walks he groaned. “Maybe we need a training course for the elderly,” he joked.

They are Jomon and his friend Rajendran of Kumily, who raped and murdered a woman and her daughter in Idukki; Anilkumar alias Kolusu Binu who killed a man and then raped his wife during a house burglary at Koliyoor in Thiruvananthapuram, leaving the woman in a vegtative state; and Thomas Chacko of Ranni who killed his nephews aged just seven and three in 2013.Prison authorities said that just because they were awarded the death sentence does not mean they will face the gallows as most of them may get their sentences commuted by higher courts. Antony, who had massacred six members of a family in Aluva in 2001, is a case in point. His death sentence was commuted by the Supreme Court.The last execution in the state was carried out on July 6, 1991, when Ripper Chandran, who was convicted in a serial murder case, was hanged in Kannur.

BENGALURU: Karnataka government is all set to take a leaf out of the Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government and provide direct cash transfer to daily wage and construction workers, whose livelihood has been hit by the Covid-19 crisis.

On Saturday, it was reported that Adityanath had announced direct cash transfer of Rs 1,000 for daily wage labourers. Following the report, the Karnataka labour department was asked to ascertain the level of assistance the government can provide to daily wage labourers here. Labour minister Shivram Hebbar is expected to discuss the issue with officials on Monday, and send a proposal to CM BS Yediyurappa.

Hebbar said, “If we do it, we need to do it in a manner which will provide parity to all labour groups. There are three categories — organised, unorganised and construction workers. While data is available on organised and construction workers, we do not have any numbers on the unorganised sector. However, we hope to offer some assistance by next week.”

Officials have been asked to gather details about similar schemes from UP and Maharashtra. Karnataka has a construction workers’ welfare board, which has an unused corpus of Rs 8,000 crore.

Only grocery shops, vegetable stores, fruit stores and medicine stores will be allowed to operate.

All industries including diamond, textile, chemical, powerloom weaving units have announced closure till March 24 and March 31, respectively, following the worsening situation of the COVID-19 in the city.

On Saturday, majority of the shops in the city’s oldest market, Chauta Bazaar, downed their shutters after the residents avoided visiting the market owing to Covid-19 panic in the city. Majority of the shops in the walled city areas including roadside eateries remained shut on Saturday.

Most of the city areas including Adajan, Pal, City Light, Parle Point Udhana, Athwalines looked deserted as commuters and pedestrians’ presence was very thin on the road after the news on the new positive cases spread thick and fast.

The civic body has barred entry of visitors at SMC headquarters and all the municipal zone offices in the city till March 29. The residents have been advised to make use of the online services and helpline number 18001238000 for registering their complaints and seeking the assistance from the zone offices.

MUMBAI: As the city slows to fight Covid-19, its air has seen a decline in pollutant levels, found a report by System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). According to SAFAR, there was a 45% drop in concentration of nitrogen oxide (NOx) this month compared to March 2018 and 2019. A drop in concentration of PM 2.5 too was seen since restrictions were imposed.

SAFAR’s report states, “Fossil fuel emission, mainly coming from vehicular traffic, is one of the major sources of NOx (60-80%) and PM2.5 (35-50%) in Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and Ahmedabad. Under fair weather conditions, NOx levels are mainly controlled by its major sources of emissions (vehicular traffic), although changes due to weather cannot be ruled out. Hence, if NOx levels are reduced significantly as compared to earlier years, it may provide us a qualitative/broader indication in reduction in emissions in major sources.” In Mumbai’s lowered Nox levels, the major drop of 75% was noticed at BKC. Nerul and Worli too showed a reduction. But levels at Colaba, Andheri, Malad and Mazgaon showed no change.

SAFAR has also recorded a drop in PM 2.5 levels, concentration of which is used to calculate air quality index. Though PM 2.5 concentration in comparison with March 2018 and 2019 did not show a change, it dropped from 118 microgrammes per cubic metre (µg/m3) on Tuesday to 40 µg/m3 on Saturday. “There was a spike in pollutants during Monday and Tuesday which could be due to more people using their own vehicles in the wake of restrictions. But it soon began to drop.,” said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR. Saturday’s AQI for Mumbai was 64, the best in 2020. An AQI between 51 and 100 is considering to be satisfactory.

. How did they do it and what was behind some of the steps the country took. Talking to TOI’s Indrani Bagchi, South Korea’s ambassador Shin Bong-Kil spelt out the steps taken by his country and how democracies have to do things differently. Excerpts:

Korea tackled the coronavirus issue very aggressively, resulting in fewer deaths. Tell us what was the thinking behind these moves.We thought that identifying and isolating the contagion in the early stages was the easiest way to fight coronavirus. We were successful. Also, we could treat patients well, which lowered the death rate. We developed the drive through test kit in early stages. Our bio companies worked at top speed to make both reagent and equipment. We could identify the geographical area of the infection and group early. It is an opaque religious group (Shincheonji) in the Daegu area, which has a church in Wuhan. They were heavily contaminated. We got a list of the group members and we made a comprehensive test of them. 60% of all Korea’s infected individuals cases were from this group. This province had almost 90% of all of Korea’s contamination.What is Korea doing to prevent the outflow of Covid-19?The Korean government is strictly controlling outbound travellers who could be described as “close contact”, i.e. one who has been within 2 meters of an infected person. These people are prohibited from leaving Korea. Until March 12, we had identified 22,000 of such “contacts”. They are not infected but they could be vectors. Our main airport is Incheon International Airport. We made it into a Covid-19-free zone. We have made mandatory, multi-step fever checks on all outbound passengers. We are screening strictly — three times in airport — departure hall, security checkpoint and boarding gate.What innovative steps did you take to fight this virus?Our drive-through test centre has been popular and is very effective. Now we have developed a walk-through test centre. You get the results by text message on your phone. Korea is a heavily wired country, so this is possible. We have six firms already manufacturing testing kits. If India has an interest, we can connect them. We have developed an app for fighting the virus. When you move, the GPS on your phone detects where you are and where you have travelled. That helps us quarantine areas where infected persons have visited. The app also helps us monitor the ‘self-quarantined’. If you break quarantine, you are detected. Yes, there are privacy issues, but we feel safety and health are more important. We are now producing a health certificate for travellers. Korea is the first to make this health certificate. Now India is asking for a similar certificate. We proposed that our authorised medical institutions produce this health certificate. Indians have called it a “ very good idea”.China says they have a model to deal with pandemics like coronavirus. Do you think democracies have a different model?The principles that governed our response are important — openness and transparency. At every stage, we were open to what was going on, numbers etc. That way we earned the trust of the people. They believed the government and are more open about obeying government instructions. In a democracy, we believe, this is most important. If you are an authoritarian government, you can control this information. But people don’t believe it. Like in North Korea — they say there is no coronavirus infection. But they have shut down the capital Pyongyang, even shut down embassies. India, the world’s largest democracy, should be open and transparent so that a nation of 1.3 billion could believe in the government to follow decisions.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-corona-fight-identifying-isolating-contagion-is-key/articleshow/74754503.cms

394,['22/03/2020'],3 crore construction labourers are now ‘consumers’,"NEW DELHI: In a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court has categorised over 2.8 crore registered construction workers as ‘ consumers ’ enabling them to move consumer forums if any government denied them statutory benefits promised under welfare schemes implemented with the funds collected as ‘cess’ from builders.

Under the Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Cess Act, 1996, each state was mandated to set up Welfare Boards which are to provide registered construction workers and their dependants immediate assistance under various heads — in case of accident, pension to over 60 year-olds, loans and advances for construction of house, premium for group insurance scheme for workers, financial assistance for education of their children, medical expenses for treatment of major ailments, maternity benefit to female workers, and provision and improvement of other welfare measures and facilities as prescribed.

A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and Ajay Rastogi said, “the registered workers are clearly beneficiaries of the service provided by the welfare board in a statutory capacity.” As of today, the states and Union government have collected nearly Rs 40,000 crore as cess from builders but have spent meagre percentage on welfare of registered construction workers.

Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Chandrachud said,“As a matter of interpretation, the provisions contained in the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 must be construed in a purposive manner. Parliament has provided a salutary remedy to consumers of both goods and services. Public authorities, such as the appellants who have been constituted under an enactment of Parliament, are entrusted with a solemn duty of providing welfare services to registered workers.”

“The workers who are registered with the Board make contributions on the basis of which they are entitled to avail of the services provided in terms of the schemes notified by the Board. Public accountability is a significant consideration which underlies the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 1986. The evolution of jurisprudence in relation to the enactment reflects the need to ensure a sense of public accountability by allowing consumers a redressal in the context of the discharge of non-sovereign functions which are not rendered free of charge. This test is duly met in the present case.,” the bench said.

399,['22/03/2020'],"FM Radio industry flags ‘deep crises’, seeks govt action","Faced with plummeting revenues and huge and rising costs, the Association of Radio Operators for India (AROI) has flagged the deep crises in the private FM radio industry and has urgently asked for ameliorative measures from the government including a one year moratorium on license fees. It has emphasized that this crises among private FM radio channels — an essential service for immediate dissemination of information in India’s densely populated cities and towns — has been hugely exacerbated with the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to major cuts in advertising across all industries and services, including the travel and entertainment sectors.In an urgent representation to the Information and Broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar . AROI, which is the umbrella body of all radio companies, has pointed out that this is resulting in an “unprecedented financial crisis” in the industry which employs over 20,000 people, with many companies contemplating cutting costs to survive, including cutting down staff, etc. AROI has warned that “in the current situation, it will be very difficult for the industry to sustain this workforce”.Private FM radio is the only content media industry which pays license fees as well as an annual revenue share to the Central government despite it being a small and infant industry. However, being free for subscribers, it is dependent on advertising, and even the small inflow from events has dried up due to cancellations owing to the coronavirus outbreak.With the license fee and revenue share regime not allowing the FM radio industry to grow to its full potential, the representation points out that the FM radio channels have now been faced with an especially difficult situation in this financial year, with a steep de-growth in advertising expenditure, coupled with a very steep fall in government advertising. With the coronavirus outbreak further deepening the crises, AROI has asked the government for immediate steps to save the FM radio industry including a one year moratorium on license fees and charges by government and Prasar Bharati/WPC, restoration of government advertising on private FM radio channels to normal levels so that they can get back on their feet and survive this crises–as well as urgent clearance of DAVP, NFDC and BSNL payments which have been held up for a long time.AROI has pointed out that it has been an active and responsible partner to the central government in the country’s socio-economic growth and has also contributed immensely through responsible messaging in management of natural and man-made disasters. It is also the emergency outreach to citizens in India’s towns and cities and many radio channels have won awards from government for their significant role in fighting disasters.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/fm-radio-industry-flags-deep-crises-seeks-govt-action/articleshow/74754541.cms

401,['22/03/2020'],Gyms shut? Goans have plenty of workout options,"The coronavirus threat has led to all gyms being shut in Goa till the end of the month, but that does not mean that fitness-conscious people have to stop exercising. From working out at home, or hitting a quiet corner at a nearby park or beach, the serious ones are finding their own ways to stay active, while the rest take this as an opportunity to ‘just chill at home’ and enjoy ‘cheat days’! We spoke to a few Goans to find out what they are up to.Last Saturday, the government directive stated that gyms would be shut for two weeks until March 31. Soon afterwards, gym instructors sprung into action – creating home workout plans for their clients or suggesting simpler way to stay fit during the pandemic. Some have started focusing on personal training for the time being. Model Narusha D’souza tell us, “My trainer comes home regularly. I usually do functional workouts, so it’s feasible at home. We focus on toning, so it works out well for me.”Fitness trainer Rendel Ferros has been delivering online training and also recommending home workouts to his clients. “There are a number of activities people can take up to keep themselves fit. I have recommended brisk walking for 45-60 minutes, followed by or alternated with free hand exercises like crossfit – jumping jacks, pushups, pullups, crunches and so on which you can do at your place. I also ask my clients to stick to vegetarian food or fish, and eat healthy food. It is important to have an immune system strong enough to battle this virus, so we need to focus on our diet and workout,” he says.Personal trainer Ashwyn Barreto has been posting regular home workout videos on social media for his followers. “Most 30-40 minutes workouts don’t require any equipment and only uses your body weight. I post short videos, by mentioning the duration of each exercise to be done,” he says. He also has his personal training clients online.Some trainers focus on small group workouts on the beach. Fitness trainer Abhijit Naik says, “Since gyms are shut, I take a few clients for an early morning beach workout in South Goa. We focus on functional training and cardio workout. I keep the updated through my social media and people join in whenever they want to.”Rohan Thakkar from Old Goa says he heads to a nearby park for calisthenics. “There are a few parks where you can do calisthenics, pull ups, monkey bar workouts and so on. So I do that and I am looking to borrow dumbbells to do other workouts. I just focus on body weight training otherwise. Usually I would work out twice when I went to the gym, but now I only work out once since I can’t,” says Rohan.Baga-based Raj Haldankar has been focusing on working out at home. “I’ve been doing body weight workouts at home and head to the beach for a run and swim during the evening. It is very surprising that there are very few people on Baga beach now. I sometimes head out with a football, and a few of us play for a while.” Similarly, Margao-based Shivani Divkar and her husband have been doing home workouts, along with an occasion run.Some have stated getting together in small groups to workout. Gaurav Pokle has started inviting a few friends over for a few hours of workouts. “I have a lot of space at home, so I invite my trainer and few of my friends' home and do some cardio and body weight workouts.”A number of people have just started running or cycling, now that gyms are shut. Santa Cruz Tracy tells us, “We have been going or runs and walks, or just running up and down stairs, and focusing on a healthy diet.” While some are focusing on runs or walks, Caranzalem-based Navreet Sarkaria has been doing a couple of hours of yoga at home, or occasionally on Caranzalem beach for a change.Model Milind Tendulkar tells us, “I used to cycle earlier, but ever since I started gym workouts, I stopped cycling. So now I am back to cycling 20-25 km every evening. I combine it with home workouts like push-ups, pull ups and others.” Eshaan Sinai Lotlikar from Santa Cruz has also started cycling now that gyms are shut. “One needs to stay active, so I cycle for a few hours after work every day,” he says.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74746748,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-515747/74746748.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/gyms-shut-goans-have-plenty-of-workout-options/articleshow/74746755.cms

The circular created a flutter across the state, prompting education minister Partha Chatterjee to step in. “I have instructed the directorate to put the programme on hold on Sunday,” he said.

“Procurement and preparatory work has to be completed by Sunday,” the directive says. Paschim Midnapore district inspector Chapeswar Sardar told TOI the directive was issued after the CM announced sending rice and potatoes in packets to students covered under the midday meal programme. “Now that schools are closed, heads of institutions have been told to arrange for procurement of the items. Guardians have been given four days to collect the packets,” he said.

Sardar believes school buildings have enough space to distribute the guardian load and prevent jamming. “There are enough rooms. Heads of institutions can spread the load. Guardians don’t need to come on a single day. We have a staggered 4-day schedule to collect the packets,” he said. Heads of institutions stressed distributing the load after the CM’s advice to avoid social gatherings.

Chatterjee hasn’t dropped the programme altogether. “I instructed the directorate to ensure procurement of rice and potatoes by school authorities is completed and food packets are distributed to guardians by today. The CM doesn’t want to keep students waiting for their midday meal quota. School authorities should finish the programme by Monday,” he said.

407,['22/03/2020'],"Coronavirus curbs trigger prison riot in Kolkata; one shot, eight hurt","KOLKATA: The global Covid-19 pandemic had an indirect fallout in Bengal on Saturday as undertrial prisoners ran riot inside the Dum Dum Central Correctional Home, setting fire to prison property and engaging security personnel in several rounds of pitched battles using bricks and axes and other sharp-edged weapons, forcing cops to open fire.One person died in the police firing and at least 28 prisoners, jail staffers and cops were injured and taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. Among the injured were OSD & ADG (Prisons) Arun Gupta and ADG (CID) SN Gupta.Several prisoners tried to scale the over 20-foot walls of Bengal’s largest prison facility during the riot, which continued for over eight hours in the middle of a crowded Dum Dum neighbourhood. Three others were caught trying to sneak out of the prison gates and there remains a possibility of a couple having escaped, officials said.The arsenal used by the undertrial prisoners indicated it was a “planned” jailbreak operation, officials said, but there were three immediate sparks, all linked to Covid-19 fears and several steps implemented by the government over the last one week to control its spread.One of the immediate causes was a decision by prison authorities on Friday to suspend till March 31 the bi-weekly prisoner “interviews” with family members; this would have significantly reduced the number of jail visitors.Another trigger was a government proposal for a 15-day special parole for lifers who had already spent 10 years in prison with certified “good conduct”; this would have led to the release of 500 lifers and freed up several cells for use as isolation wards.The third issue that the rioters mentioned was delayed court production of under-trials (courts are taking up only urgent matters and encouraging more video-conferencing).The first inkling of trouble came around 10.30 am on Saturday when a section of undertrials, demanding hand-sanitisers and masks, “started getting agitated”, officials said. This soon led to the demand that they be allowed their weekend “interviews” with family members. This was followed by slogans against parole applications being turned down (even aslifers’ ap[plications “were being allowed”).A scuffle then broke out between undertrials and convicts, with many lifers housed in Ward 9 being the first targets. A prison jailer tried to broker peace but was attacked and this became a free-for-all within minutes, with police and prison staffers being severely outnumbered.Reinforcements arrived around an hour later but, by then, under-trials had taken over the prison. They ransacked the canteen, set it on fire and hurled bricks at police even as some more tried to breach the prison wall. A group then reached the first floor of the prison office and started throwing stones at security guards outside.By 12.30 p.m., the administrative office housing the jailer’s cabin was on fire even as a section of under-trials reached the gate between the main compound and the jailer’s office and tried to break it open.“We received information about the fire around 12.20 p.m. We are not sure how and where it started,” state fire minister Sujit Bose said. Ten fire tenders were rushed to the spot as state as Bose’s colleague, food minister Jyotipriyo Mullick, arrived to help in the dialogue.A reinforced police team then started the counter-attack, first lobbing tear-gas shells at the warring groups and then finally opening fire when the under-trials showed no sign of backing away from their efforts to mow down the main gate. Officials said the force was instructed to “fire in the air”.Jail inmates backed away from the main gate but regrouped inside, bursting gas cylinders and continuing with their brick-batting. Barrackpore Police commissioner Manoj Verma then arrived with Rapid Action Force (RAF) and combat battalions after several security personnel were injured.The situation cooled down a bit around 3 p.m. and police started shifting the injured to the hospital but there were reports of violence continuing deep inside the prison. The situation flared up again around 4.30 p.m. and cops resorted to several more rounds of firing. A tenuous peace returned only after that.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74755451,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-281028,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/riot-erupts-in-dum-dum-jail-undertrial-killed-in-firing/articleshow/74753923.cms

BENGALURU: A 35-year-old man, who presumed he was not being respected by his family members for failing to find a job, allegedly murdered his two daughters following an argument with his wife. The incident occurred on Friday night in an apartment complex in Hulimavu.

Jatin Kumar, who smothered three-year-old Taushini and 18-month-old Shastha with a pillow, was arrested. The incident came to light when his wife Lakshmi Shankari, a software engineer with a company in Electronics City, returned home from work around 9.45pm and found the children lying motionless on the bed.

""She initially thought they were unconscious. Soon she started screaming and pleading for help and we rushed to find out what was wrong. Someone called the police control room and cops, who arrived in a Hoysala vehicle, confirmed the children were dead,"" a neighbour said.

Police took Jatin, who had locked himself in another room, into custody and arrested him after he confessed to having killed his daughters.

A native of Kerala, Jatin was married to Tamil Nadu-based Lakshmi, sources said. ""He had changed many jobs in the past few years and had stopped looking for one. He was depressed over being jobless and would often shout at his wife and kids saying they were not respecting him. On Friday, he fought with Lakshmi over the phone for the same reason. He took the kids inside and killed them,"" police said.

412,['22/03/2020'],Withdrawal limits for PMC Bank accounts extended by 3 months,"MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has extended the moratorium on Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank, which restricts withdrawals for a further period of three months from March 23, 2020 to June 22, 2020.

RBI has said that the withdrawal limit, which has been progressively hiked to Rs 50,000, has enabled 78% of depositors to recover their funds. However, there are still thousands of depositors and co-operative credit societies whose members’ funds are stuck in PMC. “The RBI has been discussing with various authorities the expeditious sale of securities and recovery of loans. Due to various factors, including legal processes, tangible outcomes are taking some time,” RBI said in a statement.

The Bombay high court on January 15 had appointed a three-member committee headed by a retired judge to sell the encumbered assets of Housing Development Infrastructure Limited (HDIL) to recover dues payable to the bank. RBI had approached the Supreme Court for a stay against this order on the grounds that assets need to be sold as part of the bank’s resolution plan. PMC Bank was placed under a moratorium on September 23, 2019, after a bulk of the deposits lent to HDIL through thousands of fictitious accounts turned into bad loans.

Clarificiation: The report ‘Withdrawal curbs for PMC Bank a/cs extended by 3 mths’, carried in the March 22 TOI Print edition, inadvertently reported that the withdrawal limit is Rs 75,000. The general withdrawal limit for PMC Bank continues to be Rs 50,000. The error is regretted.

415,['22/03/2020'],‘Congress lacks efficient tiers of management in Madhya Pradesh’,"Congress Rajya Sabha MP and Madhya Pradesh functionary Vivek Tankha says the obituary of the Kamal Nath government was written the day it was sworn in. In a conversation with TOI’s Subodh Ghildiyal, the senior lawyer attributes the departure of Jyotiraditya Scindia and a sizeable number of MLAs to loose ends in Congress’s organisational structure in the state. Excerpts:

How did so many Congress MLAs quit the party which led to the collapse of the MP government?

The immediate reason for that is poaching of our MLAs by BJP. But it could happen only because of problems within Congress. Our problems facilitated BJP’s poaching and BJP excels in it. It is a well-funded party.

But how could MP Congress with campaigners like Kamal Nath, Digvijaya Singh , Jyotiraditya Scindia go so wrong?

I had always heard from these three functionaries that success of any democratic government depends on sharing, that one should learn to share. Somewhere, that principle was missing this time.

Is the perception correct that Scindia did not see a future for himself in Madhya Pradesh Congress ?

I think his space in politics, created over 35 years including tenure of his father, was in Congress. He will never find the same space in BJP. In Congress, he was virtually seen as a star. But he left because possibly he didn’t see a future for himself.

If things were going so wrong, did anyone ever voice concerns about functioning of state Congress?

About a month back, I suggested that for a good organisation , you need efficient tiers of management — an efficient CM, an effective state president and an AICC general secretary in-charge who enjoys overarching confidence. In case of MP, the general secretary was too junior to deal with three senior members like Kamal Nath, Digvijaya Singh and Scindia. There was no independent Congress president. So, if issues arose in the state, there was none to resolve them. I was among the few who was speaking on these issues from first day. But though a senior lawyer with political awareness, I was considered new to politics and whatever I said was never taken seriously. The fact is that the day we formed the government and the way it was done, we wrote its obituary. This was writ large through the state. For a stable government, the four independent MLAs and three from SP and BSP should have been part of the government. Senior Congress MLAs got left out of the government and were angry from Day one. This was the genesis of this crisis.

But why was such an elementary step of coalition politics not followed?

I can’t answer this. Only higher leadership can answer this.

That the government formed after 15 years could not last 15 months is a big failure for members like Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh who were touted as masters of political management?

They themselves are as disappointed today. What has happened, they could not have imagined. They had an inkling of this trouble but it is the magnitude of the exodus that has shocked them.

What is the road ahead for Congress in MP?

Congress needs to rebuild itself. It has to bring in new, young people in the organisation. We need to once again start from the grassroots and create an organisation which can fight future polls. In last one and half years, no party meetings have been held at block or district levels. There was no plan or strategy, everything was Bhopal-centric. If there is no thought in this direction, how will we strengthen the organisation. Every party has to look after the organisation besides good governance. MP is a two-party system and disenchantment with BJP government would lead people to Congress. But to revitalise the party, we have to start from the bottom. The victory in MP was not a victory of Congress but a defeat of BJP.

Can such a factionalised Congress unit rebuild after this setback?

Whatever is the leadership in MP, it should not encourage factionalism. It should instead try to encourage growth of local leadership.

MUMBAI: The municipal corporation and police were inundated with calls about people who have returned from foreign countries and marked with the ‘home quarantine’ stamp moving around in public, instead of staying at home.

While the police control room received more than two dozen calls on Saturday, the BMC’s twitter handle got two complaints from anxious neighbours. Municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi immediately got his men to get the errant residents to SevenHills Hospital. Pardeshi said the BMC will also register FIRs against the duo under IPC Section 188 for disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant. “Despite being given the advantage of home quarantine they choose to disobey. There may be others doing the same. We want to make an example of them so others do not move out when under quarantine,” Pardeshi said.

In another incident, a few residents of BDD chawl in Worli complained to the police that three Dubai-returned people were roaming in the neighbourhood. The police sent the trio to forced quarantine at Kasturba Hospital. “Our teams have caught a few of the violators and put them under forced quarantine...we will now start taking stern action in such cases,” said Vinoy Choubey, joint commissioner of police (law and order).

Meanwhile, Mulund MLA Mihir Kotecha intervened in a case wherein a few students were found roaming outside Mulund home after returning from a foreign trip. The students are now staying isolated at their homes. The Kharghar police, accompanied by a doctor and Panvel civic officials, visited a residential tower to check on 37-year-old man, who had returned from the US and was home quarantined. The resident was found to be asymptomatic after a check, but he was advised not to step out till 14 days.

NEW DELHI: In a first, Delhi assembly has curtailed its budget session to just one day following the novel coronavirus outbreak in the country. The budget will be presented and passed the same day.

This is also the first time that the budget session will not begin with the speech of the lieutenant governor. According to the list of business prepared by the Delhi assembly secretariat, the one-day budget session will begin with tabling of the copy of economic survey of 2019-20 by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the charge of finance department.

It will be followed by the status report of the outcome budget 2019-20 (up to December 2019). The document provides insight into the output and outcome of the allocations made under the state budget for various projects. Following this, Sisodia will present his sixth consecutive annual budget for FY 2020-21. He will later table the supplementary demands for grants for the FY 2019-20 and appropriation bills.

To ensure there was lesser number of people in the assembly, the government has decided not to allow the guests and visitors to the House. Delhi assembly secretariat has also allowed its staff, which was not required for the session, to work from home.

Former secretary general of Lok Sabha, PDT Achary, said that extraordinary situations call for extraordinary measures. “The tabling of economic survey, presentation of budget and discussion on it could have been spaced out if there was time.

NEW DELHI: There was a ruckus at Arjun Nagar in Safdarjung Enclave after a Ugandan national allegedly abused police officers and pelted stones at them on the intervening night of Friday and Saturday. A passerby recorded a video of the 23-year-old abusing the cops.

The cops had earlier asked a group of African women who were standing on the roadside not to gather at a place. Following this, the Ugandan woman allegedly started creating a ruckus. She later alleged that she was molested and the cops also attempted to rape her.

According to police, about 11.30pm, two officers from Safdarjung Enclave police station were patrolling the area on a motorcycle. They saw a few women standing beside the road and asked them not to gather there. “One of them started arguing with the police officers. Suddenly, she started throwing stones at the officers and abused them in Hindi. A man who was recording her act was also attacked,” said a senior police officer.

“The drama went on for 20 minutes and a woman constable had to be called in from the police station. During the argument, the Ugandan woman also undressed herself.”

“Her medical examination ruled out any sexual abuse,” the officer added.

“Around 12.15am, I heard a noise coming from the main road. When I reached there, I saw a woman completely naked and three male police officers present. She had come to meet her female friend, but the cops molested and tried to rape her. I have written to the senior police officers as well as the Ugandan embassy, but not received any reply from them so far. The victim resides in Gurugram and was in the country for her father’s treatment,” stated the victim’s lawyer Shahab Ahmad.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu government is set to pass a new law to create special reservation for students of government schools in medical college admission, said chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, making a suo motu statement in the assembly on Saturday.

""The state is still fighting a legal battle in the Supreme Court against the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (Neet). The reservation will be for students who study from Class I to XII in government, corporation, municipal or adi-dravida schools as well as those run by the forest department,"" said Palaniswami.

""The number of government school students entering medical colleges has come down drastically after the introduction of Neet. The government wants to stop this trend. A committee under the chairmanship of a retired high court judge will study the issue and make recommendations to the government. The commission will have secretaries of the health and law departments as members. Besides, two educationists named by the school education department will be included in the commission. The director of medical education will be the member-secretary of the commission,"" said the chief minister.

The commission will study the reason for the poor entry of government school students into medical colleges and assess their social conditions before making recommendations to rectify the trend, Palaniswami said. The commission will submit its recommendations in a month.

Though NEET was introduced in 2016-17, late chief minister J Jayalalithaa had obtained an exemption for a year. ""We have been opposing NEET. We adopted a resolution in the assembly and sent it to the Centre. We have also approached the Supreme Court and explained how the examination had severely affected the poor and students from rural areas,"" he said.

A notification issued by the state home department on Sunday also included hookah bars, massage parlours, amusement parks, museums and zoos in the list of places that must remain closed till the end of the month.

While both the restaurants’ bodies in the city — National Restaurants Association of India (NRAI) and Hotel and Restaurants’ Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) — had asked members to stay shut on Sunday, they have now been forced to extend the closure. “We shall go by the state government directive and all our members will close down their respective bars and restaurants till March 31. Personally, I have closed my restaurants and bars from Saturday itself. Some of our members, too, have done that,” said Parnav Singh, president HRAEI. Singh has three restaurant-cum-bars in New Town and Sector V.

435,['22/03/2020'],"Weight loss: From being joked about, people call me an inspiration now!","If you thought ghar ka khana is full of oil and spices and couldn't help you lose weight, think again. Abhinav Mishra's weight loss story is an example that eating the right food and counting calories can help you get in shape, without having to quit on your favourites.To know how he lost 32 kilos in 10 months, read his transformation story below:Abhinav MishraSoftware Engineer265 feet 8 inchesNoida100 kilos32 kilos10 monthsI always felt lethargic, sluggish and underconfident. I was also diagnosed with a thyroid imbalance. It was in May 2019 I decided to take things into my hand and work on myself.My breakfast is the heaviest meal of my day, ranging from 800 - 900 calories. Initially, I had a roti/paratha with dal and sabzi, but these days as I am working on building abs, I just have 2 - 3 cups of daal with half a cup of rice and a protein shake.I generally eat a paneer sandwich(brown bread) for lunch and another cup or two of daal, if I feel hungry.I tend to skip dinner or eat some fruits/ salad. I have a glass of milk before I go to bed.I have no set pre-workout meal, just something with a few carbs and protein. Sometimes, it's just a coffee.I just have a protein shake after my workout which is usually early in the morning (6 am).I still try to not cheat too much and practice portion control. If I eat from outside, I moderate or skip the next meal. Although I do try to make healthier choices with junk food now. My favourites are momos, sandwiches and grilled platters.Initially, I started slow. I exercised for 20 mins every day following a YouTube video I found online. After about 2 months or so I started to see results. I lost around 6 kgs of weight in this while. Post this, I decided to take my diet and workout to the next level.I wake up every day at 5 am in the morning and go to the gym at 6 am. This way my workout is complete by 8 am. I do a PUSH-PULL LEGS split, and add 10 mins of cardio every day. I run on Sunday. I also do 6-7 ab workouts after office.I would like to tell people to not shy away from Indian food. Dal is very low calorie and full of protein. Chole and rajma have a lot of good fibre plus protein. Paneer and grilled veggies, too are nutritious and taste well.Start slow and build a habit. Cut off the junk, you know what it is. Diet is 70% of the game, and exercise only 30. You don't need any special diet, just track what you eat, add portion control, and switch to healthier choices. Slowly get used to your new diet. Fitness is a marathon, not a race.To be honest, more than motivation, it is the discipline that matters. You do it with a goal in mind and you do it for yourself, nothing else is going to work better. Sometimes, you have to simply PUSH yourself and make it to the gym I haven't missed a single day of workout and when I couldn't make it, I used to work out at home. If the gym was closed, I would go running. Only when I was unwell I took a break. If you enjoy your workout, it won't feel bad. You have to build that habit.You are going to have ups and downs. It is alright that you missed your workout for a day, or your diet wasn't perfect for a day. Keep your eyes on the bigger picture.Don't compare your progress to others. Keep working on yourself and keep improving wherever you can, and you will see results soon.Being overweight affects your confidence, makes you feel sluggish and lethargic and is bad for your health in the long term. I am amazed by the changes I feel after being in shape.I want to sport a chiselled look and not have a dad-bod.Food is fuel for your body. Making small, disciplined changes lead to exponential results. I now eat out but do not overindulge. Working out regularly also helps me fight stress. I also make sure to drink atleast 3-4 litres of water every day. My sleep schedule is back on track too.It has to be the time when I was constantly feeling lethargic and devoid of energy. I am young, I shouldn't be this unhealthy. Some people told me that I can't keep fit for life, but I just shrugged those negative feedback off.From being joked about, to random people coming up to me in office, society and my relatives telling me that I inspire them, it has been quite a journey.What I would say is, do not do things to impress people. Work out for yourself and this way, you avoid the negativity too. Nothing will get you farther than discipline. You don't need any special diet, just track what you eat, add portion control, and switch to healthier choices.Weight loss is not difficult. Everyone can do it.If you have a weight loss story to share, send it to us at toi.health1@gmail.com",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74733418,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-890412/74733418.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/weight-loss/weight-loss-this-engineer-gave-up-junk-food-for-ghar-ka-khana-and-lost-32-kilos-in-10-months/articleshow/74733418.cms

Though the family had distributed wedding cards to about 400 guests, the event was postponed in view of the rise in Covid-19 cases in India.

Davinderpal, sarpanch of Meherban and brother of to-be groom Sandeep Kumar, said, “With coronavirus cases taking a heavy toll, we can’t take any chance and put lives of our guests at risk. So we along with the family of the bride thought over it and decided unanimously to postpone the marriage. We will decide about the future date once the situation turns normal,” said Devinderpal, who runs a T-shirt making unit at Gehlewal.

“We had distributed the wedding cards among our about 400 guests, but now we are calling them up to inform about our decision. The bride’s family, based in Kapurthala, had made arrangements for the function at a dharamshala at Khalwada village in Kapurthala and we were to hold a reception at our home.” He said they had completed their shopping for the marriage.

The family was also renovating the house before the reception. Though everyone in the family was excited about the marriage, they are worried about the spread of coronavirus.

Meanwhile, Sandeep Kumar said eventually he would get married, but safety of family members and guests is more important than the event. “This is our social responsibility and we will fulfill it,” he added.

“I am still excited as I will get married once the threat of coronavirus subsides,” said Sandeep.

Not only has the family postponed the marriage, their members are also creating awareness against the virus.

“We are taking precautionary measures regarding Covid-19. As a sarpanch of the village, I also create awareness about the virus among villagers,” Davinderpal said.

Box: Palaces closed, but no bar on marriages

Ludhiana deputy commissioner Pardeep Aggarwal said though marriage palaces have been closed, there is no prohibition on organising marriages. District public relations officer Prabhdeep Singh Nathowal said gathering in marriages has been restricted to 20 persons only.

Mary, who secured an Olympic quota at the Asia-Oceania Olympic Qualifiers in Amman, returned home and was supposed to be in self-isolation till March27. But the 37-year-old, who is also a Rajya Sabha MP, attended a breakfast get-together hosted by President Ram Nath Kovind at the Rashtrapati Bhavan on March 18.

At the same get-together, BJP’s Dushyant Singh , who had earlier come in contact with Covid-19 positive Bollywood singer Kanika Kapoor , was also present. Singh is now in self-quarantine.

In one of the four pictures tweeted by the official Twitter handle of the President on March 18, Mary can be seen standing alongside other MPs.

Mary was quoted by IANS as saying, “I am home since I came back from Jordan. I only attended the President’s event and did not meet Dushyant Singh or shake hands with him.”

Sources told TOI, “The President had invited Mary personally. This was done a long time back. She (Mary) couldn’t say no to the President. She had to honour the commitment as she is a Rajya Sabha MP. It has been an extraordinary set of circumstances. Very difficult to point out who is right and who is wrong.”

India’s chief boxing coach, Santiago Nieva had said on Friday that members of the Indian boxing contingent, who represented the country in Jordan, are all under the mandatory 14-day selfquarantine .

“Earlier, we had planned for 10 days but now it is mandatory 14 days for everyone. So, after 10 days, I will work on a training programme that I will send to the boxers after their self-quarantine period is over. They can get back to practice mode, starting with that. If things remain the same in the country even after two weeks, then we will have to continue with the training programme,” Nieva had said.

Earlier on Friday, Mary said she had “self-isolated herself at her Delhi residence” since returning from Jordan. “I am chilling, doing my exercises, taking care of my fitness and playing with my children after being away from them for almost one month. That’s the best part of this isolation. I am with my family throughout the day without having to think of anything.

“My appeal to everyone is don’t panic, try and stay at home if you can and spend time with your family. In my case, I have felt a sense of freedom with this isolation. I have realised that I am not feeling the stress of a daily schedule right now,” she was quoted by PTI.

On Friday, several local markets also run out of wheat flour. Though the prices stabilised on Saturday, wholesalers blamed the retailers for the surge pricing.

CHENNAI: Two suspected female infanticide cases have emerged in Theni and Madurai districts in recent times, however, a report tabled by the state government in the assembly on Saturday says that only one-fourth of the fund - 39 lakh of 1.57 crore - allotted for the cradle baby scheme was spent in the last four years, until January.

The scheme, launched by former chief minister J Jayalalithaa in 1992 in Salem, was the first of its kind in the country to eradicate the practice of female infanticide in certain vulnerable pockets of the state. The babies received at the government-run cradle baby centres are given for adoption to people, both within and outside the country. A policy note tabled by social welfare minister V Saroja in the House said the government had provided 44.12 lakh in the budget estimate for the next fiscal too.

The DMK, the main opposition, charged that continuation of the evil practice in the state was a blot on the AIADMK government. ""Government's failure to create proper awareness is the reason for the scourge continuing. What are the officials doing? The state should own up the responsibility. These practices have taken Tamil Nadu 30 years backwards. There is no protection for women in the state,"" Tuticorin MLA P Geetha Jeevan alleged.

Saroja said that since the inception of the scheme in 1992, about 5,400 babies were received at the centres and freed from the clutches of death. As many as 161 babies, including 52 male babies were received under the scheme during the current fiscal. District officials had been instructed to take stringent action to put an end to the menace, she said.

Reeling out various welfare measures , the minister said the government had deposited more than 1,523 crore in the names of 9.7 lakh girls. The maturity amount would be available to the girls once they complete 18 years of age.

DMK MLA A P Nandakumar alleged that districts like Dharmapuri, Theni, Dindigul and Namakkal had seen a fall in child sex ratio owing to female infanticide. Bride grooms in these districts were looking for brides in other districts, he said. Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami intervened at this stage and said the government had reduced the maternal and infant mortality rate in the state.

CHENNAI: A 29-year-old city resident raped his 10-year-old neighbour and hurled her to death from the terrace of a two-storey building early on Saturday, police said and identified the accused man as Suresh. A court later sent him to jail.

Around 12.15am, a police officer said, the Class V student, who stayed on the first floor, stepped out of the residence and walked towards the washroom close to the staircase. Suresh, a construction worker who stayed on the second floor, was near the staircase when the girl came out of the washroom. Suresh, who was drunk at the time, forced the girl into his room and raped her after covering her mouth with his hand, the officer said, based on the man's confession statement.

As she slumped to the floor unconscious, Suresh took her to the terrace and flung her to the ground, into a clump of bushes at the rear.

Around 1am, the victim's parents woke up and found their only child missing. They screamed for help and some neighbours, including Suresh, joined them in their search.

The child's parents rushed to Maduravoyal police station around 3am on Saturday. A police team led by inspector Radhakrishnan spotted the girl's body from behind the building, and sent it to KMC hospital for autopsy.

Suresh held for murder, under Pocso Act

As the terrace had a four foot-high parapet, police ruled out the possibility of the child falling from the terrace. As there were evidences of sexual assault, police started questioning the neighbours. Suresh, who denied the crime, later confessed to it, said police.

Suresh’s family had been staying at the rented house for the past one year and he was working as a labourer at a construction site near his house. Suresh’s wife had left for her parents’ house in Kolathur around 8.30pm on Friday as their children were studying at a school there.

According to police, Suresh had hurled the child to the ground from the terrace to make it look like an accident.

The girl’s father was working in a private firm, and mother a homemaker. She was their only child. The Maduravoyal police have registered a case of murder and slapped Pocso case on Suresh. He was produced before a magistrate court in the city and remanded to Puzhal prison.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

All this while, cops were left in a tizzy. They even went to the civil hospital to fetch some doctors, but got no help.

Finally, the officials had to return while asking the elderly woman to get herself checked in the morning and quarantine self for 14 days.

Earlier, suspecting that the woman had symptoms of coronavirus, the residents had tried to contact ‘112’ police helpline. As they did not get through, someone called up police commissioner Rakesh Agarwal.

Soon, Agarwal sent a team comprising assistant commissioner of police (detective) Surinder Mohan; inspector Satpal Singh, SHO, division number 2 police station; sub-inspector Arshdeep Kaur Grewal, SHO, Jodhewal police station to the area.

Inspector Satpal Singh said, “Around 12 mid night, they got to know about the panic situation in Field Gunj. The police found that a 66-year-old woman had come from England to visit her relative in the city. Thereafter, police approached the family who revealed that the woman had diarrhea. They also informed that the woman had gone through screening at Delhi airport.”

The inspector said since cops are not experts in checking health, they called up doctors at the civil hospital. “We waited there for over half an hour, but nobody turned up for her medical examination,” he added.

Sub-inspector Arshdeep Kaur Grewal said, “When no medical team reached the spot, I visited the Ludhiana civil hospital. I asked three doctors on duty to accompany me to the area to screen the woman, but they refused to come, saying they can’t leave the hospital.”

“I asked them if there is some medical team which can come along, there answer was in negative. Finally, we had to ask the woman to get her tests done in the morning and keeping herself in quarantine for 14 days,” Grewal added.

Chief medical official and civil surgeon Rajesh Bagga said, “We have trained cops that medical examination is needed only if persons have symptoms of coronavirus like fever, cough, cold and breathlessness. If the person has no such symptoms, they are simply advised for home quarantine.”

“Diarrhea is not a symptom of coronavirus. However, for details examination in this case, the cops could have called up ‘108’ ambulance to take her to the hospital where doctors were available,” he added.

Medical helpdesk | 161-2444193

Ludhiana residents can contact the health department on the number if they have symptoms of flu. Consultant on the helpdesk will inquire and guide them accordingly, informed Dr Bagga.

“Those who have flu-like symptoms, but no travel history can approach their family doctor. Else they can approach the urban community health care centres, dispensaries in slum areas, sub-divisional hospitals in rural areas and district hospitals,” he added.

Those with symptoms and travel history can approach the community health centres, sub-divisional hospitals, district hospital, for isolation wards if needed.

Residents can also call 108 ambulance to reach the civil hospital for test if needed.

Residents can approach the health department if anyone from their locality has recent returned from coronavirus-affected countries.

Doc-turned-ADCP counsels family

Additional deputy commissioner of police (PBI) Sachin Gupta said, ""As no medical team visited the area, I as a qualified doctor talked to the woman and her relatives. I asked for their symptoms and suggested to get the test done in the morning. Besides, I have asked the entire family, including a 12-year-old child, to home quarantine for 14 days.” Gupta said he has also asked senior officials to get fever guns and biohazard suits for cops. “Thus the cops can check fever of people, while ensuring their safety. A company under CSR activity has agreed to give us biohazard suits,” he added.

UK-returned woman taken for check-up

A 70-year-old woman from Model Town, who had returned from the United Kingdom on March 4, was taken for medical examination on Saturday evening after locality residents called up the police to give information about her. Inspector Pawan KUmar, SHO, Model Town police station, visited the area and called a medical team at the spot.

Inspector Pawan Kumar said the elderly woman does not have any flu-like symptoms and moreover, she had remained in home quarantine. But to be on the safe side, cops and the medical team asked her to go for the medical examination.

NEW DELHI: Amazon .com Inc said on Saturday it is raising overtime pay for associates working in its US warehouses as the world's largest online retailer tries to meet the rapidly growing demand for online shopping from consumers stuck at home during the coronavirus outbreak.Chief executive officer Jeff Bezos , the world's richest person, also said on Saturday, ""My own time and thinking is now wholly focused on COVID-19 and on how Amazon can best play its role,"" according to a message posted on a company website.Hourly workers at Amazon's US warehouses will receive double pay after 40 hours for overtime, up from the 1.5-times rate, from March 15 through May 9, the rate increase announcement said.This is the second time the e-commerce giant announced an increase in pay for its workers in a week. On Monday, Amazon hiked the minimum hourly rate for associates to $17 from $15 and announced plans to hire 1,00,000 warehouse and delivery workers in the United States as the virus outbreak boosts online orders.As the virus spreads across the US, Amazon has offered unlimited unpaid time off to encourage employees to stay home if they do not feel well. It has also staggered workers shifts and prohibited employees from sitting next to each other in the lunchroom to limit contact.But four Democratic US senators, including Cory Booker and Bernie Sanders on Friday expressed concern in a letter to Bezos that Amazon has not taken enough measures to protect its warehouse staff. They specifically asked if the company would provide “time-and-a-half” hazard pay for its workers.In response to Saturday's wage news, one of the letter's signatories, senator Robert Menendez said he applauded the decision but that Amazon still had work to do to protect employees.Bezos said in Saturday's online post that Amazon has ordered ""millions"" of face masks for its on-site staff, but few have been filled because the masks are in low supply and are first going to hospitals at governments' directions.""When our turn for masks comes, our first priority will be getting them in the hands of our employees and partners working to get essential products to people,"" he said.Amazon on Thursday reported its first warehouse employee in the United States tested positive for the virus, forcing the company to temporarily shutter the facility in New York As the virus spreads across the United States, several clothing retailers and department-store chains have shut stores, and cafe and restaurant operators have closed down or limited services to delivery and take-away.Online retailers and grocery stores are trying to capture rising demand as more Americans are ordered to stay at home to reduce the spread of the outbreak.Rival retailer Walmart Inc said on Thursday it plans to hire 1,50,000 hourly associates in the US and announced $550 million in cash bonuses to reward workers.The highly contagious coronavirus has infected more than 2,74,800 people across the world and led to more than 11,300 deaths globally, forcing governments across the world to issue mass lockdowns of people in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74755042,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-482183,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/amazon-raises-overtime-pay-for-warehouse-workers/articleshow/74755051.cms
463,['22/03/2020'],Times Kitchen Tales 2: Familiarity breeds confidence,"Martial arts exist in India too. Yet we only talk about Japan, Korea and China,” said Sanjay Bansode. I spoke to him after I was mesmerised by a Mardani Khel display in Nashik. It was performed by the young boys and girls from Kolhapur and Pune, trained in the Mardani Sports Association of Maharashtra, which Bansode runs. The roots of Mardani Khel can be traced to the guerrilla warfare practised by warriors – from the time of Chhatrapati Shivaji. This indigenous martial art took the form of a folk game taught in the talims (training centres) in villages around Kolhapur, when the use of weapons by Indians was banned by the British. The tradition continues today.Why just martial arts? It would be fair to say that Indian cuisine too is yet to get to the sort of recognition that it deserves, and for that to happen, we need to become ambassadors of our everyday food. This is why we invite you to share your stories at the Times Kitchen Tales.Here is one from Nashik, known as a pilgrimage hub. In recent years the city has been positioned as a ‘wine country’ too. To the city’s food lovers, Nashik is the ‘misal capital of the world’, and opinions vary on where you get the best. I got my misal fix at Tushar Misal at College Road. Vivekraj Thakur, a passionate Nashik food enthusiast and media entrepreneur, accompanied me. He’s been going there from his school days. Cooked matki (sprouts) lie at its heart. You pour the steaming portion of rassa (gravy) given on the side. Besan and powdered local millets give a silken creamy feel to the rassa at Tushar’s. The chilli oil that floats up while cooking the rassa is called tari. This is served separately and you add it to get your preferred level of chilli heat. Thick crispy shev is tucked in below the sprouts before it is served. Doesn’t it get soggy?“The real taste lies in the shev soaking in the flavours of the rassa,” says Abhishek Patil, 30. His grandfather, the late Shivaji Khanderao Patil, had started this eatery in 1966 after working as a farmer and then a murmura (puffed rice) making unit owner. Back in the day, the misal was served with chapati, not pav.Another childhood favourite of Vivekraj that I got to taste was the pineapple ice cream at the Samarth Juice Centre (estd in 1958). A bowl of joy consisting of pineapple-flavoured ice cream, which has bits of stewed pineapple in it, served in flavoured milk.We went to the more crowded Old Nashik and had the sabudana vada at Sayantara, located near the Bhadrakali flower market. The shop was started in 1967 and is run by the Bhavsar family. Compared to the spherical sabudana vadas that one gets in Mumbai, these are flatter and hence crunchier – with crushed fried peanuts interspersed in between. The house spice sprinkled on it adds a dimension of heat which is balanced by the crushed peanuts, millet and dahi based chutney served liberally with the sabudana vada. The done thing in Nashik is to go to the nearby Budha Halwai and have the jalebis there after the Sayantara vadas.Vivekraj told me that restaurants serving Khandeshi (north west Maharashtra) mutton have become popular of late here. I went to Renuka Khanawal (an eatery) at Canada Corner for a taste of this. Khanawals are small eateries, which serve home- cooked food; patrons are mostly men. The special mutton thali with mutton fry, mutton rassa and kheema, turned out to be a meat lover’s delight thanks to excellent quality of tender, slow cooked mutton that was served. Though spicy on the whole, each dish was distinct inits flavour. Giving the mutton company was zinga chatani (dried shrimps), crisp bajara bhakaris and soft chapatis freshly made by a couple of aajis (grandmothers), and sticky Indrayani rice. Anil Gite, the middle-aged owner of this four- year-old eatery (referred to as Bapu by his customers) went from table to table personally, welcoming each customer, with a sense of warmth typical to the people of Nashik. “Masta smile maro” is what he said to me when he brought my order and I happily followed his advice.Exercise: What are the dishes from your city that you would like visitors to try, and tell us why.By: Kalyan KarmakarHow can you be a part of this?

A majority have shown no symptoms of Covid-19 and many of those who have undergone the test but tested negative have also been advised to quarantine themselves at home.“Merely because they have shown no symptoms or tested negative by no means indicates they are clear,” said officials at Mumbai’s Kasturba laboratory, which till a few days ago was the only centre for Covid-19 testing.What it really means is that there is a possibility that they may have just contracted the coronavirus (Day 1 or Day 2). The viral load required for detection may not have sufficiently built up and hence would not show up in the tests. “There may not be enough viral load to enable detection. This viral load will build up by Day 4-5,” said Dr Jayanti Shastri, head, Kasturba molecular lab. Dr Shastri said equipment used for Covid-19 testing are very sensitive and with a good limit of detection (LOD).But presence of the virus in a person may be even lower than LOD and so it does not get detected. “By Day 4-5, the viral load in a person will build up. Patients tested should be vigilant about symptoms,” she said.Even if this does not show positive, it does not mean the person is in the clear. There are at least two instances where people have tested positive on the 14th day, and hence the need for the compulsory 14-day quarantine. In Bhutan, a US woman tourist tested negative three times but on the fourth test on the 14th day tested positive. In many buildings, residents are stressed that those returning from abroad are not self-isolating.BMC chief Praveen Pardeshi said many do not exhibit symptoms when they arrive and may not even be infected, but it is out of abundant precaution that BMC asks them to quarantine themselves and gives them the advantage of being quarantined at home rather than at a civic quarantine hospital.Singer Kanika Kapoor, who returned from London last week, instead of being quarantined chose to socialise in the interim period. “Initial negative result does not mean free of virus.

The Tamil Nadu government is set to pass a new law to create special reservation for students of government schools in medical college admission, said chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami , making a suo motu statement in the assembly on Saturday.

“The state is still fighting a legal battle in the Supreme Court against the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test ( NEET ). The reservation will be for students who study from Class I to XII in government, corporation, municipal or adi-dravida schools as well as those run by the forest department,” said Palaniswami.

“The number of government school students entering medical colleges has come down drastically after the introduction of NEET. The government wants to stop this trend. A committee under the chairmanship of a retired high court judge will study the issue and make recommendations to the government. The commission will have secretaries of the health and law departments as members. Besides, two educationists named by the school education department will be included in the commission. The director of medical education will be the member secretary of the commission,” said the chief minister.

The commission will study the reason for the poor entry of government school students into medical colleges and assess their social conditions before making recommendations to rectify the trend, Palaniswami said. The commission will submit its recommendations in a month.

Though NEET was introduced in 2016-17, late chief minister J Jayalalithaa had obtained an exemption for a year. “We have been opposing NEET. We adopted a resolution in the assembly and sent it to the Centre. We have also approached the Supreme Court and explained how the examination had severely affected the poor and students from rural areas,” he said.

At least three hospitals are on the verge of exhausting their PPE stock and are waiting for fresh supplies from the state government which has promised a set of 100 PPEs to each hospital.RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) is reduced to a ‘minimal stock’ of PPE and is waiting for support from the government. “We have sought fresh supply,” said RTIICS zonal director R Venkatesh. AMRI Hospitals, too, has just enough to cover their core team of doctors and nurses. “State government will start providing PPE from Monday. Unless it arrives, we will run out of gear soon,” said an AMRI spokesperson.Another private hospital off EM Bypass said it may run out of stock before Monday and was staring at an emergency. “Our medical staff are obviously wary and the use of PPE has increased suddenly. Our stocks started depleting earlier this week and now we are down to almost zero. Unless the state government stocks arrive, it will be a crisis for us,” said a hospital official.Meanwhile, private hospitals are also busy scaling up facilities to meet a Covid-19 emergency. AMRI, for instance, has created an SOP for doctors and other frontline healthcare workers who are being briefed accordingly. “All our critical-care beds are equipped with or have the provision for retrofitting ventilators. We have also ordered for more equipment and PPE for our personnel,” said a hospital spokesperson.Fortis Hospital Anandapur has 10 beds in total. There are isolation rooms at the Emergency Department , ICU and wards, ready to isolate COVID -19 patients and/or suspects. At the Emergency and ICU, the facilities provided are supplemental oxygen, portable ventilators and standard critical care services. Patients will be assigned rooms based on the severity of symptoms. If and when required, more rooms/beds will be incorporated. In addition to this every patient and family member walking in is undergoing thermal screening and proper hand sanitization as a precautionary measure. AMRI has 21 isolation beds.RTIICS has five isolation beds fully equipped with ventilator support. “As we have many other critical patients, occupying the ICU at almost 100%, a balance has to be maintained to ensure these vulnerable patients are not exposed to the risk of Covid-19. We are stocking a few essential medicines and injections for a possible emergency situation,” said Venkatesh.Fortis Hospital is keeping a team of key doctors and nurses from all departments ready. They will join hands to work in emergency rooms and intensive care units in case of a crisis. Medica Superspecialty Hospital has earmarked 30 beds for Covid-19 patients. It is ready to create 100 more. “We have enough ventilators, medicines to deal with an emergency situation.

484,['22/03/2020'],‘Masks mandatory only for high-risk groups’,"Kolkata: The city has taken refuge behind masks of myriad shapes, colours and makes but the majority of them could actually lead to spread infection rather than check it, warned experts. While those who are forced to get in close proximity to the quarantined and suspected Covid-19 patients should be wearing an N95 mask that is believed to offer fool-proof protection, other kinds of masks should be discarded after 4-6 hours of use, they have pointed out.

Even as the supply of masks has been drying up with thousands scampering to get one, doctors and experts said that while it is advisable to don it, wearing a mask is not mandatory for all. Only those who must get close to the infected people or possible Covid-19 patients — namely doctors, nurses, hospital staff, caregivers and family members at home — need to wear one. But the high-risk group must stick to N95 or surgical masks purchased from a proper medical equipment store, they pointed out. For the rest, any mask should suffice, provided they are discarded everyday.

A mask serves two purposes — protecting you from infection and protecting those around you from a viral attack, said pulmonologist Raja Dhar. “If you are healthy then a mask should be used when you are travelling in public transport or visiting a place where a fairly large number of people are likely to gather. This mask could be anything, even a paper mask which covers your mouth and nose adequately,” said Dhar. But in case you are getting closer than six feet to a Covid-19 patient or one with symptoms, then an N95 mask or a surgical mask is compulsory, he added. “So, other than doctors, hospital staff or family members of the infected, the rest can use any mask,” Dhar felt.

An N-95 mask is likely to provide the best protection since it is designed to block 95% of the germs, pointed out RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) consultant Arindam Biswas . “In case you are suffering from a cold, a mask is a must even in home quarantine. The rest should also be using an N-95 if they are visiting a gathering or travelling in a public transport,” said Biswas. But for the rest, a surgical mask should be enough. But not a paper mask or a handkerchief. While papers are likely to get wet very quickly, handkerchiefs are kept on tables, desks and beds and are likely to spread infection,” said Biswas.

According to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, one is needed to wear a mask only if he/she is coughing or sneezing. If you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected 2019-nCoV infection. But for thousands of residents in the city, N-95 masks have become the latest fashion accessory.

“I had bought a set of six black N-95 masks back in the second week of February when the infection was just setting in our country. I and my wife wear one every day while going to work or even going out in the locality these days. Both of us are healthy but I don’t want to take a chance in contracting the disease from air. I don’t think I am committing a crime,” said Sumanta Chowdhury , who works at a Sector V firm.

Another Class-XII student said he and his friends have regularly been donning masks as “told by his parents” and also because it looks “cool”.

“My father had initially bought me two bland looking grey masks but I have bought two cool looking white and blue masks online. They look great as I have seen in some Hollywood sci fi movies,” said the teenager from Lake Gardens.

More on Covid-19

NEW DELHI: An unprecedented shutdown commenced across the country on Sunday morning on Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's appeal for a ' Janta curfew ' to help check the spread of coronavirus As the 'Janta curfew' got underway at 7 am, people largely kept themselves indoor as part of the social distancing exercise to stop the spread of the virus and bare number of public transport vehicles plied on nearly empty roads.All markets and establishments except those dealing in essential goods and services will be closed for the day. The 'Janta Curfew' will end at 9 pm.Ahead of the start of the curfew, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, ""In a few minutes from now, the #JantaCurfew commences. Let us all be a part of this curfew, which will add tremendous strength to the fight against COVID-19 menace"".He said the steps to be taken now will help in the times to come.""Stay indoors and stay healthy,"" he said on Twitter.In the national capital, the roads were deserted with barely some private vehicles and buses plying. Vendors were off the roads in the morning hours with people confining themselves to their homes.In Mumbai, the usually bustling western and eastern express highways and other arterial roads looked empty as people stayed in their homes to support the curfew.Same was the situation at the suburban train stations which normally see thousands of commuters jostling to get inside the overcrowded trains.Cutting across party lines, chief ministers and others leaders have urged the people to follow the self-imposed curfew, noting that ""social distancing"" was key to breaking the chain of transmission, as the number of coronavirus cases rose to 283 after 60 new cases were detected on Saturday, the highest so far in a day.States like Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan and Bihar have announced either complete or partial lockdown till month end.No passenger train will originate from any railway station in the country from midnight to 10 pm on Sunday while all suburban train services will be reduced to a bare minimum as well. Metro services, including in Delhi, Hyderabad and Mumbai, will remain suspended for the day.Air carriers like GoAir, IndiGo and Vistara have announced that they will be curtailing domestic operations on Sunday.Traders' body Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has announced that they will keep their establishments shut across the country for the 'Janta curfew'.From suspending regular prayers involving large gatherings in shrines of various faiths, including Sunday mass, to disallowing jail inmates from meeting their families on the day, organisations and institutions in every sphere have announced restrictions.Modi had on Thursday called for the 'Janta curfew' from 7 am to 9 pm on March 22, saying no citizen, barring those in essential services, should get out of their houses, and asserted that it will be a litmus test to show India's readiness to take on the coronavirus challenge.Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla has asked chief secretaries of all states to ensure that the 'Janta Curfew' is observed properly and to see that local bodies, fire services, police and civil defence blow sirens or ring bells on Sunday evening to express gratitude towards those involved in tackling the disease.""We are looking for unity in isolation,"" Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Health Lav Agarwal had said.Describing it as the need of the hour, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had asked everyone in the country to support the step.Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu had also made a fervent appeal to the people of the country to confine themselves to homes. He said that since the virus spreads through physical contact, social distancing is an effective measure to contain its spread by avoiding contact during the incubation period of the virus.""It is a matter of great assurance that people have responded very positively to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's appeal,"" Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Saturday.In Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had said that 50 per cent of the buses will ply on roads on Sunday considering some people may have to travel due to an emergency.Autos and taxis will, however, be off roads in the national capital as several unions including the Delhi Autorickshaw Sangh, Delhi Pradesh Taxi Union, Delhi Auto Taxi Transport Congress Union and Delhi Taxi Tourist Transport Association, have decided to join the 'Janta curfew'.Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had also appealed to the people of the state to stay indoors on Sunday.""Metro trains, roadways buses and city buses will not operate on Sunday,"" the statement said on behalf of the chief minister.""To curb this infection, we are working on a war footing. Isolation wards have been set up in every district hospital and medical college. So far, 23 patients have been identified in the state, out of which nine have completely recovered.
