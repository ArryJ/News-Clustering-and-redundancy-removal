This has, obviously, not gone down well with environmentalists and other like-minded citizens, who have now taken up the cause of the park with a Save Bannerghatta campaign. Speaking to us, environmentalist Vijay Nishanth says, “We are looking at drumming up public support to stop any change to the buffer zone. If the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) is reduced, there will be widespread quarrying, mining and development of residential layouts, all of which will further damage the forest. Bengaluru is already grappling with high levels of air, water, soil and noise pollution. The 268 sq kms around the Bannerghatta National Park protects its rich biodiversity and is a vital elephant corridor. Any attempt by the government to reduce the buffer zone will lead to increased man-animal conflict. Any decision to reduce ESZ will cause irreparable damage to the flora and fauna of Bannerghatta and affect oxygen supply to Bengaluru, which is already witnessing soaring temperatures.”Expressing anguish over the government's apathy in protecting the environment, Harish Kumar of the Namma Bengaluru Foundation adds, “Bannerghatta is the only natural forest in Bengaluru. Reducing the natural buffer zone also cuts down water streams that feed the river Cauvery, which, in turn, may leave taps running dry. The government should see the ground reality from the eyes of citizens and not through the eyes of some vested interests. The smaller ESZ will fragment and disintegrate BNP.

While Sathyasiva is helming the project, not many details regarding the cast were revealed, till now. We have now learnt from the director that Krishna and Mahima Nambiar are part of the film. Says Sathyasiva, “Since I found the film gripping, I decided to remake it in Tamil. It is set in the 1980s and its concept is quite different. Rishab Shetty had played the lead role in the Kannada movie. I decided to cast Krishna, as he looks a bit like him and would fit in the role of a ‘wannabe’ detective. He plays a cop, who takes up one of the biggest cases to investigate in order to establish him as a spy. But that investigation leads him to several other mysteries. Mahima plays the female lead and she has a powerful role. She plays someone who is involved in selling illegal liquor. Saravanan plays a pivotal role along with actor Shivamani, who was also part of the Kannada original.”The team has already finished the film’s shooting and the post-production work is going on. Having directed Krishna in Kazhugu and Kazhugu 2, Sathyasiva says that it was a breeze working with him in this film. “I have worked with him twice. So, it made sense to cast Krishna again for this film as I know his acting capabilities. It is always a pleasure to work with him,” says the director.The film’s music is by Sam CS. “We are planning to release the first look of the film by next week,” informs the director.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74426408,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-348104/74426408.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/bell-bottoms-tamil-remake-has-krishna-and-mahima/articleshow/74426408.cms

Actress Wafa Khatheeja Rahman , who played Dulquer Salmaan ’s girlfriend in Anoop Sathyan ’s Varane Avashyamund is happy that she could play a Beary girl in the multi-starrer and even say a few lines in the language, which is spoken in a certain areas of South Karnataka and North Kerala.Wafa, who is also a final year LLB student in Kochi, says, “Though there aren’t many from our community in media like films, I have been getting good support, and our people are going in huge bunches to watch the film. The fact that I am also speaking Beary in the movie, especially in the scene in which I get upset with Dulquer outside a movie theatre, has been exciting for everyone.”On the actress, who debuted with Shankar Ramakrishnan’s Pathinettam Padi, was roped in for Varane Avashyamund, she says, “I knew choreographer Sajna Najam personally since school days and she is the one who urged me to audition for Pathinettam Padi. I used to love music, dance and theatre and had no movie experience or plans, but she felt I would be right for this particular character in Pathinettam Padi, for which Shankar sir was looking for someone. After the movie was out, I happened to give a couple of interviews, in which I naturally said I am not a Malayali and is from Mangalore. Around that time, Anoop Sathyan was looking for a non-Malayali girl to play Dulquer’s girlfriend in his film, and his assistant Jithin noticed me.”The film’s shoot had already begun when she joined the team. Wafa, whose character is also named thus, says she loved the brief about her character who isn’t scared to leave behind a relationship to pursue her goal.So, who wrote the lines in Beary for the role? “Anoop used to give me a brief on the various situations, for which I used to form my own lines in Beary, rather than someone else writing it in another language and me translating it. My mom was also on the set, so we used to discuss and incorporate popular words used in Beary into my dialogues. Many scenes were shot with Beary in it, though all of them weren’t used in the movie,” the actress says.Wafa was recently featured in a Valentine’s Day special music video too, by Pathinettam Padi composer A H Kaashif.

6,['2/03/2020'],pearle maaney new show: My new chat show will evoke genuine laughter: Pearle Maaney,"When one thinks of anchor and actress Pearle Maaney , one of the first few things that come to mind is her chirpy and dynamic persona. The former host of D4 Dance , who was last seen on TV in Bigg Boss Malayalam’s first edition, is thrilled to be part of an upcoming show titled Funny Nights with Pearle that banks on what she does best —talk, make people laugh and entertain. Pearle, who is also awaiting her Bollywood debut —an Anurag Basu directorial, tells us what she has in store for the audience.I would only get to know more about it once we actually start shooting. All I can say is that it’s a chat show that will be full of fun. Though I have been getting a lot offers for chat shows, before and after my marriage, I never felt like taking them up, as it was all like something I have already done. I wanted to do something that would bring out the fun element in me. I liked how this show just fit the bill, and would get across audience of all age groups, which includes ammammas and kids, evoking genuine pottichiri.In today’s world, there are enough problems, and even social media is flooded by posts of such instances. There is never a ‘going away’ from all this, and yet I think you just have one life, and you can spend some time laughing and relaxing, without thinking about anything serious. The show resonates with my mantra that no matter what happens, you must always find a reason to smile.When the makers briefed me about the concept, I was like, ‘Wow, let’s do it’. I feel this is my home ground, and when it is a fun show, you feel like you are not working, you are enjoying.We don’t talk about anything other than what pertains to the house, like ‘Why hasn’t the plants been watered?’ (Laughs). We don’t discuss anything beyond that. That said, having shows in the same channel was never planned, but it feels great, as the team working with Srini would be teaming up with me as well. So, they will bond well with him and me.Srini had come to pick me up, as my car’s tyre got punctured that day. It was a coincidence that on the same day the director had asked me to shoot a promo video to put up on social media. That’s when Srini came, and whatever you see in the video was done on the spot and we got it right in a single take. I was having pazhampori at that time, and it so happened that the scene we shot had me throwing tantrums at him, who was asking what my show was on, and I playfully reply that my show is named on the snack itself.I am not following the show much, and I have only watched it in bits and pieces, through the cuts or promo videos. I also see people’s opinions and trolls. The day I posted about Rajith sir was after watching the show for two days, and I felt that he was getting physically hurt, in various instances. I am somebody, who has been inside the house, and I know how it feels. Claustrophobia is something grave, and only when you get stuck in a lift, you actually get to understand the fear. And, when you are stuck, if someone shows you a knife, even if he or she has no intention to hurt, that can be horrifying.It is the same feeling when you are in Bigg Boss, and no one from the outside can understand what it is to get stuck inside the house. In such a situation, never entertain physical violence. I was disturbed to see this, and even if somebody else was in his place, I would say the same. I cannot tolerate somebody getting hurt on the show, and no matter what, you can’t touch or hurt someone. You cannot justify that. You can shout, but the minute you touch a person, you cross the limit.With regard to personal favourites, I can’t pick one, but a person would only like someone who matches his or her character. The person who wins will reflect which side the outside world is on— good or bad. That will show the inclination of majority of the audience. I don’t want to confuse people by picking up one. I like all of them. Some of them are my friends too.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74425431,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-65372/74425431.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/malayalam/my-new-chat-show-will-evoke-genuine-laughter-pearle-maaney/articleshow/74425431.cms
7,['2/03/2020'],"Abandoned by families, many large dogs struggle in shelter homes in Bengaluru","Once living happily with his pet owners, five-year-old Rottweiler Sam has been having a tough time at a dog shelter in Kengeri. Sam, as it turns out, was abandoned by his former pet parents, as they realised the difficulties of keeping a big dog in a family with children a tad too late. Instead of attempting to find Sam a loving new home, they did the easiest thing — got rid of him at a city shelter for rescued and abandoned animals. Sadly, he is not the only one who has been at the receiving end of such behaviour from a pet parent.Since 2013, Compassion Unlimited Plus Action — CUPA has rescued 1,358 dogs of all sizes, many of which are larger breeds.“Back in 2013, the kind of dogs that we had available for adoption were mainly Labradors, Spitzes, Golden Retrievers, Cocker Spaniels and mixed breeds. But from 2016 onwards, we saw an explosion of large breed dogs being given up and abandoned. We have had 122 Rottweilers being given up for adoption,” says Sanjana Madappa, adoption coordinator at CUPA. Animal welfare worker Chinthana Gopinath adds, “Pet owners do not factor in the expenses that are involved when they buy pedigree puppies. As the pet grows bigger and older, the costs also go up — be it medical, food and maintenance —and it becomes a problem for many.”As if being abandoned is not bad enough, the trouble is that it is not easy for larger breeds to find a second home. “Large breed dogs are not easily adopted because people have misconceptions that they may be aggressive by nature. It can’t be further from the truth. These dogs, if treated well, and if living with people who know how to handle them, adjust as easily as any other breed. Any dog is only as good or bad as its owner,” states Sanjana.The reasons for the increase are also because of inadequate implementation of the breeding regulations. “The lack of implementation makes breeds like St Bernard’s, Alaskan and Siberian Huskies, Akitas, Pitbulls and others, easily accessible to people who are not equipped to deal with the requirements of these breeds. People buy them thinking they are cute as pups, but don’t take into account that they will grow into large dogs that need a certain kind of upbringing. Also, they are expensive to maintain. Most of the time, these dogs land up at our doorsteps as young adults, because they become difficult to manage,” quips Sanjana.“A lot of pet owners get carried away with the trend and we have noticed that whichever dog is trending for some time, are the ones that get abandoned the most. We had noticed a lot of pitbull abandonment cases at one point, as there was a trend and once that went off and costs came in the picture they were abandoned. People tend to buy a breed that is trending and fashionable, and those end up in the abandonment circle,” Chinthana signs off.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74425480,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1744918/74425480.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/relationships/pets/abandoned-by-families-many-large-dogs-struggle-in-shelter-homes/articleshow/74425480.cms

11,['2/03/2020'],League Cup: Manchester City beat Aston Villa to win third straight League Cup,"Getty Images

LONDON: Manchester City claimed the League Cup for the fourth time in five seasons by beating Aston Villa 2-1 at Wembley on Sunday thanks to goals from Sergio Aguero and Rodrigo.

Mbwana Samatta pulled a goal back for Villa, but their wait for the club's first silverware since 1996 goes on as Pep Guardiola's men have now won six of the last seven major trophies in English football .

Guardiola made eight changes from the side that won 2-1 at Real Madrid in the Champions League on Wednesday with Kevin De Bruyne among those left on the bench.

However, it mattered little as City had the luxury of recalling Aguero, Raheem Sterling and David Silva to the starting XI, and the gulf in class showed.

Guardiola's raft of changes also handed a rare start to Phil Foden and the 19-year-old more than justified his selection.

Rodrigo's fine pass picked out Foden to head back into the path of Aguero and the Argentine's deflected effort beat Orjan Nyland in the Villa goal to open the scoring on 20 minutes.

Foden was then inches away from a goal himself with a deflected shot that flew inches wide.

Villa felt aggrieved when City were awarded another corner moments later after Jack Grealish fired the ball off Ilkay Gundogan for what should have been a goal kick.

Instead, City doubled their lead as Gundogan's corner was met with a powerful downward header from Rodrigo.

Villa could barely even get a touch for the next 10 minutes as the holders threatened to run riot in a repeat of the 6-1 thrashing they handed the hosts at Villa Park last month.

Sterling had a glorious chance for his first goal of 2020 deflected behind by a brave block from Tyrone Mings.

But moments later the reason Mings is ahead of John Stones in the pecking order for England selection became clear as the City defender inexplicably fell to the floor to give Villa a lifeline.

A long ball forward eventually came to Anwar El Ghazi and from his cross Samatta headed low past Claudio Bravo to the delight of the travelling thousands from Birmingham and Villa fan Prince William in the stands.

The difference in the desperation for success between the supports was obvious as Villa were roared on vociferously throughout, while City failed to sell out their allocation.

That did not compensate for the difference in quality on the field as City quickly settled back into their rhythm and could then introduce De Bruyne for the final half hour.

However, City failed to turn their dominance into more goals as Rodrigo was denied by a fine save by Nyland from another corner before Aguero then fired into the side-netting to give Villa hope for the last 10 minutes.

And they were very nearly punished as the often-criticised Bravo had to make a brilliant save three minutes from time to turn Bjorn Engels' header onto the post and maintain City's grip on the competition.

The rise in the number of coronavirus incidents globally has led to rescheduling, rerouting and cancellations by honeymooners as they are dropping their preferred holiday destinations from their itinerary. If you’re looking for holiday destinations after you had to cancel your trip due to the outbreak, be quick, because places like the Maldives and Mauritius are being booked aplenty.Tour operators selling packages for European countries are observing a shift to other destinations. Vipul Prakash, COO, MakeMyTrip, says, “Amid travel restrictions levied by countries due to the coronavirus scare, we are witnessing a shift in travel preferences among honeymooners. Overseas, Bali and the Maldives remain popular choices, with Bali witnessing a 40% year-on-year growth and the Maldives seeing a 33% year-on-year growth. Other countries considered by honeymooners in general include South Africa and Greece .”Priyanka, who works for a travel agency in Malviya Nagar, says, “Around 70%-80% bookings by honeymooners in the next three months have been for the Maldives and Mauritius. We are getting lots of queries regardless of the destination – should I cancel my trip? Which parts of the world can guarantee no coronavirus outbreak? Are there chances that we will be infected on an airplane? – so, we’re training our staff to be prepared with their replies. We had several bookings for Greece, but after the outbreak of coronavirus in the country, people are wondering whether they should cancel their plan or simply reschedule. Now, we’re not suggesting Greece as an option to honeymooners.”Travel operators tell us that even for April-May, reservations are being made for countries with no reported coronavirus cases. Bittoo Bagga, who works for a designer in Connaught Place, says, “Famous honeymoon hotspots like Venice are not safe now. I wanted to reschedule our honeymoon from April to December because we wanted to go to Europe. I thought we can go when the situation is under control. But then I settled for the Maldives because of family pressure.”Tour operators say they are constantly checking advisories and updates for changes. Daniel D’souza, President and Country Head, Leisure, SOTC Travel, says that among honeymooning couples, there has been a rise in the popularity of tropical destinations like Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and Mauritius. He says, “We are monitoring developments and are in touch with tourism representatives, airlines, and on-ground associates to keep our customers updated. Keeping in mind their safety, we are recommending alternate destinations such as Russia, Switzerland , Jordan, Egypt , Turkey, South Africa, Tanzania , Sri Lanka, and Seychelles to honeymooners.”Tour operators have confirmed that they have received 100% cancellations for Thailand and Singapore, which are otherwise preferred honeymoon destinations among Indians. A tour operator informs, “We have received 100% cancellations for Thailand and Singapore. Also, European countries generally top the list of honeymooners but due to the coronavirus outbreak, we haven’t received new bookings for European countries. Those who already booked their trips are either rescheduling or opting for other destinations as the trips are expensive and cancellations would cost them a lot in no-refund cases.”Couples who are cancelling their overseas plans are opting for Indian destinations like Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Vipul Prakash, COO, MakeMyTrip, tells us, “Many honeymooners are choosing to travel domestically instead of going abroad. Within India, couples are opting for a romantic luxury holiday to explore Andamans, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan.”Smita Asthana, a merchandise shopper in Gurgaon, says, “We have booked a trip to the Andamans for March-end because we don’t want to splurge and regret by booking a foreign trip. Sadly, we won’t be able to boast about a Roman honeymoon. We can still go to affected the countries that have not banned travel or where no lockdown has been imposed but who wants to feel like a zombie on their honeymoon?

Although Okan’s two leading band members could not make it for their Indian tour this time, the band’s performance was the highlight of the event. Nevertheless, the other two band members took over the stage with Julio and gave an impressive performance. “We had to do last minute changes as two members of the band could not come. But the good thing about jazz is that it is set up in such a way that musicians can have a shared experience and a shared foundation. Without having ever worked together, it is possible for musicians to just meet on stage (as we did with Julio) and put a performance together quickly. We did the same and it sounded like we have been playing together,” said Jeremy Ledbetter , the pianist from Okan, adding, “I’d like to come back to understand music.

The session, conducted by Neela Kaushik , founder, GurgaonMoms, was about the actress' journey from playing the feisty journalist in ' Shanti ' to her stint as a cricket presenter and now a 'fitness influencer'. ""I don’t know how I became a fitness influencer. Every day, I just share a picture of a video. It keeps me honest. If that motivates even one person along the way, I am fine with that,"" Mandira said at the event.The session started with Neela Kaushik asking Mandira about her life before she became a household name by the means of her TV show 'Shanti'. ""I realised very early in my life that I wanted to do something creative. So, I did my post-graduation in Social Communication Media. Then I was interning with Prahlad Kakkar Adi Pocha , who is the director, writer and creator of Shanti, was getting one of his ads made by Prahlad. He told me that they were looking for an actor to play the role of Shanti. It was totally out of my comfort zone but I still went for that audition,"" she said. Talking about auditioning for the show, she added, ""They had told me to come wearing a business suit. That time I did not own a business suit so I went wearing a pair of jeans and white shirt. They called me for a second audition. Again, I was not wearing a business suit. Third time, I went wearing my lucky salwar-kameez. Depending on my mood, I would wear this bindi that I used to draw with liquid eyeliner. It was an arrow pointing downwards and when Adi saw me, he was like, 'Oh my god! What was I thinking, how could it have been a business suit? This is Shanti'. It all worked out well. I look back at it as an acting school. People lived vicariously through my character, they would get very involved and that was very special for me.""Neela Kaushik, founder, GurgaonMomsTalking about her stint as a presenter in cricket, Mandira shared, ""I just went there thinking I want to be accepted. But it was quite the opposite. For me, it was like people are not just passionate about cricket but they think of it as their religion. I was worried about being liked and accepted."" She added, ""Another thing was when you are going live in front of the camera, words once uttered can’t be taken back. So if you make a mistake, it is all there. That was a very difficult first week for me. I would cry after every segment and all the other commentators would be like, 'I am going to get a cup of coffee' because they did not want to deal with that. I would think that if I didn’t quit, I’d get kicked out.""But Mandira admits that it was just her self-doubt getting to her. She said, ""The channel’s representatives sat me down and said, 'We have auditioned about 1,000 girls, we know what you have and you are going to stay so you might as well start enjoying yourself. You are a presenter so start enjoying yourself'"". She further said that eventually she started coming into her own and got comfortable with the job. ""As they say, heaven and hell is in your head and honestly, I was in hell for the first week because I had so much going on.

22,['2/03/2020'],"Akshay Kumar: In Sooryavanshi, I’ve done the kind of stunts I would do in my late 20s","With Rohit Shetty ’s Sooryavanshi Akshay Kumar is back into the hardcore action zone. A space that is close to his heart and one that he can never completely leave behind. He says, “I’m glad that I could do it all over again at 52, with the same focus and agility”. Today, as the trailer of the film unveils, the actor speaks to BT about his deep respect for our men in uniform, how his family and foundation has helped shape his career and what drove him to return to his roots — high-octane action, blended with a story that is relevant to today’s times. Excerpts...I think I am fortunate that I lucked out with just 30 per cent hard work. I’m grateful for everything destiny and this industry have given me.Yaar, bandar kitna bhi buddha ho jaaye, gulatiyan maarna nahi bhoolta, aur na hi chhodta hai. Woh kalabaaziyan toh karega hi na (laughs!). Honestly, I enjoy performing stunts and it makes me happy to be able to pull it off without the use of computer graphics. When you see the trailer today, you will realise that I’ve performed the kind of stunts that I used to do when I was in my late 20s and early 30s. I’ve used the techniques that I had learnt early on in my life. For instance, we have performed a chopper stunt, which I had first attempted when I was 28 years old. I’m glad that I could do it all over again at 52, with the same focus and agility. I’ve often heard the audience complain about the quality of VFX in action scenes and so, Rohit and I ensured that we don’t use VFX in at least 90 per cent of action sequences. However, I’ve realised that it’s safer to do stunts now. Rohit and his team are extremely vigilant and careful. They had worked out every scene in detail, including the action sequences.All my films are important to me. In fact, my flops are dearer and more important for me because they caution me to take a step back and analyse what went wrong. I remember, there was a time when I saw 14 flops in a row. When I was working on the 14th film, I thought yeh to chal jayegi, lekin nahi chali. And then, when I thought yeh 15th film ka pata nahi kya hoga, it worked. It ended my spell of flops. So, it’s difficult to say what works and what doesn’t. My experiences have taught me that the result of a film is never in your hands. You just have to keep faith in whatever you do and give it your best. That is all that I do, and that is what I have done with Sooryavanshi, too.I have a special kind of love and reverence for uniforms because my father was in the army and I had always seen him wear his uniform, proudly. In the case of Sooryavanshi, I got a chance to revisit that space of a hardcore commercial action film. It gave me that sense of déjà vu, as I performed the kind of action that I did years ago. There’s no one better than Rohit Shetty for this. And, when he narrated the subject of this film to me, I was more than happy to become a part of his cop universe. It’s a successful, home-grown universe of heroic police officers.There’s a world of difference. Of course, it was fun working with her because we’ve worked together on many films in the past. She has a considerable part to play in Sooryavanshi. It has been wonderful to see her growth as an actor. Her command of Hindi has improved manifold. I remember there was a crucial scene in the film, which was intense and high on emotions. She handled it well and there are quite a few scenes, which make you realise that she has come into her own as an actor. She has shown that she is more than someone who is good-looking and a great dancer.Every uniform — whether it’s of the police or the defence forces — is worn by someone, who can have a negative side or positive side. If some films in the past have shown cops with shades of grey, it’s only to say that being like that does not help. Being corrupt or doing things that are against your duty does not pay you dividends. In its own way, a film like Khakee showed the daring side of the policemen. Rohit took it a few notches higher and turned it into a series of commercial films about a saviour or heroic rakshak in a police uniform. He created a larger-than-life image of the police, which I think is commendable because these men in khaki are not as large in numbers as the aam junta, but they give their all to ensure that the city breathes in peace.Being scared is the first step towards doing things right. There’s good fear and bad fear in all of us. Good fear makes you cautious and helps you measure everything before you set out to do it. I have a lot of fear in me, but it’s the good fear, which makes me think things through before I start off. Of course, a wrong decision can take your career downhill. You can’t avert accidents like these completely, but some caution can reduce its impact. Today, as an actor, I don’t want to repeat myself. Even if I revisit a genre, it should be after a considerable gap. Also, the reason I don’t feel insecure and inhibited about anything, is my family. The foundation of this was laid during my childhood. Jab paise kum the, hum tab bhi khush the, aaj paise hain tab bhi utne hi khush hain. Main kya leke aaya tha iss industry mein jisko khone ki chinta karun!Too many times. In this industry, there are surprises all the time. There are times when you’ve thought that something will work, it doesn’t and strangely, something you did not bank on, works. There’s nothing that you can be too sure of in your life. You can only be sure of being a professional, doing your job and not hurting people with your words. In simple terms, mind your own business. Remembering your basics and staying connected with your roots is way cooler than forgetting them. People find it amusing that I sleep and wake up early. When people question me about it, I find that funny. When people joke about the work I pull off in a year, I feel like telling them that you can do it too, but you chose not to.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74426755,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-78439/74426755.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/akshay-kumar-in-sooryavanshi-ive-done-the-kind-of-stunts-i-would-do-in-my-late-20s/articleshow/74426766.cms

24,['2/03/2020'],Sayantani Ghosh: As a kid I looked forward to going to Appu Ghar during my Delhi trips,"Starring in two daily shows as well as hosting a sports show leaves Sayantani Ghosh little time for herself. Travelling, which she loves, suffers the most. ""I don't have time for that,"" she tells us when we catch up with her on her short trip to Delhi. Like most of her Delhi trips, this too, has been for work but the ' Sanjivani 2 actress does sneak in some time for shopping at Dilli Haat in Pitampura. She says, ""I am happy the weather wasn't too cold because I don't do well in the cold. I had come for some work but managed to get some time off in between to have a quick view of Delhi. That’s how most of my Delhi trips are. Though I really wish that I could take a longer break and hang around here longer.""Sayantani's association with Delhi dates back to when she hadn't even entered the TV industry. Recalling her childhood memories in Delhi, she says, ""I remember going to Appu Ghar. It had all those rides and I would really look forward to coming to Delhi because I wanted to go there. In Mumbai, these theme parks came up much later."" But even after coming to Delhi several times over such a long time, she hasn’t been able to cross one thing off her bucket list – shopping at Janpath. She elaborates, ""Years ago, I had cleared NIFT and I had come here for my results. I was in GK then and I really liked the vibe there. Each time I come here, I plan to go to Janpath but it never happens. Janpath is jinxed for me. I hope next time I can get the chance to go there.""Sayantani says there is competition in TV now than when she started 14 years agoHaving been a part of the industry for 14 years, Sayantani has seen it grow and evolve. She started her journey with 'Kumkum' and ' Comedy Circus ' and is still active with shows like 'Sanjivani 2' and ' Naagin 4'. The biggest change she has seen is increased competition. ""There is a whole lot of competition now. There are so many channels. When I started, competition was still there but now there is so much work that every day there are new people coming in. So it’s really challenging to stay relevant,"" she tells us.TV might have evolved over the years in terms of competition but several concepts have remained evergreen. For instance, Sayantani is currently starring in 'Naagin 4' and she was also part of the first season of the show, all the way back in 2008. ""Shows like 'Naagin' have these concepts that are deeply rooted in the Indian upbringing, especially mythology,"" Sayantani explains. ""That’s why shows like Mahabharata and Ramayana click more often than not on Indian television. Fantasy-based shows work. I did 'Naagin' back in 2008 and I’m doing Naagin again in 2020. So yes, while there has been a lot of development in terms of entertainment and the audience has evolved, such concepts will always resonate with the Indian audience,"" she adds.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74426715,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-167056/74426715.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/sayantani-ghosh-as-a-kid-i-looked-forward-to-going-to-appu-ghar-during-my-delhi-trips/articleshow/74426693.cms

PANAJI: As a child, Anish Kumar remembers how rowdies from his locality constantly invaded his house and robbed money from his parents. Struggling to make ends meet themselves, there seemed to be no way out for his parents in Neelasandra, a residential area in Bengaluru which is inhabited by migrants.

Dotted with four huge slums, most of the youth at Neelasandra are school dropouts. They take to crime and alcoholism, but Anish had a different obsession -- football. The 19-year-old is quite good at the game and believes it’s only a matter of time before he realises his dream of making it to the Indian team.

From the slums of Neelasandra to the Indian team would be quite a story, and it all begins at the SPN National Inclusion Cup at Miramar for Anish.

The National Inclusion Cup, organised by the Nagpur-based Slum Soccer, is a one of its kind event that brings together children from slums across the country and those underprivileged, trying to change their lives through football.

“Life is a constant struggle back home. With football, things can get better. It’s so different here. We get proper food, clean water to drink and a place to stay. I just want to do the best I can,” said Anish, who cycles 3km everyday to fetch water from a tap.

Anish is not alone. The National Inclusion Cup, now in its 17th edition and started by professor Vijay Barse, a retired sports teacher from Nagpur, has attracted 50 teams and over 500 players, all battling for a place in the Indian team for the Homeless World Cup in Finland later this year. While Anish has moved out of Bengaluru for the first time – apart from a football trip to Mysuru – and made the overnight bus journey to Goa, Junaid Ahmed Laway had to endure five days of travel just to get here.

“I can see that the journey has been worth it. Life can be an adventure and I want to see the world outside Kashmir,” said Junaid, a 21-year old who is dreaming of catching the selectors’ eye and seeing the world in all its glory.

Hailing from Pampore, famous as Kashmir’s ‘ Saffron Town’ for its precious high-grade spice, Junaid has heard of a “beautiful world,” but doesn’t really know what it looks like beyond his neighbourhood. On a small ground, he’s seen children of his age kick the ball around and it’s this beautiful sport that can now become his passport to the world.

Kashmir has done well here, winning four of their five games, losing only to Meghalaya in penalties, with Junaid among the goals.

Kajal Shiriange has a different goal. Having lost her father a decade ago, the 21-year-old girl from Gondia district in Maharashtra has seen her mother struggle all her life, sweeping floors at railway stations and godowns, so that they don’t go to bed hungry.

“I want to help my mother. I know if I become a good footballer, I can possibly get a government job and then ease the burden which my mother has been carrying all her life,” said Kajal.

Life has been tough, and cruel, for the Shirianges, who don’t have a house which they can call their own and live with their supportive grandmother.

“When this tournament ends, not just me but all of us will be in tears. We’ve never seen anything like this before,” said Shiriange, raving about the bread and jam she was fortunate to have for breakfast on Sunday morning.

Nobody has had it easy here. At Miramar, the goals for India’s underprivileged are not quite the same.

Canadian High Commissioner Nadir Patel hosted a lunch for his friends and colleagues at his residence on Thursday. On the balmy, spring afternoon, the lawns of Patel’s residence were all decked up in tones of green, yellow and pink. The stage was set for a jazz performance as the fragrance of marigold and rose welcomed the guests.The High Commissioner was accompanied by his one-year-old son Aydin. “This is Aydin’s first official event, so he is going to help me out little bit. He just turned one,” said the High Commissioner as he introduced Aydin to guests. He added that the idea of the event was to “have a fun, informal afternoon and to thank everyone for being ambassadors for Canada-India relationships in different ways.”Julio FalavingaRoberto RiveronJazz performance by the members of Canadian jazz band Okan and Brazilian musician Julio Falavinga kept the guests entertained. Although Okan’s two leading band members could not make it for their Indian tour this time, the band’s performance was the highlight of the event. Nevertheless, the other two band members took over the stage with Julio and gave an impressive performance. “We had to do last minute changes as two members of the band could not come. But the good thing about jazz is that it is set up in such a way that musicians can have a shared experience and a shared foundation. Without having ever worked together, it is possible for musicians to just meet on stage (as we did with Julio) and put a performance together quickly. We did the same and it sounded like we have been playing together,” said Jeremy Ledbetter , the pianist from Okan, adding, “I’d like to come back to understand music. Indian music is one of the most culturally rich music.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74427267,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-79411,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-jazzed-up-lunch-hosted-by-canadian-high-commissioner-in-delhi/articleshow/74427324.cms
27,['2/03/2020'],Mandira Bedi: Started as a presenter in cricket because I wanted to be accepted,"'People got really involved with my character in 'Shanti''

Neela Kaushik, founder, GurgaonMoms

'Everything changed after I started enjoying myself'

Recently, GurgaonMoms organised a special interactive session with actress and fitness enthusiast Mandira Bedi at a city hotel. The session, conducted by Neela Kaushik , founder, GurgaonMoms, was about the actress' journey from playing the feisty journalist in ' Shanti ' to her stint as a cricket presenter and now a 'fitness influencer'. ""I don’t know how I became a fitness influencer. Every day, I just share a picture of a video. It keeps me honest. If that motivates even one person along the way, I am fine with that,"" Mandira said at the event.The session started with Neela Kaushik asking Mandira about her life before she became a household name by the means of her TV show 'Shanti'. ""I realised very early in my life that I wanted to do something creative. So, I did my post-graduation in Social Communication Media. Then I was interning with Prahlad Kakkar . Adi Pocha , who is the director, writer and creator of Shanti, was getting one of his ads made by Prahlad. He told me that they were looking for an actor to play the role of Shanti. It was totally out of my comfort zone but I still went for that audition,"" she said. Talking about auditioning for the show, she added, ""They had told me to come wearing a business suit. That time I did not own a business suit so I went wearing a pair of jeans and white shirt. They called me for a second audition. Again, I was not wearing a business suit. Third time, I went wearing my lucky salwar-kameez. Depending on my mood, I would wear this bindi that I used to draw with liquid eyeliner. It was an arrow pointing downwards and when Adi saw me, he was like, 'Oh my god! What was I thinking, how could it have been a business suit? This is Shanti'. It all worked out well. I look back at it as an acting school. People lived vicariously through my character, they would get very involved and that was very special for me.""Neela Kaushik, founder, GurgaonMomsTalking about her stint as a presenter in cricket, Mandira shared, ""I just went there thinking I want to be accepted. But it was quite the opposite. For me, it was like people are not just passionate about cricket but they think of it as their religion. I was worried about being liked and accepted."" She added, ""Another thing was when you are going live in front of the camera, words once uttered can’t be taken back. So if you make a mistake, it is all there. That was a very difficult first week for me. I would cry after every segment and all the other commentators would be like, 'I am going to get a cup of coffee' because they did not want to deal with that. I would think that if I didn’t quit, I’d get kicked out.""But Mandira admits that it was just her self-doubt getting to her. She said, ""The channel’s representatives sat me down and said, 'We have auditioned about 1,000 girls, we know what you have and you are going to stay so you might as well start enjoying yourself. You are a presenter so start enjoying yourself'"". She further said that eventually she started coming into her own and got comfortable with the job. ""As they say, heaven and hell is in your head and honestly, I was in hell for the first week because I had so much going on. The moment I switched that off, I started enjoying myself and everything changed after that. At the end of those six weeks, people got to know me as Mandira Bedi and not through the characters I had played till then,"" she added.",gurgaon,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74426896,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-112052,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/mandira-bedi-started-as-a-presenter-in-cricket-because-i-wanted-to-be-accepted/articleshow/74426939.cms
28,['2/03/2020'],Embracing fifty shades of grey,"Platinum greys are all over Instagram, grabbing eyeballs, making a style statement and turning its nose up to eons of ageism faced by women. For men, back home, actors like Akshay Kumar, Hrithik Roshan and model Milind Soman have been the torchbearers of sorts, sporting the salt-and-pepper look with élan. It was rare to see male celebs go grey in public, but these actors have changed that perspective. And now women are following suit, proudly flaunting their greys.Thirty-eight-year-old Veena Edwankar, an admin personnel, who started greying at the age of 16, shares, “In my teens, I tried everything to cover up my greys including henna, dye, hair treatments and beetroot extract. Since my husband is into hairstyling and make-up, after marriage he used to colour my hair. He eventually stopped, and that was when I decided to go grey. It took me over a year to grow my hair to shoulder length. People would taunt me about how bad it looks. I began to question this notion that grey hair means you are old. It’s been two years since I have not dyed my hair, and I feel that everything looks grey and beautiful when you accept your natural self.”For Dimple Rathore, a homemaker staying away from colouring her locks was an easy decision, thanks to her husband, who has gone grey with her, and says it’s more cost effective. Thirty-four-year-old Roocha Yagnik, an ad filmmaker, who has patches of grey in her hair, makes a case for not labelling people. She says, “Men are referred to as silver foxes when they go grey, while women get labelled old. I don’t agree with that, and chose not to colour my hair as I don’t want to be boxed into these categories. My family is concerned about my marriage prospects and keep asking me to dye my hair as they feel I look older than my age. However, I have no such reservations as I want the man in my life to accept me the way I am with my greys.”And if you think life is hard for mere mortals, it’s far worse for celebs. Take the case of Alexandra Grant a visual artist, philanthropist, and author. She came into the global spotlight because of her relationship status as actor Keanu Reeves’ girlfriend. She described how in her 30s, she let her hair turn “blonde” and prevailing beauty standards shouldn’t dictate how women choose to look.While Alexandra chose to wear her natural grey locks, celebs like singer Ariana Grande and singer Lady Gaga have been sporting it all of last year as a ‘trendy look’. Ultimately, whether you choose to dye your hair or simply go grey. It should be your choice and there should be no compulsion to fit into a type or a be judged as per set beauty standards.While many feel highlights and global hair gives you a younger appearance, Priya Gomatam, a homemaker feels otherwise. She says, “I am a strong advocate for sporting greys. I know how hard it was for my friends (who were greying) to give up colouring their hair. I chose not to go down that route. Besides, the hair colour only lasts for a while. Once it starts to fade, it looks bad unless touched up. People may also think that colouring their hair makes them look younger, however, when the colour starts fading and the greys start showing, I feel it looks much worse than simply wearing your natural grey hair.”Actor Neha Dhupia has a lock of grey hair since birth. She flaunts it with pride and shares, “It’s my lucky charm.” The actor is extremely particular about it and is known to never dye the same.When it comes to studying grey hair most researchers refer to the validity of the 50/50/50 rule of thumb, which states that ‘at age 50 years, 50 per cent of the population has at least 50 per cent grey hair’. According to some historical accounts Marie Antoinette’s hair suddenly turned white before the ill-fated French queen was taken to the guillotine to have her head chopped off, and now a recent study by Harvard University scientists indicates premature greying can be caused by extreme stress.As per a global survey in 2012 published in the British Journal of Dermatology, between 45 and 65 years of age, 74 per cent of people were affected by grey hair. Men significantly had more grey hair than women. The rate of greying with age appeared to be clearly linked to ethnic/geographical origin.Recently a study found a correlation between dyes and a risk of breast cancer. According to the findings of a study published in the International Journal of Cancer, (based on data from 46,709 women ), women who used permanent hair dye or straighteners, or applied straighteners, had a higher risk of developing breast cancer than women who didn’t. The results suggest using hair dye and straightener “could play a role in breast carcinogenesis,” the study noted. However, this study is not conclusive and needs further investigation.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74427078,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-109923/74427078.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/beauty/embracing-fifty-shades-of-grey/articleshow/74426130.cms

KOZHIKODE: Pope Francis has dismissed Robin Vadakkumchery , the Kerala vicar who was last year convicted of raping and impregnating a minor girl and jailed for 20 years, from priesthood.

""From now on, he won’t have any priestly rights and duties. He will be known as Robin Vadakkumchery,"" Fr Jose Kocharakkal , official spokesperson for the Catholic diocese of Mananthavady , said on Sunday. Kocharakkal said Pope Francis expelled Vadakkumchery from the clergy on the basis of a report submitted by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in Rome on December 5. He had been convicted and sentenced by the Thalassery Protection of Children from Sexual Offences court in February 2019.

Vadakkumchery was the vicar of St Sebastian Church at Neendunoki, in Kannur district. The dismissal of a priest of the Catholic Church from the clerical state is a permanent measure reserved for the most serious offences. Only the Pope has the power to do so.

The Catholic diocese of Mananthavady had suspended Vadakkumchery from priestly duties on February 27, 2017, after an anonymous call to the Childline in Kannur. The caller said a minor girl had delivered a baby at a hospital run by the church, and that the child was immediately shifted to Holy Infant Mary’s Foundling Home at Vythiri in Wayanad. Vadakkumchery was arrested on February 28 from the Kochi airport while trying to flee to Canada. He is serving his sentence at Kannur central jail.

32,['2/03/2020'],Foreign secretary in Bangladesh with CAA balm,"Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla (File photo)

NEW DELHI: When foreign secretary Harsh Shringla arrives in Dhaka on Monday, his primary task will be to assuage some serious hurt feelings among Bangladeshis over both the CAA-NRC controversy as well as some ill-judged comments by Indian politicians. Shringla will be the first high-level contact with the Sheikh Hasina government since protests against CAA-NRC erupted all across India.

PM Narendra Modi will be travelling to Dhaka on March 17 for a day to participate in the centenary celebration of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rehman. But he is likely to face some degree of wariness in a country which was touted as India’s closest neighbour not too long ago. In the past few days, Bangladesh even saw protest marches against communal riots that tore through Delhi last week.

Therefore, Modi is likely to face a different reception, even if the brass papers over the disquiet. The PM will deliver the keynote address at the Mujib centenary event, which will be attended by former President Pranab Mukherjee and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.

In the past few months, India has not really stretched itself diplomatically to reassure the people and the Bangladesh brass — particularly on the fear that migrants may be pushed into that country — already straining under the weight of the Rohingya refugees. Sources in Dhaka have been critical of the lack of initiative by the Indian government, particularly the foreign office here and the Indian mission in Dhaka.

Shringla is expected to call on PM Sheikh Hasina, foreign minister A K Abdul Momen and foreign secretary Masud bin Momen. He will also address a seminar organised by the Bangladesh Institute of Strategic Studies .

India wants a trade and services pact with Bangladesh, for which negotiations are expected to begin soon. India will also try to persuade Bangladesh to utilise the $500 million defence cooperation assistance that has been advanced to Dhaka but not made use of yet. More connectivity projects are likely to be announced and some, like rail services connecting Dhaka, Kolkata and Khulna, may increase their frequency.

Both Shringla and the PM are likely to engage the Bangladesh leadership on the Rohingya issue. It’s a thorny subject between two of India’s close neighbours. This week, the issue featured in high level talks during the state visit of Myanmar President U Win Myint here.

36,['2/03/2020'],‘Crush’ Narendra Modi government: IS-linked media group,"PM Narendra Modi (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Last week’s communal riots in Delhi have found mention in an article published by an Islamic State-aligned media group, Al Talaal Media, on Telegram, with the author alleging that Muslims of India were being “misguided” and fed with “poison of nationalism”. The article called upon Muslims of India to “crush” the Narendra Modi government and join the Islamic State .

According to an update on SITE News Intelligence Group’s website, the English-language article published by Al Talaal Media on February 26, 2020, seeks to cater to an audience in the Indian sub-continent and describes the historical and recent “oppression” faced by Muslims in India. The author claims that Muslims of India have been “misguided” and were fed with the “poison of nationalism”, citing the 2002 communal riots in Gujarat, the recent “massacre” of Muslims in Uttar Pradesh and current “oppression of Muslims in Delhi” as examples.

The article concludes with a call to Muslims in India to “join the caravan of Islamic State, protect the deen, and establish Caliphate inshallah,” and asks for protection from the “harsh conditions” and to “crush the fascist government of Modi.”

Delhi witnessed communal riots on February 24 and 25 in parts of northeast district. The violence followed in the wake of continuing protests by a section of Muslims against the Citizenship Amendment Act.

Islamic State-linked groups now seem to be taking an interest in the Delhi violence in what intelligence sources said could be a bid to exploit the negative sentiment to radicalise and influence Indian Muslims to join its ranks.

A graphic published on February 27, 2020, attributed to al-Qitaal Media Center, had featured an image of a Muslim man being beaten up by a mob during the recent Delhi violence, with the Quranic verse: “Permission (To Fight) has been given to those who are being fought, because they were wronged. And indeed, Allah is competent to give them victory. (They are) those who have been evicted from their homes without right – only because they say ‘Our Lord is Allah’.”

NEW DELHI: Days after large-scale riots in northeast Delhi, the capital was again put on edge on Sunday evening as rumours spread rapidly about “violence” in different parts of the city. Such was the impact of the rumours that Delhi Metro shut seven stations briefly as a precautionary measure.

The first rumours were heard around 7.30pm about “violence” in Madanpur Khadar in southeast Delhi, close to Shaheen Bagh. This was followed by social media posts about “clashes” in west Delhi’s Tilak Nagar and neighbouring areas. “Reports” also started floating about violence in other places, including Faridabad. However, police acted swiftly this time, putting a lid on the rumours through prompt social media posts and other measures. Cops also arrested two people for rumour-mongering.

As rumours abound, people call up relatives out of fear

Most of the rumours were spread via WhatsApp groups and Twitter. DCP west Delhi was among the first police officials to react. At 8.17pm, the DCP tweeted, “Rumour is the biggest enemy. A rumour has been noticed that there is some tension in Khyala-Raghubir Nagar area of west district. There is no truth behind it. All are requested to keep calm as the situation is absolutely normal & peaceful.”

At 8.32pm, two posts in the Delhi Police’s Twitter handle asked people not to fall prey to rumours and not forward unverified messages while maintaining calm. Police deployment was also stepped up in the areas named in the rumours to avoid any flare-ups.

Earlier, at 7.53pm, Delhi Metro tweeted that the entry and exit gates of the Tilak Nagar stations had been closed. Half an hour later, it announced that six other stations — Nangloi, Surajmal Stadium, Badarpur, Tughlakabad, Uttam Nagar west and Nawada— had been shut.

At 8.40pm, DMRC announced that all stations had been opened. Sources said that police suspected a conspiracy behind such large-scale rumor-mongering, which they said had taken place in a “coordinated manner”. The cyber cell has started a thorough probe.

Several twitter handles had been identified for spreading fake news of clashes, an officer said. In south-east Delhi, police received multiple calls of clashes and riots as people from Madanpur Khadar and Okhla called up the control room seeking help and informing them about “violence”. In the Khadar area, police are probing if a mild commotion about some thief being caught at a shop led to locals spreading news. In no time, rumours had started about “stone-pelting” in Baljeet Nagar, Patel Nagar and Karol Bagh , etc.

In Khayala, police said there was some commotion as local cops had caught some gamblers indulging in satta (illegal betting). Sources said that when caught, the accused apparently tried to escape screaming “riot”, which led to a commotion. In Mangolpuri, local police carried out flag march and went around telling people to not fall for rumours.

By 8pm, WhatsApp groups of RWAs across the city were abuzz with people forwarding messages of “riots” breaking out in their areas. People from across the city were calling up their friends and relatives about their well-being.

The district DCPs soon started tweeting from their individual accounts, asking people to not spread rumours and help maintain peace.

Many SHOs and even senior officers released videos on WhatsApp groups announcing that there was absolute peace in their areas.

38,['2/03/2020'],clasico: Real Madrid win El Clasico to replace Barcelona at top of La Liga,"Lionel Messi wears a disappointed look as Sergio Ramos celebrates Real Madrid's second goal (AFP Photo)

MADRID: Real Madrid showed their character by beating Barcelona 2-0 in Sunday's top-of-the-table ' Clasico ', leapfrogging their rivals at the La Liga summit after a week in which their pride had taken a beating at home and in Europe.

Brazilian teenager Vinicius Jr scored the opener in the 71st minute with a strike that deflected off Gerard Pique, flummoxing goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen who had made some jaw-dropping saves, and substitute Mariano added the second in added time.

Real's victory means they lead the standings on 56 points after 26 games, with Barca slipping to second spot on 55, while Zinedine Zidane's side also crucially have the better head-to-head record in the event both sides finish level on points.

Real swallowed chastening defeats by Levante in La Liga and Manchester City in their Champions League last 16, first-leg tie in the past week but in the second half they overwhelmed Barca, threatening on numerous occasions before breaking the deadlock.

Barcelona had bossed the first period and twice could have taken the lead but were powerless to stop Real after the interval and their impotence was summed up when Lionel Messi raced towards goal but was easily tracked down by Marcelo.

Marcelo's tackle got as loud a cheer as the goals from Madrid's fans who had not been able to toast a league win over Barca at the Santiago Bernabeu since 2014.

The long-awaited victory was confirmed by an unlikely source in forward Mariano, who had only just come off the bench to make his first league appearance of the season.

Barca coach Quique Setien had remarked before the game that Real were under greater pressure to win after they had surrendered a three-point advantage over Barca by drawing with Celta Vigo and losing to Levante.

They were left further frustrated by their 2-1 home defeat by Manchester City which has seriously jolted their hopes of remaining in the Champions League and put Zidane back under pressure for the second time this season.

REAL CHANGES

The French coach restored Toni Kroos to the starting lineup at the expense of Luka Modric after dropping the German against City and also picked Marcelo over Ferland Mendy at left back.

Setien went for a four-man midfield instead of Barca's usual 4-3-3 formation, prioritising possession over pace in attack.

The first half was end-to-end but lacked quality.

Barcelona created clear sights of goal for Messi and Arthur Melo, both of whose efforts were well saved by Thibaut Courtois.

Madrid's main threat was the electric but raw Vinicius, who routinely got down the left but rarely knew what to do next.

Real looked far more determined in the second half, and Isco forced Ter Stegen into an outstanding flying save and then saw a downward header scrambled off the line by Pique.

The missed chances galvanised the home fans, however, who could sense their team were close to an opening.

There was a touch of fortune to the deflected opening goal, but Real's victory was thoroughly deserved.

PATNA: In a fresh bid to flush out Maoists from the state, the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) has decided to deploy its highly trained commandos in Red-hit districts to work in tandem with police.

A decision to this effect was taken at a joint meeting of senior officials of the SSB, state police and central intelligence agencies at Muzaffarpur on Saturday.

Sharing details of the meeting, IG, SSB frontier headquarters in Patna, Sanjay Kumar said on Sunday that the members of small action team (SAT) of the SSB would assist the Bihar police in anti-Maoist operations.

The IG said the SAT commandos, who were imparted special training in greyhound and jungle warfare, had won accolades in Jharkhand for their tremendous success in anti-Maoist operations.

There are altogether 10 such teams in the state, which will be deployed in Maoist-hit districts on the directive of the state police headquarters. The SSB has already deployed two battalions comprising 18 companies in Bihar for security of its border with Nepal and other security related affairs and anti-Maoist operations.

In neighbouring Jharkhand, two more battalions of the SSB were engaged in special drive against Red rebels. In Bihar, the SSB personnel were cooperating with the police officers in Jamui, Gaya, Lakhisarai, Aurangabad, Muzaffarpur and Munger districts. “Highly trained commandos who are below the age of 30 years, professional and motivated, are being deployed in Bihar for the first time,” the IG said.

ADG (law & order) Amit Kumar, who represented the state police at the meeting, said only four districts – Gaya, Jamui, Aurangabad and Munger – in the state witness Maoist activities. “The rebel outfit has no influence or support base in north Bihar now,” he claimed.

IG, SSB, however, admitted that Red rebels still have their influence in some pockets under Bagaha subdivision in West Champaran district and riverine belt in some districts such as Vaishali.

The meeting also discussed at length the measures to curb the incidents of drug trafficking and human trafficking along Indo-Nepal border. The officials also admitted that the gangs involved in narcotics and liquor smuggling have become more active in border districts after enforcement of total prohibition in the state.

""Though prohibition was earlier not on our agenda, it became important as reports of liquor smuggling from Nepal poured in from time to time, "" SSB's IG said. The SSB claimed to have seized around five lakh litres of liquor ever since the state was declared 'dry' in April 2016.

IG, Tirhut range, Ganesh Kumar, SSP of Muzaffarpur Jayant Kant and SPs of Sitamarhi and Madhubani also attended the meeting.

Thousands of people thronged the Tagore Memorial Hall, where the fair-cum-exhibition with 26 stalls was organized. The stalls showcased the popular handicrafts, tourist spots, agricultural innovations, food items and small scale industries of Bihar.

Local folk artistes from Bihar also performed at the three-day fest. “The third and the last day of Bihar Mahotsav witnessed a dance-drama christened ‘Rhythm of Bihar’ and performances by Maithili Thakur and Priyanka. Several people from different parts of Gujarat visited the stalls and enjoyed the performances,” an official of the Bihar art, culture and youth affairs department said.

Meanwhile, art, culture and youth affairs department minister Pramod Kumar said Bihar Mahotsava had also been organized in cities like New Delhi, Kolkata, Goa and Jaipur in the past. “In a bid to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we decided to celebrate Bihar Mahotsav in the state he was born. Moreover, Gandhi, who started his journey in Gujarat, got the title of Mahatma in Bihar’s Champaran,” he said.

The minister added that the event amalgamated the culture, tradition and art of both states with performances from Bihar and Gujarat artists. “Be it cultural programmes, handicrafts exhibition or authentic delicacies, the rich diversity of Bihar was on full display,” he said.

Several stalls of tourism department, Bihar Museum, Jeevika, Upendra Maharathi Shilp Anusandhan Sansthan and Sangeet Natak Academy did good business at the festival.

Pawan Kumar Priyadarshi, project manager (communications) of Jeevika, said stalls of ‘Didi ki Rasoi’ and Madhubani paintings were the most sought after at the Mahotsav. “Altogether seven stalls of jewellery, vases and Madhubani painting were set up by Jeevika.

If they fail to use this power, then they too are party to the injustice , as people come to the courts with their trust in us,” said Supreme Court judge, justice M R Shah , while asking judicial members and advocates to strive towards maintaining people’s trust in the justice delivery system.

“Whatever you do, do with commitment, trust, honesty and integrity,” he said while speaking at the ground breaking ceremony of the new court building in Rajkot on Sunday.

Indicating at the recent Delhi’s riots without naming it, Justice Shah reminded the judicial officers of their huge role in the delivery system and said: “You have seen in our country how things panned out when people took law into their own hands. When people’s trust in judiciary or justice delivery system gets shaken they become impatient. We need to think that why this has happened because people come to the court like they do to temples and we have to work in a way that their faith on justice is not shaken.”

Asking advocates not to go on strikes, he said, “Strike is actually injustice to the public at large. If you have any grievances, then work an extra hour to showcase your anger.” Justice Shah was a member of a bench that recently delivered the judgement holding SC advocates’ strike illegal.

Justice Shah also asked advocates to take the maximum benefits of mediation and alternate dispute resolution system. He also apprised the infrastructure created by state government in various court buildings. “Whatever power and position you got and what trust people has put in you and system, work in a way that that trust stays strong. Justice delivery system sustains only when the people’s trust in justice sustain,” he added.

Chief justice of Gujarat high court Vikram Nath said, “It’s almost six months in Gujarat now and I am finding the government’s cooperation and work culture very good. The judicial system gets tremendous support from the state government to run the judiciary of the entire state.”

The new court building will come in 14 acre land in Ghanteshwar area near FCI warehouse at a cost of Rs 118 crore. Work is expected to end in next two years.

44,['2/03/2020'],Good response for Palayam market revamp pre-bid meet,"Thiruvananthapuram: Smart City Thiruvananthapuram Limited (SCTL) has received response from five bidders, including those from outside the state, to take up redevelopment of Palayam market . It is one of the key projects being implemented as part of Smart City scheme. SCTL is expecting a consortium of companies to undertake the scheme as three major works have to be executed by the company that will win the bid.

The project involves design, supply and installation of prefabricated structures for constructing the rehabilitation block of existing vendors. Besides site clearance and construction of a new market building, it also involves design, supply, installation and maintenance of electro-mechanical car parking system within the basement of the proposed market building.

Five companies took part in the pre-bid meeting which was held last week. The first two components will be executed at Rs 12.7 crore and Rs 61.05 crore, respectively and the third component will cost Rs 8.17 crore.

SCTL wants three projects to be awarded as a whole so that it can do away with any kind of delay, which generally arises when three works are awarded separately. It will also put the onus on a single party, especially with regard to site clearance and rehabilitation of the vendors. SCTL CEO P Balakiran said he is hopeful of a smooth eviction process as part of temporary rehabilitation of vendors.

Presently, there are 165 fish shops, 20 chicken and meat shops,78 daily needs shops, 37 clothing shops and 94 fruits and vegetables stalls functioning at Palayam market. As part of the redevelopment 490 shops have been proposed in the market, where a four-storied building will come up. The entire project will cover 17,741.96 sq.m.

While inaugurating modernization of Chalai Market under Chalai Heritage Scheme, minister for tourism and devaswom Kadakampally Surendran had said there was so much delay on the part of vendors in rehabilitation, which affected the progress of the work. P Balakiran said the vendors’ concerns would be addressed and a prefab structure will be constructed for temporary rehabilitation.

SCTL is close to finalising the agreement with the firm for bio-mining of legacy waste at Palayam. The dumpyard will be cleared through bio-mining as part of the Smart City project. The temporary rehabilitation block for vendors and shop owners who have to be shifted for the modernisation of Connemara Market is being planned at the dumpyard.

Bio-mining of legacy waste/un-processed municipal solid waste is done by excavation of the non-biodegradable waste using a mechanical sieving machine or any other suitable equipment. Recoverable materials are segregated and recycled for reclamation of dumpsite land.

47,['2/03/2020'],Dead teachers served show-cause notices in Bihar,"Bihar School Examination Board office in Patna

PATNA: Bizarre it may sound, but two teachers who died more than two years back, were not only assigned the duty to examine answer copies of Intermediate examination but also issued show-cause notices for not showing up at the evaluation centre.

The show-cause notices were issued against two teachers, including Ranjit Kumar Yadav, who used to teach at Shaligrami in Begusarai and died in an accident in 2017. The other teacher was Gulam Haider of Project Balika Uchh Vidyalaya, Katoria in Banka district, who died in 2018.

The letters for the evaluation duty of government schoolteachers were issued by the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB), which had been forwarded to respective schools through the district education offices. The evaluation of answer copies for Class XII started across the state on February 26.

Begusarai district education officer (DEO) Devendra Kumar Jha told this newspaper over the phone that the BSEB had issued the joining letter of Ranjit, which the DEO office forwarded to respective schools. “Following the direction of the education department, we served show-cause notices to those teachers who failed to join the evaluation duty,” he said.

He added: “After we got to know from our sources that Ranjit died in an accident 2017, we verified it with the school and cancelled the show-cause.”

Education minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma said the department would verify the matter. “I’ll talk to Board chairman Anand Kishor to make sure that such incidents won’t happen in future. As per my knowledge, the show-cause letter was cancelled by the DEO,” he told this newspaper on Sunday.

The minister said due to ongoing indefinite strike of niyojit teachers, the Board might have not verified about these two teachers. “However, the evaluation work has been going smoothly. We have assigned 4,000 guest teachers for the evaluation work, which will be finished on time,” Verma said.

Government primary schoolteachers have been on indefinite strike since February 17 whereas niyojit teachers of secondary and higher secondary since February 25. Around 2,500 teachers were served show-cause notices whereas the FIR has been lodged against 1,300 teachers for boycotting the evaluation duty.

SURAT: Police arrested 52 people , including 13 women , for consuming liquor at a party in a farmhouse on Dumas Road on Saturday night. The accused had gathered to celebrate leap year. Police seized beer tins and three Vodka bottles worth Rs7,000, 14 cars worth Rs97 lakh , 46 mobile phones worth Rs13 lakh and a music system worth Rs30,000 during the raid.

Of the total accused, 39 men were produced in court which remanded them in police custody for a day on Sunday.

""When we reached there, we noticed that several cars were parked outside and music was being played loudly. We found that liquor was being consumed at the party after which we detained those present there.

While the pedestrian timer near the Kalighat Metro crossing allows pedestrians less than 6 seconds to cross a 80ft-wide road, the timer at the Jadavpur police station crossing allows a person just 3 seconds to cross the 60ft-wide street. In most cases, pedestrians only manage to go half way before the signal turns green for vehicles. TOI visited four key crossings and found how no one cares for pedestrians and how pedestrians themselves disobey rules.At Deshapran Sashmal Road-Netaji Subhas Road crossing in Tollygunge, the traffic light for pedestrians turns green every 90 seconds, but for only 5 seconds, leaving pedestrians, autos and rickshaws jostling to cross the road at the same time. “How are we expected to cross in 5 seconds in this traffic? I can barely reach the middle of the road by the time the pedestrian signal turns red and vehicles start moving,” said Kudghat resident Dhritiman Ganguly.The situation is worse at the Rashbehari Avenue-DPS Road crossing where pedestrians get 10 seconds to cross a 80ft-wide road every two minutes. To make things worse, the green light doesn’t work on at least one of the eight posts and the timer doesn’t work on at least three others. TOI found pedestrians running across the road even when vehicles began moving from multiple ends, making it a risky sprint.The situation is similar at the Rashbehari Avenue-Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Road crossing where the timers allow a pedestrian only 5 seconds to cross the road. However, all the timers and lights were functional here.The situation seemed worst at the Jadavpur police station intersection. At least one pedestrian signal was defunct and those crossing the road were given an impossible target of covering a 60ft stretch in three seconds. “I don’t want to violate the rules, but even before I could reach the median divider, the pedestrian signal turned red and vehicles began moving. For the rest of the road, I crossed like another jaywalker, raising my hand before approaching vehicles,” said Dhakuria resident Susmita Pal.“We conduct timely review exercises and if any changes or repairs are required, we take necessary action. But, at the same time, pedestrians need to be aware of the rules and should not give the excuse of too little time to cross or faulty timers if caught jaywalking,” said an officer.The cops had cut down the number of road accidents in 2019 to 267 from the 2018 figure of 294. However, in 2019, there were 151 pedestrian deaths against the 2018 figure of 146.“Ideally, to cross a road with two lanes in each flank, a pedestrian should be allowed a minimum of 12-14 seconds.

PATNA: After the state level workers’ meet of JD(U) on Sunday, LJP chief Chirag Paswan will be the next big political figure in Bihar to address his party workers and supporters at Gandhi Maidan in Patna on April 14 to mark the conclusion of his ongoing “Bihar First, Bihari First” Yatra. Chirag is apparently one of the most watched out leaders in the NDA in Bihar as he has been critical of allies BJP as well as JD(U).

Chirag had said at Sheikhpura on Saturday that though development has taken place in Bihar under CM Nitish Kumar, but more work is required to be done in several fields.

Talking to reporters at Sheikhpura, Chirag said: “Why Biharis migrate in highest number to other states. How will the issue of unemployment be resolved ... Nevertheless, talking about shortcomings of the government does not mean that there are fissures in the alliance government,” he clarified.

Earlier last week, he had said in Nalanda that BJP should take action against its leaders like Kapil Mishra and Giriraj Singh for making provocative statements, which were also among the reasons behind the loss of NDA in recently concluded Delhi elections.

Speaking at a public meeting at Jamui on Sunday, Chirag, who is the MP from the same constituency, said he would raise the issue of developing Lachhuar Jain Temple in the district on the lines of other big shrines like Badrinath Temple.

“This is the birth place of Bhagwan Mahavir. I have requested the state government several times to develop Lachhuar Jain Temple on the lines of several other big temples. Development of Lachhuar Temple would not only enhance the economic activities, it will also provide employment opportunities to youths from across the region,” Chirag said.

Apart from raising local issues, Chirag has also supported the demands of niyojit (contractual) teachers, who are on strike at present. The LJP chief claimed that he will include the demands of contractual teachers, including ‘equal pay for equal work’, in the vision document of his party. State government, on the other hand, has been taking strict action against the agitating teachers, including lodging FIRs and suspending them for dereliction of duty.

Chirag apart, his cousin and Samastipur MP Prince Raj has also been criss-crossing the hinterlands of the state under Bihar First , Bihari First Yatra of the party. He interacted with party workers in Paliganj assembly segment in Patna district on Sunday and asked them to spread awareness about the party’s campaign.

LJP sources said Bihar First, Bihari First Yatra, which was launched on February 21, is aimed at linking Bihar with the wheel of development by interacting with people and taking their feedback for framing a vision document. Chirag has said that LJP will release the manifesto of the party six months before the assembly elections in Bihar slated to be held in October-November, this year.

51,['2/03/2020'],JD(U) workers’ meet a flop show: Opposition,"Tejashwi Prasad Yadav

PATNA: Opposition parties in Bihar called the JD(U) workers’ meet on Sunday a flop show.

Leader of opposition in the state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav shared few photographs of the meet on his Twitter handle and sarcastically tweeted: “Congratulation for the success of great rally-cum-street show-cum-workers’ meet at Gandhi Maidan on the auspicious occasion of chief minister Nitish Kumar’s birthday. Those who are claiming to win 200 seats, could not even manage 50 people from each Vidhan Sabha constituency, in spite of using political, financial and muscle power and vulgar dance and song.”

Later, Tejashwi told reporters at Motihari : “JD(U) had actually organized a rally, but intentionally named it workers’ meet as they were never confident of pulling in people. Has anyone heard of workers’ meet at Gandhi Maidan? They could not even fill 20% of Gandhi Maidan and it was a flop show.”

Congress’s state spokesperson Rajesh Rathore said not even 15,000 people came to listen to a CM who is in power for the past 15 years. “In fact, only officials of the district administration and cops deputed on the venue were seen standing by the time Nitish was concluding his 100-minute speech,” he said.

RLSP national secretary general Madhaw Anand said JD(U) meet was to create pressure on its alliance partners before seat- sharing. “However, it was a flop how and people are not getting trapped by CM Nitish’s false claims,” he said.

HAM (S) spokesperson Danish Rizwan also gave a similar view and said: “I would advise CM Nitish to organize such meetings only at his party office, rather than making fun of Gandhi Maidan, where many big rallies and important political events have been organized in the past.”

52,['2/03/2020'],Lodhas to raise funds to repay $320 million bonds,"(Representative image)

MUMBAI: Lodha Developers International — a subsidiary of Macrotech Developers (formerly Lodha) — had proposed to float an international bond issue of around $200 million to repay the company’s $324-million bonds maturing on March 13, 2020. However, rating agency Moody’s has said the company can issue the bonds only after it deposits $118 million in an escrow account for repayment of its maturing bonds.

The fund-raising in the coming weeks is crucial for the developer. Moody’s has said its negative outlook reflects the market risk and uncertainty around Macrotech Developers’ near-term refinancing plans and a persistent level of refinancing risk over 12 months. The rating agency said that if the upcoming bond is refinanced, it could revise the rating to stable. However, if the company fails to repay the $324 million on time, it could get downgraded.

The company already has access to a $112-million inventory facility, secured against unsold apartments at Lincoln Square, one of Macrotech Developers’ London projects. However, around $78 million will be used to repay an existing construction loan at the project, leaving just $34 million for deposit into the escrow account.

“Any delays in receiving such proceeds will result in a shortfall in the escrow account and prevent the bond transaction from progressing, increasing the likelihood of default. Macrotech Developers does not have alternate financing arrangements in place to repay the maturing bond,” said Moody’s analyst Sweta Patodia.

According to the rating agency, even if the company is able to fulfil the conditions required to proceed with the transaction, the bond execution — of at least $225 million — remains subject to market conditions. In addition, there are more repayments coming up.

Macrotech Developers has a $672-million construction loan outstanding at Grosvenor Square — its second London project — which is due for repayment in March 2021. The company also has about $323-million debt maturing in its India operations over 12 months.

NAGPUR: An audio clip of a man demanding Rs15 lakh from a property dealer has helped cop filed an extortion complaint against him who had earlier filed a case of fraud against the dealer.

The accused has been identified as Gagan Chaurasiya, a resident of Sitabuldi.

According to police, Dhanraj Fuse, a property dealer, had a layout in Beltarodi and was selling residential plots. In August 2019, Fuse sold a plot to Gagan from his layout. However, after few days Gagan asked Fuse to give him another corner plot instead of the first one. Fuse transferred the corner plot in Gagan’s name.

After a few days, Fuse built his house on some of the plots in the layout, including the one he had earlier sold to Gagan.

Cops said, after Gagan learnt that Fuse had built the house on his earlier plot, he started demanding Rs15 lakh to sign a deed of transfer for the first plot. But when Fuse denied paying money to Gagan claiming that he had not paid for the second plot and it was given in exchange, the accused approached Beltarodi police station where a case of fraud was filed against Fuse.

Later, Fuse recorded an audio clip in which Gagan allegedly demanded Rs15 lakh from Fuse to sign the transfer deed of the first plot.

Fuse later approached Beltarodi police station with the clip. Officials, including senior PI VP Akot, took cognisance in the case and filed a case of extortion against Gagan.

“When the case of fraud was registered against Fuse he had not provided the audio clip. After we heard the audio clip, we registered the extortion case against Gagan. We have not made any arrests in both cases yet as the audio clip needs to be verified,” claimed PI Akot.

Several Facebook users recalled how, during the Calcutta riots in 1946, tram workers — Dorbee, Rezzak and Ishak — saved students of Victoria Girls’ College from a mob and sent them home with the help of police. Similar episodes of resistance and courage by tram workers to save a Muslim slum in Belgachhia and clear the tracks of bodies to restore normalcy in the city were also shared.Agnidipto Tarafder, assistant professor at NUJS, Kolkata, shared a story he heard from his grandmother about her father, a doctor. “Dadai’s (Sailendranath Dutta) chamber was on Free School Street and the majority of his patients were Muslims, Christians and Dalits. One day during the riots, a Muslim man entered Dadai’s home in Taltala, creating panic in the house. But Dadai recognized him as a patient. He had come to request Dadai to visit his home near Free School Street as his wife was very ill. Against objections from the family, Dadai visited the man’s home and treated his wife. They said they would guard Dadai with their lives. Dadai returned home safe and he, in turn, escorted them safely out of the Hindu neighbourhood.”Film-maker and activist Kasturi Basu shared stories of two women revolutionaries and the Calcutta riots of 1965 on Facebook. The first story was about Bina Das, who single-handedly prevented a “programme of action” by a group of boys in the government housing estate near Prince Anwar Shah Road. The boys planned to burn Muslim bustees in “celebration”. When they reached Das’s house, she drove them back into their houses and spent the night on guard with a stick.The second story was about the fearless Ila Mitra, who was an MLA from Maniktala. She stood facing a riotous mob, stick in hand, yelling “Stop!” in a Muslim neighbourhood in Park Circus during the riots.“I heard the first story from my friend’s father and the second was told by Mitra’s son Mohon in an interview,” said Basu, adding, “These are stories that need to be re-told.”Associate professor of history in JU Maroona Murmu posted about an incident where Muslim neighbours protected Hindus in the Beckbagan-Park Circus area at the cost of their own lives in 1992, when violence escalated after the Babri Masjid demotion.

58,['2/03/2020'],JD(U) meet: NDA sets ball rolling for Bihar assembly polls,"Nitish Kumar (ANI)

PATNA: The JD(U) workers’ meet on Sunday set the tone and tenor of NDA campaign in the upcoming state assembly elections due in October-November this year.

While addressing the meet, CM Nitish Kumar, who is also the JD(U) national president, outlined the party’s strategy by comparing the 15 years of Lalu-Rabri “jungle raj” versus less than 15 years of his rule of law and good governance and, asked the party workers to counter the opposition (RJD) charge against his government on law & order and development fronts.

It seems the NDA comprising JD(U), BJP and LJP in Bihar will have three-pronged strategy to take on RJD-led opposition. As Nitish highlighted his government’s success on the issues of law & order, pace of development, status of primary and higher secondary education, health, infrastructure and schemes for the minority community in the last 15 years, deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, in a tweet on Sunday, pooh-poohed RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav’s claim of bringing a domicile policy, if voted to power. LJP chief Chirag Paswan is on a statewide tour to prepare a vision document of his party for further development of the state under NDA rule.

Since his recent meetings with Tejashwi in the state assembly had sent confusing signal in the state that whether JD(U) is getting soft towards RJD again, Nitish used the opportunity to clear any doubt in the party’s rank and file by emphasizing that the NDA was intact in Bihar and it would win more than 200 seats in the 243-member Bihar assembly.

Speculations were rife regarding fresh possible political alignments after Nitish got the resolution adopted unanimously in the assembly against NRC and in favour of NPR only in its 2010 format, except including transgender column. RJD was pressing for a resolution against NPR and NRC and had brought adjournment motion in the assembly that day. Though the anti-NRC resolution had taken BJP by surprise as it was adopted in a swift move, barring a few of its leaders like agriculture minister Prem Kumar, it preferred to downplay the issue behind PM Narendra Modi’s statement that NRC had not been discussed yet and there was no need to create brouhaha over the issue.

The JD(U) had won the 2015 assembly election in alliance with Lalu Prasad’s RJD and Congress and formed the government before parting ways with them and joining hands with BJP in the state in July 2017.

Since the opposition RJD is raising the issue of unemployment in the state, Nitish did not miss the opportunity to mention the appointment of 3.5 lakh schoolteachers on contract to score a point while taking a dig at the Lalu-Rabri rule by asking how many appointments were made during that period.

61,['2/03/2020'],"Day after fire, Mohali building declared unsafe","Mohali: The building housing Vishal Mega Mart in Phase V was declared dangerous and unsafe on Sunday, a day after it was engulfed in fire.

To be on the safer side, the local administration filled 3-ft water in the basement of the building to ensure that the embers were doused. Firefighters were not allowed to enter the building as it was feared that it may collapse following cracks in the walls.

Officiating deputy commissioner-cum-additional deputy commissioner Ashika Jain said, “We will be conducting an inquiry into the incident. The report will be submitted to the chief minster office. Secondly, we will also secure technical advice from experts on the structural stability of the building to decide whether it should be demolished or not.”

The fire had broken out in the early hours of Saturday. It took more than 30 fire tenders, which made over 100 rounds, to bring the blaze under control in an operation that continued until Sunday, Jain said. “The firemen are still stationed outside the building to ensure that if any fire re-occurs, it can act on time. The building has been sealed,” Jain said.

The building was cordoned off as its structural safety was yet to be ascertained. Duty magistrates were appointed at the site round the clock.

Jain said fire safety rules should be followed by all to prevent such incidents. She said regular inspections will be conducted and legal action initiated against the non-compliant units.

Had the fire broken out during the morning or evening hours, lives could have been lost. An official said, “As the fire occurred at 8.30 am, there was no public in the shopping mall, otherwise it could have been a major tragedy. We have submitted our preliminary report to administration pointing out the discrepancies. We had already issued a notice earlier to the shopping mall for violation of fire norms.” He said he has reported to the administration that the building where hundreds of people came daily violated all fire safety norms. The basement had a single entry and exit point.

Dean of research R K Singla pitched it to the vice-chancellor’s committee on MPhil/PhD rules and the members liked the idea. On March 8, the committee’s detailed report will be tabled in a syndicate meeting for final approval. Dean Singla had proposed that Skype interviews will save the time and expenditure of the university, the candidates, and the examiners. Besides, the academic world has become technology-driven.

The committee discussed the case of a research scholar, who wanted the mathematics department to waive her fee after the cancellation of PhD. Members were of view that candidates who failed to complete their research degrees due to pressing circumstances shouldn’t face inconvenience because of harsh fines. They were in favour of fixing a minimum fine that was within the reach of all candidates, and seeking the syndicate’s approval. The committee proposed Rs 5,000 as cancellation fee for quitting the PhD programme, instead of charging candidates for every year.

Another committee recommendation was for lowering the qualifying score in MPhil/PhD entrance test paper I from 50% to 40%.

Earlier, the zoo used to charge Rs 30 from an adult and Rs 15 from a child for each show. The shows, however, were free for children below three years.

A zoo official said two 3D movies – ‘The Last Reef: Cities Beneath the Sea’ and ‘Conquest of the Skies’ – were screened on Sunday.

“The ‘Conquest of the Skies’ by David Attenborough is an evolutionary story on the extraordinary journey of the evolution of insects beginning with their flight from the very first insect to being the incredible collection of creatures which in today’s time rule the skies. The ‘The Last Reef: Cities Beneath the Sea’, on the other hand, talks about the world of water and its tiniest creatures and coral reefs,” the official added.

The interpretation-cum-3D theatre at the zoo was inaugurated in March last year by deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi. The theatre has a seating capacity of 150 people.

Patna zoo director Amit Kumar said the 3D movies will not just entertain people, but also educate them. “At least six shows of 45-minute duration each will be screened from 10am to 5pm for visitors every day,” he said.

“More than 15,000 people visited the zoo on Sunday. Of them, 532 people watched the shows. We want to give visitors a new-age dimension of learning through the movies screened at the zoo. People can see animals in their natural habitat through the movies,” he added.

In the video, Yadav can be seen lying on the ground at Gandhi Maidan and two party workers massaging his legs. One of the workers is seen preparing ‘khaini’ (chewing tobacco).

Yadav, however, said his leg was injured while he was entering the Maidan through a barricaded small gate. “I got minor injury in the leg. Some workers offered to do massage so that I get immediate relief. It was nothing unusual,” he said.

Yadav, a four-time MLA, is a popular leader of Nawada district. He won Nawada seat in a byelection in 2019. Earlier, he represented Gobindpur constituency in Nawada district thrice.

No private vehicles, except emergency vehicles, were allowed on roads, leading to Gandhi Maidan from 6am. Also, barricading on Fraser Road, SP Verma Road, Bans Ghat and eastern part of Ashok Rajpath and Bari Path led to congestion on the link roads.

Those unaware about the restrictions had either to take longer routes or keep trying alternate route to reach their destinations.

This was the second consecutive Sunday spoiler for Patnaites, as similar obstruction in vehicular movement was witnessed on February 23 owing to Bhim Army-led Bharat bandh in protest against the Supreme Court ruling that states were not bound to provide reservation in government jobs or quota in promotion.

Residents are unhappy with such restrictions on every Sunday. Dipak Kumar has been cancelling plans for the last two Sundays to take his kids to zoo.

Mahwish Fatima, 24, had to call off her pre-planned birthday party on Sunday. She had arranged for a get-together with her friends at a restaurant on Boring Road.

Sabzibagh resident Shahnawaz, whose sister’s wedding was scheduled on Sunday in a hall near Bank Road, transported all edible raw material to the venue a day before. “We requested the manager of the hall to give us one room at least in advance, so that we could store all edibles on Saturday night. We did not want to take any risk as the stretch of road leading to hall passed by Gandhi Maidan,” he said.

Even shopkeepers rued poor sales this Sunday. “Though Holi is nearby, we could not get expected number of customers as people preferred to stay at home, than getting stuck on roads,” said Chotu, who works in a shoe shop on Boring Road.

MOTIHARI: Leader of opposition Tejaswi Prasad Yadav said on Sunday that if voted to power in the upcoming assembly elections, his party (RJD) will bring a domicile policy and reserve 90% of government jobs for natives of the state.

“Around 7 crore educated youths are running from pillar to post to get a job in the state for the last 15 years. I would urge people to exercise their franchise in the upcoming election keeping in mind these issues and remove Nitish Kumar government, who is only busy in saving his chair,” Tejashwi said in a public meet at Zila School Maidan here under his ‘Berojgari Hatao Yatra’.

He said CAA and NRC are ‘kala kanoon’ (black laws) and anti-poor and asked people to fight against these laws. “The NDA government is trying to divide the society but RJD chief Lalu Prasad is still alive and we, the party workers, stand behind minorities, Dalit and OBCs to protect their constitutional rights,” Tejashwi said and stressed on the need to maintain communal harmony at any cost.

“The problems in our state are unemployment, poverty, poor health facilities, bad education policy and corruption in government offices. But the NDA government only talks about Pakistan. The corrupt government officers are indulged in bribery and they don’t care even about peoples’ representatives,” he said and added: “Common people have no way out to get their work done in government offices without giving bribe. The NDA government has promised to double the income of farmers but they are selling their grains in open market at lower prices.”

Tejashwi said Nitish government has no vision or road map for all-round development of Bihar. “Nitish has failed to fulfil the aspirations of common man in the last 15 years. A strong will power is needed to make modern Bihar and solve the problem of unemployment. We, the RJD men, have strong will to address all such issues plaguing the state,” he said.

Talking about the long awaited beautification of historic Moti Jheel in Motihari town, Tejashwi said that funds to the tune of several crores have been swindled in the name of its beautification but even encroachments have not been removed in the last 15 years.

Tejashwi claimed that if voted to power, he will get reopened all closed sugar mills in Champaran, in which hundreds of people will get employment.

SURAT: After their ‘love at second sight’, the infamous runaway in-laws from Surat have eloped for a second time!

The lovebirds – 45-year-old textile businessman and his son's former mother-in-law – were brought back home the first time after spending 17 days together in January. Having spent a lonely Valentine’s, the duo decided to elope again, and on Saturday both disappeared from their respective homes.

Incidentally, the duo’s children called off their own marriage in the heat of their parents’ affair. Sources close to the development informed that the businessman's in-laws had recently held multiple meetings with him at his residence in an attempt to convince him to forget the ‘other’ woman.

“The family must have come to know that he is still in touch with the woman after which they started counselling him,"" the source added.

However, while that was going on, the man failed to return home in Chhaprabhatha area on Saturday night after which the family members started searching for him. ""They had a doubt that he may have gone to meet the woman and so, got their doubts checked through a common source. They found out that the woman also did not return home,"" said a community leader.

The community leaders were alerted by relatives of both the individuals after the duo disappeared again. ""The businessman's family told us that they do not wish to search for him. Similarly, the woman's parents too have refused to search for her,"" the community leader added.

After the couple returned home the first time, the woman was not allowed by her husband, a diamond broker, to enter his house despite several efforts and so she had to shift to her parental home.

The couple is now suspected to be hiding in Varachha area and has hired a house on rent. ""Though they did not share exact location, the businessman called up his friend on Saturday night asking for monetary support,"" said a person, who is in touch with the man’s family.

Talking to TOI after his return on February 8, the businessman had claimed, ""I will take responsibility of her (the woman) if she is not accepted by her husband."" He, however, denied having any contact with her then.

Terming her elopement as a mistake, the woman too on February 10 told TOI, ""I am not in touch with him any more and I wish to go back to my husband. I don’t want to keep any relation with him.""

After they disappeared on January 10, the duo went to Ujjain . They were traced in Indore on January 27 and brought back to the city by family members. The businessman and the woman knew each other since their school days in Katargam . Her father, however, had rejected the man’s proposal to marry the woman. Later they met in the recent past when her son and his daughter were engaged to be married.

When I questioned him, he told me to hire another vehicle. I was forced to walk along the traffic-choked road until I got another auto, which charged me only Rs 20,” she said, adding that there are auto drivers who behave decently with passengers and charge only the exact amount.The high court had issued an order in February this year directing the government to display printed fare cards but it has not yet been implemented.

PATNA: Errant school bus drivers will now be penalized under the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, as per the latest guidelines issued by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), Bihar State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (BSCPCR) and Bihar Education Project Council (BEPC).

According to a senior functionary of BSCPCR: “School buses should have speed governors to check overspeed, which is not only dangerous for the children but for other motorists and pedestrians on the road as well. Speed governor will keep a check on overspeed.”

He added: “School Bus must be written on the front and back of the buses and should display ‘On School Duty’. The name of the school along with contact details should also be displayed on the bus.”

Besides, school buses should have horizontal grill-fitted windows with mesh wires and doors should be fitted with locks in order to reduce the safety risks of schoolchildren.

A slew of other measures, including provision for a first-aid box and fire extinguisher, are required to ensure safety of schoolchildren in buses. As per the guidelines, every school bus should have closed doors with a lock system. Alarms should also be fitted on the doors in order to give warning to the drivers in case they are left open.

School authorities have been directed to inspect the school buses on a regular basis. “The authorities should appoint only those drivers, who have five years of experience in driving a school bus. Closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras should also be installed for ensuring the safety of students. Also, three adults, including a trained driver, conductor and lady attendant should always be present on the school bus,” the guidelines stated.

The governor said transmission of book knowledge was not the final aim of education. “Character building of the students was no less important, for which a concerted effort was needed. Peace and harmony were sine qua non for the country’s development and it is our national duty to make India develop and prosper,” he said.

Dwelling on the challenges facing higher education in the state, the governor said full implementation of the academic calendar, including timely admission, transparent registration, sincere classroom practices, fair exams and evaluation and result publication were the important ingredients of academic calendar.

The governor hoped that the universities in the state will ensure that distinct improvement is recorded in state’s higher education system to make it compare favourably with the other national and international institutions.

In his welcome speech, Magadh University VC Prof Rajendra Prasad regretted the shortage of teachers. He said despite recent recruitments, the shortage of teachers persists and there was need for appointment of guest teachers.

The VC informed the governor that vocational education in 45 different subjects was being imparted in the university under the self-finance mode. He also said PG diploma courses in defence management and disaster management would be introduced in the university. It has been his endeavour to cultivate a science based value system in the university and give shape to innovation in the field of education. He also said that the academic sessions would fully be regularized in the next few months.

The VC said the proposed exchange programmes with educational institutions of China has hit a roadblock on account of spread of coronavirus.

Speaking on the occasion, MU alumni and state agriculture minister Prem Kumar said resource crunch would not be allowed to come in the way of the university’s development programmes.

Other dignitaries present on the occasion included additional chief secretary-cum-secretary to the governor Brajesh Mehrotra and MU syndicate member Anil Swami. Registrar professor S P Deen proposed the vote of thanks.

CHANDIGARH: Anju Kumari, a student of Government Model Senior School, Sector 26, has bagged a gold medal in the recently-concluded Moscow Wushu Star 2020 held in the Russian capital from February 24 to 29, bringing laurels to the city.

The annual tournament is duly recognized by the International Wushu Federation and the European Wushu Federation. Around 700 athletes from 19 countries participated in the tournament.

Born to a gardener father Bal Krishan deputed at Butterfly Park, Sector 26, Anju got her initial training on self-defence from Swayam Team of Chandigarh Police before being spotted by the Wushu Association of Chandigarh .

The 17-year-old, one of five siblings, started her training under the Wushu Association of Chandigarh a couple of years ago and immediately proved her mettle by winning a gold medal at the 18th Junior National Wushu Championship held in the city in September 2019.

Coached by Sandeep Malik and coaches Manoj and Ram Mehar during the national camps, the youngster’s expenses were borne by the Wushu Association of Chandigarh.

Elated at her achievement, Sudershan Kumar, general secretary, Wushu Association of Chandigarh, termed it as a “prized moment for the city’’.

“She has been training with us for the past two years and from the first day, she was a special talent for us. We had no hesitation in bearing all her expenses, including the routine medical fees. We are also grateful to the Sports Authority of India and the sports ministry for their support,” Kumar told TOI.

“We congratulate Anju and her coaches on her success. It is a proud moment for us at the association, which runs without any financial and infrastructural support from the UT administration. I hope her medal will bring in a positive change for the other athletes in the city,” he added.

Anju’s family is delighted at their daughter’s feat. Krishan told TOI, “We did not know about the sport initially, but we let her learn self-defence, as you know these days girls need to protect themselves. But then seeing her interests, we encouraged her to go for her training. This gold medal is a blessing from the wushu association and the coaches. I am thankful to them.”

Kumar further said Anju will get residential training at the recently-established SAI Wushu Centre of Excellence in Itanagar under the Khelo India Scheme. The Sports Authority of India will bear the cost of her education and training along with three more players from the city, Roshni, Komal and Gayatri.

The Indian team, comprising 29 players in the junior category returned with six gold, six silver and three bronze medals in various weight categories. Anju bagged the yellow metal in the junior (Sanshou) category under-52 kg.

The re-carpeting of the taxiway too has been completed.Officials said the works that began on November 20 will be completed before March 28 deadline and that round-the-clock flight services will resume from March 29.“Re-carpeting of the runway was one of the most crucial works at the airport in the recent past. The previous re-carpeting was done in 2009 when Cial had less than 70 flights a day. Now, it has increased to 260 services catering to nearly 30,000 passengers a day. Though we had to shut down the operations during day time, only five services were cancelled as all the airlines got enough time to reschedule timings as they were intimated one-and-a-half year in advance,” said P S Jayan, corporate communications manager, Cial.As per the director general of civil aviation’s prescribed norms, all airports should re-carpet their runways once in 10 years. “Though the old runway was in perfect condition, we could not have delayed it any longer because, if the bitumen layer of the runway started developing cracks, it would be dangerous,” said an official.Along with the runway re-carpeting, the AGL (airfield ground lighting) system at the airport is also being upgraded to category III from category I. This include upgrading approach lighting systems, runway lights and taxiway lights, among other things. This will considerably improve operational efficiency and aerodrome safety, especially during adverse weather conditions.

79,['2/03/2020'],Pathrakulam land: Govt’s plans may not bear fruit,"Thiruvananthapuram: After two consecutive failures to convince the court in the past three years, the state government made optimum use of an additional day in February to resume the land, where the Theerthapada Mandapam is situated ( Pathrakulam ). It was assigned to Shree Vidyadhiraja Sabha four decades ago.

The hasty takeover and a string of loopholes in Saturday night’s order has now opened channels for another round of legal battle.

“We are moving high court. The forceful takeover has no legal validity,” said Ajay Kumar, secretary of Shree Vidyadhiraja Sabha.

Through its order, the revenue department has wiped off any illegality in filling up Pathrakulam after contending repeatedly in the past that it was unauthorised and had been responsible for blockage of drainage and consequent flooding.

However, the government clung on to the point of non-payment of amount for land assignment, a contention which the court had refused to accept in 2017 and 2019. It all waters down to a matter over payment of Rs 48,750 as land value which ought to have been paid by the society: First as 50% and then as two annual instalments by 1978.

In the hearing held in 2018, it was pointed out that the society owed Rs 24,375 as balance payment for the land to be assigned to them. Even considering simple interest, the society representatives say that it would come to less than Rs 2 lakh and in case of a cent percent penalty, it would still be less than Rs 4 lakh.

The issue, however, is the missing documents. In the latest order, the revenue department points out that the society failed to produce documents to prove payment of remaining 50% of land value.

The contention that they submitted original receipts with the application for title deed cannot be accepted since such an application could not be found at village/taluk or collectorate level. Revenue principal secretary V Venu said the cardinal point based on which the government resumed the land is that the society failed to make the required payment.

“The burden of proof is on them as they failed to furnish evidence of payment,” said Venu. He said it is the only point based on which the land was resumed. As regarding the matter pertaining to land being transferred by the society to a trust, he said it was just an observation and the resumption order was based only on arrears.

The society had filed an application under RTI Act in January 2020 at Vanchiyoor village office seeking scrutiny of registers of income between 1975-1980. The public information officer replied that the registers were destroyed and hence information regarding income received between 1975-1980 cannot be made available.

Kumar said the government’s continued insistence on non-payment of balance amount accounts to contempt of court. “On previous two occasions, such a reason was quashed by the court,” he said. He also referred to the RTI reply and said that the government itself cannot store its documents properly and now it asks for evidence from the society.

According to the Sabha, it made 50% payment in 1976 and the balance was paid in 1977 and 1978 at Vanchiyur village office. When asked why it failed to produce receipt of payment made in 1977, Kumar said: “The application for title deed was filed by submitting original receipts.”

80,['2/03/2020'],BHU docs threaten to stop emergency service at hosp,"Doctors said BHU authorities have failed to allay security concerns

Varanasi: Continuing their strike for second consecutive day on Sunday against assault by an attendant and his associates on their colleague, resident doctors have threatened to paralyse emergency services from Tuesday if their demands for arrest of all the accused and enhancement of security are not met.

As outdoor patient department (OPD) of trauma centre remains closed on Sundays, no effect of the strike was evident there. However, agitating doctors tried to hamper work at indoor patient department where patients are kept in wards.

Professor in-charge of trauma centre, BHU , Dr Sanjeev Kumar Gupta said, “Despite the strike of junior residents, treatment of patients, emergency services and ICUs were not affected as consultants and senior residents were available to manage it.”

Junior resident doctors, who held a meeting on Sunday morning, decided to continue their strike and alleged that during talks with them university officials could not give any concrete assurance on increasing the number of security personnel.

They said the police failed to arrest two other accused who had thrashed their colleague.

The doctors said if their demands were not met by Monday, they would paralyze emergency services from Tuesday.

On February 28, Badri Vishal of Sonbhadra district, who is studying in a private management institute, had allegedly misbehaved with a junior resident at OPD of orthopaedic department and later attacked him with the help of his two accomplices.

Inspector, Lanka, Bharat Bhushan said, “An FIR has been lodged under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intention insult), 506 (criminal intimidation), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of IPC and Section ¾ of the Medical Protection Act. Vishal was arrested on Friday night. His two accomplices have been identified and raids are on to nab them.”

The doctors had gone on the strike on February 29 in support of their demands. Elective operation theatres were partially affected due to the strike.

Besides holding talks with agitating doctors, the BHU administration made an appeal to resident doctors to call off their strike in the interest of patients.

Sending out a strong message that buying a vehicle without valid documents could land one in jail, police have also arrested four people, who had either bought stolen vehicles from the gang or taken them for sales.

Race Course police inspector Sujatha said the gang comprised three youths - R Vignesh Bharath, 23, an autorickshaw driver from Dhandapani Street at Pappanaickenpalaya; M Marudhachalam, 22, an auto driver from Kumarapalayam near Annur; and S Sabari, 20, a two-wheeler mechanic from Annur – and a 16-year-old boy.

According to her, the gang was busted during a vehicle check that was taken out on Friday night. “We stopped a motorcycle that had two pillion riders. The trio not only failed to produce valid documents for the motorcycle, but also gave contradictory statements. We took them to police station and during further inquiry they confessed to have stolen the vehicle,” the officer said.

Explaining the gang’s modus operandi, the officer said it was the minor boy’s responsibility to steal the motorcycles by using fake keys. “Vignesh befriended the boy and taught him how to steal motorcycles. They limited their activities to Pappanickenpalayam area, and it was the duty of Marudhachalam and Sabari to identify the motorcycles to be stolen and assist the minor boy. In total, they have stolen nine motorcycles from Pappanickenpalayam area.”

While they sold two motorcycles to M Abdul Rahman, 20, a car driver from Annur, and S Vigneshwaran, 22, a carpenter from Puliyakulam, for Rs 5,000 each, three each vehicles were handed over to R Ramesh, 33, a power loom worker and K Prabhakaran, 24, a van driver, both from Annur, for sales.

“We have arrested these people also and recovered from them eight motorcycles. The ninth one we had taken into custody during the vehicle check,” the officer said.

All the arrested were booked under Sections 120 (b) (criminal conspiracy), 379 (punishment for theft), 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property) and 414 (assisting in concealment of stolen property) of the Indian Penal Code.

While the minor boy was produced before the juvenile justice board and lodged in the juvenile home at Lakshmi Mills, the remaining seven were lodged in the Coimbatore Central Prison under judicial custody.

HYDERABAD: Bhadradri-Kothagudem police arrested five Maoist party couriers while they were transporting explosives stolen from stone crushing units to Maoist cadres on Saturday.

Police suspect that Maoists are planning to use the stolen explosives to target police by setting up landmines.

At around 11 am on Saturday, during a vehicle check in Jagannadhapuram village of Paloncha mandal, Paloncha (Rural) SI K Sridhar and his team spotted six persons travelling on two bikes and a Tata Magic vehicle. Upon seeing the police, one of the suspects fled the spot.

The police managed to arrest the other five persons, including P Saraiah (45), resident of Nimmalagudem in Kistaram mandal of Sukma district, Chhattisgarh, K Murali (24), K Nageswara Rao (40) of Dabbanootala village in Dummugudem mandal, K Sammaiah (26), Veerabhadrapuram village in Dummugudem mandal and J Hanumanthu (28) of Toggudem in Paloncha mandal.

Police seized three vehicles, 40 gelatine sticks, 40 detonators and 27 explosive boosters from the possession of the accused. “During interrogation, the accused confessed that as per the request of Maoist party state leadership, they have been working as couriers for Maoist party.

87,['2/03/2020'],"Real victim in marital discord is always the child, says Delhi court","Representative image

NEW DELHI: In the case of a warring couple, the real victim is the child, a city court has observed. It also questioned why, in cases of dispute between a man and his wife, the burden to look after the child always fell on the woman, who fends for herself while men around her ogle?

“There may be dispute between both of them with respect to marital life but what about that child who is the actual victim,” judge Ajay Goel questioned.

Goel was hearing a matter stemming from a domestic violence case filed by a woman. Her mother-in-law had filed an appeal against an order refusing to discharge her in the former’s domestic violence case. Interestingly, the judge narrated the scenes in his court in his order.

It was seen in the order that a woman was struggling with two bags — her office bag and a school bag — hung on her right shoulder with a child on the left while the husband stood behind his mother. The woman, teary eyed, barely managed to hold the case files. The child seemed restless, unable to fathom why she was there. “The little angel had done no wrong. Her fault is that her father chose to bring her in this world without any responsibility,” it noted.

It went on to observe that litigation is between a man and wife. And societal norms have paved the way for him to remain careless and free from the responsibility of bringing up a child — mentally, financially and emotionally. It pointed out that when a woman starts earning, it is argued that she is capable of maintaining herself.

In the case before Goel, it could be seen that the father didn’t even bother to extend his arms towards his estranged wife to help carry the child. While the husband was enjoying all luxuries — a car and a home — the wife travelled by bus to work, to drop off her child at school and to court to fight her case. It remarked, “The court could decide on the facts, but its heart burns.”

Keeping in mind the background, the court had to decide on the appeal filed by the woman’s mother-in-law, who claimed to have severed her relationship with her son, and therefore, there was no ground made for her to be party to the domestic violence case. She also argued as it was a love marriage, there was no dowry exchanged between the families.

The wife disputed her mother-in-law’s contention and called hers a “love-cum-arranged” marriage, for which her side of the family spent over Rs 15 lakh. She claimed the jewellery and other ornaments that she got from her mother were taken from her and deposited in a bank locker.

The court, meanwhile, took note of the “lies” spoken by the mother-son duo. “On the one hand, the petitioner is saying she had severed her relationship with the son and had debarred him from the properties but the son is standing in the court beside her defending her; bringing her to court; dropping her from the court to home; living with her,” it said. The observation prompted the court to further remark, “Rather, both of them should be prosecuted for taking a wrong defence and that too to harass the lady.” As a result, the court dismissed the mother-in-law’s appeal.

88,['2/03/2020'],‘Mission Shakti’ strikes its target with precision in Nagpur,"U Rajababu addresses the gathering at BRA Mundle Hall, South Ambazari Road, on Saturday

Nagpur: Facts regarding India’s anti-satellite ‘ Mission Shakti ’ were unfolded by project coordinator at the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO), U Rajababu, at a programme organized by Vidarbha Pradesh Mandal of Vigyan Bharti recently.

The programme was staged on the premises of the Blind Relief Association, South Ambazari Road.

The anti-satellite missile or a kinetic kill vehicle was launched as part of the test on March 27, 2019, from Abdul Kalam island. The aim of the test was to hit-and-kill a satellite in the Earth orbit. The mission was successfully accomplished and it made India the fourth country to have tested an ASAT weapon after the US, Russia and China.

On the accuracy of launching the weapon, Rajababu explained how important it is to be sure regarding the time, location and other aspects. He added that as time zones differ in various regions, the team launching India’s anti-satellite (ASAT) ensured that no errors were committed.

He highlighted the challenges faced by his team while preparing for the mission. The biggest challenge Rajababu faced was to give instructions to employees as they were unaware of the actual plan. The secrecy of the mission had to be maintained for many reasons. Only a handful of people knew the actual motive.

Rajababu’s address included diagrams and pictures which gave a better insight regarding the concepts proposed by him.

Highlighting the achievements, Rajababu said that the mission was carefully designed. This indicated active participation from Indian industry in concurrent mode. He added that the hit-to-kill accomplished against the live satellite with an accuracy of less than 10cm is by far the best reported performance worldwide.

Rajababu’s presentation was followed by a short interactive session with the audience.

90,['2/03/2020'],City residents pitch for a practical corpn budget,"Trichy: During the past seven years, the residents of Trichy have heard several promises from Trichy City Corporation on the development front, many of which remain unfulfilled. As the civic body is preparing to table the budget for 2020-2021 for the fourth consecutive year in the absence of an elected council, residents have urged the civic body to be more practical and futuristic in implementing projects.

In 2013-2014, the corporation tabled a budget by announcing that the large Yanaikulam ground in Singarathope will be utilised for constructing a four-floor commercial complex. The proposal still remains a non-starter. Similarly, a proposal to relocate the existing Puthur fish market to Kasivilangi on the outskirts also remains on paper. The long-pending proposals in the previous years’ budgets such as an integrated bus terminus (IBT), bus stand at Srirangam and shifting of the wholesale traders from Gandhi Market to outskirts are yet to materialise.

""Satellite bus stands are needed if IBT is getting delayed. Proper pedestrians platforms are absent in many areas. The authorities should give priority to removing encroachments on roads,"" Deepak Saravanan, a resident of KK Nagar, said. In 2013, the corporation mooted a plan to set up a water theme park at Panchapur. However, the proposal did not materialize.

A heritage centre planned at the corporation’s main office to portray the historical significance of Trichy has also been grounded. Apart from promoting recreational sites, residents have demanded to improve road infrastructure to eliminate snarl ups. ""Trichy needs new flyovers. Localities such as Head Post Office signal are too congested. We need to focus on providing elevated roads,"" Subash Chandran, a resident of Woraiyur, said. Last year’s budget promises such as the redevelopment of Mavadikulam tank and renovation of the old Cauvery bridge at Srirangam still remain unfulfilled. Officials said that the budget for 2020-21, which is being prepared, will focus on the key issues.

PANAJI/PONDA: Goa police's crime branch arrested activist Ramkrishna Jalmi on Sunday for hurting religious sentiments by making derogatory remarks at an anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) rally at Benaulim in South Goa on Saturday.

“We have received a complaint from Mapusa-based Hindu Yuva Sena against Jalmi for making derogatory remarks against lord Parshuram,” SP (crime branch) Pankaj Kumar Singh told TOI.

“Based on the complaint, we have arrested Jalmi,” he said.

The FIR has been registered under Section 259 A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious belief) and 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups) of IPC, Singh said.

The Hindu Yuva Sena, in its complaint, said Jalmi has deeply hurt the religious sentiments of the Hindu community. Jalmi was one of the speakers at the anti-CAA meet.

“Lord Parshuram, who is the sixth incarnation of lord Vishnu, is greatly revered and worshipped by the Hindu community,” the complaint states.

The group demanded stern action against the activist for hurting religious sentiments as well as to prevent any untoward incident arising out of the said "" hate speech "".

Demanding that FIR be registered to prevent any communal tension in the state, the group said that anger among the Hindus is being expressed on various platforms.

Meanwhile, another complaint was filed against Jalmi by Hindu Janajagruti Samiti (HJS) in Ponda.

Ponda police inspector Mohan Gaude said the complaint will be transferred to Colva police station, as Benaulim, where the meeting took place, comes under Colva police jurisdiction.

NEW DELHI: Around 90 shops in Connaught Place might face sealing action for alleged misuse and illegal constructions on their premises.

After surveying the recent report on properties in CP submitted by the New Delhi Municipal Council, the Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee found that many shop owners had constructed their ground floor below the ground lever to create inter-mediate floors in violation of the original lease deed and as per provisions under the Master Plan for Delhi 2021.

The committee directed the NDMC chairman to take punitive action against all such properties and submit action taken report within a month. “Many people created mezzanine floors or mid-floors and even extended it beyond permissible limit in violation of norms. When CP was constructed there was no provision for basement. However, over the years these were constructed illegally. We asked NDMC officials to issue show cause notices to violators and take action if their replies were not found satisfactory,” said a member of the monitoring committee on the condition of anonymity.

The direction was issued during a meeting called on February 20, regarding sealing operations and retrieval of government and DDA’s land.

In the minutes of meeting, it was mentioned that in connivance with officials of NDMC and Land and Development Office, shopkeepers constructed basements illegally, in violation of the lease deed.

“The architect department had done some survey and submitted a report to the monitoring committee sometime back. Other departments were yet to receive the committee order and details of the surveys officially. After seeing them, future course of action would be decided,” said an official.

Atul Bhargava, president of New Delhi Traders Association, said that none of the shopkeeper had received notices so far. “In fact, NDMC did not communicate anything officially,” Bhargava added.

BHUBANESWAR: The state government on Sunday lent a helping hand to a BSF jawan from Delhi whose house in the Khajuri Khas area of the national capital was damaged by rioters last week.

Chief minister Naveen Patnaik has sanctioned Rs 10 lakh for the repair of the house of 28-year-old jawan Mohammad Anees, who was posted in Maoist-hit Malkangiri district till the recent developments prompted the BSF to attach him to its HQ in Delhi. Naveen also spoke to the jawan over the phone and expressed regret at the violence.

“The chief minister consoled Anees and sanctioned Rs 10 lakh from the chief minister’s relief fund for him. Anees works in the BSF’s 9th battalion and was deployed in swabhiman anchal in Malkangiri,” a statement from the chief minister’s office said.

Anees expressed gratitude to the Odisha government. “A mob ransacked and set ablaze my house, which is located in a street in Khajuri Khas, on February 25. My father was alone in the three-storey home, as everyone else had gone to a relative’s place in Delhi,” he told TOI.

“On the morning of Tuesday, hundreds of armed miscreants attacked our house. My father begged them to go away, but to no avail. Luckily, my father escaped while the rioters torched our home by exploding gas cylinders,” said the jawan who joined the force in 2013.

Anees, who is to get married in April, visited his ravaged home on Sunday. He expects to be moved back soon to Malkangiri, where he has been working since September last year. Sources said he had earlier served three years in Jammu & Kashmir.

The BSF said the force had already started providing support to Anees. “We (BSF) have started repairing his house. Other help, including financial assistance, is being provided to the family,” BSF’s DIG in Delhi, Pushpendra Singh Rathore, told TOI over the phone. “In the wake of the unfortunate incident with Anees’s family, he has temporarily been attached to the BSF headquarters in Delhi. He may rejoin the Odisha unit when everything settles,” the DIG added.

KOCHI: Luis Das cycled all the way from Haridwar, covered 19 states, and reached Kochi a few days ago, to spread the message of hygiene . Dressed in full white, Das, an admirer of Mahatma Gandhi, had posters on cleanliness and Swachh Bharat campaign displayed on his cycle as he pedalled through the streets of Kochi.

Das, who hails from Morigaon, Assam, witnessed indiscriminate littering in all states he went through but he was expecting to not see garbage piled on roadsides in Kerala as well. “I had high expectations of Kerala but here also there is rampant littering,” Das said.

Das’s late father was a school teacher and his only brother a government servant. A 29-year-old unmarried man, Das who used to run a business of decorative items, found a guru two years ago and has been working at his ashram at Haridwar since then. He took up the ‘Bharat Yatra’ mission on October 30 and began cycling. He carries tent equipment, items for personal hygiene, a mobile phone, earphones and a microphone and speaker to talk to people about hygiene.

“Wherever I go, I meet with people to spread my message. I do a bit of online research ahead of my visit and tie-up with those interested in partnering with me. I have talked to students about the need for hygiene,” said Das.

He recollected how he had organized a solo sit-in at a town in Uttar Pradesh against littering. “I went to the town and found that even the government offices were unclean. So, I did a sit-in. Later I realized that if I keep on protesting, I am never going to complete my goal and moved on,” said Das.

Das said that his spiritual guide, Mahamadaleshwar Sidharth Giri Maharaj, assisted him in purchasing his gear and bicycle for the journey and he receives financial assistance from well-wishers on the way. He is waiting for permission to go to Lakshadweep from Kochi.

103,['2/03/2020'],"Locals protest for removing waste pile, say will write to PM","Dehradun: Miffed with the waste pile, residents of several areas, including Kargi, Banjarawala, Dehrakhas, Vidya Vihar, Brahmanwala, Majra and Clement Town, staged a protest outside the open garbage transfer station at Haridwar bypass road on Sunday. The locals say that the openly lying garbage at the transfer station is a “blot on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Swachh Bharat Mission”.

“We are left with no other option but to approach the Prime Minister’s office now. It seems that our demand to shift waste pile from garbage transfer station is not a priority for the administration. The residents have collectively decided to send a letter to the PMO in the matter,” said Aakesh Bhatt, a local.

The protesting locals allege that they have filed more than 250 complaints at the Uttarakhand Chief Minister’s portal but to no avail. Meanwhile, the locals continued to demand action in the matter from Dehradun Municipal Corporation officials and the mayor. However, they say no concrete action has been taken so far to address their issue.

“Living in this area has become a nightmare for us. The authorities have no idea what we go through each day. The decision to shift the transfer station was taken long back but the garbage pile is still here,” said Padminder Negi, another local.

Meanwhile, DMC’s chief health officer Kailash Joshi told TOI, “We have already identified a spot for shifting the garbage transfer station. The work is ongoing and will be completed by March 15.”

106,['2/03/2020'],"Month on, no system to check if Goans enter casinos for gambling","Representative image

PANAJI: A month after Goans were banned from gambling in casinos, the gaming commission has still not put rules in place. Without any notification, it is still unclear whether any Goan has been denied entry into any of the state’s 15 casinos for gambling.

The state government had notified the Goa Public Gaming (Amendment) Act, 2012, to ban the entry of Goans into the six offshore and nine onshore casinos in the state from February 1, and appointed the commissioner of commercial tax as gaming commissioner, to keep tabs on whether Goans were gambling at the casinos.

A senior official said that as the rules have not been notified, they have not conducted any monitoring or inspection of casinos to check if Goans are entering the casinos.

The official said that the gaming rules files have been sent to law department for vetting before they are notified. He said that chief minister Pramod Sawant had cleared the files.

Sawant had said that till rules are notified, tourists will not be stopped from entering the casinos, but action would be taken if Goans are found gambling at the casinos.

As per the act, the gaming commissioner has to issue a ‘tourist permit’, authourising tourists to enter the areas designated for gambling.

The gaming commissioner is empowered to exercise overall control over the games conducted in the designated areas and is also authorised to maintain the records and documents in connection with the games.

The commissioner has the right to order closure, to seal any casino in a five-star hotel or to take custody of any casino vessel, and while exercising this power, the commissioner shall make an inventory of all the items of which the custody is taken.

Banning the entry of Goans into the casinos was a long-pending demand of the people, with the legislators echoing their concerns in the House, as many families had gone bankrupt due to gambling addiction.

In June 2015, the home department had first drafted the rules, in which there was a provision to arrest any person under the age of 2, found gambling.

It was in June 2012 that the state government passed the amendment to the Goa Public Gaming Act, 1976, by introducing the Goa Public Gaming (Amendment) Bill, 2012.

107,['2/03/2020'],SC/ST scam: Four govt employees booked for forging income certificate,"Dehradun: In a first, the special investigation team (SIT) probing the multi-crore SC/ST scholarship scam in Uttarakhand lodged a complaint against three government employees on charges of forging income certificates. These certificates were allegedly used to claim scholarship money for their wards.

Rajpur police station in charge Ashok Rathore told TOI that an FIR was filed in the police station against three government employees under section 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery), and section 409 (Criminal breach of trust by public servant) of the IPC.

“We have lodged an FIR against Nainbagh resident Baldev Singh Tomar, Kalsi resident Mohan Singh, and Tyuni resident Sardar Singh. The annual income of the student’s family must be under 2.50 lakh for scholarship. The accused, who are government employees, have produced fake income certificates to get the scholarship money meant for economically-weaker SC/ST students,” said the official.

Another FIR was filed in the case against Vikas Nagar resident Gopal Singh, also a government employee, at Raipur police station. Reportedly, both daughters of Singh availed scholarship money by producing fake income certificates of their father.

Till now, the SIT had mainly filed cases against educational institutes which have allegedly siphoned off funds meant for SC/ST students. However, this is the first instance where wards of students have been booked for forging documents.

To recall, the state police department had set up the SIT to probe irregularities in the SC/ST scholarship scheme in April last year. The move came after they received complaints stating that colleges in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh claim scholarship money from the state social welfare department by producing fake documents.

Dehradun-based activist Ravindra Jugran had also filed a petition in the court alleging that it is a Rs 500 crore scam.

In Rayagada, a truck driver was imposed a fine of Rs 1.10 lakh towards different violations under the amended law.

In Bhubaneswar, the transport authorities issued challans amounting to nearly Rs five lakh to several violators on Sunday.

Though the new MV Act came into force on September 1 last, the state government had refrained from implementing it strictly owing to the unavailability of transport-related documents with people.

The state government had relaxed the enforcement drive for six months, the deadline of which ended on Saturday.

“Our focus is on strict enforcement of rules related to drink driving, speeding, driving against the flow of traffic, using mobile phone while driving, triple riding on two-wheeler, overloading, jumping the red light, not wearing helmets and seat belt,” state transport commissioner Sanjeeb Panda said.

He added, “We have asked the district collectors and SPs to prevent inconvenience to motorists during the checking drives. A maximum of four vehicles should be detained for checking at one spot to avoid traffic congestion.” tnn

113,['2/03/2020'],Silent efforts help indigenous cattle breeds flourish in Kerela,"KOCHI: The state consumes nearly 2.5 lakh tonnes of cattle and buffalo meat every year, and on the other hand it conserves indigenous breeds with negligible milch capacity. In the past few years, Kerala has seen concerted efforts by farmer groups and heritage breed conservationists in rearing heritage livestock, which has so far remained a silent activity.From the plantations of Cheruvally in Kottayam to the banks of Periyar in Ernakulam and the foothills of Thiruvilwamala in Thrissur and rural Vatakara in Kozhikode, several groups are trying to bring back rare farm animals from the brink of extinction.Two known success stories of indigenous cattle conservation from the state are that of Vechur cows, considered smallest in the world, and the Kasaragod dwarf. While Vechur cow has been recognized as an indigenous breed, the only one from Kerala, Kasaragod dwarf failed to gain the status.Currently, seven cattle varieties, excluding Vechur and Kasaragod dwarf, are being reared across the state. But a concerted effort at increasing the quality of livestock is being made in the case of four varieties - Periyar cows, found near Periyar River; Cheruvally cows of Cheruvally Estate, Vilwadri breed of Thiruvilwamala and Vatakara cattle. Lesser known populations like Wayanad cattle and Highrange dwarf are also being farmed by individuals.Dr Jayadevan Namboothiri, assistant director, animal husbandry department, said only localised efforts would work and conservation activities needed to move out of university environment.Cos Kurien, who leads the conservation of the Periyar variety, along with 40 other farmers has floated ‘Periyar pashu samraskshana samiti’. “Efforts to conserve Vilwadri stock are being carried out under the leadership of Ramesh Korappath of Ivor Madam while that for Cheruvally cattle are led by Lijo C Mathew. Vatakara cattle conservation is happening under the leadership of Dr P Girishkumar,” said Jayadevan.Scientists from National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources had visited the farms to collect samples of Periyar and Vilwadri cattle to determine their claim for indigenous breed status. Indigenous breeds can be maintained with zero input cost, are disease resistant and can withstand high temperatures. The milk is A2 quality, which will fetch higher value if properly marketed, and the dung and urine has special characteristics.“Indigenous breeds like Wayanad cattle has the potential to resist vagaries of climate change.

114,['2/03/2020'],Experts urge for a rethink on mega dam projects,"Convenor of climate and energy group Dr Soumya Dutta speaks at the conference on Sunday

Bhopal: The national conference on river valley has a word of caution for the governments and policymakers to give up ‘short-sightedness’ while planning river projects. The two-day conference began at Gandhi Bhavan here on Sunday.

Experts urged governments to take rivers in their entirety as they are not bound by the geographical boundaries.

A river economist, Dr Bharat Jhunjhunwala said, “There is no conflict between economic development and environment. The long-term development is environment. We need to have proper evaluation of cost and benefit of the projects.”

The difficulty is that the government looks at the short-term returns, he said “they are driven by commercial interests, they are ignoring the social cost ... But it is counterproductive”.

The expert said, “We need to push the government, plead with it or force it ... whatever possible — soft and hard — that you make a proper dispassionate assessment of all the benefits, all the social and environmental costs...if we are able to this, lot of issues are resolved ... it is not commerce against people, it is short-sightedness that is affecting us.”

Dr Soumya Dutta, convener of climate and energy group said that the government must recognise the rivers in their entirety. “They need to understand all the functions that a river performs but there are two popular terms when they talk about the rivers- Cumec (that is water flow unit) and MGH — how much hydropower it can generate.”

Datta said, “we have to dismantle some of the dams and many countries have started to realise this. Dam builders will always give argument of power generation ... but, do you know, we are power surplus state for fourth year in succession. The peak demand in India was about 1.90 lakh MW but we already have a capacity of about 4 lakh MW generation including about 58 000MW in captive power plants.”

Quoting the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), Dutta said, ""we don’t need any power plant for the next 8 or 10 years.”

Former chief secretary and now an activist SC Behar said, “We need to take the fight against the big dams to a different level.”

Water conservation experts, research scholars and activists working across the country in Ganga Yamuna valley, Godavari, Krishna, Polavaram, Kaveri, Kosi and Halon river valleys among others are attending the conference.

115,['2/03/2020'],"Teacher, who treks 8km to school, on a hunger strike","Thiruvananthapuram: K R Ushakumari, the only teacher at the tribal school at Kunnathumala in Amboori, who had won several accolades, including national honours, is in news again.

Ushakumari has been on a hunger strike at the school for the last three days, demanding job security and clearance of salary arrears.

“People know about my 8-km daily trek to school through dense forest. But, they don’t see my struggle after school to make both ends meet,” said Ushakumari.

Announcing her protest in a detailed Facebook post with a picture of a shelf full of awards she had received, the teacher shared her ordeal. “The awards are all laughing at me. I cannot appear for any PSC examination because of the age limit fixed for such exams. Will I get a permanent appointment? There is no answer to the question,” she said.

Ushakumari joined the Agasthya Multi Grade Learning Centre in Amboori panchayat as teacher in 1999, which is around 8km away from her home. Later, the centre was taken over by Sarva Siksha Abhiyan. Later, the qualification of the teachers was raised from SSLC to TTC.

“I have passed SSLC. I am now 52 years old and cannot go for another job. Many teachers across the state, who work in such schools, are above 55 years of age. We informed the government that we were are ready to complete the TTC course, if we get an official order in this regard. The assurance from government that our demand for permanent posting will be considered was never put in a written document. Believing in the false claims we all continued our work. But nothing happened. I have given 20 years of my life for this job. Don’t we deserve a happy retirement life. One can see the results of our efforts at the school and kids from tribal settlements,” said Ushakumari.

Mentioning about the delay in payment of salaries, Ushakumari said, “For the past five months, none of the teachers in the single-teacher schools received salary”.

“Recently, I along with other teachers approached the authorities concerned to check the reason for the delay in payment of our salaries. And we did not get a clear answer. It is then that I decided to conduct a hunger strike till I get a written assurance from the government regarding our appointment,” she added.

Officials of the education department said that file regarding disbursal of salary for the teachers will be cleared by the finance department in the first week of March itself.

116,['2/03/2020'],Securing shores: Navy officer upholds law on troubled water,"The India-Pakistan war in 1965 and the valour displayed by Indian soldiers had a telling effect on a young man from Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh. While villagers discussed the war and the developments, Chandra Shekhar listened intently.

“I wish that one of my family members too joins the armed forces to serve the nation,” his grandfather Choudhari Indrajit had said. Chandra Shekhar took his grandfather’s words to heart and joined the Indian Navy in 1969. “I chose to join the Navy as I liked the uniform,” Commander Chandra Shekhar recollected, in a conversation with TOI in the city.

Upon joining the armed forces, Chandra Shekhar got to play a role in the 1971 war against Pakistan as he provided logistic support from Goa .

As someone who was involved in providing logistics support in the Navy, Chandra Shekhar sailed to different countries. He was posted in different parts of the country, including Visakhapatnam. As part of the mine-sweeping squadron of a war ship, he would carry out operations to detect if there were any bombs in the water when the war ships moved. “I loved the sea,” the 72-year-old said, talking about his 22 years in the Indian Navy.

He also brought out sweeping reform by getting all the service records of Navy personnel documented thoroughly. “Otherwise, it was taking nearly 8-10 months for those who retired to get their pensions. In just one month, we put the service records in order without any gaps so that retired personnel would not have to wait for their pensions,” he recalled.

But it wasn’t just the sea and providing logistics that he loved. As a trial judge advocate in the Navy, he was firm that the guilty should be punished in court martial so that it can be a deterrence to others. In one instance, an officer who was charged with embezzlement of Rs 34,000 was dismissed and given a jail term. In another instance, a sailor attempted to attack a Naval officer on board a warship due to personal issues and he got a jail term and was removed from service. Chandra Shekar had also ruled to dismiss a naval officer for desertion. “What if he deserted the Navy during war?” Chandra Shekhar said, when officials wondered if it deserved a jail term.

Shekhar acted with Amitabh Bachchan in the movie ‘Kaala Patthar’ in a courtroom scene and also met with the then Chief Justice of Pakistan Muhammad Haleem. After his retirement, Shekhar has been engaged in teaching yoga.

The breed, also known as Kuttambuzha Kullan and Plantation Pashu, is mostly found in places like Kodanad, Malayattoor, Kalady, Paniyeli, Vadattupara, Kuttambuzha and Charupara, which are located close to Periyar River.

Scientists from the National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR) under the Indian Centre of Agricultural Research (ICAR) have already made visits to these locales to assess the cattle population and to determine their claim for indigenous breed status.

Leading the group of farmers is Cos Kurien, a native of Kodanad. “There are around 40 people who are actively involved in conserving Periyar cows. Now, there are 2,500 Periyar breed cows in the area,” said Kurien, who was honoured with Breed Saviour award in 2019.

Getting indigenous status is a laborious process. “As per the new eligibility criteria, the population need to have at least 1,000 animals and they need to have unique stable and uniform attributes. Periyar cow stands a good chance of being recognized because it meets several of these criteria,” said N Jayadevan, who was involved in efforts to procure breed status to Vechur cattle.

“I feel we haven’t been able to define it uniformly,” said K Anilkumar, professor, department of animal breeding, genetics and biostatistics. A major problem in conserving these breeds is the absence of bulls. “If the animal population is scattered, artificial insemination is the only solution. Lack of breeding plan may affect the population,” he said.

118,['2/03/2020'],Mark the planets to know your lucky colour this Holi,"rashi roulette: A vendor sells gulal in Prayagraj on Sunday

Prayagraj: Holi is round the corner and city-based religious scholars are flooded with queries from revellers seeking to know what colours suit them best as per their Zodiac signs and Vedic astrology.

Astrologers claim Holi will see powerful planets Jupiter and Saturn in their respective positions. Choosing colours based on planetary positions can ward off evil, they claim.

An astrologer Ashutosh Varshney said, the role of navgraha (nine planets) in our horoscope governs our birth, how we spend our life, death and beyond. “The nine planets are emitters or reflectors of rays of different colours. If a person is facing a rough patch under Saturn, also known as Shani sadhesaati (difficult period of 7.5 years), then he or she must play Holi with black and blue. These colours offer a healing touch for worries, stress and anxiety,” he explained.

The astrologer maintained that those “affected by Saturn” should avoid red which stands for Saturn’s enemies, the Sun and planet Mars. Those born under Aries or Scorpio, must play Holi with red as it will discard ill effects of Mangal or Mars, their governing planet. Similarly, Taurians and Librans, ruled by Venus, should go for shiny white to ward off evil influence of Shukra (Venus).

Gemini and Virgo, ruled by Mercury, should use green to buffer the negative influence of Budh (Mercury).

Cancer is ruled by the moon. Those undergoing a bad phase must use white. Leo, on the other hand, is ruled by the sun. Hence, red and orange are very favourable.

Sagittarians and Pisceans, ruled by Jupiter, should go for yellow and golden that symbolise the virtues of Brihaspati (Jupiter). Those aspiring to earn the virtues of the planet should use yellow in abundance, he suggested.

Capricorn and Aquarius are once again ruled by Saturn. Hence, black and blue in any form will earn the goodwill of Shani (Saturn) for those who are affected by the planet’s unfavourable position in their horoscope.

119,['2/03/2020'],Need more women farmers at the helm: Study,"Thiruvananthapuram: A survey by dairy development department has recommended formation of more women cooperative milk societies in the state, to have women presidents in societies at least once in 10 years and 40% seat reservation for women in the governing committees of these societies.

‘Women dairy farmers survey report-2019’, released by health minister K K Shailaja during the dairy farmers summit being held in the state capital, has also identified rise in fodder prices and high production costs as major problems currently being faced by dairy farmers.

The survey, claimed to be the first of its kind in the country, initiated on the recommendation of the state planning board, found that 59.8% of the women dairy farmers do not have membership in the Kerala dairy farmers welfare fund board. Of the total 3,647 registered cooperative milk societies, only 65 are women cooperative societies, the study said.

“This makes just 2.2% of the total number of the societies. Top priority should be given to formation of women societies. Whenever a new society is being formed, the possibilities for making it a women’s society should get special considerations,” the report recommended.

Citing the meagre presence of younger generation among women dairy farmers (12.2%), the survey report warned against a drastic fall in the number of women dairy farmers in the near future.

121,['2/03/2020'],"Cong, BJP gear up for Agar Malwa bypoll","Bhopal: The BJP and Congress are ready to flex their muscles in Agar Malwa ahead of bypoll, as both the parties are busy chalking out plans to wrest the seat. On March 2, chief minister Kamal Nath will visit Agar Malwa and announce major sops for the district, while the BJP has decided to hold a workers' convention on March 4 to display its strength.

Nath's visit to Agar Malwa district is likely to boost Congress prospects in the Malwa region as the CM is all set to announce development projects worth Rs 865 crore. ""The chief minister will distribute farm loan waiver certificates up to Rs 2 lakh at `Kisan Samman Sammelan’ in Agar Malwa. He will also lay foundation of development projects and dedicate a hospital in the district,"" said an official release.

To boost its prospect in the bypolls, the BJP will organise a mega worker convention on March 4 and expose the failures of the state government. On Sunday, BJP state president VD Sharma held closed-door meetings with former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and leader of opposition Gopal Bhargava at the state head office to plan a strategy for the convention. The BJP will also raise the issues related to crop loss due to the recent hailstorm. ""We have demanded survey and 100 precent compensation to farmers whose crops have been damaged by the hailstorm. The state government is betraying the farmers in the name of farm loan waiver, but relief has not reached farmers till date,"" claimed Sharma.

He said the BJP will survey the hailstorm-affected areas, including Gwalior Chambal region and parts of state, and demand compensation to the affected farmers at the earliest. The party is also likely to raise the issue of farm loan waiver, deterioration of law and order, apart from failures of the state government, during the workers’ meet. Kamal Nath's visit to Agar Malwa is just to woo voters and announce big sops ahead of bypoll. The state government has not fulfilled the promises made during the previous assembly election,"" said Bhargava, who along with Chouhan and VD Sharma is likely to address workers' rally in Agar Malwa on March 4.

This would be the first worker meeting the saffron party will organise under the leadership of newly appointed state chief VD Sharma. Sources said bypolls will be the litmus test for Sharma's organisational strength and political acumen.

Prayagraj: A manager of a UP Board examination centre and his son were among the three persons arrested for running a massive cheating racket in trans-Yamuna area of Prayagraj district on Sunday.

Special Task Force (STF) also recovered three mobile phones, screenshots of five WhatsApp chats and many solved answer sheets.

The accused were identified as Indrabhan Singh, Ashish Singh and Vikas Yadav, all residents of Meja.

Indrabhan was the principal and centre manager of the examination centre, his son Ashish was a computer teacher and Vikas a solver.

Additional SP (STF) Neeraj Kumar Pandey said, “We were tipped off about a gang of three running a copying racket in Meja. An STF team conducted a series of raids and nabbed the three accused from Meja.”

The ASP said that the accused had planned to submit the solved answersheets of class XII of mathematics on Saturday, once the exam was over.

“Vikas was arrested while he was solving questions of class XII mathematics examination near a brick kiln on Saturday afternoon hours,” the SP added.

During interrogation, Vikas told the police that he had to deliver the solved copies to Indrabhan, who was the principal and centre manager of Mata Daan Singh Inter College.

On the basis of Vikas’ statement, STF nabbed Indrabhan and his son Ashish.

The father-son duo told the police that they used to send question papers of class XII board exams to solvers through WhatsApp. They used to charge Rs 4,000 from each candidate to provide a solved question paper.

They used to charge candidates around Rs 35,000 to Rs 40,000 to provide copies of solved question papers of all subjects.

123,['2/03/2020'],KIIDC set to take over KWA bottled water plant,"KIIDC officials will visit the plant at Aruvikkara on Monday to review the remaining work

Thiruvananthapuram: Officially, it is curtains for Kerala Water Authority ’s ( KWA ) own bottling water plant . The water resources department on Saturday decided to hand over the ambitious project at Aruvikkara to the Kerala Irrigation Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd ( KIIDC ), which manufacturers the bottled water ‘Hilly Aqua’.

Officials of KIIDC will visit the Aruvikkara plant on Monday to review the remaining work of the project, mainly the BIS certification process. KWA’s bottling water project, which was cited as a major income-generating scheme, has been wholly transferred to KIIDC, with KWA eligible only for the lease, which is yet to be finalised.

As per the GO, the period of lease will be seven years initially. The KIIDC will be responsible for carrying out the remaining operations, including licencing with BIS and marketing.

The decision to hand over to KIIDC came up amid opposition of KWA employee unions, including Left-affiliated ones. Water resources department has cited inability to draw scarce resources for the bottled water project since KWA has to tackle more important works such as drought mitigation.

“KWA has been entrusted with administrative approval for over Rs 9,000 crore on drinking-water projects funded under KIIFB, Jal Jeevan Mission, state Plan, Nabard, etc. It may not be prudent to draw its scarce resources and divert its limited personnel to a niche market such as bottle water. KWA is over-staffed in lower cadres and need restructuring of its human resources. In view of the possible drought likely in the state in 2020-21, KWA needs to focus on drought relief. It is highly essential to operationalize the bottled water plant on a war footing which has already sunk a cost of Rs 16 crore,” the GO said.

Crediting KIIDC for successfully marketing ‘Hilly Aqua’, the GO stated that the expertise of KIIDC in obtaining the withheld regulatory clearances and floating cost-effective marketing campaign would be far superior to KWA or any other agency hired for the purpose.

KWA had envisaged the bottled water project at Aruvikkara as a model project for setting up similar ones in other parts of the state. With the project slipping away, KWA has to wind up similar plans too. The project, with a capacity to produce 7,200 litres per hour, was conceived in 2006 and the water supply and sewerages act was amended for it.

125,['2/03/2020'],HC quashes PDKV’s change in teachers’ promotion criteria in Nagpur,"Representative image

Nagpur: Quashing Dr Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth ’s ( PDKV ) decision to change teachers’ promotion criteria from merit-cum-seniority to seniority-cum-merit, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Thursday directed the university to make appointments as per earlier rules.

While cancelling promotion of many teachers who were promoted to associate professor’s post by applying the new criteria of seniority-cum-merit, a division bench comprising Justice Atul Chandurkar and Justice Vinay Joshi allowed all five petitioners’ prayers.

“Since it has been observed that the manner in which respondents were promoted as associate professor is not as per law, we’ve no hesitation in setting aside the promotion of the respondent-teachers in agricultural botany, agronomy, agriculture economics,” the bench held, while disposing of pleas by petitioners — Amrapali Akhare, Manish Deshmukh, Vanita Khobarkar, Sanjay Kakade and Shivaji Nagpure.

On the fate of other professors who too were promoted after following the new criteria, but were not made respondents in any of the petitions, the judges clarified that it was up to the university to take appropriate steps as per law.

On November 16, 2017, the university had issued a notification inviting proposals from eligible candidates for effecting promotions to associate professor’s post. On January 25, 2018, PDKV vice-chancellor issued orders granting temporary promotion to assistant professors bringing them to associate level for 11 months.

The university convened a meeting of its academic council on January 3, 2019, where issue of finalizing modalities for promotions came up for discussion. A resolution was passed which permitted to make modifications in the way selection committee would discharge its functions.

Quoting a letter of higher education director, it was decided that for effecting promotions, seniority of candidates and minimal educational qualifications along with academic performance index (API) points and confidential reports should be taken into the consideration.

The resolution was passed and forwarded to executive council which also cleared it without any change on January 7, 2019. Subsequently, on the recommendations of the selection board, which named the respondent-teachers as per new criteria, the VC issued promotion orders. This and the executive council decision was challenged by the petitioners.

All five petitioners through counsels Ashutosh Dharmadhikari, Bhanudas Kulkarni and Mohan Sudame contended that though their API score was better than the respondents, they were declared ineligible due to the change in criteria of merit-cum-seniority.

“As the executive council’s resolution has the effect of amending the relevant statues, and the exercise was done without complying with the procedure, the criteria adopted by the selection committee based on it is faulty,” the HC held while allowing all petitions.

126,['2/03/2020'],100 vendors sell wares amid Mandai metro station work,"Pune: The rehabilitation of over 100 stall owners from Mandai area is neither here nor there even as MahaMetro has started the preliminary work for an underground station that will come up close to the huge wholesale market.

The shifting of stalls is essential to make way for the station. MahaMetro officials have said they have already submitted a plan and prototypes of the stalls to be set up for the vendors to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).

The civic body is now expected to finalize the location for rehabilitation and the type of stalls suitable for the vendors. The proposal was sent four months ago and MahaMetro is waiting for a feedback from them.

“Mandai will be a crucial station in terms of commuter footfalls. It is expected to be high because of the market area. We have started preliminary work for the station. It will gain momentum only after the existing stalls are shifted to another location. We want the civic body to resolve the issue at the earliest to avoid any further delays,” MahaMetro officials said.

MahaMetro is going to set up stalls at a new location and the space that the vendors now occupy will be handed over for the station’s work.

Sources from the civic body said the issue has been under discussion since the last year. “The elected representatives from the area, civic and MahaMetro officials have jointly visited the area and have identified a few locations to rehabilitate the stalls. But the civic body has not reached any conclusion,” sources said.

Sanjay Shinde, a vendor, said some meetings were held a few days ago but there has been no progress in the proposal for their rehabilitation. A joint meeting between vendors and elected representatives can resolve the issue, he added.

A PMC-run multi-storied parking lot located near Mandai has been under consideration for the rehabilitation. Sources in the civic body said vendors were not keen on this location as it has a single entry point and not all stalls would be on the ground floor.

Local corporator Hemant Rasne, who is also the chairman of PMC’s standing committee, said the civic body was in favour of resolving the issue at the earliest to avoid any delays in the Metro work.

“Discussions on shifting vendors are underway at various levels. Some technical issues are required to be resolved for shifting of stalls. A breakthrough will come through soon,” he added.

Puri, who was in the city for the Asia Economic Dialogue, was informed about the passenger and flight movements. Sources in the airport said Puri was apprised of the issues, particularly related to the shortage of land the airport was facing.

“The minister told us to work towards increasing flight movements and passenger traffic at the airport,” a source at the airport said.

The Pune airport, being a defence airbase, has been struggling due to unavailability of land which has been hampering its expansion.

While the new terminal building is under construction and set to be commissioned by mid-next year, connectivity to the airport when it comes to proper roads and space for parking remain unsolved.

The airport is looking for around 34 acres of land mainly from private landowners and shifting of the existing international cargo terminal which will pave the way for seamless construction of the new terminal building.

Four water machines installed on premises

Four drinking water machines have been installed at the Pune airport for the passengers, who time and again have been complaining about the high cost of the bottled water provided at the facility, the airport’s director told TOI.

“Flyers can fill their containers from the machines for free,” the director said.

“These four machines have been installed in the departure, arrival and the security hold areas of the airport ,” the director added.

128,['2/03/2020'],MP to pay Rs 580 cr to pvt players without buying a single unit of power in 2021,"BHOPAL: The Madhya Pradesh government is likley to pay Rs 580.22 crore to private power companies in 2020-21 without buying a single unit of power. At least that’s what the annual revenue requirement (ARR) submitted before Madhya Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (MPERC) indicates.

Sources say that if this is plugged, then it will bring down the revenue gap of discoms by more than 25%, which means they would have to seek a lower power tariff hike.

As per the ARR submitted by discoms before MPERC for 2021, they have said that due to surplus power and after meeting the requirements of the state, they will “back down” power of producers. ‘Backing down’ means not buying the power that the state is entitled to under power-purchase agreement (PPA).

“After fully meeting the requirement of the state and selling power on the power exchange, the petitioners still have to partially back-down plants so as to save on the variable costs being incurred,” discoms have said in the ARR. In the same ARR, they have provided the amount of power available from each producer and the amount of power that they would back down in 2020-21.

Sources say discoms will ‘back down’ on four of the nine private power producers with which MP has signed PPAs — Torrent Power, BLA Power, Jaypee Bina Power and Essar Power STPS. This means, as per estimates for 2021, discoms will not purchase a single unit of power from these producers.

In the same ARR, discoms have informed that fixed charges of Rs 62.49 crore will be paid to Torrent Power, Rs 14.98 crore to BLA Power and Rs 504.75 crore to Jaypee Bina Power. The payment to Essar Power STPS hasn’t been revealed yet.

Power producers are paid in two ways — fixed charge and variable charge. If the charges are fixed, they will have to be paid even if the procurer doesn’t take any power. In the ARR, discoms say: “It needs to be highlighted that the payment of fixed charges is required to be made for such generators in accordance with PPAs even if the capacity is backed down.”

Asked about this, ACS-energy, Mohammed Suleman said, “ARR is based on assumptions and actual usage would be decided on demand and supply of power. Payment to any contractor is as per PPA and not decided by the regulator. Fixed charge concept is part of PPA and only the agreement can guide payments to any contractor, nothing outside of it.”

Energy minister Priyavrat Singh could not be contacted for comment, but on social media, he blamed the previous BJP government for bringing power discoms into loss. Tagging former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan , Priyavrat Singh wrote: “If there had been foresight, then discoms would not have been facing losses of Rs 47,000 crore.”

130,['2/03/2020'],Explosives detection needs solution: DRDO chairman,"Pune: DRDO chairman G Satheesh Reddy on Sunday said the detection of explosives has become the need of the hour in the wake of rising terror and Naxal attacks in the country.

The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) chief called upon the scientific institutes, academia and other departments to work together to find a “universal solution to detect explosives which are being used in varied forms by different inimical organizations against the security forces”.

He was speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the second national workshop on Explosive Detection at the High Energy Material Research Laboratory (HEMRL) in Pashan.

He said, “Whatever devices we have for explosive detection have their own limitations. They function in a particular weather condition and in a specific way. As a result, security forces have to rope in their personnel in these life-risking missions. If an explosive is buried in a culvert, it should be detected automatically. We need this kind of robust and versatile devices in our inventory to deliver desired results for the forces. To achieve these objectives, we need different institutes and research and development organisations to come together and work on such technologies.”

According to him, several unlawful organizations and anti-national elements have used explosives in multiple places in the country over the years. To combat that, a number of technologies were evolving for detection of explosives, he said.

“In a country like India, which is suffering from these attacks, both at the cross border and within, there has been continuous pressure from the nation and the security forces, agencies to develop various detection mechanism of these explosives. To fulfil the requirements, several labs and educational institutes have been trying to develop such devices and HEMRL Pune is one of them,” Reddy said.

He said continuous discussion with security agencies was a key factor in ensuring such devices are developed. “Security agencies and researchers need to discuss, deliberate and understand emerging technologies in this niche field on a regular basis. As a result, this kind of workshop is crucial where all stakeholders come together and discuss various challenges related to explosives,” he said.

He said, “Detection of explosive is an evolving field. As a result, various terrorist groups keep developing various mechanism in quick succession. This is a big challenge for us. We must have effective devices to tackle their new ways rapidly.”

Jayant Naiknavare, Deputy Inspector General of Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), Mumbai, called for the need to indigenously develop versatile explosive detection devices.

“If we get to know the type of explosives in time, it would help in establishing a link in investigations of various bomb blasts cases,” he said.

131,['2/03/2020'],KCB seeks ban on movement of heavy vehicles in Khadki bazaar area,"Pic by Mandar Deshpande

Pune: The Khadki Cantonment Board (KCB) has written to the city traffic police, seeking a ban on movement of heavy vehicles in the busy Khadki bazaar area.

The board has proposed diversion of heavy vehicles via old Pune–Mumbai highway to the poultry chowk and further till VIP Road, reaching up to Holkar bridge.

“We have had a detailed discussion on the matter with the traffic department officials in the past. The matter was also discussed with the deputy commissioner of police (traffic) during a recent meeting chaired by MP Girish Bapat. The stretch has become congested due to various reasons, one of them being plying of heavy vehicles. As a result, it is necessary to restrict vehicles to improve traffic situation in Khadki,” Pramod Kumar Singh, chief executive officer, KCB, told TOI.

A 5km stretch of Khadki Bazaar Road from the Haris bridge chowk to Holkar bridge in Khadki cantonment limit is prone to frequent traffic snarls. The bulk of the traffic, including heavy vehicles, take the route as it provides connectivity to Alandi Road via the Deccan College Chowk.

These vehicles are not allowed to ply on city roads between 9am and 9 pm, said a traffic department official.

“We are studying the proposal placed by the KCB authorities and a decision will be taken in the coming days,” additional commissioner of police Sanjay Shinde said.

The road is narrow and not adequate for movement of heavy vehicles. However, police inspector Sangeeta Patil of Khadki traffic division said a smaller number of heavy vehicles use the stretch. “Besides, our personnel divert heavy vehicles and cars from the Business Centre point to the highway. So, there is no movement of heavy vehicles and four-wheelers on the stretch,” Patil said.

He said that the KCB should provide four traffic wardens for managing vehicular movement in its jurisdiction.

“Presence of stray animals is a big issue as it creates hurdles in movement of vehicles in the KCB limits. We have been urging the KCB authorities to rope in wardens to drive away stray animals from the road,” Patil added.

Meanwhile, residents said that the traffic department and the KCB need to work in tandem to deal with the issue of traffic congestion.

“The traffic flow starts from morning due to the vegetable bazaar on the stretch. Vehicles are parked haphazardly on the road, leading to traffic congestion. The KCB and the traffic department need to resolve the issue. During evening, the situation turns even worse,” said Vikram Salvi, a KCB resident.

132,['2/03/2020'],Getting bubble-top cans may become tougher in city,"Trichy: With the packaged drinking water production units in the state continuing their indefinite strike for the past three days, the city residents began to experience a shortage of packaged drinking water. The water extraction units seeking relaxation from the state government to operate borewells in the groundwater depleted blocks have ceased their operations, affecting the supply of water.

Sources said that 15 companies are in the business of extracting groundwater for commercial purpose of which only a handful of companies have the mandatory licenses. Ahead of the PWD groundwater officials sealing 23 illegal packed drinking water units in the district that were operating without a license, the packaged drinking water units had suspended their operations. The units sought relaxation for extracting groundwater for commercial purpose as the GO 142 issued by the state government in 2014 calls for a complete ban on extracting groundwater in blocks that have over-exploited groundwater sources. As per the GO, around 23 units out of more than 30 packaged water units were closed in the district. The operators sought the state government to allow the existing operators to stay in business, while they agreed to prevent new players from extracting groundwater in the affected blocks. Registering their protest, all the 15 companies supplying 20-litre water cans in the city have stopped their operations.

The city consumes 50,000-60,000 cans of water (20 litres) per day and the cans are distributed by 15 firms through dealers across the city. The dealers said that they have completely exhausted their inventory as the demand has shot up. ""As summer is setting in, people are demanding more water cans, but we do not have stock,"" R Manoharan, a packaged water can dealer, said.

Since PWD officials are to submit the actions taken in closing the illegal water units before the Madras high court on March 3, protest by the drinking water units is likely to continue for the next few days. ""The state government should make relaxations in the GO to permit the existing packaged water can operators to function. Till then, our protest will continue,"" T Muthuselvan, managing partner of Aandavan and Sons Water Company, said.

The car’s driver Kiran Kamble (29) of Dattawadi lodged an FIR with the Deccan Gymkhana police. On Saturday, a team of the news channel went to the Deccan area around 1.30pm. Two of the them got down near Gokhale Chowk, while Kamble was sitting in the car. The camera bag, bag of mics and live recording unit were kept on the back seat. “An unidentified man walking on the footpath indicated to Kamble that something was lying outside the car. He did not get down from the car but rolled down the window glass to check what was lying down,” an officer from the Deccan Gymkaha police said.

“When the two team members returned to the car they were shocked to see the bags missing. Kamble did not know anything about it,” the officer said. After checking the CCTV camera footages, the police found that the man’s accomplice had stolen two bags from the parked car. Later, two more joined them. “The gang changed autorickshaws twice so that no one could trace their trail,” the officer said.

Laptops worth Rs21,000 stolen from vehicle

Unidentified men used a similar modus to steal two laptops worth Rs21,000 from a parked car on Shankarsheth Road on Saturday. The complainant had gone for a meeting, while the driver was waiting in the car. “A person told the driver that a Rs100 note were lying near the car. As soon as the driver got down from the car, the suspect stole the bag,” an officer from Khadki police said.

Cops suspect gang is from Tamil Nadu

An officer from the crime branch said police were suspecting a gang from Tamil Nadu was behind these thefts. “The suspects stay in a lodge near the Pune railway station. Stealing bags from cars after distracting the driver is their modus. After committing few thefts in a row, they return to their native place,” the officer said.

Trichy City Corporation installed two water ATMs on West Boulevard Road near the old passport office complex and at Main Guard Gate, Singarathope. It was planned as a public-private partnership (PPP) model, in which the civic body will provide space and facilitate a borewell for the water ATMs to function under reverse osmosis (RO) mechanism. The private player has to install and maintain the water treatment mechanism. To collect one litre of water in a bottle, the user has to pay Rs 1 while it is Rs 7 for collecting water in a 20-litre can. Users have to avail QR card for the payment. Though the work on the water ATMs was completed at an estimated cost of Rs 5 lakh each in November 2019, the facilities are yet to open for public use. “Refilling 20-litre can for Rs 7 will benefit a lot of low-income group people. The facilities should open soon,” K Suresh, a resident of Woraiyur, said.

When contacted, a corporation official acknowledged that water ATMs are not available for the public to collect treated water. However, the official refused to divulge the reason for the inordinate delay in opening the water ATMs.

Vinayak from Core Strength demonstrated the dance form to kids and adults alike. Traditional Arabic music dominated the scene as people revelled in the delight of learning something new.

""I have watched belly-dancing sessions on YouTube and I was amazed at how beautiful the dance form is in reality. Because of this workshop, I also discovered how difficult it is to perform belly-dancing, because it is so methodical an dprecise,” said Shruti Roy, a local resident.

For those seeking more of a gym experience in comparison to dancing, Core Strength had a fitness zone with gym equipment as well as instructors demonstrating freehand exercises.

138,['2/03/2020'],"Craters in Ibrahimpura, Moti Masjid road a motorist’s nightmare","Bhopal: A mammoth pothole, large enough to engulf a medium-sized car, is making it extremely difficult to drive through Ibrahimpura area in the state capital. Not far away, Moti Masjid road, which is part of the BRT corridor, awaits proper repairs for over three years now.

“The pothole is next to a turn. If unaware, most people miss the pothole in the middle of the road. As a result, in the last week, there have been four accidents due to the poor state of the road,” said Ismail Khan, a local businessman. One of the injured was rushed to a nearby hospital, a 108 ambulance paramedic confirmed.

Ibrahimpura and Moti Masjid road witness very heavy traffic activity. On an average, around 3 to 5 lakh vehicles pass through the area each working day. “Ongoing protests against CAA and NRC are taking place in the area. It has made the drive through more complicated. Road accident could trigger a much worse reaction, given the potholes and encroachments in the area,” he added.

Last year, after the monsoon, the state government had declared that all roads would be fixed by November 2019.

Further ahead, the road connecting Moti Masjid area to Kamla Park, has been laid and dug at least five times in the past few months. Public works department (PWD), Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) and National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) have taken no responsibility for the potholed road.

“BMC has completed the task of fixing the area which was dug for pipeline leakage. Other section of the road from Reth Ghat is managed by PWD and some section is managed by NHAI,” said BMC zonal officer, Rakesh Singh. Over the last week, for laying of pipeline, the road stretch has been dug again. Traffic moving from Moti Masjid to Kamla Park would be affected, BMC officials said.

Following a 2014 practice, the district administration is working on a proposal to carry out a third party survey of roads in the city. The assessment would cover roads maintained by PWD, CPA and the BMC. A similar exercise in 2014 exposed claims by road development and maintenance agencies.

MUMBAI: The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is likely to reverse yet another decision taken by its predecessor — the cow-protection scheme Govardhan Govansh Seva Kendra (GGSK) launched by the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP-Sena alliance after a beef ban came into effect in the state. The scheme intended to boost infrastructure at cow sheds (gaushalas), especially set up to conserve, protect and develop cattle and progeny.

Dairy and animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar told TOI that the current government is taking a review of the scheme.

“We have not reached any conclusions yet. The department has been asked to review the scheme and prepare a report on how much funds have been spent, the impact of the scheme and other details,” said Kedar.

A senior official saidthat GGSK funds may not be released from now on as neither Congress nor NCP — constituents of the MVA, along with Shiv Sena — is interested to go ahead with the scheme. A minister said that the Uddhav Thackeray-led government is not in a mood to continue with the scheme also because most gaushala functionaries are linked to RSS.

Bhopal: A ‘waste to art’ installation to foster the participation of public and various other stakeholders so as to promote a sustainable world for curbing the plastic menace was unveiled at the Boat Club on Sunday. The initiative has been undertaken in association with Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC).

“Four months after our not-for-profit group started a campaign to collect plastic from city residents, this art work is to create awareness over ill effects plastic and motivate commitment at the highest level for adopting sustainable living practices,” said Zeeshan Khan, representative of the Plastic Donation Centre.

The plastic used on the globe-like structure is from what he describes as plastic donation by citizens of the state capital. The collection centres are at Moti Masjid, Minto Hall and 10 Number Market parking.

The initiative began on October 2 last year. Since then, about 4 tonne of plastic waste has been collected.

The long term idea is to sell the plastic waste and recycle it, thereby generating resource for more climate friendly initiatives. Eight rag pickers were involved in creating the current art work under supervision of an artist, he added.

Climate Warrior and actor Bhoomi Pednekar unveiled the installation at Boat Club. Bhopal collector Tarun Pitodhe, DIG Irshad Wali and BMC commissioner B Vijay Datta and others were present.

The art work is made using the plastic waste, which was collected at the plastic donation centres in Bhopal. “This is an attempt to start a dialogue with the people who work tirelessly to save the environment and highlight the crisis that we find ourselves in due to climate change,” tweeted Pednekar.

The waste to art artwork was made under the guidance of artist Wajid Khan. The team said, its artwork was made using 500 kgs of waste plastic and also trained rag pickers for making such art works in the future.

141,['2/03/2020'],"Pope Francis: Jailed for 20 years, rape-convict Kerala vicar defrocked by Pope Francis","Fr Robin Vadakkumchery

KOZHIKODE: Pope Francis has dismissed Fr Robin Vadakkumchery , who was last year convicted of raping and impregnating a minor girl, from priesthood.

The Thalassery Pocso court had in February 2019 sentenced Vadakkumchery, former vicar of St Sebastian Church at Neendunoki in Kannur, to 20 years in prison for raping and impregnating a minor girl.

Catholic diocese of Mananthavady PRO Fr Jose Kocharakkal on Sunday said Pope Francis has dismissed Vadakkumchery from priesthood on the basis of the report submitted by ‘Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith’ in Rome on December 5, 2019.

“From now on, he won’t have any priestly rights and duties and he will no more be addressed as Fr Robin Vadakkumchery. He will be known as Robin Vadakkumchery only,” Fr Kocharakkal said.

The dismissal of a priest in the Catholic Church from the clerical state is a permanent measure which is reserved for the most serious offenses. Only the Pope has the power to dismiss a priest from clerical state.

The Catholic diocese of Mananthavady had suspended Vadakkumchery from priestly duties on February 27, 2017, after the incident came to light.

“The congregation for the doctrine of faith in Rome began the procedures for dismissal of Robin from priesthood in June 2019 and based on their report, Pope Francis has dismissed Robin Vadakkumchery from priesthood and all its rights and duties on December 5,” the statement issued by the Mananthavady diocese said.

The diocese handed over the decree last month to Vadakkumchery, who is currently serving sentence at Kannur Central jail, and an official communication that the decree was signed and accepted was sent to Rome, thereby completing the procedure for dismissal.

The case involving sexual offence against the minor girl by a priest had come to light when Childline in Kannur got an anonymous call in February 2017, saying that a minor girl had delivered a baby in Christu Raj Hospital in Koothuparamba, run by the church, on February 7, 2017, and that the newborn had been immediately shifted to Holy Infant Mary’s Foundling Home at Vythiri in Wayanad.

A police probe revealed that Vadakkumchery had sexually abused the minor girl. The priest was arrested on February 28 from Nedumbassery airport at Kochi while trying to flee to Canada.

In the course of the trial, the rape survivor and all main prosecution witnesses, including her parents, turned hostile but the prosecution secured a conviction by managing to produce the girl’s original birth certificate that proved she was a minor when she was sexually abused by the priest.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

142,['2/03/2020'],Amnesty scheme launched for property owners to secure completion certificate,"Aurangabad: The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has announced an amnesty scheme for residents who wish to secure completion certificates for their buildings in the city. Officials said residents can avail a discount of 25% on penalties under the scheme that will run from March 1 to March 31.

The AMC took this decision after a meeting held with architects in the city on Friday. The architects suggested certain measures to simplify the application process for securing the completion certificates.

The drive was also initiated to increase revenue and to ensure structures are built according to standards set by the civic body. It is hoped that the amnesty scheme will encourage residents and commercial property owners to get their real estate regularised.

The meeting, held on Friday at the Babasaheb Ambedkar Research Centre, also discussed the scope of the amnesty scheme. R S Mahajan, the assistant director of town planning at AMC; deputy engineer Sanjay Kombde; senior architect Ramesh Nagpal; president of Architects Association of Aurangabad Sunil Bhale; secretary Swapnil Pargaonkar; Deepak Deshpande; Ajay Thakur; Manish Kale and Miling Vadekar attended the meeting.

Participants also discussed the documents that would be required for the certification and the discount of 25%. It was stated that the completion certificate is an important document for residents — just like Aadhaar is for an individual. It was highlighted by the experts that completion certificates would ensure development and amenities in a city are better planned.

The architects said a complicated process often discourages residents from securing permissions and certificates. The AMC officials said measures would be put in place to simplify the process further.

The architects, as well as the civic officials, then urged residents to make the most of the month-long amnesty scheme.

143,['2/03/2020'],Cement roads develop cracks within a month in Cidco areas,"Aurangabad: The civic administration’s claim that the cement roads that they are constructing across the city will not wear and tear for 30 years, albeit with proper maintenance, has fallen flat as cracks have already developed on the roads in Cidco N-3, N-4 and N-5 constructed less than a month ago.

The state government had sanctioned Rs 100 crore to the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) for the construction of 30 cement roads in different areas of the city.

The civic body had given the tender of the project to four contractors.

The works on the stretch from the TV Centre to Central Naka kickstarted the road construction project on February 4, 2019. The road from Chistiya Chowk to Avishkar Chowk was completed just three weeks ago. The cement road has also been finished with stripes drawn with thermoplastic paint. However, the new road has already developed cracks. The situation is no better on the cement road in Cidco N-3 and N-4.

Several activists and public representatives had raised concerns about the quality of the road works. In a written complaint directed to the municipal commissioner in January, Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel had stated that several residents had complained that the works being carried out were of sub-standard quality. Jaleel’s allegations were put to rest by AMC’s executive engineer and in-charge of the road construction project Hemant Kolhe. He said that the project management consultant, the third-party inspector and the civic administration was inspecting the work being done by the contractors.

Activist Kishor Pathak said that the AMC was spending 10 times more on cement roads than tar roads. “The civic body should see to it that proper curing is done before the road is made open for use. This is not the first instance of roads developing cracks. A few years ago, the cement road constructed at Shivajinagar and Cidco N-2 also developed cracks. Clearly, the contractors have done a shoddy work and the civic body is looking the other way,” he said.

Activists and residents are already concerned about the new roads that will be constructed from the corpus of Rs152 crore approved by the state government.

When contacted, mayor Nandkumar Ghodele said, “It is a serious concern if cracks have developed on the newly constructed roads. I will speak to the municipal commissioner and ask him to take action. If the contractor is at fault, then the AMC can blacklist them.”

145,['2/03/2020'],Guv seeks report on complaint by syndicate member of alleged irregularity in teacher appointment notification,"Kozhikode: Governor Arif Mohammed Khan has asked for a report from Calicut University on a complaint by a syndicate member on alleged irregularity in the notification issued by the varsity to fill up the existing teaching vacancies and the non-acceptance of his note of dissent he had raised on the matter at the syndicate meeting.

The governor, also the chancellor, has asked the vice-chancellor to submit a report on the petition of syndicate member Rasheed Ahammed P. The syndicate member complained that the minutes of the syndicate meeting on December 30, 2019, had resolved to approve the subcommittee report and notification for filling of vacancies in the posts of professors/associate professors/assistant professors while there was no such report placed in the syndicate nor was it appended with the minutes.

“The purported and non-existing report was recorded in the minutes only to vindicate the action of the vice-chancellor and the syndicate to publish the vacancy notification dated December 31, 2019,” the petition said.

Ahammed had also said in the letter that the vacancies were notified as per the order of the high court in a case (WP(C) 9785 of 2015) without specifying the reservation turns to be followed while making recruitments. He said the vice- chancellor has deliberately kept a blind on the other part of the same court order which mandates the university to work out the technicalities of the reservation turns before the notification regarding the recruitment is published.

“As no ‘sub-committee report’ was placed in the meeting held on December 30 as wrongly in the minutes, I strongly objected to this and wanted it either to be corrected or my dissent note to be added to the minutes. But when the final minutes were issued, there was no mention of my dissent note or my objections to the agenda item. When I demanded a copy of the said report, they didn't have the copy of the same and hence they could not supply it to me,” Rasheed said in the petition.

He has urged the governor to direct the vice-chancellor to record the dissent to the agenda item regarding teacher appointments and also to ensure transparency in the recruitment process to obviate the possibility of corruption and nepotism.

Power discom disconnected power of the BMC offices after civic body payment was delayed.

“Power supply is expected to be restored completely by Monday evening. Terms of payments with the discom have been in place since January. Almost 80% of the payment due for February was paid, rest would be deposited by Monday,” said the BMC official. He cited a recent meeting between BMC and the power discom officials.

BMC owes the discom about Rs 200 crore. The dues are expected to be cleared within the next few months. BMC was on target to clear it dues in January.

Electricity bill for water supply and street lights account for most of the dues, going by BMC records. Last year, the BMC power bill increased by almost Rs 30 crore, owing to pressure to supply water to the state capital during a water crises. Surcharge of non-payment by the BMC is running into double digit, close to Rs 10 crore, said sources.

For now building permission office at Fatehgarh, water works office at Shymala Hills and few other ward offices continue without power.

BMC senior officials ruled out any retaliation against the power discom. Some ward level officials had hinted at cutting off water supply of the discom offices, citing their water cess dues were unpaid.

Building permission, server was functioning normally on Sunday. However, without electricity office computers are not functional. It would affect work of the building permission department. Much of BMC service is on enterprise solutions software which also links with TNCP, said a zone level official.

Sources said that BMC has not been able to recover Rs 36 crore from the electricity company for ground rent of power poles and transformers and about Rs 2 crore from property tax. More over BMC surcharge from cable and other services using street light poles is pegged in the crores, sources said.

NAGPUR: It’s a moment of pride and satisfaction for anyone, when their work for humanity is acknowledged and appreciated. Even as citizens eagerly await this year’s list of Nagpur Heroes , TOI explores how the title has affected the life of last year's heroes.

Bimla and Avinash Deoskar, the mountaineer couple having endurance to train the youth, believes that this recognition has helped with the support of government of Maharashtra .

“Any award or title comes with a lot of appreciation and responsibilities. We were glad that our efforts were recognized by the Times of India. Ever since the win, we managed to gather more youngsters and draw their passion into mountaineering,” said Avinash.

“The honour was prestigious as it was a Times of India initiative. People now recognize us and know our story, which is a great feeling,” said Bimla.

Iqbal Kashmiri, who received the award for his yeoman service in training the youth in football, shared his joy on becoming the executive member of the Western Indian Football Association (WIFA).

“The appreciation that has poured in from various parts of the country is overwhelming. People who didn't even know me called and greeted for the achievement. I am happy that more youngsters look forward to building their future in football,” said Kashmiri.

Tanveer Mirza — who works in the sphere of rural and social development — expressed his thoughts on how the award has impacted his work and life.

“This recognition has made a huge impact on my personal and social life. Our NGO Yashodhara, and the cause for which we are striving hard became more popular after this. May it be our social and environmental awareness programs or the campaign for entrepreneurship development — all got a different credibility with the Nagpur Heroes tag,” said Mirza.

Ritu Malhotra, Pratik Malhotra and Pratik Harde, the innovative engineer trio from the city who co-founded the start-up ‘Eventuate Innovations’, was ecstatic with the response after the win.

“Our product got placed on several key government platforms. Niti Aayog has appreciated the concept and has instructed the health ministry to prevent spread of virus and bacteria in hospitals through this technology,” said Ritu.

“The product has shown spread and presence throughout the country and abroad. It is showing very good results after the recognition as one of the Nagpur Heroes,” added Pratik Malhotra.

For Vishnu Manohar, star chef and a world record holder, this award opened the doors for his long-pending dream to open a restaurant in the United States of America (USA).

“It was very special. I was approached to open a restaurant in USA, and people got to know about me after the win. It has been six months since the restaurant opened, and it is running well,"" said Manohar.

The girls are among six candidates selected in the Bharatanatyam category from Maharashtra.

A student of dance academy Dhyas Performing Arts, 12-year-old Vidisha Vembakkam is being trained by Ketki Nevpurkar in Bharatnatyam for the last seven years.

Vidisha wants to represent India’s cultural art form on an international level.

Meanwhile, 12-year-old Ishani Kulkarni, who has been training at the dance academy Devmudraa under V Soumyasri, has also secured the prestigious CCRT scholarship this year.

Soumyasri said that it is rare to have two girls from the city claim the prestigious scholarship.

The girls had to undergo a rigorous selection process as a part of which they had to perform in front of a panel of judges and also answer questions asked by them.

Of the total 564 students selected for this scholarship award in various art forms, Vidisha and Ishani are among the six students selected for this scholarship in classical dance form Bharatanatyam and the only two from Maharashtra.

Under the scheme, the CCRT will bear the fee paid to the awardee’s teacher of the art form until the person turns 20.

Sources said that Dara Singh, who was passing through the air concourse under construction at the Habibganj railway station, slipped his foot and fell on the railway track 30 feet below. While falling from such height he also got scorched severely by Over Head Electric (OHE). He is undergoing treatment at Bansal Hospital, where his condition is said to be critical.

The incident took place at 8.45 am on Sunday. This is the first major accident during the redevelopment work of Habibganj railway station. The task of assembling the air concourse of the station was given to a private agency of Indore. Officials said Dara Singh, a resident of Indore is an employee of the company.

Eyewitnesses said that Dara Singh was not wearing any safety belt or helmet at the time of the incident.

Bansal Path-way Habibganj Pvt Ltd project manager Abu Asif said that the assistant foreman was moving from the top of the single girder to the other side because it is a matter of investigation as 80% of the air concourse is covered to go to the other side through which one can easily go to the other side. “He is undergoing treatment at Bansal hospital,” said Asif.

151,['2/03/2020'],"On the sands of Miramar beach, India’s underprivileged have different life goals","Panaji: As a child, Anish Kumar remembers how rowdies from his locality constantly invaded his house and robbed money from his parents. Struggling to make ends meet themselves, there seemed to be no way out for his parents in Neelasandra, a residential area in Bengaluru which is inhabited by migrants.

Dotted with four huge slums, most of the youth at Neelasandra are school dropouts. They take to crime and alcoholism, but Anish had a different obsession — football . The 19-year-old is quite good at the game and believes it’s only a matter of time before he realises his dream of making it to the Indian team.

From the slums of Neelasandra to the Indian team would be quite a story, and it all begins at the SPN National Inclusion Cup at Miramar for Anish.

The National Inclusion Cup, organised by the Nagpur-based Slum Soccer , is a one of its kind event that brings together children from slums across the country and those underprivileged , trying to change their lives through football.

“Life is a constant struggle back home. With football, things can get better. It’s so different here. We get proper food, clean water to drink and a place to stay. I just want to do the best I can,” said Anish, who cycles 3km every day to fetch water from a tap.

Anish is not alone.

The National Inclusion Cup, now in its 17th edition and started by professor Vijay Barse, a retired sports teacher from Nagpur, has attracted 50 teams and over 500 players, all battling for a place in the Indian team for the Homeless World Cup in Finland later this year. While Anish has moved out of Bengaluru for the first time — apart from a football trip to Mysuru — and made the overnight bus journey to Goa, Junaid Ahmed Laway had to endure five days of travel just to get here.

“I can see that the journey has been worth it. Life can be an adventure and I want to see the world outside Kashmir,” said Junaid, a 21-year old who is dreaming of catching the selectors’ eye and seeing the world in all its glory.

Hailing from Pampore, famous as Kashmir’s ‘Saffron Town’ for its precious high-grade spice, Junaid has heard of a “beautiful world”, but doesn’t really know what it looks like beyond his neighbourhood. On a small ground, he’s seen children of his age kick the ball around and it’s this beautiful sport that can now become his passport to the world.

Kashmir has done well here, winning four of their five games, losing only to Meghalaya in penalties, with Junaid among the goals.

Kajal Shiriange has a different goal. Having lost her father a decade ago, the 21-year-old girl from Gondia district in Maharashtra has seen her mother struggle all her life, sweeping floors at railway stations and godowns, so that they don’t go to bed hungry.

“I want to help my mother. I know if I become a good footballer, I can possibly get a government job and then ease the burden which my mother has been carrying all her life,” said Kajal.

Life has been tough, and cruel, for the Shirianges, who don’t have a house which they can call their own and live with their supportive grandmother.

“When this tournament ends, not just me but all of us will be in tears. We’ve never seen anything like this before,” said Shiriange, raving about the bread and jam she was fortunate to have for breakfast on Sunday morning.

Nobody has had it easy here. At Miramar, the goals for India’s underprivileged are not quite the same.

152,['2/03/2020'],Jaggery-honey mix to match chocolate syrup? Eat-right advocate innovates with the traditional,"Playing with Indian food and spices, Rohit Dubepatil has been creating healthy products with an international ... Read More

As a proponent of healthy eating and living, Rohit Dubepatil cringes when he sees the roadside 'batata wada' vendor using a single batch of oil for up to seven fries in his ‘kadhai’. Worse, he will later filter the final tar-black oil and mix it with regular palm oil to create a new stock for further use.

We fry our foods at an average temperature of 250-300 degrees Celsius, which does not permit us to go beyond three fries, says Dubepatil. Having travelled the world, he says even the poorest of African countries have some regulations regarding frying in oil. India has none, and we end up with some of the worst fats in our food.

Dubepatil forayed into the world of healthy food items with his biotechnologist wife in 2013 after doing two courses on patents at the National Chemical Laboratory and the Tata Chemicals’ innovation centre, both in Pune. His first focus was good fats and what could better exemplify the key to heart health than antioxidant-rich olive oil.

Now, Dubepatil believes olive oil enjoys a somewhat glorified status, pointing out that our coconut oil delivers equally good fats. But the production and marketing of olive oil in places like Spain and Italy sets it apart from other oils, contributing to its standing. So he got into importing olive oil though the pitch was queered by fly-by-night businessmen who had no qualms selling their adulterated stocks at cheaper rates. “There are only around 10 serious olive oil brands across the world and they are all busy battling manufacturers who adulterate their oils. We had to bleed initially to stay afloat,” he says.

Dubepatil eventually tasted success, notching a healthy turnover for three successive years. Then his venture crashlanded in 2016 after the government hiked customs duty, the rupee weakened against the euro and the drought in Spain and Italy hit the olive harvest hard. Like most first-generation entrepreneurs, he had not paid attention to risk mitigation.

While picking up the pieces, Dubepatil realised the need to diversify. Along with olive oil, he began bringing in almond oil and also cherry tomato sauce. From within the country, he was procuring and packaging peas from Uttarakhand and sweet corn from Pune itself. But his long-term goal was to make healthy, sugar- and salt-free products using traditional Indian foods and spices and give them an international appeal.

Dubepatil cracked the code, as it were, by working on a combination of jaggery , honey and olive oil. These three, if heated in a specific way, at a specific temperature and for a specific duration makes for a product that replicates the taste and texture of sugar. To this combination he added vitamin E, the only fat closest to one’s sebum (oily secretion of the skin glands), and a seven-spice ayurvedic mix.

So, Dubepatil now has an indigenous jaggery caramel to compete with the ubiquitous, fancy chocolate syrup. The challenge for him was to liquefy the jaggery, give it a two-year shelf life and texturise the caramel to match the classiness imparted by cocoa in chocolate syrup. He has also turned the humble ‘shengdana chutney’ into a paste-like spiced peanut butter , whipped up a naturally-sweet plum jam for children and designed an apple-carrot-beetroot concoction which gives a good haemoglobin spike and keeps hunger pangs at bay. The tea-time snack on his table is the protein-rich ‘makhana’ (foxnut), coming in the ‘thecha’, gunpowder, chaat and barbecue varieties to cater to different palates across the country.

The quest for good ingredients has exposed Dubepatil to the huge food basket that India is. He is particularly intrigued by the numerous types of jaggery in the country — almost as many as there are states. He says this variety augurs well for his caramel as chefs can have more than one version of the syrup for their spreads. And he’s waiting, rather amusingly, for one five-star hotel chef to deliver on his promise of coating every post-meal ‘paan’ with his caramel.

The mishap took place around 4.40 am when goods train laden with coal from the Amlori mine in MP was heading towards Uttar Pradesh and collided with an empty goods train some 7 kms from Singrauli. The track where the accident took place is managed by the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and is used for transporting coal.

“Three people including a loco pilot, assistant loco pilot and a pointsman were died in the incident,” NTPC Rihand, spokesperson, Prashank Chandra told TOI.

The deceased have been identified pointsman Ramlakhan Bais, 29, loco pilot Rasheed Ahmed and assiatnt loco pilot Mandeep Kumar, 27, both hailing from Uttar Pradesh, Singrauli's additional superintendent of police Pradeep Shende said. Their bodies were pulled out from the engine, he said.

“A rake which unloaded coal in the NTPC plant was returning while another carrying coal to the plant collided near a crossover point. It was not a head-on collision, but the train carrying coal hit the rear wagon of the empty train as it tried to cross over to the other track,” he said.

“An enquiry has been ordered and it will take in consideration all safety issues,” he said.

After the accident, several wagons of one of the trains and an engine jumped off the tracks. Initially, it appears the accident might have occurred either due to an error on part of the drivers or because of some fault in signaling, he said.

The mishap has not affected rail passenger traffic as it occurred on the track exclusively used by the NTPC to ferry coal for its power plants, the official said.

Meanwhile, East Central Railway's chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar in a statement said the Indian Railways has nothing to do with the accident. He said the accident took place in the Merry Go Round (MGR) system completely owned and operated by NTPC, Rihand. “NTPC will investigate the matter,” he added.

155,['2/03/2020'],Well-planned protests can stop govt implementing NRC/CAA: Teesta,"Mangaluru: Systematic protests in an organised manner, signature campaigns and meeting elected representatives with delegates will stop the Union government from implementing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR), opined rights activists Teesta Setalvad.

Teesta was delivering a talk on CAA/NRC and NPR jointly organised by We The People and Citizens Forum for Mangaluru Development on Sunday.

She said that the proposed Acts not only target the Muslim community, but also adivasis, dalits, migrant labourers, nomadic tribes among others. “If the ongoing protests are not done in a right manner, they won’t bring about any good result,” she pointed out.

“With the move of implementing CAA, the government has shown how it is indulging in divide and rule. People have come out on the streets protesting the hidden agenda of the BJP government. Such fights against this unconstitutional move of the government should be always alive.”

Teesta questioned the NPR exercise and said place and date of birth of one’s parents was not asked when it was done under the UPA government but the same being is asked by the current government. “We are not opposing the census as it is needed to count the total population of the country and to provide government facilities. But, while UPA government had done NPR exercise, the place and date of birth of one’s parents were not asked. Why is it being asked now?” she questioned. Of the total of population of India, only about 52% would have birth certificates and the rest would not have such documents. “If so, how the government will give citizenship on the basis of birth certificates? It is a challenge to the people of our country,” she said.

In Assam, which has a population of 3.2 crore, has spent Rs 1,220 crore for implementing NRC. It will cost Rs 55,000 crore to implement it in all states. “Instead of addressing unemployment and others issues of the country, why the government is spending such huge sum for unnecessary work?” she questioned, stressing that it will be a big blow to the economy of the country.

157,['2/03/2020'],Shacks trade thatched roofs for neon lights to lure visitors,"Panaji: With cut-throat competition driving the need to lure tourists by any means necessary, beach shacks in the state have undergone drastic changes.

From their humble beginnings of just two or three tables under a thatched roof, present-day shacks, with their eye-catching gimmicks, bear no resemblance to their spartan ancestors.

The Beach Shack Policy still mandates that shacks have to be set up with eco-friendly material, but today’s shacks cannot be executed merely with bamboo poles and palm leaves, says a shack operator.

“With unseasonal rains, the roofs of our structures require a layer of plastic or other waterproof material for protection, though the outer layer will be made of palm leaves,” he said, pointing out that this further adds to his expenditure.

The cost of setting up a shack without any frills will be nothing less than Rs 2 lakh, he said. “The cost will increase further if an operator chooses to spring for stylish interior decor,” he said.

In such cases, he said the cost will climb to Rs 3 to 5 lakh, or even higher.

The material used is mostly imported, and bamboo is not commonly used. “Some use pine wood as well as eucalyptus poles for the structure while the base is made from engineered or hard wood or plywood,” said another shack operator.

While the materials used in building shacks is reused the following tourist season, there are recurring costs involved that cannot be avoided. “Some materials get damaged while dismantling and they cannot be re-used,” he said.

With incidents of seawater rising and entering shacks becoming increasingly frequent, he said that shack operators are now compelled to fortify their temporary structures, and many now choose to have raised wooden platforms as the base. “So, they are forced to use metal poles, though it is not allowed,” he said.

While a mid-sized shack used to have three or four rows of seating with four to five tables per row, today, each operator has to stock many more tables, chairs and deck beds.

The latest addition are tents or cabana-style dining arrangements that dot the shore in the evenings. When the sun sets, the beach begins to resemble a carnival, or takes on a Vegas-like appearance with neon signs and flashing disco lights the shacks install to lure tourists looking to party.

158,['2/03/2020'],"Hello, world! City welcomes 25 newborns on leap day","Vijayawada: Once every four years, people born on February 29 get the chance to celebrate their birthdays. This year, around 25 births were reported in the city on leap day even as their parents acknowledged the significance of the day.

The maternity ward at the Old Government Hospital registered nine births on Saturday, out of which five were male and four female. K Revathi, a resident of the city, who delivered a baby boy at GGH said she was happy that she had given birth on leap day. “This is a very special day for me. My son has been born on a special day and his birthday will always be special as he will celebrate it once every four years. We had never planned to have a Caesarean section ( C-section ), but it happened with God’s grace,” she said.

On the other hand, authorities of the health wing said that while many parents show an interest in C-section deliveries on special and auspicious days, most chose not to opt for a C-section on leap day. “A birthday is a very special day for everyone. Children celebrate it in a grand manner but babies born on leap day will miss this opportunity. So we have postponed the C-section to another day,” said K Nageswari, an expecting mother from Madhuranagar.

Health officials also said that on average, the number of deliveries on leap year decrease in comparison to other days. “Around 120 to 130 births are registered across the district on an average per day. But the number is low on leap day. We are estimating around 100 births as per the records available with us,” said Dr TSR Murthy, district medical and health officer (DMHO).

The birth registrar at the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) said that the actual number of births on any particular day is known only after 21 days. Hospitals register births online based on the Aadhaar number of the parents.

160,['2/03/2020'],Greens urge govt to safeguard biodiversity in Western Ghats,"Mangaluru: Prominent biodiversity hotspots of the Western Ghats are affected due to increased human activities, especially felling of trees, hunting and tourism, resulting in loss of natural habitats for king cobras. Over 30 lakh trees, some of them as old as 150 years, were cut for various human activities in Western Ghats. Parisara Sammelana, a convention for environment held on Sunday under the aegis of National Environment Care Federation (NECF) at the Tree Park on the Tannirbavi Beach resolved to urge the government to protect and improve the environment and safeguard forests and wildlife as envisaged in Article 48A of the Constitution.

The convention held in the form of a people’s court took up trials of 36 cases pertaining to environment. Environmentalists from coastal and malnad regions, presented their cases at the event presided by noted human rights activist Dr Ravindranath Shanbhag.

Writer and activist Akilesh Chippali said that there is need for amendments for laws to prevent afforestation. “Over 30 lakh trees are chopped for various projects in the Western Ghats. Some of them were as old as 150 years,” he said.

Activist Yogish from Chikkamagaluru, presenting the case he is fighting, said king cobras in the Western Ghats have been losing their source of food due to human activities. Destruction of habitats through hunting, trekking and other activities have resulted in the loss of food source for the reptiles. Meanwhile, pollution of water also has also affected them, he added.

Environmentalist Kalavathi P said 9,580 cases were booked for vehicular pollution between 2005 and 2016 in the state and penalty to the tune of Rs 82 lakh was collected. However, the problem still persists since those vehicles are allowed to ply after the payment of penalty. “This is not a solution to the environmental issues we face today. The rules should be stricter that such vehicles should be seized and should not be allowed to play on the road,” she suggested.

A panel of advocates present at the programme extended their support to those who are fighting for the cause of environment. Padma Shri awardee and Halakki tribal folk singer Sukri Bommagowda, another Padma award winner Tulsi Gowda, who is known as the ‘encyclopedia of forest’ for her vast knowledge of plants and herbs and activist Diyego Bastyav Siddi expressed their views.

NECF state secretary Shashidhar Shetty and member Dinesh Holla said that none of the officials from various government departments participated in the meet despite the organisers sending them invitations. “Our fight will continue till our demands for the protection of environment and wildlife are fulfilled,” Holla said.

“We had started the event five years back and have received a remarkable response from enthusiasts. People only need to know the date and venue and they make it a point to reach there on time,” the organisers said.

For the recent trip, participants reached the Sant Nivruttinath Samadhi Mandir in Trimbakeshwar by 8.30 am where the trustee of the temple, Jayant Gosavi, briefed them about the history of the temple.

“The samadhi (tomb) was built in 13th century, precisely in 1250. Since then it has evolved a lot and took the shape of the temple,” he said.

From there, the trip moved towards the Brahmagiri rest house which was built in 1913 for devotees to rest before continuing their journey to the top of the hill.

“We had to climb 500 stairs to reach the rest house. But, it was totally worth it. The two-storey rest house has good ventilation and continuous supply of water,” the organisers said.

The participants had the most enjoyable moment when they looked at the rectangular step-well behind the rest house. It is a century old Bawri (well) which has ample of water.

Gopinath Tidke, a participant, said, “I thank the organisers for organising such a wonderful event. I would like them to take us to such places more often.”

The walkathon was organised by Eventz by Sonali Dabak.

“Women have to face many violent acts but there are fewer crimes against women in the city as compared to other parts of the country. One of the reasons for this is women empowerment which happens due to the events like this,” he said.

He also appreciated the theme of the event which was “Me Fit = Family Fit” as such concept helps in maintaining the physical and mental health of women.

Nearly 3,000 women participated in the event and expressed their voices about womanhood.

“All of them celebrated womanhood and participated with enthusiasm. They brought their ideas and vision for a safe and healthy world for women to the streets,” said Sonali Dabak, organiser of the event.

The 3 km walkathon started from Suyojit Viridian Valley towards Makhmalabad, covering a stretch of one-and-a-half kilometre and back.

“We began with nearly 1,200 entries in 2017 which has now reached to 3,000 entries. The ‘Mother and Baby Walk’ category was the most interesting one where over 150 women brought their newborn children in strollers. Also, nearly 25 expecting mothers took part in the event,” Dabak told TOI.

Some women carried posters to express their views while others were dressed up to promote the environment. A lady displayed a costume with six hands showing how a woman can multi task while nursing a child.

The Aurangabad zilla parishad has also recorded around three-fold rise in applications against the total intake capacity till Saturday — the stipulated deadline for submitting applications.

Aurangabad district has received as many as 15,929 applications as against the declared cumulative intake capacity of 5,043 seats. Among different cities in Maharashtra, Pune is on top in terms of applications under RTE Act with 60,505 registrations followed by Nagpur (30,049), Thane (19,419), Nashik (17,065) and Mumbai (12,149).

“No documents are required for online registration and it is one of the reasons behind the rise in applications. The beneficiaries will have to submit necessary documents during the scrutiny process. We expect the number of claimants to go down during verification of documents,” an official from education department of Aurangabad zilla parishad said.

“We demand stringent scrutiny of income proof certificate and leave-and-licence agreement submitted as address proof. We claim that many fake beneficiaries benefit from RTE Act by producing these documents. The authorities must carry out stringent checks,” educational activist Prashant Sathe said.

The theme of the fashion show was “a leap to the sky” which was the idea of two junior college students of KTHM College — Rin Yamabe and Garima Nikam.

Yamabe is a host student from Japan under the inter-cultural exchange programme of American Field Service (AFS) who is studying in first year junior college while Nikam is her classmate who hails from Vadodara and stays in KTHM’s hostel for female students.

“When I first met these slum kids through an AFS community service and told them that I am from Japan, they asked me if Japan is ahead of Jail Road (an area in the city). It made me wonder that these kids have no clue about the world which they deserve to know,” Yamabe said.

When she narrated the story over social media, her friends from Japan, Italy, Malaysia, Peru and France offered fashionable clothes of their culture for the kids which gave them the idea of the fashion show.

“These kids are stars and the show is about them. We wanted them to believe that the sky above the whole world belongs to them too,” said Nikam.

Nagpur: The play ‘Karishma’, centred around the relationship between a married couple, was part of the 59th Maharashtra Rajya Hindi Natya Spardha 2019-20 organized by the state’s directorate of cultural affairs, Kala Sagar, at Scientific Hall, Laxmi Nagar, recently.

Thakur (Narendra Parihar) and his wife Vandana (Jyoti Rahate) live generously. They always help people whenever possible.

They raise their children Vinay (Suraj Kohade) and Nina (Vijaya Shinde) with love and affection. Vinay chooses the noble profession of a doctor while Nina decides to become a dance instructor.

The story takes a dramatic turn when Vinay falls in love with Shabnam (Rabneet Kaur). After finishing her daily chores, she helps Vinay in his clinic. Her sympathetic nature makes Vinay fall in love with her.

Meanwhile, Thakur is concerned about Nina and wants her to settle down. Pundit (Padam Nair) arranges a meeting with prospective groom Akhlesh (Harshal Sukhdeve), but Nina refuses to marry him because his nature does not impress her at all.

The story takes another turn when Atmaram (Suresh Sangolkar) visits Thakur. He becomes very sad while talking about his son whom he lost at a very young age. The only thing that Thakur could offer Atmaram was sympathy.

As Atmaram is about to depart, Nina notices a mark on his hand which resembles the mark on Shankar’s (Lokesh Chorpe) hand. Shankar was introduced as an orphan who resides in Thakur’s house since childhood and later, works as a manager in his office. But with the series of events that follow, Nina finds out that he is Atmaram’s lost son.

Nina starts to develop feelings for Shankar and turns down many marriage proposals.

When she expresses her desire to marry Shankar, her parents happily agree.

Vinay, on the other hand, has a tough time convincing his parents about the love of his life. Eventually, he succeeds.

The message that love is the biggest relationship was conveyed to the audience precisely through the play written and directed by Nair.

169,['2/03/2020'],"It is important to under-promise, over-deliver: Cognizant CEO","Chennai: Brian Humphries was appointed as CEO of Cognizant last April. He took over at a time when the company lost its bellwether status. In conversation with ToI, he details his plans and vision to get back to industry leadership. Excerpts:

How is your “Fit for Growth” plan shaping up?

Things are always refined, but at the end of the day, “Fit for growth” as an initiative is to make sure Cognizant thinks about not just where we are today but also where we want to be in 3, 5, 8, 12 years. We are approximately $17 billion today and I don’t think about Cognizant being just a $20 billion business; but a $30 billion dollar business. So, how do you make sure you allow ourselves to scale to that level?

This is the equivalent of somebody wanting to run a marathon. You don’t run it unless you do some training.

We’ve been very clear: there’s an absolute focus on clients, and associates to make sure that we engage them and motivate them. I am very pleased to say that our voluntary attrition is now at a 2-year low at its mid-teens.

Our employee motivation is picking up. But most of all, the optimism is back that we have a bright future, and are aiming to outgrow the industry and I think people’s morale has picked up.

Is it possible for you to quantify ‘optimism is back’?

When I see our associates, we do one-on-ones and town halls. After every one of those town halls, we get surveys, NPS (net promoter scores). And so, throughout the world, over the last 11 months, I have been tracking the NPS.

Simultaneously, we look at our attrition rates as a company. In Q4, our attrition rate fell 3 percentage points from Q3. Q3 was 24, Q4 was 21. But more importantly, we are trying to drive a performance culture in Cognizant.

You guided to 2%-4% growth in the last quarter, isn’t that a disappointment?

Well, I think you should always differentiate between guidance versus actuals. Hopefully, you have seen that in the last 3 quarters since I’ve arrived, we have beaten our guidance and consensus. So, I am a big believer in setting expectations that we can over-deliver against.

Are you under-promising?

With Wall Street, it is important to under-promise , over-deliver. Our ambition in the years ahead is to once again become the industry bellwether, which requires us to grow faster than 2%-4%.

Traditional expertise in financial services and healthcare appear to be strained?

Well, to be honest, they will both improve in the first half of this year. So we expect those to start contributing to growth again in the coming quarters.

Making sure that the CEO sends a strong growth message. That we hire more freshers, get the right skills and set money aside to invest in growth.

You are probably aware that at this moment of time, we have committed over 500 incremental revenue-generating resources. It also requires stronger partnerships. I have spoken at length about the importance of our relationship with companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Salesforce and Workday and ServiceNow and companies like SAP and Adobe. On strategy, international is just 24% of Cognizant, it needs to be substantially higher. We’ve selected four specific battlegrounds in digital that we want to win in; namely cloud, data analytics, digital engineering and IoT. I am confident that with strategy and client-centric mentality of growth that starts with me, if I am seeing about 20 clients a week, with the increased focus we put on employee engagement, it puts us in a great position to win.

Strategy is about not doing certain things too?

Perhaps, one of the most topical things we made a decision on, is to exit the over quarter of a billion-dollar business in one subset of content moderation services.

It was not an area where we had intellectual property, it was a high growth area, but not an area that was strategic to us. And so that’s an area where at this moment in time, we have decided to work with our platform partners to actually exit that business.

We will have an impact on about 6,000 employees.

Is wage inflation rising?

It’s not something we are overly concerned about.

Every country is becoming very protectionist about its own business?

It’s interesting, I was there in Davos in January, and some of it was around globalisation versus nationalism, and multiple stakeholder management, shareholders vs other constituents - including the environment, etc., so I think as a society we are increasingly conflicted and challenged intellectually when we think about this.

I believe in a global world, I believe in free trade and I also believe that we have multiple stakeholders to manage. As an example, I signed with the business roundtable in the US last year a letter signed by I think over 100 CEO’s advocating that the role of the CEO is beyond simply shareholder value creation.

Future sunrise sectors! What are all the sectors you are seeding now?

I think first of all you have to realise that international is still a huge opportunity, it’s just 24% of Cognizant unlike perhaps, 50% for one of our leading competitors, so I view that as a huge-huge opportunity that we can seed.

We want to expand geographically, diversify across our client base and then, of course, there are next-generation growth areas - things like IoT, software product engineering, even cloud.

I am increasingly aware of IoT. I think it becomes a tremendous set of nascent capabilities for Cognizant, around things like industry 4.0 or autonomous driving or anything where latency and security become very important.

Do you get angry when a client walks away?

I never get angry that the client walks away because invariably it’s our fault, not the client’s.

I had mentioned in our most recent earnings call that our win rate, in terms of every opportunity we are going after, our win rate has materially increased by 5 percentage points in the last 12 months.

171,['2/03/2020'],‘88% beneficiaries used biometrics at fair price shops in January’,"Almost 88% of the beneficiaries of the public distribution system (PDS) in the district use biometrics to get supplies from the fair price shops (FPS), said DSO Arvind Narsikar during a conversation with TOI’s Abhilash Botekar. The officer added that the Shiv Bhojan centres in the Nashik district have already served 27,122 meals since the scheme’s launch

Q) What efforts are being made to ensure timely delivery of goods?

At this point, most of the delivery to 2,608 fair price shops from the Food Corporation of India godowns is done by the date. In most cases, the delivery is done by the 10th of each month. The same facility may be extended to all other areas after sorting out the transportation issues.

Q) What measures are being taken to increase storage capacity?

A) As per the directions of the state government and the Nashik collector, the work on the construction of 13 godowns is nearing completion.

Q) Has biometric usage by beneficiaries been made compulsory?

A) Yes, biometric usage has been made mandatory for all beneficiaries to get their quota of grains through the FPA. More than one member is allowed to buy the quota from the FPAs by using the system. But since there are still some connectivity issues in the remote areas, people there are allowed to pick up the goods without biometric confirmation. Utmost care is taken to ensure the beneficiaries get what they pay for and as per their quota. It may be noted, that foodgrain for 6.69 lakh ration cards were issued using biometrics in January. This amounts to 88% of the total cards.

Dehradun: The budget session due to start on March 3 in the hill town of Gairsain is set to be a stormy one. Thousands of government employees, who have been agitating on the issue of reservation in promotion, are set for a direct confrontation with the government by boycotting the session and taking out a march to the assembly on the day the session starts.

The General and OBC employees’ association has announced an indefinite work boycott from Monday with its office-bearers saying they will be marching to Gairsain on Tuesday.

Besides, the government has also been facing criticism from opposition Congress which has been vocal about the session being only for five days which they say is inadequate time for deliberations to be conducted.

Making the situation even more worrisome for the government is the fact that the ‘Gairsain-for capital’ agitators have again raised the demand to announce Gairsain as the summer capital of Uttarakhand.

Deepak Joshi, the chairman of secretariat employees’ union and federation of General and OBC employees, told TOI, “We have met the CM over the issue but the talks failed to bring about any results. Therefore, we are adamant on our stand. The motive is not to disrupt work but ensure that the state government follows the Supreme Court (SC) order.”

To recall, through an order on September 11 last year, the government had stopped promotion in government jobs as the matter was sub-judice. The SC on February 7 this year held that the state government is not bound to provide reservation in appointments, and there is no fundamental right to claim quota in promotions. The employees after the SC order are now asking the state government to revoke its September 2019 order and start the departmental promotion committee meeting at the earliest.

Meanwhile, Congress wants the assembly session to be extended saying that it seemed like “a mere symbolic session.” Congress state chief Pritam Singh said, “The five-day budget session is a mere formality as it is too short to hold a budget session. There will not be adequate time to discuss issues. If the governor’s speech and debate on it is held on day one, it will leave us with just four days.”

Meanwhile, urban development minister and government spokesperson Madan Kaushik said that the government was serious on the issue of employees. “The CM and I have both spoken to the employees and are looking into the matter,” he added. On the issue of extending the budget session, he said that if the Opposition was willing, the session on each day can be conducted till the late night hours.

175,['2/03/2020'],5 men arrested for trying to grab land in Vellalore,"Coimbatore: A five-member gang was arrested on Sunday for attempting to grab nine cents vacant land at Vellalore from a 55-year-old realtor.

According to police, C V Thomas, of NRR Layout at Singanallur, had bought the land when it was auctioned by a bank in 2007 after its owner failed to repay loan.

“The land was earlier owned by S Gangadharan, an AIADMK functionary from Vellalore, who had pledged it and taken the loan. It was auctioned as he didn’t repay the loan,” a police officer said.

On Saturday evening, when Thomas went to put up a fence around his land, Sathya Pasupathi, 43, of Thoothukudi district, his car driver R Jothish, 29, of Munnar and friends K Dhamodaran, 27, of Sivakashi, Gangadharan and P Petchimuthu, 43, of Vellalore, assaulted him.

They also erected the flags of Pasupathiyar Tamizhaga Munnetra Kazhagam, a political outfit launched by Pasupathi, on the land.

Thomas alerted the Podanur police and a team lead by assistant commissioner of police Cedric Manuel and inspector P Maheswaran reached the spot and asked the five-member gang to vacate the area. However, Pasupathi argued with police and told them that he had taken the land on lease for 99 years from Gangadharan.

Police, however, booked the five under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapons), 294 (b) (sings, recites, or utters any obscene song, ballad or words in or near any public place), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 447 (punishment for criminal trespass), 448 (punishment for house-trespass), 506 (ii) (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu Open Places (Prevention of Disfigurement) Act and arrested them. All the five were lodged in the Coimbatore Central Prison under Judicial custody on Sunday.

Pasupathi, the officer said, has three murder cases and as many attempt-to-murder cases pending against him. He was a close aide of Pasupathi Pandian, founder of Federation of Devendrakula Vellalars, who was murdered by a gang at his residence in Dindigul district in January 2012.

“After the demise of Pandian, Pasupathi started his own party called Pasupathiyar Tamizhaga Munnetra Kazhagam,” the officer said.

176,['2/03/2020'],23 drinking water packaging companies sealed in district,"Coimbatore: Following the directions of the Madras high court , public works department (PWD) officials along with tahsildars have sealed 23 drinking water packaging units that were functioning without the required license in the district as on Sunday.

As many as 52 such units are functioning in the district, collector K Rajamani said. “The remaining companies will be sealed on Monday. Five of them have applied for the license.”

A few days ago, HC had directed the State government to close the illegal drinking water packing units in the state before Monday and file a compliance report on Tuesday.

Following the judgement, packaged drinking water manufacturers across the state called an indefinite strike, which entered fourth day on Sunday. The manufacturers also assembled for an urgent meeting at Eachanari on the city outskirts.

“The government order that mandates obtaining groundwater clearance from the PWD was passed only in 2014. But close to 920 companies, including 35 in the district, have been functioning for long,” D Suresh Kumar of the Package Drinking Water Association said. “We have other certificates, including those from the Small Scale Industry (SSI) and Indian Standard Institute (ISI). We were facing a lot of practical difficulties in obtaining the license. The order mandates that no two borewells should be operated within a distance of 75 metres. When we had started the companies, there weren’t any borewells within the specified distance. But as years passed, several buildings and borewells were set up on the surrounding areas,” he told TOI.

“Also, before submitting the application to PWD, we need to obtain permission from the revenue inspector or tahsildar saying that there is no waterbody within five kilometres radius. The officials would sign only after inspecting the location. It is a very time-consuming process,” he said.

The units in the district are consuming only a few percentage of the underground water, Suresh said. “If the sealing drive continues, fake companies will enter the market. “We request the government to exempt those companies set up before 2014 from the government order and provide us the license,” he added.

178,['2/03/2020'],Left outfits using CAA to spread anarchy: State BJP prez,"Nashik: State BJP president Chandrakant Patil on Sunday said that left outfits are using issues like Citizens Amendment Act and Muslim reservation to spread anarchy across the country.

Speaking to reporters during his one-day visit to Nashik , Patil said even the NCP president Sharad Pawar and Congress were unaware of the agenda of the left outfits and urban naxals to destabilise the country.

“The CAA has got nothing to do with the Muslims of the country and yet they are being instigated to oppose the same. The Muslims are unable to gauge that the urban naxals and leftists are the ones who are calling shots by putting them in the front,” he said.

The senior BJP leader said the leftist forces were using several agendas to grab support of the people from all quarters only to destabilise the country.

“During the last 10 years Muslims did not face any issue and there were no riots. What has happened all of a sudden? Their agenda of destabilising the country is gaining momentum through agitations without substance,” Patil said.

“Sharad Pawar is also unable to gauge their game plan. The Congress is unable to understand it either. Muslims are also unaware of it. Opposition to CAA for political purpose is not done. Also opposing the census, a regular feature, is only strengthening the game-plan of the leftists,” he added.

Being asked about the political development in BJP’s Nashik unit, Patil said there was no discord among the members.

The outgoing chairperson of the standing committee, Uddhav Nimse, after the last day in office claimed that BJP corporators, leaders and office-bearers harassed him during his one-year tenure as the chairperson.

“All BJP members and office-bearers were working together. There are some misunderstandings that are taken care of by the party at the end of the day,” Patil said.

179,['2/03/2020'],Properties with pending dues of Rs 1.92cr attached,"Nashik: The City Survey Office of Land Records has attached 8,665 properties from property holders in the city for pending dues worth Rs 1.92 crore. With this attachment, the property holders will not be able to sell it before this attachment is cleared.

The property card holders have to pay the one-time fees for their properties. As and when they clear their dues, the property will be released.

The land record department has carried out a survey of the city and prepared property cards of all non-agricultural properties in the city. Each property has been assigned a unique identity.

“We have prepared property cards of each property in the city. We have also conducted camps and drives appealing to people to take their cards. Yet, there are many who have still not taken their cards,” Superintendent of Land Record Mahesh Shinde said.

City Survey Officer Changdeo Mohalkar said that the response of citizens towards taking property cards was not very enthusiastic and this was largely because of lack of awareness among the masses.

“In future, transactions in the non-agricultural areas will be carried out on the basis of property cards only. These cards have detailed and accurate measurements. Since, we are in a transition phase at this point of time, and awareness related to property cards is less, people were not very forthcoming to take their cards. We have, therefore, attached their properties,” Mohalkar said.

“The property will be released as soon as the payment is done. But, the process of clearing the dues and getting the attachment released could take over a month’s time. It is better that the citizens go to the city survey offices beforehand and connect with the officers to get the exact idea of the status of their property card,” Mohalkar added.

A total of 45,544 property cards have been prepared by the department even as the work on the cards in others areas is being carried out. A total of 38,729 property holders have cleared their dues while 8,665 property holders are yet to do so.

Manipal: About 41 innovations were exhibited as part of the fourth Manipal Entrepreneurship Summit (MES). The fourth edition of MES of Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE) was jointly hosted by Manipal Institute of Technology (MIT), Innovation Center, Manipal Universal Technology Business Incubator (MUTBI) and Manipal-Govt of Karnataka Bioincubator. The two-day event ended on Saturday.

Among other exhibits, on display was Onco-dent, a novel device with multiple functions which helps patients with oral cancer. The project has been developed by Dr Garima Makhija, Dr Shreya Lakshmi and Dr Namrata Datta, interns of Manipal College of Dental Sciences, and supported by Dr Swathi Pai, faculty member. Dr Shreya Lakshmi told STOI that the toothbrush comes with two brush heads. It provides local drug delivery and stimulation of salivary flow, which is ideal during post and pre-operation. “The prototype is ready, and we have applied for a patent,” she said, adding that the toothbrush is cost-efficient.

Suyog Wagh and Prateek Kapoor, fourth-year mechanical engineering students of Manipal Institute of Technology, have developed Rev-X, a refurbished electric scooter. Suyog said: “Generally,any old vehicle which is unfit for use is considered a scrap. Towards effective waste management, we are working on refurbishing old scooters. Our first prototype of converting an old scooter into an electric one has been successful. For two hours of battery charging, the scooter can run up to 60km. The cost is around Rs 45,000. We have applied for a patent, and we will be experimenting with motorbikes soon,” Suyog added.

Recording vaccinations

The Innovation Center at MAHE, the Community Medicine Department of KMC Manipal and the Manipal Institute of Technology have developed a novel digital and visual platform to record vaccinations for children. This includes a mobile app, wherein healthcare workers enter vaccination data. The data is backed up on a secure cloud server and also stored on a smartcard, and mothers are given HealthGate Passport documenting vaccination due dates. It was formally launched on Friday. The package costing less than Rs 200 per child can record the child’s entire vaccination history, said Dr Arun Shanbhag, chief innovation officer, MAHE and principal investigator of the project funded by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and Grand Challenges Explorer Awards.

“Currently, over 700 patients are part of this network, and there are plans to cover the entire district. Auxiliary nurse midwives have been provided with smartphones with a sim card, and Wi-Fi dongles have been given to public health centres as part of the project,” he said. The team is working on providing SMS alerts to the card holders a week in advance about the vaccination.

HYDERABAD: Hyderabad police locked all the gates of English and Foreign Languages University ( EFLU ) and stopped students and professors from stepping outside the campus on Sunday.

Students alleged that police locked all gates to stop them from taking part in a protest being organized in solidarity with Delhi riots victims and against Citizen Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), near Karachi bakery at Moazzam Jahi Market.

“At around 3pm, police locked all the gates of varsity and restricted anyone from venturing outside the campus. The gates were opened only after two hours,” said Harshal Deshpande, vice-president, student union of EFLU adding that the lockdown of campus was unacceptable. “If they can lock the campus today just because they got information that we would be taking part in a protest, they could hold us as hostages in our own campus in the future.”

The students said that the police informed them that they received intelligence about members of the right-wing student group planning to attack EFLU students if they took part in the protest. They said that police should have taken those planning the attack into custody instead of locking down the entire campus.

“It was not like the protest call was given by the student union of EFLU. We got information about the event and a group of students were discussing about taking part in the protest,” said Samar Ali, general secretary of the student union. She said some students were about to step out of the campus to reach Karachi Bakery when the police locked the gates. “The plan was that a group of students will go for the protest and update the students at the campus so those interested could join the talk,” she added.

Meanwhile, M Ramesh, DCP, East zone said that they locked the campus gates as no permission was given for the said march or protest at Karachi bakery. The varsity administration confirmed that police informed the proctor before locking the gates saying that there is something happening at Moazzam Jahi Market and students stepping out can further aggravate it.

They, however, added that they immediately got the locks removed as there was nothing happening at the campus. At Osmania University campus also, students were allegedly stopped from heading to Karachi bakery.

184,['2/03/2020'],Fall in number of small saving scheme agents,"Coimbatore: The number of agents working under the small saving scheme to promote the idea of savings among the public, has seen a sharp decline after the state government had withdrew their annual incentive about a decade ago.

Recovering gradually from the blow, the district administration has been working on to increase the number of agents working for the scheme in the district. At present, 1,400 agents are working under the scheme.

An official from the district administration said 1,010 women work as agents under Mahila Pradhan Kshetriya Bachat Yojana (MPKBY) to promote recurring deposits among the public and 390 persons work as agents under Standard Agency System (SAS) to promote fixed deposits in the district. Every year, crores of rupees is being deposited in the district.

Explaining that the agents will have to convenience the public to deposit at least a small amount under the small saving scheme in postal departments, the official said that SAS agents would get 0.5% and MPKBY agents would get 4% as commission for each deposit.

“But until 2011, the state government had been giving 0.5% of the total deposits made in a year as incentive to SAS agents and 2% of the total deposits made in a year as incentive to MPKBY agents. While the neighbouring states including Kerala continue to give the incentive amount to the agents, our state government has stopped it abruptly. As a result, some of the agents had started to opt out of the field,” the source explained. The number of agents in the district in 2011 was as high as 2,000.

After the number started to drop steadily, it is only in the last few years the officials had taken initiatives to increase it. As of part of which, they have been educating both the anganwadi workers and block level officials about the benefits of small saving schemes and who in turn would help both to find suitable agents and make public deposit a sum in the post offices, the official added.

As a result, as many as 27 new agents had started to work under the scheme, this year, the official said, adding that anyone who clears the police verification could become an agent. To encourage the agents, the central government has allotted a sum of Rs 36,000 to identify and honour the best performing agents. For this year, the best performing agents would be honoured by collector K Rajamani on Monday.

186,['2/03/2020'],Seeking fresh declaration while porting medical insurance is illegal: Forum,"Nashik: The Nashik district consumer disputes redressal forum has said it is illegal for insurance companies to seek a fresh declaration of pre-illness from a consumer who has ported a policy from another insurer.

The decision comes in the wake of a move by Apollo Munich Health Insurance, which denied the claim of a consumer by saying he had failed to mention a family member’s disease while porting from ICICI Lombard.

The forum asked Apollo Munich to settle a claim of Rs 1.04 lakh along with 10% interest from March 31, 2017. The company was also asked to pay out Rs 5,000 for harassment and Rs 3,000 towards costs incurred.

Complainant Nitin Bhat, a resident of Indira Nagar, had taken out a family protection insurance policy from ICICI Lombard in 2011. In 2015, he ported to Apollo Munich Health Insurance.

In 2011, Bhat’s son had to be taken into care for problems with his left eye. Doctors were able to treat the patient. But the problem resurfaced in 2014, this time in the boy’s right eye. A year later, in 2015, the boy had to be taken to specialists when the problem occurred again. He was referred to the LV Prasad Eye Institute in Hyderabad, where doctors performed a surgery on December 7, 2016. The cost of the procedure was Rs 1.04 lakh.

Bhat submitted the claim to the company, which proceeded to reject it by saying the boy’s care was part of a “pre-disease”. The company also refused to renew the insurance.

Bhat then registered a complaint with the consumer forum on May 28, 2018. He said the claim should be settled along with a payout of Rs 30,000, for mental stress.

In a written reply to the forum, Apollo Munich, through its counsel P P Pawar, claimed that the son of the consumer was suffering from ‘pitosis’ and that this fact was not disclosed in the pre-disclosure form at the time of porting-in. The company argued that it had not erred while rejecting the claim.

But a three-member forum, headed by president Milind Sonawane, in its judgment observed that the diseases and period being considered by the first health insurance company is binding on the company that the consumer picked while porting. “If this is portability, where does the question of new declaration come in? Therefore, the new declaration is not with the law,” the forum ruled.

The forum also clarified that if the pre-disclosure has to be considered, it would be with the declaration given to the first company, which has not been presented here. It also underlined the fact that insurance companies cannot rely on the “discharge summary” as it cannot be considered as conclusive evidence as ruled by the senior courts.

Senior officials of the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) Nashik , said that post June 1, they would start collecting samples of sweets sold in loose. They even warned of taking strict action against owners of sweet shops who display wrong information of the date of manufacture.

Joint director of FDA (food), Nashik, Chandrashekhar Salunke said, “Cases will be registered against the FBOs if they fail to adhere to the norms set by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). There is a provision under Section 58 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, to lodge cases against FBOs. The FBOs will also face legal action if they provide wrong information regarding the date of manufacture and best before date.”

FDA officials said that there have been instances in the past where stale or expired sweets have been sold to consumers, posing a risk to their health.

While it is mandatory for pre-packed sweets to mention the date of manufacture and best before date on their labels as per the Food Safety and Standards (Packaging and Labelling) Regulations, 2011, the regulatory compliance division of the FSSAI has decided to make it mandatory for non-packaged or loose sweets also to provide the same details.

FDA officials from Nashik said that FBOs shall decide and display the necessary dates of sweets depending upon the nature of the product and local conditions. An indicative list of shelf life of various types of sweets is mentioned in the guidance note of ‘Safety and Quality of traditional milk products’—available on the FSSAI website.

Food safety officers across the district and Nashik division will ensure that the food business operators are complying with the directions.

192,['2/03/2020'],"U’khand spent Rs 6cr in past 4 yrs, sterilised 15k monkeys","Dehradun: The Uttarakhand forest department has spent around Rs 6.02 crore in the past four years in containing the simian menace in the state, data exclusively accessed by TOI has revealed. The state currently has three rescue centres — at Chidiyapur in Haridwar; Ranibagh in Nainital and at Almora. As per the data, 10, 620 monkeys were sterilised at Chidiyapur in the period 2016-17 to 2019-20 while 4,602 monkeys were sterilised at Ranibagh between 2017-18 to 2019-20 whereas 269 monkeys were sterilised at Almora between 2017-18 to 2019-20 (the Ranibagh and Almora centres had not started in 2016-17). In all, 15,591 monkeys were sterilised in the period between 2016-17 and 2019-20, the data reveals. However, a total of 60,002 monkeys were caught during this period, as per the data.

So, why were all monkeys that were caught not sterilised? Forest officials cite a number of reasons — ranging from paucity of trained staff to factors like the ‘right season’ not being there to sterilise female monkeys. “Scarcity of veterinary doctors is a perennial issue being faced by the forest department and often, doctors from animal husbandry department are brought on contract basis which is why, sterilisation numbers are limited,” said a forest official.

Dr Amit Dhyani, veterinary doctor at Chidiyapur Rescue Centre, added, “Monkeys caught between January to June are often pregnant and therefore, it is not possible to sterilise them since it is prohibited by law.”

Forest officials allege that catching monkeys is also a time-consuming and costly exercise. “We call monkey-catchers from Mathura, each of whom charges around Rs 500 per day. It is not easy to trap monkeys. Sometimes, the monkey-catcher does not get a single monkey despite several hours of trying. Once they sense that they are being trapped, monkeys immediately convey it to other monkeys who become extra cautious. Therefore, it is very difficult to justify the money spent in this activity,” claimed a senior IFS officer.

As part of this plan, the city police have appointed 85 officers. Each of these officers has adopted one traffic junction.

The police officer’s work is to observe the problems at his adopted junction and then work towards addressing those problems.

“The officers have already started their work. Problems at all the 85 important junctions, which have been shortlisted, would be addressed within a month,” said police commissioner Vishwas Nangare-Patil.

“Junctions in the city are facing a range of problems, which all lead to traffic chaos. At some places, the signals are not positioned well, elsewhere, illegal hawkers have occupied space or shopkeepers have made ramps on footpaths for personal use. Many junctions also have illegal parking problems. Posters and banners also only hinder the visibility,” added the top cop. “The police officers are working on all such small, but important, issues,” he said.

Decongestion of vehicular traffic at Dwarka, Shalimar and other such junctions is the result of the continuous work by the police officers concerned.

Police officers said they are also in touch with senior officers of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) to put in place, or put right, all the necessary infrastructure for a free flow of traffic.

On the insistence of the city police, 65 students of NDMVP Samaj’s College of Architecture studied the traffic situation at the 85 major junctions in three slots of the day and noted down information based on various parameters, including the flow of traffic, condition of road dividers, locations of signals, signboards, rickshaw and bus stands, number of trees and every other things that was hampering the vehicular movement. The city police are working on the suggestions made by the students. At the same time, the police commissioner has instructed all the four unit heads of the city traffic branch to visit at least one junction every day.

Police officers check for various problems that may be obstructing traffic flow — vehicles stopping beyond the zebra lines, wrong-side driving, encroachments, traffic signal timings, signboards, condition of meridians, parking issues, etc.

After visiting one junction every day and observing the traffic there, the officer concerned reports in writing and also sends WhatsApp messages to his seniors about the immediate measures that can be taken to ease congestion, long-term plan, use of manpower and the communication to the department concerned to improve conditions.

Police officials said that everything is going as it has been planned. In a matter of the next couple of months, there would hardly be a junction which would have any traffic congestion related problem.

The state government, Padma said, is giving top priority to women’s welfare. “Every woman should utilise the rights provided by the Constitution and emerge as a power,” the chairperson said.

Padma added that, “Unconditional humanity is needed for the welfare of women. Chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy is committed to the safety of women. The Disha Act is a landmark legislation and many states are trying to implement similar Acts.”

Padma said that the commission is gearing up to conduct International Women’s Day on a large scale in order to educate women on their rights. “Gender-based discrimination is a crime. But still women face it in many forms. Women can perform better if they are given a chance and we should think in this direction,” she said.

Special officer for the Disha Act Kritika Shukla said that women have the right to question odds against them. She added that the Disha Act will instil confidence in women.

Krishna district collector A Mohammed Imtiaz said that women comprise 50 per cent of the population and can advance in their fields with encouragement.

The rally extended till Tummalapalli Kalakshetram in the city. The commission will also conduct power walks in Rajahmundry, Kurnool and Vishakapatnam.

In Tirupati, faculty members and female students of Sri Padmavathi Mahila Viswa Vidyalayam (SPMVV) held a power walk on Sunday.

The walk was named ‘Our space — our right’ to indicate that women have the right to walk in any place at any time and without fear. Vice-chancellor D Jamuna launched the walk by flagging it off from the campus. She called upon men and women to join hands in wiping out gender inequality, pointing out that dominance by males cannot be an impediment to women’s empowerment. Prof Jamuna also recalled the varsity’s motto of ensuring equal opportunities to women through education and empowerment.

The incident took place in the Janta Raja Colony of the Panchavati area at around 8 pm.

According to police, the 54-year-old complainant, a resident of Janta Raja Colony, had been to a weekly market in Hanuman Wadi on Friday evening when an unidentified biker approached her, snatched her chain and fled from the spot.

The bird was trapped in a fishing net and was struggling to free itself from it. We gave the bird some water to drink as it was exhausted from trying to escape from the net,” said M Srinivas, a photographer and member of Hyderabad Birding Pals.The spoonbills are still struggling with the plastic ropes tangled around their beaks. “We identified the different spoonbills by the colour of plastic ropes around their beaks,” said Pradeep Nair, founder of Animal Warriors India (AWI).

The door-to-door pension distribution process was overseen by the urban community development (UCD) wing of the civic body.

Genuine beneficiaries had been identified under the Navasakam survey and doorstep disbursal of pension was started in February this year.

Pensioners expressed satisfaction at the door-to-door pension distribution process. “Receiving pension was a big task for us earlier. Being physically-challenged, I used to stand for more than five hours in a long queue to get pension. But things changed recently. Volunteers are coming to our doorstep and distributing cash after taking our biometric details. We are happy with this process,” said M Nagamani, a pensioner residing at Ajith Singh Nagar.

VMC commissioner V Prasanna Venkatesh inspected the door-to-door pension distribution process in a few wards in the city and interacted with pensioners. Venkatesh also directed volunteers to complete the distribution process by Monday evening.

Several pensioners who were excluded after the Navasakam survey was held to identify beneficiaries have requested the civic body to speed up its verification process and re-issue pensions.

The state government had launched the village and ward volunteer system to deliver services to the doorstep of beneficiaries.

204,['2/03/2020'],Corpn officials cause delay in clearing UGD blocks,"Trichy: Corporation officials are holding the city hostage to overflowing sewage and stinky roads as they are causing delays to clear underground drainage (UGD) blocks citing paperwork delay. Despite having digital tools, junior officials have been told to submit a written paper request to senior officials for clearing UGD blocks, and as a result road are overflowing with sewage for days.

Usually, junior engineers on receiving a complaint of sewage block will mobilise a sewer jetting machine to clear the block. After the civic body suspended a couple of engineers last month over complaints of manual scavenging, the corporation orally instructed junior engineers to alert the respective zone assistant commissioner in writing before clearing the blocks.

The senior officials will subsequently forward the request to sanitary officers and inspectors who will accompany them to the spot. Sanitary workers were told to use safety gears and not to venture inside the manholes. Though the restrictions to prevent manual scavenging were welcomed, involving paperwork to clear the blocks has made the city roads stink.

For the last two days, sewage has been overflowing on Williams road and Reynolds road without any solution. “Submitting a written request is a time-consuming process. Sanitary officers could have been told to supervise the block removal process to put a check on manual scavenging,” an official source said. Engineers say that if assistant commissioners are not available immediately, it may delay the work further as per the order. “Till we clear the sewer block in the presence of senior officials, sewage overflow will persist,” the official added.

However, corporation commissioner S Sivasubramanian said that the existing machinery with the corporation is adequate to clear the sewer blocks while assistant commissioners are always available to oversee cleaning works.

“The order to clean sewer block in the presence of assistant commissioners was only to ensure the safety of workers involved. UGD block is due to public error, people should realise the risk associated in cleaning the blocks and use UGD responsibly by not dumping napkins in the toilets,” Sivasubramanian told TOI.

206,['2/03/2020'],CRPF told to reinstate personnel who was removed from service,"Madurai: Granting relief to a CRPF personnel who was removed from service for failing to open fire during a militant attack in Manipur in 2002 where seven CRPF personnel were killed, Madras high court observed that since the petitioner was alive on the spot, it cannot be stated that he did not retaliate during the attack.

The petitioner, S Sarin Singh, joined CRPF as a constable at the Avadi training centre in Chennai in 1994. In 2002, he was posted to Manipur where the Army and other security forces were fighting insurgency. On November 20, 2002, when the petitioner was assigned the duty for providing protection to National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) officers in a road opening party, there was an attack by the militants. When the petitioner was taking position to retaliate, he fell into a 12-foot ditch and became unconscious. Following the incident, he was suspended from service and a charge memo was issued to him on the ground that he had not opened fire.

Subsequently, after an inquiry, the petitioner was removed from service in 2003. Though the petitioner preferred an appeal and review before the authorities, the same were rejected. Hence, the petitioner moved the Madurai bench of the Madras high court in 2014, seeking to quash these orders and reinstate him back into service with all consequential attendant service and monetary benefits. It was the grievance of the petitioner that the inquiry was conducted in a preconceived manner only to indicate that he had not opened fire at the militants and was negligent in his duty.

The counsel appearing for the authorities stated that one platoon consisting of three sections was on duty on the road opening party. He stated that the first section was ambushed and attacked by the underground militants. The petitioner, who was leading the second section, was very close to the incident spot and did not fire a single round to prevent the insurgents from taking away the arms and ammunitions of the deceased personnel. Instead, he had hidden in a safe place. Due to his inaction and cowardice, the force had to lose precious lives of seven personnel and huge quantity of arms and ammunitions.

He noted that during the inquiry, it was established that despite the orders of the Section Commander concerned to open fire on the militants and his statement that he had fallen into a ditch and became unconscious and sustained injury was found baseless. He further stated that as per the statements of witnesses in the inquiry, the petitioner was in good health condition and he reported his shoulder problem only on December 24, 2002 and sought permission to leave the headquarters for treatment only on January 3, 2003. Accordingly, he was granted 15 days’ leave. Justice J Nisha Banu rejected the contention of the authorities that the petitioner has shown inaction and exhibited cowardice without any evidence. The judge observed that the perusal of record shows that the petitioner was available on the spot and whether he had taken effort to retaliate cannot be decided by the authorities.

“It is also not in dispute that the petitioner became unconscious on the date of occurrence and he had taken treatment due to the injury in his left shoulder and there is no explanation by the authorities to show that the injury sustained by the petitioner was not on account of the alleged attack of the militants,” observed the judge.

Taking cognizance of the fact that the petitioner has put in eight years of service in the force, the judge observed that the findings of the inquiry are based on surmises without any evidence. Hence, the judge set aside the orders passed by the authorities and directed to reinstate the petitioner with all consequential service and monetary benefits, within 12 weeks.

207,['2/03/2020'],"In Guntur, Dalits and minorities come together to oppose CAA","WE, THE PEOPLE: A huge crowd registered its protest against CAA at the BR Stadium in Guntur on Sunday

Guntur: YSRC MLA Mohammed Mustafa said chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy has promised to move a resolution against Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) and National Register of Citizen ( NRC ) in the budget session of the assembly.

While addressing a public meeting organized by Jamiath-Ulema-e-Hind along with various SC, ST organisations at BR Stadium, Mustafa said he was ready to quit the assembly if the resolution was not passed in the assembly.

Mustafa said Muslims in AP need not worry about NRC and CAA as long as Jagan is the chief minister.

Former minister Dokka Manikyavaraprasad said Shaheen Baagh protest is courageous attempt to protect the Indian Constitution. He said women were fighting to uphold rights of minorities, dalits, tribals and weaker sections of the country. He said protests against CAA, NPR and NRC were aimed at uniting all sections of society to defeat divisive forces.

Dokka said CAA was not only discriminatory to the Muslims but the entire poor sections of the country. Dokka said it was high-time people from SC, ST and minority communities got united to fight the fascist policies of the Centre.

He said the Constitution should be the guiding lamp for the enactment of any laws in India. “We are demanding the Centre to follow the Constitution. CAA, NPR and NRC are targeting not only the minorities but the poor dalits, tribals and weaker sections of society,” said Dokka.

APCC working president Mastan Vali warned the BJP leadership of serious consequences if it wanted to go ahead with CAA.

Guntur East legislator Maddali Giridhar criticized BJP’s policies. He said people were living harmoniously till BJP came into power. He said the BJP leadership sowed seeds of fear in the country in the name of CAA, NPR and NRC. He said that the chief minister had made it clear that YSRC would not support NRC in the state and was willing to move a resolution in the assembly against the CAA and NPR.

YSRC leader and agriculture market committee chairman Yesurathnam said that dalits and weaker sections of society were with Muslims and they would not allow BJP to crush the Constitution.

TDP leader Naseer Ahmed, Jana Sena leader Zia-ur-Rehman, Mala Mahanadu leader Mallela Venkatrao and BC leader Y Koteswara Rao addressed the gathering.

208,['2/03/2020'],RTI: Municipalities run by in-charge officers for yrs,"Trichy: Pudukottai may soon be declared a special grade municipality going by the revenue and rate of development it has, but the selection grade municipality is still to have a full-time commissioner, being run only by in-charge officer for over seven years now.

This is not the only civic body run by in-charge officers, as the state has a total 50 others facing the similar fate. “A total of 50 of the 121 municipalities in the state remain headless managed only by in-charge officers for years together,” said V P Sankar, former ward councillor of Manapparai Municipality.

The revelation came from commissioner of municipal administration (CMA) in a reply to an RTI query. When urban local bodies are yet to go to polls, decision making is largely affected in these local bodies as it being run by in-charge officers, he said. Revenue of the local body is affected by the same, said former local body representatives.

“For instance, a few shops constructed by the municipality park road has been shut over the last six months in Manapparai. The in-charge commissioner has been delaying tender to allocate shops which could have earned revenue to the municipality all these months,” Sankar said.

In most municipalities, manager should ideally be made the in-charge commissioner. However, municipal engineers have been given the responsibility as it is easy for the local politicians to obtain tender allocations, says K Muhamed Hussain, CPI town secretary, Trichy.

“We can approach engineers for emergency issues related to roads, street lights and drinking water supply. Engineers are responsible for about half field work and in-charge commissioner is an additional burden to them which often delays decision making,” he said.

Saying that nepotism has been rampant in such municipalities, Ibrahim Babu, former councilor of the Pudukkottai municipality, said that there was rule that close relatives of councillors should not get tender allocations. “But that rule has been thrown to the air,” he said.

Acknowledging that there are the vacant posts of commissioners in municipalities across state, commissioner of municipal administration K Baskaran said that appointments would be made soon to the vacant posts.

There are certain routine steps that needs to be followed while making appointment. Many steps should to be followed in the selection of officers and no pending vigilance inquiry is one of the main requisite, he said. Necessary steps are being taken to fill the posts for smooth administration, he added.

“We found agriculture being the primary occupation of people living in the hillock where Tapioca is widely cultivated. However, it was unusual for us to find some people also cultivating paddy, said Praveen S, a first year student of MAM B School.

Secretary, Thaneer, K C Neelamagam said that students were made to throw about 150 seed balls around Mangalam waterfalls. “They also joined us in collecting plastic waste left behind by tourists. They were sensitized on not littering forests by explaining its ill effects,” said Neelamegam.

BENGALURU: Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), which has been struggling to put in place adequate night shelters for the city’s homeless, has identified a number of new locations to set them up.

As per directions by the Supreme Court — which mandate one shelter for every 1 lakh people — Bengaluru needs at least 120. However, at present, the city has only nine functional night shelters, while work orders for another eight have been issued.

On February 23, mayor M Goutham Kumar tweeted that the Palike has identified five spots, two near Upparpet police station and three near Kumbargundi.

He said these five additional shelters will be set up soon and will cater to about 400 people.

“We have 14 facilities where night shelters can easily be operated and the zones which have been identified are Bommanahalli, Dasarahalli and Yelahanka,” said SG Raveendra, special commissioner (welfare).

BBMP will soon prepare a detailed project report, he added. The shelters — which will be operational 24/7 — will have separate space for men, women as well as transgenders. One toilet will be constructed for 10 people.

“At the nine existing shelters, 350 people are being helped. They have a floating population of 250,” a BBMP official said. The facilities will be equipped with CCTVs and drinking water.

Night shelters will be monitored by the joint commissioner, health officer, chief engineer, local councillor and an NGO, Raveendra said, adding that a few NGOs have been working towards rescuing the homeless and their involvement would help the Palike.

“We want to ensure that all the NGOs are paid regularly without any financial glitch,” he said. While National Urban Livelihood Mission will release the required funds, BBMP will be the implementing agency.

217,['2/03/2020'],An enterprise with a vision: A school for the blind,"Hyderabad: Driven by his vision to launch a residential school that provides free education to visually-impaired children , Alampur Saibaba Goud approached many families requesting them to send their wards to his new institute. This was in 1992, and it was difficult to convince people.

“I had to go door-to-door to convince family members to send their visually-impaired children to our school,” says Goud, the founder-chairman of Devnaar Foundation for the Blind. “When I started the school, I faced a lot of resistance from the society. For the first six years, I struggled to provide free residential education to all the students.”

Goud pooled in a few lakh rupees, a huge amount then, from his private practice as an ophthalmologist to launch the school. The Devnaar School for the Blind in Begumpet, which began with only four students 28 years ago, now has 550 students. It was India’s first such school then.

Now, among other facilities, the school boasts of a science lab with 3D models explaining anatomy and a modern computer lab. Recently, Goud established an audio-visual studio at a cost of Rs20 lakh, where teachers record their classes that can be accessed by students any time.

“The schoolteachers ensure that we even learn how the light reflects and how an image is developed using 3D models,” said D Chintu, a Class X student. The school also has its own printing press that publishes books in Braille and a library that houses Braille books of Nancy Drew and Harry Potter among others by famous authors.

From chartered accountants to successful entrepreneurs, the school has a large alumni network which now helps him expand his operations. Entrepreneur Srikanth Bolla, founder and CEO of Bollant Industries (Hyderabad), which has an annual turnover of Rs82 crore, is one of the many alumni of this School.

In 2009, Goud was awarded with Padma Shri in medicine. The school has 80 faculty members, many of whom are children who study there. “Nineteen years ago, I was looking for a school for my son, who is visually-impaired and has intellectual disability,” said G Hogla, an English teacher at the school. “Devnaar not only provided free education to my son, but also employed me as a teacher.”

Goud now envisions to launch a degree college for visually-impaired students.

The fourth destination, that is unaffected till now, is Dubai.Last week, International Air Transport Association stated airlines’ losses due to coronavirus will run into $30 billion.Officials of Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL), the operator of KIA, pointed out that passengers have now become ‘cautious about non-essential travel’ and that the coronavirus situation will affect “international traffic, in general, and particularly on Asian markets”. “It is difficult to, however, quantify the impact at this point,” BIAL said.“The spread of Covid-19 virus has had an impact on the growth of international travel. A few Indian carriers have temporarily suspended flights to China, Hong Kong and the Asian region. The virus has made passengers travelling to other southeast Asian countries, many of which have reported cases, cautious about non-essential travel, leading to lighter demand for travel to popular tourist destinations. The situation is evolving and BIAL is monitoring this on a month-by-month basis,” said a BIAL spokesperson.Since January 20, 34,490 passengers have been screened at KIA. Of them, 369 came to Bengaluru from Covid-19-affected countries. Of them, 269 are under home isolation and surveillance.All 198 samples tested for the infection from Karnataka have been found to be negative. Ninty-six passengers have, meanwhile, completed 28 days of observation.While airport authorities have predicted that KIA will record a growth of about 8.9% in international air traffic movements in FY 2019-20, based on the new routes announced and market conditions, it expects about 6-7% growth in international ATMs through FY 2020-21.As of February 25, China continues to be the worst affected with more than 78,497 confirmed COVID-19 cases, followed by South Korea (1,767).

222,['2/03/2020'],TRAI plans for optical fibre infra in housing complexes through building code,"TRAI chief R S Sharma (centre) at the Asia Economic Dialogue on Sunday

Pune: In future, large housing complexes will have an apt optical fibre infrastructure for better mobile connectivity.

Chairman of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) R S Sharma said his organization is in discussion with the urban development ministry on including such a provision in the National Building Code which lays down the guidelines for the regulation of building construction activity across the country.

Speaking at the Asia Economic Dialogue on Sunday, Sharma identified people’s reluctance and misgivings about cellphone towers and the absence of inbuilt optical fibre infrastructure in large housing societies as some of the issues contributing to the deteriorating quality of service and call drop problems faced by the telecom service users.

He said, “People do not want (mobile communication) towers, but they want connectivity. There is huge misgiving about cellphone towers causing cancer. Then, there is in building infrastructure. In large complexes, you can’t provide connectivity only through towers. Just like these complexes have infrastructure for electricity, water and gas distribution, you need to have similar infrastructure for optical fibre. We are discussing this with the ministry so that a provision is included in the National Building Code.”

Sharma said TRAI had tried introducing penalty to telecom service providers for each call drop and the law was upheld by the high court, but quashed by the Supreme Court. “We are since focusing on quality service testing, but it has a threshold and we are continuing to punish the service providers. Telecom companies are citing voice-free services to question to the extent they can be punished for free service. This may not be correct as they are cross-subsidizing,” he added.

He said, “People are not allowing companies to lay optical fibre over issues like right of way. A one-km opitcal fibre wire costs Rs 50,000, but it costs Rs1 crore in Mumbai. We hope things will get better soon.”

UPI goes international

National Payments Corporation of India’s (NPCI) MD and CEO Dilip Asbe said the NPCI was trying to see whether its Unified Payments Interface (UPI) can be made international. “As we speak, the first international transaction using an UPI app is being done in Singapore,” he told the audience. “Anybody can scan the QR code put up in Singapore merchant and pay using the vMAP,” he added.

The NPCI was set up as a financial technology company by the RBI and other banks. It has been working on architecture built on fully open source technology and it was now doing a majority of the transactions in India.

“Today, 1,400 banks as customers can receive direct benefit transfer money and 1,200 banks as customers are using the RuPay cards. In fact, Rupay has a one-third market share in terms of point of sale and e-commerce transactions. We want to make it number 1 in terms of volumes and values.”

They are working on real-time payments, having launched the IMPS in 2010 and after an initial period of trial, almost $30 billion are now being transacted every month using IMPS, he said. “The advent of smartphones spurred us to launch UPI in 2016 and today UPI is doing 30 billion transactions on a monthly basis,” he added.

Data security & privacy

TRAI chairman R S Sharma said that data security and privacy had always been a top priority for Aadhaar card system. Privacy has been ensured from the very design of the 12-digit Aadhaar number which is random and difficult in terms of doing any profiling. Highest level of security is deployed for data protection and it is ensure that no data is kept in an unencrypted form, he said.

Instead of May, the project is now expected to be completed by early July. If the public works department (PWD) sticks to its fourth deadline, the commute on Mathura Road, Ring Road and Bhairon Marg will become a smooth experience thanks to a 1.2km-long tunnel and six underpasses.The project seeks to make Mathura Road — from the ITO W-point to Delhi Public School — and the Bhairon Marg-Ring Road intersection signal-free through the underpasses. The tunnel, on the other hand, will connect India Gate to Ring Road through Purana Quila Road/Mathura Road.The main reason behind the delay is the construction ban imposed during the winter, said an official. The project budget, which was estimated at Rs 932 crore, has escalated at least to Rs 1,000 crore, he added.The six-lane tunnel will run under Pragati Maidan from Purana Qila Road to Ring Road, reducing almost half the snarls caused by three major traffic signals on the stretch. The unfinished section is outside the Pragati Maidan premises, an official added.The main beneficiaries will be the commuters heading for east Delhi from south and Lutyens’ Delhi through India Gate and ITO. The vehicles going towards south Delhi from ITO will also have access to the tunnel from Mathura Road, providing a much-needed alternative to Bhairon Marg, especially during peak hours. This will also eventually reduce the traffic volume at the ITO traffic signal.Around 800 meters of the tunnel, running under Pragati Maidan, has been completed. Of the rest, 200 meters are being dug up underneath railway tracks using the “box pushing method” — segments are cast outside and pushed through heavy embankments of rail or road — to leave the train schedule undisturbed, said an official. Two boxes will have to be pushed, and the work for the second box will be completed by the end of this month, he added.Two of the five underpasses on Mathura Road are near Sunder Nagar while three are between Pragati Maidan and the Supreme Court premises. The other underpass on Ring Road connects it to Bhairon Marg. According to an India Trade Promotion Organisation official, around 60% of the work for all underpasses has been completed.According to the plan, two elevated clover-leaf roundabouts on Ring Road are being built for south- and north-Delhi-bound vehicles emerging from the underpass. Both roundabouts are almost on the verge of completion.The U-turns at the Bhairon Marg and the Subramaniam Bharti Marg crossings are also being replaced with elevated U-turns, giving more space to the vehicles going towards ITO. Instead of traffic signals, the three crossings at Sher Shah Road, Bhairon Marg and Subramaniam Bharati Marg will have underpasses for south-bound vehicles. Two more U-turns will be constructed at Sunder Nagar.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74432437,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-212710,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/good-things-come-to-those-who-wait-pragati-maidan-revamp-gets-4th-date/articleshow/74431593.cms

MUMBAI: Nalasopara resident Seema Verma has made it to the winners’ podium at many running events over the last few years, but it’s her personal story of grit that inspires fellow-runners the most.

Verma, a 38-year-old single mother who survived an abusive marriage, worked as domestic help before one of the “memsahibs” helped her take up running professionally.

Today, Verma — mother of a 19-year-old boy — makes a living only out of running. While she refuses to reveal how much she earns, she said, “When I finish in the podium, I get something like Rs 20,000. Collectively, these earnings help me survive.” Considering that Verma finished on the podium in 14 of the races she ran through 2019, it would be safe to assume she made over Rs 2 lakh – considerably more than a domestic help would make in a year.

She isn’t yet an elite marathoner — a title that requires women to complete the 42-km run in roughly 3:05 hours — but she finished on the podium of the Tata Mumbai Marathon held in January with a timing of 3:52:58 hours.

Verma was married at when she was 17-years-old to an alcoholic who deserted her and their son within four years of their wedding. Forced to fend for herself and her toddler, Seema took up odd jobs, including being a househelp. One of her employers, who knew about Verma’s love for sports, exhorted her to take up running to supplement her income. Now, eight years after starting her journey as a runner, she only depends on running to survive.

He said this at a seminar — ‘Interface between environmental protection and development of transport infrastructure: Issues and challenges’ — at ILS Law College under its ILS Legal Aid Centre and ILS Hariyali: The Environment Law Cell.

Dharmadhikary said under the National Waterways Act passed by the Centre in 2016, 111 river stretches were declared ‘national waterways’. “It was launched in a systematic way and involved rivers passing through 24 states and two union territories,” he said.

Last year, Dharmadhikary said, there were talks that the Mula-Mutha would be included in the Act. “There were talks that the Centre would amend the legislation for this. It has not happened so far, maybe because they are not sure how it will work with the riverfront development project,” he said, adding the project was not feasible.

“The main reason is that the Mula-Mutha does not have enough water for this. Unless you release water from upstream dams, which is basically the city’s drinking water supply, one can’t do it. Creating the correct stagnant water-level, which is ideal for vessels to navigate will be tough,” he said.

A Raja William, a retail fish seller, who would sell fish for around Rs 1 lakh on a usual Sunday, but this week he found lull business as he sold for only Rs 40, 000.

It has affected sales by at least 50% in Karimedu fish market. Situation was no better in other fish markets in the city like Nelpettai, South Gate, Jaihindpura and K Pudur. Traders said that the impact was found in neighbouring districts like Sivaganga, Dindigul, Theni and Virudhunagar too.

Fish and other seafood are procured from Rameswaram, Tuticorin, Kanyakumari and Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu. They are also supplied from other states such as Kerala and Karnataka. Fresh water fish are procured from Andhra Pradesh, said traders.

“The sales got affected because of one or two greedy traders from other states and we severed ties with them. No fishermen or trader in the state use formalin,” Raja William said.

V Vanitha, a resident of Ponmeni, said that the news about presence of formalin shocked her family members and they decided to not go for fish this Sunday.

L Sundaram, president of Karimedu Commission Fish Vendors Association suspected that formalin could have been used by ice producers and said that they will be cautious while purchasing ice from factories.

“Outcome of the test conducted by food safety officials is a wake-up call for us. We are working on ways to prevent such issues in future. We will be extra cautious in providing quality fish to the society complying with the regulations laid down by food safety officials,” he said.

Food safety officials said that they continue to monitor for presence of formalin and quality of seafood sold in markets in Madurai and take appropriate action against traders, who don’t fall in line.

PUNE: The Chatushrungi police have arrested two men from the city for their alleged involvement in the murder of a dairy businessman (50), who had gone missing from Balewadi on February 17 and was found dead in the Manwath taluka of Parbhani district last week.

The police identified the duo as Vitthal Kale (32) and Narayan Rathod (40). The Parbhani police have arrested their accomplice.

Senior inspector of the Chatushrungi police Anil Shewale said businessman Rohidas Balwadkar had left his house on February 17 after informing his family that he was going to Gujarat to buy buffaloes.

He said, “His family members later lodged a missing person’s complaint with the police, as they were unable to contact him for a few days.”

The Manwath police found a decomposed body near Manwath on February 24. During the course of investigation for ascertaining the identity of the body, the police traced one of the suspects in Parbhani.

“He confirmed that the deceased person was Balwadkar and revealed the names of Kale and Rathod in connection with his death. He also told the police that the duo were in Pune. We arrested Kale and Rathod on Saturday after receiving information on their whereabouts from the Parbhani police,” Shewale said, adding, “The duo were handed to the Parbhani police.”

The officer said prima facie probe revealed that a woman relative of Kale was Balwadkar’s tenant. “He used to harass her, following which the woman and her family had to leave for their native place in Parbhani district. Based on a suspicion that Balwadkar was still harassing the woman, Kale and Rathod hatched a plan to kill him,” Shewale said.

“The duo called him to Parbhani on the pretext of discussing some workhim. Upon meeting him, Kale and Rathod hacked him to death with the help of their third accomplice,” Shewale added.

MADURAI: Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami has clarified that people can omit three questions that have been recently included in the NPR exercise as the details in Tamil Nadu would be collected on the same lines as done in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

He said that residents were free to omit the three newly added questions in the NPR form - language, place of birth of mother and father and details of Aadhaar and ration cards. “They need not submit any records,” he said. He added that the Centre has not said anything about NRC.

Speaking to reporters at Madurai airport, the chief minister said that NPR was implemented during BJP’s rule in 2003, when DMK was its ally then. On being asked about MNM (Makkal Needhi Maiyam) president Kamal Haasan’s statement that the government departments were not functioning well, he asked what Kamal knows about government departments. “The only department he knows is acting and he is not even a full-time politician,” he said, adding that if malpractice in any department is brought to light stringent action would be taken.

When asked about some political parties projecting as a farmer, he said that his primary source of income came from agriculture. “Otherwise, the only salary I have taken till date is of an MLA when I was an MLA, MLA pension when I was not MLA, apart from MP salary and pension,” he said. On being asked about the IT secretary’s decision to quit over the scheme to provide internet facility to over 12,000 villages in TN, he said that the secretary was still in office and that it was false propaganda by the opposition parties.

233,['2/03/2020'],Cases of stones in urinary tract have risen among dogs: IVRI,"Bareilly: Cases of urolithiasis -- formation of stones in the urinary tract and kidney – among dogs are increasing every year, according to scientists at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) here. Some breeds such as Yorkshire terrier, Lhasa Apso, Shih Tzu, Dalmatians, English Bulldogs and German Shepherd are more prone to the disease. Males are mostly affected than females, they say.

According to sources at the IVRI’s polyclinic, 65 cases of urolithiasis among dogs were reported in 2017-18 and it rose to 95 in 2018-19.

RK Singh, director, IVRI, told TOI, “Dog owners should be made aware about how to properly take care of a canine so that the possibility of urolithiasis can be minimized.”

Urolithiasis is a urinary tract disease in which crystals or stones form within the urinary tract and cause irritation, pain and possibly blockage. Some times they are formed in the kidney. Though there is no single cause of urolithiasis, veterinarians believe that bacterial infection in the bladder, diet deficient in Vitamin A and mineral imbalance and low intake of water are common factors. Besides hereditary factors and size of dog – small dogs are more susceptible – also result in urolithiasis.

Owners often fail to recognize the signs of the problem in the form of discoloured urine that could be due to urine pH or increased intestinal absorption of inorganic minerals. The dog may make frequent attempts to urinate but urine output is low. The dog may also display discomfort or pain while urinating.

Swapan Kumar Maiti, principal scientist, division of surgery, IVRI, said, “Urolith is known as precipitation and aggregation of crystalline and organic matrix at one or more locations anywhere in urinary tract due to oversaturation of urine with crystalloid substances. Uroliths in dogs is divided into four main mineral types -- urate (ammonium urate, sodium urate and uric acid), cysteine, struvites (magnesium and ammonium phosphate) and calcium (calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate).”

Of the four groups of uroliths, scientists said struvites are the most commonly urinary stones found in dogs. “However, there is an increasing incidence of calcium oxalate stones in dogs. It may happen due to excess calcium feeding and feeding of high oxalate diet. Besides, commercially available feed has less magnesium content. Due to less magnesium content, the high calcium content cannot be neutralized and hence, it causes mineral imbalance. Urates are more common among Daschunds. Besides, cysteine stone is a result of enhanced urine acidity due to high animal protein diet,” said Maiti.

Scientists said the medical treatment of urolithiasis vary considering the severity of the disease among dogs. “We first try to dissolve the stone but if medical dissolution fails, we surgically remove the stone,” said Maiti.

However, in Madurai, the parents of leap year babies at GRH said that the fact did not have an impact on them since they followed the Tamil calendar. As per the Tamil calendar, Feburay 29 this year fell on Masi 17. “My daughter delivered as per her due date, which was given as February 29. We had, even before her delivery, decided that we will celebrate the birthday as per Tamil calendar so there is no confusion,” said Kalavathy S from Sathyamoorthy Nagar in Madurai.

Her daughter, 24-year-old Iswarya M is having her first child. “Leap day or not we are all incredibly happy to welcome our beautiful girl,” added Kalavathy.

Some other parents on the hand are also looking at the Tamil star birthday date to celebrate the birthday of their leap day baby. The star birthday dates come on different dates every year on the English calendar.

SECUNDERABAD: Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) has discontinued bus services from ECIL towards Secunderabad via Neredmet, AS Rao Nagar and Sainikpuri, citing mounting losses. Officials said that it had become financially non-viable to run buses along this route due to lack of adequate vehicles, drivers and conductors.

However, termination of services has created resentment among passengers, as these buses ferried thousands. They said that bus no. 24E , which directly connected ECIL to Secunderabad, was one of the many services discontinued. The bus travelled from ECIL bus terminus towards Secunderabad bus station 2 via Sainikpuri, EME Centre, Tirmulgherry, Clock Towers.

“Most buses ply via Moulali, Lalaguda, Tarnaka towards Secunderabad. There are no buses now that covers the other side — AS Rao Nagar, Vayupuri, Tirmulgherry,” said Anitha Yadagiri, a commuter.

The bus operators said that because the routes were running fewer trips every day, expenses were sometimes more than revenue earned per trip. “TSRTC was spending almost Rs 58 per km on buses that were discontinued. We had fewer vehicles, drivers or conductors to ply, due to which the authorities decided to discontinue services” said Gopal, Kushaiguda bus depot manager.

Officials said that Hyderabad Metro Rail Ltd’s (HMRL) decision to introduce shuttle buses from Jubilee Bus Stop towards Radhika X Roads, ECIL and Anandbagh is likely to provide relief to commuters struggling due to discontinuation of these buses. Over 8,000 people are expected to take these three routes daily.

243,['2/03/2020'],How Sikhs helped end dispute involving mosque and gurdwara,"Muslims also returned the land that was donated by the Sikh side as a part of the peace deal

MEERUT: Sikhs and Muslims in Uttar Pradesh ’s Saharanpur have amicably resolved a bitter six-year-old land dispute involving a gurdwara and a dilapidated mosque due to the “efforts of the Sikh community to help Muslims during the recent Delhi riots”.

Four days after the representatives of the two communities in Saharanpur reached an amicable agreement in the long-standing land dispute, the Muslim community went a step further to reaffirm their commitment for communal bonhomie by returning the land that was donated by the Sikh side as a part of the peace deal.

“The masjid committee, as well as the Muslim community, have unanimously decided to return the land that was donated to us. We are moved by the efforts of the Sikh community and the way they lead from the front when it comes to helping the poor and destitute which we recently saw during the Delhi riots,” Muharram Ali, a representative from the Muslim side, told TOI.

The dispute began in 2014 when Sri Guru Singh Sabha Gurdwara committee started constructing an extension to the gurdwara on a plot it had bought. Members of the Muslim community objected to the move, claiming that a mosque once had once stood on the land. The dispute triggered one of worst communal clashes in the district in 2014, resulting in three deaths while an entire marketplace was gutted in arson. More than 200 people were booked.

On Wednesday, both communities had come to an agreement with Sikh representatives agreeing to buy a plot of land in a minority-dominated area for construction of a mosque there and the minority community representatives reciprocating by promising to perform kar seva in the expansion plan of the gurdwara. In a press conference jointly held by the representatives of both the communities on Sunday, Ali returned the cheque to the members of the Sikh community present there.

“The community representatives have returned the documents and a cheque of Rs 4 lakh which was the first installment for the land that was being bought in the Muslim neighbourhood for the mosque,” Gurpreet Bagga, state unit president of Akali Dal, said. “They said that the Sikh community has always stood for the cause of others like we started langar in Delhi for the riot victims recently. We are thankful to them,” Bagga said.

“Tamil Nadu is a garden of peace where people of all creeds and castes lived in harmony. The government functioned on the basis of secularism and continued to protect the minority sections.

The students will kick-start their exams with the language paper on Monday.

At the 120 designated exam centres in the district, a total of 17,089 boys and 19,204 girls will write their exams. Following the overall state trend of more girls appearing for the exams, in Madurai, 2115 more girls are appearing when compared to boys. Strict restrictions are also in place to prevent cheating.

A preparatory meeting was held by district education officials last week led by Madurai district Chief Educational Officer (CEO) R Swaminathan to discuss the various measures in place in Madurai for smooth conduct of the exams. Various steps to prevent any leakage of question papers and ensuring that question papers and answer sheets were safe during transportation and storage was also discussed. The 13 strong rooms storing the question papers in the district will be under 24x7 armed guard security. The question papers will be transported via 28 special officers. There students will be writing their exams based on a new syllabus this year. Also they will be writing their exams for 100 marks instead of 200 marks. After an uproar over the time limit for the exams being reduced to two and a half hours instead of three, it was reverted back to 3 hours.

“It is going to be a completely new experience for us, from marks to syllabus, there has been a lot of change and we are not sure of what to expect. We did our best in training them, now it is their time to shine,” said a principal of a school.

Nagpur: Nandanvan police have booked a man on charges of obstructing garbage collectors (on government duty) from discharging their duty and also threatening drivers of garbage collection vehicles on Saturday at Wathoda Chowk.

According to police, AG Enviro, which has been given contract to collect garbage by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), has a parking space for garbage collection vehicles at Wathoda Chowk. On Saturday, the accused identified as Mukesh Shahu went to the parking space and started threatening the drivers who were about to go to the work. He also threatened the parking in-charge Manoj Khankure.

This led to a delay of around two hours as the garbage vehicles were heldup. Following this, Manoj approached Nandanvan police station and filed a complaint.

It is learnt that Mukesh, a resident of Sonba Nagar, also has old offences registered against him, including at Kalamna police station.

Senior PI of Nandanvan police station Sandipan Pawar said, “The reason behind Mukesh’s action is unclear, but he claims to be from a workers’ union. Mukesh could have informed the police about his grievance. Instead, he interfered in the work of garbage collectors and hence we have booked him. He has not been arrested in the matter.”

Hearing the plea, a division bench comprising Chief Justice A P Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad observed that the counsel for the petitioner had advanced his submissions, which essentially, in our opinion, is asking for the conduct of manjuvirattu events throughout the year. The judges observed that this is an absolutely irrational suggestion, seeking a legal protection for continuance of activities thereby diluting the very effect and purpose of the Act.

The judges further observed that any such alteration would, therefore, defeat the very purpose of regulating the activities of the events and might possibly result in more cruelty to the animals that presently involved, which is sought to be prevented. Observing that the aforesaid relief claimed is frivolous for having raised an issue, which does not further any public interest, the judges dismissed the petition.

The petitioner M C Pandi was appointed as grade II police constable in the year 1988. The petitioner while serving as a head constable was issued a charge memo alleging that he along with a person had leaked the question paper for police constable recruitment examination to M Suresh by obtaining Rs 10,000 in the year 2005.

Based on the report submitted by the inquiry officer, the disciplinary authority had imposed a punishment of reduction of pay by one stage for two years with cumulative effect for the petitioner. When the petitioner filed an appeal, the appellate authority in the year 2011 had enhanced the punishment to dismissal from service. Aggrieved by the same, the petitioner had filed a review and in the order in 2014, the punishment was modified as compulsory retirement. Hence, the petitioner moved high court Madurai bench in the year 2014, challenging these orders and sought to reinstate him back in to service.

Justice J Nisha Banu observed that on perusal of the records, the punishment given by the disciplinary authority to the petitioner can be reasonably accepted. The judge, however, observed that the appellate authority had dismissed the appeal moved by the petitioner twice without discussing any grounds raised by the petitioner. The judge observed that though the petitioner stated to have been committed serious misconduct by the appellate authorities, the fact remains that he has not been arrayed as accused in the criminal case. The judge observed that while similarly placed people have been given only minor punishment, the appellate authority has imposed severe punishment without any concrete material that too, belatedly.

Confirming the punishment order passed by the disciplinary authority, the judge set aside the order passed by the appellate authorities and directed them to reinstate the petitioner in service with all service and monetary benefits within a period of four weeks.

255,['2/03/2020'],Going for the skill: Helping youths land better jobs,"Hyderabad: While the demand for jobs is ever growing, the skills fresh graduates possess are often found wanting.

Gampa Nageshwar Rao realised this was true for almost all generations over past many decades. He also understood that youths, despite being armed with various Bachelors or PG degrees, either lacked confidence or direction.

Rao, 58, says, “I drove autorickshaws. I used to distribute milk and newspapers to afford an education. Nobody was there to guide me when I was young. When I completed my education, I knew I had to do something to support others like me.” He knew that youths needed to be armed with soft skills to excel in their careers.

About 22 years ago, Rao, set up ‘Impact’, a foundation that provides free training to youths in public speaking, spoken English, positive body language, entrepreneurship, and even guidance in how to build a resume.

“The training sessions we provide are free of cost. People only have to register themselves on our website,” says Rao, who is an LIC employee. Under the foundation, he conducts various programmes where he helps graduates develop their soft skills.

The training programmes are held in collaboration with professionals from different fields.

“We have several groups on social media so that we never lose contact with those coming for our sessions. These groups also include professionals from different walks of life who can reply to the queries,” says Rao. A young participant at his training programme, said he has realised that instead on just focusing on educational degree, youths must focus on ethics and job satisfaction.

“I met Mr Rao 10 years ago,” says 34-year-old Sai Satish, who is an ethical hacker. “I was a fresh graduate who lacked confidence and communication skills. He helped me rebuild my confidence. Today, I have a very positive approach towards life, and I own a software developing company of my own.”

The intention behind this initiative, says Rao, is to show the young minds that there are may options in life, which they can explore if they develop their skills.

Madurai: While the government has assured the people, that it would close the Tasmac shops in a phased manner, the establishment of a new shop at the 80 feet road in Anna Nagar, Madurai is a cause of concern.

Social activist, S Karthik said that people continue to protest against setting up of Tasmac shops in various parts of the city, but the administration continues to establish them, in various important places. On Feb 27, this year, people of Kochadai protested against the move to open a shop opposite to a temple there. Two days later, a similar protest was held against opening a Tasmac shop near the third bus stop in the region in Thirunagar on February 29.

Now, work is on to open a shop on the 80 feet road in Anna Nagar, which is about 100 feet away from SP Hospitals. This road houses about five hospitals, and educational institutions.

“As hospitals are on this stretch, this road is frequented by ambulances. The establishment of a Tasmac shop here could lead to accidents,’’ said B Anandraj, a resident.

Establishing these shops in crowded places which would definitely cause a problem and be a menace to the public should be avoided. People from Panangadi, Bypass road, and Surveryor Colony had moved the court against the establishment of Tasmac shops near schools or hospitals in these places and obtained a stay against the opening the shops in specific places.

Soundaraya, a resident of Anna Nagar says that her daughter returns from tuition very near to the spot where the shop is being established. “Many students use the lane, and now we have to look for alternatives because a Tasmac shop is never safe for children to walk past after 9 pm,’’ she said.

C J Rajan, convenor of Tamil Nadu Federation of Anti-liquor movements said that the establishment of tasmac shops show that the government is not committed to fulfilling the statements made by their late leader J Jayalalithaa. “The matter of concern is that they are opening them at prime locations which are frequented by the general public, which could endanger them,’’ he said.

260,['2/03/2020'],"Pune: 70-year-old woman, son survive house collapse","A big portion of the century-old Singhaniya Wada collapsed early on Sunday morning

PUNE: A man (48) and his septuagenarian mother had a miraculous escape after a major portion of a century-old wada, located near the Shrimant Dagaduseth Halwai Ganapati temple on Shivaji Road, collapsed around 5am on Sunday.

Vinayak Kalyani and Gangubai (70) remained under the debris of the Singhaniya Wada in Budhwar Peth for around an hour before fire brigade officers spotted them. The fire brigade officers said Vinayak and Gangubai were sleeping in their room on the first floor of the dilapidated building when the ceiling, made of Mangalore tiles and wood, crashed. The floor of their room also caved in and the duo fell onto the ground floor of the wada.

Fire station officer Pradip Khedekar said his department received a call around 5.17am and his team rushed to the spot. “While removing the debris, some of our officers heard the sound of human breathing. They then spotted the two persons. There was very little space for them even to crawl out,” he said.

The fire brigade officers made a makeshift platform close to the first floor of the wada and a team used it to reach the ground floor. “The team removed the debris and took out Vinayak and Gangubai. We used bedsheets and blankets to rescue them, as there was no space to enter the wada with stretchers. Both of them had sustained minor injuries and were taken to a nearby hospital,” he said.

The local residents said the wada had nearly nine rooms and most of them were damaged. Few of the rooms were occupied.

In July last year, a section of a staircase and the connected wall of a 75-year-old wada in Ghorpade Peth had collapsed. Fire brigade officials rescued 22 residents. The residents were trapped inside, as they could not descend because the stairs were in a dangerous condition.

Barely a month after the accident, the wall of a dilapidated wada in Guruwar Peth collapsed, rendering its lone resident homeless.

The state government had in 2015 drafted a policy to provide certificates to ensure that leaseholders’ rights were protected. According to the policy, the leaseholders can keep their claim on the structures by submitting the certificate at the time of the wadas’ redevelopment.

Pune city has around 775 wadas and other dilapidated properties. Of these, around 174 are in a dangerous condition. The state government has divided the structures into C-1 (very dangerous), C-2A (needs vacating for repair), C-2B (Doesn’t need vacating for repair) and C-3 (Needs minor repairing) categories.

MUMBAI: Rashmi Thackeray , considered to be one of the driving forces behind husband Uddhav and son Aaditya’s plunge in active politics, seems to have now assumed a more direct role in Shiv Sena ’s affairs.

On Sunday, her name appeared in the print line of party mouthpiece Saamna as its editor. Sena MP Sanjay Raut will continue as the daily’s executive editor and see to its day-to-day operations, a party member said. Rashmi replaces Uddhav, who stepped down as the editor and his name was dropped from its print line on November 28, 2019 the day he took oath as Maharashtra ’s chief minister. This was done to avoid the ‘office of profit’ issue.

262,['2/03/2020'],Quelossim locals miffed at NOC to project in CRZ,"Panaji: The issuance of a no-objection certificate ( NOC ) by the Quelossim panchayat secretary for a floating platform at the mini India park has kicked off a row, as the villagers have been opposing the project, located in the coastal regulation zone ( CRZ ) – 1, for nearly a decade.

In a series of developments recently, the secretary issued approval for the floating platform on February 11, but then, revoked it in a letter issued on the eve of a gram sabha on February 16.

Facing queries from gram sabha members about the non-transparent process, secretary Narayan Azgaonkar apologised at the meeting chaired by sarpanch Maria D’Souza.

But in another twist, Azgaonkar filed a police complaint, alleging that D’Souza and deputy sarpanch Sebastiao Serrao had forcibly taken away the outward correspondence register to make entries in it.

The matter is still simmering, with the villagers crying foul over the secretary’s latest action. Allegedly with political backing, Azgaonkar issued another letter dated February 20 to the private party, withdrawing the letter cancelling the NOC.

The approval granted on February 11 stands valid, the letter states.

“We will now approach the higher authorities,” said Lopinho Xavier, a local activist.

A large patch in a fertile khazan land under survey number 170/0 had been reclaimed many years ago. The project envisaged installation of replicas of India’s well-known religious monuments. Though the investment promotion board had issued an in-principle approval to it, it later withdrew it after a court litigation.

The Goa coastal zone management authority had declared, after a few inspections, that the land is part of CRZ 1, but as locals allege, it has not submitted the last report for further action.

264,['2/03/2020'],Nagpur: Key to nailing history lies in the textbook,"Representative image

As the history syllabus is vast, the major challenge for a student is to complete the portion on time. Students therefore get tempted to study from guidebooks and not refer to the textbooks at all. I would advise students not to commit this blunder.

As per the new pattern, the question paper comprises of 20 objective type questions which need a thorough reading of the textbook. Chapters on kinship, caste and class, Harappan civilization, colonial cities, partition and Mahatma Gandhi and the national movement should be studied thoroughly for this section. While going through the chapters, the student should also study the pictures especially in Book 1 and Book 2.

The picture illustrations of thinker, beliefs and buildings, Vijaynagar empire, colonial city, Bhakti-Sufi traditions are very important for picture based MCQ. Moreover the meanings of certain ancient and medieval terms like ‘Milkiyat’, ‘Daftar’, ‘Mleccha’, ‘Rakshasa’, etc also need to be learnt for this section to score full marks.

The source based questions will test the comprehension skills of the student. So use the reading time to read the paragraphs carefully and read all the questions pertaining to the paragraph before writing the answers. Try to search the answers from the paragraph. Sometimes you might not find the answer in the paragraph. In such cases, you need to recollect the content of the chapter from where the source has been taken.

Every student should be able to score well in the map based questions as the they already know the places that they are expected to locate and identify. For 3 mark and 8 mark questions, I would advise you to jot down the points while learning the answers instead of memorizing word to word which is often the tendency among students.

Jotting down the key points will not only give you clarity but will also help you to remember during the exam. Try to adhere to the word limit and attempt all questions without fail.

Finally, it is necessary to remain calm. Your mind works better when you are calm. All the best!

265,['2/03/2020'],‘TN is no Delhi to unleash attacks on minorities’,"Chennai: At the forefront of anti-CAA campaign Nagapattinam MLA and Manithaneya Jananayaga Katchi leader Thamimun Ansari , who contested on the AIADMK symbol, said empty threats of the BJP leaders will not scare Muslims . Hailing TN as the land of social reformist Periyar, Ansari in an interview with TOI, said protesters were prepared to stand their ground till the summer of 2024 and would join hands with Periyarists, Ambedkarists and Marxists to face the fascists

Q: Despite the PM, home minister and CM of TN saying that CAA will not affect minorities in anyway, why are there innumerable protests?

We wanted to see who is saying this. These people said they will not demolish Babri Masjid and that they would only offer pujas. But they demolished it the very next day (in 1992). Besides this, the BJP with its majoritarianism is functioning as per the direction of the RSS. So, the citizens of the country are not ready to believe their words.

As for Tamil Nadu, I agree that chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and other AIADMK leaders are concerned about minorities. But we cannot rely on their assurances as they are unable to protect their own party from the BJP. When they are not able to protect themselves how can they protect others? In such a scenario, the anti-CAA protests are gaining momentum and spreading to different parts of the state. People from different walks of life are also joining us in our fight.

Q: Why are minorities scared of CAA, NPR and NRC ?

Nineteen lakh people were affected after NRC was implemented in Assam. Of these, 12 lakh were Hindus. The NRC exercise carried out in Assam has led to degradation of society. It left out 17 of the family members of former President Fakhurddin Ali Ahmed, besides former Assam CM Syeda Anwara Taimur and Kargil veteran Mohammad Sanallulah. So, we are strongly against the implementation of NRC. We are fighting for the people of other religions and faith, not for us alone. We want citizenship for Sri Lankan Tamils too.

After strong protests against NRC, the Centre is trying to bring it through the back door by adding six controversial questions from NRC to NPR. We are not against NPR that was formulated during the regime of former PMs Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh. But we cannot allow the present format. We are also not against the census that is conducted once every 10 years.

Q: The BJP and its ally AIADMK are saying the DMK and the Congress are carrying out a misinformation campaign to instigate Muslims for political gain. Your view?

It is wrong to say the DMK, the Congress and the communist parties are instigating minorities. They are only extending their support to the people’s movement against CAA and taking part in it. If what this government says is true, then why are BJP allies like the Shiromani Akali Dal, Nitish Kumar’s JD(U), and the PMK opposing it.

Q: A few BJP leaders have cautioned that Delhi kind of violence will unfold in TN if the state fails to quell protests. They have demanded a ban on anti-CAA protests. Your comment?

I urge the Tamil Nadu government to invoke the National Security Act against people speaking in such a manner to instigate violence. Meanwhile, I can say that they can only threaten and make empty noise, but fascist forces never had the power to defeat a people’s movement. Delhi is not Tamil Nadu. We will join hands with Periyarists, Ambedkarists and Marxists in the state and face the fascists.

Q: The opposition parties and AIADMK ally the PMK have urged the TN government to pass a resolution against CAA. The CM is firm that it will not affect minorities. Even if the government passes such a resolution, how helpful will it be?

By casting 11 votes, the AIADMK had played a big role in leading the country into a destructive path and disturbed the peace of the country. Bihar CM Nitish Kumar had also committed the same blunder, but he changed his stand and is trying to correct it. We urge the AIADMK government to change its stand by passing a resolution against CAA. By doing so, the state government will give a minimum guarantee that it will not harm the people.

Q: Unlike yesteryears, Muslim women are participating in large numbers in the protests. Women in Tamil Nadu have replicated the Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh style protest. What has brought this change?

Muslim women across the country are educated these days and are keenly following the media. Education and political awareness among them have brought them to the streets to fight for their rights and that of fellow citizens.

Q: Since the AIADMK supported the bill in Parliament, are you regretting supporting this government during critical times?

Former CM J Jayalalithaa was a follower of social justice. So, we joined the AIADMK under her leadership. But, the present AIADMK leadership is going against its own ideology, because of which we came out of the alliance ahead of the Lok Sabha elections last year. We have no regrets. In fact, it gave us a sense of satisfaction to fight for a cause and ideology. By doing so, we are reflecting the conscience of the people of the state.

Tyagi and his family was supposed to return to India via Dubai but was rendered helpless after Dubai cancelled all incoming flights from Iran due to outbreak of new coronavirus.

“They have contacted the Indian embassy in Tehran. The officials are in touch with them and hopefully, help will reach them soon,” Ilahi added.

The family was on a pilgrimage to Imam Reza shrine, the mausoleum of Imam Reza, the eighth Imam of Twelver Shiites, in Mashhad, Khorasan-e-Razavi.

Meanwhile, Iran’s health ministry on Sunday raised the nationwide death toll from the new coronavirus to 54 as the number of infected cases jumped overnight to 978 people.

Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said new cases were confirmed in a number of cities, including Mashhad, which is home to Iran's most important Shiite shrine that attracts pilgrims from across the region. Calls by Iran's civilian government to clerics to close such shrines to the public have not been uniformly followed.

The virus, which originated in central China, has infected at least seven government officials in Iran.

268,['2/03/2020'],State to come down heavily on illegal sale of drugs online,"Thiruvananthapuram: The state government is gearing up to take strict action against unauthorized sale of medicines through online platforms. Health minister K K Shailaja said the government was committed to putting the breaks on such dangerous and unauthorized sales of drugs.

The support and cooperation of the Union government was essential to ebb out the unhealthy tendency reportedly taking roots in the state, she said.

“The state government alone could not clamp total restrictions on the online sale of medicines . In 2019, the state drugs control department had issued a blanket ban against international drug major Medlife International that had been selling medicines across the state via online platform. Now, it has come to our notice that the activities of the company and similar ones are still prevalent in the state. Despite the limitations, the state government is putting serious efforts to eliminate the online drug sale to a possible extent. The practice of taking medicines unrestrictedly, not based on any authentic prescriptions from registered medical practitioners could be mortally harmful. All concerned should keep a vigil against such tendencies. The public should also be aware of the same,” the minister said.

As per the Drugs And Cosmetics Act 1940, Drugs And Cosmetics Rules 1945, online sale of medicine is not permissible. However, following media reports regarding rampant online sales of drugs, the department had carried out widespread investigations. “It has come to the fore that all the companies and agencies that are engaged in online sale of drugs are operating from outside Kerala. Often, they provide drugs without any valid prescriptions. The drugs controller had intimated his counterparts in those states from where the drug sales companies operate. However, requests for action against the companies did not elicit any positive result,” she said.

Unrestricted use of allopathy medicines, especially antibiotics, sleeping pills, medicines for mental illnesses and sexual stimulants are highly dangerous.

Over-the-counter sale of such medicines are effectively restricted and monitored by the state drugs control department. However, the menace could be effectively curbed only if the Union government takes steps to carry out changes in the laws concerned, making the unbridled online sale of drugs a criminal offence.

269,['2/03/2020'],Pune: Hardeep Singh Puri says auto sector no indicator of economic slowdown,"Hardeep Singh Puri (second from left) at the Asia Economic Dialouge on Sunday

PUNE: Union minister for housing, urban development and civil aviation Hardeep Singh Puri on Sunday said the automotive sector could not be a decisive indicator of economic slowdown in the country.

Figures from other sectors, including housing and civil aviation, “bust the false narrative” about an economic slowdown in the country, Puri said at the valedictory session of the Asia Economic Dialogue organised by the Pune International Centre here.

He was responding to the discussion at a preceding session with Ola Cabs cofounder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal, who was asked about finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman’s comment in September last year, blaming the millennials for the slump in car sales.

A former diplomat-turned-politician, Puri said apart from goods and services, technology was making a big impact on global trade and India must place a “laser like focus” on enabling a settling operation of mammoth scale in network products.

He said, “China’s remarkable export performance has much to do with a deliberate specialization in the large-scale labour intensive network products produced across global value chains operated by multinational companies.”

On the slowdown, Puri said about two-and-a-half years ago when he became a minister, the Delhi Metro rail had a ridership of 2.4 million passengers a day and the number has now increased to 6.5 million per day. He said, “One can get a pretty good picture of what mobility is all about if we calculate the increase in Ola and Uber ridership during this period. Certain high-end vehicles were sold, but some others could not be sold because of technical specifications, such as BS-IV and BS-VI requirements.”

The minister said, “A Mckenzie report of 2010 stated India was adding 700-900 million square metre of urban space every year, which is equivalent to a Chicago. Looking at our flagship housing sector, the objective was to build 1 crore units by 2022. But our committee for monitoring and sanctioning of projects, which met in December last year, had already sanctioned 1 crore homes in a span of three months. We are now into assessment of the revised demand.”

Puri said, “In civil aviation, the Pune airport is handling 9 million passengers every year and plans to move towards the 16 million passengers every year with a demand for more flights. India is already the 3rd largest domestic civil aviation market with 435 million passengers throughout per year. The country is now looking at one billion passengers per year. We will add 100 new airports and the number of civil aircraft has gone up from less than 600 in 2018-19 to 750 as of now. We are adding two-three aircraft per week and a private airline has ordered 300 aircraft. Do these figures look like economic slowdown?”

On global trade and economy, Puri said the Asian continent continued to be shaped by China (with a GDP of $14 trillion), Japan ($5trillion), the vibrant and dynamic economies of south-east Asian countries, the Republic of Korea and a growing Indian economy, which is already 5th largest in the world and seeks to transform from the $2.89 trillion economy to $5 trillion by 2024 and $10 trillion by 2030.

He, however, said any debate on Asia must factor in the domestic political realities and the impact of trade decisions on livelihood and stability.

Niti Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar identified new binding carbon constraints, new technology and inequality between economies as the key challenges of the 21st century vis-à-vis development and trade. “Emerging economies can no longer follow the models of the developed countries. There has to be a push for electric mobility and electric shared and connected mobility,” he said, adding India should not shy away from openness and multilateral trading.

Maharashtra minister for environment Aditya Thackeray spoke about the “reverse movement of thought and innovation” in Asia and India and the economic opportunity it presented to the country. “Balancing environment and economy is also a challenge and the state government is working towards striking an apt balance.

270,['2/03/2020'],Pune civic body shuts down illegal transfer of funds for projects and locations,"The PMC circular refers to a September 2018 notice and says any digression will end up in the project being sc... Read More

PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has clamped down on unauthorised movement of funds for municipal works. Internal transfer of public funds for civic works, made by corporators among themselves, has also been barred.

Henceforth, projects will be scrapped, if those works or funds allocated to them are shifted from one municipal ward to another, without proper process and permissions. The move was made to avoid misuse of public money under the garb of transfers.

The elected members get budgetary provisions to carry out development works in their wards. Funds are given through the main office and from the ward offices. The rights to approve financial aid for projects are vested with civic officials if the provisions are less. The green signal from the civic standing committee and general body are a must for bigger projects.

“Projects are designed for a particular ward or location. The money is allotted to them accordingly. These funds need to be moved after due approvals. Then tenders are supposed to be issued and work orders allotted. But some elected members have transferred the works or funds on their own without carrying out due process. Technically, all such transfers are unauthorised,” a senior PMC official said.

He added that the money allotted for the projects should be spent in the given financial year. If not approved, the funds can lapse. Sometimes, the PMC has given extensions to the municipal budget for three to four months. The aim was to make sure that funds are utilised properly.

The municipal commissioner’s office, referring to a September 2018 circular, in the last week of February issued a notice regarding any change of place in the municipal works. The older circular had highlighted that only in case of an emergency can works can be transferred from one place to another.

“Hereafter, those works for which tenders and work orders have been issued should not be transferred. If the project cannot be carried out at the proposed site due to some issue, then that tenders should be scrapped. The department heads of the PMC should follow this order strictly,” municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad said in the circular.

272,['2/03/2020'],Board counsellors take off pressure,"Pune: Counsellors appointed by the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education have been flooded with calls from students and parents as well.

The counsellors said they get around 15 to 20 calls a day.

The state board has appointed 10 counsellors whose contact numbers were recently published online for the benefit of the students.

The counsellors have welcomed the idea of parents calling up as it showed a supportive attitude among them towards their children.

A counsellor Gayatri Wani said, “The students who call are not asking about whether they will pass or not. Their main worry is whether they will meet their target or not. Now, parents have become a lot more supportive. They have been calling and asking questions. When parents feel better after talking to us they tell their wards to call too.”

Sagar Gaikwad, who has been counselling for the past three years spoke about anxiety in students.

“The calls are generally from students who are scared about the examinations, who feel they will not be able to perform well or they will not be able to meet their parents’ expectations. Sometimes, after talking to the students, we talk to parents too telling them how they can be more supportive. The calls will increase around the result time as fear of result is another trigger” Gaikwad said.

Another counsellor Smita said that in the first week when the contact numbers were published, the calls by students were mostly about technical doubts such as exam centres or hall tickets. However, once that settled, the calls were increasingly about exam stress and anxiety.

273,['2/03/2020'],IGNCA to get temporary home at Delhi's Janpath Hotel,"IGNCA will operate from the hotel for 2 years

NEW DELHI: Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts ( IGNCA ) is set to shift from its current location on Man Singh Road to a temporary address at Janpath Hotel in June. It will be operating from the hotel for two years, while a permanent complex is created at Jamnagar House on Shah Jahan Road.

The hotel, which was shut down in November 2017, will be revamped to meet the requirement.

Ram Bahadur Rai, president of IGNCA, said, “Janpath Hotel has been taken over by CPWD and work on refurbishing the entire place and developing areas as per our needs is under way. It will have provisions for a library, laboratories, classrooms, a studio for audio-visual recording, exhibition space, conference room, guest house and an auditorium with a capacity for 200 people.”

The IGNCA building and nine others, among them Udyog Bhawan, Nirman Bhawan, Shastri Bhawan and the vice-president’s residence, are planned to be demolished to pave the way for the redevelopment of the Central Vista. The new permanent campus for IGNCA will come on a plot where Jamnagar House hutments are now located.

A panel is being set up to oversee the safe shifting of the arts institution’s collection of books, paintings and manuscripts. IGNCA has been bequeathed the library collections of 28 eminent Indians, including Namwar Singh, Kapila Vatsyayan, Hazari Prasad Dwivedi and Suniti Kumar Chatterji. It also has rare paintings. The centre organises cultural events, conferences and academic activities.

“These activities will continue at our makeshift office,” said Dr Sachchidanand Joshi, member-secretary, IGNCA. “It’s just that the overall space will be less than at our existing complex, where we have a huge basement storage. So, we will need to plan properly about collections to display and those to keep in storage.”

Joshi was amenable to the temporary convenience, saying, “Everything is happening for a better future”. He said that two years, IGNCA would have a bigger and permanent address at Jamnagar House. “Around 15 acres of land have been earmarked for the construction of a new building, which will have all facilities to meet our requirements of the next 30 years.”

Joshi claimed that the current building had only a third of the facilities and infrastructure that the institution actually required. “The auditorium is small, the conference room has pillars standing in the middle and often proving a hindrance to the smooth conduct of an event. Most importantly, there is much open space that is not serving any purpose,” said Joshi.

The IGNCA management has visited the office of the architectural firm redesigning Central Vista and redeveloping Jamnagar House.

The temporary relocation of IGNCA is necessary as the government is planning to build the first modern office block on the land which is now occupied by the government-funded arts organisation. “Since the built-up area in this plot is very less, so demolishing them and starting fresh construction can start early. Once the office block is built on this plot, offices from a couple of existing Bhawans along Rajpath can be shifted to the new building. Subsequently, we can start reconstruction of these empty buildings,” said a source.

Officials said the construction of new office buildings will be taken up in a phased manner so that there is less displacement of people. They added that the offices operating from the Jamnagar House hutments and other such complexes in the area will be shifted to a new building, which will come up on a vacant plot on the Kasturba Gandhi Marg and some of these establishments will also be shifted to an office building in Africa Avenue in south Delhi.

Meanwhile, TOI has learnt that the central public works department (CPWD), has bid out the work for shifting of the present reception area and other facilities at Parliament complex to make enough land available for construction of new Parliament. They added the makeshift reception will move close to the existing Parliament. The relocation of reception area will start soon.

274,['2/03/2020'],"Water billing for only 50% of supply in Nagpur, of which half is unpaid","Representative image

NAGPUR: Even after running amnesty schemes and giving over a decade to consumers, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Orange City Water Private Ltd (OCW) have failed to recover Rs194 crore water bill arrears from government, civic establishments and residential and commercial property owners as on January 31, 2020.

As per NMC-OCW data, the civic body is lifting around 740 MLD from Pench reservoirs and Kanhan river but of the total water supplied to meet city’s requirement, billing is done only for 370 MLD (50%).

The city has total 3.61 lakh water consumers. Out of them, 1.7 lakh consumers are defaulters. The arrears indicate that 50% of the billed water has gone unpaid, taking the non-revenue water (NRW) figure to a staggering 75%.

Disconnecting 4,293 consumers led to recovery of Rs14.71 crore so far.

As per the data, the revenue from water supply for the current financial year is Rs116.24 crore against a target of Rs166 crore.

Outgoing NMC water works chairman Pintu (Vijay) Zalke admitted that the civic body has failed to remove the backlog for over a decade now. He, however, said that Rs142 crore arrears were recovered this fiscal,” he told TOI.

Zalke said that under his watch, 33,000 illegal connection were detected and 8,000 of them snapped after following due process. He said after taking over as new standing committee chief on March 5, he will initiate measures for the recovery of Rs194 crore “in a fair manner” along with other works.

Mayor Sandip Joshi attributed the arrears to a couple of reasons, including faulty billing, delay in setting up new connections and ignorance of consumers. “The problem lies in billing pattern of NMC as disputes are not settled fast. At the same time, defaulters too have now become used to not paying dues at all. Therefore, the arrears keep increasing though recovery is an ongoing process,” he said.

Joshi agreed that its high time to take tough decision to fix the problem of non-payment as well as NRW. “OCW will be held responsible for NRW. It could recover only up to 50 to 70 MLD of the unbilled water. These issues would be raised during the meeting of Nagpur Environmental Services Limited (NMC’s special purpose vehicle for water works) this month,” he said.

Zalke too said a new policy is needed as one time settlement (OTS) or amnesty scheme too has failed to make impact. “Immediate disconnection is one solution but due time for filing objections will be given. NRW stands at 52%, and efforts are on to bring it down to minimum. During review meeting of all departments as standing panel chairman, water works will be on priority,” he said.

OCW spokesperson said the agency has been conducting mass disconnection drive against defaulters and illegal consumers. “Every day, stern action is taken against around 300 defaulters and around 200 illegal consumers. NMC is in the process of providing police protection as and when required beside administrative support during the drive,” the spokesperson said.

OCW has planned a 12-hour shutdown of Chinchbhuvan, Pratap Nagar and Khamla ESR for installation of 500 MM diameter valves on inlet of Chinchbhuvan and Khamla ESR on March 2 (Monday). The shutdown will be from 10am to 10pm the same day. Areas receiving supply from Chinchbhuvan, Pratap Nagar and Khamla ESR will be affected due to no water.

275,['2/03/2020'],Hearing on Goa’s crucial Mhadei plea in Supreme Court today,"Supreme Court

PANAJI: A crucial hearing in the Mhadei water diversion case is likely to come up in the Supreme Court on Monday following the state government’s application seeking interim relief by restraining Karnataka from carrying out construction or any other activity on the Mhadei.

Last week, the state government approached the apex court to seek a direction to Karnataka that it should not approach any authorities for permission till the matter is heard in court.

The government also sought direction from the Supreme Court to Karnataka to stop diversion of water. Chief minister Pramod Sawant had demanded a joint inspection headed by the chief engineer of the central water commission or assessor of the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal to expose Karnataka’s illegalities.

The state approached the Supreme Court in view of reports that Karnataka would move to start work on its Kalasa-Bhandura water drinking projects on the Mhadei following the court’s interim order.

Last week, the Supreme Court, in an interim order, directed the Centre to notify the MWDT’s August 14, 2018 award, but said it was subject to the outcome of the petitions filed by the riparian states — Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra — against the award.

Based on the Supreme Court’s direction, the Union government notified the award on February 28.

The Supreme Court also admitted the Goa government’s special leave petition challenging the award and posted it for final hearing on July 15, 16 and 22.

Sawant had said that during the hearings in the apex court in July, the state government will furnish enough evidence to prove that Karnataka has illegally diverted water from the Mhadei basin.

In August 2018, the three-decade-old dispute between three states — Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Goa — over sharing of the Mhadei waters ended with the tribunal rejecting Karnataka’s demand for 36.5 tmc, and allotted it only 13.4 tmc, including 3.9 tmc for drinking purposes through diversions, against its demand for 7.5 tmc.

Goa, in the special leave petition, wants the tribunal award allotting 3.9 tmc to Karnataka for drinking quashed.

277,['2/03/2020'],Work on platform for artisans to start soon,"Pune: The work on ‘Kalagram’ — a dedicated open-air market in the city to display handicraft and items showcasing cultures from across the country — is set to start.

The cultural space is inspired by the Dilli Haat in New Delhi and will be built on a 3.5 acre piece of land at the P L Deshpande garden near Sinhagad Road.

“The work on the project would start soon. The market would have 28 stalls and would provide a space for the artists and craftsmen to exhibit their produce from across the country, including Maharashtra. The idea is to build the market on the lines of Dilli Haat. The project is likely to near completion in next 6-7 months’ time,” chief garden superintendent of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) Ashok D Ghorpade told TOI.

The first Dilli Haat was established in 1994 as a platform for artisans from the remotest corners of the country to showcase their skills.

“At present, we are examining the Dilli Haat model. A team of the civic body would soon get in touch with the Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation (DTTDC) which manages the facility there. We would also visit Dilli Haat as and when Kalagram nears completion. Intricate details of the space would be studied and replicated here,” the senior official added.

Another PMC official pointed out that the stalls at the facility would be given out on a rotational basis to interested parties. “The rotational allotment of stalls would ensure that the visitors have different options every time. We also plan to advertise the facility on a big scale with the help of concerned departments of the state government,” the official added.

“I just hope that the civic body does not delay the project anymore. Pune is called the cultural capital of state, and everyone here would like to have such a facility within close proximity,” Kedar Shikre, a senior citizen from Kothrud, said.

The demonstration condemned the Delhi violence, the provocative hate speech by BJP leader Kapil Mishra and the inaction by the state and police in abetting the mob. The protesters across Europe chose white rose against the fascist forces and send out a message of peace. Some cities chose to protest silently with posters and placards whereas others like Geneva, Krakow protested by reciting poems, singing songs and reading out the Preamble. Human rights activists and journalists of Europe also took part in the demonstration.

Deep Roy, Phd student of Hydraulic Engineering at University of Pisa, said, “The riots in Delhi are clear example of how far the divisive rhetoric practised by the saffron brigade has poisoned the society. I am shocked at the sheer scale of devastation and loss of human life. We strongly condemn the purposeful inaction by the home ministry to curb the situation.”

A research scholar in Geneva said, “The video footages of places of worship, especially mosque, shops, homes being vandalized, burnt and razed to the ground are disturbing. The reports of journalists recounting their horror was hard to believe as something of this magnitude can happen in a democratic, secular country. The protest is also an integrated attempt to bring the issue to the attention of EU leaders, members.”

About 70 individuals, students from India studying in Europe as well as residents of Europe, have written an open letter to the Government of India raising concerns on the current state of lawlessness and lack of personal liberty prevailing in India and demanded immediate withdrawal of CAA and pan-India NRC to protect the secular and humanitarian ethos of Constitution. Ida Venditti, a political science student at University of Pisa, said: “Indian Constitution is at risk and so is civil society. The act is discriminatory as is being used as a weapon against its own people.”

280,['2/03/2020'],Pune: Brakes on plan to turn old buses into mobile toilets,"One of the remodelled PMPML buses refashioned into a mobile toilet

PUNE: The civic body’s mobile toilets, fashioned out of the scrapped PMPML buses, have lost the momentum.

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), in association with the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML), had planned to convert old buses into public toilets in 2016 in an attempt to provide sanitation facilities to residents and tourists, in turn facilitating the reuse of these old vehicles.

The civic body started off with a plan to fashion 100 scrapped buses into mobile toilets. But it remodelled only 10 though funds for another 13 were approved.

The number of toilets for women was to be increased through this initiative. But after remodelling a few buses, the authorities have planned to revert to the old practice of scrapping the old vehicles.

Over 200 old buses will be scrapped instead of converting them into toilets, thus, bringing the project to a standstill.

The PMPML’s guidelines state that a bus is to be scrapped once it completes 7 lakh km and/or has been in service for 10 years.

Nayana Gunde, PMPML’s chairman and managing director, said the public transport body was meeting the demand of the civic administration.

“The PMC has demanded some buses for this project. We have considered it. Further progress will be made soon,” she said.

According to the plan, the buses were to be equipped with five toilet seats — three pertaining to the Indian style and two to the western.

The mobile toilets were also expected to have a shower area fitted with water sensors and a sanitary napkin dispensing machine.

Safety measures such as the provision for a panic button was to be integrated in each facility.

The PMC had stationed these toilets at Jangli Maharaj Road, Shivajinagar, Aundh, Vishrantwadi, Anandnagar, Shaniwarwada, Phulenagar and Baner.

The remodelling cost for each bus was around Rs1.92 lakh. The transport utility has in the past two years scrapped 300 old buses.

Pune: A non-governmental organisation (NGO) has initiated a mass sterilization drive for cats in the city, under which 5 ,000 animals have already been spayed to control their population.

Representatives of the NGO, Karma Foundation, said nine housing societies had already got in touch with them to sterilize free-roaming cats. “There is a lot of awareness about sterilization of dogs, but not much about cats. This prompted us to take up the mass sterilization drive for cats. Housing societies are getting in touch with us to spay their free-roaming or community cats. The best part is that the societies always want their stray cats back after neutering,” Priya Kailad, president, Karma Foundation, told TOI.

Under the drive, the neutered cats are set free after post-surgery care at the location from where they are picked and one of their ears is notched (an indication that the animal has been spayed).

The NGO said dogs were much easier to handle as they were more trusting of humans. “Cats, by nature as well as biologically, are quite sensitive and introvert. So, they have to be dealt with differently than dogs,” she said.

The NGO representatives first carry out a recce of the societies seeking sterilization of the stray cats, following which trap cages are put at suitable spots. “The traps are then covered with a cloth to avoid stressing the animal after entering the cage. Once the cats are trapped, the cages are transported to our centre, where the sterilization is done,” Kailad said.

Once the cats are at the sterilization centre, their caretakers can check for their online updates on the NGO website.

The NGO is also holding a monthly drive where a few representatives visit the slums to educate the residents about spaying cats and why it is necessary. Once the slum residents agree for spaying the community cats, the NGO seeks out sponsors or donors to fund the surgeries, while 50% of the amount is borne by the NGO.

Ganesh Rao, treasurer of Sylvan Heights in Aundh, one of the socities which approached the NGO for sterilizing community cats, said, “We started getting complaints about some undesirable behaviours like cat calls in the night, among others. We then got in touch with Karma Foundation for spaying the cats. After sterilization, all such behaviours have stopped.”

NEW DELHI: These were a trying five days for Sunita Singh as she frantically searched for her missing husband, Prem. Having visited several hospitals, her search sadly ended at the mortuary of Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital. Clothes brought for Singh from “mangal bazaar” (weekly market) in Brijpuri helped Sunita identify her husband from among the six other bodies.

Sunita, who is now seven months pregnant, was inconsolable as she held her three-year-old son. She has two other children, one nine and another five, whom she had left at her home in Gali No. 3, C block, Brijpuri. On Tuesday morning, Singh, a rickshaw puller, had stepped out to get milk. He never returned. “I told him not to go outside, but he did not listen. He said he should get the milk,” said Sunita, who along with her neighbour, Nisha Sharma, had registered a missing complaint at Welcome PS.

For Nasima, too, the search for her son, Aqil Ahmed, ended at the mortuary. Ahmed had gone missing from his house in Mustafabad on February 26. Ahmed’s wife and four children had gone to Loni when the incident took place. Ahmed used to work at a car wash.

At the mortuary, there are still three bodies yet to be identified. A youth, who has been coming to the mortuary since Wednesday in hope of finding his brother, has already looked at 20-odd corpses.

NAGPUR: Health department of state, district administration and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) have launched mass drug administration (MDA) activity to eliminate lymphatic filariasis on Sunday.

For next 20 days, over 22,900 health department employees will visit every household in six districts of Nagpur division and administer the dose of three medicines to all healthy citizens above 2 years of age. The medicines will prevent spread of filariasis, a parasitic disease caused by infection spread through mosquitoes. It will also keep citizens safe from worms and many types of parasite infestations.

“Filariasis is the second most common vector-borne parasitic disease after malaria. Nagpur division still has major prevalence of filariasis,” said deputy director (health) Dr Sanjay Jaiswal. Chandrapur district in Nagpur division has more than 16,000 patients of filariasis, which is the highest in state.

“Triple therapy is the best remedy to eradicate filariasis. In 2019, this drive was conducted in Nagpur district as a pilot project. A remarkable decrease in new cases of filariasis was recorded in the district,” said Dr Milind Ganvir, assistant director of health services.

This year, the government has given identity cards to all employees trained for the drive. They will convince the citizens and also ensure the tablets are consumed in front of them. The staffers will mark left index finger of a person who has taken the dose.

District malaria officer Dr Rahul Gaikwad said target is to cover 100% eligible population. “Children below 2 years, pregnant women and critically ill patients are to be excluded from this drive. All others should consume the tablets when health department personnel visit,” he said. The drive was formally launched in city at Gandhibagh Garden where mayor Sandip Joshi, MLA Krishna Khopde and others were present.

290,['2/03/2020'],Groundwater overuse is major concern: Chief secy,"Jaipur: The groundwater situation in the state is very precarious with an exploitation rate of 140%, said chief secretary D B Gupta while addressing Times Water Summit 2020 here on Saturday.

“Water scenario in Rajasthan is the most challenging in the country with per capita availability of water less than 800 cubic meters against the national average of 1,545 cubic metres, said Gupta.

Lauding the summit as an excellent effort to address the water problem, he said it is more important as the state with 10.4% population of the country had to manage with just 1.16% of surface water and 1.72 % of groundwater.

Speaking about the challenges he said, “Not only the rainfall is scanty, but widely varies from 100 mm in arid west to 900 mm in south east. High intensity of rains and improper water conservation system leading to large percentage of the water going waste resulting in depletion of water table and cultivable land deprived of cultivation.”

In the absence of perennial water sources, 90% agriculture depends on rainwater with recurring famine. “Since people here are heavily depended on agriculture and animal husbandry, water and poverty are closely interlinked, and now climate change posed new challenges,” he said.

He expressed concern over the over expiation of groundwater. He said since water resources are very unevenly distributed, 65% irrigation depended on groundwater rest on surface water. So safe handling, conservation and focus judicious use from available water resources is very extremely important.

As per survey in 2017 out of the 295 blocks, 185 were under over exploited, 33 critical and 29 semi critical. The state experiences drought at regular interval. Out of 73 years post-Independence, 60 years were marked by drought. Increasing demand for water due to population growth and unsustainable water use are the main cause of water problem.

He said about 86% of total water is used for irrigation. So major saving will have had to come from irrigation. Flood irrigation was the norm and, in many areas, still the practice prevails, and it had to be replaced with drip and sprinkler irrigation, Gupta said.

He said quality of water is another issue. Water in large areas are affected by chloride, fluoride, nitrate etc. which aggravates the potable water problem. Over 3,300 aero plants were set up to address this issue.

Presently, the state suffers from imbalance in demand and supply, depleting groundwater, deteriorating quality of water over application of water in irrigation, low irrigation efficacy due to differed maintenance.

Fourteen food carts selling everything from ros omlette and Chinese food in the paved area near Don Bosco School continue to be in CCP’s custody since January after they were found dumping food waste directly into the drains.

In addition to this, over 23 food carts operating in Miramar were also seized by CCP in February.

“The corporation will take a decision in the matter on Monday,” Panaji mayor Uday Madkaikar told TOI.

The food carts were seized because they were found to be operating till 4am despite only having permission to function between 4pm and 10pm, he said, adding that some were not following FDA’s hygiene standards, and not using gloves, aprons and caps, as well as failing to install ‘No Smoking’ signboards.

The ordinary meeting of the corporation will also see discussions on bringing more roads in the state capital under the pay parking system. Currently two and four-wheelers on notified stretches are being charged pay-parking fees.

In addition to this, the handing over of the EDC complex/Patto Plaza to CCP, where the corporation will be entirely responsible for maintenance of roads, footpaths, streetlights and pay-parking in the complex. EDC’s pay-parking contract ends on March 31.

Currently CCP only collects garbage from Patto Plaza while EDC manages the entire complex.

PALAKKAD: The Union minister of state for external affairs and parliamentary affairs, V Muraleedharan , has said the Centre will provide full support for making the Kochi-Coimbatore industrial corridor a reality.

In his address to members of Kanjikode industries forum here on Saturday, the minister said more industries should be set up in the corridor to create jobs opportunities.

“The Narendra Modi government at the Centre has put an end to the ‘licence and permit raj’ and has provided wider opportunities in the form of ease of doing business, startups, Make in India schemes, etc. It has even simplified the income tax payments by making it online thereby putting an end to interference of income tax department. An act on this would soon be introduced,” he said.

“The Centre will also address problems faced by the central public sector companies like Instrumentation Limited (IL) and the Indian Telephone Industries (ITI). It had taken steps to hand over the Palakkad unit of IL to the state government. But there are some delays due to the payment of the value of the land by the state government to the Centre. This could be solved through discussions,” the minister said.

He also invited entrepreneurs to utilize the possibilities of their investing in African counties for which the central government had introduced many programmes. He also said the demand for setting up an ESI and PF office in Palakkad will be taken up with the concerned central departments.

The minister who was on a whirlwind tour of the district on Saturday attended half-a-dozen programmes in different parts and inaugurated six major projects of Palakkad municipality implemented under the ‘Amrut smart city project’ at a function in the municipal office here.

He also has laid the foundation stone for Kalmandapam bus stand and four foot-over-bridges. The minister inaugurated solar plants in three schools, Palakkad Eye CCTV cameras in the municipality and the primary health centre in Koppam.

JAIPUR: Necessity is the mother of innovations, a secret behind the desert state ’s pioneering models for water conservation that it gave to the country in the past. But can Rajasthan do it one more time when the situation demands the most? Renowned experts and senior government officials during a panel discussion on ‘Making Rajasthan Water Positive’ did hold out hope that the critical situation can be turned around but it needs a circular approach of community participation, technology adoption and government policy intervention.

Opening the conversation, Naveen Mahajan , secretary, water resources department, set the context by saying Rajasthan depends heavily on neighboring states like Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat as it gets 52% of its surface water from them though rivers like Ravi, Beas & Satluj, Chambal and Narmada. But Mahajan raised the red flag as to what will happen if those states violate the inter-state water sharing agreements in case of scarcity.

“Water being a very political topic, no state is willing to cede its share to the neighboring state. Unfortunately, we are downstream state, at the tail-end. If there is water scarcity in the upstream states, things will be very tough. The major challenge of water security for us is to ensure that our supplies are guaranteed as per the agreements,” said Mahajan.

He listed out the priorities of the government and said it’s high time we went for drips sprinklers. “Whatever new projects will come, now they will be purely on pressure pipe micro irrigation system,” added Mahajan.

Ajitabh Sharma, principal secretary, energy department, who also served as secretary of water resources department in the past, said it would be difficult to achieve sustainability by following a linear approach.

“Technology, engineering, projects, implementation, and bringing in large capital will not lead to sustainability if the community is not involved. Water is not scarce, there is plenty of it. It all depends how you use it. We have to start thinking beyond the engineering prospective. So, it has be a circular economy. We have to treat the water, have treatment standards for different uses which is not there now. In India, we have not started thinking about nature-based solutions for treatment of water, and we have to understand the aquifers for their recharge,” said Sharma.

But answering directly the question of making Rajasthan water positive, director of Central Ground Water Board S K Jain said Rajasthan has ground water which can be replenished up to 12 bcm (billion cubic metre) but we withdraw 17 bcm annually.

“To make it water positive, we need 5 bcm more. Storage of water, creating recharge structures, targeting Chambal basins, recycling and using less water and managing the water used in the agriculture sector will be the key to meet the shortfall and make Rajasthan water positive, Jain added.

Environmentalist and director general of Centre for Science and Environment Sunita Narain dwelt on the immediate dangers of climate change and the urgency to take sustainability seriously.

“We will have to catch up very fast because with climate change you have no time now to waste. Climate change is going to mean that we will have more rain in fewer number of rainy days and India already gets rain only for 100 hours on an average. Now, because of climate change the hours will come down and the rains will increase. This means we will have floods and droughts and it will not be like the traditional droughts or floods. It will be devastating,” warned Narain.

Agreeing with the remarks made by Jain, Ashok Sethi, chairman of Tata Consulting Engineers , said to avoid a situation like Punjab, we need to have better planning to avoid severe water crisis. “It is not the job of just agriculture department or water resource department to think about conserving water. We need to think about water as a model of economic growth, and take this issue seriously,” said Sethi.

Director of NJS Engineering India Pvt Ltd Sanjay Guleria said there have been ancient techniques through which we conserve water but to recycle it we need public participation. “It is not the work of just the government alone but people have to come forward to participate in it. They are still hesitant to use the recycled water and for that, more awareness needs to be created,” said Guleria.

H. Balasubramaniam, managing director, Xylem Water Solutions India Pvt Ltd, who gave a presentation on water crisis and management earlier in the summit said Rajasthan has been able to improve its parameters but needs to take more steps to make it sustainable. Balasubramaniam said, “Rather than building new projects, we have to take maximum advantage of the existing ones. The second thing we tell the state governments is that they do not go for immediate high capex projects. On the other hand, I think the problem of water needs to be taken to the roots. Can the government make a policy and enforce it strictly to ensure that a hotel, for an example, recycles the water it uses so that it does not load the burden on the public.”

296,['2/03/2020'],RTE deadline extended to March 4,"Nagpur: The state education department has extended the deadline for online applications for free RTE quota seats in schools to March 4. Though 400% more applications have already come in for RTE seats, the education department feels more people should get a chance to apply.

As per data released by the education department, just over 30,000 applications have been submitted for 6,797 seats. TOI had reported last week that applications have crossed the 300% mark and within a few days, it has breached the 400% mark as well. With applications coming in steadily, it’s no surprise that the officials don’t want to shut down the online application portal yet.

Education activist Shahid Sharif too campaigned for extension of date. “There are many parents who complain about slow server speed, website crashing and applications not going through. It’s only fair that the department permits an extension of the application deadline,” said Sharif.

As the application numbers increase drastically, the other concern is of many schools boycotting RTE admissions. Independent English Schools Association has declared that over 20,000 seats may not be available for RTE lottery candidates because of their boycott till government pays pending dues.

Ajay Singh Ugras:

Spotting tigers at Ranthambore Tiger Reserve is common. Most visitors go home with loads of photographs of the majestic animal. But experts warn that this lucky feeling could be short-lived. With 30 tigers going missing from the reserve in the last decade, it may not be too long before RTR loses its sighting friendly tag unless urgent steps are taken, reportandAs the vehicle manoeuvred through the mud tracks in sun and shade, it’s first the sudden bark of the sambhar as monkeys scurry up the trees. Soon, the gold and black haze through the bush comes clear as the tiger steps out. It’s what dreams are made up of and the Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (RTR) has over the years gained 'notoriety' of fulfilling them.And that is the draw for thousands of tourists as they pour in from across the globe to the reserve. “I have been to Kanha Tiger Reserve , Bostwana in South Africa and many other parks across the globe. But the sightings in Ranthambore are the best. It’s a dry, deciduous forest that makes sightings easier. Besides, sighting a tiger in the wilderness is a class apart from seeing a lion or any other animal,” says an excited Mustafa Alam Khan, a tourist from Hyderabad, who chanced upon two tigers in his morning safari.He is not alone. The scores of smiling faces as vehicles escort tourists out of the RTR after a safari speak on their date with the tiger. But the smiles, warn experts, may be short lived. With an alarming 30 tigers missing from the RTR in the last decade, it may not be too long before the reserve loses its sighting friendly tag to some other park unless immediate steps are taken.Since 2009, the park has mysteriously lost 30 tigers including seven old and 23 young ones. Among the 23 are 11 females which do not usually venture out for creating a territory, like the males. Out of this, while most number of tigers, nine went missing between 2014 and 2017. It was followed by two periods — 2006-2010 and 2013-2014 -- when five tigers each went missing. Even in the past two years, data reveals, five tigers went missing. They are T-9, T-20, T-77, T-78 and T23.This data, however, does not include 22 other tigers that died natural deaths and their bodies were traced. These tigers were either killed in territorial fights or due to human intervention or were poisoned by villagers.There are even some, where the cause of death still remains a mystery. Ranthambore also had 18 other tigers that were either shifted to Sariska and Mukundra reserves or had migrated to other forests outside the state or had been put into captivity due to “abnormal” behaviour.“A careful analysis of the data on missing tigers reveals that over the years, the reserve has developed two black holes in the north-east and south- east areas of the park adjoining Sawai Man Singh sanctuary. Most of the tigers that went missing were last sighted in these areas,” says conservation biologist Dharmendra Khandal of Tiger Watch.One of the black holes identified is in the region between Sawnta and Kila Khandar with its centre at Banpur. The other is the Kanduli, Kharda Ka Nallah and Bhairupura region. In the first black hole, 11 tigers have gone missing after being sighted, while the second black hole has seen eight tiger missing. The two areas amount to 60% of the total tigers that have gone missing from the park.Both these areas are natural outlets from the reserve but are adjoining 13 villages. The land here is fertile and there is plenty of water because of which extensive farming happens in these regions.“Villagers electrify their fences to ward off animals, but are often themselves a victim to electrocution. On December 26, 2018 the body of one Badri Sharma was found in one of the farms. Another person identified as Raju Gujjar too died of electrocution in the winter of 2017 near Khandar region. That tigers are also killed in these areas became amply evident when bodies of T-45 and T-46 were found in Khandar. Both deaths were due to revenge killing. Bombs used as baits for animals also been recovered from these areas as was a snared leopard once,” added Khandal.Officials conceded that big cats venturing out of the park through nullahs are a menace. “These natural nullah open towards the Chambal area which is surrounded by villages. The farm lands are owned by villagers and tigers are at risk if they venture outside. We have also deployed additional guards at the post, but cannot restrict the animal walking out through natural path,” said Ranthambore DFO Mukesh Saini.“However, we would soon constitute a committee to ascertain the exact number of missing tigers from the park,” he added.Non-reporting of many deaths are also a reason for missing tigers. “Often villagers lay traps and tigers get killed. The body is then quietly buried as they do not want to get into trouble. Sometimes, it is also a case of migration to other states with officials not following it up,” he said.Despite the growing vulnerability of tigers at the park in the recent years, there is little for an already over-worked forest department. “Not only are we under-staffed in terms of manpower, but remain engrossed in catering to VIP tourists’ safaris throughout the year. Most of our seven jeeps and our staff have to be deployed for VIP duty as requests pour in from the high and mighty. Special forces like the STPF, which was to be developed, have remained a piped dream,” explained forest officials.",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74433428,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-285857,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/roar-of-ranthambore-may-fall-silent-if-we-dont-act/articleshow/74431698.cms

299,['2/03/2020'],Schools may get water-testing unit soon,"Kozhikode: All high schools and higher secondary schools in the district with chemistry labs are likely to get a water quality testing facility soon. The district development committee has decided to submit a proposal for the setting up of water testing labs in schools aiming to ensure service to the residents of the locality.

At present drinking water testing facility is available at Regional Analytical Lab at Malaparamba and at the Centre for Water Resources Development and Management (CWRDM). Not many persons are making use of the water testing facilities owing to various reasons. “Many schools in the district have high-end laboratories which are now only used for academic purpose,” said district panchayat president Babu Parassery, who is also the chairman of the district development committee. Once water testing facility is arranged at the school labs it would be of great help to the residents, including the families of the students, he said. The proposal for setting up water quality testing facility was mooted in the backdrop of increased pollution of water resources including wells. Many wells in the district are polluted with coliform and e-coli bacteria.

Besides, the presence of excessive quantity of iron and other minerals are also not good for health. The water quality testing facility will help the residents to test the quality of their well water and take necessary steps to purify the water.

Many offices, shops and schools are depending on drinking water supplied by private parties. The water quality supplied by the private parties also is a cause of concern as the examination by food safety department has been finding the presence of bacteria in bottled and canned water. The lack of knowledge regarding the source of water is also a concern.

The residents will be able to easily access the water quality testing facility if the facility is introduced in schools, said the Parassery. Students will also be able to learn the issues related to water pollution and the importance for maintaining the hygiene of water resources, he added.

The plan is to set up the water testing facility at the earliest utilizing the asset development fund of MLAs of all assemblies. Government and aided schools with Chemistry lab will be selected for the implementation of the project.

301,['2/03/2020'],MVA government set to bring back Nagpur Improvement Trust for unauthorized areas,"Representative image

NAGPUR: Despite opposition from BJP, Congress and BSP corporators, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of Shiv Sena , Congress and NCP is set to reinstate the Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) as planning authority for unauthorized areas of the city.

It is likely that NIT won’t get back status of planning authority of its earlier seven improvement schemes and regularized layouts handed over to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC).

Guardian minister Nitin Raut, who took the initiative to bring back NIT, told TOI, “I am firm on giving planning authority status to NIT. At the most, seven schemes earlier under NIT may not become its part,” he said.

Assembly speaker Nana Patolesaid, “Complaints from people have increased manifold ever since NMC became the sole planning authority for city. On Friday, I directed the NMC officials to expedite works it took over from NIT. Government should take decision soon,” he said.

Congress city president and West Nagpur MLA Vikas Thakre, who was present in the meeting, too demanded planning authority status for NIT. “Even after becoming authority for entire city in August last year, NMC has failed to dispose off even a single Gunthewari case. NIT has experience of 19 years regarding regularization and development of unauthorized areas. The previous BJP government did not dissolve NIT totally and now its staff is sitting idle,” he said.

BJP-Sena government under Devendra Fadnavis had decided to dissolve NIT on August 13 last year. On August 27, 2019, NMC was made sole planning authority for city. But the government failed to hand over properties, funds and liabilities of NIT to the NMC.

Over 1 lakh files of unauthorized layouts and plots are still with NIT. The NMC has failed to even open a separate cell for Gunthewari areas.

On January 2, Raut had written to CM Uddhav Thackeray stressing the need to bring back NIT. Raut stated that NMC neither has expertise nor experienced officials and employees to take care of Gunthewari areas.

Responding to Raut’s plan, urban development department wrote to municipal commissioner and NIT chairman on January 10 to submit their opinion. NIT said it would abide with whatever decision the government takes.

NMC general body on February 13 passed a resolution to keep NMC as sole planning authority. All BJP, BSP and Congress corporators present in the house were in favour of the resolution. NCP corporator Duneshwar Pethe, who was not present at the general body meeting, told TOI that NIT should be brought back as NMC is a non-performer.

Sena’s two corporators Kishor Kumeriya and Mangala Gavare were also not present at the GB. But Kumeriya, Sena leader in NMC, had many a time demanded NIT’s dissolution.

The state had submitted around 12 projects to be undertaken under ICZMP at a total cost of over Rs 200 crore.Funding for the projects would be shared between the World Bank (50%), central government (30%) as grants, and the state government (20%), a senior government officer said.

The officer said the Centre has approved the funds based on the preliminary project report prepared by the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM), Chennai.

The officer said that the detailed project report (DPR) has been prepared by NCSCM in three projects, including marine biodiversity of critical habitats of Goa, status, threats, conservation measures and management plan; establishing and designating coastal sand dune parks in Goa, and erosion/accretion assessment studies to ascertain feasibility of annual replenishment of sand along the estuarine stretches of the state.

Once the reports for all six projects are prepared, it would be submitted to the World Bank for approval , the officer said.

During the study, NCSCM will identify problems faced and propose solutions, and based on this, the projects would be taken up in the state.

Under the first phase, Gujarat and Odisha was taken up and the rest of the states are being taken up under the second phase under which Goa is selected.

TOI was the first to report that Goa could lose Rs 400 crore for coastal development under the ICZMP as the government failed to submit a detailed project report to the environment ministry. Based on the TOI report, then CM Manohar Parrikar directed officials to go ahead with the projects.

Nagpur: Economic Explosives Limited (EEL), a company under city’s Solar Group, a major producer of commercial and defence explosives, expects to put up its latest electronic multimodal hand grenade for trials soon. This is one step ahead of the latest grenade being acquired by the Army.

The technology for making the grenade has been shared with the company by Chandigarh-based Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory (TBRL), a unit under DRDO, a senior official of EEL told TOI.

Based on it, EEL has come up with initial units of the grenade, that were also put up on display at Axis-2020 exhibition under way at VNIT.

TBRL has also shared the technology of the non-electronic multimodal grenades with EEL, making it the sole private player to take part in the process for supplying the weapon to the army.

EEL has already taken part in a request for proposal (RFP) by the Army to make multimodal grenades without using the electronic mechanism. The weapon will also be made by the Ordnance Factory, Khamaria in Madhya Pradesh. Both the entities await the bulk production order from the Army.

In the meantime, EEL said it has also developed electronic grenade — mechatronic — which also has a multimodal function. The mechatronic was on display at Axis 2020.

A senior official from the company told TOI that the company has finished internal trials of the electronic grenades and soon user trials, which is an evaluation by the Army, will take place. The electronic device will ensure the perfect timing for explosion in the grenade.

Maintaining the timing for explosion, once the pin is removed, is a crucial requirement for a grenade’s functioning. As per the Army’s requirements, it has to be not before 3.5 seconds and not later than 4.5 seconds.

In the grenades made so far, the process is chemically controlled. “With the electronic chip fitted, precise timing can be maintained,” said the company’s official.

309,['2/03/2020'],BMC gets cracking on retailers stocking single-use plastic bags,"The civic body fined 11 hawkers and shopkeepers Rs 5,000 each

MUMBAI: A day after the BMC announced the revival of the ban on single-use plastic , its men collected Rs 55,000 in fines from 11 shopkeepers and hawkers.

The action came after state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray announced on Friday that he aims to make Maharashtra free of single-use plastic by May 1. He was replying to supplementaries during question hour in the legislative council.

Over the weekend, civic officials conducted awareness drives in high footfall areas like markets and zones outside railway stations. Using mega phones, they announced that a hefty penalty would be slapped on those found using single-use plastic.

On Saturday, 11 errant hawkers and shopkeepers in Andheri, Goregaon, Borivli and Colaba were fined Rs 5,000 each. Civic officials said they plan to first act against hawkers and commercial establishments, and will act against citizens at a later stage.

“From Monday, we will intensify our drive. Civic inspectors too will have to give an undertaking that no plastic is being provided in areas assigned to them,” said a civic official from the shop and establishments department. “We will also warn establishments and hawkers that in case of repeat offence, we will not only hike the penalty amount, but also consider cancelling their licence.”

But Dayashankar Singh of the Azad Hawkers ’ Union complained that any action by the municipality always starts with hawkers. “But hawkers do not get plastic bags from their home. Instead of targeting them, the authorities should first crackdown on the single-use plastic manufacturing units,” he said.

The BMC had started its drive against single-use plastic in June 2018, and till date has seized 86,000kg material and recovered Rs 4.6 crore as fines after examining around 16 lakh premises.

But the BMC was unable to sustain the momentum. While some civic officials claimed that vigilance reduced last year with staffers going on poll duty, others admitted that the drive slowed down due to lack of clarity, non-availability of alternatives and inadequate awareness campaigns. A civic official had earlier told TOI: “Extended producer responsibility (EPR) is a matter of concern. It was decided that plastic water bottle manufactures would develop a mechanism to collect used plastic bottles for recycling, but it has not happened.”

To fix the problem, the BMC has now decided to create awareness at its schools, asking students to collect plastic at home and deposit it at school for recycling. Most BMC schoolchildren come from slums. BMC will then encourage private schools to adopt similar measures.

310,['2/03/2020'],Rajasthan CM to PM: Fulfil national tag vow of canal project,"Ashok Gehlot

JAIPUR: The desert state, where water does not lose its scarcity warning tag even in normal monsoon years, has endured droughts 60 times in the past 72 years.

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot made the reference to the harsh reality at the ‘Times Water Summit 2020’ on Saturday to drive home the importance of the proposed Rs 37,500-crore Eastern Rajasthan Canal Project (ERCP).

“The Prime Minister had come twice to the state before the elections and said he would declare ERCP as a project of national importance. We want him to keep his promise,” Gehlot said while dwelling on how the cost of delivery goes up in Rajasthan due to dispersed human habitations on one hand and limited financial resources to provide water to every segment of society on the other.

Senior state government officials at the event said they were still waiting for approval of the detailed project report that has been submitted to the Centre. ERCP is designed to bring surplus water in southern Rajasthan rivers to deficit basins in south-eastern areas of the state which will meet drinking, irrigation and industrial water needs of 13 districts.

Gehlot, who as chief minister 20 years ago, drove the popular social campaign “Pani Bachao, Bijli Bachao and Sabko Padhao” in villages of the state, said the Centre’s Jal Jeevan Mission is a good initiative, but the funding pattern puts a big burden on the states.

“In Rajasthan, we want to provide piped water to every household. But a 50% contribution to the scheme will require us to spend between Rs 1-1.5 lakh-crore. Earlier, the Centre’s schemes used to be in the ratios of 90:10, 70:30 and 60:40, putting a smaller burden on the states. But now, most of them have been made 50:50 or have been left on the states completely,” added the chief minister.

He said the current economic situation is worrisome, and has put the finances of 17 states in poor condition squeezing the spending for welfare schemes. “In Rajasthan, people have moved from villages to dhanis in their fields, leading to dispersed populations. That’s why the cost of delivery is more in Rajasthan, compared to others states where population is concentrated in villages. Also, it is not that we are getting a heavy rush of large industries that would increase the state’s revenues. The government has to do financial planning as we depend on debt for these initiatives and it is unfortunate,” explained Gehlot.

Speaking on the ‘Times Water Summit 2020,’ powered by Knowledge Partner Xylem, Gehlot said the water scarcity in the desert state forced people to innovative conservation methods like wells, tankas, baoris and ponds, but now it needs new ideas to provide its people fluoride- and nitrate-free drinking water.

“The state will benefit from the new ideas generated from the Summit where experts deliberated on number of issues related to water,” said the chief minister.

311,['2/03/2020'],Uddhav’s wife Rashmi takes over as Sena daily’s editor,"Mumbai: Rashmi Thackeray , considered to be one of the driving forces behind husband Uddhav and son Aaditya ’s plunge in electoral politics , seems to have now assumed a more direct role in Shiv Sena ’s affairs. On Sunday, her name appeared in the print line of party mouthpiece Saamana as its editor. Sena MP Sanjay Raut will continue as its executive editor.

Rashmi’s appointment comes as a replacement for Uddhav, who stepped down recently, and has surprised many. The Sena president’s name was dropped from the daily’s print line on November 28, 2019 the day he took oath as Maharashtra CM. This was done to avoid the ‘office of profit’ issue.

A Sena leader, on the condition of anonymity, said Raut as executive editor will continue handling the paper’s day-to-day operations. “Raut used to contribute editorials. Uddhav has given him a free hand to run the paper and he will continue to do so.”

Rashmi, for long known as the Thackeray ‘bahu’, a reference to her being the late Sena founder Bal Thackeray’s daughter in law, has always maintained a distance from politics. She doesn’t issue political statements and normally avoids the dais in party functions. A rare occasion when she was seen on the dais was alongside Aaditya, when she announced that her son would contest the assembly polls from Worli.

Minister for tourism and environment Aaditya, talking to journalists in Pune, applauded Rashmi, who is known as 'Vahini' in Sena circles, on her new role, saying he is happy for his mother and will cooperate with her in her new innings.

Bal Thackeray's name has been retained as Saamana’s founding editor on the daily’s masthead. Since its launch on January 23, 1989, Saamana has been vocal in articulating the party’s political and social stand. It was critical of government policies in the state and at the Center, and also pointed fingers at Prime Minister Narendra Modi even while the Sena was in the 2014-2019 BJP-led alliance that governed Maharashtra. One of the reasons given by former CM Devendra Fadnavis (who is now leader of the opposition in the legislative assembly) for strained relations between the Sena and the BJP was continuous criticism by Saamana of the BJP’s top leadership.

The day Uddhav took oath as CM, Saamana carried a special editorial on its front page, taunting the party's critics. It mentioned that the true religion of Maharashtra was one that was comprehensive, and the kingdom established by Chhatrapati Shivaji was based on these principles. It wrote that Uddhav's government would follow the great Maratha ruler’s tenets.

However, later she gathered courage and along with her family members reached the police station on Saturday evening to lodge a case against the accused. The accused is absconding and search is on for him.

The rape survivor in her report said that the accused was familiar with her family. She said that he reached her home on Thursday noon when she was alone. The accused first inquired about her brother and then finding him away from home, he raped her.

Police have initiated an investigation into the matter. The medical examination of the victim was conducted on Sunday. On delay in lodging the report, the SHO said the survivor first avoided narrating her plight to the family members. It was only later that she told them following which a complaint was lodged.

313,['2/03/2020'],Lucknow University faces tough test ahead as salaries exceed revenue,"TimesView Lucknow University (LU) has been reeling under a financial crisis for over two decades after the government froze its grants at the 1998 level. Though the grants were increased marginally in 2009, it was not sufficient to meet the expenses required to maintain the quality of education. In the centenary year, government can give LU a heritage university status and increase its grant or allocate special funds. The university also needs to make efforts and raise funds from its alumni the way IIMs, IITs and other central universities have done.

LUCKNOW: It will be a tough test for Lucknow University to scrape its finances to pay salaries to its employees while reeling under a deficit of over Rs 100 crore in its annual budget for 2020-21. The financial state of university is precarious as its total revenue is less than the salary it pays.As per the budget approved by finance committee on Saturday, LU’s estimated revenue is Rs 137 crore, far short of Rs 250 crore expenditure.LU’s expected revenue receipts of Rs 137 crore include Rs 50 crore as self-finance course fees, Rs 44 crore as grant from state government and Rs 43 crore as examination fees from 170 associated colleges.In comparison, expenditure is pegged at Rs 250 crore, including a whopping Rs 190 crore being salary expense alone. The state government gives only Rs 44 crore to the university for paying salaries.In last budget, the salary expense was Rs 143 crore and the deficit Rs 32 crore. The gap was met through transfer of surplus from self-finance courses, bank overdrafts, enchashment of fixed deposits and funds generated by conducting UP BEd Entrance Examination given to it by government.Officials said, the salary expenditure will increase in 2020-21 because of payment of bonus, increments and perks accumulated under the seventh pay commission.“New appointments and development can be deferred but not salaries. We will request government to bear salary expenses. Rest, we will manage through new revenue sources,” said vice-chancellor Prof Alok Kumar Rai.LU’s cash crunch started two decades ago when state government froze salary grant at 1998 level (Rs 16 crore). The increase in salary expenses in the following years were met by starting new self-finance courses and granting affiliation to self-finance colleges.The government increased the grant to Rs 44 crore, but expenses increased by five times in two decades.",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74434640,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-982682,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lu-faces-tough-test-ahead-as-salaries-exceed-revenue/articleshow/74431703.cms

315,['2/03/2020'],Usgao locals want nullah restored,"Ponda: Alleging that the contractor has destroyed the Dhaushirem-Khandepar nullah at Dhatwada-Usgao, locals demanded immediate restoration of the stretch.

Following opposition to work of laying a pipeline at Dhatwada-Usgao, the superintending engineer of water resources department Pramod Badami had recently inspected the site and tried to reason with villagers.

Residents had gathered at Dhatwada on Saturday as the contractor was supposed to resume work that has been halted since February 1.

The water resources department (WRD) is laying a 1,000mm pipeline to facilitate augmentation of the Mhadei water from the Ganjem water scheme to rejuvenate the Khandepar river.

Every summer, the Khandepar river level dips, forcing WRD to source water from elsewhere to rejuvenate it. Until last summer, water from Ganjem was being poured directly into the Dhaushirem nullah, from where it would flow into the river.

As the entire quantity of water does not reach the river a direct pipeline is being laid from Dhaushirem to Khandepar. However, locals have been opposing it over the possibility that underground water resources could be destroyed.

On Saturday, Satyawati Gaude, a local demanded that the nullah be restored immediately. Another local, Vaibhavi Gaude, alleged that the contractor only give assurances, but doesn't keep his word. She said the nullah is important to locals as they fetch water from it during summer but the contractor has filled the nullah basin with mud.

316,['2/03/2020'],Focus on application based questions on theorems and concepts,"Representative image

For ICSE X mathematics exam it is suggested that students should stick to prescribed syllabus provided by ICSE board and should put all energy in studying without diverting it into some new concepts which wont be asked in the exam. An important thing students should keep in mind while practicing and solving the exam, is creating a formulae sheet and important concepts used chapter wise, which will help them to understand the overall reviews of all chapters.

Generally application based questions on theorems and concepts are asked in the exam, for this practicing problem solving is the key. For proper management of time allotted, students are advised to solve previous years question papers in a stipulated time.

While solving the paper, students should keep a tab on the time allotted. The exam is of two and half hours and is of 80 marks. It consists of two sections of 40-40 marks. Out of which section A is compulsory and in section B students get options, they have to solve 4 out of 7 questions.

The first 15 minutes allotted as the reading time is the most crucial part of exam. In this time students can choose the questions that they find comfortable to solve and which are less time consuming. It is also advised that students should solve the paper in the sequence i.e. starting with section A and terminating with Section B. While solving problems, only the necessary steps should be included in the solution, and also all the rough work should be done below the respective problems only, marks are also given seeing the rough work incase essential steps are not included in actual solution.

Each sub question should be solved in maximum of 5 minutes. In this manner the entire section A should be completed in 1 hour and the rest of 1 hour 15mintues should be utilized in solving the 5 questions from section B, one considered extra for a safer side. With all this time management tricks, students will be left with a spare 15 minutes which can be utilized in checking the answers.

317,['2/03/2020'],North East Delhi Riots: Wedding plans come unstuck for caretaker dedicated to his school,"Roop Singh said even his clothes were borrowed

NEW DELHI: After much struggle, Megha Singh (20) had zeroed in on a lehanga for herself. With weeks to go for her wedding, her father, Roop Singh, used up all his savings to buy jewellery. A caretaker with DRP Convent School in Shiv Vihar — one of the many that were targeted during the violence in northeast Delhi — Singh suddenly finds his life in tatters.

“Our samdhis (to-be in-laws) were insistent on getting everything done before Holi. But I told them that exams would be under way in our school and I would need to be extra vigilant at my job. We would have fixed a date after Holi, but now it has been postponed indefinitely,” Singh said. “Our belongings have been reduced to ashes and all the money and jewellery have gone,” Singh said, his hands covered in soot. Megha is still in shock.

A family of five, Singh — three daughters, husband and wife — used to live on the top floor of the school that has now been charred beyond recognition. The rooms are burnt and the remains of furniture thrown into the compound. “Around 2.45pm on Monday, when tension started to escalate, the school sent the children home. We locked the gates from inside,” he recalled. Megha saw the arsonists climbing down into the compound using ropes from the adjacent building. The lock was broken and, soon after, it was mayhem. “I was eating at that time. Megha came running to us and told us to run,” Singh said. “We jumped from a height of nearly 14 feet. It was a matter of life and death,” he added.

When a semblance of normacly was restored, the family returned to find that nothing of their belongings remained. “My wife, Geeta, and our daughters are now staying at a friend’s place in Govind Vihar. I have nothing now. Even the clothes I am wearing are borrowed,” Singh said. Singh alleged that every time he called the police, he was told that a team was on its way. But nobody came, he said. “The rioters had a free run for two days,” he remarked. “Now, the ladke wale are saying that the wedding can’t take place in such an atmosphere. My daughter saved my life, but there is a question mark on her life now,” Singh rued.

Nobody knows where the country is heading. I can say for certain, I have never seen such a situation,” said Gehlot on Saturday.

The CM alleged, “Everyone in private confides that their business has been hit badly but none has the courage to speak out. An atmosphere of fear is being created through CBI, ED and Income Tax.”

“The government itself creating conditions conducive for civil war are inconceivable and unimaginable. Governments always worry about the opposition instigating violence and take them into confidence to deliver good governance. It was never seen the government adopts a vitriolic campaign to win elections and the results are for everybody to see in Delhi. It is not just the national capital, the country’s image has been tarnished,” he said.

He added that though India is a developing country it had enjoyed tremendous respect among other nations. India had enjoyed the world’s admiration for its constitutional democracy, diversity, religion and languages and regions and above all as the land of Gandhi, while neighbouring Pakistan was plagued by military rule.

Gehlot said the country made tremendous progress in all sectors but still some people asked what had Congress done.

The UP director general of health in a circular to urban local bodies (ULB) in the state instructed them to ensure that no vendor sells tobacco products without procuring a licence issued by them. Besides, ULBs are asked to enforce the vendor licencing system strictly to curb the selling of tobacco by flouting the set rules.

In the circular, director (health) of UP directorate of medical and health services Dr Madhu Saxena stated that nearly 5.3 crore adult people in the state consume tobacco in some or the other form. “Among 5.3 crore, 52% men and 18% of women are suffering from various diseases, including cancer, and they untimely die.”

In the letter issued to all 16 municipal commissioners across the state, including Bareilly Municipal Corporation, she further stated that despite the Centre introduced the Cigarettes & Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) in 2003, in the absence of a licencing system, the Act was not being enforced in letter and spirit in the state.

Meanwhile, BMC health officer Sanjeev Pradhan said they were yet to receive a copy of the order to take further action. “Our teams launch drive time-to-time to ensure tobacco products are not being sold to minors. We will soon issue a notice to all vendors, asking them to procure a licence for selling tobacco products.”

According to BMC sources, close to 5,500 roadside kiosks are selling tobacco products in the city.

BMC officials said vendors caught selling tobacco products without having a licence would be slapped with a penalty of Rs 2,000 for the first time, and if caught again, the penalty amount would be increased to Rs 5,000. Besides, legal action would be initiated, along with the fine of Rs 5,000, against the repeated offenders, added BMC official.

A roadside vendor, Rakesh Kumar, said, “Civic body officials never asked me to obtain a licence, so I am not aware of the decision. But, if I get a notice, I will apply for a licence.”

PANAJI: February this year was the hottest in the past decade, said scientists from the India meteorological department (IMD). The maximum temperature reported at Panaji was above 35°C on eight of the 29 days, this month. This is highest number of such days in the month of February in last 10 years, according to the IMD records.

""The last time the state experienced a February this warm, with more than eight days recording over 35 C, was in 2006,"" said IMD scientist Rahul MC.

IMD has attributed the reason for the high day temperatures to wind direction. According to their observations, after February 10, the surface wind was blowing predominantly from the Eastern side of Goa.

“The surface winds blow from the east-northeast direction for around 6-7 days in February every year, and so, temperatures above 35 degrees would prevail for a few days every February—which is not considered abnormal. This year however, it happened that the easterly wind dominated for more days, bringing with it some heat,” Rahul said.

Maximum day temperatures of above 35 C were recorded on February 11,17,18,21,22,23, 26 and 28. Of these days, the highest temperature recorded was on the 23rd, with the mercury touching 36.6 C, IMD said.

Despite the hot weather right up to February 28, the state experienced rains on February 29 and March 1.

TOI had reported on Sunday that the prevalence of cyclonic circulations in the Arabian sea led to parts of Goa, like Sanguem, experiencing rain on Saturday.

""The cyclonic circulation has shifted North Westward of the coast. On Saturday, the cyclonic circulation was over the South of Maharashtra and on Sunday it moved towards South West Madhya Pradesh . There was another circulation over coastal Karnataka . Due to this combined effect there was an effect of the moisture incursion on Goa on Sunday as well,"" Rahul said.

NAGPUR: While Patanjali Ayurved hopes to restart work on its stalled food processing plant in Nagpur soon, it has also been allotted a pilot project by the union agriculture ministry to carry out soil testing and recommend fertilizer requirement to farmers.

Nagpur is among the three districts where the work will be implemented, Patanjali’s managing director Acharya Balkrishna told TOI. “The districts chosen to take up the project on a pilot basis include Nagpur in Maharashtra, Haridwar in Uttarakhand and Hamirpur Uttar Pradesh,” said Balkrishna.

As this would help in increasing the farm yield, Patanjali may also give a buy back guarantee for some of the crops, he added.

“We have already started collecting data for the soil tests. In Nagpur, data from 3,000 farmers has been collected,” said Balkrishna.

“The project is being supported by the union agriculture ministry but even Patanjali is investing its resources in the project. The objective is to help the government in doubling the income of farmers,” he said.

Balkrishna said the company has made arrangements to fund projects, including the one in Nagpur. Patanjali has taken up 230 acres of land in the non-SEZ portion of Mihan for setting up a food park. Even as machines have been procured, the work for setting up the plant has come to a standstill since more than two months due to a financial crunch.

Along with the FMCG business, Patanjali is also banking on its recently-started IT venture. “The start-up was made operational on a secret note to avoid the glare of rivals,” said Balakrishna.

The company, Bharwua Solutions, already has four patents and has developed a software platform that can replace SAP, he claimed.

“It’s a purely Swadeshi software and can do away with dependence on any foreign technology. We have come up with a software that enables real time tracking of the movement of goods. The traceability software will prevent adulteration of the food products. We have already begun the application of the traceability software in milk, honey and grains like wheat and bajra made by Patanjali,” he said

Balkrishna claimed that the software will not only cut Patanjali’s IT expenditure, but also give it an edge over rivals, enabling real time monitoring of movement of goods.

“The software arm is a different company and apart from catering to the in-house needs of the FMCG business, we are keen to offer our services to other companies in the sector. “Its like being a Ayurvedic practitioner whose services are open for all,” he said.

Like every other stage in his life, Suhas Lalinakere Yathiraj, 36, left the stage of TEDx Lucknow on Sunday evening after he had inspired all and sundry with his saga of adversities and accomplishments.

“My first game in 2016 was against world No. 5. After trailing in the first round, I came back with a bang and became the first unranked para-badminton player to win gold in the Beijing championship,” Suhas told his audience. “The lesson here is that it is not the fall that matters, but how you get up and move ahead,” added the first-ever serving Indian bureaucrat to win gold for India in an international meet.

Usha Vishwakarma, the founder of Lucknow’s Red Brigade that teaches women self defence, took the stage next and made jaws drop with tales of true grit. “In 2006, a co-worker had tried to rape me. Ever since, I have been educating and training girls for such situations of unexpected assault. We have come up with our own technique of self-defence called ‘Nishastra Kala’ (weapon-less skill), which we are spreading far and wide,” Usha said followed by a demo by her team.

Kalyani Saha Chawla, originally from Kolkata and now in Delhi, motivated everyone at TEDx Lucknow to take risks and challenge oneself when opportunities come knocking.

“I am a self-confessed serial entrepreneur, juggling everything from marketing to fashion to writing to exporting to building — and all these because I believe in myself,” she said.

323,['2/03/2020'],Kerala fishermen stranded in Iran after Covid-19 curbs,"Thiruvananthapuram: Indian embassy in Iran is taking stock of the situation of a group of Indian fishermen , including Malayalis, are stranded . Iran has imposed curbs with regard to Covid-19 According to reports, around 200 fishermen, including 17 from the southern coast of Kerala, are stranded in Iran as the Covid-19-hit country has clamped severe restrictions on the movement of people.Union minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan said the Indian embassy in Iran is assessing the gravity of the situation there and would take appropriate steps to ensure the security and welfare of Indians stranded there.Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan also wrote to Union minister for external affairs S Jaishankar urging him to direct the embassy there to take steps to help the stranded fishermen.A video shared by one of the trapped fishermen on Facebook on Sunday morning claimed the situation there as very serious as the fishermen who reached Iran as workers in a fishing company were running short of food and medicine since they were not allowed to step out of their lodgings. Their sponsor too had expressed helplessness and advised the fisherfolk to get in touch with the government authorities here, the video claimed.State fisheries minister J Mercykutty Amma said the government was taking all possible steps to ensure that fishermen stranded there don’t run short of basic facilities, including food and medicine. “We are not sure about how many Malayali fishermen are actually stranded in Iran. According to reports, they account to hundreds. How many are stranded there would be known only after their relatives here share their details with Norka. Once such details are with us, we would hand over the same to Union ministry of external affairs for further action,” she said said.However, unconfirmed sources said 17 among the fishermen caught up in Iran belong to the southern coast of Kerala, especially Vizhinjam and Pozhiyoor areas. “What we can do is to ensure that their basic needs are taken care of. Since they are in a foreign country that fights the coronavirus outbreak, those stationed there now will have to comply with the rules and restrictions that country imposes,” the minister said. “I am not sure about evacuating them now as all flights have been cancelled,” she said. The minister also appealed to the media not to create a scare about the crisis.The Tamil Nadu government had taken up the issue with the Union government on Saturday.

324,['2/03/2020'],PTR gets 3 mist blowers to fight forest fires,"Pilibhit: The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has gifted three mist blowers to Pilibhit Tiger Reserve for protecting the forest from fires.

According to sources, fire alerts in as many as 184 spots in Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) were sent last year by Dehradun-based Forest Survey of India (FSI). The fires were detected with the help of GPS (global positioning system). Most of the fires took place in Mala, Mahof and Barahi forest range areas. One mist blower each would be provided to Mala, Mahof and Barahi forest ranges.

On his part, field director of PTR H Rajamohan has issued directions to range officers of all five forest ranges to conclude fire line work by the first week of March. The fire line work is an annual exercise that helps block forest fires from spreading from one part to another.

Rajamohan said, “Directions have also been issued to set up one crew station in each of all the 54 forest beats for prompt assembly of forest force personnel in case any fire is reported in the jungle.” This would help fight fires promptly.

“The fire lines will be laid along all first and second roads in every forest beat,” he added. The task entails clearing fallen leaves and organic matter from the area as these cause surface and underground fires in forests.

Naresh Kumar, project manager of WWF, said, “We have provided three high-speed devices to PTR while another three have been sent to Valmiki Tiger Reserve in Bihar.”

Giving details, Kumar said each mist blower has 50 cc (cubic centimeter) capacity of spraying air under high pressure. The prime function of this fire fighting device is to blow away heaps of fallen dry leaves and organic litter from the ground to a considerable distance so as to completely check fire from spreading to the rest of the jungle parts. Water or chemicals can also be used for spraying when possible and if needed, sources added.

Rajamohan said, “There is a high risk of fire, specially during wheat harvesting period, when farmers burn crop residue despite a ban in the fields near forest areas.

“Although, we constantly get fire alerts from FSI, we have constituted special teams of trained forest personnel to maintain vigilance against any fire or smoke from the 100-foot high fire towers,” Rajamohan added.

325,['2/03/2020'],UDH tells civic bodies not to pay cash relief for land acquisition,"Jaipur: With coffers running dry after a prolonged real estate slump, the urban development and housing ( UDH ) department has directed civic bodies not to pay cash compensation against land acquisition made in public interest.

The department has proposed to give only 25 per cent of developed land in the project after the land acquisition after the state government’s approval. A senior official said, “Providing cash compensation is a burden on the civic agencies. This hampers the development projects across the state.”

Many believe the move might lead to more protests in the state as owners whose lands are acquired might not settle for compensation without cash.

Nagendra Singh, who is protesting for fair compensation after farmers’ land was acquired for Ninder Housing scheme said, “The state government cannot decide options for land owners. Both the choices should be given. Many owners require cash for constructing houses and other arrangements.”

The officials are also apprehensive that this may hamper projects in the city as affected owners might approach the court after the civic body acquires their land.

An official source at JDA said, “Land for Bais Godam elevated road has been acquired from house owners along the road. Few are demanding cash compensation. In such cases, it is necessary to provide compensation as people might approach the court.”

In the past, lack of funds for land acquiring is obstructing the construction many projects including Ring Road. An official said on Agra Road, the JDA has to acquire 3,200 square-metre land from a petrol pump to construct clover leaves structures. However, the settlement cannot be done as funds are exhausted.

Sources said pressure on the JDA to repay installments of approximately Rs 1,600 crore is mounting. The JDA has taken loans totalling Rs 2,250 crore from NCRPB for the city's major projects. The JDA sought funds from the Centre for ROBs and the elevated road. “The JDA is desperate to earn revenue as it has to pay approximately Rs 30 crore installments against the loan taken from National Capital Regional Planning Board for Dravyawati River and Railway over-bridge,” said a senior official source

“We are planning to conduct a satyagraha protest which would go on till March 6. We are hoping to send a message to the general public about the injustice we have faced through this demonstration,” said Fr Sleeba Paul Vattuvelil, priest trustee of the Jacobite faction.

He added that the protest was against the takeovers of the churches by the rival faction with the help of police. “Locks are being broken open, doors are being damaged and the faithful are driven away from the church before forcefully handing it over to the rival faction. We are grieving and through the satyagraha, we are hoping to open the eyes of the authorities,” he said.

The protest achieves significance as a case regarding the takeover of Mar Thoma Cheriapally, an important church located in the Jacobite stronghold of Kothamangalam is under the consideration of the Kerala high court. The takeover could lead to a chaotic situation as the Jacobites have been campaigning to resist the takeover for the past several weeks.

He found a matter where at least 84 shops came up alongside the boundary wall of the district magistrate office and have been running for decades.

Upon questioning, the commissioner was informed that no rent was being recovered from these shops which left the officer red-faced. He ordered an inquiry into the matter following which the officials concerned have now started searching for decade-old files of the shops in question.

On February 26, during his inspection, commissioner found that all 84 shops had deposited the rent till 1998, but after that no rental record was found with the officials at nazarat’s office.

Sources at the collectorate said that earlier officials at the nazarat’s office had stopped maintaining the shop rent register and in the following years their successors also didn’t pay much heed. Even some senior officials came to know about the issue now.

On Sunday, additional district magistrate VK Singh said that they would charge cumulative rent of previous years from the shops following the rate of the rent mentioned in the rent agreement. “We are examining the records to learn the exact status of all shops before issuing them notice to deposit rent as some of them may be unauthorised. Rent will be charged only from those shops with whom the rent agreement was signed in the past while action will be initiated against the illegal ones,” he added.

PILIBHIT: A 40-year-old dhaba owner was attacked with acid on the face by unidentified persons while he was asleep outside his establishment situated in front of LH Distillery on Bhind-Lipulekh highway under Sungarhi police station.

The victim, identified as Jindal Babu, is a resident of Nabdia Sharifganj village under Barkhera police station. Acid was thrown on him at about 11 pm on Saturday. He was first shifted to the district hospital in Pilibhit and doctors there, referred him to Rohilkhand Medical College in Bareilly.

Police are yet to ascertain why he was attacked.

According to complainant Dharmendra Singh , he was informed about the acid attack by his father. His 12-year-old cousin, Vikas, who was sleeping on another bed beside his father, woke up and started screaming for help. The attackers fled. His father immediately rushed to the adjacent handpump and washed his face, said Dharmendra.

THRISSUR: Customs officials in Thrissur on Saturday seized 4.52kg gold worth Rs 1.93 crore and arrested one person.

According to customs sources, the excise team seized the illegal gold from Arjun Sing, 35, a resident of Rajasthan , near Puthenpalli in Thrissur town on Saturday evening. The accused had come from Mumbai to hand over the gold to a jeweller in the Puthenpalli area.

“The accused did not possess any documents related to the gold purchase. He was produced before the economic offences court in Ernakulam and remanded till March 13,” the source said, adding that Arjun was part of the smuggled gold handling syndicate in the country. “We suspect that he has close links with jewellery shops in Thrissur and has been regularly supplying gold to them,” added the officer.

The customs officials, however, wondered how Arjun was not intercepted by customs officials at checkpoints like the airports or sea ports there. “We call it town seizure as the gold has reached domestic areas, crossing first checkpoints. We are investigating how he smuggled the gold into the country, his source and to whom he was planning to sell,’’ a senior customs official said.

Officials are also investigating whether Arjun was a courier for other contrabands like foreign currency or drugs.

330,['2/03/2020'],"Ejaz Lakdawala: Gangster Lakdawala’s cousin, a top builder, held in extortion ring","Nadeem Lakdawala had allegedly provided contact details of the complainant to Ejaz

MUMBAI: The city crime branch on Saturday arrested developer Nadeem Abdul Sattar Lakdawala , 49, whose construction firm Hicons has built several high-end luxury towers on narrow plots in Bandra-Khar over the past decade, in an extortion racket involving his cousin and gangster Ejaz Lakdawala .

Ejaz Lakdawala has been arrested earlier. Police claim Nadeem was the gangster’s mole and had allegedly passed on the mobile numbers of the victim, Khalid Qureshi, a member of the Waqf Board.

A lookout notice had been issued for Nadeem, who was arrested as soon as he arrived from Jeddah. The developer owns stud farms in Lonavla and is the fourth person to be arrested for aiding and abetting the gangster.

Held for extortion, ‘mole’ Nadeem likely to face MCOCA charges too

Nadeem has been booked under the IPC sections for extortion and criminal conspiracy and is likely to also face charges under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA).

Police informers Salim Maharaj, Faiyyaz Sannata and Dawood aide Tariq Parveen had been arrested earlier for aiding and abetting Ejaz Lakdawala in the extortion racket.

Anti-extortion cell officers said Ejaz had revealed during interrogation that Nadeem had provided information and contact details of Khalid Qureshi and his brother Imran. “To scare Qureshi into giving in to his demand for extortion, Ejaz had even sent pictures Qureshi pictures of his son on WhatsApp,” said police officer.

Inspector Ajay Sawant said a lookout notice was issued against Nadeem since he remained absconding.

Police had arrested Ejaz’s daughter Sonia alias Shifa earlier this year as they suspected she was involved in the extortion case, but she was later discharged.

Qureshi had lodged a complaint in November 2019 that Ejaz was threatening him and had demanded a huge sum. With Ejaz continuing to dodge the police, they maintained surveillance on his daughter. When they got information that she was in contact with her father, who was in Nepal, they arrested her just as she was about to catch a flight to Nepal on a fake passport along with her three-month-old daughter. Ejaz, who is wanted in more than 25 offences, was shunting between India and Nepal via Bihar until recently. The mobile numbers used by Ejaz to threaten Qureshi helped cops trace him to Patna.

331,['2/03/2020'],Illegal mud roads affect water supply,"Kozhikode: The unauthorized construction of mud roads across the branch canals of Kuttiady Canal is affecting the flow of water in many areas. While the flow is completely disrupted in some areas, the flow is partially affected in many areas in Payyoli , Kuttiady, Maruthonkara .

The mud roads or mud walkways are constructed by the residents to ease their movement. The construction works are carried out when the shutters of the Kuttiady canal remains closed.

“The situation is worse in Payyoli municipality and Kuttiady areas,” said Koyilandy MLA K Dasan. The unauthorized construction activities are carried out without the knowledge of the irrigation department officials, who are the custodians of the canal, he said.

The disrupted flow of water through the branch canal affects the water distribution through branch canals , distribution canals and feeder canals. The Kuttiady canal has 10 branch canals and many distribution and feeder canals.

The Kuttiady canal covers 603km. The canal passes through 43 grama panchayats, three municipalities and the city corporation in the district.

Due to the unauthorized construction activities across the branch and feeder canals , water supplied through the canal is yet to reach many areas in the district including areas in Kozhikode city limit. The shutters of the canal were opened on February 20 by the irrigation department to address drought situation.

Usually water reaches the branch canals, distribution canals and feeder canals in a week. Shutters of branch canals are opened when water reaches all the branch canals.

“We have decided to direct the local self-government bodies to carry out inspection in their limits to detect unauthorized constructions,” said Dasan. All unauthorized mud structures will be demolished and mud removed with the help of the MGNREGA workers, he said.

The unauthorized opening of the shutters of branch canals and breaking of the shutters by anti-social elements were the key cause for the disruption of water supply two years ago. However, the situation could be addressed to a great extent with constant inspection by irrigation department officials and police action against the offenders, said an official with the irrigation department.

Last year, water distribution to many areas were disrupted owing to inadequate repair work of the canal stretches. The residents of Maniyoor, Thiruvalloor, Moodadi, Thikkodi and nearby areas were worst hit during last summer.

332,['2/03/2020'],"Unlike phase-1, metro phase-2 work won’t hinder traffic much","Chennai: Sturdy steel sheets to be laid on the road to cover underground construction sites will allow smooth flow of traffic when Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) begins work on the phase-2 network in June 2020. The sheets will replace barricading, which takes up most part of the road causing congestion. CMRL will use the metal sheets to cover all trenches dug to build underground station boxes along the 118.9-km phase-2.

Called the decking technique, metal sheets about 5mm thick will be placed on the roads to cover shafts sunk into the soil on either side of the road for the construction of underground stations and tunnels, a metro rail official said. A portion of these large shafts will later serve as the entry/exit points to the station. The sheets, which will be on the road level, will be 3m wide on either side of the road and sturdy enough to withstand heavy vehicles and traffic movement. The sheets will also have support railing underneath.

“Decking will ensure continuous movement of traffic. This is one of the new methods we are adopting to minimise hassles for commuters during phase-2 work,” a metro rail official said.

CMRL came up with this idea after traffic movement in the core parts of the city such as Anna Salai, Poonamallee High Road and Arcot Road were severely affected during the construction of the 45km phase-1, which took almost a decade. Even then trenches cut on either sides of the road on Anna Salai when construction was underway for LIC and Thousand Lights stations had been covered with sturdy metal sheets in a few places.

While the sides will have the metal sheets replacing barricades, the centre of the road above planned underground metro stations, where the soil will be cut open, will be barricaded. “We may barricade the sides of the road only when we build the underground station’s diaphragm wall. Otherwise, we would occupy only the centre of the road,” the official said.

This means that 10,000 or more students each year are out of the mainstream education system, unable to acquire a degree, diploma or postgraduate diploma. This figure is baffling for officials at the regional centre in Goa of the Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU), a varsity established by an act of the parliament. The university’s centre in the state is now planning to go all out to plug this gap.

G Shrinivas, who has just rejoined as the centre’s assistant regional director, said that he has conceptualised a ‘Har ghar graduate’ programme for the state, where the IGNOU centre will tie-up with the directorate of panchayats to hold spot admission camps in even the most remote villages.

“There are many areas in Goa, in the villages, where there is not a single graduate in the family. It makes a huge difference to have one person graduate in the family. It transforms the outlook of the entire family. We want to tie-up with the directorate of panchayats and first hold an orientation seminar for all sarpanchas. Students will be enrolled on the spot for diploma and graduate programmes,” said Shrinivas.

He said that, at a time when the Union government has set a target of taking the gross enrolment ratio in higher education among the youth to 40%, IGNOU can play a key role in helping achieve this in Goa.

Shrinivas said that he similarly plans to tie-up with the directorate of education to hold an orientation programme for principals of higher secondary schools.

“We want to help principals upgrade their skills by enrolling them for our PG diploma in education management. I have also already discussed it with chief minister Pramod Sawant about helping existing employees in government or government-funded organisations to upgrade their skills,” he said.

Some team members remained on standby with tools as others took their solar-assisted car prototype for yet another assessment which comprises checking fitness of the vehicle on several parameters on the campus.

The competition got more intense as the five-day National Solar Vehicle Challenge (NSVC), said be to organized for the first time in the state from February 28, reached third stage on Sunday with final endurance test of vehicle slated for the final day of the event.

The e-cars , which run on batteries and get charged simultaneously through solar panels on them, will be driven two hours non-stop on the campus roads before winner is announced for the Rs1lakh cash prize.

The event is kind of an exam for the interdisciplinary team of students who have been preparing for this contest since a year now, says electrical department faculty member Ritesh Keshri. VNIT’s in-house clubs, Team Velocity and Team Tesla, in association with the department and Dynamist Motorsports have organized the challenge. The previous edition was held in Bangalore near the KIADB Airport area.

On Sunday, the e-cars, manufactured by the students, were tested for steering dynamics, braking, cross road, and suspension on a 50-metre stretch in front of the hostel. The cars have been fitted with solar panel on the roof to continuously catch sunlight while on the go. The batteries are charged simultaneously.

“All of them performed well. Those not meeting the criteria are given more chances after correcting the shortcomings, if any,” Keshri said.

The faculty member said the vehicles were also ran without any batteries to check direct transmission of solar power to the motor.

“The vehicles can reach a top speed of up to 40 kmph and have enough charge for two-hour which is good for making city transport pollution free,” said VNIT’s Solaris Team member.

Hyderbad-based Rudhra team added another panel that appears as its bonnet. “We wanted to make it light, more efficient as compared to other EVs,” they said.

Nagpur: The heavily skewed equation of only 10 offences registered against 471 complaints in 2019 by six police stations of zone III of city police seemed to have left senior cops upset.

The issue of functioning of cyber cells in Maharashtra was raised during the ongoing assembly session which also highlighted manpower constraints and issues of pending complaints.

The complaints, forwarded by cyber cell of crime branch, were meant for police stations to probe after registering offences. Not only there had been failure in registering FIRs, little less than 50% of the complaints (242) are still pending for reasons best known to the personnel manning the respective police stations.

A response through RTI underlined the fact that cyber cell had received 3,023 complaints in 2019. Around 2,100 were sent to different police stations, but 251 are still pending and 672 were closed without action.

Around 109 complaints were referred to Pachpaoli police station, but no FIR was registered. On top of it, 84 remained pending since 2019. Another 101 complaints were sent to Lakadganj police station, but only two were converted into FIRs with 31 still pending. Another 90 complaints were sent to Kotwali police station and only three FIRs were registered while 43 still remain pending.

Additional CP Nilesh Bharne, crime, sounded stunned by the high number of pending applications at police station level. “The complaints should not be delayed as it tantamount to ignoring the grievances of the citizens,” he said.

Bharne has now directed cyber cell to refer the complaints to him before forwarding them to police stations. “We would now refer complaints to police stations with direct remark to register offence if there is a strong case,” he said.

The cyber cell, during 2017 and 2018, had a dream run when it had managed to return amounts to the tune of several lakhs before being siphoned off by online fraudsters. The performance of cyber cell nosedived from 2019. There have been no significant detections too.

Though several cyber cells in the state have been converted into police stations, city police are yet to take a decision on the status of it’s unit.

An officer, on the condition of anonymity, said there is dearth of officers to probe the cases pertaining to cyber offences under Information Technology (IT) Act. “Only an officer of inspector rank or above can probe cases under IT Act. At present, there are only two inspectors at cyber cell ,” he said.

337,['2/03/2020'],Violence in Delhi: Residents stick together in island of peace,"Phase-VII of Shiv Vihar has turned into a virtual ghost town

NEW DELHI: Having borne the brunt of the riots, Phase-VII of Shiv Vihar has turned into a virtual ghost town. But Gali No. 14, in the middle of the colony, stands out as an exception. Some are calling it an island of peace, as stories emerge of how Hindus and Muslims risked their lives to save each other when the violence was at its peak. Most houses are largely untouched in this lane, thanks to this show of strength.

Shiva Kumar (62), who guards the wooden log at the entry gate, said people from both communities joined hands to keep the rioters away. Different groups, with their own sets of slogans, descended on the colony on Monday night, Kumar recalled. “We saved our lives in this storm by begging, pleading and touching feet of these people,” he said. Residents said they prevented attacks by hiding the identities of the people from the different set of rioters.

They said there were a few local participants too in the violence, but the mobs mostly comprised outsiders. Bhanvar Singh, a vegetable-seller, said Hindus and Muslims have lived together for over 30 years in the colony. “Not a single lock has been broken in our lane. We live in brotherhood. No one can hurt you if you stick together,” he said. While the rest of the colony is in ruins, Singh’s comments ring true when you look at Gali No. 14.

Mohammad Aamir, another resident, said: “People helped each other out and that’s why our houses survived. People came in two trucks from the Loni side (to attack),” he said. Lal Devi added: “We lied and protected our identities. We are staying on to save our houses as well as that of our neighbours,” she said. Many people, however, have fled. “I don’t know where she (her neighbour) is now. When she was here, we used to laugh and cry together. But now there is only silence. I miss her,” Devi said.

338,['2/03/2020'],Raj leads in learning outcomes: MHRD survey,"EDITED

Jaipur: Rajasthan scored the highest points in the category of ‘learning outcomes and quality’ of education in government schools among the states and the union territories.

The category is one of the five categories further divided into a total of 70 subcategories to form the performance grading index (PGI) report 2017-18 released by the MHRD on February 27. The desert state ranked among the top five states in the PGI.

Leading the pack among the states and union territories are Chandigarh, Gujarat and Kerala. These states are listed in grade I category as their aggregate score is between 801-850 while Rajasthan stood in the grade II along with Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Haryana and D&N Haveli for having aggregate score between 751 and 800.

“Rajasthan scored 168 out of 180 to lead in the country in the important parameter of learning outcomes and quality,” reads the report. The learning outcomes are defined by the students’ academic performance in reading, comprehension and mathematics. The state performed poorly in two categories — infrastructure & facilities and access. It scored 84 out of 140 and 56 out of 80, respectively. The poor performance in the access category means that the state has poor retention, transition rate and high dropout rate.

“It is good that the state is doing significantly well in equity category, which means lesser difference in performance among the SC, ST vis-à-vis general category students. The state stood 10th in the combined category of union territory and states. The efforts of the consecutive governments are delivering positive results,” said KB Kothari, an educationist.

The learning outcomes are considered the most important domain and the ultimate goal of the index.

The total weightage under the PGI is 1,000 points with each of the 70 indicators assigned a weightage of either 10 or 20 points. The aim of the report is to inform the state government on areas of improvements. The percentage of average daily attendance of teachers recorded in electronic attendance system, too, is very good in the state.

With regard to its directions for regular visit of doctors to nari niketans, government counsel informed the court that since all the seven government nari niketans are located at the divisional headquarters, the superintendent of the medical college of each divisional headquarters would have better resources to send doctors to these institutions on a regular basis.

While hearing a habeas corpus petition, division bench comprising Justice Sandeep Mehta and Justice Vijay Bishnoi directed the secretary of the local bodies department to issue instructions to all the municipal bodies to install open air gyms in the nari niketans, balika gruhs and the observations homes all over the state.

The court has sought submission of the compliance report in this regard for its perusal on the next date of hearing on March 18.

While submitting the affidavits in the court in relation to the directions issued by the court during previous hearings, AAG Pankaj Sharma apprised the court that 6 ANMs have been posted on deputation in each nari niketan other than Jaipur as an ANM was already posted at the nari niketan here.

“In addition, seven posts of special women educators have also been created one for each nari niketan at the divisional headquarters in compliance of the direction of the court,” Sharma informed the court.

Referring to the chalking out of a common format for inspection reports of the nari niketans by the Dy. secretary, Rajasthan State Legal Services Authority (RSLSA), the court further directed that these formats should be incorporated in the reporting system and be forwarded to all the nari niketans in the state so that the compliance reports are received in a common format.

Besides this, the court also sought a compliance report of its direction to take steps for imparting skill development training to the inmates in these institutions.

The unrecognised units are trying to cash in on the increasing demand for bubble tops .

A member of the Packaged Drinking Water Manufacturers Association said the illegal units are active in suburbs such as Kumananchavadi and added that water filled in unhygienic conditions is being sold. Highlighting that the association had time and again raised the issue of such illegal units cropping up, he requested the authorities to regularise the units by issuing licences and ensuring they complied with safety standards.

In areas such as Red Hills, branded bubble top cans are filled with water from tankers and sold to people at a higher price, he warned.

Cost of bubble top cans continued to increase, with branded ones sold for Rs 100 in many parts of the city. The cheaper ones were unavailable, said shop owners in Adyar and Tiruvanmiyur.

NAGPUR: It was a liberating day for the several differently abled people of the country who were provided with free artificial limbs at the inauguration of a weeklong artificial limbs fitment camp in the city. Many who came in on wheelchairs, walked out on their own feet as the highly advanced technology replaced their missing limbs.

This technology of artificial limbs today is giving a new lease of life to several disabled people who once thought that they might never be able to lead normal life.

The fitment camp was inaugurated by Chief Justice of India Justice Sharad Bobde on Sunday at MLA Hostel. The programme was jointly organized by Mahavir International Service Trust , BMVSS and the National and State Legal Services Authorities.

CJI Bobde said, “This is an occasion to celebrate humanity. There is a higher state of consciousness today where a human evolves to a point where he looks at the sufferings of others and decides to do something about it.”

Bhagwan Mahaveer Viklang Sahayata Samiti (BMVSS) is a pioneer in the field of artificial limbs. This organization, which is the world’s largest organization for disabled, is the brainchild of DR Mehta who realized the need of an institutionalized arrangement for helping poor people who have lost limbs only after he himself met with a serious road accident.

There was also a demonstration by few differently abled people who walked, jumped, ran and gallivanted easily from one place to the other after the fitment of these artificial limbs. The highlight of the event was when 3-year-old Icchha jumped with joy and ran across the stage with her new limb.

Supreme Court judge Justice Bhushan Gavai said, “This is God’s work. There is a presence of the divine being in this team.”

The programme was heavily attended by the members of the legal fraternity. Supreme Court judges Justice Surya Kant, Justice S Ravindra Bhat along with retired SC judge Justice VS Sirpurkar were present.

Acting Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court Justice Bhushan Dharmadhikari, Senior Administrative Judge of the Nagpur bench of Bombay HC Justice Ravi Deshpande, Lokayukta of Odisha Justice Ajit Singh, retired Bombay HC judge Justice RC Chavan, all judges of Nagpur bench of Bombay HC and HCBA members were also present.

AGRA: The Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University exams for session 2019-20 are scheduled to begin on Monday, but many students have claimed that they have not received their admit cards.

More than 27,000 students enrolled in 12 courses are scheduled to appear for the exam. According to the university officials, the exams will be conducted across 100 centres.

The university vice-chancellor Ashok Mittal said the admit cards were uploaded on the website on Sunday, and added that the college administration now have to download and distribute them to the students.

“On Sunday, admit cards of all the students having their exams on Monday have been uploaded on the login IDs of the colleges. The process of physical verification of exam centres has been initiated. It will continue during the exams. Exam enters not found fulfilling the standard norms will be changed. Orders have been issued to remove all the colleges where mass cheating was reported from the list of exam centres,” Mittal said.

Meanwhile, a first-year B.Sc student expressed anguish over the delay in getting the admit card.

“I have biotechnology paper on Monday. But, I have not received my admit card till now. All the students now have to collect the admit card from college before going to the exam centre. The university administration should have uploaded the admit cards at least one week before the exam,” Vinit Kumar said.

Earlier in the day, the authorities of the affiliated colleges had gathered at the Khandari campus in large numbers to get their complaints addressed. Later, police were called in by the university administration to control the situation.

A principal of a private affiliated college, on the condition of anonymity, said, “The university administration has failed to make the arrangements to conduct exams on time. Major malpractices have taken place in the determination of exam centres. A day before the exam, the university officials are determining the exam centres. The admit card has only been uploaded today. Such last-minute decisions are going to hamper the students.”

Moreover, the principal alleged that some exam centres are more than 10 km away from the parent college, which is in clear violation of the state government orders.

He also claimed that no physical inspection of colleges was conducted by the university administration to check the availability of CCTV cameras and voice recorders in classrooms as mandated by the state government.

343,['2/03/2020'],15 localities hit by poor water supply due to pipeline leaks,"Representative image

AGRA: Water supply in at least 15 localities in the city was affected on Sunday due to leakages in supply pipelines and other mechanical faults. Residents said despite several complaints, the Jal Sansthan failed to send water tanks to the affected areas.

Due to leakages in the pipelines, water supply was affected in 15 localities, including Awas Vikas, Sikandra, Dayalbagh , trans Yamuna, Baluganj, Mantola, Subhas Bazaar , Transport Nagar , Kailash Road, Balkeshwar locality, Belanganj, Daresi, Rawatpara, Noori Darwaza, Shahganj, Madia Katra, Lohamandi and Idgah.

In some localities foul smelling contaminated water was supplied. These included Awas Vikas, Sadar Bhatti, Prakash Nagar , Chandra Nagar , parts of Dayalbagh and Kamla Nagar.

Water supply in the Old City areas is dependent on Jeevani Mandi waterworks station whereas half of the city gets its supply from Sikandra waterworks. Both these pumping stations are not working to their full capacity. Besides, some 20 leakages on supply pipelines maintained by Jal Sansthan result in wastage of thousands of litres of water in different parts of the city every day.

It is estimated that least 50 million litres per day (MLD) of water is wasted in the city due to pipeline leakages. So far, Jal Sansthan has no city-wide plan to check the situation. Its ad hoc arrangements in dealing with the problem of pipeline leakages are temporary in nature, which last for short periods.

RS Yadav, general manager of Agra Jal Sansthan, said “We are working to fix all the leakages. Pipeline are too old and weak. They are not able to bear the pressure of water and spring leaks. We are working on a plan to lay new piplines in areas where frequent leakages take place.”

NEW DELHI: Three more bodies were recovered from a drain in northeast Delhi on Sunday. Hospital authorities, however, said that they had not received any bodies. Dr Sunil Kumar, medical director of GTB Hospital, claimed there were no new deaths. “The toll at GTB stands at 38,” he said. The total number of deaths stand at 42.

Two bodies were pulled out from the drain that runs through Bhagirathi Vihar in Gokulpuri and another from a drain in Shiv Vihar. “None of the three bodies has been identified. Whether they are of riot victims or not can only be ascertained after postmortem,” a cop said.

Delhi Police said no call was received in the control room regarding rioting in the last four days. “A total of 254 cases have been registered; 41 of them are under Arms Act. Over 900 people have been detained. The situation under control,” Mandeep Randhawa, PRO, Delhi Police, said.

On Sunday evening, their were reports of a man being beaten up by a group of people in the inner lanes of Bhajanpura. While the victim, Basant Jha, has not filed a complaint with Delhi Police as he is a resident of Ghaziabad, his brother told TOI that he had received injuries and his car was damaged.

Jha who was travelling from Bawana to Ghaziabad was allegedly stopped by a group and beaten up with an iron rod. “The incident took place between 4 pm and 5pm. My brother works in the hardware sector and had gone to Bawana buy some material. When he was returning, some of the main roads leading towards Ghaziabad were barricaded. He was forced to take the internal roads, as suggested by the internet navigation system,” he said. “Somewhere near Begumpur in Bhajanpura, a group of men stopped his car. Initially, Basant refused to come out, but when they started damaging his car, he had to. They also checked his identity,” he claimed.

Situation in most parts of northeast Delhi, however, remained peaceful with police as well as paramilitary officers deployed in large numbers.

Meanwhile, the SIT team is focusing on murder cases first. Once investigation of these cases is streamlined, the probe will move on to other violent and assault cases, an officer said.

Cops have also been carrying out raids in search of suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, who has been booked in the murder case of Ankit Sharma, an IB official whose body was fished out from a drain. Police sources revealed that Tahir switched off his phone on February 27 at 10pm. His last location was near Dayalpur. The mobile number of a man who was coordinating with the media on behalf of Tahir was also switched off, they added.

However, the police managed to rescue the victim, Palashev Rodaslav, and arrest the kidnappers late on Saturday.Both the accused, Anoop Dagar (36) and Naveen Dagar (29), are members of the Rajesh Bawania gang and belong to Jharoda Kalan village of southwest Delhi. Anoop is a notorious criminal and a land-grabber in the area. In 2014, he and his associates had murdered a property dealer in a dispute over a piece of land.At 10.30pm on Thursday, Rodaslav had gone to the ATM to withdraw money with his friend, George, also a Bulgarian. The two criminals saw them and got inside the ATM. They first robbed them of Rs 1 lakh and then asked Rodaslav to accompany them as they wanted more money. They took Rodaslav, while George rushed back to his apartment. He did not share the incident with anyone. Around midnight, he received a ransom call from the kidnappers demanding Rs 2 crore for Rodaslav’s release.Scared, George opened up to their common friend, Anand, whose apartment they were living in. Anand, a doctor by profession, had met the two in Armenia while pursuing an MBBS course and had invited them to India. Rodaslav is a software engineer, while George is a businessman.

We also received a tip-off that a foreign national was seen with two Indian men near Jharoda Kalan in a white car having a Haryana registration number,” DCP (Dwarka) Anto Alphonse said.The police team decided to lay a trap for the kidnappers at the spot in Jhraoda where George had been called alone to deliver the ransom.The cops were stationed in private vehicles and plain clothes. However, the kidnappers did not turn up, which indicated that they had sensed police presence. The cops then started scanning the nearby roads and fund a white i20 near Gate 2 of the CRPF camp in the area.When the vehicle was intercepted, the kidnappers opened fire at the police team. The cops opened fire too and flattened the car’s tyres. The criminals tried to run away, but were chased by the cops.

LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath stressed on not creating panic over diseases, but focusing on solutions and making systematic action plans for tackling them.

Inaugurating the fifth Mukhyamantri Arogya Mela at the primary health centre in Aurangabad, Sarojininagar area of Lucknow on Sunday, Yogi said, “From 1977-78 to 2016, around 500 to 1,500 children died within three to four months every year because of dreaded Japanese encephalitis .”

“Instead of creating panic, our government focused on solutions and making a systematic action plan. We launched a massive campaign against the disease and the death toll due to JE has reduced by 90%, while the incidence is down by 60% in last three years,” Yogi said. Dengue and Kalazar can also be controlled like this, the CM added.

He urged media not to create fear in the name of diseases, and said, “When weather changes, people catch cold. It is flu, and the cause of its spread gives names like swine flu and bird flu. We need to make people aware about this. The health department should be alert and prepare a better action plan to fight the disease.”

He directed health department to prepare an action plan against flu and said special wards should be set up in hospitals in advance to stop it from spreading.

“A vaccination campaign is beginning today in which children from 1 to 15 years will be vaccinated. It will continue till March 31. ‘Dastak’ abhiyan workers will visit all primary health centers and secondary schools and vaccinate those who have not been vaccinated,” he said.

In April 2018, UP government had launched ‘Dastak’ campaign in 38 districts to beat encephalitis.

Four health fairs have been organized so far, in which more than 22 lakh people have received treatment, the chief minister added.

The UP cane department’s data shows that cane purchase dues have been paid 100% by corporation and cooperative sugar mills for 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19, while private mills have cleared 99.91% dues for 2016-17, 99.87% for 2017-18 and 98.1% for 2018-19.

However, in the ongoing crushing season, the mills have paid Rs 11,096.90 crore, against total dues of Rs 19,239 crores, with Rs 8,142 crore — around 43% of total dues — still pending.

Data further shows that the three corporation mills paid only Rs 71.38 crore against total dues of Rs 248 crore, with Rs 176 crore still outstanding. Similarly, 24 cooperative mills have still to pay Rs 675 crore, while 92 private mills have still to clear Rs 7,290 crore to farmers. A senior official of cane department said, “The payment of dues was prioritized to ensure that the pending payments of previous years are cleared. Now, the dues of current season would be taken up.”

UP Sugar Mills Association (UPSMA), meanwhile, said mills are having huge buffer stock which is being sold in open market very slowly. “The sugar stock for festive season has been exhausted, resulting in lowering of prices,” said a UPSMA office-bearer.

Sugar experts said the millers are weighing the options of diverting part of molasses for manufacture of ethanol to meet financial crunch and generate funds to clear off cane dues to farmers.The cane dues in current crushing season are still high despite UP government not increasing the state advisory price for the third year in a row.

Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is duty bound to initiate action against unauthorized use of basement parking area but it seldom takes any steps. Now, flouting its own norms, the civic body has been caught storing scrap in the lower basement parking of its new administrative building in Civil Lines.

Despite being in use for the last seven years, the building is yet to secure fire compliance and occupancy certificates, which too are major violations as per the civic body’s own rules. TOI has reported this regularly in the past.

The seven-storey building is having parking space in lower and upper basements. Lower basement is in use since 2014 for two-wheelers. Four-wheelers are supposed to be parked in lower basement but it wasn’t in use until recently.

Tukaram Mundhe, soon after taking charge on January 28, got upset over haphazard parking of cars by employees and visitors on the sprawling premises in front of the building.

The NMC engineers then marked parking lots and started action against vehicles in no-parking areas. Car parking too started in the lower basement area.

A few days ago, some NMC employees and visitors alerted TOI about bad condition of the lower basement parking. Many old cupboards, chairs, tables, handcart etc were found dumped in the basement parking. While shifting offices from old to new building, employees of a few departments had dumped the scrap there.

Sewage water was found dripping from a damaged pipeline on high voltage electric cables bundled in a case attached to the ceiling. Puddles of black-coloured sewage water as well as scrap were giving out a stinking smell.

Adding to the problems was the poor lighting system in the basement. Also, there is only one ramp for entry and exit of vehicles. Cars parked by a few officials covered almost half the ramp.

Parking and moving around vehicles has become a problem due to the scrap and sewage water. People have to use staircase in absence of a lift.

TOI has sent pictures of scrap and sewage in lower basement parking to Mundhe. According to NMC officials, Mundhe has directed the engineers to clean basement parking immediately and the work has started. It will take sometime to stop the sewage flow. Fire systems have been installed and B-certificate is awaited from the agency concerned. Occupancy certificate will be issued after fire compliance certificate, they said.

The building was proposed in 2002 at the cost of Rs17.99 crore. Construction started in 2003 but missed the deadline of 2004. Only ground floor was completed till 2013. Till then, the cost had increased to Rs57 crore.

The then municipal commissioner Shyam Wardhane and additional municipal commissioner Hemant Kumar Pawar shifted their offices to ground floor so that the officials can expedite works. The building was brought into use in a phased manner.

351,['2/03/2020'],"In view of SC’s Ayodhya verdict, VHP to celebrate 15-day Ram Mahotsav across country","Representative image

AGRA: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) has decided to have an extended celebration of Ram Mahotsav across the country from March 25 this year. During the 15-day event, the VHP would be honouring kar sevak who participated in the 1990 Ayodhya movement and then in the 1992 Babri demolition.

The celebrations, which earlier used to be for 7 days, have been extended to 15 days in view of the favourable SC judgment in the Ram Janmabhoomi case.

Announcing this, VHP’s international joint general secretary SK Jain said that the programmes will start across three lakh villages from March 25 and continue until Hanuman Jayanti , which falls on April 8. He said that every year Ram Utsav is celebrated during Ram Navami but this year the celebrations will be different in view of the apex court verdict in favour of Ram Temple.

According to Jain, every VHP activist wanted to celebrate this event immediately after the judgment, but the organisational leaders felt that it could hurt the sentiments of the other community. “Now is the right time to celebrate,” he said.

He told TOI that kar sevaks, who participated in 1990 and 1992 will also be felicitated during this period. “Workers will also visit villages, from where bricks to construct Ram temple were brought in Ayodhya,” he said, adding that communication will also be established with the Hindus, who are “disturbed due to the violence that broke out at several places after CAA was passed in Parliament”.

“Our aim is to spread Lord Ram’s message to every corner of the nation because people have forgotten it. That is the reason for such kind of disturbed atmosphere in the country,” Jain added.

According to VHP’s Braj region vice-president Sunil Parashar, “Workers will go to villages to garner support for the temple construction. Prabhat pheri, shobha yatras will be organised during this period.”

352,['2/03/2020'],Army factory forced to shut after leopard spotted to reopen today,"Bareilly: The ordnance clothing factory (OCF) in Shahjahanpur Cantonment that temporarily shut its operations on Saturday and Sunday after a leopard was spotted in its premises is expected to resume work on Monday. Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) experts and forests officials who searched every nook and corner of the sprawling factory campus spread over 100 acres for the past two days could not find any fresh traces of the big cat. They have concluded that the animal has moved away from the campus.

Daksh Gangwar from WTI told TOI, “We have installed 12 cameras but there is a least possibility of the presence of the big cat in the factory. We are still staying cautious and monitoring the area.”

The experts have also identified three points from where the leopard may have entered the factory premises.

The big cat was initially spotted by security guards near the blanket manufacturing unit late on Friday night and later its presence was confirmed by CCTV cameras installed on the factory campus. An employee on the night shift captured a few pictures of the animal. Nearly 3,000 employees at the OCF were sent on leave on Saturday as a precaution.

On Saturday morning, a team of experts and foresters began combing the factory premises in search of the leopard. The search went on till Sunday evening, but no signs of the animal’s presence were found. The camera traps set up on campus also did not capture the big cat. All this indicated that it had moved out of the factory campus.

Anurag Yadav, public relationship officer, OCF, said, “We are starting operations from Monday as the forest department has suggested that the leopard has possibly moved out. The wildlife experts are still monitoring the area, using camera traps.”

353,['2/03/2020'],Former babu conned by ‘Vibrant investor’,"Ahmedabad: A retired bureaucrat of the state government has filed a complaint with Gandhinagar police stating that he was cheated of Rs 38,600 by a London-based woman who had contacted him in August 2018 enquiring on how to invest in the state during the Vibrant Gujarat Global Investors’ Summit-2019.

In his FIR with Sector-7 police of Gandhinagar, Dinesh Kapadia, a resident of Sector-4 who retired as member secretary in social justice and empowerment department, stated that the accused Benita Morgan contacted him on Facebook messenger in August 2018.

Morgan had then asked on how she would make investments in the Vibrant Gujarat Summit which was to be held in January 2019 at Mahatma Mandir in Gandhinagar, said Kapadia in the FIR.

Kapadia said that he had just told her that he would guide her on the Vibrant Gujarat Summit and he did it “just on humanitarian ground”. Later, the woman told Kapadia that she would send her a memento out of respect for the help he had done.

On August 21, 2018, Kapadia got a call from a courier company where a man told him that he would need to pay money to get clearance for a parcel which was sent from London. As Kapadia had also received a receipt of that parcel from Morgan, he paid the money through NEFT, states the FIR.

On August 23, 2018, Kapadia again received a call from the courier company and this time he was told to pay Rs 80,000. The courier company told Kapadia to pay the money as the parcel contained a purse worth Rs 30,000 pounds.

Kapadia, this time, realized that he was being duped so he wrote to Delhi police commissioner about the cheating as the courier company was based in New Delhi. As the offence took place in jurisdiction of Gandhinagar police, Kapadia’s application was sent to Gandhinagar SP and finally the complaint was registered at Sector-7 police station.

Sector-7 police have registered a complaint of cheating .

356,['2/03/2020'],State government approves Rs 3cr for mechanised cleaning,"Agra: In a major boost to mechanised cleaning process, the state government has sanctioned Rs 3 crore for the purchase of five machines to improve sanitation and hygiene for areas like MG road, VIP road, i.e. from Kheria Airbase to Taj Mahal, and Jeewani Mandi.

“Soon, three street sweeping machines and two sprinklers will be purchased. The state authorities have given permission. The machines will help us in improving the cleanliness in different parts of the city,” additional municipal commissioner KB Singh said.

Notably, this is not the first that the Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) has gone ahead with mechanised cleaning process.

In 2018, the corporation had purchased 10 litter-picking machines to make the cleaning process dust-free on the MG Road and the vicinity of the Taj Mahal. These included two battery-mounted, four trolly-mounted and four backpack vacuum-litter-picking machines. While the first two functioned on batteries, the rest eight were operated by petrol.

However, three weeks after its use five of the machines broke down and remained non-functional due to lack of maintenance.

Moreover, it was alleged that the AMC administration, before handing over the litter-picking machines to the workers, did not teach the staff how to operate them. With at least five of the ten machines becoming non-functional, the plan stopped mid-way after a while and the workers were again deployed for manual cleaning.

Assuring that the past mistakes won’t be repeated, executive engineer, AMC, Rajiv Rathi told TOI, “This time, we will provide the required training to the sanitation workers on how to operate these machines and we will make sure that the new machines are well maintained.”

When asked about the repairing of the defunct five machines, Rathi said, “The litter picking machines are being repaired.”

Work to link them will begin soon and is expected to be completed by this year end.

While one taxiway links the main and second runway, and the other connects to the main runway and runs parallel to it. Once completed, the taxiways will help planes move out of the runway faster and taxi to the parking bays. Landing and departures won’t be delayed.

“The work is being carried out in small portions so that flight operations are not be affected,” said an official. AAI has floated a tender to finish work pending on the two taxiways. Concreting work, digging a culvert and resurfacing of parking bays are going on near the VIP parking bays and cargo terminals.

The taxiways are part of the phase 2 airport expansion, to increase aircraft handling capacity. AAI aims for Chennai airport to be able to handle more than 40 flights an hour and allow more airlines to have night parking when all pending work is complete.

A bend on the taxiway that runs parallel to the main runway was a bottleneck that slowed down planes as they taxied to the Guindy-end of the main runway. “Straightening of the taxiway is almost complete and final surface work is going on. Work to complete rapid exit taxiways is also on,” said an official. This will speed up planes by at least 10 minutes during take-offs.

In addition to the taxiway work, AAI is also strengthening parking bays and apron bays so that larger planes can be parked and passengers can be boarded. Two parking bays have also been merged so that jumbo planes of the type of B747 can be parked.

The airside expansion work along with a new terminal, which will be ready by September, will augment capacity of the airport to 35 million passengers per year.

Several people came out to open their shops on Saturday evening and Sunday. “I opened my shop yesterday after the tension reduced. Not much harm has happened in the interiors. But why take a chance? It’s the common man who suffers,” said a Confectionery owner.

His brother added, “The DCP came and told us that we should open the shops now so that people realise that things are getting back to normal. However, on Saturday, I closed the shop early by 5pm.”

Another resident of Khajuri Khas Gali No. 2 and the owner of a sweets shop, echoed the sentiments. “The moment trouble started, I downed the shutters and left. Thank god no harm has come to my shop. There are many whose shops and homes have been completely burned.”

In some colonies, people were seen returning to their homes. “I went and stayed with my relatives in Seemapuri for a few days. I came back this morning as it is peaceful now,” said a 24-year-old. Some families were even leaving to attend family weddings. “Since normalcy has sort of returned, we can now go and attend a relative’s wedding in Uttar Pradesh. Life has to move on,” said a woman.

PATNA: Sounding the bugle for the forthcoming assembly polls, JD(U) chief and CM Nitish Kumar on Sunday said if voted to power for the next term, he would do more development work and provide irrigation water to each farm land across the state.

In his 100-minute speech while addressing the party’s ‘Karyakarta Sammelan’ here, Nitish recounted the sector-wise works done by his government during the last 15 years while comparing the state’s current situation with the 15-year regime of Lalu-Rabri (1990-2005).

Trying to dispel confusion among the party workers over his recent meeting with RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav in the state assembly, Nitish said nothing as such (thing) happens if someone comes to meet him. “The NDA is united in Bihar and let us resolve to ensure NDA’s victory with more than 200 seats in the forthcoming assembly polls,” he told the party workers.

Referring to the ongoing controversy over the CAA/NRC/NPR in the country, Nitish said he and his party would not tolerate any kind of injustice and negligence (upeksha) with the members of minority community. “The state government sent a letter to the Centre on February 15 to implement the old 2010 format of National Population Register (NPR) only. PM Narendra Modi himself has cleared confusion over the NRC. We also passed a resolution in the state assembly about the NPR and NRC,” he said.

“As far as the CAA is concerned, the matter is before the Supreme Court. People should have patience till the verdict. Some people are trying to create a situation like 1947 on the CAA issue, but this country is united. It is not going to be divided,” the JD(U) chief said.

Reiterating his demand of caste-based Census, Nitish said, “It is very necessary for many purposes. Once the accurate data of castes is available, it will be helpful in determining the percentage of quota for different reserved castes.”

Nitish said as long as he was in power, ban on liquor would not be lifted. “We are proceeding towards de-addiction,” he said, adding, ”At a meeting of eastern zonal council, I asked the chief ministers of West Bengal and Jharkhand to check liquor smuggling from their states in Bihar.”

Recounting the works done in the health sector, the CM also announced to inaugurate Karpoori Thakur Medical College and Hospital at Madhepura on March 7.

Nitish said he would soon prepare a booklet on the works done by his government and provide it to the party’s booth-level workers. “The workers will go to people and inform them about the works done by us and what was the situation in the state before 2005.”

Reminding that the booth level workers have to play important role during the coming election, Nitish said they should also provide people’s feedback to the party on the government’s work. He asked JD(U) national general secretary (organization) RCP Singh to prepare the workers for taking feedback from the public.

Regarding minority community, Nitish said, “I am not concerned for votes. But people of minority community must remember what works were done for them by the previous governments.

366,['2/03/2020'],SCCL seeks MoEF nod to mine coal within 10km of Shivaram sanctuary,"Hyderabad: The Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) has sought approval from the ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) for mining within a 10km radius of Shivaram Wildlife Sanctuary in Peddapalli district.

“Number of coal-based thermal and cement plants were established in Ramagundam region considering the proximity of SCCL mines. The company has signed long-term fuel supply agreements with these industries by ensuring uninterrupted coal supplies. The proposed project will sustain existing linkage of coal supply to NTPC Ramagundam and cement plants in the region,” SCCL said in its proposals submitted to MoEF.

Though the mine is almost 7km away from the sanctuary, it falls under the proposed eco-sensitive zone. However, the environment ministry is yet to notify the zone. If the project is approved, the new coal mine will occupy 195 hectares of the eco-sensitive zone and 173 hectares of space outside the zone.

In its application to the standing committee of the National Board for Wildlife Clearance (NBWC), SCCL said, “The proposed cluster of Godavarikhani opencast-cum-underground coal mine will be set up at a distance of 7.7 km from the Shivaram Wildlife Sanctuary. As the environment ministry has not declared the eco-sensitive zone, permissions have to be obtained from the NBWC standing committee.”

“Coal mining is site-specific and so no alternative sites can be considered. It is proposed to extract 33.3 metric tonne of coal locked in an underground mine of Godavarikhani No. 5 incline by opencast method. If it is not extracted by surface mining, it will be lost forever. The proposed underground to opencast conversion project falls within 10km of Shivaram Wildlife Sanctuary. External dumping of earthen material is planned to be stacked utilising vacant land available between two villages adjacent to the quarry,” the company stated.

SCCL, the only coal producing company in south India jointly owned by the state and central governments, has been carrying out mining for more than 130 years. It currently operates 29 underground and 19 opencast mines in six districts — Kumaram Bheem, Mancherial, Peddapalli, Jayashankar Bhupalapalli, Bhadradri Kothagudem and Khammam.

367,['2/03/2020'],4L volunteers hit the road at break of dawn to deliver pension to 49L,"Amaravati: In a huge relief to the elderly and physically disabled of the state, village and ward secretaries distributed welfare pensions at their doorsteps on Sunday.

Despite it being a holiday, over four lakh volunteers and nearly 80,000 staff in the village and ward secretariats worked overtime to disburse pension early in the day. By 3pm, over 49 lakh beneficiaries received pension against the total 60 lakh. Senior officials and ministers monitored the distribution process on a real-time basis and expressed satisfaction about the speedy disbursement of funds. On an average, it takes 7-10 days to disburse pension to beneficiaries.

Proving determination to work as per chief minister YS Jagan Mohan’s ambition, the volunteers attached to the village and ward secretariats started work by 5am.

Upon learning about an elderly man from Gattu village of B Kothakota mandal in Chittoor district being admitted to Madanapalle government hospital, a young volunteer, Anand, went all the way to the hospital to hand over his pension. Similarly, another volunteer in Vajrakarur mandal went to an agriculture field to distribute pension of a woman.

Taking the completion of the target as a challenge, the volunteers chalked out a detailed action plan on Saturday itself and started disbursing pension on Sunday. The volunteers distributed nearly Rs 1,384 crore to the different categories of beneficiaries including the elderly, disabled, victims of chronic diseases and transgender persons. “This is the strength of the village/ward secretariat system that has been introduced by YS Jagan. We are taking governance to the next level,” said Panchayat Raj minister Peddireddi Ramachandra Reddy.

Rural development and Panchayat Raj principal secretary Gopalakrishna Dwivedi, who worked as chief electoral officer during the general elections, monitored pension distribution almost like conducting polls, releasing hourly pension disbursement data.

The village volunteers distributed nearly 11 per cent of the pensions by 7am and took it to nearly 25 per cent by 10am. “Over 80 per cent of the pensions were distributed to beneficiaries at their doorstep by 2pm ,” Dwivedi said.

Civil supplies minister Kodali Nani said the amount spent on pensions in January, 2019 when Naidu was at the helm of affairs was just around Rs 490 crore, while their government disbursed a whopping Rs 1,384 crore in a single day.

He said it would be better for the TDP to completely shut down business as people were content with YSRC’s policies and schemes.

Jawan station in-charge Naresh Kumar Singh said that Pinky told police that she did not kill her daughter intentionally. He added that she was frustrated with domestic issues and constant arguments with her husband and took out her frustration on her daughter on Saturday not knowing that she would die.

However, it is a commute that can take anywhere between 45 minutes to two hours one way, in case a student wants to come to the Anna Centenary library or similar institutions to study in peace.

The Avadi Corporation has also planned to have open gyms at Rs 10 lakh each in 16 of its parks, with equipment like the ones found in parks under Greater Chennai Corporation. The parks that will have the facility are St Francis Park, Venkatachalam Nagar, SVT Nagar, Thendral Nagar, Vivekananda Nagar, TNHB Park in Thirumullaivoyal, Anthony Nagar, Ashok Niranjan Nagar, Paruthipattu, TNHB Avadi Park, Lazar Nagar (2nd and 5th street), Kavarapalayam, Drivers Colony, Balaji Nagar and Modern City Park.

It is difficult to understand why a section of people invariably stays away from dialogue and indulges in rumour-mongering,” he added.

He reiterated that the CAA would not take away citizenship of any Indian, but grant it to persecuted religious minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. “People who criticise the government suffer from selective amnesia,” he added.

The red meat, which is currently being served once a month, may go off the menu as authorities are having trouble procuring it from suppliers at prices agreeing with their funds. Likely to take its place are fruit and vegetable salads. Chicken is served thrice a month.

In the recently concluded state-level retreat programme to formulate new prison and correction policies, officials of the prisons department proposed changes in the menu for inmates for a healthy diet.

Speaking to TOI, DIG Prisons, coastal Andhra range, Dr Indla Sreenivasa Rao said since they were finding it difficult to procure quality mutton from vendors and suppliers. “As we are not getting suppliers who comply with norms, we have decided to approach the government for guidance. We may serve fruit and vegetable salads once a month instead of mutton,” he said. Apart from fruit, inmates will also be served boiled eggs twice a week instead of once as is being done currently. “Egg is cheap compared to any other protein-rich food,” Sreenivasa Rao said.

In what can be looked at as a solitary ray of hope, prisoners can look forward to better rice. “Recently, a representation was sent to the AP government to improve the quality of rice served in prisons in the state as inmates expressed difficulty eating the coarse rice currently being supplied,” said Director General of Prisons and Correctional Services, Andhra Pradesh Md Ahsan Reza.

The prisons department is presently buying rice from the Civil Supplies department at Rs 30 a kg.

The prisons department has listed a slew of measures for the rehabilitation of prisoners. “We have requested the AP government to list all the convicts under Aarogyasri Health Scheme so that they get quality medication,” said Ahsan Reza.

Shagun Gautam has been put at the helm after the Sunday morning churning in IPS cadre by the Yogi government.

Insiders told TOI Mishra’s transfer was not routine. He was moved out because he failed to file a chargesheet in at least 47 FIRs against Azam during his six-week tenure. Mishra’s appointment in January followed a corruption complaint against his predecessor, Ajay Pal Sharma , by then Noida SSP Vaibhav Krishna, that stirred controversy in IPS circles. An out-of-favour Mishra has been made SP, Police Headquarters, Prayagraj. Just a day before Sharma was transferred out of Rampur, the belligerent cop publicly announced on a loudspeaker in Ganj police station area, asking Azam Khan to appear in court. But the tables were turned when Santosh Mishra took over reins. He slammed brakes on any action against Azam, citing protocol in case of a serving MP and did not review pending cases.

“Two members of a family who had gone to lodge a case against the SP leader were also reprimanded and shown the door by senior police officers in Rampur,” said Faisal Lala , a social activist in Rampur.

378,['2/03/2020'],Experts find allergy-causing pollen in air,"Jaipur: Doctors have come out with a warning for those suffering with allergies as for the first time in the season, pollens of Holoptelea trees have been detected in the air. The first pollen of the season was detected in the city on Saturday. For next two months, the pollen is expected to remain in the air, taking a toll on the health of the people who are sensitive to it.

Holoptelea trees are in abundance in the city, especially in public parks including the Central Park, where hundreds of morning walkers go to every morning to get some fresh air and to keep themselves fit. The machine for pollen count installed at a private hospital in Vidyadhar Nagar detected 16 pollen of Holoptelea, signalling alarm to the patients sensitive to it. The counts represent number of pollens per cubic metre of air in 24 hours.

According to health experts, these pollens are known to cause exacerbation of symptoms in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma. However, doctors have advised that the people sensitive to these pollens should restrict their outdoor activities, especially in the mornings and evenings.

“It is seen that the peak of pollen count is in the mornings and evenings. People should not go out at these times. If it is necessary to go out for the patients sensitive to these pollens, they should wear a three-layer mask to prevent these pollens from entering the respiratory tract,” said Dr Nishtha Singh, executive director and chest consultant of a private hospital. She added that almost 10% of the asthma patients are sensitive to the Holoptelea pollen.

Despite the Holoptelea tree causing health-related problems, civic bodies are promoting its plantation. A lot many people are not aware about the ill-effects of the tree. The trees can be easily seen in public parks, Gandhi Nagar and other such areas. When people go for walks in these sarks, the pollens trigger allergy and they fall ill.

According to the SMS Hospital officials, the cases related to allergies increase during March and April.

People come complaining of runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes. Also, among asthma patients, it causes difficulty in breathing.

City-based doctors have already conducted a research — ‘Correlation of pollen counts and number of hospital visits of asthmatic and allergic rhinitis patients’, showing that there were two peaks of pollen count in a year — during March–April and August–October.

380,['2/03/2020'],Telangana governor Tamilisai Soundararajan may follow Kerala counterpart on CAA,"Tamilisai Soundararajan

HYDERABAD: With TRS opposing the Citizen (Amendment) Act ( CAA ) in Parliament and even planning to move a resolution against the law and seek modification in National Population Register ( NPR ) proforma in the assembly, the upcoming budget session is likely to be an encore of the events in Kerala. The Telangana assembly’s budget session will begin on March 6.

During the Kerala Assembly’s budget session Kerala governor Arif Mohammed Khan, in his speech, read out a paragraph against CAA. “I’m going to read this para because CM (Pinarayi Vijayan) wants me to read this, although, I hold the view this doesn’t come under the policy or programme. But CM has said this is the view of the government and to honour his wish I’m going to read this para,” the governor said before reading the para on CAA during his Assembly address.

“Our citizenship can never be on the basis of religion as this goes against the grain of secularism, which is part of the basic structure of our Constitution,” he said, referring to the resolution against CAA passed by the Kerala Assembly.

The Telangana Assembly’s budget session would begin on March 6 with governor Tamilisai Soundararajan ’s addressing the joint sitting of the House. Sources said the government would definitely incorporate its view on CAA, NPR and National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) in the governor’s address.

“The governor’s speech is being prepared and will be sent to Raj Bhavan in a couple of days. There will be mention about CAA, NRC and NPR,” highly-placed sources in the government said.

Before her appointment as Telangana governor , Tamilisai Soundararajan was president of BJP’s Tamil Nadu unit. Analysts said she might also follow her Kerala counterpart if there was anything against CAA as the governor cannot deny or modify the government-prepared speech.

Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has been critical about CAA and even the party opposed the law in the Parliament. He also announced that he would hold a public meeting or conference with likely-minded CMs of other states and party heads in Hyderabad. On a couple of occasions, he reiterated that the Telangana Assembly would pass a resolution against CAA and send it to the Centre.

TRS friendly party AIMIM has been mounting pressure on KCR to stall NPR in the state.

In the wake of riots in Delhi and CAA protests in the state, some TRS MLAs held meetings with Muslim leaders in their respective constituencies. Since the anti-CAA protests were happening in the state and MIM president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi was spearheading them, BJP’s Telangana unit has decided to hold pro-CAA meeting in Hyderabad on March 15.

Stating that his week-long yatra ‘Ppatnam ghosha’ was not aimed at wooing voters, but to know first-hand problems being faced by them, Revanth said a large number of poor families in his Malkajgiri parlimentary constituency were waiting for the TRS government to allot them 2-BHK units.

“During my Patnam Ghosha yatra, people told me they were not able to pay the ever-increasing house rents in the city. They said their travails of paying rents will end once 2-BHK units promised by CM KCR are allotted to them,” Revanth said.

He alleged contractors stopped work on the project as the government has not paid Rs 900 crore pending bills to them. “Municipal minister KT Rama Rao should answer on diversion of funds from the Centre and loans from HUDCO to other sectors. Why is KTR silent during the ongoing ‘Pattana Pragathi’ programme. There are also allegations that KCR’s relatives have sold off some of 2-BHK units in Siddipet,” Revanth alleged.

The project will be implemented in a phased manner in all 128 depots and 10 major bus stations.

The modernisation project is aimed at introducing energy efficiency measures which will ease financial burden by way of reducing consumption, said the energy department in a statement on Sunday. APSRTC is using about 30 million units of power every year and spending about Rs 28 crore for the same. The energy efficiency measures include replacing all incandescent bulbs and conventional tube lights with Light Emitting Diode (LED) lights, inefficient fans and old air conditioners with Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) star rated appliances. Replacing all old appliances not only reduce cost on power consumption but also enhance the visual appeal of the bus stations the statement said.

APSEEDCO will conduct a detailed study on energy consumption pattern across all bus stations and depots and come up with a road map of energy efficient measures suited for APSRTC.

AMARAVATI: The YSRC leadership is struggling to contain infighting in Rayalaseema districts at a time when the party is grappling with issues such as three capital cities and abolition of the legislative council. The legislators are, however, not hesitant to come out in open to lash out at their rivals within the party.

Political observers say the trend is likely to spread to new constituencies and reverse the party’s prospects in the local body elections if the YSRC leadership fails to broker peace between warring factions. The party leadership believes it has consolidated its position in the Rayalaseema region after chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy’s decision to make Kurnool the judicial capital.

Faction feuds took an ugly turn in Kurnool district when followers of Nandikotkur MLA Arthur issued an ultimatum to district in-charge minister Anil Kumar Yadav to stop encouraging rivals in the party. They warned the minister that they would not allow him to tour Kurnool district if he did not clear the names to constitute agriculture market committee as recommended by Arthur. Sources said the clout of youth leader Byreddy Siddartha Reddy is worrying the Arthur group.

386,['2/03/2020'],Six UP wetlands declared Ramsar sites this year,"Rare bird species spotted in Sandi wetland in Hardoi

LUCKNOW: The state is walking the extra mile to protect its wetlands. Six of them have been declared Ramsar sites this year and UP’s first Wetlands Authority has begun notifying wetlands lying both inside and outside forests.

A Ramsar site is a wetland designated to be of international importance under the Ramsar Convention signed in Iran in 1971.

Out of 37 wetlands declared Ramsar sites in India, now seven belong to UP. The list includes Nawabganj in Unnao, Parvati Aranga in Gonda, Saman in Mainpuri , Samaspur in Rae Bareli, Sandi in Hardoi and Sarsai Nawar in Etawah, which have made it to the list this year. The upper Ganga river, the stretch from Brigghat to Narora, is the state’s first Ramsar site, declared in 2005.

Sources in the government said while the Ramsar tag may not bring funds for conservation , but it was enough to secure international spotlight. “The declaration makes clear that six wetlands have met international scientific and technical parameters,” said a source.

The declaration comes at a time the state government has constituted UP’s first Wetlands Authority which, sources said, is still in a nascent stage. “The authority will identify and prepare a wetland atlas for the state, including the ones lying outside forest. The process to notify Ramgarh Taal has started. It lies outside forest,” a source said.

UP has around 1.2 lakh wetlands that lie outside forests and around 500 that lie within. According to the national wetland atlas that is based on satellite data, out of the 1.2 lakh in UP at least 23,800 are more than 2.2 hectare in area and need conservation. However, going by revenue records, UP has at least 26,000 wetlands that are bigger than 2.2 hectare.

Once the wetlands are notified, they will be covered under the Wildlife Protection Act. Conservation efforts will also involve developing a connect between people and wetlands such as promoting eco-tourism, fisheries and other economic activities.

Wetlands are shallow water bodies spread over an area of at least 3 hectare or those with water as deep as 30cm for a period of six months. It is the changing land-use pattern that is the biggest threat to wetlands.

CHENNAI: Jawaharlal Nehru University vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar has been nominated to the panel to search for a new vice-chancellor for University of Madras by governor Banwarilal Purohit, who is its chancellor. Sources from the university confirmed the nomination and said he would be the convenor of the search panel.

The nomination has surprised the university faculty since professor Jagadesh Kumar’s tenure at JNU has been mired in controversies. They also said the professor should not be given the task of short-listing a new vice-chancellor for Madras University since he has an engineering background.

A senior professor from the university, who did not want his name revealed, urged the governor to nominate a person with non-controversial background and some understanding of issues pertaining to Madras University. “Ever since his appointment as vice-chancellor of JNU, students have been protesting against decisions taken by his administration. He even refused to meet student representatives following an attack by hooligans on students inside the campus. He is also known to be close to the ruling party at the Centre. If that’s the case, how can we expect a neutral person to be nominated as VC,” he asked.

Another professor argued that the state has enough academicians and there was no need to bring an academician from Delhi to select the vice-chancellor for a state university.

Professor Jagadesh Kumar did his post-graduation and PhD at IIT Madras and worked in IIT Delhi before taking over as vice-chancellor of JNU in 2016.

P Maruthamuthu, former vice-chancellor of Madurai Kamaraj University, and P Ramasamy, former vice-chancellor of Alagappa University, have been nominated as senate and syndicate nominees to the panel.

After a government order, the three-member panel will call for applications from eligible candidates for vice-chancellor post, sources said. The three-year tenure of present vice-chancellor of University of Madras, P Duraisamy, will end in May.

During a meeting with special police officers (retired defence personnel), police officials and mining officials on Saturday, J Ram Mohan Rao, officer on special duty (OSD), Vizianagaram, said 14 vehicles were seized for illegally transporting sand in the district in the last two months.

The OSD said sand from various reaches in the district was taken illegally to other states for construction purposes and added there must a be a stricter monitoring to curb the practice.

The OSD said demand for sand in other states has made reaches in Vizianagaram highly vulnerable because of its proximity to Orissa. He said at a time when vast projects are mooted in the state, there should be no shortage of sand in the district.

The OSD said three more reaches were identified in the district at Mettavalasa, Denkada and Peddatadivada. The OSD said the eight checkposts in the district are located at key points across the porous border and would be manned by the police and mining officials.

He said two mobile teams and those manning the check posts would be given special smart phones with the apvigilance3 app, which would help identify the vehicles transporting sand illegally. He said CCTV cameras would be installed in certain target reaches.

Police identified the deceased as G Chinnapayan alias Muniyappa, son of Govindappa, from a village near Dhenkanikottai. While 20 bull tamers were injured, two bulls died as they rammed into each other during the event.

The event was organized as part of the three-day annual festival at the Mallikarjuneswarar temple at Mallikarujunamalai. According to police, a large number of people from across the district, particularly from the villages surrounding Mallikarjunamalai, usually turn up for the annual temple festival.

On Sunday too, there was a huge crowd to watch the bull taming sport. One of the bulls barged into the area where spectators had gathered as it ran out of the arena. Police said Chinnapayyan, who was caught unawares, couldn’t flee and was knocked down by the bull. He suffered grievous injuries and died on the spot.

Unlike jallikattu, the arena for ‘eruthu vidum vizha’ would be a bigger one, usually an agricultural field. Hence, the barricades were erected only for a portion, primarily around the starting point, where the bulls would be let loose, though there would be spectators all around the field. Police said all precautionary measures were taken, yet the bulls managed to enter the gallery.

Meanwhile, a bull, which was in the arena even after the next bull was let loose, was rammed head on by the latter. Both the bulls collapsed on the ground and died shortly afterwards.

The Centre, in association with World Bank, plan to fund state governments for purchase of new buses as part of a broader plan to reduce air and noise pollution caused by personal vehicles.

TSRTC might have to replace over 8,000 buses in the next five years. It requires over Rs 2,500 crore to replace the existing fleet of buses, which outlive its utility.

As on date, TSRTC is operating over 10,000 buses of which 8000-odd were its own buses and over 2,000 hired buses. Of them, over 6600 were being operating from the city to various destinations across the state and intra-state, from one district to another, including over 300 air-conditioned buses, 2,500 non-AC buses and 3,784 Palle Velugu buses.

In the city, the state-owned public transporter operates over 3,800 buses, including 180 air-conditioned buses (40 electric ones) and the rest ,3,650 non-AC buses. RTC buses transport 95 lakh passengers daily, logging over 35 lakh km. The RTC’s accumulated losses were nearly Rs 5,000 crore.

In such a situation, the new buses offer from the Central government could not have come at a better time for the Road Transport Corporation. TSRTC officials had attended the first round of meeting with the Central government officials in Delhi.

TSRTC officials told TOI that the Centre was still working out modalities and that a final picture on funding would emerge in a month or two. Sources said the Centre was encouraging privatization of public transport as part of its scheme to fund new buses.

Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, who had proposed privatisation of some routes where TSRTC was presently operating, might give the nod to the TSRTC officials to avail the central scheme when they go for the second round of meeting with officials of the Union road transport and highways ministry.

However, the session also saw a mellowed Yogi who went an extra mile to mingle with partymen and rivals with equal ease.

On the last day of the session, when finance minister wanted to host a lunch for MLAs, the chief minister offered that not only he would host it himself, but also share a meal with legislators. The occasion saw him spending a good time and striking animated conversations with MLAs.

While earlier, Yogi has been making a front attack against the opposition, even ‘threatening to send them to jail’, in this session he remarked once that a film should be made on the life of the leader of opposition, Ram Govind Chaudhary . “It will become a huge hit,” he said.

When the opposition MLAs had masked their faces on last day of the session accusing the government of denying them from speaking, Yogi did not attack them, but was just laughing and avoided the confrontation by saying “the masks would keep them away from pollution”.

During his speech also, the chief minister thanked the Congress legislature party leader Aradhana Mishra for appreciating the budge. Not only this, whenever Yogi would reach the house, he would make it a point to greet the leaders of opposition parties by walking up to the desk of the leader of opposition and meeting him with folded hands.

Besides, when the opposition leaders led by BSP’s Uma Shankar Singh and Congress’s Aradhna Mishra demanded an increase in MLAs’ local area development fund,Yogi didn’t lose much time in hiking the fund from Rs 2 crore to Rs 3 crore. He also hinted at increasing the salaries of MLAs.

This was quite different from the budget session in 2017, when the entire oppostion boycotted the session alleging threat from the treasury benches and the CM’s aggressive words.

Such was the deadlock that for the whole budget session, the opposition conducted ‘parallel house’ outside the assembly, and elected its own ‘leader of the house’.

The confrontation continued between the government and the Opposition till 2019 deepening the battle lines.

This time, though Yogi retained aggressive posture, he mixed it with a more accommodating approach, inviting the opposition for dialogue and discussion. No wonder, the session passed without much hiccups.

NEW DELHI: Central Board of Secondary Education has said that if there are any students in the riot-affected areas who cannot appear for the board exam until March 7, their exams will be held at a later date. The school principals and the directorate of education (DoE) has been asked to provide details of such students.

From Monday, CBSE class X and XII examinations will take place as scheduled all over the city. The exams in the northeast and some parts of east Delhi were postponed earlier due to the violence.

Issuing a statement, CBSE secretary Anurag Tripathi said, “CBSE will hold the examinations of both classes X and XII in the northeast district of Delhi from March 2 as per the schedule given in the date sheet. At the same time, considering the difficult situation that continues with some of the candidates, CBSE is prepared to hold examinations at a later date for such candidates who would not be able to appear for the examinations up to March 7. The school principals have been requested to provide the list of such students to the board. DoE has also been requested by CBSE to provide a list.”

The examination will be held amid security in and around the centres. The board said it has decided to go on with the examinations so that it does not hamper the chances of admissions in professional courses i.e. medical, engineering, law and other UG admissions.

“Few entrance examinations are conducted in accordance with the timelines fixed by the courts and therefore, dates are sacrosanct. Similarly, JEE (Main) is also scheduled from April 3 to 19. The board is also clear that for candidates who are in a position to appear for the board examinations, it would be very stressful and cause immense anxiety if the examinations are further postponed. As per our ongoing consultations with Delhi Police, the exams can be held smoothly and safely now for those students who are in a position to appear for them,” said Tripathi.

HYDERABAD: Terming the riots in north-east Delhi as genocide, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Sunday demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should speak up on the violence where several people lost their lives. He also questioned the silence maintained by other NDA leaders.

The violence had started small, as clashes between supporters and opponents of the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act.

“I want to ask the PM why he hasn’t spoken a single word on the Delhi violence that took place just a few kilometres away from his official residence. More than 40 people lost their lives in the violence. He should speak up and visit the riot-hit Shiv Vihar as people who died are all Indians,” Owaisi said at a public meeting held as part of the party’s 62nd foundation day at Darussalam

The AIMIM chief said that though the PM mentioned ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ at his Saturday meet in Uttar Pradesh, he did not mention the riots even once. He also accused the Delhi police of not responding to calls my Muslims affected by the violence.

Referring to the slogans raised at a Metro railway station in Delhi, Owaisi said, “Who are these people shouting goli maaro desh ke gaddaron ko (shoot the traitors). This is planned violence.”

Meanwhile, AIMIM leaders have decided to donate one month salary to the families of those killed in Delhi violence.

Owaisi said that his party would also urge CM K Chandrasekhar Rao not to allow the National Population Register to be taken up in the state.

The organisers, Automobile Association of Eastern India , have set up an “inquiry” into the incident. Armed with the required visa the rallyists crossed the Petrapole border on Sunday morning, only to be stopped at the Bangladesh end and told to return. Upset rallyists said they were told to return because of some “security issues” and “for lack of permission”. Nothing, however, was given in writing. The rally was supposed to move from Dhaka to Cox ’s Bazar, Chittagong, Mymensingh and Narayanganj, and re-enter Bengal at Siliguri, reports Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey.

Bangladesh deputy high commissioner in Kolkata, Toufique Hasan, told TOI via WhatsApp that while the intention of the rally was good, visas are given only for entry but a rally of this magnitude requires several other permissions from various Bangladeshi authorities.

402,['2/03/2020'],"Now, Maharashtra govt may reverse cow protection scheme","Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray

MUMBAI: The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is likely to reverse yet another decision taken by its predecessor: the cattle-protection scheme Govardhan Govansh Seva Kendra (GGSK) launched by the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP-Sena alliance after a beef ban came into effect in the state. The scheme intended to boost infrastructure at cow sheds (gaushalas) was especially set up to conserve, protect and develop cattle and progeny.

Dairy and animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar told TOI the current government will review the scheme. “We have not reached any conclusion yet. The department has been asked to review the scheme and prepare a report on how much funds have been spent, the impact of the scheme and other details,” said Kedar. A senior official said GGSK funds may not be released from now on as neither Congress nor NCP—constituents of MVA, along with Shiv Sena—is interested in going ahead with the scheme. A minister said the Uddhav Thackeray-led government is not in a mood to continue with the scheme also because most gaushala functionaries are linked to RSS.

The Fadnavis government had in 2015 enforced a beef ban, making sale or consumption of beef punishable by a five-year jail term and a fine of Rs 10,000.The GGSK scheme was launched in 2017 to set up permanent shelters in 34 districts for aged cattle which had stopped yielding milk to ensure they were not abandoned.

In 2018-19, the financial year when the scheme kicked in, the state made a one-time allocation of Rs 1 crore per gaushala, excluding Mumbai and its suburbs. In the next fiscal, the scope of the scheme was expanded to the taluka level, but with the same overall budgetary provision. Thus, it was decided to distribute Rs 34 crore among 140-plus talukas, with a grant of roughly Rs 25 lakh per gaushala.

An official said the GGSK scheme is beset with problems. On the one hand, farmers can no longer sell old and sick cattle, while on the other, the upkeep of these animals is proving to be a strain on a debt-ridden state. The scheme was intended at looking after unproductive cattle which farmers could no longer afford to feed and so would abandon or send to slaughter houses, especially during drought-like situations. At present, there are 518 gaushalas across the state, where 72,000 animals are being taken care of by various “non-profit organizations”.

As part of a previous cattle protection scheme, the government in 2016 had decided to audit over 1,200 fodder camps set up in different parts of the state during 2012-2014, and on which the government had spent about Rs 800 crore. In 2015-16 alone, the state spent Rs 185 crore on these fodder camps. The government gives a grant of Rs 70 for a big animal and Rs 35 for a small animal in the camps.

NEW DELHI: Security around the anti-CAA protest site at Shaheen Bagh was heightened on Sunday after a protest call by Hindu Sena to clear the road. Even though the right-wing group cancelled its plan for the gathering on Saturday evening, Delhi Police imposed Section 144 in the area to prevent any untoward incident.

On Saturday, Vishnu Gupta, president of Hindu Sena, said: “This is to inform the general public that we have decided to call off the gathering for the protest site clearance in view of the ongoing law and order situation. I request you to not reach Shaheen Bagh (sic),” Gupta said.

“Last time as well, Hindu Sena had called for a protest for the same reason and despite it being called off, a number of people had reached close to the protest site and shouted slogans. We did not want any form of gathering, which is why Section 144 was imposed. We want to maintain law and order in the area,” a senior police officer told TOI.

Hindu Sena on Friday had called for a gathering to clear the Shaheen Bagh protest site, stating that Delhi Police and courts had not been able to do so. “On March 1, we will clear the roads ourselves. Shaheen Bagh protests are nothing, but a deliberate attempt to encourage and abet riots across the country, derail the economy and defame India on the global platform,” Gupta had claimed.

The protest at Shaheen Bagh has been going on for over two months now and people have complained of traffic bottlenecks.

405,['2/03/2020'],"Corporation relays 100 roads, work on 270 others underway","Chennai: Various roads across the city, including bus route and interior roads , are being re-laid by Greater Chennai Corporation . Officials said work on around 100 roads has been completed, while work is underway in around 270 roads.

Data sourced from the civic body shows that work on 39 bus route roads has been completed, while in around 39, work is underway. Work on another 106 roads will begin soon. In all, Rs 44 crore will be spent on this in the 2019-20 financial year.

Major roads that have been re-laid completely are Ethiraj Sami Salai and Meenambal Salai in north Chennai and Habibullah Road, St Mary’s Road, Usman Road flyover and New Avadi Road in central Chennai.

As far as interior roads are concerned, work on 60 roads has been completed, while work on 140 roads is underway. Work on another 750 roads will be taken up soon. The expenditure for interior roads is around Rs 150 crore for the 2019-20 financial year. Some interior roads that received a face-lift include Arul Nagar Second Street, Ganapathy Nagar Third Street, Kannadasan Street, Bharathiyar Street and Annaswamy Street in the north and central parts. Work on some bus route and interior roads pending from the previous financial year is also underway, an official said.

In light of the Madras high court taking up road milling in a serious manner, corporation officials said they are scrutinising work done by contractors properly. “Only those contractors who have a sensor-driven milling machine costing Rs 2 crore were allowed to relay the roads. Either they should buy the machines or show proof of lease agreements,” a senior official said. Around 25 contractors own the machine in the city.

Milling is important as otherwise, road height would increase and consequently impact the level of houses. Spot visits show that after the high court stricture, milling on roads in Mandaveli has improved. This could be gauged as the road below the level of the manhole was also found to be milled, while before the HC stricture, this was not done.

Activist Jayaram Venkatesan of NGO Arappor Iyakkam said milling work this time is better than in previous years. “However, there are still complaints in some areas,” he said.

C R Balaji of Mandaveli who travels across the city regularly, said the milling work is not uniform in different areas. “For instance, proper milling work could be seen on St Mary’s Road, but behind the Aavin roundabout in Adyar, the work wasn’t as good. It depends on how ward area engineers supervise the work or how much accountability is demanded by their bosses,” he said.

NEW DELHI: A module supplying party drugs to students and businessmen was busted and two smugglers were arrested a few days ago. Drugs worth Rs 50 crore were seized from them.

Police said the father of one of the accused, Puneet Arora (42) who belongs to Gurugram, runs a medicine shop in Birmingham. He is allegedly the kingpin of the racket.

The Delhi operations were handled by Arora, they added. The other accused, Vinod Kumar ( 44), is a resident of Uttam Nagar.

“We have seized around 69 kg of capsules and 150 kg of tablets of Tramadol. 12.5 kg of Alprazolam tablets were also found with them,” DCP (special cell) Sanjeev Yadav said.

The police got information that the accused used to procure psychotropic drugs from various parts of India and supplied them to Delhi and the UK. “A specific input was received that a large consignment of the contraband was going to be exchanged between Arora and Kumar in Uttam Nagar, after which a team led by ACP Sanjay Dutt laid a trap, and arrested them,” DCP Yadav said.

Arora revealed that his father was running a medicine shop in the UK and supplied psychotropic drug tablets and capsules in the garb of Ayurvedic products. “These drugs were supplied by the father-son duo to pubs and nightclubs. A contact, named as X, was fixed to deliver these drugs. We are looking for that contact,” DCP Yadav added.

Kumar used to work as a courier boy and allegedly knew some clearing agents in customs department who helped him in shipping these consignments out of India.

Upon intensive search of the vehicles and questioning of the people, a huge quantity of marijuana was found in a secret cavity behind the driver’s cabin of the truck. The main supplier and the receiver, along with their accomplices, were placed under arrest.

During interrogation, it was revealed that the source was located in Ganjam district of Odisha. Though the district has been removed from the list of Naxalites-affected areas in 2018 by Odisha police, the sleuths will now probe if some Naxal-linked groups were behind this cartel. There are some leads in this regard, sources said.

“There is a big margin in the smuggling of marijuana. The contraband was sold by the source at Rs 2,500 per kg and the end user paid Rs 500 for ten grams. The marijuana was compressed and packed in square shapes so that a large amount could be shipped in a single consignment,” said an officer.

In India, cannabis is grown in large scale in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. According to police, ganja is grown illegally on vast stretches of Odisha’s inaccessible forested regions and make for the largest produce in the country. “While the state’s climatic condition favours the production, the growth is further aided by barren Maoist-affected hilly terrains as well as prevalent poverty,” an official said. Sources said that districts like Boudh, Gajapati Rayagada, Kandhamal, Malkangiri and Sambalpur have been identified as major production hubs in Odisha.

412,['2/03/2020'],"It pays to manage waste, find 9 south Mumbai societies","For the first time, a private firm will handle all the dry waste in D ward

MUMBAI: If people don’t turn up their noses, garbage may not be all that smelly. Starting this month, nine housing societies in south Mumbai ’s D Ward will qualify for a 10% property tax rebate—5% for properly segregating their wet and dry waste and 5% for composting the wet garbage on their premises.

The incentive is part of the ongoing initiatives to send zero garbage to Mumbai’s overflowing landfills which are hazardous and combustible. Over the last two years, most societies and bulk waste generators like restaurants have changed their approach to garbage and realised that they must now share the onus of waste disposal with the civic body, in keeping with a 2016 Central government notification that requires people to segregate waste at source.

“We are finding that many societies already doing a great job of taking care of their wet waste on their premises, including Godrej Baug, Infinity Towers, Hill Park and Navrang,” says Rajendra Jagtap, who oversees solid waste management in D ward. “Bulk generators like Malabar Hill Club and Willingdon Sports Club also take care of their own kitchen waste. Even Mahalaxmi and Babulnath Temple and ISKCON have installed machines that compost their floral waste.”

For the first time, a private company has been appointed to take charge of all dry garbage, starting in D Ward because the NGO model has not been consistent. From March 1, Dalmia Polypro, an upcycler that converts plastic waste into film, yarn, furniture and other products, will handle the entire chain of collecting, segregating, recycling and transporting dry waste. It will start first with Nepean Sea Road, Walkeshwar Road and Malabar Hill and gradually move to other areas in the ward. The company has been allotted space in Worli for its upcycling work.

Ragpickers help in waste segregation, to be trained in cleaning up dry plastic

Dalmia Polypro, a plastic upcycling firm, has been given space at Khadye Marg, opposite Mahalaxmi Race Course, where its machines now pack the plastic into tight bales and also neatly divide it into the various grades which can then be sent to be regurgitated into its new avatars.

“PET bottles yield fibre yarn which is used to make clothes, blankets and shoes; fast food packaging becomes fuel or can be used to make agricultural pipes, the hub for which is in Malegaon,” says Shashikant Joshi of Dalmia Polypro. “The multilayer plastic used in packaging has no real value, which is why you can see it lying everywhere, on streets or clogging drains. Now we will handle it and ensure th at it is transported to the cement factories where it is used in place of carbon fuel.”

The vast informal recycling army of ragpickers are being given identity cards and uniforms and continue to participate in the segregation process. There are around 85 ragpickers across D ward, says Jagtap. They will also be trained to clean up the dry plastic that still contain bits of wet food or milk. If this pilot project works, it will be replicated across the city. As for wet waste, all housing societies, restaurants and other generators will eventually have to handle this at source, either by composting on the premises or handing the job over to a contractor.

So far, D ward office has received 14 applications for the rebate. “We have found 9 to be in order and the rest are still being scrutinised,” says Jagtap. The rebate will be effective from April onwards, in the general assessment category of property tax.

Waste management systems in the city has long followed a haphazard system where wet and dry waste collectively found its way into the overflowing landfills in Deonar and Kanjurmarg, leading to periodic combustion caused by compressed gasses. Even after some housing societies started following segregating practices, there has been no proper audit of whether the wet waste was actually being composted by the contractors, or whether it was being illegally dumped in random open spaces. Now both the municipal corporation and citizens are getting closer to realising that this is in every one’s best interest.

413,['2/03/2020'],Madras HC stays transfer of complaints against lawyers to Bar Council of India,"Chennai: The Madras high court has stayed transfer of disciplinary complaints against advocates pending before the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry to the Bar Council of India (BCI) on the ground that the former has failed to dispose the complaints within one year. A division bench of Justices N Kirubakaran and R Pongiappan passed the interim order while noting that the state bar council is deliberately dragging the disposal so that the complaints are transferred to BCI under Section 36B of the Advocates Act.

“It is evident from many cases listed before this court that the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry is not exercising its statutory duty and disposing the complaint within the stipulated period of one year. There is every reason to believe that it is being done deliberately to ensure that Section 36B could be invoked and the complaints could be transferred to BCI,” the bench said.

This apart, parties who are already under distress would be put to unnecessary hardship as they would be forced to go to New Delhi which is 2,200 km from Chennai to pursue the complaints, and it would be impossible for the poor litigants. They would be put to untold hardship and grave injustice would be caused to them, the bench added.The court passed the order on a plea moved by a complainant whose plaint against an advocate was dragged for years before the state bar. Now apprehending that the complaint would be transferred to the BCI under Section 36B, he approached the high court.

Allowing the plea, the bench said, Section 36B was brought only in the interest of the aggrieved litigants and also to see that erring advocates are punished at the earliest. However, the bar councils of the respective states are taking advantage of the provision and doing injustice to the complainants by transferring their complaints to the file of BCI deliberately. Thus, the very purpose of the provision is frustrated.

Further, noting that the validity of the provision needs to be examined, the court impleaded the central government as party respondent to the plea and adjourned it to March 6 for further hearing.

415,['2/03/2020'],Rs 1-crore fraud lens on institute staffer from Kolkata,"Representative image

By: Tanmaya Das

KOLKATA: A city-based academic institute has alleged misappropriation of funds to the tune of over Rs 1 crore by a senior member of its finance and accounts department. The complaint was registered with the Bhowanipore police.

Police has initiated an investigation against the accused, Santanu Bag, under sections 408 (criminal breach of trust), 403 (dishonest misappropriation of property), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using forged documents as genuine) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property). Bag has been summoned for questioning.

According to the FIR by Global Reach Education Foundation, Bag allegedly embezzled the money meant for the payment of employees’ state insurance and employees’ provident fund. The embezzlement was accounted for Rs1,02,39,305.

Bag had some key responsibilities that included salary payments, regulatory government deposits, vendor payments against claims etc.

The embezzlement was carried out from January 2018 till December, 2019. Bag had been receiving money since April 2016 for the payment of several expenses that he had misappropriated. Based on the revelations of an audit, Bag was asked to cooperate with the emergency internal compliance committee on February 10, 2020, for the inquiry. But his alleged “lack of willingness to cooperate in the committee proceedings resulted in his suspension from the role”.

However, due to lack of response, the final showcause notice was issued on Feb 24, 2020, seeking a probe on the irregularities kept in bookkeeping and the personal bank account statements of Bag. According to the audit report, there has been some irregularity in the filing of GST returns as well. This has resulted in the additional burden of interest and penalty for the institute.

According to the complaint filed by the managing director of the institute Ravi Lochan Singh, he was requested by Bag on December 27, 2019, to approve a hefty amount and transfer the fund online in order to pay for the various expenses of the institute. Singh, who lives outside India, trusted him and transferred the money. However, an investigation revealed a huge difference between the amount paid to Bag and the sum disbursed for ESI and EPF. This prompted the institute to conduct a deeper probe.

This is the second such order issued by the Kolkata FRRO in recent days.

JU sources said the notice was issued to Kamil Siedcynski on February 22. Kamil has been told that his con-duct was “inappropriate for a foreign national staying in India on a student visa”.

A concerned Kamil has informed the embassy of Poland and appealed to the FRRO to reconsider the notice, saying that he had merely gone to click photographs, which “should not be construed as participating in the rally”. He has appealed that he be allowed to stay in India till July to complete his coursework. He was otherwise scheduled to leave India in August.

The first such order by the Kolkata FRRO was issued on February 14 to a Bangladeshi undergraduate student of Visva-Bharati University after the student, Afsara Anika Meem , posted photographs of an anti-CAA pro-test on social media.

418,['2/03/2020'],"Mumbai: Ditched by hubby, single mom now runs for living","Marathoner Seema Verma won over Rs 2 lakh last year

MUMBAI: Nalasopara resident Seema Verma has made it to the winners’ podium at many running events over the last few years, but it’s her personal story of grit that inspires fellow-runners the most.

Verma, a 38-year-old single mother who survived an abusive marriage, worked as a domestic help before one of the ‘memsahibs’ helped her take up running professionally.

Today, Verma—mother of a 19-yearold boy—makes a living only out of running. While she refuses to reveal how much she earns, she said, “When I finish on the podium, I get something like Rs 20,000. Collectively, these earning help me survive.”

Considering that Verma finished on the podium in 14 of the races she ran through 2019, it would be safe to assume she made over Rs 2 lakh—considerably more than a domestic help would make in a year.

She isn’t yet an elite marathoner—a title that requires women to complete the 42-km run in roughly 3:05 hours-—but she finished on the podium of the Tata Mumbai Marathon held in January with a timing of 3:52:58 hours.

Running, though considered a nascent sport in India, is estimated to be a $200 million business. The tribe of local elite marathoners is thus slowly but surely growing. In the West, winning races offers rich dividends: most marathons offer special prices for runners who finish the run in specific period (say a $1,000 for finishing under 2:11 hours for men and 2:28 for women) and the winner earn tens of thousands dollars. The first-place runner at the London Marathon, for instance, gets over $50,000.

8 years after starting as runner, she made a mark

Verma lived in Kolkata before moving to Mumbai at eight years of age. She was married at 17 years of age to an alcoholic who deserted her and their son within four years of their wedding. Forced to fend for herself and her toddler, Seema took up odd jobs, including being a househelp. There were days when she had to lock up her son at home so that she could go to work.

One of Verma’s employers, who knew about her love for sports, exhorted her to take up running to supplement her income. It was also the time when Verma was learning karate. Her parents were not encouraging as they wanted her to concentrate on getting a job and raising her son. Under the circumstances, it wasn’t easy for her to spare time to train for a marathon but she slowly over the next couple of years got better at running.

Now, eight years after starting her journey as a runner, Verma has crossed a personal landmark: she only depends on her passion of running to survive.

Nagpur: Growth is the most important indicator of a child’s health. It depends on various factors, right from food, physical activity, lifestyle and environment. The Indian Academy of Paediatricians (IAP) has prepared growth charts precisely for Indian children. These charts are available free of cost for parents to measure the height and weight of their children in the age group of 5 to 18 years.

Instead of following the growth charts of USA, UK and other countries, Indian parents should follow the IAP’s latest revised growth chart, appealed renowned paediatrician, Dr Vaman Khadilkar, who was the convener of the growth chart committee of IAP.

“Parents can track the growth of their kids simply by downloading the free android app ‘IAP growth chart’. This app will clear many myths about growth,” he said.

Dr Khadilkar was in the city to attend ‘Paediatric Endocrine Update’, a one-day conference organized by the Academy of Paediatricians (AOP) Nagpur. The conference mainly focused on hormonal issues in children.

“One of the major myths is that children don’t have issues related to hormones. The endocrine system is considered as one of the most primitive body systems. Complexities in this system impact growth, development, survival and reproduction,” he said.

Dr Sudha Rao (Mumbai), Dr IPS Kochar (Delhi), Dr Saurabh Uppal (Jalandhar), Dr Swati Kanodia (Delhi) and Dr Ruchi Parikh (Mumbai) shared the latest developments in bone health, rickets, endocrine hypertension and type 1 diabetes. City’s paediatric endocrinologist, Dr Hari Mangtani, spoke about the approach to children with rickets. Dr Anuradha Khadilkar shared her knowledge about obesity and metabolic syndrome.

“Obesity is responsible for many hormonal diseases in children and adolescents, right from thyroid disorders to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). A healthy lifestyle and proper diet can keep children fit. Reducing screen time is also an important factor. These lifestyle changes need to be followed by all the family members and not just kids,” she said.

AOP Nagpur president, Dr Shubhada Khirwadkar and secretary Dr Mustafa Ali said that these days, paediatricians are better equipped to treat children and adolescents with hormonal disorders.

“Paediatric endocrinology is a specialized branch for hormonal diseases in children. This super-speciality has developed rapidly in the world and India as well in the last few years. Doctors from all over Vidarbha were given the latest update about endocrinology in today’s event,” said Dr Khirwadkar.

The parents can admit their wards to nursery, junior preparatory, kindergarten or to Class I under the Act. A student, once admitted, can stay in the school under the RTE provision until he completes Class VIII.

The deadline for submitting the online application forms was on Saturday. As many as 16,311 applications were received from parents who are keen on their wards to get admitted in schools under RTE. The number of applications has increased by about 3,000 as compared to last year.

Sources in the zilla parishad said it would be difficult to get admissions under RTE than last year as the number of seats available has dipped this year as compared to last year. This year, there are 5,553 seats up for grabs, while last year, there were 5,735 vacant seats.

“The number of schools that had registered last year was 457. This year, only 447 schools have registered. This will impact the availability of seats,” ZP education officials said.

After receiving the applications, there will be a verification of the documents by the scrutiny committee on the basis of which the applications will be eligible for the lottery round.

The government has taken two initiatives in the admission process of students under RTE this year. It has scrapped the system of having lottery four times for selection of students. Instead, the draw of lots would be done only once.

Also, the same number of students will be put on the waiting list.

“The students sometimes give wrong information, which causes rejection of their applications. Also the students want to take admissions in the schools of their preference in their locality which, if not allotted, they do not take admission under RTE and go to another school,” the officials added.

“By April 13, the list of the students will be finalised after the lottery and the verification of the documents would take place thereafter. After that, a waiting list of the applicants will be released,” the officials added.

But only a few had known that it was one among the several elephant sculptures he and his two friends, Vipin Raj and Abin M R, had sculpted over the last seven years. For them sculpting lifelike statues of Kerala’s renowned tuskers is a livelihood and more than 200 such sculptures of tuskers like Pambadi Rajan, Thechikottukavu Ramachandran and Thrikkadavoor Sivaraju, have been made in their workshop named ‘ Aana Factory ’ in Chakkumarassery in Paravur .

“We are passionate about elephants since childhood but we knew that we couldn’t afford to own one. Then it was my cousin and Guru Vipin Raj, who put forward the idea of making our own versions of these tuskers with the skills we had. He started experimenting with elephant sculpting 10 years ago and later Abin and I joined him. Our sculpture won appreciation and people started making orders for more sculptures,” said Abhisankar, who is currently working on the statue of Guruvayur Padmanabhan, the tusker that died recently.

The heights of their sculptures range between 1.5ft and 5.5ft. It took one and a half week to complete the 1.5ft-tall piece of Sivasundar and for the larger ones it will take up to a month.

“Based on the order we will take photographs of the particular elephant from different angles. The carvings, detailing and painting are all done by hand. While the smallest one costs Rs 20,000, the 5.5ft-tall Pambadi Rajan’s sculpture was sold for nearly Rs 2 lakhs,” Abhisankar said.

Nagpur: Instigated by local leaders, villagers of Dhiwarwada near Koka Wildlife Sanctuary, 70km from here in Bhandara district, created ruckus over death of a farmer who died due to drowning but people wanted it to be considered as victim of wild animal attack. As per the GR, kin of the victim of wild animal attacks get Rs15 lakh.

On February 28, Harishchandra Raut (52), Dhiwarwada, went missing when he had gone to his farm for guarding crop, known as ‘jagli’ in local parlance. Raut’s farm is adjacent to the sanctuary and is separated by a perennial small brook.

When Raut did not return home, his wife approached the villagers who launched a search on February 29. His body was found in the nullah, which had hardly 2-3 feet water.

News of Raut’s death spread like wild fire and a mob of around 200 people gathered at the spot. They were joined by some politicians including former BJP MLA Charan Waghmare from Tumsar, Dhiwarwada sarpanch Dhamdeo Wanve and others.

When forest officials and police reached the spot, villagers led by zilla parishad member Sarita Chouragade and Wanve did not allow them to remove Raut’s body and wanted officials to put on record that his death was due to wild animal attack and his family be paid compensation as per GR.

The mob vent ire on Koka RFO Sachin Jadhav, who had arrested Raut in April last for poaching a wild boar. Raut was among 11 accused arrested. The case is pending in Mohadi court. The mob also alleged that Raut was frustrated with the court case and hence must have committed suicide.

However, as the mob let loose arousing law and order problem, the leaders forced forest and police officials to announce some compensation to the victim’s family. On humanitarian ground, RFO Jadhav gave Rs15,000 while API Nilesh Waje offered Rs10,000 from their pockets.

The people did not stop at this and put Raut’s body in front of forest quarters at Dhiwarwada and forced the RFO to give it in writing that the victim would be paid compensation as per the GR.

Ex-MLA Waghmare said, “Raut’s farm is close to sanctuary boundary and he died due to falling in the nullah after being chased by wild animals. He should get Rs15 lakh compensation as per GR. The fact has been recorded in police panchnama. Post-mortem report will reveal it.”

Sarpanch Wanve said, “It is not confirmed how Raut died. Though Raut’s body showed no major injuries, the area has presence of tigers and leopards. There is no reason why he will commit suicide. Post-mortem report will reveal the truth.”

However, police officials who were on the spot, told TOI, “Prima facie, it appears to be a case of accidental death. We examined the body but nowhere injury marks were seen. There are no eyewitnesses to testify that Raut was attacked by wild animals. We are waiting for post-mortem report.”

NNTR officials said, “Entire area near the spot was scanned but there is no direct or indirect evidence like pugmarks, scrape marks, or scat of any wild animal. Paying compensation in such cases will set wrong precedent.”

425,['2/03/2020'],Top decision: HC to have stack parking,"Chandigarh: The UT has finalized the modalities of its first stack parking (one on top of the other) system for 2,800 cars (extendable to 5,000) at the Punjab and Haryana high court and started the financial exercise.

The project site is opposite the court building in an open area where the bar association is running a temporary paid parking. The work will cost the city around Rs 300 crore for now, but procedural delays might jack up the expenses during construction. The financial estimate for special grant will go to the home ministry because the UT administrator has powers to sanction only up to Rs 100 crore.

The three-tier basement parking will cover 14.75 acres, although the building’s footprint will be just 9.5 acres. The total basement area will be 11.55 lakh square feet, while its each single floor will cover 3.85 lakh square feet. The court is part of Unesco world heritage site Capitol Complex, an eco-sensitive zone. After building the three-floor basement parking, the surface area will be maintained green, but it’s unclear, so far, how Unesco and its related heritage agencies will see it.

A senior officer in the Chandigarh administration said: “We are on with preparing the financial estimate, keeping in mind all the parameters such as structural and fire safety, besides the use of latest technology. All things have been taken care of in making the financial estimate. Since it will be a huge building with electricity sub-station, lifts, automated entry and exit, it will have fire-safety equipment, proper ventilation, lighting, and ramps, besides intelligent parking systems such as boom barriers and electronic screens that show space availability.

Complainant Dilip Mali, who retired from Vadodara Gas Ltd, had approached accused Manjit Rajput and Geeta Rajput as he wanted to buy their property located near Somatalav in 2017. Mali and the couple decided to fix the property’s deal at Rs13 lakh and Mali paid Rs1 lakh cash immediately and then paid Rs2 lakh through cheque.

For the remaining amount, Mali wanted to take out a loan from a bank, but his loan requests were turned down by several banks as he was retired. Mali then went to the couple to inform that he was not getting a loan so he would like to call off the deal and asked for his token amount back. Manjit told Mali that it was too late, so the money cannot be returned. Mali’s nephew too talked to the couple for the money, but they gave same excuse to him too.

Later, Mali learned that the couple had already sold the property to some other person without returning him his money. He recently approached police to register his complaint at Wadi police station on Saturday. Police said Mali was suffering from heart ailment for which he had to undergo surgery and advised to not venture out of home for eight months, thus the delay in registering the case.

435,['2/03/2020'],Encroachments and illegal buildings ignore GVMC fiat,"Visakhapatnam: In order to make Visakhapatnam grow in a planned manner, the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation ( GVMC ) has attended to nearly 2,600 unauthorised constructions over the last two years.

Such unauthorised constructions include additional floors, sheds, stairwells and other structures encroaching upon public land. The civic body acts against such encroachments upon receiving complaints from the public as well as on the basis of its own field inspections.

Over the last two years, GVMC has cracked the whip on nearly 1,100 encroachments. The civic body also identified 51 deviations from approved plans and cleared them out. A total of 133 extra floors, which had been constructed against building norms, were pulled down. The municipal corporation has removed 167 structures in total and has taken action against 11 parking violations.

Meanwhile, with property rates skyrocketing in the city, encroachments or additional unapproved floors are coming up indiscriminately. Cases are also being reported of people converting cellars into commercial spaces. There are reports of stairwells being constructed and compound walls being put up by encroaching upon public land.

Sometime ago, the city’s municipal corporation had taken up a special drive taking action against illegal structures. During the drive, the civic body removed nearly 100 unauthorised structures in a week. The drive had created a flutter in the city after it was found that the civic body had identified buildings belonging to senior politicians.

Environmentalists and the city’s larger civil society have been requesting GVMC to take strict action against illegal structures and encroachments.

Their focus has mainly been on buildings that have sprung on the beach roads in violation of CRZ (coastal regulation zone) norms.

City residents attribute this spurt in unauthorised constructions to the GVMC’s building penalisation scheme (BPS). The scheme, which has been reintroduced by successive governments at regular intervals, allows people to regularise unplanned structures retroactively. Therefore, illegal structures are first built and subsequently regularised through BPS.

Speaking to TOI, an official of the town planning wing of GVMC said that identification and razing of illegal structures is a continuous process and that field-level officials have been instructed to report illegal structures promptly.

A long-standing demand of the workers, the public transport department has finally decided to implement the change. The new uniforms will be designed keeping the working conditions in mind. The department has also asked workers to come up with suggestions with regard to the uniforms.

APPT commissioner Madireddy Pratap spoke to the workers during his visit to the Waltair bus depot to launch city buses that have been given an artistic makeover. It was in course of this conversation that Pratap indicated that the government was keen on changing the uniform of workers.

Speaking to TOI, Pratap said that the department has been planning to introduce blue-coloured t-shirts as uniforms. The shift to t-shirts, he said, is because t-shirts will be more comfortable than Khaki uniforms in summer.

“The comfort of our staff is our top priority. We are negotiating with a Tamil Nadu-based bulk supplier on this,” the commissioner added. The department is being mindful that the uniforms remain affordable.

Sources said that the state government might take help of the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) to design the uniforms. The state government’s intent to change the colour and pattern of the uniform has largely been welcomed by the workforce, according to Y Srinivasa Rao, general secretary of National Mazdoor Union (NMU).

The union leader further said that the t-shirts will help people work in coastal areas that have high humidity like Visakhapatnam at Kakinada. “The governments of Maharashtra and Karnataka have already adopted the same,” Rao added.

443,['2/03/2020'],Former MLA raises questions over Simhachalam trust board,"Visakhapatnam: Discussion on the appointment of Simhachalam Trust Board members is rife on social media platforms, with people questioning the move and the legal validity of such a board.

Sources in the Endowments department confirmed that the state government is planning a reshuffle of the board. It may pass another GO removing a few members to include certain people on the panel. However, the step by the government is being viewed by many as a step towards political appeasement resulting in the posting of a greater number of political appointees, curtailing the chances of others.

A source questioned the legal validity of the board.

Senior BJP leader and former Vizag north MLA Vishnu Kumar Raju said, “Somebody has to go to court citing the Supreme Court judgment of 2014 to relieve temples and devasthanams from the political control of the state government. Not just this government, but even previous governments have had exploited devasthanams by making politically-motivated appointments. Moreover, almost all such appointments have been political, making one question the credibility of such a board.”

The source sought to know if the board members were even aware of the traditions and rituals of a devasthanam as important as Simhachalam. “How come people who are not aware of the traditions of the temple find place as trustees? It is a must for such trustees to be well aware of the traditions associated with such temples. Board members cannot be arbitrarily appointed,” he asked.

Devotees have for long been worried about the protection of properties of devasthanams across the state and are well aware of the inability of these trust boards to protect them. Vishnu Kumar Raju said, “This is a known fact and cannot be disputed.”

However, the government is going ahead with the appointment of board members. “We are awaiting the GO, which should be given any time,” executive officer M Venkateswara Rao said.

At KGH, the gynaecology department saw 31 leap year babies born— 18 girls and 13 boys. Dr PV Sudhakar, principal of AMC said, “Of the 31 deliveries, 13 were C-section. All the deliveries were medically required, none was elective.”

446,['2/03/2020'],"Judges in controversy, courtesy judges","Justice Arun Mishra

NEW DELHI: Justice Arun Mishra courted controversy for devoting two sentences in his seven-page vote of thanks to describe PM Narendra Modi as an “internationally acclaimed visionary” and a “versatile genius, who thinks globally and acts locally”.

In an unprecedented step, the Supreme Court Bar Association led by Dushyant Dave adopted a resolution censuring Justice Mishra for singing paeans to the PM and appealed to judges to refrain from having close proximity with political executives to maintain judicial independence and faith of public in courts.

Justice Mishra’s praise for the PM — “thinks globally and acts locally” — was belied as communal riots singed parts of Delhi and the police, under the Centre’s control, appeared lethargic. The situation is now under control but it remains a mystery why the police had no inkling about the planning to unleash mayhem.

To Justice Mishra’s credit, he was honest about his admiration for the PM. There are many judges who wear different masks in public and private. More about that later. Let us first discuss an emerging trend among SC judges to portray themselves as champions of “peaceful protests anywhere” as a right intrinsic to the right to free speech and expression.

Given the Shaheen Bagh blockade for more than two months, should they have spoken about it? What if a similar case comes before them tomorrow? Will the parties, both pro and against, feel assured of justice? Will they recuse from hearing such cases having made public their views?

Recently, Justice Deepak Gupta said, “Right to dissent is the biggest right and, in my opinion, the most important right guaranteed by the Constitution.” He said those in power could not claim to represent the will of the people. Who then actually represents the will of the people? We would like to know.

Justice Gupta, now professing his love for dissent, was part of a diametrically opposite course of action on August 8, 2018, while being on a bench headed by Justice Madan B Lokur. When the bench suo motu took up encroachments in the whole of Himachal Pradesh, the state counsel pointed out that Justice Gupta’s wife had filed a PIL relating to encroachment of forest land in HP.

Mere pointing out of a fact got the bench’s goat. “Why is the state raising this issue? Does it not have anything better to do?” the bench asked. On finding that the counsel did not have a copy of the PIL, it said an officer of the court (lawyer) should neither be a mouthpiece nor “chammach” of the government. So much for free speech and dissent!

Justice D Y Chandrachud, in a much hailed recent speech, said, “Destruction of spaces for questioning and dissent destroys the basis of all growth — political, economic, cultural and social. In this sense, dissent is a safety valve of democracy.”

He was right. But a chronic obsession to criticise will not spare even the saintliest. Right to free speech is increasingly being used to score a point or scare a judge. Dissent and criticism are often aimed not to help a person amend mistakes but to make him squirm.

Take for example, Justice Chandrachud’s recent landmark judgment granting permanent commission to women officers in Army’s non-combat corps. In the judgment, ‘Ordnance’ was referred to as ‘Ordinance’ seven times. Would it be fair criticism if one says ‘the judge who does not know the difference between ‘Ordnance’ and ‘Ordinance’ is incapable of deciding a sensitive issue concerning the Army’? That would be unfair and below the belt.

Many renowned advocates and politicians, opposed to the present dispensation, resort to skullduggery to lament that never before had SC judges been so beholden to the political executive. We will go by the SC’s advice in D Ramaswamy judgment [(1982) 1 SCC 510], “Some times, past events may help to assess present conduct.”

A diehard Congressman, Bahrul Islam, resigned from Rajya Sabha to become a judge of Gauhati HC in 1972 and retired on March 1, 1980. Nine months after retirement, he became an SC judge in December 1980. Six weeks before retirement and a month after giving a clean chit to then Congress chief minister of Bihar Jagannath Mishra in a forgery case, he resigned from the SC to contest LS elections. The polls were postponed and he was elected as Congress MP to RS for a third time in June 1983.

One who somewhat mirrored Justice Islam was Justice Ranganath Misra , who diligently carried out the task assigned by then PM Rajiv Gandhi of inquiring into the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in Delhi and found no one responsible for the massacre of over 3,000 Sikhs. After retiring as CJI, Justice Misra headed the NHRC and went on to become an RS MP for Congress in 1998. Justices Islam and Misra didn’t need to sing paeans to the then PMs. They were masters of camouflaging their loyalties. And there were many more like them.

The SC judgment in R C Chandel case [2012(8) SCC 58] had said, “A judge, like Caesar’s wife, must be above suspicion. Credibility of the judicial system is dependent upon the judges who man it. For a democracy to thrive and rule of law to survive, justice system and judicial process have to be strong and every judge must discharge his judicial functions with integrity, impartiality and intellectual honesty.”

447,['2/03/2020'],Vizagites fast switching to cold pressed oils,"Visakhapatnam: While organic vegetables have been the rage for healthy eaters for some time, many households in the city are now switching to traditional cold pressed oils replacing refined oils. Nutritionists and other health professionals are of the opinion that cold-pressed oils retain most vitamins, macronutrients, antioxidants and phospholipids.

The extraction of oil through cold-press involves crushing the seed and forcing out the oil. Cold-pressing is a mechanical process in which the oil is extracted and separated without the use of chemicals or addition of foreign substances. Cold-pressing is typically done at temperatures less than 35°C.

According to city-based nutritionist K Sumanandini, consumption of cold-pressed oils can help return to a healthy way-of-life. “Cold pressed oils are extracted from oilseeds like sunflower, canola, coconut, and sesame seed without applying heat,” Sumanandini said. Usha Barani, managing director of a cold pressed oils manufacturing unit said, “With increasing cases of lifestyle diseases among youngsters, it is high time that people switch to products like cold-pressed oils.”

Aruna Kumari, a homemaker said, “I have switched to cold pressed oils over the last few months. I am feeling the difference both in cooking and the taste of the food. It is lighter and purer.”

Ramesh, who runs an oil mill in Akkayapalem said, “Since people are aware of traditional oils, we have started a live oil processing unit in our mill. We crush the seeds on a particular day every week. Customers are sent messages in the morning about when the oil would be extracted.”

448,['2/03/2020'],India pips Russia and Poland for $40m Armenia defence deal,"NEW DELHI: In a major success, India has bagged a deal worth $40 million to supply four indigenously-built weapon locating radars to Armenia by beating Russian and Polish firms.

“The deal is for supplying four Swathi weapon locating radars developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and manufactured by the Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) to Armenia in Europe,” government sources told the agency.

The supply of the equipment to Armenia has started and this is being seen as a big achievement for ‘Make in India’ programme in the defence sector, they said. Sources said Armenians had conducted trials of systems offered by Russia and Poland , but they decided to go for the reliable Indian system.

The four Swathi weapon locating radars will provide fast, automatic and accurate location of enemy weapons like mortars, shells and rockets in its 50-km range. The radar can simultaneously handle multiple projectiles fired from different weapons at different locations. The Indian Army is also using the same radars for its operations along the LoC in J&K. The system was given for trial to Army in 2018.

The Defence Ministry is also looking at other orders from South-East Asia, Latin America and Middle-East countries for boosting defence exports for which a target of Rs 35,000 crore has been set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi .

450,['2/03/2020'],Sewage mixing with drinking water in Haveri has residents worried,"Haveri: The supply of contaminated water to houses in parts of Haveri city for the past few days has rightly raised the hackles of the residents. The problem has been attributed to mixing of sewage water with potable water.

Highlighting the health hazards that consumption of contaminated water exposed one to, president of the Haveri Nagarika Vedike MS Korishettar said, “The drinking water supplied throughout the day has a foul smell. Leave alone drinking, this cannot even be used for other domestic purposes. Those drinking this water are falling sick.”

Korishettar said that, despite residents bringing the problem to the attention of the Haveri City Municipal Council (CMC) authorities, the officials concerned have not initiated any action. “I have written to the deputy commissioner Krishna Bajpai alerting them to the problem. If the authorities fail to solve this problem, we will protest in front of the CMC,” he added.

Supriya Tippanna, a homemaker in Basaveshwar Nagar, complained of clothes smelling bad after being washed with water supplied by CMC. “This has been happening for a week. Initially, I did not what was causing this problem. But it was only when my neighbours told me they were facing the same problem that I understood the cause,” Supriya said.

Worse still, sewage from the drains is flowing into the Akkamahadevi Pond for the past few days. “The CMC’s water pipeline has sustained damage in many sections. The worrying thing is that water leaking from the sewage pipes is flowing into the pipes that supply drinking water,” said Nadish Mallanagoudar, a resident of Siddarodha Colony.

Haveri DC Krishna Bajpai, however, said that he was yet to receive a formal complaint about the problem. “But we will look into this issue, which is serious, and the authorities concerned will be directed to solve it at the earliest,” Bajpai said.

451,['2/03/2020'],Garlic farmers dump produce on roads to produce APMC’s apathy,"Haveri: In a scene reminiscent of the agitation by onion farmers in Maharashtra, Haveri ryots on Sunday dumped the garlic on to the roads at the Ranebennur Agriculture Produce Market Committee ( APMC ) to protest the apathetic attitude of the officials concerned.

The garlic farmers were upset with the APMC officials for giving preference to the produce of sub-traders. The farmers said that the officials must prioritise the procurement of their crops over those sold by the sub-traders. Efforts by AMPC officials and traders to convince the furious farmers were unsuccessful, and the ryots proceeded to throw the garlic hauled in by the traders on to the road.

Unfortunately, Nagamma, a farmer who was at the Ranebennur APMC, took ill during the protest and was shifted to a hospital for treatment.

Hanumat Devaragudda, a farmer, felt that the APMC ought to protect the interests of the farmers. “But instead of ensuring our welfare, they neglected us, compelling us to launch a stir,” Devaragudda said.

Ranebennur APMC superintendent Mallikarjun AK pointed out that, of a total of 650 to 700 bags of garlic brought to the yard on Sunday, only 150 were hauled in by the farmers. “Majority of the produce was brought here by the sub-traders. The merchants wanted to procure produce in an orderly manner, but the farmers were adamant in their produce being purchased first. They dropped the protest after we convinced them,” said Mallikarjun.

The APMC authorities were forced to intervene and defuse the situation after the protest by the farmers brought transactions at the yard to a stop for two hours.

452,['2/03/2020'],KIMS adds PG diploma seats to MD and MS programmes,"Hubballi: In what is likely to enthuse students of medical courses in Karnataka, the prestigious Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences ( KIMS ), Hubballi has increased the number of seats for its postgraduate programmes – doctor of medicine (MD) and master of surgery (MS) – from 120 to 168. This is being achieved by converting the 48 seats currently offered for postgraduate diploma courses into a corresponding number of seats for MD and MS .

KIMS doctors said that the move was in keeping with directions issued by the Medical Council of India (MCI) to surrender the PG diploma seats so as to increase the intake for the postgraduate programmes. KIMS subsequently write to the central government seeking conversion of the 48 seats for the academic year 2020-21. The original plan was to hike the number of seats for MD and MS for the 2019-20 academic year, but this could not be achieved owing to technical reasons, said a KIMS doctor.

KIMS director Dr Ramlingappa Antartani told TOI, “This is good news for medical students. KIMS is North Karnataka’s most prestigious medical institute, and we will be accommodating more students to the three-year PG programmes from this academic year.”

The 48 PG diploma seats now defunct were offered in anaesthesia, ENT, dermatology, paediatrics, clinical pathology, ophthalmology, and gynaecology and obstetrics, he added. “Very few official procedures need to be followed to formally complete this procedure. We will have to inform our affiliate university about the increased intake for our PG programmes before we go ahead with the admissions,” Dr Antartani said.

Hailing MCI’s move to increase intake for three-year PG programmes, associate professor in plastic surgery at KIMS Dr SS Shirol said, “This will certainly multiply the number of opportunities for medical professionals. A three-year PG course adds more weight to one’s resume than a two-year diploma.”

On the advantages of the PG degrees, Dr Shirol said that students delved deeper into the subject they were spcialising in.

454,['2/03/2020'],"Karnataka Budget 2020: CM BS Yediyurappa may axe farm loan waiver, rename populist schemes","BS Yediyurappa (File Photo)

BENGALURU: The BJP government's budget on Thursday is likely to rationalize or scrap some of the populist schemes, including farm loan waiver, introduced by his predecessors HD Kumaraswamy and Siddaramaiah, besides renaming some popular among the beneficiaries.

The first to face the axe will be the farmers' loan waiver scheme. ""Considering the state's poor financial condition, the budget will have no room for continuation of the waiver scheme,"" a government official said. Instead, chief minister BS Yediyurappa is likely to announce a Rs 1,500-crore scheme to incentivise the farm sector.

With lack of funds from the Centre and sluggish tax collection, apart from political considerations, Yediyurappa may sideline schemes like Badavara Bandhu (interest-free loan to roadside vendors), incentive for Israeli model of dry land cultivation and Raitha Belaku (capital assistance to farmers up to Rs 10,000 per hectare).

Since scrapping the hugely popular Anna Bhagya could raise the hackles, the CM may reduce the quantity of rice distributed under this scheme from 7kg to 5kg a month.

""Many schemes, including Anna Bhagya, are under the scanner,"" admitted food and civil supplies minister K Gopalaiah, saying rationalisation of rice distribution would save the department Rs 600 crore a year.

BSY likely to rename some schemes

Yediyurappa is said to be mulling over renaming certain popular schemes. For instance, Airavatha, a scheme that helps dalit youths own taxis and partner with app-based aggregators, may be renamed Ambari.

Former social welfare minister Priyank Kharge, who was instrumental in launching the scheme, said he wasn’t worried about the renaming exercise, but wanted the scheme to continue since it benefits underprivileged youths.

In housing sector too, the government may conflate existing schemes into one. “With six schemes, two of which are centrally sponsored, duplication and misuse of funds are rampant. Hence, we are proposing to merge them,” said housing minister V Somanna.

Ex-CM HD Kumaraswamy said: “I’ve no objection if Yediyurappa wants to leave his stamp on the budget. More worrying is the government’s conspiracy to divert funds meant for welfare of farmers and the poor in the guise of new schemes. It’s an effort to hide the poor financial condition of the government.”

455,['2/03/2020'],‘Challenge for India to curb road fatalities’,"Union minister Nitin Gadkari (File photo)

STOCKHOLM/ NEW DELHI: For Indian participants at the recent global summit on road safety in Stockholm , it was a shock when Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf said 16 children died in road crashes in his country last year and “16 was not zero”. Even as India reported 9,977 fatalities of persons below 18 years in 2018, which translates to 27 persons in this age group dying daily in road accidents, it has hardly got enough attention of government agencies.

The Indian delegation at the recently held 3rd Global Ministerial Conference on Road Safety included road transport minister Nitin Gadkari , senior officials from transport and health ministries besides representatives from bodies in this sector.

Gadkari admitted that it was huge challenge for India to reduce road fatalities, considering that 11% of all deaths in road crashes were reported from India. “It’s a matter of huge concern that we continue to top the list of countries in road deaths. Countries which have reduced road deaths have focused primarily on two areas — road engineering and enforcement — and we need to address these issues rather than simply blaming drivers,” he told TOI.

Road safety activists who participated in the event said India can learn from Sweden , which has set a high standard and from Russia where road fatalities fell from 29,000 in 2011 to 19,000 in 2019 despite three-fold increase in number of vehicles.

Panicbuying of daily necessities emerged in Japan. Tourist sites across Asia, Europe and the Mideast were deserted. And governments closed schools and banned big gatherings. Australia and Thailand reported their first deaths on Sunday, while the Dominican Republic (first in tourist-rich Caribbean), Ireland and the Czech Republic recorded their first cases. Iran, Iraq , Italy and South Korea, among other places, saw the number of infections rise. More than 87,000 people worldwide have been infected, and nearly 3,000 have died.The US on Saturday recorded its first death, a man in his 50s in Washington state who had underlying health problems but who hadn’t travelled to any affected areas. Rhode Island reported its first “presumptive positive” virus case, a man in his 40s who had recently travelled to Europe.“Additional cases in the US are likely, but healthy individuals should be able to fully recover,” President Trump said at a Saturday briefing, where officials announced heightened warnings about travel to certain regions of Italy and South Korea as well as a ban on travel to Iran. Trump also vowed travellers from countries at high risk of the virus would be screened before boarding and upon arrival.China, where the outbreak began two months ago, on Sunday reported a slight uptick in new cases over the past 24 hours to 573, the first time in five days that the number exceeded500.

The final phase of the demolition was completed on Saturday under police presence.Motorists may not immediately feel the effect of the demolitions till the BMC utilizes the freed-up space to widen the road. The authorities want to widen the road to its full capacity, which is over 100 feet. Because of encroachments, LBS Road’s effective width was to 30-50 feet at several stretches.The BMC’s demolition squad faced resistance from certain areas. Recently, a big morcha was taken out till the ward office with the protesters demanding a halt to the demolition process, but civic authorities stood their ground.Demolition was carried out ward-wise. “In S Ward (Bhandup), 473 structures that came in the way of LBS Road’s widening were removed. In N Ward (Ghatkopar), 505 such structures were removed. A few structures still remain as their owners have moved court and decisions are awaited,” said deputy municipal commissioner Devendra Kumar Jain. “Most of the razed structures were commercial, with a few residences in between, and also a few religious structures. Owners who are eligible are being rehabilitated or compensated,” he added.Locals said that the demolition was much-needed as encroachments increased with each passing year, and the road lost almost half its width. They said the authorities must immediately work on to widen the stretch and ensure vehicular flow at the earliest to prevent the road from being re-encroached. “If the road is not widened well in time, street parking may start. This would then leave the entire exercise of removing the structures futile,” said activist Anil Galgali.BMC officials said they have taken adequate precautions to prevent such an eventuality. “As soon as a set of structures were demolished, work on laying a storm water drain (SWD) along the route would commence. This process will continue. After the SWD works are completed, the road would be widened to its full width,” said Jain.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74432211,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-743044,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lbs-road-cleared-of-1000-encroachments-in-3-months/articleshow/74432173.cms

BENGALURU: Congress legislature party leader Siddaramaiah, against whom disgruntlement is simmering, received support from unexpected quarters on Sunday when senior functionary DK Shivakumar said the former chief minister should not be viewed as a migrant.

“It is wrong to classify certain party members as originals and other functionaries as migrants,” Shivakumar said. “Once a party member, she/he belongs to the party. In politics we cannot be sure of anybody sticking to one single party,” Shivakumar told reporters.

He was replying to a question on rumours that some Congressmen has complained to the central leadership that Siddaramaiah is allegedly soft-pedalling the BJP government’s performance. They allegedly pointed to his presence at chief minister BS Yediyurappa’s birthday bash last week as evidence. Meanwhile, on the delay in appointing a KPCC president , Shivakumar said it is up to the party high command.

Former MP and senior functionary Mallikarjun M Kharge had also defended Siddaramaiah’s presence at Yediyurappa’s birthday bash.

459,['2/03/2020'],We will wrest Bengal: Shah.Say sorry for Delhi: Trinamool,"Kolkata: In his first major speech after the Delhi riots, home minister Amit Shah on Sunday expressed confidence that his party would form the government in Bengal with a two-thirds majority after the 2021 assembly polls, with CAA as its main vote-catching weapon, adding the Centre would not be deterred from implementing the act that grants Indian nationality to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, Parsis and Jains who have fled Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh due to religious persecution.

Addressing a public meeting at the Shahid Minar grounds in central Kolkata on Sunday, the home minister said CAA did not take away any Indian’s citizenship. “But our crores of brothers, who have come to India in the face of persecution and torture, who have lost their everything, whose women faced dishonour and whose temples and gurdwaras were broken, and faced forcible conversion... they do not have citizenship.”

His comments evoked a strong reaction from Trinamool. “Rather than coming and preaching (in) Bengal you should have explained and apologised for failing to save more than 50 innocent lives in Delhi violence right under your nose.... Bengal is better off without bigotry and hatred that BJP is trying to spread,” tweeted Abhishek Banerjee, the party’s No. 2. His comments come two days after party chief Mamata Banerjee said, at the EZC meeting in Odisha chaired by Shah, that she was “very sad about what happened in Delhi”.

On Sunday, Shah launched a campaign, ‘Aar Noi Anyay (No More Wrongs)’, in an attempt to counter Trinamool’s ‘Didi Ke Bolo’ initiative.

Ahead of the statewide civic polls scheduled in April, Shah’s comments were seen as an attempt to charge up the BJP ranks, at a time they have been feeling the heat of the Delhi riots. “We will form the next government in Bengal with a two-thirds majority,” he told the crowd, reminding them that BJP had got 2.3 crore votes in the state in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, up from 87 lakh in 2014.

The home minister's speech was suffused with Hindutva, as he brought up the emotional motif of the Ram Mandir at Ayodhya. “Modiji focused on vikas during his five-year tenure. For the next five years — with more than 300 MPs, of whom 18 are from Bengal — Modiji is working on the country’s security. He could deliver what Syama Prasad Mookerjee had yearned for: to make Kashmir an integral part of India. The next issue was constructing the temple. Modiji has already laid a hand on temple construction,” he said.

Shah also took pot shots at the Trinamool by charging the ruling party with propagating “dynastic rule” — so far used against the Congress — although he named neither Mamata Banerjee, nor her nephew, Abhishek Banerjee, who has emerged as the No. 2 in Trinamool. “I tell you that efforts to make the rajkumar (prince) an heir to the throne won’t work,” he thundered. “Bengal’s next CM will be the son of the soil.”

In a no-holds-barred attack, Shah claimed that it was the opposition parties who were actually instigating riots, in the guise of taking an anti-CAA stance. His tirade against Trinamool and Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had none of the restraint he had shown at the Eastern Zonal Council (EZC) meet in Bhubaneswar last Friday, when the two had come came face-to-face. “The opposition is terrorising minorities. I assure every person from the minority community that CAA only provides citizenship, does not take it away. It won’t affect your citizenship,” he said.

He accused Banerjee of “supporting CAA’s objectives” while in the opposition and adopting “appeasement” policies when in office, and said Trinamool’s stance had led to violence and destruction of railway property in the state. He reminded the gathering how Banerjee herself had raised the infiltration issue in Parliament when she was in the opposition. “Mamata Didi had raised the issue in Parliament. But she was back to appeasement and vote-bank politics when she came to power. Mamata, Congress, communists are all up in arms against CAA. I want to ask them what harm refugees did to them. They have been staying here for the last 70 years. No government ever thought of granting citizenship to these people tortured and driven out of their home and hearth,” he added.

Shah wanted party organisers to reach out to “every” household and connect with the people in a bid to bring Bengal on Modi’s development route. “People of Bengal have to wage this battle against autocracy, tolabazi, syndicate raj of the Trinamool regime. We will be with you. As many as 40 BJP activists have laid down their lives in the battle. Tell me why should the state government come in the way of farmers when the Modi government wants to give each of them Rs 6,000? We should rise against these and say during the ‘Didi Ke Bolo’ campaign, ‘Didi, aar noi anyay’,” Shah said.

KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday took to Twitter to say that it pained her “to witness the politics of discrimination being woven into the fabric of India”.Mamata’s statement, on Zero Discrimination Day, came hours before Union home minister Amit Shah landed in Kolkata and spoke at a pro-CAA rally at the Shahid Minar ground. “Let us pledge to uproot all forms of division based on caste, creed and religion from society. We will never stand for discrimination of any kind,” she tweeted.Speaking at the Kolkata rally, Shah claimed that BJP would form the next government in Bengal with two-thirds majority after the 2021 assembly polls and that no “shahzada” but a “son of the soil” will take over the reins as Bengal’s next CM. Batting for CAA, Shah said: “I assure every person from the minority community that CAA only provides citizenship, does not take it away.”The response came fast and sharp from Trinamool Congress MP Abhishek Banerjee. “Rather than coming and preaching (in) Bengal, you should have explained and apologised for failing to save more than 50 innocent lives in the Delhi violence right under your nose,” Abhishek tweeted. “Bengal is better off without bigotry and hatred that BJP is trying to spread,” he added.MP Mahua Moitra also mocked Shah’s claim that BJP would come to power in Bengal in 2021. “Amit Shah in Kolkata says ‘BJP in WB in 2021 with 2/3rd majority. Will bring ‘vikas’. Need a lesson in both basic arithmetic and language Mr. Shah? Truth is that you have 2-3 seats and not 2/3 in the West Bengal assembly. (You) will be wiped out in 2021, Delhi-style. You brought only ‘vinaash’, not ‘vikas’,” she said.Kolkata mayor and senior minister Firhad Hakim chose not to read much into Shah’s statement. “Keu ashe, keu jay. Amra chilam, achhi, thakbo. (Some come, some go. We were there, we are there and we will continue to be there),” he told reporters. The people of Bengal have rejected CAA and NRC, Hakim said, adding that “what do they have to say after leaving out 19 million Bengalis from the NRC in Assam? Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has been leading this movement against CAA and NRC. People are with her”.Mamata, who met Shah in Bhubaneshwar on Friday, had said that the Eastern Zonal Council inter-state meeting with the Centre was not the platform to discuss issues like CAA, NPR and NRC. “It was not the subject also. Yet, I told about it at the very outset when my turn came. I said we are deeply disturbed with what has happened in Delhi. So many people died, including an IB officer and a police constable. I said we want the government to stand by the victims’ families,” she had said after the meeting.Mamata has announced a rally against CAA-NPR-NRC in Kolkata on March 8. She is also likely to speak on the issue at a party conclave of all civic body office-bearers at Netaji Indoor stadium on Monday.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74436941,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-296563,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/politics-of-discrimination-and-division-must-stop-mamata/articleshow/74431958.cms

462,['2/03/2020'],FRRO asks Polish student at JU to leave country after anti-CAA protest,"Kolkata: A Polish postgraduate student at Jadavpur University ’s (JU) comparative literature department has been served notice to leave India within a fortnight by the Foreigners Regional Registration Officer (FRRO) for his alleged participation in an anti CAA/NRC rally in central Kolkata on December 19.

Kamil Siedcynski was told that his conduct was “inappropriate for a foreign national staying in India on a student visa”.

JU sources said the notice was issued to him on February 22. Kamil has informed the Embassy of Poland and appealed to the FRRO that he had merely gone to click photographs, which “should not be construed as participating in the rally”. Scheduled to leave India in August, he has appealed that he be allowed to stay in India till July to complete his course. He has also undertaken not to go to any such programme while in India.

This is the second such order issued by the Kolkata FRRO. On February 14, a Bangladeshi undergraduate student of Visva-Bharati had been asked to leave India after she posted photographs of an anti-CAA protest on social media. Afsara Anika Meem, a senior lawyer informed, is likely to challenge the order in Calcutta High Court this week.

Kamil is in India in a student exchange programme from the University of Warsaw. He has recently translated Polish folk-tales into Bengali. He had earlier been a student of Bengali literature at Visva-Bharati and can speak the language fluently. He was in Santiniketan when he received an e-mail to report to the FRRO on February 22. On that day, he was reportedly issued notice to leave India within a fortnight. He, however, did not respond to calls.

Former MLA Tarun Naskar, who was in the rally in which Kamil, as alleged by the FRRO, participated, criticised the move. The rally from Ram Leela Maidan in central Kolkata’s Moulali to Esplanade had drawn several students and academics. “This is an attack on freedom of speech and expression. Why should Kamil be asked to leave India? Is taking photographs an anti-national act, or is it a political act? This muscle-flexing should be stopped immediately,” said Naskar, who is also the vice-president of All Bengal University Teachers Association.

“Kamil had gone to the rally not to participate but to click photographs,” said a JU teacher. “He has categorically said he did not participate in the protest. At that event, somebody clicked his photographs and published it on social media. Some people probably forwarded this to the FRRO. Kamil has no political leanings, but his enthusiasm to attend the protest rally and click photographs landed him in trouble.”

A senior JU official said the authorities may meet on Monday to decide what they can do to help the student. A large section of students and teachers has decided not to launch any protest because they do not want to jeopardize his academic prospects at JU. “It is his last semester and we want him to complete it. Any irresponsible comment or activity can mar his prospects of completing studies, which we don’t want,” said a JU professor.

463,['2/03/2020'],Riot-hit labourer in Siliguri hosp,"Malda: A North Dinajpur labourer who took a bullet in his head during the Delhi riots was admitted to North Bengal Medical College Hospital in Siliguri on Sunday as the bleeding in his brain is yet to stop. Ajit Sheikh returned home to Pajole village in Itahar in this north Bengal district the day before.

On February 25, Ajit, a construction worker in Delhi for over 8 years, was returning home from work when he got caught in the violence at Daryaganj. He was shot in the head and fell unconscious. Rescued by police, he was admitted to Army Hospital, where an emergency operation extracted the bullet.

The district administration has promised to help with his treatment. “We are in touch with the labourers who have returned home from Delhi. Some are wounded. The district administration is providing all possible assistance to them,” said DM Arvind Kumar Meena said.

Ajit’s wife, who is by his side, does not wish to return to Delhi. “I want to be home,” she said. Their family, too, wants them to stay back.

Sabina, her injured husband, their two children and several others from the district returned by Anand Vihar Express on Saturday, reaching Raiganj, where Ajit was admitted to Raiganj Medical College. A CT scan revealed that although the bullet had been removed, the bleeding in his brain had not stopped. Doctors said the two-day train journey had worsened his condition and referred him to NBMCH.

Since the Delhi violence, hundreds of migrant labourers have returned home to North Dinajpur. Akhtar Ali, of Gouri village, said: “For four days, we could not come out until police rescued us and helped us catch a train.”

Saddam Hossain, of Bariol Ghat in Raiganj, said: “I don’t know whether I’ll return.” Rajjak Ali, another labourer, is worried about friends who could not return. “We could catch the train home but many are still there.”

465,['2/03/2020'],"After Delhi, ‘Goli maaro...’ slogans now in Kolkata","Kolkata: The slogan “Goli maaro saalon ko (Shoot the traitors)” reared its ugly head in the heart of central Kolkata on Sunday, with several BJP supporters headed to Union home minister Amit Shah’s rally shouting it out in an attempt to heckle and intimidate anti-CAA protesters, who responded by drowning out the hate chant with cries of “Halla Bol”.

Cops had a tough time keeping the rival groups away from each other.

The controversial, incendiary slogan was raised by several BJP campaigners before the Delhi assembly polls last month, notably Union minister Anurag Thakur, during a campaign. Lashing out against anti-CAA protesters, he shouted “Desh ke gaddaron ko...”, to which the crowd responded by saying “...goli maaro saalon ko”. More recently, on Saturday, the slogan was again raised by a group of youths at Delhi’s Rajiv Chowk Metro station.

At Kolkata, the anti-CAA activists started gathering near The Oberoi Grand in Esplanade — on Jawaharlal Nehru Road — from the afternoon, hours before Shah reached the rally venue. Most of them were carrying “Go Back Amit Shah” banners and posters, chanting anti-CAA slogans. Around 2pm, the rallyists — comprising nearly 200 activists — were trying to head towards the Dorina crossing, when a rally of BJP workers, mainly people from south Kolkata neighbourhoods, reached the spot. Slogans from the activists prompted BJP supporters to counter, and they started shouting, “Desh ke gaddaron ko/ Goli maaro saalon ko”. The situation turned tense within a minute, and the cops quickly swung into action. They positioned themselves in the middle of the road to prevent the situation from escalating.

Thespian Kaushik Sen felt that people in Bengal were already being polarised on religious lines. “A strong Hindutva narrative is being constructed. Along with the religious polarisation, people are being divided into political camps based on hatred. It will not be long before people try to re-enact Delhi on the streets of Kolkata,” he told TOI. Organisations like the No-NRC Movement have planned campaigns against the hate slogan from Monday. “Students, mainly from Jadavpur University, IIEST-Shibpur and Presidency University were present during the agitation at Esplanade. There was no provocation from their end. We have seen in Delhi how disruptive such slogans had been. It is time to start campaign against such hatred,” said Kamal Sur, one of the conveners of the No-NRC Movement.

BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu defended the hate slogan. “How else do you expect people to react? They have been instigated over propaganda and fake news in the past couple of weeks. That has sparked anger among them and they are now identifying anti-national forces,” he said. Bankura’s BJP MP Subash Sarkar, however, claimed Left and Congress supporters had infiltrated their meeting and tried to give it a bad name.

The Left and Congress were quick to condemn it. CPM leader Sujan Chakraborty felt the hate speech, which stung Delhi hard, was now strategically being “imported” to Bengal. “We have not heard this slogan on the streets of Kolkata before. It is provocative enough to inject hatred among people. Of late, it was often heard in Delhi while the riot was on. Today, it was juxtaposed with Shah’s visit to Kolkata,” he said.

“It is surprising that those who shouted ‘Goli maaro’ were not arrested by the police,” state Congress president Somen Mitra said. “They continued to shout slogans and went to the rally site. Those who constantly try to disintegrate the nation and compare India with Pakistan at the drop of a hat are the real traitors. I salute those who dared to shout ‘Go back’ on the streets today.”

Protests against CAA and Shah’s visit spanned the breadth of the city. Left activists took out rallies at Kaikhali, near the Kolkata airport. SFI and DYFI also took out rallies at Shyambazar, Gariahat, Behala and Entally. CPM hit the streets and burnt Shah’s effigy at Jadavpur. Protest rallies were taken out at Moulali and Ram Lila ground. Pradesh Youth Congress organised a stir at the CIT Road and CR Avenue crossing, demanding Shah’s resignation. Chhatra Parishad members, too, staged a dharna at the Dorina crossing.

466,['2/03/2020'],Madhyamgram NSG unit gets New Town address,"Kolkata: Union home minister Amit Shah announced here on Sunday that the government was working on a plan that would enable security forces personnel to spend at least 100 days every year with their families.

Shah inaugurated the hub of the 29 Special Composite Group of National Security Guard at New Town. He also inaugurated facilities for NSG units in Manesar, Chennai, Mumbai and Hyderabad through video-conferencing.

His announcement will be hailed by men in uniform, particularly soldiers and personnel of paramilitary and Central Armed Police Forces posted in difficult areas who don’t get sufficient leave to visit their homes and families. Repeated denial of leave results in bitterness even among the best of men and may lead to operational errors and fragging or suicide.

Shah repeatedly used the term ‘satisfaction ratio’ while addressing the officers, personnel of other ranks and their families at the inauguration ceremony. An issue brought up by NSG director general Anup Kumar Singh was housing. He wondered how only about 25% of elite commandos get quarters within hubs. The others have to spend a lot on housing as the hubs are located in metropolitan cities.

“I assure you that in five years; our government will fulfil all your demands, be it better care for families, housing, training, equipment, techniques and information gathering. Our security personnel dedicate the best years of their lives to the country. We can provide better housing, equipment, techniques and modern weapons but it is passion that helps win battles. Citizens of the country feel safe today because of NSG. This government has adopted a zero-tolerance policy towards terrorism and NSG plays a key role. Its mere presence should deter terrorists from entering the country. Those who want to break the country into pieces and spread terror should be scared by your presence. If they decide to enter despite that, you will have to finish them off,” he said.

The minister also spoke of the Narendra Modi government’s proactive security policy that is totally separate from its foreign policy. “Earlier, there was no clear distinction between the two. Our government will do everything for those who protect the country. There is a time-bound programme that I am looking after. Under this, all security forces personnel will get to spend at least 100 days with their families. I would only urge NSG to work towards reducing the time of operations. Terrorists know they are headed towards death and their only motive is to spread terror among the 130 crore citizens. The longer they can carry on, the better for them. That is why operations need to be completed faster,” Shah added.

467,['2/03/2020'],Hate speech inaction: Bengal actor quits BJP,"Kolkata: Actor-turned-politician Subhadra Mukherjee has resigned from BJP in the aftermath of the Delhi violence. She had joined the party in 2013.

Mukherjee claimed it was not possible for her to be in the same party with functionaries such as Kapil Mishra and Anurag Thakur, both of whom faced criticism over ‘Goli maaro’ remarks made in the run-up to Delhi assembly polls.

The actor, who sent her resignation to Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh, said she had joined the party with a lot of “hopes and optimism”, but was disillusioned following the recent developments. Claiming “BJP was moving away from its ideology”, Mukherjee said she was in favour of Citizenship (Amendment) Act but did not agree with the way the party pressed ahead with it.

“It has resulted in unrest across the country. Why should we all have to show papers after so many years into independent India to prove our citizenship?” she said.

“The atmosphere is filled with hate,” Mukherjee added. “No action is being taken against party leaders such as Anurag Thakur and Kapil Mishra despite their hate speeches, which caused a deterioration in the situation. How can I be in a party that is selective in taking action?”

She said she could not identify with a party that treated people on the basis of their religion and not as fellow humans.

469,['2/03/2020'],Policing overhaul is not about power tussle: UP CM Yogi Adityanath,"Yogi Adityanath

NOIDA: The introduction of the commissionerate system was in keeping with an old demand and not about any power tussle, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said on Sunday while inaugurating the new police commissionerate office at Noida’s Traffic Park in Sector 108.

“Demand for the commissionerate system was an old one, but the lack of will was visible. But we have implemented it in two districts for smart policing. Nowhere is there a conflict for rights,” said Yogi.

For years, the distribution of power between IAS and IPS officers under the SP system had been contentious territory. While police said the need for civic approval for action slowed them down, bureaucrats argued it was necessary to have checks and balances in place. In January, Gautam Budh Nagar and Lucknow moved to the commissionerate system, changing the power dynamics and investing powers that earlier lay with the administration to the police.

Attributing the decision to a need for “safe environment for citizens”, he added, “Changing times needed that instead of following rhetoric and limiting ourselves to a fight for rights, we focus on the security of citizens, better management of law and order, and smart policing.” Hinting at the problems caused by redtapism, Yogi said the condition of police barracks at Lucknow police lines had been terrible. “But when I asked, the principal secretary (home) told me there was a lack of funds. I said it was not a lack of funds but flawed intentions. Fix it and bring me a proposal.”

The 18 commissionerates in the state will soon get a cybercrime police station and a forensic lab each. “The police and forensic university bill has been passed recently and we hope to start work on the university soon,” he said.

Development was a thread he connected to improved policing in the state. “When we came to power, Samsung was about to wind up and TCS was ready to leave Lucknow. Industrialists did not want to invest in UP. But when there was an improvement in security, the results were for everyone to see,” he said.

After Sunday’s events, he is scheduled to inaugurate and flag off projects worth Rs 2,821 crore on Monday — including the multi-level car parking at Botanical Garden metro station, the basement car park in Sector 5 and the footover bridge across Noida-Greater Noida Expressway in Sector 145, among others.

Meanwhile, farmers who had been protesting outside the Noida Authority on a wide range of problems over the past 21 days said they had been put under house arrest for the CM’s visit to Noida.

“We had been preparing for a meeting with the CM. But around 3.30pm, a police team arrived at the house of Sukhveer Pehalwan (a peasant activist who has been leading the protests) and put everyone under house arrest,” said Sudesh, Sukhveer’s brother.

Police denied this and said they had only gone over to “have a conversation” about law and order.

Before-and-after images show how nitrogen dioxide levels plummeted in February compared to pre-lockdown January of this year. Nitrogen dioxide is a noxious gas emitted by factories , motor vehicles and fossil fuel-powered electricity generation stations.Nasa scientists first detected the decline of pollutants near Wuhan in Hubei province. “This is the first time I have seen such a dramatic drop-off over such a wide area for a specific event,” said Fei Liu, an air quality researcher at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center.China’s pollutant levels decline in February as factories pause for Lunar New Year celebrations, when the world’s largest annual mass migration occurs. “(But) this year, the reduction rate is more significant than in past years and it has lasted longer,” Liu said.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74432247,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-611721,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/no-pollution-across-chinas-industrial-heartland/articleshow/74432248.cms
471,['2/03/2020'],Nearly 18 lakh cases stuck in Karnataka courts,"TimesView The numbers are staggering, laying out an incontestable case for reforms, which have not moved very far from the debate circuit. Not just in Karnataka, courts across the country are grappling with a huge backlog of cases, a problem which causes unimaginable anguish to citizens seeking justice and resolution. It’s understandable that courts are cautious about embracing technology, whose use in courthouses and their processes around the world has been mostly experimental. But there are some steps which can be taken promptly: ensuring the sanctioned strength of judges and judicial officers and preventing cases with no merit from clogging up the system.

BENGALURU: Unlike wine, court cases don’t age well. The more they grind on, the more despair they bring for people hoping for a fair or reasonable outcome. Courts in Karnataka have more than their share of such cases. As of February 27, 2020, the backlog stood at nearly 18 lakh.To put it in perspective: even if every judicial officer and judge of lower courts and the high court works for 365 days without a single leave, they will still have to dispose of at least five cases daily to clear the mountain of pending matters.Add to this the number of new cases filed every month, and the task only gets more complicated. In January this year, 6,355 fresh cases — on average, over 200 every day — were filed in the Karnataka high court alone. Lower courts also receive hundreds of new complaints, applications and petitions daily.Activists say slow-moving cases upend lives, bankrupting many families in civil disputes and forcing hundreds of undertrials to spend more time in prison than they would have after a conviction.“The system has given a false hope to the litigants that even if they fail, they can take advantage of the long-drawn process, which leads to speculative litigation. That is, even if a litigant knows there’s no case, they move courts to harass the opponent. In my view at least 50 per cent of the cases are speculative,” former Supreme Court judge Santosh Hegde told TOI. “...if we have to reduce pendency, the government and the Supreme Court must sit together and come to consensus on how to go about reducing the number of appeals. As in the US, the high court must be the final court for all matters other than constitutional matters. In lower courts and high courts, speculative litigation must be scrutinised, and penalties must be levied.”Of the 17.8 lakh pending cases, 15.5 lakh are in lower courts in Karnataka. The remainder are before the various benches of the high court. There are 1,104 judicial officers and judges across all courts in the state.The high court has a sanctioned strength of 62 judges; about 36 per cent of the posts are vacant. There are 1,064 judicial officers in district and subordinate courts as against the sanctioned strength of 1,303, a shortfall of 19 per cent. While the figure of high court vacancies is current, that of lower courts was last updated in December 2019.The individual burden of work is much higher for high court judges. To shrink the pile of pending cases, each judge would have to dispose of at least 16 cases every day for the next full year without breaks.Karnataka (all courts put together) has the highest number of pending cases among southern states (Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu).Of the nearly 18 lakh cases in Karnataka, 49 per cent pertain to civil matters, while 47 per cent are criminal ones. The rest are writ petitions. Thirty-three per cent of the total cases have dragged on for one to three years. While 2,035 have been pending for 20 to 30 years, another 141 have pending for over 30 years.Twenty-one per cent of the pending cases, or nearly 3.9 lakh, were filed by senior citizens and women. A former high court judge had told TOI that while vacancies must be filled up on a war footing, one must ensure that advocates being appointed as judges had practised both civil and criminal law.Advocate KV Dhananjay also recommended that positions of judges should be filled up and the number of appeals should be reduced. “I think we are not too far away from getting artificial intelligence in judiciary. There has been some movement in this direction in other countries. For instance, IBM has demonstrated a robot which can make live arguments using AI in the US. While nothing concrete has happened so far, we could be on the cusp of a revolution and I think India won’t lag in this aspect when there is enough evidence that technology would work,” Dhananjay said.He said AI could help decrease the time taken to resolve cases, thereby preventing piling up of matters.ST Ramesh, a former Karnataka director general of police, lamented the lack of progress. “There has been a lot of talk on the issue, but very little action by the government and other stakeholders. First, the ratio of judges to the population and cases must be scientifically determined. As it is, in India, many people have no access to justice and even if you look at those who have access, the ratio of judges is not enough. Second, there has been a delay in digitisation in the judiciary. These issues must be addressed,” he said.Every section of the system — police, forensics, courts — must be connected and the method to deal with cases should change, he said.“Not all the fault is with the judiciary. Police and prosecutors must also understand that some cases do not merit time in the court, and they must be firm on making decisions in such matters,” he added.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74432251,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-743810,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/nearly-18-lakh-cases-stuck-in-karnataka-courts/articleshow/74432242.cms

492,['2/03/2020'],Nirbhaya Case Latest News: Supreme Court to consider curative plea of Nirbhaya convict today,"Pawan Gupta

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court will on Monday consider 'in chamber' the curative plea of one of the four death row convicts, Pawan Gupta, in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, a day before their scheduled hanging. The curative petition will be considered by a bench of justices N V Ramana, Arun Mishra, R F Nariman, R Banumathi and Ashok Bhushan in the chamber of Justice Ramana.

Pawan (25), against whom the death warrant has been issued for execution on March 3 along with the other three convicts, has claimed juvenility to seek commutation of sentence to life imprisonment. He has filed the curative plea through lawyer A P Singh seeking setting aside of SC's earlier verdicts on appeals and review petitions in the case.

Pawan is the last death row convict in the case to move SC with his curative plea, the final legal remedy available to a person. He and another convict Akshay Singh also moved a trial court on Saturday seeking stay on the execution of death warrants. The trial court has issued notice to Tihar authorities on the pleas, directing the officials to file their response by Monday.

While Akshay has claimed he has filed a fresh mercy petition before the President of India, which is pending, Pawan said he has moved a curative plea before Supreme Court.

Nirbhaya's mother hopes SC will dismiss curative petition of convict Pawan Gupta

Delhi gang rape victim Nirbhaya's mother Asha Devi on Monday expressed hope that the curative petition of Pawan Kumar Gupta, one of the four death row convicts in the case, will be rejected by the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear today Gupta's curative petition seeking commutation of his death penalty to life imprisonment.

Speaking to ANI Asha Devi said, ""Supreme Court will hear the curative petition of Pawan Kumar Gupta and I hope that the petition is rejected by the court.""

""The case is clear before the court the plea will be rejected today,"" she said.

Asha Devi said that the law has been misused and how many times the court will postpone its own decision.

""They are misusing the law and government should look into it, how many times the court will postpone its own decision?"" she asked.

She said that the process of execution is making an impact on the society and people are losing hope in the judiciary.

""The way the execution of the convicts is getting delayed, it is making an impact on society and people now are somewhere losing hope in the judiciary,"" she said.

She requested that all the mercy pleas pending with the President of India and all the petitions in the court be rejected ""without any further delay"" and the convicts be hanged on March 3.

The Supreme Court will today hear the curative petition filed by Pawan Kumar Gupta, seeking commutation of his death penalty to life imprisonment in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case.

The case pertains to the brutal gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old paramedical student in a moving bus on the night of December 16, 2012, by six people including a juvenile in Delhi. The woman had died at a Singapore hospital a few days later.
