1,['9/03/2020'],I’ve no intention of doing a full-fledged comedy role: Gopi,"Actor Badava Gopi is feeling ecstatic as his role in Naan Sirithal has been getting thumbs up from the audiences and critics alike. But when he was first approached for the role of Hiphop Adhi ’s father, Gopi was sceptical. He says, “I got a call from Sundar C’s production house two year ago, asking if I’d be willing to play the role of a father. I was sceptical as I was trying to establish myself as an actor in the industry and didn’t want to take up something that didn’t have any significance. But I decided to meet the director (Raana) and ask him why he thought of me for the role. Raana told me that he wanted to cast me after seeing my performance in 3. He also gave me a brief about the role and I thought I’d give it a try. I went back home and told the kids in the family about this. They were also unsure about it and asked me why I was taking up a father’s role as it might not be significant. But once they heard that Adhi was the hero, they were very happy.”It seems the actor’s role was rewritten after Raana saw him perform. “I finished shooting for my portions in three days and went to the US for personal work. Raana called me up, saying that he really liked the father-son chemistry and wanted to shoot with me for a couple of more days. Adhi and Raana rewrote my portions, and it is because of them that I am getting appreciation from all quarters,” says Gopi. So, what kind of roles does the actor see himself in? “I’ve no intention of doing a full-fledged comedy role. I want to try character roles, something more emotional, or even negative. People have seen in me the role of a cricket commentator, teacher etc. But I want to be more than that. I am waiting for such interesting roles.

Talking about her comeback character, Tejaswini says, “I play the role of Indra, an honest and efficient sub-collector officer. She aspires to help create an egalitarian society. Her first challenge as an officer is to ensure that a government school in a village remains open to provide education to under-privileged children.

And the administrative body is adopting creative ways to spread awareness about cleanliness.

4,['9/03/2020'],Be emotional. Be a leader.,"Direct. Assertive. Competitive. Cut-throat. Hard taskmaster. These are all traits that have been celebrated in the corporate world all over the world. To be a thorough professional and truly belong to the work culture, people honed such skills, even if they weren’t natural traits or came easy to them. The corporate world asked people to be aggressive, fierce, unsparing, in their outlook towards life. How else does one survive a ruthless world where there are only so many seats at the top, and innumerable people fighting for it?Turns out that you do survive, in fact, thrive sans these qualities. Over the past decade, many studies have shown that natural feminine traits make for great leadership. The keyword here is natural. Qualities such as empathy, persuasiveness, listener, caring, mostly attributed to women, make for great leaders.Scholar, author and professor of organisational behaviour, Dr Julian Barling, says in an interview to minervabc.ca that societal bias against women in workforce, and restricting them to household work for centuries has actually given women the edge to become better leaders than men. He explains how. “… women may have an edge due to their socialisation. To get to a leadership position, they had to accomplish so much more than men. Women, as a group, are more democratic, participative and transformational than men.”Think about it. In most Indian households, women take everyday decisions, be it groceries, bills or attending to emotional needs to raising children. This multi-tasking has gone a long way to make them see the larger picture. Without raised voices, and specifically on the strength of their feminine traits (empathy, listening power, persuasiveness, being collected), they have been managing a far more unpredictable deadline than the kind that the corporate world sets: managing elders in the family, bringing up children with the right values, all the while dealing with daily bickering. Much like a workplace.A Harvard Business Review analysis on leadership qualities in men and women says, “women in leadership positions are perceived just as — if not more — competent as their male counterparts. In fact, while the differences were not huge, women scored at a statistically significantly higher level than men on the vast majority of leadership competencies measured”.Says image consultant and etiquette coach Konkana Bakshi, “The ability to put yourself in somebody else’s shoes, especially during adversities is one of the most important skills for leadership. Superior attitude and demeaning behaviour is a business etiquette faux pas.”Canadian actor and singer Andrea Menard wrote about feminine leadership on her website a while ago. She says, “Innovative women are changing the leadership paradigm because the focus has moved from pleasing shareholders to making the consumer happy.”Brand and business strategist Devapriya Khanna agrees. “Feminine leadership traits are being consciously cultivated by progressive organisations as a means to stay relevant in an increasingly competitive, complex and dehumanised business environment,” she says, adding that while feminine traits are stereotypically expected to be found in female leaders, she considers these qualities to be gender agnostic. “I would consider ‘active listening’ to be the one skill that needs to be focused upon the most. An inclusive style of communication, often considered a woman’s forte, helps nurture more accountability, greater trust and shared purpose.”EmpathyCaringAbility to listenPersuasiveParticipativeDemocratic",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74508050,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-587813/74508050.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/relationships/work/be-emotional-be-a-leader-/articleshow/74508050.cms

6,['9/03/2020'],"'Making biopics has become a commercial exercise in Bollywood', says Anant Mahadevan","Known for his distinct roles in cinema and television, actor-filmmaker Anant Mahadevan was in town recently for the screening of his Marathi film Mai Ghat: Crime No 103/2005 at the Bengaluru International Film Festival. Ananth admitted that he gets inspired by real-life stories, especially those of unsung heroes. Excerpts from a conversation...Biopics made in the regional industries are comparatively cleaner in terms of their portrayal of characters. They are more relatable, hard-hitting and manage to maintain the sanctity of the actual story. Unfortunately, though, the Hindi film industry has turned making biopics more or less into a money-making scheme. It has become a commercial exercise in Bollywood. Most of these biopics are based on people who have already been there in the limelight; have a huge fan following and are well-liked — all the factors you may need for a film to do well on screens. But what about those unsung heroes who have remained unheard of because, we are not using a powerful medium like cinema to narrate their story? Many a time, you’ll find articles or news about how the person on whose life the movie is based is not happy with the way his/her life is portrayed in it. Why do you think that happens? In Bollywood, there are catchy dance sequences and comical elements. The entire narrative of the biopic is lifted to an unrealistic pedestal, with the subject often being depicted with an appropriate perspective or the exact opposite of that. There are no grey areas of the character that are covered. So, are these stories justified, factually? No, they are not.Because, I have graduated from one role to the other over the years, my experience has helped gain a more comprehensive view of any film, serial or script in the beginning of a project itself. If I have to give an analogy to explain this further, it would be similar to how a child evolves over the years of schooling — from kindergarten to graduating from high school. I joined the film industry as an actor, then tried my hand at writing, then moved on to directing films and, now, I even edit. These roles definitely have reduced my fondness for certain patterns of filmmaking or acting. It has allowed me to create a niche for myself, particularly through the films that I have directed. I feel that approaching individuals with stories that are sensitive in nature, is another factor that needs to be looked into by many filmmakers.Yes, in a very crucial way. Subtitles have played an amazing role in crossing the language barriers. Now, India is known for its cultural diversity. But in the future, it could also be known for its diversity in films. In the recent times, regional films have received a good response at international festivals, particularly for their realistic portrayal of subjects.Funding is an issue. But I have, somehow, been lucky in terms of arranging for money for my films. Maybe, it’s because people trust me as a director after seeing my work as an actor. But that doesn’t mean that I get a lot of money. It’s just enough to make a decent film. Mai Ghat: Crime No 103/2005 was made in Marathi because, there wasn’t enough money to dub the film in other languages. Also, the Marathi film industry has made a mark in off-mainstream regional cinema, so I knew that I’d have better chances of getting a bigger audience there.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74537559,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-95478/74537559.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/making-biopics-has-become-a-commercial-exercise-in-bollywood-says-anant-mahadevan/articleshow/74537540.cms

17,['9/03/2020'],Kerala deliver killer blow at the endþ,"Margao: Gokulam Kerala FC left it late to edge past Churchill Brothers FC 2-1 and move up the I-League table in a fierce encounter at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Sunday.

Nathaniel Garcia had given Gokulam Kerala a first-half lead but Churchill fought back with a goal from Lalkhawpumawia in the 72nd minute. It seemed like the teams would settle for a point which wouldn’t do any side any good, until Henry Kisekka struck the match winner in the 90th minute.

The win was good enough for the visitors to surge to the top. From seventh, they are now fifth, tied on 22 points with two others, and just one behind second-placed Punjab FC. The race for the second spot is hugely significant, particularly since ATK are now in the final of the Indian Super League (ISL), and should they win, Mohun Bagan’s assumed champion spot – for AFC Cup -- would be given to the runnersup.

Judging from the early season form, Churchill and Gokulam Kerala should have been challenging for the I-League title. Gokulam Kerala were in terrific form at the start of the season, even winning the Durand Cup without breaking a sweat, while Churchill won three games in a row at the start, including a prized 4-2 scalp of Mohun Bagan in Kolkata. Since then, both teams have gone downhill, unable to catch up with the rest.

With the second spot possibly offering something, the teams knew they needed full points to stake claim. They started positively with end-to-end action and it were the visitors who drew first blood. It was all thanks to some brilliant work from the left by captain Marcus Joseph, and a lazy defence. Joseph worked his way inside the box from the left and essayed the ball into the goalmouth where Garcia was on hand to turn it home.

Churchill were taken aback by the setback. But credit to them for the fightback. They created several chances with Quan Gomes and Ceesay Dawda pulling the strings, although like it has happened so many times in the past, they lacked the cutting edge upfront.

Churchill’s attacking threat increased with the inclusion of Israil Gurung. Along with full-back Lamgoulen Hangshing, they were a terror on the right flank and it was Israil’s freekick that got them level. For most part, Lalkhawpumawia was erratic in front of goal and Gokulam Kerala goalkeeper CK Ubaid was confidence personified. Then in the 72nd minute, roles were reversed. A freekick from Gurung saw the keeper make a mess with the push and the ball fell at the feet of Lalkhawpumawia, who didn’t make a mistake inside a crowded goalmouth.

To be fair, almost-immediately, Ubaid kept his team in the hunt with a brilliant save to deny Plaza from close-range, and as the minutes ticked by, Kerala got the winner. It came with Joseph, yet again, giving a good account of himself. He worked his way on the left and crossed where Kisekka darted from in between two defenders to score the match winner.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kerala-deliver-killer-blow-at-the-end/articleshow/74543075.cms
18,['9/03/2020'],"I’ve sparred with Goan boxers, they are eager to learn: Nikhat","Panaji: Nikhat Zareen doesn’t need any introduction. The former junior world champion grabbed headlines when she challenged MC Mary Kom , demanded a trial for the Tokyo Olympic qualifiers and knocked on the doors of the sports ministry.

She eventually got her way, fought Mary Kom, and even though she lost, there is enough proof to suggest she is the one to look out for in the future.

""I defeated (national champion) Jyoti (Gulia). I gave my everything (at the trial) and don't have any regret. However, I look forward to future,"" she told TOI .

Having lost the chance to move ahead of Mary Kom and give the Tokyo Olympics a try, the Telangana boxer must now channelise her energy elsewhere. There is the National Games, Senior Nationals and then the Asian Championships.

Nikhat is in Goa as chief guest for the final day of the Goa state boxing championship and believes Goan boxers are eager to learn.

""I have been to Goa before and found boys and girls have interest to learn and make an impact at the national level. I sparred with local boxers here. There are lot of talented boxers, especially girls. So, being a chief guest is something special,"" said Nikhat .

The former junior world champion in 50 kg category was an athlete before she tried her hands at boxing.

""I was interested in bodybuilding initially as my uncle was a fitness enthusiast. He taught me to train at home. I then became an athlete and won 100m, 200m, 400m, 4x100m events. But I think I was destined to be a boxer. One of my dad’s friends was a boxing coach and I often saw him training with a lot of boys. When I asked my father why there were no girls boxing with him, he told me that very few girls had the guts to take up boxing. I wanted to prove that women can be boxers and that’s how I started boxing.,"" she said.

At least initially, Nikhat just wanted to box and see where the path leads. In March 2010, she took part in the sub-junior nationals, picked up gold and then won the 'Best Boxer' award at the Nationals in Tamil Nadu.

For someone who took to the sport almost by chance, this was the spark that was needed. Since then, she has had little cause to look back, although how it all started makes for interesting listening.

“I was a stubborn kid. We had water shortage so I used to fetch water in bucket, when water tankers arrived at my grandmother's place every evening after school. I was like a tomboy. That built my physique,” said Nikhat , who despite being a professional boxer is pursuing her post-graduation studies.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ive-sparred-with-goan-boxers-they-are-eager-to-learn-nikhat/articleshow/74543081.cms

25,['9/03/2020'],Papon: Rang Barse is one iconic Holi song: Papon,"From soulful songs like Moh Moh Ke Dhaage to Jiyein Kyun and Kaun Mera, Assamese singer Papon has created a niche for himself in the world of Hindi film music. On his recent trip to Lucknow, the singer spoke about his deep connection with the city and some of his best memories of the festival of colours, Holi . Having a special connection with the city, Papon shared, “Not many people know this but my wife is from Lucknow. So this city holds a very special place in my heart. Normally, we’re so busy travelling that you don’t get to spend much time with family, but whenever I come here, it’s wonderful. Earlier when I was not so popular we would go to Hazratganj to buy some chikan or go to interior places like Aminabad, now it’s tough.” When asked about some of his favourite food in the city, Papon was perplexed, “That’s a difficult question!” After a long pause the singer answered, “I’d say probably the chaat, Tundey kebabs and of course mummy ke haath ka khaana. She’s makes nice food. She’s a very good cook.”Papon (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)The Jiyein Kyun singer who hails from Assam has grown up celebrating Holi with his family in Guwahati, listening to various types of holi songs there. Interestingly, Papon also made an album on traditional Holi songs in Assamese. “Holi back at home is so interesting. They make local colours, play with mud and all. So, Holi is very close to me. Rang Barse is one iconic Holi song in Hindi that I really enjoy,” he stated.According to him, being close to family and celebrating festivals with loved ones is something he holds very dear. He said, “On Holi, my dad would put some perfume drops, mix it with colour, so when you put it, people would smell so nice. Then he would get some jalebis and all. Also, we would make clay pits and put people in those. Those are some of my most precious memories. This Holi also I’ll be with my family in Assam.”Coming back to music, we asked the singer why not all participants of music reality shows become big names in the industry. To which Papon said, “I have never really competed in a singing competition. So I’m not from that school actually where you go for competitions and then become a name. When you come to a singing show, it’s definitely entertaining, you see lots of people watching that. Having said that, it’s a great platform for people, but it’s only a platform at the end of the day. I tell so many kids that if you come here, come for the experience and exposure. But this is not a place which will get you where you want to be eventually.” He adds, “You have to work on it later, you have to train much more. A music show is just a dot on your journey of music, it can’t be a step to stardom. Not a lot of people winning in reality shows become big names as you already know. Also, I feel the voices of the people coming to these reality shows gets too exposed, it’s to an extent where it loses its freshness. That’s why I ask kids to take the goods from these shows, go back, then get into training and be patient.” — Yashi Agarwal",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74538120,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-380824/74538120.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/music/rang-barse-is-one-iconic-holi-song-papon/articleshow/74538109.cms
26,['9/03/2020'],Deepak Dobriyal: Angrezi Medium gave Irrfan bhai and me the chance to catch up on lost time and conversations,"In 2003’s Maqbool , he played Irrfan’s henchman. In 2017, he played his neighbour in Hindi Medium, and in 2020, he will be seen as his brother in Angrezi Medium . In between these, with films like Omkara (2006), 1971 (2007) and the Tanu Weds Manu series (2011 and 2015), he gained credibility as an artiste who can pull off any character with ease. Over to Deepak Dobriyal who talks about his journey so far, why he has never asked for a role and why he loves working with Irrfan . Excerpts:It is very important for me because yes, the films that I did after Hindi Medium had a relatively niche and smaller audience, which would draw footfalls only on the basis of word of mouth. I had not done a commercial mainstream film since then. Being a part of commercial set-ups is just as important for any actor. My role in Angrezi Medium is not just long in terms of screen time, but also crucial to the story. I was getting a chance to work with Irrfan bhai all over again. In the last decade, we could have worked on so many films together, but things didn’t work out. Hindi Medium ke baad, dobara unke saath kaam karne ka chance meri sabse badi lalach thi. Our tuning had worked out so well in Hindi Medium; I was getting a chance to enhance it further. We had a great time off camera, which is evident in the way we have enacted our scenes together. Our chemistry as brothers seems natural. Also, films like Angrezi Medium are important because while you work to enhance your career graph and impress your existing audience, you also have to find inroads into the hearts of the younger generation. I’ve done so many characters, but youngsters don’t remember what I did before Tanu Weds Manu Returns. You have to make yourself accessible to the young generation of audience with the kind of work that they can appreciate. If you think that unko cute ke chakkar mein kuch bhi thama denge toh chalega, you’re wrong. They’re intelligent and discerning.I was his henchman in Maqbool (2003), which was a small role. Irrfan bhai cared for me even back then. I remember, there was a patch when I fell ill. I reported to work despite having a fever and he figured that. He got me a three-day break and kept a tab on my health. A gesture like that can never be forgotten. I had promised myself that I will always be there for him, come what may. After that, we stayed in touch and met a few times as well. He loved my work and I loved all his films. I wanted to work with him again and when Hindi Medium came by, I grabbed it. It gave Irrfan bhai and me the chance to catch up on lost time and conversations. At that time, we used to shoot all day, go swimming at night and have meals together. On the shoot, he stopped people from interfering with the way I was trying to improvise my scenes. He supported me like a brother and he subtly showed that he trusts me. That helps enhance a scene so much more. Bhai khiladi aadmi hain. He can handle anything in a scene and make it look great. Iss baar, Angrezi Medium shoot karte waqt hum Thames ke kinaare baithte the London mein. We used to watch cricket together. All of us on the set made sure that we keep the atmosphere light and fun. When he would come on the set, we would first make him laugh and feel at ease, and then start work. Irrfan bhai’s enthusiasm kept the spirit of the team really high.I can’t believe it’s been that long! In these years, I never went around asking for work. I continue to audition for roles. The reason I never asked for work is that I always thought, ‘What if there is someone who can do the part better?’ By asking for that role, I am being unfair to that actor. And after asking for it, if I don’t do it well, it would be grave injustice to the role and to the person jiska mauka meri wajah se kho gaya. That’s the reason I don’t even approach my writer friends because I don’t want them to work with a bias. I’ve always worked with the mindset that if I deserve something, it will come to me on merit. That has earned me respect. Mohtaaji ka to angle hi nahi rakha maine. That’s why it took me a long time to get this far. I’ve always worked with the intention of being able to do something different and doing it really well. I don’t just want to be seen in a film. When you work with that in mind, it shows. In my downtime, I introspect and go back to Omkara. I always try to remind myself what it was about that role that worked for me. Also, I’ve learnt that to be able to play different roles and break out of your comfort zone, you have to keep learning new things. A footballer and a chess player have their energies in different places. You have to know kiski energy ko kahan channelise karna hai. Acting is like yog sadhana, you have to surrender to it, for it to work for you.Everyone is an actor in front of the camera, koi category nahi hoti hai. Accha idea, aur acchi performance koi bhi kar sakta hai. Character actors are called so because their dedication to a role is way higher. The first condition for anyone to be an actor is that they have to become a character. I find the term supporting actor or character actor derogatory. Sapne har actor ke bade hi hote hain, par haqeeqat har kisiki alag hoti hai. You could be a great actor, but you probably don’t fit into every mould. No one invests money in an actor who will not be able to draw an audience to the theatre on his own, right? I didn’t have that guarantee in those early days, but I had the promise of a good performance. Even when I had a small role, I did it like it was the central character. It takes years to find your ground in this business. Once you find it, you will fly.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74537954,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-75148/74537954.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/deepak-dobriyal-angrezi-medium-gave-irrfan-bhai-and-me-the-chance-to-catch-up-on-lost-time-and-conversations/articleshow/74537893.cms

A dash of dramatic music

The Syndicate of Seducers was recently staged at the Sri Ram Centre for Art & Culture

When desi met videshi elements

Solo pianist, Spanish music with English dialogues and lots of dramatic situations brought alive the elements of the Spanish zarzuela – The Syndicate of Seducers – recently staged at the Sri Ram Centre for Art & Culture.Spanish Ambassador José Ramon Barañano, who was accompanied by his wife Ana Garcia de Barañano, said, ""I was very pleasantly surprised to see how smoothly they were able to perform this otherwise complicated, fast-paced zarzuela (originally composed in 1910 by José Serrano, a popular Spanish composer). In Spain , this zarzuela is performed with the whole orchestra, so it was really exciting to see how it was played out to the Indian audience with just one piano and around 30 choir singers.""

Because of this, it found usage in religious celebrations – including Holi – in the early 11th and 12th centuries. Over time, the usage was restricted to Holi and diminished from other festivals.Bollywood has used bhang – whether as an accessory or in the song lyrics itself – to depict Holi revelry for decades now.

Senior ladies hit the sands....

Holding a placard with a positive message

It didn’t matter where you came from and what you did. A sea of happy women took over Juhu Beach on the weekend, they were dressed in tracks and tees and wore their enthusiasm on their sleeves. The reason was a special 10-km run to commemorate March 8, International Women’s Day and this time they got Mumbai’s fit-savvy grandmas to join them as well.Close to 400 women gathered at Juhu at the crack of dawn, which included 150 grandmothers. Also present was runner Milind Soman ’s 80-year-old mother Usha Soman , and his sister Netra. The group began with a round of belly dancing to some pulsating music as a warm-up. They then headed to the starting point with placards in hand and shouting slogans to cheer each other on. “The run, which is always for fitness , included grandmothers, too, this year.And they ran so well! We even had 90 and 94-year-olds with us,” says Prochy Master, a teacher. “It was a triple celebration as it also marked the anniversary of this women runners’ group,” she added.Anjali Bhojane, a doctor based in Andheri, found the run for fitness quite relevant at a time when the world is gripped by the fear of coronavirus. “It was inspiring to run with all these ladies at the marathon . Often, we see women saying they have no to time to exercise, but that is wrong. It is a must to take out 45-minutes a day to exercise as it increases stamina and lung capacity for better breathing. And this is so important at this time when the risk of coronavirus is so high.”After almost an hour, the runners learnt a few techniques on how to use a foam roller and also tried learning a few self-defence moves.

35,['9/03/2020'],"Badhaai Ho is back, this time as Badhaai Do","After the National Award-winning blockbuster Badhaai Ho Junglee Pictures brings the second part of this franchise titled, Badhaai Do. As the name suggests, Badhaai Do is a family comedy that revolves around an unlikely relationship and promises double the fun and emotions. While the story and characters of Badhaai Do are different from that of Badhaai Ho, there is an endearing common theme between both the films. Helmed by prolific ad filmmaker and director of Hunterrr (2015), Harshavardhan Kulkarni , the film will bring on the screen the fresh pairing of National Award-winning actor Rajkummar Rao and powerhouse performer Bhumi Pednekar . Rajkummar plays the role of a Delhi cop, who is the only male police officer in a mahila thana, while Bhumi plays the role of a school PT teacher, much to her family’s stress. Unlike each other, yet made for each other, the film is the about the goof-ups that follow when they meet and their lives intertwine in more than one way.Director Harshavardhan Kulkarni says, “I have always admired the kind of films that Junglee Pictures has made, so when they came to me with this social comedy, I was instantly on board. Just like the delightful Badhaai Ho, the milieu of this film remains the same, but with a fresh set of characters and a completely new, zanier situation.”Akshat Ghildial, who wrote Badhaai Ho and won awards for its crackling dialogues, is penning this one too, along with Suman Adhikary whom the idea originally came from. Akshat said, “Suman came up with this interesting idea, and since I have a great relationship with Junglee, I shared it with them. They liked it immediately. And then, Harsh came on board. We had great fun developing it and hope that the audience has an equally good time watching it.”Talking about her role, Bhumi says, “Badhaai Ho is one of my favourite films in recent times, and it is really exciting to take this franchise forward. For me, the script is one of the best that I have ever come across, and I immediately wanted to do this film. My character again is strong, independent and author-backed, and it gives me a lot of scope to bring a very different and cool character to life. This time, too, the film will say something extremely relevant and relatable, but in a hilarious manner. I’m also excited to share screen space with Raj for the first time” Rajkummar adds, “I have played a cop before, but never with this perspective. I look for layered characters and this is a perfect match. My character is surrounded by strong women at home and work, and that adds immense depth to his personality. Junglee Pictures’ Bareilly Ki Barfi was a fabulous experience for me. Badhaai Do is a reunion in many ways.”Amrita Pandey, CEO, Junglee Pictures, said, “Junglee Pictures believes in telling rooted Indian stories that not only entertain you, but also move you in many ways. Badhaai Ho was just that for us. And that being a high-concept comedy, it was logical for us to expand the canvas to tell more such stories. Cultivating the right synergy on films like these is the key, and with Akshat and Suman’s writing and Harsh’s vision, Badhaai Do is really one of the best stories for us to tell.” The film is all set to go on floors in June and to release by early next year.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74539179,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-68503/74539179.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/badhaai-ho-is-back-this-time-as-badhaai-do/articleshow/74539136.cms

From soulful songs like Moh Moh Ke Dhaage to Jiyein Kyun and Kaun Mera, Assamese singer Papon has created a niche for himself in the world of Hindi film music. On his recent trip to Lucknow, the singer spoke about his deep connection with the city and some of his best memories of the festival of colours, Holi .Having a special connection with the city, Papon shared, “Not many people know this but my wife is from Lucknow. So this city holds a very special place in my heart. Normally, we’re so busy travelling that you don’t get to spend much time with family, but whenever I come here, it’s wonderful. Earlier when I was not so popular we would go to Hazratganj to buy some chikan or go to interior places like Aminabad, now it’s tough.” When asked about some of his favourite food in the city, Papon was perplexed, “That’s a difficult question!” After a long pause the singer answered, “I’d say probably the chaat, Tundey kebabs and of course mummy ke haath ka khaana. She’s makes nice food. She’s a very good cook.”Papon (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)The Jiyein Kyun singer who hails from Assam has grown up celebrating Holi with his family in Guwahati, listening to various types of holi songs there. Interestingly, Papon also made an album on traditional Holi songs in Assamese. “Holi back at home is so interesting. They make local colours, play with mud and all. So, Holi is very close to me. Rang Barse is one iconic Holi song in Hindi that I really enjoy,” he stated.According to him, being close to family and celebrating festivals with loved ones is something he holds very dear. He said, “On Holi, my dad would put some perfume drops, mix it with colour, so when you put it, people would smell so nice. Then he would get some jalebis and all. Also, we would make clay pits and put people in those. Those are some of my most precious memories. This Holi also I’ll be with my family in Assam.”Coming back to music, we asked the singer why not all participants of music reality shows become big names in the industry. To which Papon said, “I have never really competed in a singing competition. So I’m not from that school actually where you go for competitions and then become a name. When you come to a singing show, it’s definitely entertaining, you see lots of people watching that. Having said that, it’s a great platform for people, but it’s only a platform at the end of the day. I tell so many kids that if you come here, come for the experience and exposure. But this is not a place which will get you where you want to be eventually.” He adds, “You have to work on it later, you have to train much more. A music show is just a dot on your journey of music, it can’t be a step to stardom. Not a lot of people winning in reality shows become big names as you already know. Also, I feel the voices of the people coming to these reality shows gets too exposed, it’s to an extent where it loses its freshness.

40,['9/03/2020'],Jammu and Kashmir delimitation likely to give more political heft to Jammu,"NEW DELHI: The Centre has decided to complete the delimitation exercise in Jammu and Kashmir within a year which is likely to tilt the balance of power towards Jammu region with more MLAs than Kashmir in the Union Territory’s legislature.On Friday, the Centre had notified constitution of the delimitation commission headed by former Supreme Court judge Justice Ranjana Desai to redraw the assembly and parliamentary constituencies of J&K as per the J&K Reorganisation Act, 2019. After abrogation of Article 370 on August 5 last year, the erstwhile state was carved into two separate UTs of J&K and Ladakh, the former with a legislature.According to the J&K Reorganisation Act, seven seats are to be added to the present 85 in J&K. PoK with 24 allotted seats will remain untouched in the delimitation exercise, top sources said. At present, Kashmir region has 46 seats and Jammu 37, besides two nominated members.The delimitation commission, which will simultaneously undertake a similar exercise in the four north-eastern states of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh , Nagaland and Manipur, will distribute assembly constituencies as per the 2011 Census. According to sources, the Jammu region, which saw largescale migration from the militancy-hit Kashmir since the 1990s, will have more representatives in the new legislature.Hindu-dominated Jammu region saw an influx of both Muslim and Hindus fleeing the Valley after armed militancy broke out in 1989. However, if more seats are allotted to the Jammu region based on population, each constituency will have a mix of voters unlike Kashmir. The last delimitation exercise in J&K was carried out in 1995.The 24 seats in PoK will not be considered in “reckoning the total membership of the assembly” and it will remain vacant and will be excluded in the delimiting exercise.

41,['9/03/2020'],Rana Kapoor’s secretary negotiated ‘kickback’ with DHFL: ED,"MUMBAI: Rana Kapoor’s remand application submitted by the ED to the holiday court on Sunday mentioned that his secretary had coordinated with officials of the scam-tainted DHFL for a Rs 600-crore loan, believed to be a kickback, in DOIT Urban Ventures , a firm controlled by the Yes Bank founder’s three daughters. As per ED, the kickback was in lieu of a Rs 4,450-crore debenture investment and loan sanctioned by Yes Bank to DHFL group companies.ED sources alleged that Kapoor misused his position in Yes Bank in several other cases too and received over Rs 2,000 crore in kickbacks for companies controlled by him or his family members. ED and the income tax department intensified their investigation against the Kapoors after the CBI registered a case against them. ED stated that just before the sanctioning of a Rs 600-crore loan, Yes Bank invested Rs 3,700 crore in short-term debentures in DHFL between April-June 2018. Yes Bank further gave a Rs 750 crore loan to another DHFL group company. Rajendra Mirashie , president (project finance), DHFL, said in his statement to ED that DOIT Urban Ventures gave five properties as collateral to DHFL with a valuation of Rs 735 crore. But it was found that the purchase price of the properties (agricultural land in Alibaug and Raigad) was just Rs 40 crore.Mirashie stated he never interacted with Kapoor’s three daughters but would coordinate with Lata Dave , Rana Kapoor’s senior executive secretary. Kapil Wadhawan of DHFL or his assistant S Govindan used to give Mirashie instructions for the transactions. Mirashie told ED that though there was no business activity or revenue visible in DOIT Urban Ventures, yet the Rs 600 crore loan to it was structured in such a way that the principal was to be paid in 2023 (after five years) in a single bullet payment, but till now only the interest is being serviced.Kapoor’s daughters Roshini Kapoor, Radha Kapoor Khanna and Raakhee Kapoor Tandon are 100 % shareholders of DOIT Urban Ventures through Morgan Credits. In her statement to ED, Radha said that in addition to mortgaged properties, she had also given her personal guarantee to DHFL.In his statement to ED, Rana Kapoor said he believed that property mortgage, securities and monetization of various investments of DOIT Urban Ventures would be able to cover the loan risk and repayment of loans on the due date for DHFL. Kapoor told ED officials that out of Yes Bank’s Rs 750-crore loan to Belief Realtors (controlled by the Wadhawan brothers), DHFL in turn loaned Rs 450 crore to builders Radius Group and Paresh Shah Grou. They in turn paid Rs 450 crore to Yes Bank to repay their loans. Kapoor refused to divulge to ED further details of this transaction. Sonpal Jain, CA at RKW Developers (again, controlled by the Wadhawans) told ED about the Rs 750-crore flow.He said Belief Realtors took the loan for an SRA redevelopment project at Bandra Reclamation. But they immediately transferred the money into KYTA Advisors through three other group companies. KYTA then transferred the amount to RIP Developers, which then transferred it to DHFL. All these firms were controlled by the Wadhawans.ED’s special counsel Sunil Gonsalves submitted to the court on Sunday that “deposits of public money were used to purchase loans of Rs 3,700 crore”. “To camouflage it, a loan of Rs 600 crore is shown. The entire proceeds of crime are Rs 4,300 crore. These loans are given to a firm called DOIT Urban Ventures where Kapoor is the founder and his daughters are beneficiaries. They are 100% shareholders in the firm,” Gonsalves said, adding that public money from Yes Bank has gone to DHFL and family companies and this needed to be inquired into.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74543387,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1579925,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rana-kapoors-secretary-negotiated-kickback-with-dhfl-ed/articleshow/74543383.cms
42,['9/03/2020'],7 states saw drop in rainfall in last 30 years,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Seven states — Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal , Himachal Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Nagaland — have shown “significant decreasing trends” in annual rainfall in the last 30 years and many parts of the country witnessed increase in number of “dry days” during the monsoon season which adversely affected groundwater recharges in these regions.

These are some of the key findings of a report, ‘Observed Rainfall Variability and Changes’, which was shared by the ministry of earth sciences (MoES) with a parliamentary panel in response to the latter’s queries on changing rainfall patterns in the context of its impact on agriculture.

The ministry compiled the report by analysing rainfall pattern over 28 states and the Union Territory of J&K based on data of the last 30 years (1989-2018).

The report said the situation for agriculture or water recharge in certain states in the Ganga river basin (UP, Bihar and West Bengal), Delhi and some southern states was “alarming”, as the number of dry days (daily rainfall of 2.5 mm or less) during the south-west monsoon was “significantly increasing”.

Asked about the reason behind change in rainfall pattern in those states, MoES secretary Madhavan Rajeevan said, “It could be attributed to climate change. Global warming is happening and it has impacted the climate in India as well. As a result, many parts of the country have seen decreasing trends while others witnessed increasing trends.”

He told TOI on Sunday that the study was conducted as desired by the parliamentary committee when many members during its last meeting in September 2019 raised concerns about changing rainfall pattern in their constituencies/states.

“Such study may help farmers plan their agricultural activities and conserve/utilise available water resources,” Rajeevan said.

The parliamentary standing committee on science & technology and environment, headed by Congress’s Rajya Sabha member and former Union minister Jairam Ramesh , submitted its report to Parliament on Friday.

“Five states, viz Bihar, Meghalaya, Nagaland, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, have shown statistically significant decreasing trends in south-west monsoon rainfall. These five states, along with two more states — Arunachal Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh — have also shown statistically significant decreasing trends in annual rainfall,” the report said, referring to details shared by the MoES secretary with the committee.

“However, in district rainfall, significant changes have been noticed for most of the states,” it said.

The report said the frequency of rainfall of lower intensity (less than 7 cm), favourable for soil and ground water recharge, was decreasing in these regions. Overall, there was significant changes in the frequency of dry days, rainy days (daily rainfall of 2.5 mm or more but less than 7 cm) and heavy rainfall events (rainfall greater than equal to 7 cm) in different parts of the country.

As part of its recommendations, the committee urged the MoES to explore “monetisation of data and information” generated through a well-thought out policy, which does not compromise the public interest nature of its original mandate.

“Although the ministry is carrying out a public service, if the data is utilised by private users, especially large entities like private insurance companies, such private users must pay commensurately for the data and information provided by the ministry,” the panel said.

It said such a policy would help the ministry generate additional resources for augmenting important programmes and also help it, to some extent, to tide over the financial crunch that it faces every year in financing its projects/schemes.

43,['9/03/2020'],Climate change could put 4.5% of India’s GDP at risk: Study,"KOLKATA: Climate change and global warming may hit India’s GDP within a decade, a report published by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) has said.

By 2030, temperatures in India could reach such levels that outdoor workers may be forced to cut short their daylight working hours to beat the lethal heat waves, the report says.

The MGI report has estimated that the impact of global heating on outdoor work and the resultant loss in productivity could put 2.5% to 4.5% of India’s GDP at risk annually.

“As of 2017, in India, heat-exposed work produces about 50% of GDP, drives about 30% of GDP growth, and employs about 75% of the labour force, some 380 million people,” the report says.

For adaptation in the short term, India can focus on early-warning systems and cooling shelters to protect those without airconditioning. “Working hours for outdoor workers could be shifted, and... at the extreme, coordinated movement of people and capital from high-risk areas could be organized,” the report suggests.

Unless there is an effective adaptation response and de-carbonization within 10 years, 16-20 crore people in India could live in regions exposed to lethal heat waves every year.

In such an eventuality, temperature could exceed the survivability threshold in many areas, with just 4-5 hours of outdoor exposure turning fatal for a healthy, well-hydrated human at rest in shade, the report says.

By 2050, several pockets in India and Pakistan are projected to experience more than 60% annual chance of such heat waves. Such is the seriousness of the issue that the report suggests organized mass climate migration as one of the adaptive measures.

“Reducing exposure in high-risk areas could be one means by which to manage risk, as is being considered today in various flood-prone regions,” Mekala Krishnan , one of the authors of the report, told TOI.

The sectors at greater risk include agriculture, mining, and quarrying, as also indoor sectors with poor AC penetration, like hospitality, transport, and manufacturing. The urban poor, too, are likely to be affected disproportionately.

Heat and humidity could affect labour productivity, “with workers needing to take more breaks and the human body naturally limiting its efforts to prevent over-exertion,” the report says.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s social media accounts buzzed on Sunday with stories of empowerment as seven women achievers steered the discourse, taking millions of his followers on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook through their empowering journey of overcoming the odds to emerge as changemakers.To mark International Women’s Day, the PM signed off from all his social media accounts and handed them over to the women achievers for the day.The women articulated their views on subjects as diverse as hunger, sanitation, sustainable development for water conservation, disability and inclusion, and financial empowerment by building capacity of women in traditional crafts and farming. Apart from the large number of retweets, shares and comments, some of the achievers who are on social media accounts witnessed a steep rise in the number of followers.The seven achievers included Food Bank India founder Sneha Mohandoss , bomb blast survivor and disability rights activist Malvika Iyer, young entrepreneur Arifa Jan who works with women artisans to revive traditional crafts in Kashmir, water champion Kalpana Ramesh who uses sustainable design to combat water shortage, Vijaya Pawar who has been working for two decades to promote handicrafts of Banjara women in Maharashtra, Kalavati Devi of Kanpur who collected money to build toilets and Veena Devi of Munger in Bihar who started mushroom farming from her home.Arifa Jan, Veena Devi and Kalavati Devi were also conferred with the Nari Shakti Puraskar by President Ram Nath Kovind on Sunday.In the morning, Modi took to Twitter to say, “India has outstanding woman achievers in all parts of the nation. These women have done great work in a wide range of sectors. Their struggles and aspirations motivate millions. Let us keep celebrating the achievements of such women and learning from them.”He also greeted everyone on International Women’s Day. “We salute the spirit and accomplishments of our Nari Shakti. As I’d said a few days ago, I’m signing off. Through the day, seven women achievers will share their life journeys and perhaps interact with you through my social media accounts,” he tweeted.Mohandoss from Food Bank India was the first to tweet. “You heard of food for thought. Now, it is time for action and a better future for our poor. We have over 20 chapters and have impacted several people with our work. We also initiated activities like mass cooking, cooking marathons, breast feeding awareness drives,” the Chennai-based Mohandoss tweeted.Iyer said she survived a bomb blast at the age of 13 which blew off her hands and severely damaged her legs. “I worked and went on to do a PhD. Giving up is never an option,” she tweeted. She highlight how education was indispensable for change. “We need to show people with disabilities as role models instead of showing them as weak and dependent,” she said. Iyer also spoke of accessibility and the need to focus on invisible disabilities like mental illness.Arifa Jan from Kashmir tweeted, “I always dreamt of reviving the traditional crafts of Kashmir because this is a means to empower local women. I saw the condition of women artisans and so I began working to revive Numdha craft.”Ramesh from Hyderabad narrated her story of coping with constant water shortage and dependence on tankers to using her knowledge of architecture to create a sustainable home first and then help society to save water through sustainable design solutions. “Small efforts can make a big impact. Water is a valuable inheritance. Let us not deprive our next generations,” she tweeted and called upon people to be “water warriors”.Pawar tweeted, “You have heard about handicrafts from different parts of India. My fellow Indians, I present to you handicrafts of the Banjara community in rural Maharashtra. I have been working on this for the last two decades and have been assisted by a thousand more women.”Kalavati Devi from Sitapur, a mason, constructed over 4,000 toilets in villages of Kanpur. She said she went from house to house for contributions and asked people to join in building toilets and cleaning up their neighbourhoods.Veena Devi, known as ‘Mushroom Mahila’ for popularising mushroom cultivation, said she started in a small way from her house.

Thursday’s moratorium was preceded by withdrawals of bulk deposits following a downgrade in December 2019 itself. On Saturday, the bank also saw heavy retail withdrawals as it was plugged back into the interbank ATM network. Following this development, depositors could withdraw from any ATM in the country.Traditionally, Yes Bank has been heavily dependent on bulk deposits. Only 40% of its deposit base is understood to have come from retail investors. While the bulk depositors cannot get out now because of the moratorium, they will be free to do so once the moratorium is lifted.Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a statement on Sunday that concerns raised in sections of the media on safety of deposits in certain banks is based on an analysis that is flawed. “Solvency of banks is internationally based on capital to risk weighted assets and not on market capitalisation. The RBI closely monitors all banks and assures depositors that there is no such concern of safety of deposits in any bank,” the RBI said.Banking sources said that liquidity was not going to be a problem as the RBI would provide a liquidity facility to the bank given present circumstances. The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam had withdrawn Rs 1,300 crore from Yes Bank in October 2019, while the Vadodara Smart City Development had withdrawn its deposits of around Rs 265 crore just days before the moratorium was imposed. An undertaking of the Maharashtra government too had withdrawn deposits from the private lender.The bank’s advances at Rs 2.2 lakh crore as of end September were already higher than the deposit base (see graphic). The difference was funded by borrowings, including over $1 billion of foreign currency debt. Stemming the outflow of deposits would be a key challenge for the new management of the bank.In the past, whenever a moratorium was imposed on a private bank, the failed bank was always merged with a public sector bank. This helped restore confidence as, with the re-branding, customers felt their deposits were guaranteed by the government.In the case of Yes Bank, although SBI is coming in as an investor, it will continue to remain a private lender. Also, there will not be any re-branding and the ‘Yes’ brand will be retained.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74545978,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-176009,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/yes-bank-saw-exit-of-bulk-deposits-before-rbi-move-a/c-safety-mcap-not-linked-says-central-bank/articleshow/74542562.cms
46,['9/03/2020'],Teachers’ body calls off strike in Bihar,"PATNA: A section of niyojit teachers of government secondary schools belonging to State Secondary Teachers’ Association called off their indefinite strike and decided to join the evaluation duty with immediate effect.

Association’s general secretary Shambhu Kumar Singh sent a letter to additional chief secretary of education department, RK Mahajan, regarding the withdrawal of their strike on March 5 after a meeting with the department officials on March 3. “The association is ready to provide full support to the state government in evaluation of answer copies. We got positive response from the education department about the raise in salary of niyojit teachers,” Shambhu said.

In response to the letter, director of secondary education, Giriyar Dayal Singh, asked the district education officers (DEOs) to depute the non-protesting teachers for the evaluation of answer copies of board examinations conducted by Bihar School Examination Board in February.

Giriyar instructed the DEOs to assign the teachers accordingly to their subject for the evaluation of answer copies of Class X examination, which has started on March 5.

Poonam Sinha, a member of the association, said the teachers’ strike would only cause trouble for children who appeared for Class X and XII examinations. “We need to complete the evaluation work on time, so that they can get admission in their desired institutes. If we delay, the students will lose time,” she told this newspaper.

The education department has deputed regular teachers of government-aided schools, Inter colleges and college teachers for evaluation duty. Even some of the retired teachers are also assisting in evaluation work.

Education minister Krishnandan Prasad Verma told this newspaper on Sunday that the department was ready to talk to protesting teachers to discuss their demands. “Teachers who return to their duty would immediately get the unpaid salary of January and February while those who are still protesting will not get their salaries. We are sure that the strike will not stay longer and they will return to work sooner or later,” he said.

“The state government is even ready to increase the pay of niyojit teachers. Earlier, they used to get Rs1,500 per month. Now, they are getting Rs30,000 per month,” he said.

The teachers have been on strike since February 17 in support of their demands, including equal pay for equal work and better service conditions. More than 74,000 schools of the state have reportedly become dysfunctional due to their strike. Moreover, they boycotted invigilation work in secondary and Intermediate examinations and were boycotting evaluation of answer books.

Expressing grave concern over the prolonged strike by schoolteachers, AIFUCTO secretary Arun Kumar said most of the schools in the state are run by contractual teachers and the fate of more than 60% students depends on their performance. If they withdraw their services from the system, the entire educational machinery of the state would go topsy-turvy, he said.

He appealed to the chief minister to intervene and save the careers of lakhs of innocent boys and girls by conceding to the genuine demands of striking teachers.

The JFME, at its national executive meeting held in New Delhi recently, also supported the demands of contractual teachers of Bihar and appealed to the state government to find an amicable settlement of their demands in the larger interest of school education.

KOLKATA: Several private hospitals in Kolkata have set up isolation wards following an instruction from the health department. As many as five government hospitals across the state have now been identified as swab-collection centres for nCoV. They will also train health employees on how to collect swabs, which will then be sent for tests at NICED and SSKM Hospital.

The hospitals to serve as swab collection units include RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, Uttar Banga Medical College and Hospital, Malda Medical College and Hospital, Murshidabad Medical College and Hospital and Midnapore Medical College and Hospital. Isolation wards have also been set up at private hospitals like RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) and AMRI Hospitals.

“AMRI Hospitals will strictly follow the health department advisory regarding setting up isolation wards at all our units along with the other guidelines suggested in the letter we received from the health department. We have already set up a waiting lounge for patients who are coming in with flu-like symptoms so that other patients at the OPD are not infected in any way,” said AMRI Hospitals CEO Rupak Barua.

“A six-bed triaging and isolation ward has been set up at RTIICS, but the majority of patients showing symptoms will be advised home isolation and conservative management at home,” said RTIICS zonal director R Venkatesh.

“If patients require ICU care, we have two beds in an isolated intensive care. The unit has dedicated ventilators and monitors apart from all necessary protective equipment.

54,['9/03/2020'],"Hike in steel, cement prices hurting realtors","At a time when Visakhapatnam is preparing itself to host the executive capital of Andhra Pradesh, the realty sector of the region was anticipating a boom. However, the spike in prices of steel and cement has significantly affected the sector’s optimism. Realtors are of the opinion that if the prices continue to go up, they will be compelled to stop under-construction projects and wait for the prices to go down.

Speaking to TOI, Koteswara Rao, a city-based realtor said, “2019 was a bad year for us. With the new government implementing a fresh sand policy, the supply of sand went down and the price of sand increased in the black market. Many projects got stalled. But finally, when sand prices came down, the price of steel and cement is affecting our business.

While a 50kg bag of cement cost Rs 225 in January, the price went up to Rs 325 per bag in mid-February. Now, the price has gone up to Rs 400 per bag. Similarly, the price of steel has increased by nearly 60 per cent over the last six months, of which, a 30 per cent hike has occurred over the last three months.

“Generally, this is the peak season for construction business. The price of cement and steel remains competitive during this time of the year. But this year is an exception and manufacturers are hiking the price of steel and cement,” Rao added.

Suppliers claimed that the price hike for steel is due to rise in prices in the international market. “As far as we are aware, steel prices have gone up globally and it has had an effect on Indian steel prices also. Owing to a lack of demand, steel prices reduced from April to September last year. Now, the demand has increased and prices of steel have also gone up,” said N Nagendra Rao, a wholesaler.

On the rising price of cement, experts said while prices were stable in southern states till the end of 2019, the price in Visakhapatnam rose this year due to high real estate demand.

“Due to the new sand policy of the state government there was shortage of sand supply and owing to this many projects were stalled in the city. As supply of sand normalised in November, realtors restarted stalled projects and demand increased by leaps and bounds,” said Nagendra Rao.

Currently, more than 5,000 flats in large complexes and 2,000 in smaller complexes are up for sale in the city and its outskirts. Many of these are still under construction.

Realtors feel that while the price of real estate is increasing in Visakhapatnam with the executive capital proposal on the table, the increase in prices might actually lessen demand, thereby damaging the hopes for a realty sector boom.

PATNA: All, it seems, is not well with the two major constituents of Bihar Mahagathbandhan – Congress and RJD – as the former on Sunday reminded Lalu’s party of a “commitment” it had made during the last Lok Sabha elections to give one Rajya Sabha seat to it.

In a letter written on Sunday, Bihar Congress incharge Shaktisinh Gohil also ruled out the possibility of his candidature for the Rajya Sabha from Bihar. He, however, reminded ally RJD of its promise to give one seat to the Congress in Rajya Sabha.

“RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav had categorically said in the joint press conference of Mahagathbandhan during Lok Sabha polls that one seat from RJD quota in Rajya Sabha will be left for Congress. Hope RJD fulfils its promise,” Gohil wrote.

On speculations about his candidature, Gohil said, “If Congress gets the promised Rajya Sabha seat, its candidate will be a leader from Bihar only. Anyone like me, who is not a voter in Bihar, will not be candidate of Congress.”

Asked about Congress’s demand for one seat, RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari said, “The RJD had not made any such commitment to Congress. RJD’s state president Jagdanand Singh had also made this clear. However, Lalu ji has been authorised to take decision on this matter,” he said.

Notification for the biennial election to Rajya Sabha was issued on March 6. According to sources, five vacancies will be created from Bihar in the Rajya Sabha following end of tenure for Harivansh, Kahkashan Perween and Ram Nath Thakur of JD(U), besides Dr C P Thakur and R K Sinha of BJP on April 9.

As per norms for election of members for Rajya Sabha, first preferential votes of 42 members of state legislative assembly are required for sending a candidate to the Upper House.

Sources said as per present strength of major political parties in Bihar assembly, BJP can send one member, while JD (U) and RJD can send two members each.

Though the Rajya Sabha biennial elections will be held on March 26, no major political party from Bihar has declared the names of its candidates so far.

BENGALURU: Following the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) order last week to begin a probe into Flipkart for abuse of its dominant position, the All India Online Vendors Association (AIOVA) has filed a caveat in the Supreme Court against the Walmart-owned e-tailer. The move by AIOVA , the group representing small e-vendors, comes in anticipation of Flipkart challenging the NCLAT order in the SC. TOI has reviewed the filing.

A caveat is a notice submitted in anticipation by a person or an entity, informing the court that another person or entity may file a lawsuit or application against them and that the court should give the caveator (the person who has filed the caveat) a fair hearing before deciding on the matter brought in front of the court.

Interestingly, soon after acquiring 77% stake in Flipkart in 2018, Walmart had also filed caveats in the Delhi HC against the RSS-affiliate Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) and Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), entities which had opposed the acquisition of the homegrown e-tailer by the US brick-and-mortar retailer.

An AIOVA spokesperson confirmed it filed the caveat on Saturday. Flipkart did not respond to a query emailed by TOI.

Food and delicacies:

PATNA: Residents of the city are all set to celebrate Holi , the festival of colours, with utmost zeal and enthusiasm. The two-day festival, which will begin with ‘Holika Dahan’ on Monday, marks the beginning of spring season. It is observed on the full-moon day of the Hindi month of Falgun.Holika Dahan will be celebrated on Monday on the eve of Holi when people will burn bonfires. As per city-based priest Shyam Upadhyay, a pyre is set up in an open area where two effigies – one of Holika and another of Prahlad – are placed. “While Holika’s effigy is made of combustible material, Prahlad’s effigy is made of non-combustible material. The day depicts the victory of good over evil as ‘Prahlad’ defeated his devil aunt ‘Holika’,” he said.Meanwhile, forest department principal secretary Dipak Kumar Singh has urged people to avoid burning non-combustible items, especially tyres and lubricants. “When burned, these non-combustible items release very toxic and harmful gases, which are bad for environment as well as health of people,” Singh said, adding people should also avoid burning bonfires near forest areas or areas surrounded by plants.In a bid to avoid wasting water, people now prefer playing dry Holi. Several communities and societies have started celebrating the festival without using water. Paltliputra Cooperative Society ’s secretary Rai Ajeet Prasad said Holi should be celebrated with fun and without harming nature. “We can only achieve a safe and harmless Holi by not using water and celebrating it with herbal and organic colours,” he said.Doctors at private and government healthcare centres have advised people to celebrate Holi without the fear of coronavirus. Patna civil surgeon Dr Raj Kishore said people don’t need to panic as there hasn’t been any confirmed case of coronavirus in the state so far. “Residents don’t need to avoid gatherings or Holi Milan events as it has nothing to do with coronavirus,” he added.From oiling the hair to applying petroleum jelly or moisturising lotion on the body, people follow several processes to protect their skin from harmful chemicals during Holi. “Some colours have very harmful chemicals which can result in breakouts, acne and even rashes. Hence it’s very important to cover the skin with a layer of moisturizer and sunscreen. Besides, coating the hair before playing Holi is very important as the colours can damage the hair,” said city-based dermatologist Ajay Kumar.The festival of colours is all about fun, rituals and mouth-watering dishes. Most people begin cooking traditional food items like ‘malpua’, ‘gujiya’, ‘ dahi vada ’ and ‘thandai’. Some start preparing Holi delicacies two-three days in advance. “Several people visit my house on the evening of Holi. Every year, apart from the traditional dishes, I try to treat them with a new food item. This time, I will serve chocolate ‘golgappa’ to my guests,” said Anita Sinha, a resident of Kankarbagh.Guv, CM greet people: Several prominent personalities extended their wishes to people on the occasion of Holi. In his message, governor Phagu Chauhan said, “I wish that the festival of colours brings prosperity, happiness, peace and joy in the lives of people across the state and a calm atmosphere prevails in the society. I also wish that the festival is celebrated with utmost brotherhood and communal harmony.”CM Nitish Kumar too hoped that the festival would bring happiness and prosperity in the lives of people. “Holi symbolises the victory of good over evil. The biggest speciality of this festival is that it is celebrated by everyone without any differences and with love and affection for each other. I appeal to people in the state to celebrate this festival with mutual love, brotherhood and social harmony,” Nitish said in a statement.Former CM Rabri Devi too extended her wishes. “Let us pledge to burn the evil inside us on Holika Dahan this year and put our lives in good deeds.

Many in the crowd who had attended some of the previous Happy Streets editions said it was a new experience altogether with the Lake Town clock tower in the backdrop. “The atmosphere is amazing. We want Happy Streets to continue and we will come again,” said a girl who had come from the nearby Bangur area.

There were also people playing football and badminton. Teens took advantage of an early morning outing and cycled along the stretch. Six-year-old Gaurika Gupta from Lake Town was excited to attend Happy Streets for the first time and promptly took to roller skating.

Several senior citizens out for their morning walk joined the Happy Streets crowd, saying it was a whole new experience.

66,['9/03/2020'],Mutual funds ask investors to change Yes Bank account mandate,"(File photo)

MUMBAI: The mutual fund ( MF ) industry has stepped in to help investors who had linked their Yes Bank accounts for payment and receipt of funds with regards to their investments with the fund houses. The industry as a whole has suspended crediting all Yes Bank accounts in case of redemptions and dividend payouts.

MFs have also stopped all systematic investment plan (SIP) mandates from investors that were to come from Yes Bank accounts till an alternative account is provided, Association of Mutual Funds in India ( Amfi ) chairman Nilesh Shah said.

These decisions were taken by the fund houses soon after the RBI imposed restrictions on the private lender on Thursday evening. “All of us didn’t pay money to Yes Bank accounts for redemptions. We were able to allot NAVs against money collected from Yes Bank till Thursday. But for future SIPs, since money won’t come from Yes Bank, we won’t be able to give them NAVs,” Shah said.

NAV, or net asset value, is the price of each unit of an MF scheme at which an investor can either invest in the fund or redeem holdings. Although Sebi rules allow MFs to accept cash investments in their schemes for up to Rs 50,000 per year, given the extra administrative hassles for such inflows, all fund houses insist on investments either through cheques or electronic payments.

An email to investors from PPFAS MF said that all purchase transactions including SIPs involving Yes Bank have been disallowed for a temporary period (one to three months) from Friday and it may also be extended further. Or, “in case of any relaxation by the RBI, we may start processing SIP transaction as well as purchase transaction”. The fund house asked its investors to route all purchase transactions through a new bank account immediately, as this would help “in minimising the dislocation in SIP programme”.

PPFAS MF also said it was withholding all payments to Yes Bank account holders from its funds for the time being and asked its investors to provide a “change of bank mandate” for all future redemptions.

These include peer-to-peer and merchant payments via UPI .Following the Yes Bank shocker, Bengaluru-based PhonePe has now initiated talks with State Bank of India (SBI) to have a multi-bank approach for UPI, two people aware of the matter said. Delhi-based BharatPe too is in talks with Kotak Mahindra Bank as well as SBI .After ICICI Bank came to the rescue on Friday, the Mumbai-based bank now is processing almost 60% of UPI transactions, as it was already working closely with Google Pay, one of the top apps on the platform. Sources also said that the National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) played a critical role in emerging out of the Yes Bank crisis in 24 hours.“NPCI was constantly monitoring the situation. Yes Bank has given a no-objection certificate to migrate user UPI handles to ICICI Bank till the moratorium is in place. Changes were done after that,” a source said.PhonePe co-founder and CEO Sameer Nigam, as part of his reply to a comment, said on Twitter, “Just never imagined the bank itself going totally dark like this. Lesson learnt in the hardest possible way.” PhonePe also took a hit on its balance sheet as it had to settle payments with merchants via the new nodal account with ICICI Bank, as the money in Yes Bank nodal account remains stuck.The amount which PhonePe had used to settle with its merchants is not known, but it is one of the largest consumer-focused UPI apps, clocking 20 million daily transactions. Nigam, whose PhonePe was hit the most, had to fly down to Mumbai on Friday morning amid one of its worst crises so far.“All our QRs are active now. It was one of the fastest migrations ever done — NPCI was working with us overnight to get this done,” said BharatPe co-founder and CEO Ashneer Grover. BharatPe had 20-30% exposure to Yes Bank for its QR codes.ICICI Bank said that it could manage to respond to the crisis at PhonePe because the bank had an application programming interface, called APIs, ready and systems tested for high-volume transactions during ‘peacetime’, and it also has fraud analytics systems in place. “The bank put together a 40-strong team of legal, operations and technology to avoid having to obtain approvals sequentially. In future, if customers want, the handles would be revised to reflect ICICI Bank domain names,” said ICICI Bank ED Anup Bagchi.Currently, PhonePe users can transact using their existing UPI IDs of Yes Bank — @ybl, as TOI reported in its Saturday edition. Kotak Mahindra Bank’s chief digital officer Deepak Sharma said it is always on the lookout for “mutually beneficial partnerships” without commenting on talks with BharatPe.

PATNA: Newspaper readers in Bihar woke up to the launch of a new political platform,‘Plurals’, on Sunday, with London School of Economics alumna Pushpam Priya Chaudhary declaring herself to be the CM candidate in the state assembly elections slated to be held later this year.Coinciding with International Women’s Day, Pushpam’s campaign seemed a bit unorthodox as far as politics in Bihar is concerned. The newspapers advertisements and her social media handles had a message in English: “Love Bihar, Hate Politics? Join the most progressive political party. Plurals has arrived. Bihar deserves better and Better is possible.” It mentions Pushpam as “president, Plurals and CM candidate Bihar 2020”.Her letter in Hindi talks about making Bihar the most developed state by 2025 and making growth rate of Bihar equal to any European country by 2030. It asks people to preserve the letter as the oath-taking document, which she would read on being elected in the upcoming elections.Pushpam hails from a political family in Darbhanga. Her father Vinod Kumar Chaudhary was a JD(U) MLC from Darbhanga graduate constituency from 2008 to 2014. Her grandfather Uma Kant Chaudhary also unsuccessfully contested the assembly elections four times from erstwhile Samata Party.Vinod said he was also the state general secretary of JD(U), but presently contesting as an independent candidate from the same Darbhanga graduate constituency.He, however, feigned ignorance about Pushpam’s decision to launch herself as the CM candidate. “She never discussed with me with clarity about such a plan. We had a conversation around a month ago that some big multinational company was offering her a job with a package of Rs8 crore per annum in London. I asked her to take it up, but she told me that she wants to do something big. She told me that I’m getting old now and should look after my health and allow her to enter electoral politics,” Vinod told TOI on Sunday.Vinod, however, did not share her contact number saying Pushpam returned to India only a five days ago and had no local cellphone number yet. He said Pushpam, in her late 20s, did her schooling in Darbhanga and graduation from Symbiosis International University , Pune.Pushpam also worked as creative head in Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation for a brief period in 2012. “Later, she did MA in Development Studies from Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex, United Kingdom (2016), followed by Master of Public Administration from London School of Economics and Political Science (2019),” Vinod said, adding that her sister Juhi is in the UK Civil Services.While Pushpam could not be contacted, she tweeted on Sunday: “Bihar needs pace, Bihar needs wings, Bihar needs change. Because Bihar deserves better and better is possible. Reject bullshit politics, join Plurals to make Bihar run and fly in 2020. #PluralsHasArrived #ProgressiveBihar2020.”In another tweet on March 6, she wrote: “Integrating Multiple Realities: My studies at LSE and IDS and also my experiences in Bihar have taught me that there cannot be a single model of development as every individual has a unique reality.”",patna,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74547790,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-480432,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lse-alumna-projects-herself-for-cms-post/articleshow/74541410.cms

Citing the court cases regarding the merger of some of the villages into neighbouring municipal towns, the state government has requested the State Election Commission (SEC) to withdraw all the 29 villages in the capital city area from the notification list.

This is a big jolt to the principal opposition TDP as it wanted to consolidate its strength by winning the local body elections in Amaravati riding on the wave of agitations by the locals.

TDP wanted to show that people are backing Amaravati as single capital city by defeating YSRC in the area.

Interestingly, YSRC won both Tadikonda and Mangalagiri assembly constituencies spread over the capital city area in the elections held eight months ago. TDP national general secretary Nara Lokesh faced humiliating defeat in his first direct electoral battle from Mangalagiri constituency. TDP was looked determined to take revenge on YSRC by sweeping the local body elections. However, its hopes were shattered when the government deferred the elections to all the villages.

The state government had earlier decided to merge five villages that were part of the capital city area in Tadepalle and Mangalagiri municipal towns. Similarly, the government wanted to set up Amaravati Municipal Corporation by merging the remaining 24 villages of the capital city.

While the high court stayed the merger of Yerrabalem, Bethapudi and Nowluru in Mangalagiri municipality and Undavalli and Penumaka villages in Tadepalle municipality, the plans of creating new municipal corporation for Amaravati were also put on hold keeping in view of ongoing cases against the shifting of the capital city.

The elections to the Tadepalle and Mangalagiri municipal bodies have also been put on hold due to the pending cases. Meanwhile, the state government had finalized the reservations for mayor posts in municipal corporations and chairpersons for municipal towns in the state.

‘Police Didi’ scheme, a brainchild of Rashmi Shukla, who is now commissioner of state intelligence, was first implemented while she was Pune CP a few years ago. Shortly after that, Shukla’s batchmate and then Nagpur police chief K Venkatesham had started ‘Buddy Cops’ programme in the city.

Under the ‘Police Didi’ scheme, a woman cop from every police station would be entrusted with the responsibility to visit women and girls hostels, education institutes and such places to befriend the inmates. The cop would also create a social media group with the women and girls as its members. The group members will be able to post their grievances, seek advise and also forward suggestions for local police stations to act.

An officer said the group members can also share their personal grievances with the woman constable. “If some personal issues are required to be addressed, our constable would be there to help,” said the officer. “This platform would shield many women and girls from becoming silent victim,” said the officer.

In similar fashion, ‘Police Kaka’ will be there to help young boys with whom they can share grievances and seek assistance in matters which they might be afraid to share with the family. “In today’s world, it’s not only women or girls, but many boys too fall victim to exploitation which they cannot share with parents or other family members,” he said.

Vadodara: Accused priest of Shri Baglamukhi Brahmastra Vidya Mandir, Dr Prashant Upadhyay, has once again sought bail from the sessions court in the case of cheating a businessman of Rs 21 lakh.

In his petition, Upadhyay has pleaded innocence in the case and claimed that the case was registered against him to tarnish his image in the society. The court took up Upadhyay’s bail plea for hearing on Saturday and asked the police to respond.

The investigating officer is likely to oppose his application through an affidavit in the next hearing which will be held on March 11.

Last month too the sessions court had denied anticipatory bail to Upadhyay, whose earlier bail application too claimed that businessman Devraj Pandya had filed a false case against him. He has also questioned the timing of the case as the offence had taken place between 2013 and 2015.

Pandya had alleged that Upadhyay had taken money for performing ceremonies at his home and factory for various reasons. Pandya had approached the priest when his business was going through difficult times. Even after taking this huge sum when Pandya’s business had not recovered, he filed a cheating case against Upadhyay.

Upadhyay is currently in Vadodara Central Jail as his custody with Gotri police ended on Saturday.

Gotri police had also arrested him after a woman had lodged a cheating plaint against him alleging that Upadhyay had taken Rs 10 lakh from her and her husband to settle their marital discord.

KOLHAPUR: The locals from Kasba Bawda , Kadamwadi have to wait for two more years to get rid of the 4 lakh tonnes of garbage at the dumping site .

The KMC is going to carry out the biomining of the garbage heap. The machinery to carry out the process has arrived and its parts will be installed soon to make it operative.

For many years, the locals have been affected by the garbage at the Kasba Bawda site, which gets approximately 160 tonnes per day. The filth and the frequent fires to the garbage mound has been the major health concerns of the locals.

The strays in the locality feed on the dumped waste and get violent many times causing fear among the locals. The locals expected the garbage mound cleared many years ago only, however, the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation ’s inability to find a feasible and sustainable solution has put them into an inconvenience for all these years.

A senior sanitation official of the KMC requesting anonymity said, “The machine is basically a segregator. The garbage will be segregated into the soil, inert waste and refuse waste. The solid will be provided to the farmers to enrich their farms as it contains high-quality nutrients. The inert waste will be dumped into the landfill sites which then will be capped. The refuse waste will be processed further and can be used as the fuel in sugar mills and other factories. We are going to spend around Rs 19.75 crore to the contractor appointed for the process. It will take around two years for biomining of the entire garbage.”

The officials claimed the application of the biosanitisers, which will help degrade the refuse waste into organic. Also, the biosanitisers will clear the filthy smell. “The contractor will make the payment as per the amount of waste cleared from the dumping site. Such a condition will ensure that the contractor carries out the work uninterruptedly. We are also going to upgrade the processing facility, set up the windrows and slurry plant to process all the daily waste collected from the city,” said the official.

AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has ruled that a sessions court’s opinion is must for commutation of life sentence under the state government’s scheme for premature release of life convicts.

The observations and directives of the HC have come while hearing a criminal writ petition filed by a convict, whose application for commutation of sentence was pending for the past six years for the need for sessions court’s opinion.

The bench comprising T V Nalawade and Justice M G Sewlikar held on March 4, said, “Ordinarily the learned sessions judge should consider such matter and he should give an opinion in this regard” while disposing of a writ petition filed by the life convict in Nashik central jail whose commutation plea was pending.

In February 2015, superintendent of Nashik Central Prison had requested the sessions court in Jalgaon for an opinion on the convict Kishor Laxman Lonari ’s plea, under the premature release scheme on completion of 14 years behind bars.

The then sessions judge wrote back to the prison authority stating that no special or separate opinion was required and the convict’s plea had to be dealt according to law.

When this communication from the court was brought to the notice of the HC, it observed: communication made by the learned Ad-hoc District Judge-2 and Assistant Sessions Judge shows that the learned Judge was not aware of the purpose for which his opinion was sought. This Court wants to observe that in such cases, the learned Sessions Judge needs to look in to the matters personally as files with regard to such opinion are generally kept in the office of Sessions Judge. Only due to non-availability of that file, it can be said that the communication for aforesaid nature was made by the learned Ad-hoc District Judge-2 and Assistant Sessions Judge.’

The high court has now directed the prison authority to send the matter again to the sessions court with a specific request for opinion within seven days.

The division bench of the HC specifically ruled that ‘Consideration of such matter by the learned Sessions Judge does not require much time and we are sure that he/she hardly requires 5-10 minutes for forming opinion and for giving opinion as guidelines are already given by the State Government. On the basis of the nature of offence only opinion is required to be given as to in which category the prisoner can be placed. It appears that only due to aforesaid confusion, the matter of the present petitioner was not decided for more than 6 years.’

78,['9/03/2020'],Inadequate bus service keeps children away from school,"Coimbatore: Unlike other students of the Government higher secondary school at Sundakkamuthur, M Manoj , 15 , has not been regular to school .

He misses classes at least twice or thrice a week as he does not manage to catch the 8’o clock government bus that plies between his house and school.

Manoj lives at the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board’s housing unit at Malai Nagar in Kovaipudur in the city. There aren’t frequent buses connecting the spots.

“If I miss the 8’o clock bus, then I have to hire an auto, which charges exorbitant fare, wait for the next buses that reaches the housing unit an hour later or walk for a couple of kilometres to the nearest bus stop to catch a bus,” Manoj said.

“I cannot afford to hire an auto for a 7km ride and my teacher will make me kneel down in front of the entire class if I arrive late. So, I skip the school whenever I miss the bus,” he said.

Only six trips – four between 7.15am and 11.30am and two between 5.15pm and 6.45pm – are made to the housing unit.

While over 200 families are residing in the housing unit at Malai Nagar, close to 900 families are residing at Anna Nagar in Madukkarai that is located next to Malai Nagar.

Most of them are working as labourers and they catch the first bus to their workplace. Nagajothi, a resident, said most of the children skip the school upon missing the buses as they do not have anyone to drop at the school.

As the number of school dropouts was high in the region, a special school was started near the housing unit six months ago. More than 30 students are studying there, she added.

“Not just the students, even others are affected due to lack of transportation. Upon missing the buses, we have to walk to Arivozhi Nagar, which is about a kilometre away. Even though the service is better there, the number of trips is limited,” said Selvaraj, who had moved to the housing unit two years ago.

He said the situation is much worse during the evening hours as they do not have any bus service after 7pm. “Even though the nearest bus stand is just a kilometre away, the auto drivers charge a minimum of Rs 100 because of the deserted pathway. Most of us are labourers. How can we afford to pay Rs 100 just for a ride when we earn nothing more than Rs 200 to Rs 300 a day,” he said. “We are solely depended on the government bus services to go to hospitals and ration shop.”

Despite several attempts, officials of the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) were not available for comment.

80,['9/03/2020'],Plans afoot to widen roads to bus terminal,"Coimbatore: The city corporation is likely to conduct a meeting with stakeholders to develop access roads and other infrastructures around the integrated bus stand at Vellalore in the city.

“Based on the direction from district collector K Rajamani, the corporation would be conducting a meeting with the stakeholders, including officials from Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC). Following the meeting, steps will be taken to widen the access roads,” a corporation source said.

But, ideally the corporation should have conducted the meeting before floating the tender or at least before commencing the construction work of the bus stand, city-based activists opined. About a couple of months ago, state municipal administration minister SP Velumani laid the foundation stone to start the construction work. The bus stand is coming up on 60 acres near the dump yard at the cost of Rs 164.81 crore.

K Kathirmathiyon of Coimbatore Consumer Cause said, “Ideally before constructing the bus stand, the corporation should have known the number of buses that would be shifted to the integrated bus stand and how viable it is to integrate all the bus stands. Because, the high court direction states that all the buses plying to locations within 55km should start only from Gandhipuram bus stand.”

81,['9/03/2020'],Kolhapur Municipal Transport’s budgetary promises for 2019-20 remains on paper,"Representative image

KOLHAPUR: Several measures were announced in the Kolhapur Municipal Transport ( KMT ) budget for 2019-20. These measures included increasing the efficiency of the transport system and reducing losses. However, the promises remain on paper .

The budget mentioned setting up of a command and control centre at Shivaji Chowk to manage the trips of the KMT buses properly and ensure on-time arrival of the buses. Though the schedules for the buses are fixed, many times, passengers have to wait for half-an-hour for buses to arrive. This is one of the main reasons for commuters to opt for other modes of transport and, thereby resulting in lesser revenue generation of the municipal transport.

Most of the undertakings of major cities in the state have modern command and control centres. These centres help to monitor the transport service, real time tracking of the buses, improve security and safety of the passengers and manage the passenger strength to avoid congestion. At the same time, it also ensures that each bus carries sufficient number of passengers.

A senior KMT official, on the condition of anonymity, said, “Huge capital expenditure is required to set up the command and control centre. Only the idea was put up in the budget. This time, funds for the same will be allocated.”

For the centre, each bus should be equipped with the Global Positioning System (GPS) and hand-held devices connected to the main server should be provided to the ticket collectors to register the time and the number of passengers boarding in a particular bus. The centre can be upgraded further by using advanced technologies. The official said that the estimates for the all the components to be required to run the common and control centre will be worked out soon.

The KMT had also planned to increase the number of on-road buses to increase the number of passengers travelling every day. At present, around 97 buses ply on city roads every day. The assurance in the budget was to make at least 112 buses out of 121 operational on a daily basis. Currently, around 75,000 passengers travel by KMT buses which, according to the plan, was expected to touch 95,000. No special efforts were taken to increase the passenger flow this year.

82,['9/03/2020'],"Chennai: ‘Yes, canal off Radial Road is encroached’","Encroachment of the canal made the 2015 floods worse in S Kolathur

CHENNAI: Revenue department officials have confirmed encroachments in S Kolathur , off Pallavaram-Thoraipakkam 200 Feet Radial Road, based on a survey they carried out three months ago, following complaints from residents. Residents had complained that access to the radial road was cut off due to encroachments.

In a letter to the St Thomas Mount block development officer (BDO) last week, Sholinganallur tahsildar confirmed that portions of an apartment complex in S Kolathur were built encroaching on a canal.

Sources said action will be taken against the encroachers after a round of talks. The encroached portions connect the residential neighbourhood to the radial road.

More than 1,000 families reside in S Kolathur and the only way for them to reach the Radial Road as of now is through Dr Ambedkar Salai.

The survey to identify encroachments is a result of more than two years of struggle by locals, according to a resident who filed the RTI. During the 2015 floods and rains in the subsequent years, the encroachments put them through a great ordeal, which spurred them to take the matter into their own hands. “In 2015, people had to jump walls to get to the 200 Feet Road to even get relief material,” recalled A Stephen of Raja Nagar, who has been residing in the neighbourhood for more than 15 years.

If the identified encroachments are cleared, two more routes to access the Radial Road will take shape, according to the residents.

In another relief to the residents, the public works department has begun constructing a retaining wall from Narayanapuram lake to Keelkattalai lake. Officials had promised them a comprehensive flood mitigation plan.

“The water from Keelkattalai lake passes through the surplus canal and excess water from the canal floods the neighbourhood. Even last year, when there was less rain, the canal was brimming,” said J Sankar, a resident who has been petitioning the authorities seeking action. Authorities said necessary action will be taken to stop sewage being let into the surplus canal.

86,['9/03/2020'],"Karjan man files bail plea ‘by mistake’, fined Rs 5,000","Vadodara: Crying wolf cost this applicant dear for not only did he scorch his ears from the lashing he got from a miffed Karjan court, but also burned his pockets for wasting the court’s precious time by ‘abusing the process of law’!

It was a case of Dhanji Rathodiya jumping to conclusions and to pre-empt arrest, filing an anticipatory bail plea in an assault case, where he stated his innocence and expressed fears that the investigating officer may arrest him despite him not being involved in the crime.

The sessions court was shocked to learn that the case doesn’t even mention Rathodiya’s name as an accused and that the investigating officer has not even called him for questioning.

This got the court’s goat truly, and his petition seeking ‘stay on his possible arrest’ earned him the wrath of additional sessions judge A A Nanavati, who fined Rathodiya Rs5,000 for taking the court for a ride.

The case pertains to an incident of assault and criminal intimidation where three accused Jitesh Rathod, Pravin Rathod and Rajesh Vasava got into fight with Sumit Solanki and his two friends in Karjan town on February 20 over a petty issue. Jitesh and Pravin had sought anticipatory bail which was rejected by the same court on February 29. On March 2, Rathodiya sought anticipatory bail. On taking cognizance of the application, the court issued notice to the state to respond to Rathodiya’s plea on March 5.

The investigating cop – head constable Rajendrasinh Ramsinh – in an affidavit informed the court that neither Rathodiya has been named as an accused nor was he summoned for questioning as he had no connection with the case.

On hearing police’s stand, Rathodiya then requested the court to let him withdraw his bail plea stating that he had filed it by mistake.

Assistant government pleader Ramesh Gianchandani, however, objected to it and urged the court to impose heavy fine on Rathodiya.

“The court took note of the fact that Rathodiya’s application was a copy of the applications filed earlier by the two accused and his name was also handwritten with a pen on a blank space,” Gianchandani said.

The court in its order stated that Rathodiya had abused the process of law and put the entire machinery of dispensing justice into motion so it can hardly be accepted that he filed the application by mistake.

“Rathodiya is a relative of one of the accused so he may have assumed that he may also be arrested. But he had nothing to do with the case as he was not present at the time of the incident,” Rajendrasinh told TOI.

88,['9/03/2020'],‘U’khand treats only a third of total sewage generated in state’,"The 10-km long sewage line in Rispana river

NAINITAL: Uttarakhand’s 24 sewage treatment plants (STPs) are treating only a third of the sewage that the urban areas of the hill state generate each day.

To a question raised in Parliament recently, the Union government quoted the above data, adding that the hill state has a treatment capacity of only 165 million litres of sewage under the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG).

The data also mentions that the state generates 495 million litres of sewage each day and only 153 million litres of it gets treated.

While the reply, which cites data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), does not say what happens to the untreated waste amounting to 343 million litres, environmentalists said that most of it ultimately ends into rivers like Ganga, Bhagirathi, Alaknanda and Rispana.

Nainital-based environmentalist and former professor of Kumaun University Ajay Singh Rawat said, “Uttarakhand is the source of major rivers in the country such as Ganga and Yamuna. These rivers feed most of the population of northern India and are a lifeline for almost half of the country’s population. However, as the data shows, the rivers are grossly polluted by untreated sewage, as hundreds of millions of litres of waste water is flowing into these rivers.”

Several other residents also echoed similar concerns. Manish Kumar , a resident of Kandoli area of Dehradun , said that though some parts of the colony have sewage facilities, most of the waste water generated from hundreds of homes in the locality is dumped in the Rispana (a tributary of Ganga). “This is true of almost all the colonies along the river in Dehradun. Even the sewage line that is there has been laid in the middle of the river further raising suspicion that some of it must be mixing with the river water,” he said.

When compared to other Himalayan states, especially neighbouring Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand’s performance is particularly dismal in the matter of treatment of sewage. While Himachal’s urban areas produce 110 million litres of sewage daily, the state has a treatment capacity of over 114 million litres.

Uttarakhand government officials meanwhile said that though it was true that the state needs to do a lot to increase its sewage treatment capacity, many new STPs have also been opened up. “The data shows that we need to do more but it is also true that many new STPs have become functional across the state. We are further working to create more such plants,” said urban development minister and government spokesperson Madan Kaushik.

He added that there is also a possibility that the data may be old.

The Union budget allocations for various schemes under the department of rural development have been already reduced. The funds allotted to employment guarantee scheme (MGNREGA) have come down in the budget, farmers alleged.

As per the budget, Rs 61,500 crore has been allocated for the NGNREGA scheme for the year 2020-21, a more than 13% decrease from the total estimated expenditure for 2019-20, which was Rs 71,000 crore, they said.

Total number of working days should be increased to 200 from 100, so that agriculture labourers could get more days’ wage. The Kerala government is utilizing MGNREGA workers for agriculture activities too. That should be followed in Tamil Nadu also, secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association Swamimalai S Vimalnathan said at a farmers’ consultative meeting on Union budget 2020-21 held here on Saturday.

“Already thousands of agriculture labourers have lost their income as there is no proper employment in farming. The employment guarantee scheme has been helping them to a certain extent. But, the government cut the allocation for MGNREGA. This is unfair,” he alleged.

94,['9/03/2020'],20 kg rotten fish seized from shops in Pollachi destroyed,"Coimbatore: Food safety officials and fisheries officials on Sunday destroyed 20 kilograms of rotten fish kept for sale at outlets in Pollachi.

The officials have been conducting inspections at fish stalls in the district to curb the sale of formalin-laced fish. On Sunday, they inspected 12 wholesale and retail fish outlets at Thernilayam, Market Road and New Scheme Road in the Pollachi taluk.

They seized 20 kilograms of rotten fish from four shops and destroyed it by pouring phenyl over it. The shopkeepers were served warning notices and were instructed to sell only fresh fish and to discard waste immediately.

The officials fined a shopkeeper 2,000 after finding banned single-use polythene carry bags in the shop.

However, they could not find formalin-laced fish.

Seventy kilograms of formalin-laced fish and 430 kilograms of stale fish were destroyed last week after the officials conducted a raid at the Ukkadam fish market in the city.

95,['9/03/2020'],Chennai: Saplings along Maduravoyal bypass under threat,"Waste, which is also a fire hazard, hampers growth of sapling

CHENNAI: The forest department’s plans to make the Maduravoyal bypass road a shady avenue are being stunted like the saplings it has planted. A total of 22,000 saplings were planted on both sides of the road for a distance of 32.6km between Perungalathur and Puzhal in October and November.

Most of the saplings survived and thrived, for a while. Now they are being threatened by piles of garbage and wild undergrowth. Worse, the wire mesh of the tree guards that protect them has been stolen.

Social forestry division forest officer S Shanmugam told the TOI that the growth of the saplings had slowed because of these problems.

A visit to the area on Saturday revealed that besides these three problems, a host of other issues too posed a threat to the saplings. For example, there were several stretches blackened by fire, apparently caused by a carelessly thrown cigarette stub. Forest officials said people also dumped domestic waste packed in black bin bags, which caught fire easily.

Shanmugham says the problem on the Perungalathur to Maduravoyal strech is different. “Here it is the wild growth of bushes, which need to be cleared by the National Highways Authority of India . As the plants were raised on the edges of the highway, watering them and replacing a damaged sapling becomes a risky job,” he said.

Fires break out or are set off by vandals not only on the sides of the road, but also on the road median. The NHAI has no facility to extinguish these fires. Patrol vehicles of the NHAI carry water in plastic pots, which is not sufficient to put out a fire, said an official.

The NHAI should install awareness boards every half km along the entire stretch, where the saplings have been planted, said the official, adding that the patrol vehicles should be equipped with fire extinguishers and personnel trained to use them should be on duty.

Forest officials point that these trees will not only provide welcome shade when fully grown, but also cut pollution.

96,['9/03/2020'],Plea to regularise ad hoc staff at BDU constituent colleges,"Trichy: The Association of University Teachers ( AUT ) observed a fast in Trichy on Sunday demanding regularisation of the services of teaching and non-teaching staff in Bharathidasan University’s 10 constituent colleges.

The AUT also demanded that the Tamil Nadu government and the BDU allow ad hoc teachers to pursue PhD and also to guide research scholars. The association demanded UGC pay scale for these teachers.

Only 31 regular teachers have been recruited since the establishment of these colleges, starting 2006. There are 10 constituent colleges including four recently converted into government colleges.

“UGC regulations mandates that not more than 20% of the sanctioned strength shall be filled with ad hoc teachers. However, all the six constituent colleges don’t have a single regular teacher and are run with only ad hoc teachers,” said N Pasupathy, AUT president.

He added that UGC guidelines fixes Rs 25,000 as monthly consolidated pay for ad hoc teachers, which was subsequently modified to Rs 50,000 in 7th UGC scales of pay.

The university has not adopted either so far while the university has chosen to appoint ‘hourly-basis lecturers’ to exploit them further.

“While they are entitled for UGC pay scale, 363 guest lecturers, 214 hourly-basis teachers and around 100 odd PTA teachers are running the college by getting a maximum salary of Rs 12,000. The salary starts at Rs 5,000,” said AUT general secretary M S Balamurugan.

Also, there was a delay on the part of the university to disburse the salary every month, he said. No service rules had been framed in the last 15 years to cater to the needs of the staff, he added.

The varsity was rated grade ‘A’ by NAAC in 2016. NAAC is an autonomous body funded by the University Grants Commission that assesses and accredits all higher education institutions in the country.

As part of preparations, university’s faculty of family and community sciences (FFCS) and Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) organized a workshop on Saturday titled ‘NAAC 2021-data analysis’ in which all teaching and non-teaching staff were involved.

The workshop aims to consolidate data of all the seven NAAC criteria and to check for any discrepancies. MSU vice-chancellor Prof Parimal Vyas emphasized on the seriousness of the workshop requesting attendance of all members.

He asked teachers to have at least two publications in a year in recognized journals while urging heads and senior teachers to guide the younger staff members.

“SCOPUS list of journals must be available with each teacher. We need to nurture a research culture,” he said, adding that the university needs to work six months in advance unlike the past where NAAC assessment remained overdue for 18 months.

Vyas further urged each teacher to be responsible for supplying relevant data.

“It is not just the responsibility of the IQAC or annual report team,” he added.

99,['9/03/2020'],Resurrecting Lucknow tehzeeb: Wait for book by ‘encyclopedia of Awadh’,"LUCKNOW: The slow, silent decay of the Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb , the Awadhi ethos upholding a distinctive, syncretic Hindu-Muslim culture, would soon be part of a new autobiography to be penned by Lucknow chronicler and Padma awardee Yogesh Parveen.

Often referred to as the ‘encyclopedia of Avadh’, Praveen will write about the soul of Lucknow, which has “lost its character due to politics of polarization”. “The city was once soaked in Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb... Unity in diversity was its essence. Communal harmony was the soul of Lucknow,” Parveen told TOI on sidelines of an event in his honour, ‘Lucknow ke gaurav’.

He said: “Lucknow was the best cosmopolitan city of the world. A P Sen was a Bengali, while Amritlal Nagar was a Gujarati. They lived for Lucknow and died for Lucknow. Today, it's painful to see witness the city caught in a pluralistic phenomena, which is being badly misused. The younger generation is mehroom (deprived) from 'pehle-aap' (after you, please) culture, tehzeeb (etiquette) and the communal amity that once characterized the city... If people imbibe these values, all hostility and conflict would end.”

“Through my book, I will aim to change the mindset of the young generation, which is drawn towards commercialisation while spurning traditional religious beliefs and spirituality,” he said.

Talking about the Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb, he said: “Be it India or Lucknow as a whole, communal harmony has lost its sheen. ‘Lucknow sisak raha hai, heritage tabah ho rahi hai, sauhard mar chuka hai' (Lucknow is crying, heritage is being destroyed and harmony exists no more). In the past, people respected each other’s religious sentiments... It's one of the basic fundamental principles. Secularism was the fulcrum. Unfortunately, ab who manobhaav nahi hai. (Now, those sentiments are absent) Everybody is self-centred and do not believe in brotherhood.”

“Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb was an amalgamation of the rose of Persia and lotus of India. Be it during Partition or Babri demolition, Lucknow set an example of harmony. We never heard of communal riots in the city and people lived happily together. Now, leaders are polarising people and Lucknow is losing its character. This is the opposite of the idea of Lucknow we cherished,"" said Praveen, who has already penned 20 books on Lucknow and contributed to Bollywood films like Satyajit Ray’s 'Shatranj Ke Khiladi' and Shyam Benegal 's 'Junoon', which were shot in the state capital.

PRAYAGRAJ: UP’s liquor mafia now has a new trick up its sleeve to dodge cops — hiding consignments in boxes of junk.

Police came to know about their modus operandi after Special Task Force (STF) recently seized a consignment of illegal liquor worth Rs 75 lakh in Amethi district .

Additional SP (STF) Neeraj Kumar Pandey said, “Liquor smugglers are focussing on delivering consignments from from Bhatinda in Punjab in Bihar after passing through UP. Cartons of liquor are hidden in junk to evade police suspicion.”

“During a checking drive on March 7, STF (Prayagraj unit) intercepted two trucks near Mohanganj in Amethi’s Jagdishpur Road. They were found to be loaded with junk,” he added.

However, as the police went though the junk, they were surprised to find illegal liquor hidden inside containers.

Police seized two trucks which were carrying 827 cartons of illegal liquor and arrested three truck drivers. The accused were identified as Lakhvinder Singh, Jagdish Singh and Pipal Singh.

Earlier while cracking down on liquor mafia, the STF had hit a wall after it failed to get information about Punjab-based smugglers. The truck drivers it arrested with illegal alcohol units weren’t told about the location of delivery.

“The truckers were given ‘code words’ and they were supposed to say them when their contact person would call them with information about the location. The drivers were told the location of delivery only if they knew the code word,” said police.

101,['9/03/2020'],Two from state get ‘Nari Shakti’ award from Prez,"Patna: Bina Devi, who is popularly known as ‘Mushroom Mahila’ in Bihar, and Darbhanga-born Indian Air Force’s fighter pilot Bhawana Kanth received ‘Nari Shakti Puraskar 2019’ from President Ram Nath Kovind on International Women’s Day in Delhi on Sunday.

The two were among the 15 women who received this prestigious award for their extraordinary achievements. Bhawana was among the first three Indian Air Force’s women fighter pilots. She had conducted a solo flight in MIG-21 in 2018.

The 41-year-old Bina, who hails from Kilkari village in Tetia Bamber block of Munger district, popularized mushroom cultivation across the state. She trained farmers in mushroom (oyster and button) farming, organic farming, vermicompost production and organic insecticide preparation at home. She has generated self-employment for rural women in 220 households of her village and engaged many of them in dairy and goat farming.

Bina told this newspaper that the award motivated her to work harder in her endeavour. “I’m honoured that the state government selected my name for this honour. It was one of the best moments of my life. The appreciation always uplifts my willpower. Now, I’ll work harder to engage more women in farming,” she said.

Bina and her husband Krishna Kant have been engaged in mushroom farming for the last one decade after she joined Krishi Vigyan Kendra. She is now the master trainer at the centre.

“In one go, we cultivate around 200 bags of mushroom which we export across the state as well as to Kolkata. Usually, I grow oyster mushroom in summer and monsoon. Monsoon is the best time to grow oyster mushroom because of high humidity. It improves the quality. In winter time, we cultivate button mushroom,” Bina said.

She added: “Because of my work, I’m able to provide education to my kids. My elder son Himanshu is studying MCA in Delhi while Animesh is preparing for competitive exams after graduation. Pritam and Bhagyashre appeared for Intermediate exams this year.”

Bina has popularized mushroom production in 5 blocks and 105 neighbouring villages in Munger district, imparting training to 1,500 women in mushroom farming.

She had earlier received ‘Abhinav Kisan Puraskar’ in 2014 at Bihar Agriculture University, Sabour, by the then chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi. She was also awarded ‘Best Farmer Award’ at Kisan Mela organized by the state government in 2019.

AURANGABAD: The city police have arrested a 40-year-old trader for allegedly spreading communal hatred on a social media platform.

This is the second such arrest by the police in a week’s time after the man’s communally-charged comment went viral, which forced the cops to take action.

The trader has been identified as Shivnarayn Motilal Totla, who has a wholesale grocery business in the Old Mondha area of the city.

Authorities said the latest action by the City Chowk police station is on the lines of the standing orders issued by commissioner of police Chiranjeev Prasad. The commissioner had instructed the city police to deal with individuals posing threat to communal harmony and overall law and order situation.

Deputy commissioner of police (zone-I) Nikesh Khatmode Patil said, “Soon after registering an offence, we arrested the accused on Saturday night from his house. His statement has been recorded and the mobile phone has been seized and sent for forensic analysis.”

Police said that the accused claimed that he had received the objectionable photograph of a religious structure on a WhatsApp group ‘Vande Matram’ and he forwarded the same to another group ‘TGKMA’ — traders from the Old Mondha area are part of this group.

Detection branch’s police sub-inspector Pravin Kathkar said after the accused posted the alleged content in a group, the screenshots of the same went viral.

These were received by one of the citizens, who got a printout of the same and reached out to the City Chowk police station with a complaint.

Police said an offence under section 295 (for making destruction, damage, or defilement of a place of worship or an object held sacred, with intent to insult the religion of a class of persons) of the Indian Penal Code was registered on the accused.

He was sent to judicial custody by the court, following which, he applied for bail, which was granted.

Sensing trouble, the suspect deleted the post from the said group, before handing over the phone to the police, said a policeman privy to the probe.

PRAYAGRAJ: As the sale of substandard and artificial colours continues in the city, dermatologists have asked revelers to use natural colours to enjoy safe Holi .

Health department officials launched an awareness campaign in the city on Sunday and appealed people to avoid use of chemical-based colours.

Dr Shakti Basu , a dermatologist at Colvin Hospital, said: “Substandard colours may harm skin and eyes. Some colours are sold in the form of paste mixed with toxic compounds and substandard oil. Such colours may cause skin allergy and temporary blindness.”

District administration has failed to put effective curbs on the sale of artificial colours which are being sold in makeshift shops in Chowk, Rajapur, Sulemsarai, Bahadurganj, Johnstonganj , Leader road and Kothaparcha.

Last year, 110 patients were brought to different hospitals who complained of rashes, itching and skin problems due to Holi colours.

“If one is planning to play Holi with wet colours, one may apply body lotion or coconut oil all over the body, especially face, before going out,” he said.

According to eye specialists, arbitrary use of adulterated and synthetic colours can increase chances of injuries to eyes. Even ‘gulal’ and ‘abeer’ are known to have traces of asbestos which may cause corneal ulcer.

Additional chief medical officer Dr Anil Kumar said natural colours should be promoted and people should avoid unsafe colours.

Most of the colours sold at makeshift shops are oxidized metals or industrial dyes mixed with substandard oil.

Lead oxide (black), copper sulphate (green), aluminium bromide (silver) and mercury sulphite (red) are mostly used in colours which may cause allergy, temporary blindness, renal failure, skin cancer and paralysis.

“We are carrying out surprise raids in markets to tighten the noose around vendors selling substandard or artificial colours,” a senior district official said.

Shriniwas said that in the league matches, India performed extremely well, however, it was just one off day on the field.

“There’s a different kind of pressure playing in front of 80,000 spectators at Melbourne Cricket Ground and the players gave their best,” he said.

Talking about Smriti’s fondness of cricket, Shriniwas said that she used to follow her brother to his cricket practice sessions and got hooked on to it. She never enjoyed studying as much as cricket.

The Australian side defeated India by 85 runs for an unprecedented fifth T20 World Cup triumph on Sunday. Australia recorded 184 for four in 20 overs, while India crumbled to 99 all out.

The iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground saw a turnout of 86,174 people, which is a record in women’s cricket history.

NEW DELHI: Residents of Defence Colony decided to take matters into their own hands after struggling with the pathetic condition of main road facing JCO Club Defence Colony and few internal roads in A-block. On Sunday, several truckloads of malba (debris) were arranged to fill the potholes on these stretches, as commuting had become a nightmare on these roads.

Locals claimed that after they initiated the drive, Delhi Jal Board came forward to assist them to fill craters on roads. The potholes had developed after work for laying sewer lines was carried out four months ago.

“After the civic agency laid down the lines in December, the dug-up areas were filled temporarily with soil and no repairing or restoration was done by DJB. The work kept delaying for several reasons, including the assembly elections,” said a resident.

After the rain last week, the condition of these stretches worsened, forcing the residents to address the issue. “After the heavy rain on Thursday and Friday, these stretches further caved in at several spots. Vehicles were getting stuck in these potholes. So, we pooled in money and arranged for debris,” said a resident.

The resident added that DJB has also arranged for two trucks of debris to fix the potholes, but they want a concrete solution.

On being questioned, area MLA Madan Lal accepted that the main road has been in a shambles, but claimed that the civic agency had made the arrangements on Sunday, not the residents. “After Holi, the roads in A-block will be repaired properly. We are not responsible for the condition of other stretches in the area,” Lal said.

A resident of C-block said that the situation was the same in his locality too. “This is a B-category area while paying property taxes, but you’d not realise this while looking at the state of these roads,” he said.

Maj (retd) Ranjit Singh, president of Defence Colony RWA ,said that the elected representatives were ignoring the problems. “Not just the roads, even the sewage lines in the area are overflowing. The authorities need to address these as soon as possible,” Singh said.

KOLHAPUR: Civic chief Mallinath Kalshetti on Sunday suspended a Kolhapur Municipal Corporation ( KMC ) school acting-headmaster for going on leave without taking prior permission from the seniors.

During his surprise visit on Saturday morning to Barrister Balasaheb Khardekar Vidyamandir, Kalshetti found acting headmaster Namdev Wagh absent without informing the administrative officer of the school board. He also found two other teachers absent, who are identified as Subhash Marathe and Kiran Padalkar , against whom the show-cause notices have been issued.

An official of the primary education committee of KMC requesting anonymity said, “Three teachers of the school are already on leave. In such a case, the acting headmaster should have been in the school on a full-time basis. We found no permission was taken by him. The absence of the senior teachers in the school may lead to indiscipline and loss of academic work. Civic chief has also ordered an internal enquiry over the indiscipline of the teachers and other staff of the KMC schools.”

In recent weeks, Kalshetti is on spree to suspend the officers and other staff for arriving late to the office or failing to do their duty. He has demanded a reply from the two teachers, failing to provide a satisfactory response will result in their suspension. During the suspension, the civic body staff only get a fraction of their salary.

VADODARA: Four farm labourers from Mahisagar district were arrested on Sunday for killing a rat snake and then making a TikTok video of their act.

Forest department booked Jagdish Vaghela, Pravin Vaghela, Bharatsinh Vaghela and Vikram Vaghela under different sections of Wildlife Protection Act as the rat snake is a schedule II reptile specie.

According to forest department sources, the four labourers saw the snake escaping from a haystack in a farm where they were working on March 5 and ran behind it. They caught hold of it and then started playing with it. Soon, they started making a TikTok video with the reptile and in one of the videos they are seen hitting the snake with a wooden stick. “They hit the snake with a wooden stick and stones which ultimately killed the reptile,” said Balasinor range forest officer Daud Kokani.

The four made the videos even after killing the snake and then burnt the carcass. A day later, man from Rajkot saw the TikTok video and asked for their location. The accused told him that they are from Balasinor following which the man informed the forest department officials and also showed them the video. Kokani said that with the help of local informers, they could find all four farm labourers by Sunday.

“They were not aware that killing a snake is crime. They just wanted to have fun so they hit the snake for the videos,” Kokani said. On Sunday when they were asked why they had burnt the snake’s remains, they told foresters that they wanted to perform snake’s final rites. All four accused were sent to judicial custody on Sunday evening.

KOLHAPUR: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation ( KMC ) has removed over three dumpers of plastic waste from Jayanthi nullah on Sunday’s Mahaswachhta Abhiyan.

Over 150 sanitation workers were deployed along the stretch of the nullah which covered areas near Lakshmipuri, pumping station and Hutatma Garden. The civic body appealed to the people to join the cause and accordingly, some of the locals and people connected to various organisations, college students attended the drive.

From the past few weeks, the KMC reported dumping of a large amount of plastic waste into the nullah. Subsequently, 30 people were fined on Saturday for dumping the waste.

R K Patil, deputy hydraulic engineer of KMC said, “Currently, we are organising the drive to confiscate the plastic carry bags from the traders and fine them as part of the implementation of the plastic ban. Those restoring to throw plastic in open are also fined. We have found a large number of plastic waste in the Jayanthi nullah which crosses the city’s important localities. We found the plastic waste floating and deployed the staff at those places. We collected over three dumpers of plastic which will be disposed of properly.”

The KMC is going to identify the manufacturers of the plastic carry bags found in large quantities in the nullah. The officials claimed that most of the plastic waste was used for making small milk pouches. The KMC is going to visit the milk suppliers from the localities and ask them to strictly buy-back the milk pouches. The officials maintained that the locals use plastic pouches to collect the regular household waste which is then together dumped in the nullah.

“We are going to address the concerns of the locals about an inadequate number of garbage containers and no regular visits of the ghantagadis to collect the waste from door to doors,” added Patil.

117,['9/03/2020'],Former intel chief AB Venkateswara Rao contends charges in letter to MHA,"VIJAYAWADA: Former intelligence chief AB Venkateswara Rao has contended that the conformation of his suspension by the ministry of home affairs ( MHA ) was without considering his explanation.

In his explanation to MHA, Rao had said the allegations against him stemmed from due to his perceived closeness with the TDP government.

Rao said the inquiry by a DSP-rank official from CID was over two days after a memo was given by DGP on February 2, 2020 and the contents of the report are more or less same as in the memo with little extrapolations.

Rao said procurement of UAV and Aerostat was started in 2017 by the DGP’s office. A purchase order was issued by State Trading Corporation of India Limited (STCIL) with DGP’s approval but cancelled by DGP in December 2018.

He said while the intelligence department was the user agency for the equipment, the DGP’s office was the procuring agency. He was not a member of purchase committee or technical committee. The DGP’s office is answerable for any irregularity, and not ADG intelligence.

In his report to MHA, Rao said the memo by DGP on February 2 did not give any cause of action and reference to the source of suspicion.

He said in-house experts were involved in technology survey, product identification, demonstration, field visit, technical evaluation and licensing procedures. Rao said RFP and EOI were are not mandatory for every tender.

Rao said fixing technical evaluation criteria was not the job of the purchase committee and technical committee.

Rao said the purchase committee led by ADG C Dwaraka Tirumala Rao cut down the cost from Rs 44 crore to Rs 20 crore by scaling down five-year warranty and five-year annual maintenance to one year.

Rao said his son’s company did not give any demonstration on behalf of RT Inflatables. He said the chief secretary’s letter said the ‘demonstration of equipment is mandatory but not done’.

Rao said he was transferred on the very day the new government took charge. He was without a posting for more than eight months and an inquiry was initiated after his request for posting and salary.

The inquiry was over in two days and the government suspended a day after the report and it showed the malice in law, said Rao to MHA.

They have time till March 12 to upload as many as 34 documents to prove that their PhDs are not fake.

“I received my PhD from Sri Venkateswara University in 2014. I have the admission letter, pre-PhD course work, final thesis submission report, and the original degree with me. But where would I get the admission letter or name of the then Board of Studies (BoS) chairman along with proof, or a copy of the no objection certificate issued by the employer to pursue PhD while working?” asked M Vara Prasad Rao , a lecturer with 17 years of experience.

“I have submitted my certificates at least five times and appeared for physical verification more than 10 times. Except for collecting details, JNTU doesn’t analyse the data or release the results. We don’t know what their target is and why they are repeating this process every year,” Rao said.

President of Technical Institutions Employees Association V Balakrishna Reddy said, “Every year they have this verification drive in November or December, but never release the results. This is nothing but harassment.”

The professors said that the varsity can collect other details such as PhD registration number, name of the candidate, date of admission and date of degree awarded as well as the final thesis report and send these details to the respective universities for verification.

Meanwhile, varsity officials said that some of the documents have been made optional. “We asked for these documents as a few could not even give us their guide’s name. However, after the professors raised concerns, we made several of these documents optional,” said Ramamohan Reddy K, director (in-charge), Academic Audit Cell, JNTU-H.

Accused persons cannot be convicted on the basis of evidence collected during such faulty investigation.”The 1985 serial blasts, often dubbed as Delhi’s bloodiest brush with terror, were carried out with transistor-like contraptions with an explosive mixture of picric acid and ammonium nitrate, in addition to dry batteries. Bombs fitted in these transistors went off in Delhi and adjoining areas of UP and Haryana and unexploded bombs were recovered from various parts of Delhi.The accused were chargesheeted for offences of waging war against India, murder, attempt to murder, criminal conspiracy and various other charges of IPC and Explosives Substances Act. Of the 59 total chargesheeted people, 12 were declared proclaimed offenders and 12 people died whereas five were discharged in the case. A total of 1,399 witnesses were mentioned in the chargesheets and the prosecution examined 354 witnesses to prove the charges against the accused.It was observed that, unfortunately, the original chargesheet filed by Delhi Police was misplaced and a “reconstructed” one was filed. “Therefore, prosecution cannot establish the existence of original documents on the basis of list of documents mentioned in the chargesheet.The court also observed that a departmental inquiry was initiated against the then court officials responsible for misplacing the court documents. The order pointed towards some of the contradictions in the chargesheet in terms of circumstances that showed complicity of the accused.One such instance was about a bus having one of the accused with a transistor bomb. The court noted that, in an earlier part of the chargesheet, it was mentioned that the bus was going towards Ashram Chowk, but, subsequently, it stated it was onwards Kalyanpuri. “This contradiction in the chargesheet itself has not been explained by the prosecution,” the court said.The chargesheet also stated that on finding the bus crowded, the same accused got off and boarded a bus — on which he placed the bomb — going towards Maharani Bagh. “No details/particulars of the bus, including its number, etc., were collected by the investigating officer. No evidence was collected to clarify as to whether the bomb placed in the bus exploded or remained unexploded and, if the bomb remained unexploded, whether the same was defused or not.“In fact, nobody has come before the court to depose that he defused the bomb,” the court pointed out.While additional public prosecutor L D Singh submitted that it was a case of “heinous nature”, defence counsels R M Tiwari, Seema Gulati, Rakesh Mahajan and Nitin Rai Sharma had argued that their clients had been false implicated in these cases.The court noted that it was the prosecution’s case that accused people had hatched a conspiracy to create disharmony among various communities to take revenge of the Blue Star Operation and riots that happened in November 1984. It, however, observed that the prosecution had “miserably failed” to prove that any relatives, friends, near and dears of the accused died in the 1984 riots or in Blue Star Operation. It said, “It is amply clear from the evidence adduced on record that during investigation of the present case, police officials had picked up various people and made them approvers after pressuring and torturing them.”Holding that vital links were missing in the chain of circumstances, the court added that it could not be proved conclusively that the crime was committed by the accused and none else.The court also highlighted in its order that the accused were warned that if they did not depose as per demands of police, then they would be made an accused in the present case and their family members were “pressured” and “tortured” by police. “A number of witnesses have deposed about the manner in which police pressured people to depose on the dotted lines to create a false edifice of the alleged conspiracy,” it said.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74544771,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110797,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/35-years-on-30-acquitted-in-transistor-blasts-case/articleshow/74542718.cms

AURANGABAD: Justice Sanjay Gangapurwala of the Bombay high court on Sunday said several oppressed, suppressed and depressed classes from the society were unaware of the legal aid and necessary legal remedies available.

Speaking at the inauguration of the legal aid clinic at the National Law University (NLU) here, he appealed to all law students to reach out to such underprivileged people. “The legal aid clinic should create awareness among people. The facility must also make people aware of the different welfare schemes of the state,” he said.

“Through the legal aid clinic, students must go to villages and guide the rural population on their legal rights. Many people still do not know about the different welfare programmes and schemes. The clinic can spread awareness,” he said.

Set up at on the Kanchanwadi campus of the NLU, the legal aid clinic is expected to provide free legal advice and counselling for people from various sections of society, as well as facilitating mediation from time to time. The facility will have a pro-bono panel of resource persons who will volunteer and handle different cases that come to the clinic.

Gangapurwala said an alternative dispute resolution system was necessary. “There is a dire need of making pre-litigation mediation mandatory,” he added.

K V S Sarma, the vice-chancellor of NLU, Aurangabad, said, “The clinic will give much-needed exposure to law students about mainstream and alternative dispute resolution systems.”

122,['9/03/2020'],Valiyakesavan: Ban to be lifted today,"Thrissur: The forest department finally lifted the ban on Guruvayur tusker Valiyakesavan from Monday onwards.

The decision was based on the expert committee report, said Thrissur assistant conservator of forests (ACF) P M Prabhu. As per the direction from chief wildlife warden the forest department expert team led by Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University head of the department Dr Syam K Venugopal, and Dr David Abraham AFVO, Thrissur inspected the tusker Valiyakesavan, on Saturday and submitted a report to Thrissur ACF.

“While considering the report we will lift the ban on Valiyakesvan from Monday onwards for the next one month on a trial basis. The tusker can be used for the parades of Guruvayur Temple and for the parades of nearby temples. After one month we will again inspect the tusker and fully release the tusker,” said Prabhu.

“It was found that the tusker was cured of the fibroid cyst,” said the official.

Guruvayur Devaswom deputy administrator S Sasidharan said, “When the forest department lifts the ban on Monday we will use Valiyakesavan for Guruvayur Temple festival parade from Tuesday onwards. In addition, we will use Valiyakesavan for Pallivetta (Royal hunt) and Arattu (Holy bath) rituals on March 14 and 15.”

“Normally Padmanabhan and Valiyakesavan led the rituals of the Guruvayur Temple festival. Due to the demise of Padmanabhan the temple committee wishes Valiyakesavan to lead the rituals,” said Sasidharan.

The forest department had imposed restrictions on Guruvayur tuskers Padmanabhan and Valiyakesavan on December 7 against parading, due to age and health-related issues .

Later, the forest department formed an expert committee to inspect the health condition of the tuskers. Based on the expert committee report, the forest department lifted the ban on Padmanabhan on February 3. But later, the condition of Padmanabhan worsened and he died on February 26. TNN

123,['9/03/2020'],Coronavirus scare fails to tamp down Holi spirit in Prayagraj markets,"Residents out to shop and the congested lane of a market in Prayagraj on Sunday

PRAYAGRAJ: As the threat posed by novel coronavirus (Covid-19) looms large, concern over a potential outbreak failed to deter Prayagraj residents from thronging markets on Sunday for some last-minute shopping for Holi.

Popular markets like Chowk, Civil Lines, Katra, Bahadurganj, Mutthiganj and Sulemsarai wore a crowded look on Sunday as shoppers came out in large numbers.

Be it sweet shops selling ghujiyas or those offering gulal and herbal colours, there was hardly a shop without a crowd of customers .

Most shoppers said they were not bothered by the advisories issued by the government urging residents to avoid public gatherings due to the spread of novel coronavirus. The footfall in these markets only swelled by afternoon.

“My family and friends have decided to play Holi using natural colours as there is no threat of coronavirous in the city. Reports from other parts of the world might have dimmed the excitement, but there is nothing stopping us from playing Holi,” said a shopper in Civil Lines Vinayak Mehrotra.

Dhoomanganj resident Alok Srivastava said “People are not avoiding buying Holi supplies and colours that are for sale. I would be celebrating Holi with my friends and neighbours as well.”

Garima, who came to Civil Lines for shopping, said, “Why shouldn’t we celebrate Holi? The festival is celebrated is just once a year. If we take precautions, no harm will be done.”

Meanwhile, health department officials on Sunday claimed that no coronavirus cases have been reported in the city till now and they are trying to make more and more people aware about precautionary measures.

124,['9/03/2020'],"Flouting norms, two-wheelers being rented out to tourists in Mussoorie, allege residents","Mussoorie residents facing parking woes

MUSSOORIE: Taxi operators as well as residents have raised objections over the trend of two-wheelers being given out on rent to tourists in Mussoorie. It has been alleged that various norms were violated by two-wheeler rental operators while at the same time, vehicles are being arbitrarily parked across the town and are also creating traffic congestion and chaos.

SS Panwar , secretary of Mussoorie Taxi Association , said that operators need to have sufficient parking spaces for vehicles, a proper office space and also amenities such as toilets to obtain licence. He added, “Most of the two-wheeler rental operators do not have any parking, nor any office space or other facilities. They are violating all norms of the transport department.”

He also claimed that a large number of rented vehicles ply with private numbers while many operators run more number of vehicles than the sanctioned number.

Taxi operators added that two-wheeler rentals are taking away their business and jeopardising their livelihoods. “Last year, our revenues dipped 50% due to a spurt in two-wheeler rentals. We have to pay installments for our vehicles, meet maintenance costs and also take care of our families. How are we supposed to do that?” asked Mukesh Kharola , a taxi operator.

A few residents added that two-wheelers are eating up into the limited parking space that the hill town has. “They are parked everywhere across the town, creating a nuisance. They also cause a lot of traffic congestion,” said a Gandhi Chowk resident.

However, two-wheeler rental operators refuted the charges of violation of norms and any other malpractices.

“We have obtained due permission from the transport department and are functioning as per norms,” a two-wheeler rental operator who did not wish to be named, told TOI.

Mussoorie has around 800 to 1,000 two-wheelers, including commercial and private, that are operated on a rental basis. One can hire a scooty or a bike for a day for Rs 800 and Rs 1,500 respectively. For the same period, a Harley Davidson will cost around Rs 5,000.

Mussoorie SHO Vidhya Bhushan Negi , meanwhile, promised action against those flouting the rules. He said, “We will ensure that roadside parking of two-wheelers with commercial numbers is stopped. We will also initiate inquiry into the allegations of renting of private vehicles.”

125,['9/03/2020'],Counting error by returning officer leads to Serula re-poll,"Panaji:A year after the controversial results of the elections to the managing committee of the Serula comunidade were declared, the high court has directed that the elections to the posts of attorney, substitute attorney, treasurer and substitute treasurer be reheld - this time via open ballot.

During the elections that were held in March 2019, there was arithmetic incongruity on the part of the mamlatdar who was the election officer presiding over the elections—despite the process being videotaped.

More raised hands were counted than the voters actually present, the court found. The court observed that although there were only 375 voters, the show of hands counted were 378 votes for the post of substitute treasurer, 385 votes for the post of attorney and 379 votes for the post of substitute attorney.

“What troubles this court’s judicial conscience is the election officer’s indifferent attitude. In the first round, the disgruntled panel of candidates did their best to stymie the election process. The election officer and the police were mere spectators,” said the high court in its December order. “ In the second round, the panels do not seem to have played any disruptive role. Instead, the election officer played spoilsport. The candidates plead they have no clue how the excess votes were accounted for,” the order said.

“So the election officer alone could have explained how it had happened—how more hands were raised, than there actually were,” the court noted adding that the mamlatdar has allowed the rival candidates to slug it out and settle the matter for themselves.

“As a public servant, the mamlatdar is expected to be more responsible and responsive. He could have cleared the air and assisted the court; rather, he is bound to do so. As a result, his attitude has led to further delay and expenditure, which otherwise could have been avoided,” the court held.

Nagpur: Different nuances of various ragas were captured effectively by classical vocal singer Mandar Gadgil from Pune at a programme titled ‘Brahmanaad’, organized by South Central Zone Cultural Centre (SCZCC), on Sunday.

As morning chill in the air has subsided, a good number of connoisseurs of music soaked in the warmth of class that was evident in the gayaki of Mandar who triggered emotions by selecting the ragas suitable to the event and performing them with aplomb.

Mandar chose ‘Lalat’, which is essentially sung at dawn, to begin his performance and presented a bandish ‘Ghatan lagi rain’ in vilambit Ek Taal. He caught on to the pulse of the audience with his melodious voice as he sang in madhyalaya, transforming the mood of the performance.

His presentation of ‘Ja ja re ja balamwa’, wooing the one close to heart, was immediately lapped up by the audience. A rather soft rendition, his mellifluous voice matched the sentiments that a yearning person has.

Recitation of raag Bhatiyar was lilting as Mandar made full use of his vocals, presenting taans and aalaps, with ease.

He splashed colours of singing that he has in his armoury when he sang a hori in raag Bhairavi. Music lovers related to the raga as the festival of Holi is round the corner.

The jugalbandi of high-pitched vocals and instrumental music made the performance top notch.

The thumping beats of tabla, coupled with soft instrumental sound of harmonium, went along perfectly with the vocals of Mandar. He made his presentations sound pleasant.

Mandar was accompanied by Ram Khadse on tabla and Narendra Kadwe on harmonium.

In between, Mandar engaged with jugalbandi between his rendition, tabla and harmonium.

As Sunday was celebrated as International Women’s Day, SCZCC director took the opportunity to felicitate women employees of the centre who work tirelessly to make cultural programmes organized by SCZCC successful.

Those who were honoured included Ujjwala Indurkar, Sabia Naz, Shital Sonpipare, Geeta Shanguwar, Nisha Pande, Shweta Tiwari, Chitra Manohare and Jyoti Gurve.

The programme was anchored by Shweta Shelgaonkar.

Earlier, the programme was inaugurated with the lighting a traditional lamp by SCZCC director Deepak Khirwadkar, deputy director Mohan Parkhi, social worker Abhay Gokhale, Deepali Khirwadkar and Swarupa Dande.

Programme officer Shashank Dande, Shrikant Desai and Deepak Patil were present.

129,['9/03/2020'],Gadchiroli women cops undergo C-60 commando training,"Representational pic

Nagpur: A group of women cops from Gadchiroli, responding to a call by SP Shailesh Balkawade, have undergone the ‘jungle warfare and guerrilla tactics’ of the district polices’ elite force ‘C-60 commandos’.

The unit of the women cops, groomed on the lines of C-60 commandos, are learnt to be kept reserved for a ‘specific purpose’.

The training and accomplishments of the C-60 commandos in dealing with Maoists violence had catapulted to a nationwide fame after the April 2018 encounters when they had set a benchmark by eliminating 40 cadres of the reds at Kasnasur-Boriya encounters.

Around a month ago, Balkawade had sent a wireless message to all the posts asking for women cops from the district who are keen to undergo ‘one-month training’ at the Gadchiroli polices’ own jungle warfare and guerrilla tactics academy in the district which trained the C-60 commandos. The SP had a handful of interested cops coming forward to join the training from different parts of the district.

Balkawade said the cops were hand-picked from the interested lot on the basis of their physical abilities and other parameters. “There was a specific reason for creating a group of women commandos but it cannot be discussed. We have just kept them ready and fit to serve the secret mission when required,” he said. “It’s a fact that Maoists have almost 50% of their dalam strength in women but our creating the specially trained group was not in respond to such a situation,” said the SP.

Balkawade also stated that women cops for the first time have been introduced in the ‘Long range patrolling’ (LRP) in which they are required to remain, operate and move in the forest in anti-Maoist missions for couple of days at a stretch. “We had already introduced women in the Short range patrolling (SRP) in the past but just now have started sending them on few LRPs too based on the situation but as a part of a team and not as an independent contingent,” he said.

Balkawade also extolled the contribution of the women in the ‘grambhets’ or village visits in collecting intelligence by meeting with the housewives who would not otherwise open up with men cops. “There are certain issues which women would not be able to discuss with men. In such a situation, women cops can more easily cater to such a need,” he said.

Balkawade also said women cops are now being more increasingly used in the outreach programs like ‘Jan jaagaran melawas’ or different camps in the interiors.

“The government will sell non-performing assets and land available with Deccan Infrastructure and Land Holdings Limited , Telangana Housing Board and Rajiv Swagruha to raise money. The United AP government had established them when real estate sector was in a slump. Now, real estate is in a boom phase again. We will exploit land banks and use the money to implement various schemes,” finance minister T Harish Rao said in his budget speech on Sunday.

Official sources said Housing Board and DIHL possess about 4,000 acres land bank, while TSIIC, Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) have about 2,000 acres land ready for auction. HMDA has already started developing a layout at Kokapet in an 650 acres. “Various government departments have identified land parcels which can be used for resource mobilisation. The government had planned resource mobilisation last year too, but could not go ahead due to series of elections,” a senior official of revenue department said.

Apart from land auction, the municipal administration department hopes to raise Rs 3,000 crore to Rs 4,000 crore by giving Hyderabad Outer Ring Road toll fee collection contract for longer period, between five and 10 years. Officials said National Highways Authority of India has already been doing this for the past few years.

Later, interacting with the media after the budget presentation, finance minister Harish Rao said apart from auctioning land, strategies were being worked out to improve revenues from sand and other minerals. “With increasing license fee by the excise department, the government has been getting Rs 300 crore additional revenue a month for the past three months. Going by this, excise department alone gets Rs 6,000 crore additional revenue for 12 months in the next financial year,” he said. The minister said the government was also considering giving one-time settlement for commercial establishments for clearing arrears.

The state government has already made its intentions clear to enhance government land value (market value) for registering properties and power tariff from April.

CHARMINAR: While textbooks teach students the importance of hygiene and health, this school in Old City is struggling to keep its surroundings clean, thanks to the mounds of uncleared garbage near its entrance. Apart from being an eyesore and causing a stench, the sight of animals feasting on the scattered garbage greets students of the school in Kabutar Khana , Hussaini Alam , regularly.

Local residents and officials of the school said that the garbage is posing serious health risks. They are worried that the locality will soon turn into a haven for mosquitoes.

School authorities said that repeated pleas to the civic authorities to clear the waste have fallen on deaf ears. “We have complained many times to the GHMC authorities, asking them to clear the garbage from outside the school building, but nothing has been done so far. Though the school is clean, as soon as the students step out, the sight of garbage strewn all over greets them,” said Monika Verma, administrator of Sri Maheshwari Vidyalaya , Kabutar Khana.

One of the students said that due to the unpleasant smell wafting from the garbage strewn all over, parents have become apprehensive of sending their wards to the school.

“We want the authorities to do something and clear the garbage. It’s a potential health hazard. Also, due to the stench, we can’t have our lunch properly,” said another student of the same school.

Apart from cleaning the garbage, residents have also requested the government and GHMC officials to ensure regular fogging in Old City areas to keep mosquitoes away.

AURANGABAD: Two teachers were terminated from service and a third could lose pension benefits after they were found to have played a role in a mass copying incident during the SSC examination last year.

The termination notices were issued by the Saraswati Bhuvan Education Society (SBES) here, which also recommended the withholding of pension of one retired teacher, Bapu Kothawade.

The mass copying incident took place on March 11, 2019, at a school run by the SBES in the Gondegaon village of Soygaon taluka , in Aurangabad district . The students were writing the mathematics paper.

The incident had sent shockwaves through the academic circles in the region. As many as 321 students were found guilty of malpractice by the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, which also barred them from appearing for three exams until March 2020.

Two teachers — Pradeep Mahalpure and Sandip Mahalpure — have been terminated from services, the SBES said in a press release. The Society has also written to the government recommending the withholding of Kothawade’s pension. An inquiry into the incident alleged that Kothawade, who was appointed as supervisor, had abetted the copying.

“The MSBSHSE and the education department had asked for stern action against the guilty teachers for their involvement in the mass copying incident, following which, an internal inquiry was conducted. The probe found the three teachers guilty and necessary action has been taken against them. The incident not only caused academic loss to students but also dented the reputation of the organisation,” the SBES said.

Besides the three teachers, all staffers of the Gondegaon school will not receive their annual increment.

The ban on the 321 students had sparked protests from a section of parents who claimed that varying scores in the mathematics paper I showed that mass copying hadn’t occurred.

All the students were summoned for a probe by the MSBSHSE in batches of 100 on June 14, 15 and 17 last year. During the inquiry, officials informed the students about their marks even as their SSC results were on hold.

A section of parents demanded photocopies of the mathematics answer sheet as proof to substantiate their claims of disparity in the marks secured by students. But the MSBSHE rejected the request.

The parents also did not carry out their threat of legal action against the MSBSHE. The SBES too refused to support those who denied the incident of mass copying.

138,['9/03/2020'],women celebrate women’s struggle,"Panaji: The issue of chairpersons not being appointed to the Goa state police complaints authority as well as the commission for women were raised during the celebration of ‘Citizens Rights are Women’s Rights’ on Sunday.

Highlighting the “struggle of women”, the women’s collective Bailancho Saad stated that these systems meant to help women have collapsed.

“Instead of addressing complaints women have had counter complaints filed against them. This has been the greatest challenge to women today,” Martins said.

A rape survivor narrated her struggle with a false case filed against her by police and the government’s denying her compensation under the victim compensation scheme for want of funds.

“I was not provided legal aid when I was arrested and I was kept in the lock up for four days due to which I lost my job. My medical records were hidden from me and were not produced in the chargesheet. I have also been told that there are no funds available for women under the women’s compensation scheme,” she said.

To ensure the safety of women, Martins highlighted the importance and necessity of electrification. “Kadamba bus stand, the GMC parking area are not electrified. Electrification is important,” she said.

The women’s collective also took a stand against CAA- NPR-NRC stating that women are already struggling with documentation. “Many women who apply for the senior citizens scheme don’t have birth certificates. When women are put out of the house and want to set up a home they don’t get a gas connection, they don’t have a ration cart, the electricity connection is not in her name. Although women in Goa have equal property rights, men are the administrators and women don’t get their share,” she said.

“There are several issues that have come in this struggle we are very apprehensive of this NPR and NRC which will come. Women now itself have problems with documents so you can imagine if this comes true, women will be further marginalised. There will be more human rights violations if there are detention centres so we demand that the CAA- NPR- NRC should not be implemented,” Martins said.

139,['9/03/2020'],"No commercial activities on school premises, rules HC","Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court has directed the district magistrates of all the districts in state to ensure that no commercial activities of any kind, like running coaching centres, shops or holding weddings, are organized on the property of recognized and government-aided schools.

Hearing a petition filed by one Deependra Vikram Singh of Jaunpur, Justice Ashok Kumar said, “No marriage function or commercial activities can be organized on the land and building of schools/colleges/institutions.”

While directing to list the petition on March 3, 2020, the court directed that a copy of this order be provided to Uttar Pradesh chief secretary and principal secretary (education) by the state counsel within three days for compliance and appropriate actions.

The court further directed the chief secretary and principal secretary (education) to issue appropriate orders within two weeks and ensure true compliance of the government order dated September 29, 2012, which prohibits any commercial activities on the land and building of recognized and government aided institutions.

In addition, the court also directed all DMs to call for the explanations from institutions and to direct them to furnish details as to how and when they permitted commercial activities in their institutions, particularly the use of playground, which is exclusively meant for the students of the institutions for sports activities.

The petitioner, a member of a society, which looks after the affairs of educational institutions alleged in the petition that the management of Tilakdhari Inter College and Tilakdhari Post Graduate Degree College of Jaunpur district is allowing non-educational activities, like permitting private persons to use the property of institutions to run shops, use the playground of institutions for purpose of marriage functions/ ceremonies and other commercial activities.

He said that since both institutions are government aided, therefore, in permitting other events than educational and sports activities, the management of the aforesaid institutions is not only collecting money but clearly disobeying the September 29, 2012 GO and also prohibiting the students of institutions to use the playground for playing/ sports activities.

140,['9/03/2020'],75-year-old killed in Patna over land dispute,"Picture for representational purpose only.

PATNA: Armed criminals shot dead a retired postal department employee near his residence on Veer Kunwar Singh Path in north S K Puri of Patna on Sunday morning.

The 75-year-old Sakaldeo Rai was about to enter his home after purchasing vegetables when two criminals on a white sports bike pumped three bullets into his chest around 10.40am and escaped through the narrow lane leading to Boring Road, an eyewitness said.

A dispute over 32 katthas of land at Chandmari village under Shahpur police station in western Patna is stated to be the reason behind the murder. “The person riding pillion tapped Rai’s left shoulder. When he turned towards them, he fired at Rai, who fell down. His elder son Manish was also standing in one corner of the house. He rushed towards Rai but he died on the spot,” the eyewitness said. He further said that the one driving the bike was wearing a helmet while the killer had not hidden his face.

Incharge City SP (central) D Amarkesh said Rai’s son Manish identified one of the accused from CCTV footage as Suraj, the son of Devendra. Manish runs a restaurant on the ground floor of the three-storey building owned by the deceased. Rai’s younger son Manoj is a software engineer and lives in New York.

When contacted, Shahpur police station SHO Dheeraj Kumar said a scuffle had taken place over land dispute between Devendra and one Mahendra Rai on January 3, 2018. “FIRs were lodged from both sides. Devendra and Mahendra’s son Rahul Rai had been sent to jail in that case,” he said, adding Mahendra was from Sakaldeo’s side.

“The land dispute between Sakaldeo and Devendra is very old, but no related case is lodged with the police. Several panchayat meetings had taken place on the issue,” he said.

A person close to Sakaldeo’s son told TOI that Manish had once gone to Beur jail to meet Rahul but incidentally Suraj was also there to meet his father. “Suraj had tried to thrash Manish by grabbing his collar,” he added.

Rai lived with his wife, son Manish and other family members in the three-storey building. Sakaldeo had retired as a section officer from GPO, Patna.

As the first step, the main tourist attraction in the district headquarters, Payyambalam Beach, would be declared plastic-free and the project would start from April 1.

The project is being launched with the support of the Suchitwa Mission, district administration and Kannur corporation would utilize the CSR fund of Rs 30 lakh.

Plastic carry bags, nonwoven carry bags, flex boards, plastic banners, plates, cups, spoons and other utensils made of plastic, as also thermocol would be banned, said DTPC secretary Jitheesh Jose.

“We decided to launch the project in Payyambalam on a pilot basis because this is the place where the most number of people visit, and if we are able to successfully implement it here, we would be able to introduce it in other places as well,” he said.

To begin with, the authorities would strengthen the surveillance and there is a proposal to install surveillance cameras to nab those who dump waste there and impose fine, he said.

Outsiders dumping waste in Payyambalam is a major issue. Those who bring plastic products will not be permitted to take it on to the beach, he said.

Green volunteers under Kudumbashree would also be deployed to manage it.Even the hawkers who sell eatables and other products have to make sure that they do not use any plastic products.

Even for ice cream, plastic containers would not be permitted, and the shopkeepers, hawkers and visitors should cooperate with the green mission, said the authorities.

“We are also planning to have facilities to provide alternative products for the visitors coming to Payyambalam so that we can strictly implement the campaign,” he said.

The aim of the DTPC is to make all the tourist destinations plastic-free in the next few months, he added.

NEW DELHI: After recording three straight days of ‘satisfactory’ air quality — Delhi’s cleanest air spell since September — the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) fell to the ‘moderate’ range on Sunday with a reading of 164 on CPCB’s daily bulletin. In comparison, the AQI was below 80 on Thursday, Friday and Saturday — falling to as low as 64 on Friday.

Track the pollution level in your city

While the capital was aided by a spell of incessant rain and strong winds, experts said its withdrawal and a drop in wind speed had led to a slight deterioration in air quality. The IMD has meanwhile forecast another spell of rain to hit Delhi on the night of March 10, as well as March 11 and 12.

System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) forecasts air quality to remain in the ‘moderate’ range in the next 48 hours before another spell of rain hits Delhi on March 11 and 12, which could once again lead to an improvement in air quality.

“AQI is likely to marginally improve and stay in the lower end of moderate category on March 10 and 11,” said SAFAR.

Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at India Meteorological Department (IMD), said a fresh western disturbance will influence parts of north Rajasthan, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh on March 10-11, bringing a spell of light rain on the night of Holi (March 10), as well as on March 11. A light drizzle could also be recorded in the morning on March 12. “The major impact of the western disturbance will be on March 11, with strong gusty winds of 35-40 km/hour also blowing. This will once again lead to an improvement in air quality and bring down the mercury,” said Srivastava.

Meanwhile, the maximum temperature on Sunday was recorded at 24.8 degrees Celsius — four notches below normal. The minimum temperature was also recorded three notches below the normal mark, at 11.1 degrees Celsius.

Met officials forecast a rise in mercury in the next 48 hours, with the maximum likely to touch 27 degrees Celsius by Monday and 28 degrees Celsius by Tuesday. “There will be a drop in the maximum temperature from Wednesday after rain. It will remain below the normal mark on Thursday too,” said a Met official.

HYDERABAD: Despite an overall economic slowdown in the country, the state government has prioritised welfare schemes and has even enhanced allocations towards such schemes, finance minister T Harish Rao said. “The government believes that the antidote to recession is to enhance people’s purchasing power and spending resources on capital expenditure,” he told media after budget presentation.

The minister said that the Kalyana Laxmi scheme is likely to see another 70,000 beneficiaries following the increase in allocation from Rs 1,540 crore to Rs 2,240 crore. The allocation for Asara pension scheme was also raised from Rs 9,402 crore to Rs 11,750 crore. Harish Rao state that a few innovative schemes were also proposed in the budget.

“Since Godavari is alive for about 150km throughout the year, it was decided to develop a tourism circuit under the Godavari Tourism Circuit Project by allocating Rs 300 crore.

To settle this, he said, another Rs 800 crore was allocated towards the scheme.

They try so much but can’t touch my inner mystery

-- Maya Angelou | American poet

Bengaluru: Last week, Kannada writer Vijaya, popularly known as Vijayamma, received the Central Sahitya Akademi Award for her autobiography ‘Kudi Esaru.’ The award for the 78-year-old writer - who also happens to be a journalist, an activist, an academician, a publisher and a film critic - is a long overdue salute to the never-say-die spirit of all those women who live inspiring lives, fighting adversity, challenging stereotypes, questioning gender bias and refusing to be bogged down by hegemonic masculinity that conspires to silence their voice at every step. The prestigious award is also a recognition for women’s autobiographical writing in Kannada, which has emerged as a powerful form of feminist literature in recent years.

“It is not easy to document memories. It is a painful process,” writes Vijaya in the opening pages of her autobiography. The intensity of her pain and suffering shakes readers to the core. Utter poverty in childhood, domestic violence, sexual torture at the hands of the man she was married to and a series of forced abortions leave such an unsettling feeling among readers that one would wonder how anyone could even survive after going through such a trauma. But Vijaya not just survives, she thrives. Through sheer grit and determination she rises like a phoenix from the ashes and soars high into the sky, turning her story of misery into one of success and glory.

Initially reluctant to pen her autobiography, Vijayamma says she finally yielded to plenty of persuasion by her sons, friends and relatives. And as she sat down to write, a plethora of questions pervaded her mind: “After all, why should I write? Whom would it benefit? Aren’t there other women who have bigger achievements to their credit than me and who have undergone worse sufferings? Or am I scared to put my private experiences in public domain? Scared of whom?”

Such questions have indeed been the historical reasons for the delay in the process of women’s autobiographical works taking shape as a full-fledged genre in world literature. Critics observe that even in the western world, while powerful men of the 18th century like Benjamin Franklin wrote their autobiographies glorifying themselves as role models, any significant attempts by women achievers to document their life began only in 1960s, albeit with hesitance, modesty and self- effacement.

In her critical essay published in the book ‘Iruvanthige’ (ed. Savitha Nagabhushan, Tarini Shubhadayini) Geeta Vasanth, assistant professor at Tumkur University, points out that Kannada literary world had to wait till late 1970s for women’s autobiographies to emerge. Initially their numbers were few and far as compared to Marathi but swelled significantly in the 21st century. Guru Dutt’s mother Vasanthi Padukone’s ‘Jeevana Horata,’ written in 1977, is probably the first ever autobiography by a woman in Kannada. Then came the autobiography of Parvatamma Mahalingashetti (daughter of former chief minister Nijalingappa), which made a commendable effort to record the domestic, social and economic condition of women in the 20th century.

In 2008, writer Vaidehi chronicled some memoirs of Saraswatibai Rajwade, a 20th century child actor and writer from Dakshina Kannada. A childhood spent in penury, Saraswati’s marriage at the age of 15 to the deputy collector of Thanjavur did bring her riches but confined her to home. Her insecure husband, a widower 37 years older than her, would lock her up while he left for work, hanging a ‘Not at Home’ board outside. When his suspicious nature crossed all limits of decency, a disgusted Saraswati yanked the mangalasutra from her neck and flung it on his face. In her pain and loneliness, she took to books and also began to write and became an accomplished writer under the pen name ‘Giribaale.’

Work-life balance

As women became more educated and started pursuing their chosen professions, striking a work-life balance threw new challenges. In her life story written in the format of a novel, Shashikala Vastrad exposes man’s fragile ego which gets bruised for the simple fact that his wife is working, talented and has an independent personality. His manhood finds its fulfilment in clipping her wings. And even when the spouse is understanding and supportive, woman finds it difficult to focus on her career because childcare and household chores are considered her ‘department,’ and claim most of her time. In fact, marriage itself is like a speed-breaker in a woman’s life. The joy of motherhood often comes at the cost of career. Missed opportunities remain a source of regret. The autobiographies of physician-writer Anupama Niranjan and theatre personality Bhargavi Narayan effectively bring these issues to fore.

When personal is political

“Behind every successful man there is a woman, and behind every successful woman there is a dissatisfied man,” so reads a line from a poem by Prathibha Nandakumar. With her daring and ultra-modern poems like ‘Naavu Hudigiyare Heege’(This Is How We Girls Are, 1977) Prathibha created a stir four decades ago and when she published her autobiography ‘Anudinada Antaragange’ in 2012 she gave a new twist and turn to women’s writing in Kannada. In what was a reminder of the response to Malayalam writer Kamala Das’s ‘My Story,’ Prathibha’s bold and riveting account evoked severe reactions of admiration and criticism as she upheld her personal self and candidly wrote about her sensuality, passions, trials of marriage, indulgent relationships, eternal search for love and self-awakening.

“In case of men, relationships outside marriage are looked at as an extension of their experience, whereas the same is considered a crime in case of women,” observes Geeta Vasanth. Taking on the patriarchal ideologies that tend to decide how a woman should walk, talk and live, theatre personality, actor and former minister Umashri, a born fighter, lets out her anguish in her memoirs ‘Benki-Bedagu’: “I damn this heartless society which is always on its toes to cast aspersions on a woman’s character instead of valuing her struggle and hard work.”

These empowering stories of women from different walks of life are also excellent social commentaries of their times, documenting a wide range of issues like poverty, women’s education, literary and cultural movements, theatre, cinema, healthcare, political ideologies, growth of media, trade unions, religious practices and traditions and so on. Fighting male dominance that ranges from passive aggressiveness to tyranny, these women of substance derive their strength from within and celebrate life, being a source of inspiration to many. Their stories do not remain their stories alone. The individual becomes collective and the personal becomes political. For instance, when theatre personality and former Rajya Sabha MP B Jayashri recalls in her autobiography the horror of her step-father attempting to sexually abuse her in her adolescent days, or when she regrets the fact that nobody in her family ever bothered to get her admitted to a formal school, she speaks not just about herself. Her powerful voice represents the plight of lakhs of voiceless girls in the country and calls for political attention and legal address.

And for those men who criticize that kitchen, children and household chores still occupy much space in women’s autobiographies, here’s a quote by Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg: “A truly equal world would be one where women ran half our countries and companies and men half our homes.” The campaign theme of International Women’s Day - 2020 is ‘Each for Equal.’ Collectively each one can help create a gender equal world. So, are we game?

EMPOWERING VOICES

Should I call my life’s journey ‘A saga of a deserted woman?’ No. I don’t like the words ‘deserted’ and ‘abandoned.’ I leave it to the readers to decide what it is – Vijaya

No doubt women are now economically independent and have achieved social standing. Yet, a conflict still goes on in their minds between ‘them and society’ – B Jayashri

If something is being denied to you simply because you are a woman, then it needs to be protested – Prathibha Nandakumar

AN INSPIRING JOURNEY

Born in 1942, Vijaya lost her mother early in life and grew up amidst pangs of poverty. She got married at a young age while pursuing her matriculation. Sexual, emotional and physical abuse turned her married life into hell. But she did not succumb. She rose from the mire, took life head on, raised her two sons as a single parent, continued her college education after divorce, completed her postgraduation and PhD in Kannada literature, and rose to fame as a fiction and non-fiction writer and film critic. She set up her own printing press and encouraged budding writers. She introduced several talents to Kannada film industry. As an activist she brought hopes in the lives of women garment workers and pourakarmikas. Many accolades came her way including the State and Central Sahitya Akademi Awards and the Rajyotsava Award. ‘Kudi Esaru,’ (Boiling Curry) is an objective account of her story as a fighter, survivor and achiever.

150,['9/03/2020'],"In 10 yrs, Lamakaan turns into creative hub of Hyd","Hyderabad: Of all the hurdles that Lamakaan , a first-of-its-kind cultural hub in the city, has overcome in its 10 years of existence, few were as hard as working around the steep rise in onion prices last year.

“Surprised? That’s because Lamakaan runs almost entirely on the back of its kitchen,” says Anant Maringanti, among the 14 curators of the cultural centre on Road No. 1 Banjara Hills which is all set to celebrate its 10th anniversary. It’s a business model anyone who wishes to start such a space can emulate, he suggests.

At the centre’s tiny open kitchen that feeds hundreds a day, the pace is brisk and there’s little time for chit chat. The head chef recalls that in the initial days after the centre opened a decade ago, only a few came to watch the sparse shows and not more than a bowl of samosas was sold. But it wasn’t long before word of the quality of Lamakaan’s shows including dance programmes, music events, debates and talks as also its piping hot chai spread and the centre turned into a bustling creative space.

Over the years, Lamakaan, which in Arabic means a house without boundaries, has hosted 852 plays, 317 art shows, 812 workshops, 507 art performances, 1,050 talks, 30 night school events and 466 movie screenings, most of which were free.

The property originally belonged to M Hassan, a founder-member of the Society to Save Rocks, after whose death his nephew Ashhar Farhan assumed the reins of the space and turned it into a liberal hub for progressive cultural practices along with other co-founders in honour of his uncle. “Lamakaan has, so far, been driven by the people,” Farhan explains, adding that his team is exploring ways to improve it further. With many similar spaces mushrooming across the city, Lamakaan must reinvent itself.

“The change too will be driven by the people,” says Farhan.

151,['9/03/2020'],Transistor bomb blasts case in Delhi: ‘Our lives are over... can’t make up for years lost’,"A Delhi court has acquitted 30 people in the 1985 transistor bomb blasts, which left 49 people dead and 127 in... Read More

NEW DELHI: After one of the longest trials in the capital’s history ended with the acquittal of 30 of the 59 accused in the 1985 transistor bomb blasts case, three of the freed men said on Sunday that the acquittal could not make up for the years they had lost.

Daljit Singh, now 58, is unable to reconcile to the damage caused to him and his family. It was in May 1985 that he had last felt a free man: it was after he had written his BA final exams in Delhi. “I went to my hometown Chandigarh... I later learnt the police had raided my house in Delhi,” he said.

Daljit said police were under pressure to solve the case. The investigation, he said, was “selective” in leaving out the real culprits. The six months that he was in jail in Delhi and UP would set a long, arduous legal battle in motion. “Neighbours turned hostile...The family sold off the house for pittance to fight my case,” he said.

His parents died in the hope they would see their son being cleared. His relatives boycotted him. Bail came six months after spending jail time. The reprieve gave way to fresh challenges. “During festivals such as Dussehra, my family and I would venture out separately to watch the celebrations,” said Daljit.

After app-based cab aggregators entered the scene, Daljit lost out on his only skill of driving taxi. “As I couldn’t earn, I couldn’t educate my children. Now, I am struggling to marry off my son,” he says.

Gurmeet Singh was 18 years and four days old on the day of his arrest. Now 52, he recalls how his family faced harassment on a regular basis. “Nobody from my family got a passport. It would be either me or my family who would get called at the police station whenever a blast or any similar incident occurred,” he said.

While out on bail in the 90s, Daljit was with his brother on a bike in R K Puram when he was apprehended by police and let off only four days later. “The three decades are nothing short of a nightmare. They called it transistor bomb blasts. It was only 21 years after the incident that the hearing gained some speed. It saw several judges. Although there were 1,100 witnesses, there was not a single eyewitness,” he argues.

Jaspal Singh, now 54, lost out on what he calls the “prime years”. He said: “A lot was lost in the passing years. I lost my job. And when I walked out on bail, there was a serious resentment in my social circle towards me.”

Desperate for help, his family knocked on the doors of some of the privileged. “But they also shut their doors. Life is over despite my acquittal. My parents lost theirs hoping to see their son walk free,” says Jaspal.

Advocate Nitin Rai Sharma, who defended some of the accused, including the main accused Kartar Singh who died during the case’s pendency, and his wife Surjit Kaur, feels justice was delayed and denied to the accused and the society at large. He points out that it was a “shoddy investigation” under a “political witch hunt” for one section. “Many accused were teenagers at the time of their arrests. That Kaur faced trial for 35 years and lost two of her sons and husband speaks volumes of the state’s apathy,” he says.

KANPUR: A 24-year-old girl immolated herself on late Saturday night after she was allegedly scolded by her father over her habit of consuming ‘gutkha’.

The incident took place around 10 pm at a house in Shastri Nagar in Kakadeo police station area.

According to police, Arvind, cousin of deceased Manisha , said that his uncle had scolded her for eating ‘gutkha’ while she was preparing food on Saturday night.

According to him, earlier also on several occasions, Manisha’s father had reprimanded her for her excessive gutkha’ consumption habit, the police said.

“On late Saturday night too, her father rebuked her when he caught her red-handed chewing ‘gutkha’ while she was cooking food in the kitchen. Manisha, who was extremely upset, went inside her room with a container of kerosene and after bolting herself set herself on fire,” the police added.

Minutes later, Manisha rushed out engulfed in flames.

“On seeing her aflame, her kin tried to save her and admitted her to the burn unit of Lala Lajpat Rai hospital in a critical condition where she succumbed on Saturday,” said police officials.

Kakadeo police station in-charge, Kaushal Kishore Dikshit , said, “Manisha’s death was a clear case of suicide. Her body has been sent to the mortuary for the post-mortem examination. As per the family members, she took the drastic step on being scolded by her father over her excessive gutkha consumption habit.”

156,['9/03/2020'],NMC declares all 22 rooftop restaurants fire-unsafe,"Nagpur: Over 26 months after the infamous Kamala Mills fire incident which claimed 14 lives and injured several in Mumbai on December 29, 2017, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) fire and emergency services department has declared 22 rooftop restaurants in the city as fire-unsafe.

It is for the first time in the civic body’s history that rooftop restaurants have been declared unsafe.

Following action from fire department under Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act, 2006, the state’s urban development department (UDD) has stressed the need for the NMC to also inspect these rooftop restaurants for violation of building bylaws under Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act and submit report.

Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe, on March 6, reportedly directed officials of town planning, enforcement departments and zone offices to conduct inspection and initiate action under MRTP Act immediately. Mundhe also slammed officials of these departments for neglecting action for so long.

The fire department has also written a letter to town planning department suggesting action under MRTP Act.

During the ongoing budget session, MLC Jogendra Kawade has submitted a starred question following which the UDD sought information from the NMC. After getting the civic body’s reply that fire department has taken action against 22 rooftop restaurants in the city, the UDD has on March 6 questioned the NMC’s inaction and directed it to submit action taken report for building bylaws violations.

NMC’s fire department officials told TOI that rooftop restaurants were declared unsafe in a phased manner in the last one month. “We have not declared entire buildings unsafe, except rooftop restaurants. Action on remaining part of the buildings will be decided after inspection to assess whether building bylaws have been flouted. We will ask for disconnection of power and water supply if these rooftop restaurants continue to operate. We will send the cases to police department for registering an offence and may also seal the establishments later,” said the officials.

Unofficial sources put the number of unauthorized restaurants on terrace of commercial buildings at around 50, but as per fire department there are only 22 restaurants and action has been initiated against all of them.

Following ongoing PIL in the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court, the fire department is completing all formalities of action.

The officials said, “We have demolished structures of four rooftop restaurants after serving notices in the past. We will continue inspections at rooftop restaurants which have not been covered under the drive as of now.”

Despite blatant violations, the town planning, enforcement departments and zone offices have ignored the misuse of terrace of the buildings. As per rules, any such use of terrace is not allowed and the violation attracts stringent action under MRTP Act.

157,['9/03/2020'],Visakhapatnam homes now turn ‘smart’ with Internet-linked devices,"Architects and civil engineers are of the opinion that the trend of using IoT is here to stay.

VISAKHAPATNAM: It was ‘ Aditya 369 ’— a 1991 Telugu science fiction film directed by Singeetham Srinivasa which had attempted to paint the picture of a remote-controlled futuristic universe. In 2020, with rapid strides in technology, we are gradually inching towards that future.

Home-based applications with the support of IoT ( Internet of Things ) are gaining popularity all over the world, including Visakhapatnam. Apartments, commercial buildings including hospitals and hotels are gradually adopting this technology with the primary purposes of enhancing security and conserving energy.

As per NASSCOM, the number of IoT devices in India is expected to increase significantly from 200 million units in 2016 to 2.7 billion units by 2020. NASSCOM claims that adoption of these devices will make India a leader within this space. The IoT market in the country is poised to reach US$ 15 billion by 2020, accounting for 5 per cent of the global industry.

Architects and civil engineers are of the opinion that the trend of using IoT is here to stay and it will gradually transform lived experience with greater reliance on technology.

Karuna Kumari, a senior architect with Anuhya Architects and Interiors said that innovation and invention are necessary to save time and energy and these materials are cost-effective, strong and eco-friendly; therefore leading to their adoption across multiple sectors.

“We suggest cost-effective and environment-friendly methods in our plans. Some accept them, while some don’t. But IoT will be the future of the construction sector,” Karuna told TOI.

Peela Koteswara Rao, executive member of Credai, Visakhapatnam chapter said that the construction sector is taking up IoT in the city. “At present, it is mostly hospitals, villas, hotels and companies that are using IoT, primarily for security purposes. We hope that IoT in home appliances also make entry into domestic constructions like apartments and homes soon,” Rao added.

O Naresh Kumar, CEO of Symbiosis Technologies said, “I have ordered IoT-based home appliances, including a security system for my home and company. These will help save electricity and improve security.”

Meanwhile, Samir Kakkar, director, Legrand India— an IoT electrical and digital building appliances’ retail unit in the city, said that these products are becoming affordable and with low internet costs, IoT devices will get more popular with time.

Addressing a press conference, Kejriwal said that the government had earmarked 168 beds in 25 hospitals — 19 government and six private — for Covid-19 patients.“Three cases of novel coronavirus have been reported in the capital so far. One case is still under investigation. Delhi government is worried about it but we are fully prepared to tackle it. There is no need to panic and we need everyone’s cooperation,” the chief minister said after the taskforce meeting.The taskforce was set up by the chief minister on March 4 to tackle the spread of novel coronavirus in the capital. It includes top officials of different departments concerned, the municipal corporations and Delhi Police.Since most of the patients so far have a history of international travel, the chief minister has urged people to inform the state government if anybody in their neighbourhood has returned from abroad in the past fortnight.The chief minister said that after examining the three cases, it was found that the first infected person came in contact with 105 people and the second with 168. The third person came in contact with 64 people in the last 14 days. “They are being isolated and checked for symptoms,” he added.Delhi government has deployed 40 doctors at the airport to screen passengers. “So far, 1,40,603 air passengers have been screened and put on surveillance,” Kejriwal said.He also appealed to employers to give paid leaves to all those quarantined so that their livelihood is not affected.Kejriwal said that 25 hospitals have facilities where people can submit their samples if they develop the symptoms of coronavirus. “We are ensuring separate facilities for collection of samples and treatment in these hospitals so that if any patient arrives there, he/she doesn’t come in contact with others,” he said.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said those who have no symptoms of the disease need not panic. “Only people who have returned from abroad and have symptoms are required to give samples in the hospitals,” he added.Following media reports that there is a huge rush of people to buy masks and hand sanitisers due to the scare, Kejriwal said that healthy people are not required to wear masks. He urged people to wash their hands frequently with soap and water.The state government has also announced a 24x7 state-level control room helpline.

159,['9/03/2020'],‘Teach children values to make them good citizens’,"Vidarbha Sahitya Sangh held a seminar to mark Women’s Day

Nagpur: Parents today are quite confused about raising their children. Should they conform to traditional values or adopt a modern approach? This confusion is making young generation confused too and in this chaos, the right values are not being taught to children. This is why the atrocities against women are increasing, said famous ghazal singer Vishnu Solanke on Saturday.

Speaking as the chief guest at a seminar organized by Vidarbha Sahitya Sangh Library on the stance of literature on rising atrocities against women to mark International Women’s Day, he said children are needed to be taught importance of values to become good citizens.

Solanke talked about sexism and patriarchy which has been going on since ancient times and is still prevalent. “Unfortunately, the emotional trials and tribulations faced by women are quite disregarded. There was so much injustice done to Urmila, wife of Laxman in epic Ramayana. But no one knows about it. Today, the condition is no different,” he said.

Lawyer Gaurav Khond was of the opinion that literature today is also manifested in the form of short films and web series. “Lack of censorship on these platforms is exposing young minds to immoral activities. It is a big cause for crime against women.

Amruta Indurkar, a lecturer, said atrocities against women can be physical and mental in nature. “Causing mental and physical abuse, rape and harming the dignity of a woman are all forms of atrocities.” She cited the examples of writers such as Pratima Joshi and Monica Gajendragadkar who have highlighted the plight of women in their literary works.

Suruchi Dabir and Madan Kulkarni also spoke at the event.

Shubhada Shankhye, PI (Bharosa Cell) was felicitated for contribution to the uplift of women.

162,['9/03/2020'],Coronavirus fails to dampen Holi spirit in Bareilly,"Locals throng market in Bareilly’s Civil Lines on Sunday

BAREILLY: At a time when coronavirus (covid-19) scare has gripped the country and with confirmed and suspected cases being reported every day, Bareilly residents hardly seem to be deterred and have set the market abuzz with their shopping spree ahead of Holi. Preparation for Holika Dahan is going on in full swing and people in several localities were seen playing Holi, even as the festival a couple of days away.

As people, including schoolchildren and college students, have started pouring colours on each other, doctors have advised them to avoid being a part of big gatherings and coming in close contact with people as a precautionary measure.

Shopkeepers, in the meanwhile, said the footfall in markets is usual — like any other festival — and people are turning up to buy sweets, colours, etc. Besides, clubs, restaurants and hotels are being decked up and special arrangements are being made for food, parties, dance and various other activities in anticipation of high footfall.

Talking about the preparations, director of Bareilly Palace hotel Shrawan Agarwal told TOI, “Fortunately, no coronavirus case has been reported in the region, so there is no major impact. Like every year, this year too we have received bookings for Holi, though there won’t be huge gatherings.”

Owner of East Lite hotel in Civil Lines Nikhil Thapar, however, said they were avoiding bookings for Holi because of coronavirus scare. “People come in close contact while playing Holi, which should be avoided as a precautionary measure.”

Markets in several city areas such as Bara Bazaar, Civil Lines, Qutubkhana and others witnessed heavy footfall. “People are coming for shopping as Holi is just a day away. The number of visitors is likely to surge tomorrow. There is no significant change in the number of people visiting markets. Everyone seems to be in celebratory mode,’ said Amit Agarwal, a shopkeeper in Civil Lines.

Meanwhile, taking a precautionary measure, the health department has set up a 300-bed hospital in Bareilly to quarantine suspected cases of coronavirus. Following the government instructions that such containment zone for hosting mass patients should be built away from the populous area, the 300-bed hospital has been set up in an under-construction building.

Advising people to take utmost precaution while celebrating Holi, Bareilly chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Vineet Shukla said, “There are high chances of contamination in social gatherings. While playing Holi people come in close contact with each other, which they should avoid as virus remain active on the wet surface. Even if people are attending parties and joining gatherings, they should keep themselves dry and avoid close contacts.”

HYDERABAD: The Congress has charged the TRS government of making inflated budgetary allocations on paper to project itself as a welfare-oriented government. They said that the government did not have the money to implement the schemes as it was already debt-ridden.

“Budgetary allocations are mere projections and we have serious doubts whether the TRS-government will actually release the money allocated in the budget ,” Congress floor leader in the assembly Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka said and termed the enhance allocations an eyewash.

“When the average growth rate of the of the budget outlay was 15% between 2014-15 and 2018-19, when the economy was vibrant, how can it grow to 29% in 2020-21 when the economic slowdown has dented the state’s revenue and share of central funds have been cut by over Rs 3,000 crore?” Bhatti sought to know.

Former minister Mohammed Ali Shabbir also termed the budget unrealistic and said the TRS government makes allocations but spends nothing. He also slammed that government for slashing outlay for welfare of minorities. “When the government can increase its spending by over Rs 40,000 crore under other heads, then why was minorities’ welfare budget slashed,” the former minister said.

Till now, it was used only to provide information to fishermen about the weather perils and catch information while in mid-sea. However, the improved communication device will now be two-ways, with fishermen being able to provide crucial information to security agencies on the coasts.

GEMINI is the mariner navigation and information device enabled through GAGAN and developed by Hyderabad-based Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS).

Talking to TOI, scientist at INCOIS, Nimit Kumar said: “The ocean is not used only for fishing, but for activities that may hurt our national security. Currently we have bandwidth limitation because we are using AAI satellite for the purpose. ISRO, meanwhile, is developing a satellite for us. So, when we get our own dedicated satellite we plan to provide two-way communication through this device in which the Indian boat can give distress signals to coast guard or navy. The security agency will also be able to verify about any boat that it’s Indian or not.”

According to INCOIS sources, this technology will provide digital identity to the Indian boats in the next few years. At present, the only identification mark for Indian boats is the national Tricolour, a system that has been prevalent for the last 200 years.

This digital identification will also put an end to false claims of Indian boats being captured in foreign waters, they said.

NASHIK: As many as 34 people from Nashik city were cheated of Rs 6.44 lakh by an unknown person, who, under the garb of sending online payments , siphoned off the money from the victims’ accounts.

According to the cyber police, Nashik, the accused had managed to gain the trust of the victims by making small payments for buying a product put up for sale through online e-commerce websites by the complainants. This was followed by the request for payment to complete the deal. But the complainants failed to understand that the request was actually for making payments to the accused and thus they lost their money.

The cases were reported between September 1, 2019, and March 3, 2020. A total of 34 complainants had put up their goods for sale on e-commerce websites.

The police said that all these complainants either have some business or they put up their personal goods for sale online.

The accused would call them up and fix the deal. Once the deal was settled, the accused would send the money across immediately to strike a deal. The accused would then ask them to make the payments with more concrete payment mode, which he would claim was a reliable one. He would ask them to accept the request only.

He then would send a QR code to the accused, which, actually was a request to make payment.

“This was the trick the accused used to cheat the victims. The complainants failed to understand what the request was for and they accepted it. The acceptance resulted in the making of payments – from the complainants to the accused,” the police said.

BAREILLY: In an attempt to make power consumers pay their electricity bills on time, the power department has set a target of cracking down on at least 25 defaulters every day to recover the dues. Besides, power corporation officials have also been directed to disconnect supply of consumers having arrears of Rs 3,000 or more with immediate effect.

According to the information from the power department, there are 1.82 lakh consumers in urban areas and 1.12 lakh in rural areas in Bareilly district. Thousands of these consumers have outstanding bills, said officials.

Speaking with TOI, Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (MVVNL), superintending engineer (rural) Tariq Jalil said, “Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) director (distribution), Vijay Kumar, had visited the city earlier this week and discussed various issues pertaining to line loss, electricity supply, power theft and bill arrears. As pending power dues is a major issue, directions were issued to chalk out a plan to recover the money in the city and sensitize people about the need for paying their bills in time.”

Now, Jalil said, for recovering power dues, linesmen deputed on feeders will be entrusted with the task of recovering electricity dues from at least 25 power consumers every day in urban and rural areas.

Disconnection of supply to consumers who have run up bills up to Rs 10,000 or more was initiated earlier, Jalil said. The limit has now been reduced to Rs 3,000.

BHOPAL: Amid the ongoing political upheaval, BJP has decided to field two candidates for the three Rajya Sabha seats in Madhya Pradesh that will go to polls on March 26. A meeting of BJP state election committee chaired by newly appointed state president V D Sharma, convened here on Sunday at the party’s state head office, forwarded fifteen names in the panel for the two seats. BJP’s central election committee will finalise the names, he said.

According to sources, among the prominent names under consideration for Rajya Sabha by the saffron party are national general secretaries Ram Madhav and Prabhat Jha, national vice presidents Uma Bharti and Kailash Vijayvargiya , state leaders Vinod Gotia, Omprakash Dhurve and Deepak Vijayvargiya.

“We have decided to contest two Rajya Sabha seats in the upcoming elections to the Upper House. We are hopeful to win one and keeping our options open for the other seat. We are quite confident to win the other seats too,” Sharma told TOI.

Sharma added that the election committee members had spoken to some claimants over phone and in person after which a tentative list of candidates was prepared to be forwarded to the central election committee. The meeting was attended by leader of Opposition (LoP) Gopal Bhargava, Rajya Sabha member Prabhat Jha, former state chief Satyanarayan Jatia and former minister and MLA Rajendra Shukla .

Going by the numbers, BJP has 107 members in the state assembly and require at least 58 votes to win one seat. For two seats, the party needs support of 116 MLAs which will require support of nine additional MLAs to win the second Rajya Sabha seat. BJP’s decision to contest two seats came amid high political drama in the state where the party is being accused of horse-trading to lure Congress MLAs.

BJP is also under threat of losing two of its MLAs, including Narayan Tripathi from Maihar and Sharad Kol from Beohari, who had voted earlier with the Congress and are keeping a constant touch with chief minister Kamal Nath. This is a serious cause of concern for the saffron party, said sources.

Both BJP and the ruling Congress have chalked out a strategy to keep their flock of MLAs together to prevent any cross-voting in the Rajya Sabha polls. BJP leadership has also asked the legislators to stay alert and promptly inform them in case they are approached by the rival camp in connection with the elections. Both the parties will win one seat each and the real tussle is for the third seat.

The Congress with 114 members in the assembly has support of four independents, including two BSP and one SP members that takes its tally in the House to 121. Two seats are currently vacant in the 230-member house. The Congress will require support of only two additional members to win a second seat. However, amid discontentment in the party, as some MLAs are still missing even after five days after the political drama unfolded, the Congress is yet to finalise names for the Rajya Sabha elections.

“We are winning two Rajya Sabha seats as all the Congress MLAs and our alliance partners have assured support to us. The BJP will be wiped out in the elections,” claimed state public relations minister PC Sharma, on Sunday.

HYDERABAD: The budget has come as disappointment for the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Boards (HMWS&SB). As against the water board’s demand for Rs 2,150 crore, the allocation in the current budget stood at just above Rs 900 crore. However, the water board can hope to see a share of the Rs 10,000 crore corpus allocated for the development of Hyderabad.

Except for the repayment of Hudco loans, allocations for key projects such as the laying of a 158km pipeline along ORR, construction of Keshavapuram reservoir, implementation of the water safety plan , construction of STPs in GHMC’s peripheral areas and others were absent in the budget.

The water board had taken loans of around Rs 3,500 crore from Hudco for the completion of three phases under the Krishna Drinking Water Supply scheme and one phase of the Godavari Drinking Water Supply Scheme. “In the 2020-21 budget, the state government has allocated just above Rs 900 crore for the repayment of these loans,” a senior water board official told TOI. “Daily water supply to Hyderabad, areas in GHMC periphery and along ORR may become difficult given meagre allocation of funds,” a retired HMW&SB official said.

BAREILLY: Coming down heavily on some illegal brick kilns in Rampur and Sambhal districts, Moradabad Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has levied a hefty penalty of Rs 3.15 crore, around Rs 15 lakh each.

According to information from the regional pollution control board, inspections were conducted on March 6, 2020, which revealed that 20 brick kilns were operating against the guidelines of Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) and were polluting the air as they lacked adequate pollution control mechanism.

Speaking to TOI on Sunday, UPPCB regional officer, Moradabad, Ajay Sharma said, “Inspections were carried out on March 6 after receiving information about rampant operations of unauthorized brick kilns in Sambhal and Rampur districts. As many as 20 such brick furnaces were identified to be violating UPPCB norms. The erring kilns lacked proper mechanism to curb air pollution being emitted from these furnaces while all of them were being operated without pollution board’s consent.”

The regional officer added, “The identified kilns did not follow several high court orders pertaining to operations nor did they adhere to the guidelines set by pollution control board. Since none of them had acquired a legit no-objection certificate from UPPCB and no legal procedure was being followed, a penalty of Rs 3.15 crore has been imposed. Twenty erring brick kilns have been pulled up for violating regulations. A detailed report has been forwarded to the headquarters to initiate further legal action against the unauthorized kilns and shut its operations. Further orders are now awaited.”

In February, UPPCB had levied a hefty penalty of Rs 9.58 crore (Rs 1.36 crore each) on seven godown operators for illegally storing animal skins, triggering air pollution and flouting pollution board norms in residential areas of Moradabad.

NASHIK: The Nashik division of the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) has installed 1,840 solar power pumps to enable the farmers to pump out groundwater during the daytime.

The solar pumps have been allotted to the farmers, who paid for the new connections but did not receive it.

The solar pumps were sanctioned through central government’s Atal Solar Krishi Pump Yojana and state government’s Mukhyamantri Saur Krushi Pump Yojana in which the farmers had to pay less than 10 percent of the total costs of the pump. The same was also warranted for a period of five years.

Out of the total 1,840 solar pumps allotted, 1049 pumps were installed in Nashik, 195 pumps in Malegaon while 596 pumps in Ahmednagar circle.

The MSEDCL officers further pointed out that the Nashik circle had large numbers of farmers and the land was also well irrigated, while the Malegaon circle was largely dry. The Ahmednagar district is vast in terms of geographical dimensions, but even this region falls in the rain shadow region and hence the demand for the pumps was limited.

The solar pumps ensure the farmers do not have to rely on the power supply, especially in the backdrop of the power-sharing issue. “There is a regular complaint of the farmers about the lack of voltage, or the power supply disruption due to failed transformer, have to wait for a couple of days before the transformer is reinstated. The worst part is that the farmers are forced to water their plants in the night – which happens turn-by-turn,” the MSEDCL officer said.

With solar power the farmers get the power in the day time and get assured supply as well. The farmers do not have to worry about the failed transformers and also about the maintenance of the solar power pumps for the first five years.

When he said he didn’t have enough money, Traya asked him to pay Rs17 lakh to him now and that he would give Soni 2kg gold. But, he said the gold will be delivered to Soni only in Ahmedabad. He told Soni to pay the remaining amount after reaching Jaipur,” said R N Khant, inspector, Bhuj police.

However, the driver never returned and Soni realized that he had been duped.

Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, who had a meeting with Poonam Khetrapal Singh, the regional director of WHO, on Sunday said he apprised her of the extensive capacity building efforts as part of the government’s mission-mode preparedness. “… I assured her that India is using speed, scale and determination coupled with best practices to push back #corona,” he tweeted.

On Saturday, PM Narendra Modi had reviewed the coronavirus situation in the country at a meeting with officials and directed them to identify locations for sufficient quarantine facilities and make provisions for critical care in case the disease spread further.

Sources said all top private hospitals have also been asked to be ready to handle Covid-19 cases. Dr V K Paul, member, Niti Aayog, told TOI the private hospitals have agreed to create facilities. “We need to be prepared for the worse while doing our best to contain the disease,” he said.

In Delhi, six private hospitals, including Max super speciality, Apollo and BLK hospital, have already created isolation wards. In Gurugram, Medanta Medicity has created an isolation ward where 14 out of 16 Italian nationals who tested positive for coronavirus are being treated.

While 80% Covid-19 cases are mild to moderate, a WHO-China Joint Mission Report released recently shows 14% develop severe symptoms like shortness of breath and 6% turn critical with symptoms like respiratory failure, septic shock and/or multi-organ dysfunction or failure.

“Individuals at highest risk for severe disease and death include people aged above 60 years and those with underlying conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer,” the report says.

187,['9/03/2020'],International Women’s Day celebrated across state,"Dehradun: On the occasion of International Women’s Day on Sunday, several awareness programmes and celebratory events honouring the city’s girls and women unfolded across Dehradun.

Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat inaugurated the “Poshan Pakhwada 2020”, organized by the state ministry of women and child development. This is the second edition of the nutrition campaign in the state. Speaking at the event, the CM addressed the issue of malnutrition among girls. “There is a need to create awareness among women and girls regarding anaemia. Programmes like Poshan Pakhwada should regularly be conducted to create awareness,” Rawat said, as he unveiled the ministry’s mascot “Saruli Bua” and released some short films in Garhwali and Hindi language on the prevention of anaemia.

“Dieticians should be present in the fairs taking place across the state and create awareness among women, so they can eventually prevent malnutrition. The state government schemes for women empowerment should also be promoted properly, so that nobody is deprived of the benefits,” Rawat added.

Meanwhile, the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI) organised free clinics for policewomen who aren’t able to take proper care of their health due to long duty hours. The cops were offered free gynaecological consultation and breast-cancer check ups. Apart from Dehradun, the clinics were set up in Rampur, Haridwar, Rudrapur, Kashipur and Haldwani as well. Nearly 2,000 policewomen took part.

At a women’s day event inside the Survey of India premises in Hathibarkala, governor Baby Rani Maurya said in her address that given the right opportunities, women can flourish as well as men. “Women can truly be made strong only by the means of education. If girls get the support of their parents and the right opportunities, they can scale numerous heights in life. I appeal to all parents to give freedom to their girls to hone their talent, so that they can achieve big in life,” Maurya said in her speech.

Villages in the outskirts of Dehradun had a unique way of celebrating women’s day. Families with only daughters were felicitated, as were widows. Almost 80 women were felicitated amid the message of “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao” in one such event in Galjwadi village.

In Tapkeshwar temple, too, several programmes were held to create awareness among women regarding hormonal imbalance and stress-related issues.

BHOPAL: Amid the political turmoil in the state with Congress and BJP trying to get even with each other, BJP MLA from Maihar Narayan Tripathi is leaving no stone unturned to embarass his party. Tripathi on Sunday met chief minister Kamal Nath, the third time in last three days, and claimed that Congress government in Madhya Pradesh is in ‘full majority’ and there is no crisis.

After meeting Nath at his official resident, Tripathi told waiting reporters that he had urged the chief minister him to approve Maihar as new district. He said, “Kamal Nath-led Congress government is in full majority. I met CM to ask for naming Maihar as a new district and discuss about a resolution in the assembly on the formation of a separate Vindhya State.”

The BJP leader who had supported the Congress sponsored bill in the state assembly during a voice-vote on an amendment and also praised Kamal Nath for his decisions, said that the chief minister gave a patient hearing to his demands. “I had demanded that the new district be notified before the budget session of MP Assembly. CM has assured for naming Maihar a new district. There are few more proposals for new districts and all these proposals will be taken up together,"" said Tripathi.

The BJP MLA has openly supported the Congress government against the party’s wish.

“When I met chief minister Kamal Nath ji at his residence, Bisahulal ji (referring to senior Congress MLA Bisahulal Singh , who was said to be missing for the past few days during the political drama) was also there,” Tripathi told reporters.

The BJP leader however, did not respond to queries on his loyalty to his party and whom would he support in the forthcoming Rajya Sabha elections. ""This will be decided during the course of the budget session. For Rajya Sabha, will take a decision when the time comes,"" he said.

Tripathi had also called on chief minister Kamal Nath on Friday and Saturday. He was spotted by the reporters with minister Honey Singh Baghel at the Nath’s official residence at Shyamla Hills. However, he had claimed that he is a BJP MLA and would continue to support his party.

The BJP has meanwhile claimed that Tripathi is very much in the party fold. ""Nobody is going anywhere. All BJP MLAs are with the party and supporting the party too,"" said BJP state spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal.

Arvind’s name had also cropped up in alleged horse-trading attempts levelled by Congress against BJP, for toppling the government.

Sources said a police team went to the residence of Bhadoria and summoned his brother Devendra Singh Bhadoria to the CSP office on Saturday. Later, Devendra Singh stayed at the Kotwali police station for nearly 45 minutes before heading back home.

SP Bhind, Nagendra Singh said, “It was only a routine process as some information regarding a case had to be sought from him. We discussed about it and then he left for home.”

Sources from the police, however said that the questioning of Devendra Singh Bhadoria was in relation to the missing person FIR registered at Bhopal against a Congress MLA. It was suspected that Arvind Bhadoria could be aware of it and since Bhadoria was also not present in Ater, his brother was summoned for inquiry about the whereabouts of Arvind Bhadoria, following a query from Bhopal, said sources.

On March 3, Congress has alleged that a group of BJP leaders have allegedly offered money to Congress MLAs to switch sides. Congress alleged some BJP leaders, along with former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and former minister Narottam Mishra, were present at the hotel in Manesar in Haryana where eight to 10 Congress MLAs were staying in the night of March 3.

The accused, identified as Shakaria Samaliya (46), was arrested after the body of Kamlesh Chauhan (40) was found in a well near a check dam on the outskirts of Jhanjhmer village on Saturday.

Cops arrested Samaliya as he was the last person to have been seen with the deceased. Chauhan’s wife Kamali told the police that Samaliya had taken Chauhan for a fishing and liquor party on Thursday evening.

However, after Chauhan failed to return home the next day, Kamali started searching for him and asked Samaliya about her husband’s whereabouts. The accused feigned ignorance, she alleged. Then the villagers informed her about the recovery of a body in the well near the check dam.

When the body was fished out, Kamali identified it to be her husband. On Saturday night, Kamali lodged a police complaint in which she named Samaliya as the accused.

“We arrested Samaliya from Dhoraji from where he was planning to flee. During interrogation, Samaliya told the police that he killed Chauhan as he was allegedly having had an illicit relationship with his daughter. Samaliya said that he had first got Chauhan drunk and then bludgeoned him to death. After this, he threw Chauhan’s body in the well,” said V H Joshi, inspector, Dhoraji police station.

The UNESCO-tagged monuments got a facelift and tourists flocked to the ancient town in droves — several taking photographs at the very spots the two leaders had posed. But 150 days later, Mamallapuram has gone back in time, again — the Pallava-era monuments are in a state of neglect, battling bat droppings and vandals.Drastic cut in the number of casual workers hired for maintenance and security by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has left these monuments unattended. For instance, bas-relief art works in Mahishamardhini rock cut Mandapam on the hillock in the backyard of Arjuna Penance is infested by bats. Their droppings on shoulders of the sculpture is rolling down to rest of the structure inside the cave, changing the colour of stone. It is one of the 35 monuments declared as a world heritage site by Unesco .A site at Saluvankuppam — that had thrived during Sangam, Pallava and Chola rule for about 1,300 years till 14th century AD — unfenced rocks with ancient Tamil inscriptions near Tiger Cave has become an open-air bar for tipplers. Empty liquor bottles are strewn around the ASI site comprising an excavated ancient Murugan temple on East Coast Road.M Manimaran, a resident of Pudhu Nemmeli Kuppam, said people passing by the spot often stop to unwind and drink.“A security guard takes care of the Tiger Cave and the temple. Another man used to clean trash every day but I did not see for one week,” said another villager.But last year, before the summit, all the monuments had come under a heightened security. ASI cleaned up the monuments and had deployed 43 workers — one per monument — for maintenance. However, only 13 individuals are on duty since January, ASI sources said. The security apparatus has been confined to ticketed monuments but none of these monuments has CCTV cameras for protection.Former ASI epigraphist S Rajavelu, whose discovery of Tamil inscriptions led to the excavation of ancient Murugan Temple at Saluvankuppam post the 2004 Tsunami, said monuments that were kept unattended would be destroyed.“The monolithic temples and stone art works at Mamallapuram are one of the oldest and rarest monuments in the world. If they are not subjected to periodic chemical conservation, our privileged heritage would be lost forever,” Rajavelu, an adjunct faculty at the department of history in Alagappa University , Karaikudi, said.When contacted, ASI superintending archaeologist of Chennai Circle A M V Subramanyam said ASI was “serious” about maintenance and conservation. “There is no neglect of monuments and the chemical branch of ASI would carry out conservation work in a couple of months at Mamallapuram.

HYDERABAD: A chargesheet that had been served to T Maruti Rao on February 29, in connection with the alleged honour killing of his son-in law Pranay Kumar , is said to have caused Maruti severe stress. His family suspects that this could have led to him taking his life in an Arya Vysya Bhavan room on Sunday.

Maruti is known to have broken down several times regarding the issue, even in the presence of a local advocate.

The case was scheduled to heard by a local court on Tuesday and a decision on framing of charges was to be taken. Maruti was on the lookout for a suitable lawyer to fight his case and was travelling to Hyderabad to meet an advocate on Sunday. On his way to Hyderabad he purchased a bottle of pesticide which he consumed in the Arya Vysya Bhavan room.

Maruti’s daughter Amrutha had filed a petition in High Court several days ago requesting the court to direct the trial court to conclude the case at the earliest. The Nalgonda police had filed a chargesheet against Maruti and other accused in June 2019. Maruti who was out on bail for the last several months was initially arrested a few days after Pranay’s murder on the charge of engaging hired assailants.

Maruti’s brother Shravan said that the former was worried about not being given enough time to plan a response to the 1,600 page chargesheet. Shravan also denied all rumours of property disputes between the brothers.

“ We do not know the exact reason for his suicide but we suspect he committed suicide due to stress about the case,’’ Shravan said. Maruti’s wife Girija who broke down on seeing her husband’s body was consoled by a large number of people who visited Maruti’s residence in Miryalguda .

Responding to Amrutha’s reaction that her father might had committed suicide due to regret, Shravan asked, “What wrong did my brother do to feel regret?’’

The veterinaries have sent the samples from the dead birds to Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals in Bengaluru for confirmation of the disease.

Ranikhet is a viral disease found only in painted storks, a migratory bird.

Mahaveer Ramaprasad, corporator, Ward No 55 said: “In the past ten days, nearly eight to ten migratory birds have died. I immediately brought it to the notice of veterinarians who in turn visited the spot and sent the samples to Bengaluru.”

Dr Nagaraj, assistant director, veterinary hospital, Chamundipuram, told TOI “When we got information from the local corporator about the death of migratory birds, we rushed to the spot. These birds died on February 28 and 29. On Saturday too, two birds died. The migratory birds come to nearby sewage water bodies and later in the evening they stay on two trees. They leave in the morning. They might have died while resting in the trees. We are keeping a watch on other birds but we have not got any report about more deaths other than the six painted storks. If it is Ranikhet disease, it is not communicable to human beings. We have trimmed the tree and have told the concerned authorities to make it more hygienic. We are expecting results from the laboratory by Monday or Tuesday.”

He also said that it is the first time that deaths of painted storks have been reported in such numbers in Mysuru.

Tourists come with masks

Meanwhile, most tourists visiting Mysuru are found wearing masks, possibly as a preventive measure against coronavirus.

Narayanagowda, president of Hotel Owners Association, said: “Compared to last year, there is 20 to 30% less tourists this year. In February and March the inflow of tourists is generally less due to exams. However, this year, there is a further dip in tourist arrivals, possibly due to the scare over coronavirus.”

RAMPUR: A top Army officer has requested the grandson of the erstwhile Nawab of Rampur to consider gifting the recently-found large cache of rare antique guns, swords, knives and other items for display at Army museums.

The request from the Army brass comes against the backdrop of ongoing division of properties among the family members of the erstwhile Rampur Nawab. One after another strong rooms are being thrown open under the watchful eyes of district officials. After a prolonged legal battle, the Supreme Court had in July 2019 directed division of assets among the family members of the erstwhile Nawab.

In the first week of February, the locks of Armoury in the family’s Khasbagh Palace were opened. Hundreds of carved vintage guns, gem-studded swords, knives with handles made of precious stones were found in the room. According to collectors, it is a minefield of antiquity. The rare firearms are more than a century old and have been manufactured by renowned names, like Charles Lancaster, Henry Marton, Colt, Manchester , Rifle & Co., Buckgnot Enfield , Holland & Holland, W&C Scott London, HW Marton, CC Smith, RT Martimer, Greener, S & Smith, John Manton London, Thomas Smith, Wellington & Sons.

The letter, requesting the Nawab’s descendant to donate the antique arms, came from Lt Gen N S Raja Subramani, AVSM, SM, VSM General Officer Commanding (Uttar Bharat).

Quoting a TOI report into his letter written to Nawab Kazim Ali Khan-- the grandson of the erstwhile Nawab of Rampur-- the Army officer said, “May I, therefore request you to kindly consider gifting these items of military interest after consultation with all royal family members. I can assure you that these items will find a pride place in our museums and army institutions with a plaque of Rampur state.”

“I look forward to hearing from you,” Lt Gen Subramani said.

Nawab Kazim expressed willingness to donate the antique arms. But he is not the only stakeholder.

“I have received the letter from Lt Gen Subramani and it is a great honour for our family that the weaponry of our ancestors will be kept and displayed in the museums of the Indian Army. I have informed other family members about the letter. Soon, we will unanimously take decision on this matter.”

“If all goes well, the weaponry is expected to be displayed in the Army museums at Bareilly, Lucknow and New Delhi,” Kazim said.

“A few days ago, when the Armoury was opened, brigadier MS Jodha had come here. We had a discussion about the preservation of our rich cultural heritage. He told us that three large barrel guns of the erstwhile Rampur state are kept inside the Garwhal Regiment Museum at Lansdowne, Uttarakhand,” he said.

Rashid Khan, a local arms dealer, who has also been appointed by the administrative authorities to inspect and count the weapons of the erstwhile princely state, said, “The Armoury is invaluable in terms of antiquity. Muzzle-loading guns, pistols with gold carvings, revolvers, rifles with bayonets and swords forged out of rare metals together make up a collector’s dream.”

198,['9/03/2020'],"As IMFL becomes costly, illicit liquor flows in Agency areas","Picture for representational purpose only.

VISAKHAPATNAM: The demand for illicit liquor is on the rise in Agency areas in Visakhapatnam and neighbouring districts following the implementation of the new excise policy and the rise in price of Indian-made foreign liquor ( IMFL ).

An excise official said, “Earlier there had been not much demand for such illicit liquor, such as arrack. But, since October 1, 2019, once the new liquor policy was implemented there has been a steady rise in the price of IMFL. So people, especially residents of the Agency areas, are switching to low quality and cheap illicit liquor.”

Officials also attributed the rise in demand for illicit liquor to the timings and number of ‘off shops’ — a retail store that sells only liquor. At present, government-run liquor shops remain open between 11 am to 8 pm.

In Agency areas, people have to travel long distances to buy IMFL as the number of liquor shops is few and far between.

This has spurred the growth of gangs that illegally manufacture liquor in areas such as Narsipatnam, Chintapalle, Koyyuru, Pederu and Araku.

Although officials of the excise and prohibition department organise raids at regular intervals, the sale of illicit liquor continues due to staff shortage in the department and the large Agency tracts that officials have to cover.

“Around 50 per cent of posts in the department are still vacant. The Agency areas in the districts are quite huge and often it becomes difficult to keep a strict vigil. If we raid one place, the next day they shift their hideouts to another place,” said a senior official.

Since mid-February the department has booked around 30 cases and arrested 20 persons. About 170 litres of arrack and 7,000 litres of jaggery were seized. One litre of arrack is made from 10 litres of fermented jaggery.

“Until and unless the government increases the time limit for ‘off shops’ and reduces the price of IMFL, this problem would persist and will increase. We have to keep a strict vigil to crackdown on this menace,” an official added.

BAREILLY: A 17-year-old girl, who became unconscious after an electric shock, was buried neck-deep in sand for hours by her parents who believed that the “traditional therapy” practiced in the region would make her better. Nazma Khan was making cow-dung cakes in a field when she accidently touched a live wire. She became unconscious and was rescued by women who were also in the field in Zia Nagla village of Bareilly.

But, instead of taking the girl to a nearby hospital, the family members buried her into a heap of sand for hours. The girl had a narrow escape, a health official said, adding that the family had risked her life by believing in the “flawed practice”.

“The idea was to bring down her blood circulation and it works in most of the cases where there is a scope of recovery,” a local said. However, when contacted, chief medical officer of Bareilly, Dr Vineet Shukla, said, “This practice is wrong and may put the life of the victim at risk. The heart of such patient is affected first. We usually give CPR for revival.”

The girl, when she gained the consciousness, was shivering in cold after being kept in the sand for hours. “My daughter is fine now. The traditional treatment worked. We will take her to hospital if needed,” said Shahid Khan, the father.

When contacted, station house officer (SHO) of Shergarh police station, Ashwini Kumar said, “A team will be sent to the village to check the condition of the girl. They didn’t go to hospital and the electricity department was also not informed. We will look into the matter.”

The Dehradun-based twins were among the 15 women who were conferred with the award for their achievements. They were the first women twins to scale Mt Everest in 2013 which gave them the nickname of “Everest Twins”.

The twin sisters have earlier won India’s highest adventure honour — ‘Tenzing Norgay National Adventure Award’ in 2016 and ‘Global Young Explorers Award’ — from the President of Iceland in the same year.

Last year, they were among the nine women sportspersons recommended for the Padma Awards by the sports ministry.

On Sunday, the twins dedicated their award to the resilience and optimism of the girl child. “We climb on behalf of all girls, many of whom are denied their basic human right to survive,” Nungshi said.

Later in the day, they along with other awardees attended an interactive session with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his official residence in New Delhi.

The Nari Shakti Puraskar is given every year to individuals, groups and institutions recognising their exceptional work towards the cause of women empowerment, especially of vulnerable and marginalised women.

203,['9/03/2020'],Coronavirus in Bhopal: Medical fraternity divided over efficacy of masks,"Representative image

BHOPAL: Amid fears of Covid-19 spread, people are stocking up medicines and other emergency essentials anticipating a shortage, although medical experts are of the opinion that items like masks should only be used when a person has symptoms to avoid the spread.

After the Rashtrapati Bhavan decided not to organise the traditional Holi gatherings as a precautionary measure, PM Narendra Modi tweeted that people must be careful about rumours being regarding Covid-19. The state government too has initiated a ‘Namaste, Aadaab’ campaign, asking people to avoid handshake.

But Covid-19 hasn’t deterred people from Holi festivities, which are still being planned with a gusto. “We are organising a massive Holi event and Covid-19 would not dampen the event. We would be cautious for sure and appoint a doctor to detect people with symptoms of Covid-19 at the entrance,” said a Ratibad resort event manager Arun Malviya. Going for a dry and delightful Holi with no water balloons, paints and pichkaris is not on the agenda of many people in Bhopal.

Masks are available in stores, but do they really help is a question on the minds of many. “Doctors are not recommending the measure. Since no vaccines are currently available for Covid-19, the most effective weapon in such a situation seems to be a face mask,” said a pharmacist.

Medical community, however, is divided over the effectiveness of masks, indicating that hand-wash and sanitising surfaces is the best way to keep oneself safe. Going by estimates, there are around 22,000 face masks with the state help department. However, N95 masks are selling for upwards of Rs 300 in some stores.

“There is a spurt in demand of masks. However, it is not like Delhi where things like hand sanitizers have vanished from the market,” said Adtiya, a pharmacist. “Medical supplies for now is being maintained. There are rumours about short supply of essential salts and reagents, but we are witnessing any shortage.”

A representative of MP medical suppliers association Lalit Jain said, “We have urged all sellers and retailers not to hoard and keep the supply lines open, so that prices don’t shoot up.”

PUNE: In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, federations of housing societies have issued notices telling residents to exercise caution while playing Holi this year.

Federations across Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad have advised members to be careful while playing Holi.

Suhas Patwardhan, chairperson of the Pune district cooperative housing federation, said, “In Pune, thankfully there aren’t any cases of novel coronavirus (COVID-19). So, we are telling everyone to be cautious while playing,” he said. The federation has over 18,000 registered cooperative societies.

About the precautions they had issued, Patwardhan said, “We have told people to avoid physical contact. Essentially, we are not discouraging them from playing. But, we are telling them to exercise caution.”

Patwardhan said the public should be careful and avoid crowds. “Most people are aware of the precautions,” he added.

Meanwhile, the Pimpri Chinchwad Housing Societies Federation has also issued similar instructions.

Sudhir Deshmukh, a member, said there were over 100 housing societies registered.

“Rather than discouraging them, we are asking people to be careful while playing. Apart from the usual instructions of playing Holi with eco-friendly colours and not wasting water, we are also telling them that if a person is not feeling well, then s/he should not be playing at all. They should take due care,” Deshmukh said.

Some societies such as the Kondhwa-based Sai Dwarkamai Cooperative Housing Society have organized games for children on Tuesday to avoid the Holi celebrations.

Kanta Kulkarni, chairperson of the housing society, said they had taken a conscious decision to not play Holi this year.

“We have a total of 94 flats and the idea was to spread awareness about coronavirus. We explained to the children why we were not playing Holi and playing games instead to make them understand,” Kulkarni said.

She said residents needed to be alert. “We need to make the children alert too. We will burn a bonfire, but we will not play with the colours. Children love to play. So, instead of Holi celebrations, we have organized housie for them to play,” Kulkarni added.

206,['9/03/2020'],"Hawkers, trash return to pavements of ancient town","CHENNAI: Months after the state and central governments spent crores to renovate Mamallapuram, hawkers have returned to the stake claim of the footpaths. They have encroached the platforms and portions of the carriageway, selling stone sculptures, chappals, snacks and knickknacks.

Ahead of the Modi-Xi meeting, the state government had evicted more than 100 hawkers from the pavements around the Shore Temple.

With the coastal town bustling with tourists throughout the year, especially on weekends, tourists often jostle for space with two-wheelers on the roads and hawkers on the pavements.

Mamallapuram-based tour guide R Boobalan said tourists have begun to complain about poor maintenance and encroachments. “It is no more the renovated Mamallapuram,” he said. Illegal and haphazard parking too is back. Vehicles are parked in no-parking zones opposite Arjuna’s Penance and Krishna Butter Ball, he said.

The civic infrastructure of the town panchayat is proving insufficient to handle the pressure. According official sources with Mamallapuram Town Panchayat, the volume of garbage has increased by one tonne following the jump in the number of tourists.

“We have increased the number of shifts for conservancy workers to ensure trash is removed throughout the day,” a town panchayat official said.

But the beach behind the Shore Temple and the pathway leading to it tell a different story. Littered with trash, the sands have become a no-go zone for tourists who want to go on a bare-feet walk like the Prime Minister, and maybe shoot an Instagram video.

207,['9/03/2020'],When Dancing Girl from Mohenjo-daro was in town,"The Dancing Girl recreated by Majiah Murmu

CHENNAI: A couple of months ago, when Majhia Murmu was asked to make the replica of the Indus Dancing Girl to be presented to the guests as part of a book launch in the city, he was clueless. Even though this Bhubaneswar-based Dokra artist is known for his stunning lost-wax sculptures, he felt a bit embarrassed mainly because of the subject being a prehistoric bronze sculpture (2300-1750 BC) found in the Indus Valley Civilisation city of Mohenjo-daro (in today’s Sindh province of Pakistan).

It was British archaeologist Ernest Mackay who discovered the Dancing Girl in Mohenjo Daro in 1926. The ancient artefact is displayed at the National Museum, New Delhi . The Dancing Girl was one of the two rare ancient bronze sculptures (the other being the figure of a girl currently displayed at Karachi Museum) that was found with some notable and flexible features.

Murmu and his friend Anam Tudu started collecting details about the Dancing Girl. Once started, Murmu didn’t look back. Result: 75 pieces of the Dancing Girl. “I made many sculptures using the lost wax process. But this was a bit challenging mainly because of the significance of the subject. The initial ones didn’t come out well, but I didn’t give up,” said Murmu. Both Murmu and Tudu belong to the Santal tribal community of Mayurbhanj district of Odisha.

The lost wax process to make sculptures has been in existence since the time of Indus Valley Civilization. It is a method of metal casting in which a molten metal is poured into a mould that has been created by means of a wax model. “We had the book launch in Chennai in December 2019 and we wanted to give mementos to people who contributed to this project. We decided to give the replica of Dancing Girl figurine as the memento. When we distributed the statuettes, many praised the way they were recreated by Murmu,” said G Sundar, director of the Roja Muthiah Research Library in the city.

Fascinated by the talent of Murmu, Sundar decided to meet the artist when he visited Bhubaneswar. “I was introduced to a man wearing a T-shirt with dark glasses. He seemed to be cleaning the rough surfaces on a sculpture. When I asked him, he showed me how it was made and to my surprise I found that he was not making a single die for making many pieces,” said Sundar. “The lost wax process involves making as many numbers of wax models to create so many numbers of actual figurines out of them. It’s a laborious process and each sample was made with perfection.”

The production starts with collection of raw materials, which include ant hill clay, fire clay, firewood, paddy straw, cow dung, charcoal, sand, bee wax, raw brass among others. “There are four stages. The unfinished replica needs to be kept out for drying in the sunlight. We use bamboo knife for polishing the half-dried products. We had to do it with extra care as this is a prehistoric model,” said Murmu.

BAREILLY: Constable Ompal Singh has been suspended for allegedly firing at least seven rounds in the air with his service pistol following a heated argument with his colleague near Ganeshpur Devipura on Saturday night.

The constable was deployed at police response vehicle 292 (PRV) in Moradabad district. His medical report suggested that he was drunk. The report was forwarded to senior superintendent of police (SSP) Amit Pathak following which the SSP suspended the constable and ordered a probe. The incident took place under Bhojpur police station limits. SHO Satraj Singh said the constable’s service weapon was taken away immediately after the incident.

The PRV 292 was stationed around 2km from a police station on the Moradabad-Ramnagar highway. After the incident, the PRV’s driver Vipendra drove the vehicle to the nearest police station and informed the SHO.

“The constable had a heated argument with sub-commander Vipin Premi which escalated into a verbal fight and then in a fit of rage constable Ompal pulled out his pistol and fired seven rounds in the air, leaving the other cop stunned,” the SHO said.

The SSP said that consuming alcohol on duty and firing indiscriminately was an act of gross indiscipline. “Area circle officer of Thakurdwara is tasked to probe into the matter. As of now, the constable has been suspended and further action will be taken once the probe is completed,” the SSP added.

JAIPUR: Male tiger, MT-3 that travelled around 150km from Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (RTR) is suffering a grievous injury on its head.

The wound is now infested with maggots and a forest team is trying to trace the big cat to treat the injury. According to sources, “On Saturday, the tracking team saw the wound on the forehead of MT-3. It was bleeding and the animal cannot lick the wound as it is out of reach.”

Following this, the team from Ranthambore was pressed into operation to rescue the animal. However, the search and rescue operation is yet to be successful as the tiger is yet to be found. “Blood samples were collected from the area where the tiger was last seen. It appears the wound is maggot-infested,” a source said.

As the injury appeared on the peculiar spot, the forest officials are not ruling out the possibility of a snare. “There are many villages, including Ghati and Mashalpura, which have a history of snaring. The demand for bushmeat has always been there and local poachers often use this technique. It is possible the tiger got entangled in the snares meant to kill herbivores for bushmeat by local poachers,” the source added.

T-98, which is now known as MT-3, is the offspring of T-60 of RTR and is around four years old.

The injury has also exposed the glaring chink in tiger monitoring at MHTR as the collar of the tiger is not functioning. “Had the collar been working, the tiger could have been traced and timely treatment could have been provided,” said a forest staff on condition of anonymity

Male tiger T-98 that had strayed from and reached Ghati village of Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve (MHTR) in February last year was collared and released in the Darrah range, but the collar is not functioning at present which is making it difficult to locate the tiger.

RAJKOT: Four persons, including a minor, were booked under the Official Secrets Act for spying after they allegedly clicked photographs near the Naliya Indian Air Force (IAF) base in Kutch district.

It was in January that the IAF personnel had caught the four persons on the outskirts of Mothala village of Abdasa taluka and handed them to the police over suspicion that they were spying the sensitive defence area.

Police said the four identified as Rafiq Azam (23), Abbas Padhiyar (19), Arbaz Sumra (20) and a 17-year-old were booked on Sunday. Padhiyar and the minor are students, while Sumra runs a cellphone shop in Naliya.

The four are, however, yet to be arrested.

“The accused were allegedly taking photographs and videos of the radar and air strip of the IAF base by climbing up the terrace of a house near the IAF base. We are probing whether they have sent the photographs to someone in Pakistan or elsewhere,” said A R Zala, sub-inspector with Bhuj special operation group (SOG).

At the time of detention, cops seized two digital cameras and four smart phones from their possession.

“We have sent the cameras and cellphones for forensic examination. We are also probing the social media accounts of the four to find out with whom they were in touch,” added Zala.

An IAF jawan, manning the watch tower of the IAF base, spotted the four men with the cameras on the terrace of the house and saw them clicking photos of the prohibited area on January 29.

The jawan then alerted his seniors who sent IAF personnel to the spot and detained the four. The IAF then handed them over to the Naliya police station, which took the application of complaint in this regard and gave the investigation to Bhuj SOG.

However, as espionage charges could not be established against four at that time, the cops had let them off. But, after Bhuj SOG investigated the case and found that that they had indeed taken photographs and videos for espionage. A case was registered under section 3 of the Official Secrets Act that deals with penalties for spying at a prohibited place.

Inspector Ashok Shelke of the Haveli police said Jayesh Ramrao Bhandare (23) was from Nashik and staying at Vadgaon Budruk. He said Bhandare was a third-year engineering student at a college in Narhe.

The officer said Bhandare and four of his friends wrote the final paper of their third-year exam on Saturday and reached the canal site on bikes. Though three of them knew swimming, Bhandare and another didn’t know. They waded into the water on seeing the low level in the canal.

The level in the canal suddenly increased, as the irrigation department released more water into it. Bhandare was washed away by its current. His friends tried to save him, but in vain. They alerted the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority ’s fire brigade and the Haveli police. Fire brigade and police officers continued a search operation till late in the night.

216,['9/03/2020'],MP Government moots law to make construction on private land legal,"Representative image

BHOPAL: Dealing with haphazard diversion of land and growth of illegal colonies over the past 15-years, Madhya Pradesh government is mooting a legislation that would provide relief and legalise constructions on private land that was not in planned area.

Sources said that this order would be applicable only for individual constructions and not illegal colonisers.

“Master plan is a guideline document. As for illegal colonies, government is looking at a legislation that would cater to legalise constructions on private land,” said MP urban administration, principal secretary, Sanjay Dubey.

While the measure would not impact large colonies, in the short term, it would provide relief to independent constructions, to bring them into some sort of planned town development, indicate urban development experts.

“Choice of location near to work place or away from workplace is required to have its place in BDP 2031, these flexibilities will reduce the growth of illegal colonies and unplanned urban sprawl. In either case, public transport is the prime concern to be integrated with residential areas. The already vacant houses also need to be reviewed in terms of accessibility to public transport and infrastructure provisions,” states the draft Bhopal master plan 2031.

The new proposal would be a tight walk as similar measures have been struck down by court. Under the new proposal to be tabled in Vidhan Sabha , illegal encroachments or development on government land would not be covered.

After the introduction of Bhopal master plan 2031 this week, a detailed zonal plan is expected. It would provide legal impetus to the measure. Municipal Corporation Act , 1956, or M P Municipality Act, 1961, has no provision for regularization of illegal colonies.

Earlier too, urban development department has mooted plans to legalise colonies by charging 20% development charges for repairing sewage line and road and water supply.

Last year, Madhya Pradesh, the Gwalior bench of MP High Court struck down the decision of previous BJP government led by Shivraj Singh Chouhan to legalise about 4,000 colonies. MPHC bench declared rule 15A framed by the state government for regularization of illegal colonies as ‘ultra vires’ (done beyond its legal power).

Pune: The civic body claims to have completed the target of converting 25% public toilets into ‘best toilets’, in order to regain its lost position in the nation-wide annual sanitation competition, Swachh Sarvekshan .

The move, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials said, would help the civic body in improving the city’s ranking in Swachh Sarvekshan. The city had dropped to a worrisome 37th position last year.

A total of 63 parameters was defined by the Union government to declare a public toilet ‘best’. The set parameters stated that for better ranking, any city would need to have at least 25% ‘best toilets’. Based on the number of public toilets in the city, the civic body had to convert 310 out of 1,124 public toilets into such facilities.

“The 310 toilets were revamped to meet the parameters set by the Centre. Facilities such as sanitary napkin dispenser and incinerators have been provided in these toilets. Other mandatory facilities including basins, urinals and disabled friendly sanitation facilities, have also been provided,” a PMC official said.

“These units are located across the city. Besides the key locations, such toilets can also be seen in some of the remote areas. The head office of PMC’s solid waste management and ward offices have jointly built these facilities. The civic body has spent nearly Rs10.5 crore on the initiative. Each new toilet has cost us nearly Rs3.5 lakh.” the official added.

“The city could not get ODF+ revalidation around six months ago. So, the PMC decided to improve the public sanitation facility and applied for higher certification, that is ODF++,” head of PMC’s solid waste management department Dnyaneshwar Molak said.

He said a third party inspection committee visited the toilets. “They inspected 49 facilities across the city, following which ODF++ certification was awarded. It has paved the way to fight for the position of the cleanest city in the country,” Molak added.

220,['9/03/2020'],Disposal bags must with sanitary napkins from next Jan: Javadekar,"PUNE: All the sanitary napkin manufactures will have to provide disposal bags. The Union government has planned such a policy, Union minister of environment Prakash Javadekar said on Sunday.

He was speaking at a programme organised by SWaCH, a waste management collective, in Pune. “From January 2021, sanitary pad manufacturers will have to provide packets for disposal of each pad,” he said. Mayor Murlidhar Mohol was also present for the programme.

Production and usage of sanitary napkins and diapers have increased but they are still being discarded in a way which is harmful to waste pickers, the minister said.

“We will implement the rule that from January 2021 all sanitary pad manufacturers will have to give degradable bags for disposal of each sanitary napkin. This rule is already in existence, but is not being followed by the manufacturers,” he said.

Javadekar said a decentralized model was needed wherein garbage by educational institutes and housing societies should be disposed of on the premises itself.

“The rule for compulsory picking of garbage and disposal for municipal towns will be made compulsory for all the habitations with more than 3,000 population,” he added.

He said he will fund the construction of 50 big and 50 small garbage sheds designed by SWaCH. It will be given from his MP local area development funds.

SWaCH founder Laxmi Narayan said money spent on transport of garbage should be utilized in encouraging people to make garbage into compost at the source. “Pune needs a facility that buys plastic waste which will be an incentive for waste pickers and segregation,” she said.

Rani Shivsaran, a SWaCH member, said a permanent shed for sorting of garbage at each ward was necessary. Initiatives like V-Collect help pick up items lying unused from homes and prove additional source of income.

The civic body has been taking a slew of measures for efficient waste management in the city. Citizens willing to process wet garbage generated at home can seek funds from the Pune Municipal Corporation .

The civic body will partly fund the two-bucket vermi compost units for citizens. The units can be set up in independent houses and residential flats. Based on the size, a unit can cost between Rs 4,000 and Rs 10,000. The initiative has been taken to promote segregation and disposal of garbage at source.

221,['9/03/2020'],"Delhi: In times of coronavirus, commuters and drivers wary of each other","While commuters see cabs as a safer option, they are not sure whether they are also totally safe (Photo: ANI)

NEW DELHI: Ritesh Sharma regularly takes the cab to work. But in the midst of the novel coronavirus scare, the Vasant Kunj resident has started wearing a mask for his trips to central Delhi and back. “New cases are being detected every day. While I find app-based cabs a safer travel option than public transport, I’m still apprehensive. These cabs ferry a large number of passengers through the day and I’m worried whether the drivers keep the vehicles sanitised,” Sharma said. “I hope wearing a mask helps, but there is still the problem of touching surfaces like door handles and locks,” he said.

Suchismita Das, a Malviya Nagar resident, says she has had to forgo the cheaper alternative of shared rides. “For now, I have stopped taking shared rides. As you can’t completely avoid touching common surfaces, I vigorously clean my hands with a sanitiser as soon as I get down,” she said.

Drivers, too, are a wary lot, especially of passengers who might have travelled abroad recently. “Drivers working on both Ola and Uber platforms pick up and drop a large number of passengers at Delhi airport,” said Deepak Saraswat, general secretary of Sarvodaya Driver Association of Delhi. “How will a driver know if the passenger is coming back from a trip to a country like Italy, Thailand or Malaysia?” Sanjay Samrat, president of Delhi Taxi, Tourist Transporters and Tour Operators Association, met Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Saturday to request stringent health checks at Delhi airport to ensure that no traveller infected by novel coronavirus uses tourist cabs or buses.

Cab aggregators Ola and Uber said they were taking necessary measures and also sensitising their driver-partners about precautions. “Our walk-in centres across cities have been equipped with a steady supply of health advisory material, sanitisers and masks, which can be picked up and used by the driver-partners to ensure the highest levels of cleanliness for themselves and their vehicles. This will help create a safer and cleaner ride experience for our customers as well,” Ola said in a statement. The company said that it was reiterating the importance of personal hygiene through a dedicated preparedness module for driver-partners to create awareness.

“We urge customers to join us in this initiative by adhering to health guidelines including personal hygiene and seeking immediate medical attention if they have flu-like symptoms. This will go a long way in ensuring their well-being as well as that of fellow passengers and driver-partners,” it added.

An Uber spokesperson said: “We are always working to help ensure the safety of our employees and everyone on the Uber platform, and we continue to be concerned by the ongoing spread of coronavirus. We have formed a dedicated team of Uber operations, security and safety executives, guided by the advice of a consulting public health expert, to respond as needed in each market where we operate in South Asia. We remain in constant contact with local public health authorities and will continue to follow their advice. We have also communicated their recommendations to our drivers.”

Saraswat, however, claimed that even if the drivers were apprehensive of picking up a passenger, they couldn’t expect any help from the companies. “Not only would the driver have to pay a cancellation charge, but he would also be ‘offloaded’ from the aggregator platform. It takes three to four days for drivers to get themselves back into the system in such cases,” he said.

But Uber insisted that if driver-partners felt uncomfortable about picking up a passenger for safety reasons, they could choose not to accept or cancel the trip. However, they can’t discriminate against anyone based on their race or nationality. Ola said that its Partner Care teams and Safety Response teams were available 24x7 for any concerns that might arise for driver-partners and customers respectively. “We encourage everyone to proactively report any instance that may be symptomatic for us to help action and guide appropriately,” the company said.

Kamaljeet Gill, president of Sarvodaya Driver Association of Delhi, said: “When it comes to the coronavirus scare, drivers are at the forefront as we have to pick up passengers from hospitals and airports and you don’t know who could be infected. Our association has distributed hand sanitisers and masks to drivers and also asked them to keep their cabs clean.”

The smugglers who realised there was movement of task force personnel, tried to abscond. But the task force team chased their vehicle and upon inspecting the vehicle, seized 17 red sanders logs and the vehicle used for the smuggling activity.

Two smugglers identified as Yezhumalai (35) and Shankar (51) were arrested by the task force sleuths.

223,['9/03/2020'],"Ladies, finding it hard to commute? Rosto Ride Share will steer the way","Panaji: For women commuters, this will certainly be a game changer.

While the concept of carpooling is popular in other countries, the idea is catching up in India only in recent times, albeit in the metros. For Goan women, especially those without a car, daily commute and navigation through traffic can now come at a low cost, or even free of cost, through the Rosto Ride Share.

Through this initiative, women in Goa can text on the number 9922411239 on WhatsApp to avail of a ride to their desired destination within the state.

The initiative was launched on Women’s Day at Porvorim-based Sensible Earth, a centre that promotes sustainable living. “Mobility is one of the biggest challenges that disempowers women in Goa. It is either not safe, unreliable or too expensive, and we feel that women need the freedom to move around freely,” said Sanjiv Khandelwal, co-founder of Sensible Earth.

The technology, however, doesn’t support tracking the vehicle’s movement much like app-based aggregators Ola and Uber in other states do. “From a safety point of view, however, we are getting everyone’s proof of identity and contact information before they’re added to the group. Therefore, there is a fair amount of security from that point built in,” Khandelwal said.

The idea of Rosto Ride Share germinated as an offshoot of activist Cecille Rodrigues’ #RostoGoa campaign wherein she first highlighted potholes in a dance-video that went viral, and then painted stripes on speed breakers to make them conspicuous, and the roads, safer. “It’s very important to have less traffic on the road. We must therefore take up the initiative of carpooling or bike-pooling for sustainable living,” Rodrigues said, adding that women can avail of this service not only to go to work but also if they require to attend events or parties that may end late.

“Through this initiative, we’re also trying to help out senior citizens and women who finish their work late and wait for buses. The public transportation system in Goa is in a very bad situation, so we as women drivers can stop by and ask other women if they require a ride through this platform,” she added.

As the initiative gathers momentum and gains popularity, Rodrigues intends to expand this service by starting an app for pick-up and drop services for women.

PUNE: An autorickshaw driver picked up an abandoned bag, containing gold jewellery worth Rs7.57 lakh, from a prepaid booth near the railway station on Sunday morning, took it to the GRP station and tracked down the owner with the help of the police.

Railway passenger Deepak Pandurang Chitrala, a resident of Hadapsar, arrived at the Pune railway station early on Sunday morning and went to the prepaid booth to book an autorickshaw, said an officer of the Government Railway Police (GRP).

He kept the bag on the floor while booking the autorickshaw but forgot and absent-mindedly left it in the booth, a police officer said.

Autorickshaw driver Bharat Kisan Bhosale saw the bag and took it to the police station. The police found gold ornaments in the bag.

The police then checked the bag for some clues to track down its owner, said inspector Sureshsingh Gaud of GRP.

On realizing that the bag belonged to a man from Hadapsar, a police team headed towards Hadapsar. In meantime, another team found Chitrala roaming the area in search of his bag.

The police team verified his identity, had Chitrala check all the ornaments and then handed the bag to him, a police officer said.

JAIPUR: The Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS) has asked the state government to clarify its position on National Population Register (NPR) which is starting from April. MKSS was celebrating International Women’s Day at Shaheed Smarak which has become the epicentre of anti-CAA protests in Rajasthan. Activist Aruna Roy, while addressing the women here, said that NPR is linked with NRC and states should vehemently oppose it.

“The government should clarify as to what efforts it is making to stop the NPR exercise in the state,” said Roy. Echoing her concern, Nikhil Dey asked the state to take strong action against NPR just like it has taken against CAA . Roy called the movement that has been running from the past one month as historic and unprecedented.

“The movement is being collectively led by brave women. It has restored people’s faith in democracy and till the aim is achieved it should continue,” said Roy, who has been frequenting the protest site which is mainly run by Muslim women. She said that this movement filled women with confidence.

Anam Hussain, a second-year student who has been visiting the protest site regularly said that this International Women’s Day is the most memorable one. “My parents were very protective and had never allowed me to participate in any voluntary activity until the start of anti-CAA protest. Even I was not aware that my oratory skills are highly convincing,” said Hussain.

Several other women groups celebrated programmes at the protest site. Most of the protesters here got to know for the first time that March 8 is observed as Women’s Day.Meanwhile, members of at least 20 ‘Save the Constitution’ bodies which are holding anti-CAA protest called for a meeting at Muslim Musafirkhana to discuss the future course of action. The meeting was held to bring all the movements on a common platform.

BHOPAL: Another of the ‘missing’ MLAs, Congress veteran Bisahulal Singh, returned to Bhopal on Sunday, suggesting that the weeklong political storm over alleged horse-trading’ may be on the wane. On Saturday, Independent MLA Surendra Singh Shera had come back to the fold.

Bisahulal Singh, four-time MLA from Annuppur, flew from Bengaluru to Indore, escorted by tourism minister Surendra Singh Baghel on Sunday afternoon. At Indore, he was greeted by home minister Bala Bachchan and brought to Bhopal in a state aircraft.

After a lengthy meeting with chief minister Kamal Nath at his residence in the evening, Singh told mediapersons that he was with the Nath government.

Coming out of CM House with finance minister Tarun Bhanot , Singh said “I was on a pilgrimage. I was moving around, visiting places of worship. I have no grouse against the Kamal Nath government. I am with the government.”

Asked if he was promised a ministerial berth by the CM or he had asked for it, Singh said: “It is for the chief minister to decide.” The 70-year-old Congress veteran denied that he was taken forcibly to Bengaluru by BJP leaders, or that he was kept captive by BJP.

Singh’s nephew, who lives in Bhopal, had filed an FIR at TT Nagar police station, fearing the elderly MLA had been abducted.

With Singh back, there are two more Congress MLAs ‘missing’ -- Hardeep Singh Dang, who had sent his resignation on March 6, and Raghuraj Singh Kansana.

There was a buzz in Congress circles since Shera’s return on Saturday that at least one Congress MLA would be back within 24 hours. On Sunday morning, Congress tweeted pictures of the tourism minister sitting with Singh at Bengaluru airport.

Congress media coordinator Narendra Saluja, tweeted pictures of Singh with Baghel and wrote: “Woh teen din se BJP ke changul mein phanse the (he was in BJP’s grip for three days).”

On March 5, when higher education minister Jitu Patwari had returned to Bhopal with three MLAs – BSP’s Ram Bai and Sanjeev Kushwah and SP’s Rajesh Kumar Shukla -- senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh had said that four other MLAs, who were in Manesar, had been “taken to Bengaluru by BJP leaders” and that Bisahulal Singh was “bodily lifted and taken against his will”.

However, just like the other MLAs who have returned, Bisahulal Singh also denied that he was taken by BJP or held against his wishes. Dang and Kansana are apparently lodged at a hotel in Bengaluru. Congress sources say the party has established contact with them.

PUNE: An unidentified man stole Rs9.71 lakh by opening the cash-dispensing unit of an ATM in using a duplicate key. The incident occurred in Talegaon Dabhade on February 22, while the bank’s branch manager lodged an FIR with the police on Saturday.

“The bank officials approached the police almost after gap of 14 days with their complaint because the theft did not come to light immediately. A study of the bank server log revealed that there was some misappropriation of cash from the ATM unit,” police inspector Shahji Pawar of Talegaon Dabhade police said, explaining the delay in filing the complaint.

“Further, the machine was not damaged and there were no signs of any online tampering with the machine. So, the theft remained under the bank’s radar,” he said.

“However, there were fewer withdrawals and more deposits in the ATM unit, and the bank’s server highlighted the issue,” he explained.

Following this, the bank officials studied the CCTV footage of the ATM kiosk and saw the man stealing the cash without damaging the machine. “The footage further revealed that the man used a key to open the cash tray and also keyed in the correct password of the machine to open its screen and disengage it from the server for a few minutes,” Pawar said.

The unsuspecting bank officials continued to deposit cash in the ATM unit for the past 14 days, he said.

“The ATM unit has two safe keys — both are in the possession of the bank officials. These two keys were not removed by anyone from the bank premises,” he said.

“Prima facie, it is suspected that unidentified man, who is seen in the CCTV footage, prepared a duplicate of the ATM unit’s keys and also knows the password of the machine. We will also investigate the possibility of an insider hand in the theft, as the ATM unit’s password is known to only some officers and cash depositing officials,” he said.

While the bodies of Vasantha Kumari and Sudesh were found in the kitchen and living room of the house, respectively, Sudarshanan’s body was found in an adjoining extended room.

As per an agreement after police intervened, Sudarshanan was allowed to stay in the extended portion of the house. When he fought with his wife, the son would oppose him, and it would come to blows. The persisting quarrels may have led to the deaths, police said.

The parking area was almost full to capacity with guests for the wedding. The sudden fire set people rushing to retrieve their vehicles from and take them to a safer place, Dhumal said.

Eyewitnesses told the police that the firecrackers started soon after the marriage was solemnized. “We are also investigating another theory by some other witnesses who said the fire may have been caused by a short circuit in a vehicle,” he added.

230,['9/03/2020'],Clarify stand on NPR: MKSS to Rajasthan government,"Representative image

JAIPUR: The Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS) has asked the state government to clarify its position on National Population Register (NPR) which is starting from April. MKSS was celebrating International Women’s Day at Shaheed Smarak which has become the epicentre of anti-CAA protests in Rajasthan. Activist Aruna Roy, while addressing the women here, said that NPR is linked with NRC and states should vehemently oppose it.

“The government should clarify as to what efforts it is making to stop the NPR exercise in the state,” said Roy. Echoing her concern, Nikhil Dey asked the state to take strong action against NPR just like it has taken against CAA . Roy called the movement that has been running from the past one month as historic and unprecedented.

“The movement is being collectively led by brave women. It has restored people’s faith in democracy and till the aim is achieved it should continue,” said Roy, who has been frequenting the protest site which is mainly run by Muslim women. She said that this movement filled women with confidence.

Anam Hussain, a second-year student who has been visiting the protest site regularly said that this International Women’s Day is the most memorable one. “My parents were very protective and had never allowed me to participate in any voluntary activity until the start of anti-CAA protest. Even I was not aware that my oratory skills are highly convincing,” said Hussain.

Several other women groups celebrated programmes at the protest site. Most of the protesters here got to know for the first time that March 8 is observed as Women’s Day.Meanwhile, members of at least 20 ‘Save the Constitution’ bodies which are holding anti-CAA protest called for a meeting at Muslim Musafirkhana to discuss the future course of action. The meeting was held to bring all the movements on a common platform.

A massive violence had erupted in Muzaffarnagar on December 20 last year during protest against the CAA, in which minor were spotted among the protesters.

The team, led by Uttar Pradesh State Commission for Protection of Child Rights chairman Vishesh Gupta and member Jaya Singh, on Saturday visited the affected areas—Minakshi Chowk, Sadat Hostel, Kachchi Sadak— where large scale violence erupted and recorded the statements of some people.

Speaking to reporters, Gupta said, “We are here to conduct a probe about the role of minors in the December 20 violence and to find out whether the kids were forced to participate in the protest or not. This is only the first stage; we will inquire from every possible angle. After finishing with our investigation we will submit our report to State Commission for Protection of Child Rights.”

It should be noted that after a month of the violence, a Special Investigation Team (SIT), probing the cases of violence during the anti-CAA protests, had booked 33 jailed protesters for allegedly provoking children to throw stones at policemen during the clashes.

The probe agency had also invoked sections of Juvenile Justice (Care snd Protection of Children) Act, 2015, against the accused. All the 33 accused were earlier charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and sent to jail.

Among the charges faced by the 33 protesters under the Juvenile Justice Act include— use of children by militant groups, sale and procurement of children for any purpose, including illegal adoption, and offences against disabled children.

The SIT had got the permission to slap the additional charge on the 33 accused from court.

According to police, nearly 50 cases were registered at Nagar Kotwali and Civil Lines police stations, in which more than 250 people named and thousands of unnamed were booked. Police have arrested more than 90 people so far in the matter.

NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to make separate arrangements at its dispensaries, maternity homes and hospitals for people affected with cold, cough and other respiratory issues so that they don’t come in contact with other patients.

“There are 112 dispensaries, maternity homes and hospitals under our jurisdiction. It was decided at a meeting chaired by the commissioner that people afflicted with even common cold and cough will be directed to OPDs from the entrance only. This will help avoid their movement in the main complex,” a senior SDMC official said.

The civic agencies, which have created isolation wards in the medical centres for suspected Covid-19 patients, have started distributing masks to doctors and other staff.

Through an official circular, the health department of EDMC has advised setting up of separate OPD counters at Swami Dayanand and Veer Savarkar hospitals for flu-affected patients. North corporation, too, has also marked a 14-bed ward in Hindu Rao Hospital for suspected novel coronavirus patients besides distributing 3,000 N-95 masks and deputing a nodal officer.

The agencies are taking precautions to avoid crowds at citizen bureau centres and property tax offices. “We may arrange for more counters to avoid queues at citizen bureau centres, considering that March 31 is the last date for submitting house tax,” the official added.

Senior EDMC officials have also been asked to conduct meetings with resident welfare associations and traders’ association, requesting them to avoid social gatherings for Holi.

MEERUT: Police in UP’s Bulandshahr on Sunday booked its four men for allegedly abducting people with criminal background and extorting money from their families by threatening encounter. Three head constables and a constable posted with Bulandshahr police were booked on the basis of a complaint filed by a lawyer.

The four policemen were identified as head constables Sanjeev Malik, Yograj Singh, Zaikr Hussain and constable Dheeraj Kumar, all posted at Sikandarabad police station in Bulandshahr. All four have been suspended pending investigation, for which a SIT has been constituted.

According to SSP Bulandshahr, Santosh Kumar , “There is evidence of the four policemen’s involvement in abduction of people, especially from tribal and nomadic groups. After the abduction, they used to extort money from their families by threating to slap criminal charges. They also used to threaten encounter.”

“After inputs, a departmental probe was launched. During the initial probe, most of the claims were corroborated. It hinted at organised gang behind abduction and extortion from people of tribal groups with criminal background,” SSP Santosh Kumar said.

Investigating officers claimed that it may be the tip of the iceberg and several other policemen from neighbouring districts could be part of the larger nexus.

“Using police input on criminals, they would abduct the victim and use his phone to intimidate family by threatening them of police encounter or slapping of criminal charges against the abducted victim,” the SSP said.

An FIR under IPC section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 343 (wrongful confinement for three or more days) and 386 (extortion) and relevant sections of prevention of corruption act was lodged at Sikandrabad police station. An SIT under IPS officer Gopal Chaudhary and ASP Bulandshahr was constituted to probe the case.

“It is highly unlikely that we get witness in the case. So we will have to back our claim with technical evidences by digging up call records, tower locations, electronic money trail if any to establish the link between the victims and accused policemen,” the SSP said.

BHOPAL: An uninvited guest created ruckus at a dream marriage reception at a prominent hotel along Van Vihar road on Bhopal outskirts on March 6 leaving the groom’s brother injured, much to the dismay of guests that included some from Europe. The wild boar unleashed terror among the guests and the family has now lodged a complaint with the local police and sought action against the hotel management for negligence.

More than 29 guests including some international guests were present as the girl was getting married to an Austrian groom.

Police said marriage of Monika Bhade, a resident of Betul in Madhya Pradesh took place at the hotel with a groom from Austria, Europe on March 4.

Father of Monika, Devendra Bhade, 54, who works with Western Coalfields Limited (WCL) in Pathakheda, Betul said, “There were 29 guests including some from Europe and other countries who stayed at the hotel. On March 6, we had to drop our guests to airport as they had to catch a flight. At around 5.48 am, a wild boar entered the premises and approached us while we were at the porch to see off the guests. My son Mayur, 30, did all he could to ensure guests are safe. He locked some of them in the washroom and some at other places, but unfortunately the animal injured him in his thighs. We tried for primary aid, but it was not available at the hotel and the staff were also not supportive.”

“We then dropped the guests and rushed him to a hospital. Doctors claim that the injury is grievous, and it would take time before he could be discharged,” he said.

“We stayed at the hotel and it was the responsibility of the hotel to ensure our safety. I want police to act against the hotel, but the response of police too has been cold, so far. I do not want that anyone who stays at the hotel in future to face the same problems that we did,” he said.

When contacted, assistant manager, front desk of the hotel, Pranay Soni told TOI, “We have proper security at our premises. The said incident took place between 5.45 am and 6 am and the animal sneaked in as the main gate was opened to facilitate entry of some staff. Our guard tried to stop it, but he was injured. The second guard tried his best to stop the animal.”

“We immediately informed the Van Vihar (local zoo) and forest staff rescued the animal after a seven hour mission,” he said.

244,['9/03/2020'],Wronging a right: Age-old trees that were de-choked choked again,"Nagpur: In a move that defies logic, the age-old trees that were de-choked some years back have been choked again with cement at Katol Road. Afraid that the trees might die, infuriated greens have demanded immediate action.

The issue was brought to notice by C Vijay Nayudu, president of Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) contractors welfare association. The trees were de-choked under Nayudu’s supervision some years back.

While passing through Katol Road a few days back, Nayudu was shocked to find the same trees choked completely. According to him, the trees were choked by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) while laying interlocking tiles on the pavements. TOI could not contact the NHAI official concerned for confirmation.

At first, Nayudu spotted labourers filling the gap between tiles and base of two trees with cement. “When I stopped to check, I was shocked to find that many trees on the pavement were brutally choked. First of all, there was no mandatory space left between the tiles and tree base. On top of that, the little space left was filled with cement,” he told TOI.

Environment activists demanded immediate de-choking of the trees. Founder of NGO Green Vigil Kaustav Chatterjee, who inspected the spot on Sunday, found more trees choked in a similar manner. “It is completely senseless to choke the already de-choked trees. NMC must take strict action,” he said.

NMC garden superintendent Amol Chorpagar assured to take action on Monday. “Our officials will carry out a spot inspection and take immediate measures to save the trees,” he said.

In February last year, NMC chief engineer Ulhas Debadwar had issued orders to remove interlocking tiles for de-choking trees. In May last year, the civic body had launched a massive drive to de-choke around 9,419 fully-grown trees spread over 382 kilometres road length. Taking serious note of the fact that many age-old trees in the city were on the verge of keeling, the initiative was taken by the then municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar.

Highlighting that the city needs more such drives, Chatterjee suggested that zone-wise de-choking should be carried out. “While NMC has de-choked many trees on major roads, it should now focus on saving trees on internal roads. Zone-wise survey should be done to identify choked trees,” he said.

The activist added that de-choking should be done before rainy season. “Only then, the water would be able to percolate in the roots,” he said.

The Panaji residency, which overlooks the Mandovi, was renovated more than three years ago.The average occupancy at its residencies between April and August 2018, was not even 50 %.Though most of GTDC’s properties are situated at prime locations, and some are sea-facing, they are mostly old, poorly-maintained and badly-operated, barring a few.An official said while properties are old, the service is also not on par with similarly placed properties operated by private players.“The residencies are in beautiful locations and close to the beach, and yet, they are not as profitable as other hotels. Firstly, because the service offered is not good. Also, they are not making a profit as the operating costs remain high, due to the salary component,” the official said.Standard room tariff, he said, at GTDC residencies , is above Rs 1,000 and the tariff for an air-conditioned room is over Rs 2,000.“When the staff is sluggish and guests do not get services they expect, there is no way occupancy will be impressive,” he said.He said the Mapusa residency, despite being centrally-located, close to the bus stand and the famous Mapusa market, and only a few kilometres away from the bustling coastal belt of Calangute and Candolim, it does not enjoy 100% occupancy. “It is an old property, and gives out vibes that it is a shady hotel. I don’t think the property will earn even average business,” he said.“Blaming it on fewer tourist footfalls or heavy rainfall will not help increase occupancy— GTDC will have to look at innovative ways to improve the quality of their residencies,” he added.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74544779,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-549752,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gtdc-residencies-see-rs-1-8cr-drop-in-revenue-for-2018-19/articleshow/74543298.cms

He belonged to Shivpora locality in Srinagar and was living with his wife in C block, Jamia Nagar , in Okhla Vihar area, they added.Hina was allegedly masquerading as “Katijah al Kashmiri and Hannabee” on pro-IS chat and media platforms while scouting for vulnerable youths. “They are members of banned terrorist outfit ISIS and propagating its ideology of hatred against non-Muslims and, thereby, also inciting Muslims to kill non-Muslims. They are also inciting Muslims to take up violent struggle against the state. They are inciting Muslims against CAA too,” Pramod Kushwaha, DCP (Special Cell), claimed.Four mobile phones, a laptop, an external hard disk and other incriminating material were allegedly seized from the couple’s house.During investigation, the cops claimed to have found that the couple created several anonymous IDs on social media platforms, such as Telegram, Facebook, Threema, Sure Spot, Instagram and Twitter, to propagate IS ideology.They have been booked under IPC sections of sedition, promoting hatred between two groups and criminal conspiracy apart from sections 13 and 20 of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

The couple was earlier handled by Abdullah Basith, a Hyderabad-based operative arrested by NIA for running an IS module, they added. They knew him as Khattab.Tipped off by an intelligence agency, the cell had been tracking the couple for two months and kept a close watch on their online activities, which allegedly gathered pace in February. The cops began to close in after they allegedly started circulating the IS digital magazine, Sawt al Hind (Voice of Hind).“The couple was trying to recruit youths into IS-India province (Wilayah-al-Hind) using social media platforms and was in touch with several senior members of Islamic State in Khorasan province ( ISKP ) in Afghanistan and Syria through chat platforms,” said an official.“The couple was allegedly trying to brainwash youths into carrying out suicide attacks in the country.

247,['9/03/2020'],"Bane for China, corona turns out to be a boon for desi pichkari makers","People selecting pichkari at shop in Patna on Friday ahead of Holi festival.Pic by-Pramod Sharma

Nagpur: Corona virus impact has brought an opportunity for Indian manufacturers this Holi season. As the virus outbreak has hampered trade from China, even imports of pichkaris (water gun) and other items sold during Holi have been hit. This has given a chance to Indian manufacturers to take over the market that was traditionally dominated by Chinese players.

However, traders down the chain are apprehensive that the scare and calls to tone down celebrations by the government agencies may hit their business for the coming two days.

The market that was dominated by Chinese products since nearly last ten years has been largely replaced by Indian items this festive season, say local traders. “This did not happen overnight, but certainly coronavirus was a major reason,” said bulk dealers here.

“The process began three years ago and finally as the imports have taken a hit due to the outbreak, nearly 90% of the market has made in India goods,” said Ashok Sanghvi of M/s Modern Rakhi Bhandar, a bulk trading firm in seasonal festive items at Itwari. “The Indian players have managed to meet the rate and the quality of the Chinese manufacturers,” he said.

Sanghvi said, “Even before the corona outbreak, the traders here were facing hassles in procuring Chinese items due to procedural issues from the Customs’ side. Three years ago, the traders approached toy manufacturers in Delhi to take up the production of Holi items too. The units began procuring dyes to make the goods. Till last Holi, as much as 70% of the supply was Indian and now it is 90%.” Colours continue to come from Hathras town in Uttar Pradesh, which is the major hub, he said.

Retail traders, on the other hand, said the stockists having Chinese items are trying to take advantage of the situation and have jacked the prices. The corona scare is barely two months old the but the stocks are piled up even before that. “Given the sentiment, the local stockists have hiked the rates by 20% to 40%,” said retailers.

“Sales are not down despite the strictures related to safety measures. However, the Chinese items are not available as much as they were last year. In general, the rates have gone up by 40%,” said Kishore Jaikalyani of M/s Kishore General Stores in Gokulpeth.

A little away at M/s Pankaj Stores, the shopkeeper said the sales are nearly half of the last year. “We used to get creative designs of water guns from China apart from masks and wigs. Such items are in short supply. We have simple pichkaris from Indian suppliers. The rates of both the items are up but sales are down,” he said.

The balloons used for filling water come from China. “As against 50 a packet, it is being sold at Rs80 by the wholesalers this season,” added a shopkeeper nearby.

248,['9/03/2020'],VNSGU a distant 16th in state universities ranking,"cap

Surat: Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU), one of the oldest universities that covers largest area dominated by tribal communities in the state, stands at a poor 16th rank among the universities by Gujarat State Institutional Rating Framework (GSIRF). Knowledge Consortium of Gujarat (KCG) views it as a pioneering attempt towards creating world class institutions in the state.

Over 2.5 lakh students study in various departments and colleges of the university, with their number increasing with each passing year. But the ranking has proved that the university has poor infrastructure compared to some newly developed universities.

Former top academicians of the university said that situation was getting worse as far as higher education was concerned in VNSGU. ""Senior professors and students often share their pain with me. Academic level is going down and due to political interference even senior teachers can’t do anything,"" former vice-chancellor of VNSGU, B A Parikh told TOI. Parikh was VNSGU VC from 1991 to 1997.

""I am told that the situation has become worse of late. In this condition the rank will drop obviously,"" Parikh added.

Retired professor and former leader of university teachers, Suryakant Shah, explained, ""The VC's appointment and his credentials are under doubt. How can a university perform better? There are several vacant posts of teachers and top officials are busy politicking. Despite being ranked poorly, this university will now be judging a few of its affiliated colleges that have been ranked better."" Universities were judged on various criteria like teaching, learning and resources, research and professional practice, graduation outcome, outreach and inclusivity. A university is supposed to file various details on the basis of which the ratings are given.

""Heart of any educational institute is its teachers. In VNSGU, the current top officials targeted teachers for one or the other reason. Research has also suffered heavily and the ranking shows the actual condition of the university,"" said Sanjay Desai, a syndicate member, VNSGU.

Ketan Desai, a syndicate member, said, ""I can't comment on the current situation since I am not aware under which all criteria the university has performed poorly. I need to check how the applications were filed and many good colleges have got poor ranks too.”

VNSGU VC Shivendra Gupta and registrar Rajendra Patel were not available for comments.

249,['9/03/2020'],"Expanding Trichy means growth in every sector, say experts","Trichy: Trichy City Corporation was last expanded in 2011 by adding Thiruverumbur to the civic body’s jurisdiction, but after that nothing has happened on the corporation’s expansion front. As the civic body holds only a limited land parcel, urban developers have opined that adding new area will pave way for infrastructure development and revenue generation as it will attract private investors on the city’s land availability, human resource and augmented consumer population.

Despite having the geographical advantage of being located at the centre of the state and better connectivity to all cities, the growth of the city in the past decade has been underwhelming. To overcome this, city development enthusiasts suggested bringing the urbanised municipalities, town panchayats and village panchayats to the corporation’s fold. Since the development schemes from the central government are based on a city’s population, expanding the city by adding the urbanised suburbs will help the local body avail more funds. People had suggested to include Thuvakudi in the east, Manachanallur, Number One tollgate in the north, Nachikurichi in the west and Olaiyur, Gundoor in the south to the corporation. ""Expansion will really help Trichy develop as it will open many investment opportunities. More players in the service sector will grab opportunities, which is needed for industrial growth,"" A Shankar, COO, Strategic Consulting, JLL India, said.

Apart from increasing revenue, the expansion will result in the corporation getting more land parcels for infrastructure development. Except for Panchapur, at present the civic body has very minimal land parcels. With a rise in population across the suburbs, residents of Vasan Nagar and Anna Nagar near OFT expressed their desire to be a part of the corporation.

""Madurai and Coimbatore Corporations have 100 wards each, but Trichy with 65 wards is in disadvantage as bigger cities get priority in welfare schemes. Present urban agglomeration should be included in Trichy city as expanding the city is vital,"" N Manivannan, member, Trichy Intra-City Development Endeavours (TIDES), said.

However, there is a hesitation from the residents as Thiruverumbur, which was added to the city in 2011, still awaits basic amenities. Though there was a proposal in 2016-17 to expand the corporation’s jurisdiction, nothing has happened on it. ""The decision to expand the civic body has to be taken by the state government in consultation with the elected council. Adding industrial area such as Thuvakudi may benefit the civic body,"" a corporation official said.

250,['9/03/2020'],Delhi Violence: Agencies probe role of ‘external force’ in Delhi riots,"A day after of North-East Delhi riot situation of Shiv Vihar.As residents remain in houses.

NEW DELHI: The home ministry ’s official version that the Delhi violence was “spontaneous” and MoS (Home) G Kishan Reddy’s statement that riots were orchestrated to defame India during US President Donald Trump’s visit may not be as contradictory as they might seem, according to law enforcement agencies probing the sequence of events.

While there were ongoing sit-in protests in northeast Delhi prior to February 22, a communal clash did not seem imminent until a trigger was provided during the intervening night of February 22-23 by an “external force” that, police sources allege, prevailed on the anti-CAA women agitators to escalate the protest to a full-fledged roadblock by relocating to the arterial Jafrabad Metro station road.

Police sources said this “external force” could be women’s rights group Pinjra Tod, formed in 2015 largely by Delhi University women students to protest restrictions enforced on female students in Jamia University. An officer claimed Pinjra Tod activists were present in the Seelampur-Jafrabad area on February 22 evening and urged the anti-CAA protesters at the dharna site and other nearby areas to make their anti-CAA protest more impactful by creating a roadblock at the Jafrabad Metro station road.

The blockade, which soon led to blocking of the feeder roads as well, is seen to have provoked a counter show of strength, triggering Hindu-Muslim clashes. The skirmishes, which until the evening of February 23 were limited to stone-pelting from both sides and a few incidents of arson, turned into a full-blown communal riot by February 24 afternoon when Trump was in Ahmedabad.

“Looking at the sequence of events, the assessment is that had the sit-ins continued as before in northeast Delhi and the Jafrabad Metro station roadblock not created, clashes that spiralled into communal riots may not have followed. In that respect, the violence was ‘spontaneous’,” said an officer.

A Pinjra Tod member, however, denied that the organisation had prevailed upon women anti-CAA protestors to shift to Jafrabad Metro station site to block the road. “They did so out of their own volition. We are shocked how this narrative blaming us is being spread by some people, and how this has got so much traction,” the member said.

A police officer said investigations so far do not point to “outsiders” or “stones and bricks” being brought in from neighbouring states, with a view to engineer riots. Given the information about the alleged role of Pinjra Tod activists, officials are probing why a group that had so far confined itself to fighting for rights of women students, got involved in the anti-CAA stir and to what extent.

“The assessment is that there may have been two reasons behind getting the anti-CAA women protesters to shift from the small Jafrabad dharna to an arterial road. One, an attempt to create an alternative protest site in apprehension of the Supreme Court moving to end the dharna at Shaheen Bagh, and second, to create a negative image of India coinciding with the US President’s visit,” said a source.

Investigators said Pinjra Tod activists were at the dharna site not merely in solidarity with women protestors but were also actively involved in scaling up the protest. “Even if Pinjra Tod is given the benefit of doubt in that it could not have anticipated the likely consequences, they jumped into an already tense situation when Bhim Army had given an anti-CAA bandh call the following day. This action might amount to instigation and will be probed,” said an officer.

The Pinjra Tod member said, “It’s unbelievable how we, with the little resources we have, can engineer something like this (riots). Yes, we support the anti-CAA protests and our members, who are politically active, were visiting the protests sites to express solidarity with the Muslim women.” She, however, followed this up by saying a few Pinjra Tod activists who joined women protestors as they moved to Jafrabad road, were acting in “their personal capacity”.

When asked if and when Pinjra Tod had expanded its mandate from “fighting the patriarchal discrimination against women university students” to get involved in anti-CAA stir, the Pinjra Tod member, who did not want to be named, insisted that they were only doing it out of solidarity. “That we were the trigger behind the communal violence that broke out thereafter, is a flawed and irresponsible narrative. It were people like Kapil Mishra who provided the trigger,” she argued.

252,['9/03/2020'],Lung transplant centre in city may be a reality soon,"Nagpur: The state government will clear all hurdles and bring a state-of-the-art lung institute in Nagpur soon, said secretary of department of medical education and research (DMER) Dr Sanjay Mukherjee on Sunday.

“This will not only bring advanced treatment for lung disorders to the city but also create ground for ambitious lung transplant facility here,” he added.

“MD pulmonology programme at the department of pulmonary medicine in Nagpur GMCH has completed 25 years which is a milestone. State government has been considering the proposal of lung institute by this department since long. We have decided to expedite this project with all possible cooperation,” said Mukherjee.

Lung institute is considered need of the hour for Nagpur because the city is surrounded by 14 big thermal power stations and residents are at risk of respiratory ailments due to pollution. Union minister Nitin Gadkari had assured in 2016 that he would bat for this institute at the central government level. After this, the department had submitted a proposal worth Rs600 crore which was pending with the DMER.

“Nagpur deserves this institute the most and we are very hopeful now as the state secretary himself has set the ball in motion,” said Dr Sushant Meshram, professor and HoD of pulmonary medicine, GMCH. The department had organized Pulmo and Sleep Meet 2020, a unique academic event on Sunday, to mark the 25th anniversary of the MD course and World Sleep Day that falls on March 13.

“We discussed a series of issues on sleep apnoea syndrome, progressive and end-stage lung disorders, and various aspects of lung transplants during this one-day event. A public forum on lung disorders was also held in the evening,” said Dr Meshram.

Dr Apar Jindal from Chennai gave presentation on the lung transplant scenario in India and challenges. “Average waiting period for lung transplant in the country is 6 to 36 months. This is because transplant surgeons have only about 4-6 hours to complete entire transplant operation after the donor lungs are retrieved. Still, lung rejection rate is going down in India. Survival period of transplanted lungs has increased from 3 years to 7.4 years since 2012,” he said.

Dr Jindal said that government support was necessary to bring the lung transplant facility in centrally-located city like Nagpur.

GMCH dean Dr Sajal Mitra, world renowned sleep medicine specialist professor Nancy Collap from USA, veteran pulmonologist Dr BR Maldhure and office-bearers of newly instituted Sleep Apnea Association of India attended the conference and shared their inputs.

Hope revives

Currently, there are only four active lung transplantation programmes in country

Three of them are in Chennai and one in Coimbatore

Lung institute in Nagpur may address challenges like demand-supply mismatch, lack of standardized donor management and geographical remoteness

Geographical limitations are foremost reasons due to which many donated lungs cannot be used

A helipad is also proposed at lung institute of Nagpur to get away with this limitation

The action has been taken after two people, from a 23-member Italian group, tested positive for Covid-19.

The group had travelled through major tourist places in Rajasthan and reached Jaipur on February 28. They were tested positive for Covid-19 on March 3 and 4.

Apprehensive of possible transmission of the disease, health authorities have denied entry of any hotel staff or guests in these rooms since they could become source of Covid-19 infection.

To disinfect these rooms, health authorities are using 1% sodium hypochlorite for mopping all hard surfaces such as handles, chairs, tables, etc.

“We disinfected 13 rooms in the hotel, where the Italian group stayed. After that we sealed the rooms for at least 14 days to ward off risk of transmission of the disease to other people staying in the same room,” said Dr Dinesh Kharadi, CMHO, Udaipur.

The tourists spent one day (February 22) in Bikaner, two days (February 23-24) in Jaisalmer, one day (February 25) in Jodhpur, and three days (February 26-28) in Udaipur before leaving for Jaipur.

In Jaipur, the health department sealed 16 rooms, in Jodhpur the entire floor, while 13 rooms were sealed in Bikaner after they were disinfected. “We are taking all possible measures to check the spread of Covid-19,” said Dr BL Meena, CMHO, Bikaner, while adding that they have kept 143 people in home isolation for 28 days, who came in contact with the Italian tourists.

Moreover, the health authorities have started door-to-door survey in the periphery of three kilometres of the hotels.

256,['9/03/2020'],Bravo! Cops ensure pet bird’s flight back home after missing complaint,"Nagpur: It was an unusual ‘missing’ complaint which even the complainant was hesitant to file, but Mankapur police not only accepted it but also reunited a family with their pet bird ‘Bravo’, an African Grey Parrot which is an exotic bird species, within hours.

Bravo belongs to Vinod Mahure, a senior manager at Western Coalfields Limited (WCL). The bird was brought from a breeder in Hyderabad around two years ago.

“My daughter, who is an MBBS, is a bird lover. She had bought Bravo for Rs50,000 with the money she had received as her first stipend. Bravo is a very intelligent bird and learns quickly. He is like a son to me and an integral member of our family,” Mahure told TOI.

According to Mahure, Bravo and their pet dog come to him as soon as he returns home from office in the evening. “And while having tea, I offer toast to Bravo who loves it,” he said.

On March 3, as usual Bravo approached Mahure after he returned home. “When I stepped outside for while to talk on the phone, Bravo too followed me. Before I could realize it, he had taken off and vanished. Though it was almost dark, we searched for Bravo everywhere but could find no trace.” So upset were they after losing the bird, none of them had dinner that night, said Mahure.

The next day, Mahure approached Mankapur police station and informed senior PI Vazeer Sheikh about the incident. “Initially, I was a bit embarrassed to approach the cops but the PI was very helpful. He took cognisance of my complaint,” said Mahure.

PI Sheikh immediately alerted other police personnel on wireless and gave them details about Bravo and his description.

During his meeting with the locals on the evening of March 4, PI Sheikh told them Bravo and also shared the bird’s pictures on social media.

When one of the residents informed Mankapur police that he had spotted a grey bird, cops along with Mahure rushed to the spot. “I had lost all hope of finding Bravo. But when I saw him sitting on a mango tree and called him, Bravo immediately flew towards me and landed on my hand. He was very frightened, thirsty and hungry after being away from home for almost 24 hours. It is a dying breed and they are a bit heavy, so it is hard for them to find food,” said Mahure.

259,['9/03/2020'],First loco pilot and train guard of NWR inspiring many,"Representative image

JAIPUR: Once considered male bastions like any other field, these women conquered them with their grit, hard work and family support.

Being a loco pilot or a train guard is a demanding job, but Durgesh Sankhla and Renu Verma have inspired many others to pursue this path.

Durgesh, 38, joined the railways as assistant locomotive pilot in 2011 and after working in Jodhpur division, she is now seen in various local and express trains in the Ajmer division.

“It feels great when people give me respect for being the first woman locomotive pilot in the North Western Railway (NWR). Though I am presently working as assistant locomotive pilot, I am sure with my promotion I would be able to handle the train fully,” said Durgesh, who is a known name in the fraternity of locomotive pilots in Ajmer division. She spoke to TOI soon after bringing train number 59608 from Pushkar to Ajmer on halt.

After Durgesh joined the service, she inspired many to become a loco pilot in NWR. “We now have 15 women loco pilots. They are disciplined and punctual in their duties,” said a senior officer of the commercial wing of the NWR.

Like Durgesh, Renu Verma, too, broke the ceiling by clearing the departmental exam to become a rail guard in September 2019. She is the only train guard in NWR. “I was working as gateman and thereafter was promoted as pointman. Sadly, it has been a male bastion and the designations are not gender-neutral. There was a departmental vacancy and I asked my husband if I can prepare for the test and apply for the post of guard and he supported me. Thus, I became a guard in September 2019,” she added.

Renu’s husband, who has a private job, is a proud man in Bandikui. “I feel very proud when people remind me that I am husband of the first train guard of NWR. My job was to support her. It is her sheer hard work and commitment that has helped her.”

Surat: Sleuths of anti-corruption bureau (ACB) nabbed a 47-year-old deputy town planner of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) for allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs1.50 lakh here on Sunday. The accused was nabbed near Udhna crossroads when he accepted the money while sitting in his car to dodge ACB. The accused had demanded money from an official of a commercial complex to not demolish unauthorized construction in the building.

Ashwin Tailor, deputy town planner in Limbayat zone, began to perspire heavily when he was caught, ACB sources said. The trap was laid by K J Chaudhary, police inspector, under supervision of N P Gohil, assistant director, ACB.

The accused had found unauthorized construction in a commercial building and served notice to its management. The building officials approached him to spare them for which Tailor demanded Rs1.50 lakh.

The accused told the complainant to come near DCB Bank on Udhna crossroads. When the complainant reached there, he saw the accused sitting in his car. Tailor asked the complainant to get in and accepted the money and immediately ACB officials entered the vehicle and nabbed him.

ACB officials informed that Tailor was already facing an inquiry of having disproportionate assets. ""ACB is inquiring into the wealth of a few SMC officers and Tailor is one of them,"" said an ACB officer.

Tailor has a tainted service record. He was suspended by municipal commissioner in 2017 for allegedly removing a page that had noting of top officials. The file was related to land demanded by a petrol pump owner near a heritage site. ""A departmental inquiry was ordered against J M Patel, deputy commissioner, Debashish Basak, town planner, and Tailor. Based on the findings of the inquiry, Tailor was suspended,"" the ACB officer added.

Tailor was reinstated in his job in November 2018.

""The disproportionate assets inquiry is continuing against Tailor. ACB is carrying out a search in his house,” the officer added.

262,['9/03/2020'],"Sans feeder service, Metro gets mostly weekend joyrides","Nagpur: The ridership of Nagpur Metro continues to remain abysmally low as MahaMetro has failed to provide feeder services at the existing stations and open new ones.

Services had started on Reach I (Sitabuldi to Khapri stretch) in March 2019. Five out of 11 stations had been started at that time and MahaMetro had promised to start remaining six by December 2019. However, so far only one new station — Jaiprakash Nagar — has been started. Feeder services, that too partial, are available only at Khapri station.

According to figures provided by MahaMetro, the daily average ridership of Reach I in December 2019 was 3,613. This reduced to 3,531 in January, 3,555 in February and 3,457 in March. Clearly, the figure is hovering around 3,500 mark. The ridership of Nagpur Metro as per the detailed project report (DPR) should be 3 lakh per day.

The situation in Reach III — Sitabuldi to Lokmanya Nagar stretch — is even worse. The ridership in February was 3,152 and in March it was 3,055.

Even these figures are misleading. The ridership is far higher on weekends and lower on weekdays. This shows that many Nagpurians still use the Metro for joyrides instead of commuting to their place of work or study. The ridership of Reach I on February 9, a Sunday, was 7,922 and 2,502 on February 11, a Tuesday. The ridership of Reach III on February 9 was 10,046, but came down to 3,071 two days later.

According to MahaMetro spokesperson, feeder city bus service is available only on four routes — Airport South and Airport to Beltarodi, Khapri to Mihan, Jaiprakash Nagar to Mhalgi Nagar and Jaiprakash Nagar to Jaitala.

The spokesperson said that proposals had been submitted to Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) for integrating Metro and city bus service. “About 4,500 persons travel daily from Sitabuldi to Butibori. We have asked NMC to run feeder service from Khapri station to Butibori so that these people use the Metro,” he added.

He further said that about 5,500 persons travelled from Sitabuldi to Hingna every day. “NMC should run feeder buses from Lokmanya Nagar station to Hingna,” he added.

On feeder services, the spokesperson said that 575 people were using Metro’s e-bicycles every day. “We are trying to start e-rickshaw services from March 25. These vehicles need charging point and we are setting up one at Khapri station,” he added.

263,['9/03/2020'],Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation bets on ‘Jan e-rickshaw’ for last-mile connectivity,"The AMC has already provided a parking dock for this new set of e-rickshaws opposite Keshavbaug

AHMEDABAD: The ‘ Jan e-rickshaw ’, the new electric rickshaw to be launched on Ahmedabad streets shortly is being positioned by the civic body to be its best bet for improving last-mile connectivity to homes and offices from bus or metro stations.

The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) feels the rickshaws will help increase city transportation use, which has been declining since the last eight years.

The Ahmedabad Municipal, Corporation (AMC) has already provided a parking dock for this new set of e-rickshaws opposite Keshavbaug.

When TOI visited the dock a few days back close to 20 odd e-rickshaws were parked.

“These rickshaws will help improve connectivity to interior residential and office areas of the city,” said a senior AMC official closely associated with the project. The figures give it away. The 89km BRTS coverage has, in fact, cut citizens’ total usage of the AMTS by nearly 18% since 2009 — defeating the very purpose of the mass transit system. Interestingly, the city's vehicle population has increased to 43 lakh from 24 lakh in 2009.

Transportation critics have pointed out in the past that the failure in tackling crucial issues like last-mile connectivity for public transport, subsidised road taxes and parking fees, integrating BRTS with other public transport systems as reasons behind lesser public transport use and traffic problems.

After the state election commission (SEC) released the schedule for municipal elections on Saturday, Vijay Kumar G Srkr, commissioner of municipal administration released ward-wise reservations for 16 municipal corporations and 103 municipalities across the state.

Reservations were declared for 672 divisions in municipal corporations and 2,123 wards in municipalities, Vijay Kumar said, adding that elections will be held only in 12 municipal corporations though reservations have been confirmed for all 16 municipal corporations in the state, following court orders.

As population in the city increased, the number of wards in the city was increased from 59 to 64 after the 2014 elections. Thirty-two of the 64 wards are reserved for women (19 for general women, 10 for BC women and 3 for SC women ), in keeping with 50 per cent reservations for women in local bodies.

Of the 19 wards reserved for general women, one will be allocated to the post of city mayor, based on reservations declared by officials.

Authorities of the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) and the Krishna district administration have started preparations for the local body polls. District collector and VMC special officer A Mohammed Imtiaz directed officials to follow guidelines while officials asked political parties to avoid putting up flex banners and other promotinal posters.

266,['9/03/2020'],Metro likely to face funds crunch next year,"Nagpur: As Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) have refused to pay any more money and the state government is not giving its full share, work of Nagpur Metro is likely to be hit severely in next financial year. The cost of the project is Rs8,680 crore and MahaMetro needs about Rs1,200 crore from the three agencies.

A source in MahaMetro said that the total share of the NMC and the NIT was Rs868 crore of which the two agencies had given only land worth Rs228 crore. “Both have refused to pay the remaining Rs640 crore. We have been repeatedly urging the state government for the last two years to force them to pay their share of money but are yet to receive a single communication in this regard,” the source said.

The state government itself is not paying its full contribution. MahaMetro had sought Rs518 crore in 2019-20 through supplementary grants but did not get a single penny. Now it needs Rs788 crore of which it was allocated only Rs245 crore in the state budget. Now, the state needs to pay Rs543 crore through supplementary grants. If it bears civic bodies’ share then it will have to sanction another Rs1,183 crore.

Of the state government share, Rs210 crore is equity, Rs181 crore is subordinate debt towards the state taxes and remaining is subordinate debt towards the central taxes.

Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has been urged by Metro officials to make the NMC and the NIT pay their share but to no effect. The NMC is ruled by Fadnavis’ party, the BJP. The former CM handled the urban development portfolio, which could issue directives to the NMC and the NIT. Moreover, even during Fadnavis’ regime MahaMetro did not get the entire amount it sought, which is the reason for the huge backlog.

On the other hand the central government and the foreign lending agencies have been prompt in paying their share. “So far, the centre has provided us Rs1,067 crore equity and only Rs47 crore remains. It has paid Rs418 crore as subordinate debt towards the central taxes and only Rs23 crore remains. The lending agencies have given us Rs4,219 crore and assured to pay the remaining Rs302 crore next year,” said the source.

Kavitha H’s husband Anand K had approached the high court alleging Sagar Hospitals at Tilak Nagar was demanding he pay a Rs 23 lakh bill towards his wife’s medical expenses and was threatening to discharge her.

“In the facts and circumstances of this case, the court deems it necessary to direct 4th respondent (Sagar Hospitals) not to discharge the petitioner’s wife from its care till the next date of hearing. The 4th respondent should also understand that if faulty treatment is given to the petitioner’s wife, it may be guilty of medical negligence,” the high court said in its interim order on March 3.

The matter is listed for hearing on March 16.

Sagar Hospitals did not respond to emails, messages and calls from TOI seeking to know its version of the events.

The patient’s husband also lodged a complaint of medical negligence against Sagar Hospitals with the Karnataka Medical Council, which issued a showcause notice to the hospital on February 26. KMC has asked both the parties to appear before it for a hearing on March 21.

Was meant to be a

day-care procedure

Speaking to TOI, Anand recalled the day (April 22, 2019) when his wife was taken to the hospital for a day-care procedure. “She was fit and fine and walking. We chose to get the surgery done during my daughter’s school holidays. It was a surgery that would cost just Rs 12,000. I was asked to pay the amount prior to the procedure which would be reimbursed through the Central Government Health Scheme. She was taken to the OT at 3pm. There was no intimation from doctors for the next three hours. Around 6.30pm, the doctors came out, only to say she wasn’t recovering,” said Anand.

Anand claimed till today the hospital hasn’t explained why his wife slipped into a coma. “According to some other specialists I consulted, my wife’s is a case of complication arising out of anaesthesia. The doctors who operated on her haven’t explained what went wrong,” he said.

BENGALURU: When Sania S Moula issued directions to remove vehicles from a no-parking zone and asked riders to wear helmet at several places in Shivajinagar on Sunday morning, many were left befuddled. For, the 15-year-old looked every inch a schoolgirl and wore no khaki. But those pulled up had no choice but to fall in line, as she sat inside a police jeep and shot off her orders.

Sania, after all, was playing the role of Shivajinagar traffic inspector, a job she had been assigned to mark International Women’s Day. Her mother Shabhana works at the traffic police headquarters as a head constable, while father S Moula, also a head constable, works at Anekal police station.

Sania, who had never visited a police station till Sunday, received a ceremonial welcome at Shivajinagar station. She immediately left in a police jeep, sitting on the passenger seat reserved for the officer to whom the vehicle is assigned. Inspector Anil Purohit, whose place she had taken, was at the wheel.

As they reached Balekundri Circle, Sania asked autorickshaw drivers why they had parked their vehicles at bus stops. While the drivers were initially confused, Anil introduced Sania to them. She also alerted riders speaking over the phone, warned them against not wearing helmets and directed her colleagues to clear vehicles from a no-parking area.

“It was an exciting day. It also instilled confidence in me. I thoroughly enjoyed my stint as a cop inside and outside the police station,” Sania later told TOI.

Shabana said it was not just an honour for her daughter but for women in general. “Purohit, who worked with me at the traffic headquarters, asked me to bring my child and explained about their Women’s Day celebrations. I am happy she gained a lot of confidence,” she said.

Sania is a class 10 student of Ujwala Vidyalaya at Whitefield.

272,['9/03/2020'],Woman dies of KFD in Wayanad,"Kozhikode: Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) or monkey fever has claimed one life in Wayanad , with a 48-year-old woman succumbing to the disease at the Kozhikode government medical college on Sunday. This is the first KFD death in the state this year.

Meenakshi, the deceased tribal woman, hailing from Narangakunnu Colony at Kattikulam near the Kerala-Karnataka border was admitted to the Mananthavady district hospital on March 4 with symptoms of the disease and were shifted to the medical college on March 6.

Three other people who tested positive for KFD are under treatment, with two persons admitted to Kozhikode medical college and one at the Mananthavady district hospital.

Wayanad DMO Dr R Renuka said that the condition of the three patients was stable. There have been 13 positive cases so far this year and nine patients were discharged after recovery.

The department has stepped up surveillance and preventive measures in view of the KFD season, normally coinciding with the summer months, but those in high-risk categories are reluctant to get vaccinated, the DMO said. All the reported cases this year was from the Thirunelly panchayat which is surrounded by forests, she added.

Health department authorities said people living on forest fringes and those venturing into forests for livelihood like collection of minor forest produce, wood, etc, have been directed to get themselves vaccinated.

Applying insect repellent ointments, using anti-tick lotions on domestic animals grazing in forest areas are some precautionary measures. Forest department staff too have been directed to take KFD vaccination.

KFD is transmitted primarily through bites of infected ticks (Heamaphysalis spinigera). The KFD outbreaks coincide with high nymphal activity of Haemaphysalis spinigera ticks — the main vector of the disease — during January to May. Monkeys acquire infection through infected tick bites and act as amplifying hosts with the virus getting transmitted to other ticks on monkeys.

AHMEDABAD: The management of Karnavati Club on Sunday issued a notice to the restaurant contractor at the club’s fine-dine restaurant, seeking explanation of poor hygiene in the kitchen. The decision came after a video shot by a club member went viral, where the club restaurant kitchen is shown in a filthy condition, with filthy floors and dirty vessels.

Narrating the sequence of events, a senior club management official said, “The member placed an order for food at 2.17am on Sunday at the restaurant which usually closes by 3pm. After finding hygiene compromised, the member immediately stormed into the kitchen around 2.45pm and shot a video and later circulated it among club members. When the in-charge at night intervened in the matter, asking the member to file a complaint, the said member refused to register an official complaint and instead, left the premises without even paying the bill.”

Sources said that when the restaurant contractor was verbally asked for an explanation of the kitchen condition, he said that cleaning of the restaurant was going on as it was near closing time.

276,['9/03/2020'],"Gujarat: At Nahri restaurants, tribal women cook recipes of success","Each outlet makes a turnover of Rs 50,000 or more every month

SURAT: Flavour’s quintessentially tribal in every spirit of the word here — from taste to the décor — in the Nahri restaurants.

Structured as a tribal hut, flavours of freshly cooked vegetables wafting in the air, menu written in a blackboard and served by women staff dressed in red or blue sarees — the distinctive feature in each of the 13 Nahri restaurants — which has managed to create a niche for itself in south Gujarat with its epicurean spread.

Nahri, the name taken from the tribal dialect meaning food for the guests, started with one restaurant in 2007 at Gangpur near Vansadahas to spread the taste of authentic tribal food in the region. Today, the chain of restaurants conceptualised and developed by BAIF Development Research Foundation opened 13 more doors across three districts.

Thousands flock to these restaurants located in remote tribal areas to savour nagli (Ragi) rotla with bamboo pickle, but very few would know that behind the curtain, the ropes are managed only by women of a self help group (SHG).

Nahri is a successful business model today with each outlet making a turnover of Rs 50,000 or more every month on an average. Even some of the more popular restaurants earn around Rs 70,000 per month.

""We are now working towards branding of the concept. We want this network of restaurants to spread gradually. We are now planning to give Nahri the look of a chain restaurant and also bring uniformity in its menu,"" said Sandip Yadav, senior programme manage, BAIF Development Research Foundation.

Nahri has eight branches in Dang and five in Navsari and Valsad. The latest addition is a meal-on-wheel concept in which a Nahri restaurant has been started on a mini truck by SHG of Savarkhadi village.

""The truck goes to different locations on each days of the week where weekly markets take place. While people get good quality food on the spot, we get good business,"" said Mani Dawda, programme operator, BAIF.

The restaurants serve only one dish — Dangi Thali comprising Nagli or Rice Rotla, green vegetable, black gram dal, rice, bamboo pickle and a chutney of green and red chillies.

“The dish was finalised after testing nutrition value of various tribal food items with support of Tata Trust,"" said Yadav. In developing the chain of restaurants to this level BAIF received support of NABARD, ONGC and department of science and technology of central government.

""The women members of SHG come from needy financial backgrounds and work at their own farms besides serving at the restaurants on rotational duties. The earnings have helped them ensure education for their children and medication for their family members,"" Dawda added.

280,['9/03/2020'],Manoj Tiwari: BJP to initiate dialogue with Muslims on CAA,"Manoj Tiwari

NEW DELHI: To dispel “misinformation” over the amended citizenship Act, Bharatiya Janata Party has decided to initiate dialogue with Muslims living in riot-affected areas of northeast Delhi.

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said the party will soon engage professionals and eminent members of the community with “rational thinking” to reach out to prominent Muslims and religious heads. He added that a panel comprising non-political individuals from the community would be set up, who along with local party functionaries would call small meetings of residents and discuss the merits of the Act.

“We will build a team of neutral and non-political people with diverse professional backgrounds to interact with the members of the Muslim community. Initially, they will go to Muslim-dominated areas in northeast Delhi and may later visit other parts of the city too,” Tiwari, who represents northeast Delhi in the Lok Sabha, said.

At least 53 people were killed and over 500 injured in violent communal clashes in several parts of northeast Delhi in the last week of February. A large number of people were forced to abandon their houses and either leave Delhi or live with friends or relatives in other parts of the city for the fear of being targeted by the other community.

According to a trade body, property worth at least Rs 25,000 crore was burnt or vandalised in one of the worst communal riots in the capital since the 1984 anti-Sikh carnage.

Tiwari said that BJP had been trying to tell people across the country that CAA had nothing to do with Indian Muslims and added that the members of the community must come forward now to bust the myth around the Act. “They should tell the community not to fall prey to illusion being created by some. Those leading the anti-CAA protests are doing it for political benefits but it is causing heavy losses. Progressive thinkers should initiate discussion in the community. If a group of intellectuals from the community explain this to people, they will definitely understand,” the Delhi BJP chief added.

The ruling YSR Congress (YSRC) is leading the race in selecting candidates. Competition for tickets is high, with as many as five candidates competing in some wards. Vijayawada Central legislator Malladi Vishnuvardhan, party in-charge of Vijayawada East Devineni Avinash and endowments minister Vellampalli Srinivas will finalise the list of candidates by Monday evening. The YSRC is also focusing on selecting candidates for the post of mayor, reserved for a woman from the general category.

Meanwhile, some YSRC candidates have started a door-to-door campaign in the city.

The party is focusing on publicising development activities undertaken by it in its five-year-long tenure in the municipal council. The TDP is also preparing a manifesto for the development of the city and is likely to submit a report to party chief N Chandrababu Naidu and finalise the list of candidates on Tuesday morning.

The Jana Sena, which is contesting local body elections for the first time, is focusing on giving tickets to party workers who have supported it since its inception. Demand for Jana Sena tickets in Krishna Lanka, Balaji Nagar, Ramalingeswara Nagar and Kothapeta is high as the party fared well in these areas in the 2019 general elections.

Left parties, the Communist Party of India (CPI) and the Communist Party of India (Marxist), have decided to contest the local body elections together. Both parties have a significant cadre in the city and are looking to win a majority of the seats.

However, no Zika-associated microcephaly cases have been identified in the country, till date reports the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)- National Institute of Virology (NIV). The other viral outbreak being the Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus. Since its first detection in the country in 2011 in Ahmedabad, many sporadic outbreaks of CCHF have been investigated in Gujarat and adjoining Rajasthan. “A nation-wide survey by the ICMR-NIV Pune, revealed wide seropositivity amongst sheep, goat and cattle population across the country.

283,['9/03/2020'],Motorists may soon pay the price for defaulting penalty,"Thiruvananthapuram: City police may soon start recommending temporary suspension of driving licence of motorists who fail to remit penalty. A decision in this regard has been taken owing to the poor response of the motorists in following the instructions in the challans served to them and remitting penalty.

City police commissioner Balramkumar Upadhyay said that only a very small percentage of total persons booked had remitted the penalty.

“We are currently mulling over issuing three warnings to motorists and if they still ignored the notice, we would be forwarding their case to motor vehicles department with a recommendation to suspend their driving licence temporarily,” said Upadhyay, adding that the warnings would be issued in regular intervals within a period of two months.

The number of traffic offences detected by the city police had spiked more than ever in the past few months after the police started relying on mobile phone cameras instead of normal inspections.

Cases are also being booked based on the images and videos sent by public to the TC Vigil WhatsApp number of the city police. But it has been noticed that majority of motorists booked through police camera and TC Vigil WhatsApp number are ignoring the challans served.

In January alone, over 6,000 two-wheeler riders, including pillion riders, were booked for riding without helmet . But only over 1,000 persons remitted the penalty.

Similarly, the total number of riders booked for the same offence in February was just over 7,000. But, the number of people who remitted penalty was just 1,913.

“Our aim is not just to detect more cases but to make the erring motorists accountable for their offence and discourage them from repeating the offence,” the commissioner said.

According to M K Zulfiquer, assistant commissioner (city traffic, south) the normal procedure followed in the past was to forward the case to the court when the motorist failed to remit the penalty.

“It takes a lot of time to process the case files and forward them to court. Hence, often very few cases are randomly chosen and sent to courts. The court also refuses to entertain very old cases. As a result, a vast majority of offenders go scot free,” he said. The new system, if implemented, will ensure that all motorists booked are held accountable no matter how late it is, he added.

Currently, police are carrying out a special drive ‘Operation Head Gear’ to book two-wheeler riders and pillion riders who do not wear helmets. The aim of the drive is to encourage maximum riders to adhere to helmet rule and thereby reduce fatality owing to head injuries.

The drive kick-started on March 1 will conclude on March 31.

287,['9/03/2020'],Ward 33 residents start crusade to stop weekly veg market in their area,"Nagpur: Buoyed by the success of anti-encroachment drive undertaken by municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe , citizens of ward no. 33 in South-West Constituency are now up in arms to put an end to the weekly vegetable market set up on the main road and narrow internal lanes of their residential areas on every Monday.

Residents from Samrat Ashoka Colony, Kashi Nagar, Rameshwari Road, Dwarkapuri and Hawrapeth have requested the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and police department to ensure continuous drive against encroachments in their area.

The NMC, following mayor Sandip Joshi ’s policy to take stringent action against encroachments on roads and footpaths, kicked-started its drive on January 1. Mundhe, who assumed charge in the NMC on January 28, started action against weekly vegetable markets on main and internal roads in residential areas from February 1.

The action committee formed by the citizens of ward no. 33, while appreciating the drive against vegetable markets across the city, pointed out problems faced in their area due to a weekly vegetable market for the last 12-13 years. They met Mundhe and all four corporators of the ward to request them to shut the market.

According to the committee, they staged a silent demonstration on February 10 and 17 extending support to the NMC’s drive while demanding a similar action in their area. “A few vendors manhandled some of the residents. On February 24, we did not allow vendors to set up stalls. NMC and police deployed their teams to shut the market on March 2. But few vendors created hurdles. NMC lodged a complaint with Ajni police station and offence was registered against 20 persons,” the committee stated.

NMC and police teams were in the area from 2pm to 9.30pm, after which few vendors set up the market again,” the citizens said.

The citizens added that continuous and stringent action is needed to keep a check on vendors who are backed by anti-social elements. A group supporting the vendors is threatening us. There is a racket behind setting up of this market, they said.

On February 21, ward’s corporators Manojkumar Gawande, Vandana Bhagat, Vishaka Bante and Bharti Bunde lodged complaints with Joshi demanding stringent action against the market.

According to Gawande, residents are suffering a lot due to the market. “Earlier, the market used to be set up only on Rameshwari main road but now stalls are coming up even on internal lanes which are just six-five metre wide. Entrance to residential units are blocked. Also, vendors dump garbage and urinate in the area. NMC should set up a daily market on an open area nearby,” he told TOI.

288,['9/03/2020'],Jamuna Prasad Saroj appointed first Dalit chief of Apna Dal(S) UP unit,"Jamuna Prasad Saroj

LUCKNOW: BJP ally Apna Dal (Sonelal) on Sunday played the Dalit card by appointing Jamuna Prasad Saroj as the party’s first Dalit state president. Saroj, MLA from Soraon reserved seat in Prayagraj, hails from Pasi community, the second largest group after Jatavs among the Dalits.

Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati is a Jatav.

Saroj’s appointment comes days after BJP’s estranged ally, Om Prakash Rajbhar, founder of Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP), entered into a political alliance with Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad. Azad is expected to float his political outfit on March 15, the birth anniversary of BSP founder Kanshi Ram.

The elevation of 52-year-old Saroj, a postgraduate from Kanpur University , is seen as Apna Dal’s bid to consolidate its position among Pasis, who account for 16% of the Dalit population in the state. Jatavs account for around 57% of the total Dalit population.

Saroj has replaced Rajendra Prasad Pal , an OBC, who has been elevated and made party’s national general secretary. Apna Dal (S) spokesperson Rajesh Patel said party chief Anupriya Patel decided to elevate the two leaders to key higher positions after taking their qualities into consideration and consulting senior party leaders.

Saroj is MLA from Soraon, an assembly segment in Phulpur seat, which was represented by UP deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya until Samajwadi Party’s Nagendra Pratap Singh wrested it from BJP in 2018 byelections. But BJP regained the seat in 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

Apna Dal (S), which is a Kurmi (backward) dominated party, is tying to make inroads into Dalit vote base in the run up to 2022 UP assembly elections.

289,['9/03/2020'],Water supply to be disrupted in city areas tomorrow,"Thiruvananthapuram: The water shortage faced by various areas in the city is likely to continue even after Attukal pongala. Several areas are facing water shortage after KWA began stocking water for pongala from March 6.

A day after pongala, KWA will shut down the 74mld treatment plant on Tuesday to do maintenance of a valve in the line bringing water from PTP Nagar tank to Vellayambalam area.

KWA has announced shutdown from 10am to 4pm on Tuesday for valve maintenance works. Areas to be affected include Thirumala, PTP Nagar, Maruthamkuzhy, Pangode, Kanjirampara, Vattiyoorkavu, Kachani, Nettayam, Malamukal, Kulasekharam, Valiyavila, Kodunganoor, Kundamankadavu, Kallumala, Mannarakonam, Punnakkamugal, Mudavanmugal, Poojapura,Karamana, Nemom, Pappanamcode, Thrikkanapuram, Kaimanam, Karumam, Kalady, Attukal, Manacaud, Kamaleswaram, Ambalathara, Beemapally, Poonthura, Valiyathura and Vallakadavu.

Sources in KWA said that it was difficult to operate a valve in the line which brings water to Vellayambalam area. “We have done temporary works to make it operational. We waited till pongala as the maintenance works demanded a shutdown. Now, the work will begin on Tuesday. Around 6 hours will be needed,” said KWA officials.

Areas such as Vellayambalam, Kowdiar, Kanaka Nagar etc. are affected by water crisis for the past few weeks. The shutdown will only worsen the water crisis in the city. Sources said that it would take around 24 hours to normalize water supply in elevated areas after the shutdown.

Interestingly, KWA has been supplying additional 15mld water per day to the city after the recent renovation of the plants at Aruvikkara. Though additional water has been pumped to the city for over a month, it has not reflected on the water availability in the city. Sources said that elevated areas continue to suffer while people in the low lying areas are using more water in the summer. “KWA lacks automated valve control systems. The manual operation of valve is not effective in ensuring water availability in all areas. The additional 15mld water should have to be efficiently diverted to elevated areas,” sources said.

KWA officials said that water available at Peppara reservoir was enough to meet city’s requirements till June. The water level at Peppara was 103.45 metres on Sunday.

290,['9/03/2020'],Dhoni on a mission to stay master of his own destiny,"Chennai: When Martin Guptill’s throw from the deep broke the stumps at the striker’s end to finish M S Dhoni and India’s dream of winning the 2019 ODI World Cup in England, it seemed to be the end of the road for the former Indian captain, at least on the international front.

Dhoni kept adding fuel to the fire by deciding to stay away from international cricket for the next eight months, but there were enough indications from all quarters that he wouldn’t stop playing for Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ) anytime soon. But the issue whether Dhoni should be considered for India again stayed alive. In fact, there’s a rumour going around that when during finalisation of the new national selection committee last week, the common question to the aspirants was whether they would consider Dhoni for the World T20s in Australia later this year.

While there are quite a few among the bosses at Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) who believe Dhoni shouldn’t be considered for India anymore because of his audacity to take an eight-month sabbatical from India services, the detractors can’t really say that with conviction. They know it doesn’t take too long for the narrative to change in Indian cricket and a few match-winning cameos from the maverick’s bat during the IPL can swing things in his favour all over again.

And given Dhoni’s track record with CSK, it’s not an impossible dream. Dhoni has stayed the epitome of consistency for CSK in the 11 seasons that he has played for the team and there have been different shades to his relationship with the franchisee. It started in 2008 as an unknown quantity and Dhoni showed his calmness and maturity to build a team in the first three years. Once the groundwork was done, from 2011-13, it was only about the rise and rise of CSK — it was a success similar to Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona — a team that was running away with everything in football during those years. And then the match-fixing scandal happened and it was in those turbulent four years that the Dhoni-CSK relationship actually grew stronger. Dhoni played for the Pune franchisee for two years, but was open about his love for Chennai, which endeared him to the fans even more. And on CSK’s return, it was Dhoni who went against all popular notion of T20 being a young man’s sport and built a ‘Dad’s Army’, which won one title and lost the second in the last ball of the tournament.

But 2020 is a different story altogether. It is for the first time that Dhoni is going into an IPL where he has to prove to the world that he is still good enough. Most believe that even if he decides not to play for India anymore, he wants to do it on his own terms. And for that, a brilliant show in CSK colours is necessary.

Dhoni, on his part, is leaving no stone unturned. Yes, he hasn’t played international cricket for a while, but since January, he has been training very hard in Ranchi. And since the beginning of March he is in Chennai to prepare for the two-month grind. ""Till last year, Dhoni always landed with a few days to go and a week’s practice was enough for him. But this time, it’s a proper pre-season and he is going flat out in practice. And make no mistake, he is super fit,"" bowling coach L Balaji, who is supervising the sessions, told TOI.

While Ambati Rayudu and Suresh Raina had landed in February, quite a few others like Piyush Chawla, M Vijay, Monu Singh and Sai Kishore have joined since Dhoni has arrived. Harbhajan Singh and the others who are not playing at present are also expected over the next one week. ""With Dhoni here, the atmosphere is fantastic. The younger players, who may find it difficult to pick Dhoni’s brain during the IPL, are finding it easier now to interact with him and learn more,"" Balaji said.

The live streaming of the practice sessions are available too on social media and the fan frenzy has already started around Dhoni. On every practice day, there are a few thousands at the Chepauk to watch the master at work. It’s going to go up and Dhoni knows how much this midsummer madness means to his Chennai followers. Come IPL, he will look to make all of them happy, just as he will try to make a quiet point to the world that he is still master of his own destiny.

293,['9/03/2020'],Gujarat: Only 2% of Rs 2.17 lakh crore budget set aside for women,"Representative Image

GANDHINAGAR: Though the Gujarat government claims its budgets are designed to empower women, the actual financial allocation for women has been limited. After analyzing the Gujarat government’s gender budgets, Mahender Jethmalani of Pathey Budget Center said: “The state government must be appreciated for presenting gender budget statements since 2014-15 to earmark more resources for gender equality and to address women’s concerns, needs, and vulnerabilities.” Jethmalani went on to say: “But the gender budget statements need many improvements.”

The gender budget under Category A is Rs 4,505.89 crore, Jethmalani said, which is just 2.07% of the state’s total budget of Rs 2,17,287 crore. Currently, 24 departments report GB (Gender Budget) allocations under Category A (100% women-specific schemes) and Category B (33% to 99% mixed schemes). Of the 24 departments, only 15 have formulated 100% women-specific schemes.

“Nine departments are yet to formulate 100% exclusive schemes and programmes to address women/female needs,” Jethmalani said. He further said,“Currently, GB statements provide information on women-specific schemes under Categories A and B without budget codes.” He said women-specific schemes under GB statements should represent budget codes so that allocations can be verified from the detailed budget estimates of departments.”

Jethmalani added, “The Gujarat GB statement provides budgetary information under the proposed provisions for the next financial year and probable expenditure for the previous year but not the actual expenditure.” The GB statement should also present the actual expenditure to verify the claims, he said.

Jethmalani said that officials formulating schemes for GB should have practical knowledge of the discrimination through the life cycle of girls and women to respond to practical and strategic needs. Therefore, they should engage with women’s groups, he said. The departments should adopt the strategy for gender responsive budgeting, Jethmalani said, to help integrate a gender-inclusive perspective across the planning, budgeting, implementation, monitoring, and auditing continuum.

295,['9/03/2020'],BJP’s outreach plan: Rs 50cr for rural roads,"Lucknow: In a rural outreach ahead of the 2022 assembly elections, the ruling BJP has released funds for construction of roads connecting hamlets with a population of 250 people.

In the first phase, public works department has sanctioned Rs 20 crore for construction of connecting roads in villages of 11 districts, including chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s bastion Gorakhpur, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav’s parliamentary constituency Azamgarh, Ballia, Deoria, Kushinagar, Maharajganj, Farrukhabad, Kanpur Rural, Etah, Chitrakoot and Banda.

According to a communiqué dated March 7 sent to PWD engineer-in-chief Rajiv Ratan Singh, the department said Rs 50 crore would be required for construction of connecting roads in the 11 districts, of which around Rs 20 crore has been released in first phase.

The department has demarcated roads assembly seat-wise to zero in on areas needing a road connectivity. Significantly, Azamgarh has bagged the lion’s share as 43 rural areas spread over nine assembly seats of the district are proposed to be taken up by PWD. Likewise, 15 hamlets in Gorakhpur are proposed to be developed under the project.

The move is seen as the Yogi government’s bid to project its developmental agenda and consolidate its position among the rural masses, even as BJP gears up to take on the two regional satraps — SP and BSP —which have a significant vote bank essentially in rural areas.

According to the letter issued by the department, the work should be started only after technical assurance from the competent authority. The department has also fixed the responsibility of PWD engineer-in-chief to ensure the quality of construction and timely completion of the project. Also, the funds would be utilized as per the requirement and should not be kept in the bank or post office.

The department has also directed that the spending of the funds would be verified by the state government from time to time.

The department has also asked the engineer in chief to ensure that the work of connecting roads is done by any other government source. The labour cess would, however, be borne by the labour department.

297,['9/03/2020'],Another drunken driver takes a life on city road,"Thiruvananthapuram: In an incident similar to the accident in which journalist K M Basheer was killed, a labourer engaged in road work was killed after he was hit by a car driven by a drunk driver in the city on Saturday night.

The accident occurred near Ambalamukku under Peroorkada police station limits.

According to the police, Johnfred (38), who was a resident of Irayankode near Cheriyakonni is the deceased. He was a contract labourer of BSNL.

He was knocked down by a speeding car around 11.30pm on Saturday while he was engaged in digging the road for maintenance works around 200 meters away from Ambalamukku Junction. There were a few other labourers with Johnfred.

They were saved after they ran to safety after seeing the vehicle approaching in their direction at a dangerous speed.

Though he was rushed to hospital his life could not be saved. It is alleged that the car that rammed Johnfred was moving along the wrong lane, from Peroorkada to Ambalamukku direction.

The police said that the car was driven by Ajayaghosh (54), a businessman residing at Ambalamukku. The police have recorded his arrest, charging him with the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder (IPC 304).

Besides this, sections 279 of IPC (rash driving) and 185 of Motor Vehicles Act (drunk driving) were invoked against the accused. He was produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody on Sunday.

Johnfred leaves behind wife Sandhya and three children, Jyothish (6), Jyothi (4) and Jyothika (1). He had been working as a labourer under contract with BSNL for the past nine years.

298,['9/03/2020'],BCA to begin search for a new Ranji team coach,"Vadodara: Baroda team is set to get a new coach for the next cricketing season. The Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) management has already decided to embark on its search mission for a new Ranji team coach later this month.

The decision was taken as the current coach, Sanath Kumar, is recovering from a brain-stroke he had suffered earlier this month. “We will have an important annual general meeting (AGM) on March 19 after which we will begin search for the new coach. We are looking for an experienced hand who can manage the players and coach them well,” said Ajit Lele, BCA secretary.

When asked if they have already listed any possible names, Lele said, “Former India cricketer Chandrakant Pandit’s name is being considered. His current term with other cricket association is ending. Also under considerations are names of Level III coach, Mukund Parmar and ex-India player Rishikesh Kanitkar.” He, however, was quick to add that they are still weighing options and nothing has been decided yet.

A section of BCA, however, feels that the association should go for a local coach. “Baroda has once won Ranji Trophy and later ended in the finals under local coach. BCA can rope in a local former cricketer instead of giving hefty fees to some outsider,” a BCA official said.

But the BCA management has no plans to hire a local Ranji coach as it feels that the locals get influenced by persons having vested interests.

After Kumar’s sudden exit, former India player Munaf Patel is playing the dual role of mentor as well as coach for Baroda. Kumar was appointed as Baroda coach in June last year by the managing committee. This Kumar’s second stint with the Baroda Ranji team as he had earlier worked here in 2011-12.

In his earlier stint as coach here, Baroda was champions in Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and performed well in Ranji tournaments. Fifty-six-year-old Kumar has played 11 first class matches between 1986-87 to 1988-89. “He suffered paralysis on the right side of his body but is recovering,” Lele added.

The chief minister was speaking after inaugurating ‘Kerala Nirmithi’, an infrastructure expo showcasing projects being executed under the aegis of the KIIFB at Alappuzha EMS Stadium

He said that it was not right to destroy KIIFB by levelling baseless allegations. On the allegations related to YES Bank against KIIFB, Vijayan said that KIIFB had withdrawn its deposits from the bank. “It clearly shows the alertness and correctness of KIIFB. The public is not showing any interest in the allegations being levelled against KIIFB. The goal of the government is to complete projects in a time-bound manner,” he said.

“KIIFB has an inspection system that is foolproof. All its dealings — receiving and distribution of funds — are completely transparent. It ensures maximum quality for the projects and their execution in tune with the deadline. The listing of masala bonds on the London Stock Exchange shows that even agencies from abroad are taking notice of KIIFB’s activities,” said the chief minister.

Pravasi Chitty has been able to mobilize Rs 150 crore, and Rs 50 crore was collected through Pravasi dividend scheme in two months, he added.

“The state government has promised the people that it would undertake development projects to the tune of Rs 50,000 crore in five years. However, we have already taken up projects worth Rs 54,000 crore even before completing four years,” Vijayan said.

“Over 250 projects funded by KIIFB in the state are in the last stages of fruition. In Alappuzha, 86 projects worth Rs 3,187 crore have been given approval,” he said.

Finance minister T M Thomas Isaac presided over the function. Food and civil supplies minister P Thilothaman and PWD minister G Sudhakaran were also present on the occasion.

The expo will conclude on Tuesday.

CBI will try to find answers to questions like how the pistol found its way inside the jail, why was Bajrangi shot barely 12 hours after being shifted from Jhansi jail, and the motive for murder.

The case was transferred to CBI on the direction of the Allahabad High Court on February 25 which said the matter required an in-depth and impartial probe. Following the order, CBI lodged an FIR against Rathi on March 7. Although Baghpat police indicted Rathi in its chargesheet filed in court on October 15, 2018, but failed to establish the motive behind the crime and failed to trace the pistol used to execute the murder.

Talking to TOI, Seema Singh on Sunday said the police failed to probe whether Rathi was just a face and there was a deeper conspiracy behind her husband’s murder.

“The police did not carry out investigation against people from whom my husband faced threat to life. We had informed jail officials that my husband could be attacked inside jail but preventive measures were not taken. He was needless shifted to Baghpat jail,” she said.

303,['9/03/2020'],"Whitefly eats into coconut trees, agri crops in Telangana &amp; AP","HYDERABAD: An alien invasive crop pest, the Rugose Spiralling Whitefly (RSW), is wreaking havoc on a large number of coconut groves, banana plantations and other horticulture and agricutural crops across Andhra Pradesh and Sattupally and Khammam districts in Telangana .

Native to Belize in Central America , the pest was first reported in Tamil Nadu and Kerala in July 2016. Experts have classified RSW as a destructive pest that mainly threatens coconut plantations. “The species has damaged coconut trees across large areas and is attacking other host plants as well,” Dr S J Rahman, principal scientist, All India Coordinated Research Project on Biological Control of Crop Pests, told TOI.

According to Indian Council of Agricultural Research-Central Plantation Crop Research Institute (ICAR-CPCRI), the pest has destroyed 200 host plants in the coconut-producing states of south India, raising serious concerns.

The insect, which derives its name from its egg-laying pattern, is a tiny insect measuring up to 2 mm in length that sucks out sap from under the leaves, inducing stress on the host plant from the loss of water and nutrients. The honeydew excreted by the fly attracts ants and encourages the growth of fungus, thus affecting the plant.

Scientists said that in many cases, economic losses resulting from whitefly infestations are limited and that deficit monsoon due to climate change is one of the key reasons behind the growing pest attacks.

Biological control by parasitic insects, such as Encarsia, lady beetles and spiders, has been found to be effective against RSW. The agricultural department has suggested application of starch solution, installation of sticky traps and spraying of neem oil to kill the pests.

Over the last few years, the trend of using cow dung cakes (or chhana) have picked up and this time dozens of groups and residential colonies have decided to use only cow dung cakes in Holi.

“We know the effects the climate change is having on the globe. Ahead of Holi, many trees get cut which directly impacts our environment. So we have decided to use cow dung cakes instead in our Holi puja. Burning cow dung cakes also purifies air,” said Nikhil Purohit of Manav Prakruti Kendra. Some organizations have also begun supplying such cakes for low rates in the city.

The old city markets were abuzz with customers on the eve of Holi with grown-ups buying dates and puja ceremony articles, the youngsters gunning for the water cannons and Holi arsenal.

Those celebrating Dhuleti too have taken to organic colours to prevent harming the skin. Meanwhile, farsan shops in the city are also busy preparing to serve customers who flock eateries after playing with the colours.

MANGALURU: Deputy chief minister Govind Karjol on Sunday exhorted the media in the state to focus on rural areas of the state and the country as well. Reminding the fourth pillar of democracy that 70% of India resides in rural areas, Karjol said it is this strata of society that needs greater focus compared to issues of urban areas, especially the farmers who play a pivotal role in ensuring food security for the society at large.

Conferring the annual awards of Karnataka Union of Working Journalists at the valedictory of the two-day 35th journalists conference on Sunday, Karjol said the media should focus on the nation’s development.

“This development should not be limited to industries, but also farmers, who have success stories on judicious use of water. Karnataka stands number one in this aspect, and farmers who have adopted this practice should be the focus of attention,” he said.

Exhorting agricultural and horticultural universities to focus on their achievements as well, Karjol said when these positive examples are highlighted, the society will reap benefits of their collective wisdom. There are several such success stories in areas of horticulture, agriculture, irrigation, coconut and coffee growing, he said, adding if these examples get highlighted, the state can certainly go up the national ranking in conservation of water resources.

Referring to various demands that the KUWJ flagged with chief minister B S Yediyurappa during the pre-budget meeting, Karjol said he will personally strive to get the Rs 5 crore welfare fund that the chief minister announced in the budget get increased to Rs 50 crore. “I will strive to ensure Rs 5 crore is granted for construction of a patrika bhavan in Bengaluru, and increase the amount set aside for their construction at the district level from the present Rs 25 lakh,” he said.

Highlighting the contribution that Mahatma Gandhi played in fostering journalism in the pre-independence era with the ‘Young Indian’ and ‘Harijan’ and the impact that these papers had on the freedom movement, Karjol exhorted KUWJ to institute an award in the name of the Father of the nation. This will spur young upcoming journalists to know about the role that Gandhiji played, he said, adding this is as important as remembering veteran journalists as well.

Earlier, Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel likened journalists to guru (teacher) who have power of trinity – Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh– to create, sustain or destroy.

“Journalists play this role in the lives of politicians by pointing out their mistakes and help them get better,” he said. KUWJ announced that the 36th journalist’s state conference will be held in Kalaburagi. Karjol, who is district minister of Kalaburagi, assured his full cooperation for the event.

Mangaluru: A session on coastal development and tourism organised as part of the final day of the two-day 35th State Conference of Journalists under the aegis of KUWJ underscored the need for Karnataka to exploit its 320 km coastline for tourism. Speakers cited the success that Kerala and Goa – coastal states that flank Karnataka—in achieving their tourism potential as the prime reason for the state, that is bountifully blessed, in achieving the same.

Underscoring the potential of coastal tourism, KUWJ in association with DKWJU, the host association of the conference, organised a session on Rani Abbakka , a river cruiser , and not at the conference venue. More than 100 journalists and guests were part of the session that saw the cruiser go up the Phalguni River, all the way up to the river bridge across the Nethravathi River from the Old Port, before returning to the Old Port.

M Rathnakar Hegde , chairman, Coastal Development Authority (CDA), who inaugurated the session, said the sea and the rivers in the coastal districts are their major assets. Despite this, tourism has not grown to the expected level, he said, adding the tourism development department, CDA and other agencies are working in tandem to tap this potential as part of the coastal tourism circuit that has been mooted, and will get the priority the sector needs.

Ganesh Karnik, former MLC, who was the chief guest, said Karnataka offers far more diversity in coastal tourism options compared to Goa and Kerala. “It is imperative for this diversity to be showcased to tourists, especially foreigners, so that tourism can be further developed locally. Apart from the tourism department, the district administration should join hands with stakeholders in giving the necessary fillip for tourism, not just in coastal areas, but in the interiors as well,” he said.

B A Viveka Rai, former vice-chancellor, Kannada University and KSOU, who chaired the session, wished that the assurances made, and projects conceptualised for the development of the tourism potential of the coast do no end up as mere promises. “Local culture and practices should be highlighted in tapping this potential while creating employment for locals,” he said. A website that captures this diversity should be launched to attract tourists in droves to this place, he added.

State guarantees are contingent liabilities and pose a burden to the state if they are invoked. “Guarantees have to be considered seriously when you look at the state’s liabilities. If the entity that has taken the loan cannot repay it, then the state has to step forward,” said former finance secretary Subodh Kumar (retd).

By 2016-17, the state had guaranteed loans worth Rs 7,305 crore. The guarantee bill has risen by Rs 39,586 crore since then. The largest share of guarantees or 36% of the total has gone towards the Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway.

The bulk of the guarantees granted in the last four years by the former BJP-led government were mainly for infrastructure projects. These include Mumbai Metro-4, Mumbai Transharbour Link project and Maharashtra Samriddhi Mahamarg, also known as the Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway. The former government guaranteed loans worth Rs 17,000 crore for the Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway in 2019, despite strong objections from the state finance department which said it would burden the cash-strapped state.

Budget documents show that in 2018-19, the urban development department had guaranteed loans worth Rs 19,131 crore, mainly for Metro-4 and Mumbai Transharbour Link projects; the cooperatives department had guaranteed loans worth Rs 3,941 crore; and the social justice department had guaranteed loans worth Rs 546 crore. The public works department had guaranteed loans amounting to Rs 804 crore.

In 2019-20, the state government granted guarantees to the Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway, which is extimated to cost Rs 55,335 crore. The 701km eight-lane expressway, which will cut travel time between the two cities from 14-15 hours to nearly eight hours, is expected to be completed in 2020-21. It also guaranteed loans worth Rs 1,800 crore to the Cotton Corporation of India .

Budget documents also show that the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank had invoked guarantees on loans worth Rs 2,322 crore given to cooperative sugar and spinning mills. Of this, Rs 1,049 crore was found to be payable by a claims committee. From the sum, the government paid Rs 74 crore in 2018 and Rs 100 crore in 2019.

313,['9/03/2020'],"In a first, govt allocates Rs 18 cr for infra spending to check migration","The fund was announced in the budget presented by chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat

DEHRADUN: To check migration from 545 identified villages, the state finance department has allocated a fund of Rs 18 crore to better infrastructure and public facilities in these areas. Each of these villages has a population of less than 50 people.

The fund was announced in the Budget presented by chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat during the assembly session in Gairsain on Thursday. The provision of corpus funds for migration has been made for the first time in the state budget.

According to studies, several villages have been severely hit by migration in the last ten years. Locals migrated from these villages due to several causes, including lack of facilities like hospitals, schools and employment opportunities.

Head of the state migration commission SS Negi told TOI, “The corpus fund will play a very important role in boosting the facilities and infrastructure in the affected villages and the commission will act as a nodal agency to monitor the projects and study the desired effects on migration.” Different departments have been directed to realign their developmental works to include the neglected areas where the population is thinning rapidly, he added.

In Uttarakhand , the migration trends reveal two broad categories — people shifting within the state and people moving out of the state. Migration studies point out that lack of employment opportunities is the major factor behind outward movement of people and lack of other basic facilities is also a big contributor to the trend.

“The villages, where population is less than 50 individuals, lack health facilities which forces people to move to urban areas,” said Negi.

However, there are some who feel that the issue of migration has been underestimated by policymakers and successive governments in Uttarakhand. “The corpus fund of Rs 18 crore alone cannot stop migration or herald a wave of reverse migration in Uttarakhand. People leave their native villages in search of job opportunities, better education and health facilities. Work should be done in all these areas to check migration,” said Doon-based social activist Subhash Sharma .

NASHIK: In the four-year period of 2016 to 2019, as many as 3,902 people lost their lives in 9,260 road accidents across the district. Moreover, 7,648 people escaped with injuries — both grievous and minor.

Given a large number of accidents and deaths, the Nashik Regional Transport Office (RTO) on Saturday organised a brainstorming workshop at the Children’s Traffic Education Park to analyse the accidents and come out with measures to bring down the numbers.

“The highest number of road accidents take place on relatively open roads — like the state or national highways — where there is scope for motorists to speed their vehicles. Overspeeding, wrong-side driving and overtaking from the wrong side lead to maximum road accidents,” said Vinay Ahire, the deputy RTO of Nashik.

“An analysis has revealed that older vehicles were involved in the least number of accidents, whereas vehicles that are less than five years old were involved in the maximum number of accidents,” Ahire added talking on concerns about the road-fitness of older vehicles.

It was also found that the highest number of accidents take place between 3 pm and 6 pm and two-wheeler riders account for most fatalities.

The insights provided by Jitendra Patil, the joint transport commissioner (Road Safety Cell, Maharashtra), RTO Nashik Bharat Kalaskar, chairman of Nashik First Abhay Kulkarni, project director of NHAI Bhausaheb Salunkhe proved useful to all RTO officials and inspectors of Nashik, Malegaon, Srirampur, Ahmednagar, Dhule, Nandurbar, Jalgaon and Dhule and officials of the NHAI and other departments.

315,['9/03/2020'],HR Bhardwaj Death: Former governor of Karnataka Hans Raj Bhardwaj passes away,"Hans Raj Bhardwaj

BENGALURU: Congress functionary and former governor of Karnataka, Hans Raj Bhardwaj , who had been ailing for some time, passed away in New Delhi on Sunday. He was 83.

Although Bhardwaj served as Union law minister for years, he hit headlines when he sent chief minister BS Yediyurappa to jail during his stint as governor from 2009 to 2014.

Appointed by the UPA government as the President’s hand in the state after he was asked to vacate his post as law minister, Bhardwaj had kept Yediyurappa — in his second stint as CM between 2008 and 2010 — on tenterhooks.

When two lawyers — Sirajin Basha and KN Balaraj — approached him in 2011 seeking sanction to prosecute Yediyurappa for his alleged involvement in land denotification cases, Bhardwaj obliged. It resulted in the BJP strongman becoming the first sitting CM to be sent to jail and triggered political upheaval in the state.

Yediyurappa eventually split from the BJP and formed his own party, before returning to the saffron party fold later.

""Bhardwaj’s death is sad news,"" Yediyurappa said in a tweet. ""In his death we have lost a good legal expert and administrator.""

HD Deve Gowda, former PM, said, “Bhardwaj will always be remembered for his exceptional service to the nation.”

NASHIK: The Cantonment General Hospital at Deolali has recently approved a proposal from Cantonment General Hospital to rename its Intensive Critical Care Unit (ICCU) to High Dependency Unit (HDU) in order to not mislead the civilians about the facilities available in the hospital.

The Cantonment Board Deolali (CBD) officials said that since their ICCU does not have the required facilities that an intensive care unit should have, they have decided to call it HDU.

Bhagwan Katariya, vice-president, CBD, said “The board had put the proposal for the same in the previous board meeting and it has been resolved to change the name of the ward.” An HDU, according to the board officials, is in between of ICCU and emergency wards. It is a midway facility.

317,['9/03/2020'],Kerala: Crusader for woman-friendly workplaces,"Kusumam R Punnapra

KANNUR: When the state government finally declared that provisions of the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961, would be applicable to employees of private educational institutions, including those in the unaided sector, and that they would be eligible for maternity benefits, including six months paid leave, Thiruvananthapuram-based social activist and writer Kusumam R Punnapra couldn’t have been happier.

It was her fight that finally bore fruit, as is the case of earlier laws that enabled IT employees to get maternity leave and also the right to breastfeed their babies during working hours.

“I had been fighting for this right for quite some time and I am happy that it became a reality on Women’s Day,” she said.

It all began when her daughter landed a job in a reputed IT company right after completing her engineering degree, said Kusumam. “Though I thought my daughter was very lucky to get campus placement, it did not take long to realise that working conditions were every tough and long working hours without any rest were quite common in IT firms,” she said. Finally, her daughter migrated to the UK, where working conditions are much better, but that was just the beginning of Kusumam’s struggles to bring relief to young professional women, after studying labour rules.

The first fight was to ensure the rights of young mothers to breastfeed their babies. It bore fruit, too, though she had to run from pillar to post till the 2015 gazette notification, which said establishments with fifty or more female employees should have day-care centres and facilities to breastfeed their babies within 500 metres of the workplace. “I have seen many young mothers undergo great agony, both physical and mental, unable to breastfeed their babies,” she said.

The amendment to the Kerala Shops and Establishments Act was revolutionary as it made it mandatory for the employer to provide the facility for newborn babies to have their mothers’ milk, even at their workplace.

The fight to get six months maternity leave for techies was also an arduous one and the law was finally passed by the central government in March 2017.

Now, her fight is to have day-care centres near the Secretariat for female staff.

“There are causes aplenty to fight for but we should have the will, which should not be limited to Women’s Day or Breastfeeding Week,” said the crusader, who has devoted her retired life for the cause of working women.

AHMEDABAD: Ghanshyam Sharma, 32, of Naroda has lodged a complaint with the Krishnanagar police station stating that a couple — Mitesh Raval and his wife Payal of Kapadvanj — has cheated him of Rs 13 lakh on the pretext of getting him a job in the central government. Police officials said that they have registered an offence under Sections 406, 420, and 114 of the IPC and are hunting for the accused couple.

According to the complaint lodged by Sharma, one his relatives had introduced the Ravals to him at a religious function in Kapadvanj about two years ago. They had exchanged phone numbers at the time. Sharma, who is in the plastic bags business, stated that in January 2018, Mitesh called him and asked him to pick him and his wife Payal from Dehgam Circle.

“Police source said when they came to Sharma’s house, Payal saw Sharma’s qualifications — BA and BEd. She told Sharma that she can get him a central government job but he would have to pay Rs 15 lakh,” a police official said. Later Mitesh and Payal again came to Sharma’s house and showed him some letters. Sharma fell into their trap and paid them Rs 5 lakh. The Ravals then told Sharma that he would have to come to Delhi with them to give an interview.

According to Sharma, he gave the Ravals Rs 3 lakh more in July 2018 and another Rs 5 lakh in September 2018. However, whenever Sharma asked for the appointment letter, the Ravals told him to wait. After one-and-a-half years, Sharma went to Kapadvanj to meet the Ravals but found them missing. Their phones had been switched off. Sharma then realized that he had been cheated.

NASHIK: The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has frozen the bank accounts of 269 industries and seized immovable properties of eight companies for defaulting payment collectively amounting to Rs 23.33 crore. Moreover, the EPFO has also recovered Rs 37 crore from over 1,000 defaulting companies during the current financial year (2019-20) in the Nashik region.

The Nashik region of EPFO includes five districts — Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon, Nandurbar and Ahmednagar.

There were 1,636 private establishments, civic and cooperative bodies, which had altogether defaulted on payment of Rs 60.95 crore. “We had started recovery from these defaulters. We could recover Rs 37.62 crore from the defaulters,” said an EPFO official.

“Moreover, we have also taken frozen bank accounts of 269 establishments for defaulting on Rs 23.33 crore. The immovable properties of eight establishments have also been attached,” the official added.

All private establishments, which have 20 or more employees come under the PF Act. These establishments must provide PF facilities to their employees. Apart from private establishments, cooperative institutes and civic bodies also come under the ambit of this Act.

Currently, there are total 12,917 establishments and 17 lakh accounts in the Nashik region along. Apart from that, the EPFO has 1.35 lakh pensioners in the region.

The monthly PF collection of the Nashik regional EPFO office is estimated to be Rs 84 crore, while payment distribution is at around Rs 62.90 crore per month. This includes Rs 30 crore pensions to 1.35 lakh pensioners.

EPFO has classified defaulters in three categories A, B and C as per the duration of a payment default. The EPFO has decided to act tough against employers who default PF payment of their employees. The organisation has also decided to monitor such defaulters every month. As part of this, a real-time default management system has been introduced at the Nashik regional office of the EPFO,” said an official.

The category A includes defaulters who defaulted payment over four months, B category includes defaulters from two to four months and C category includes defaulters who have defaulted payment over one month.

The squad immediately approaches defaulters by phone calls, SMSes and emails, asking them to pay the defaulted amounts. If there is no response, the squad serves notices to the defaulters, giving them an ultimatum, said the official.

New mayor Satish Kulkarni has taken several initiatives on sanitation and health services in the city. In a free-wheeling interview with TOI’s Tushar Pawar, Kulkarni shares about the various measures taken for the overall growth of the city and his vision to make the city an IT hub.

How is the financial condition of the civic body?

Various development projects are being carried out across six divisions of the Nashik Municipal Corporation . The financial condition of the civic body is neither too good nor too bad. It is balanced. But the focus is being given on basic amenities like roads, street-lights, water, and other facilities.

What is your vision for the city?

Nashik is a part of the Mumbai-Pune-Nashik golden triangle, but only Mumbai and Pune have developed a lot and Nashik has been neglected in terms of development. How will employment be generated if the new industries do not come here? Hence, we are already in talks with two IT companies to make some investment here. We are also organising a one-day event in the city, inviting big IT companies where we will urge them to make an investment in Nashik.

What are the issues in the city and how is the response to your visit to the respective wards?

Providing basic facilities like water, road, street-light, health services, garbage collection, etc are the duties of the civic body. Hence, I am holding dialogues with city residents in various wards every Saturday to understand the problems they are facing. I have also launched a mobile app – ‘Maza Mahapaur’ to address the grievances of the city residents. I am getting a very good response from the city residents and I am also trying to settle their issues.

There are any financial issues after the new MVA government coming to power?

The development of the city is not only the responsibility of the civic body but also of the state government. We hope we will get funds from the Maha Vikas Aghadi government for various development works.

What are your plans for making the Godavari river pollution-free?

We are seriously working on river conservation. There are 29 nullahs in the city that connects to the Godavari river. The nullahs are causing pollution to the river. We are planning to construct a parallel pipeline along these nullahs for the effluents to flow into Sewage Treatment Plant. In fact, nullahs should only flow for four months of the rainy season. We have Godavari conservation plans, which require funds worth over Rs 400 crore. We are soon meeting the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and union minister to seek funds for the project.

Some city hotels were under NMC’s scanner for releasing stale food and waste. What are your views?

This is really wrong if the city hotels, wedding halls, and lawns are throwing stale foods into the sewer and stormwater lines. In fact, they should give their waste with segregation into dry and wet garbage to garbage collection vans. If they are still not following this, then action should be taken against such erring city hotels. I have already directed the civic administration to take action against such city hotels.

As city mayor, what are your top priorities?

Cleanliness, health services are on the top of my priorities. I want to make Nashik the cleanest city in the country. Measures are taken in that direction by the civic body. Moreover, I am also working on sorting out the parking issues in the city.

NASHIK: Grape exports from the Nashik district seem to have gathered momentum, with officials announcing that nearly 63,000 tonne of the fruit has been sent out in 4,705 containers so far.

There is still a 17% dip in export numbers. Last year, during the corresponding period, exporters had sent out 75,000 tonne. Farmers said the dip was the result of unseasonal rains that had devastated the region’s vineyards in 2019.

Out of the 63,000 tonne exported so far, 55,000 tonne were sent out to European countries — 36,000 tonne to the Netherland; 6,700 tonne to the United Kingdom; 6,500 tonne to Germany; 1,200 tonne to Denmark. The rest of the grape export was to countries such as Finland, Slovenia, Spain, Ireland, Norway, etc.

Nearly 8,000 tonne of grapes has been exported to non-European countries such as Russia, the UAE etc.

The grape export season will continue through the end of April. Officials said the district’s grape export is expected to touch nearly 1.1 lakh tonne this season. Last year, the number settled at 1.44 lakh tonne.

The district also recorded a 26% drop in the registration of vineyards meant for export during the grape season 2019-20 (December to April). According to government rules, grape farmers have to register their vineyards if they wish to export their produce. As per the state agricultural department, so far, around 28,500 farmers in the district have registered their vineyards for export — that’s across a total of 18,000 hectare. Last year, 38,400 grape farmers had registered their vineyards, across 24,575 hectares.

“The drop is because of last year’s unseasonal rainfall that impacted vineyards through September and October. Most of the good quality vineyards, meant for export of grapes, have been badly damaged. It is difficult to estimate the damage, but we believe there has been a 25 to 30% drop in production,” Manik Patil, the senior office-bearer of the Maharashtra Rajya Draksha Bagayatdar Sangh, said.

Khandu Shewale, a grape farmer and exporter, said: “Many ready-to-harvest vineyards were badly affected by rains in October. I incurred 100% losses. Last year, I had exported 150 tonne of grape. But I could not export anything this year.”

Mangaluru: Activist Swami Agnivesh asked people to observe a non-cooperation movement against the Union government by not showing documents during the enumeration drive. He was speaking at an anti-CAA rally held under the aegis of Paurathva Samrakshana Vedike at Jappinamogaru on Sunday.

He called on people to intensify their protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizenship (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR). The protest was organised to oppose the CAA and to condemn the violence that took place in Delhi.

He said, “Write this on the walls (that you will not show documents). Make students raise slogans when they go to the school and return home. We have to do this in order to save the Constitution. Your voice should be so loud that it should break their eardrums.”

He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi continues to lie about the CAA and its link with NRC.

The BJP manifesto mentions the CAA and NRC and home minister Amit Shah, on the floor of the Parliament, has given the sequence about the CAA, NPR and NRC. “The Prime Minister continues to give false statements,” he said.

Karnataka assembly former speaker Ramesh Kumar said no force can curb the agitation against CAA.

AHMEDABAD: A Vastrapur resident and real estate agent, Dharmesh Dave, 39, filed a complaint on Saturday evening alleging that one Pavan Tiwari had threatened the complainant over a dispute in which Tiwari had been caught bootlegging 16 years ago.

The complainant, who lives in Takshila Flats near Nalanda Complex, claimed in his FIR with Vastrapur police that in 2004 he used to drive a rickshaw in Amraiwadi. One day that year, Dave’s autorickshaw hit Tiwari’s autorickshaw and the got into a scuffle. Dave then called up cops. When cops arrived they found Tiwari’s autorickshaw loaded with liquor bottles. Tiwari was booked for bootlegging but he later escaped from police custody.

“Since then, Tiwari carried a grudge against me and blamed me for being caught while bootlegging. He alleged I was a police informer, and after escaping from police custody he came and beat me,” Dave said.

He added that Tiwari had fled to Kanpur after the incident and did not contact Dave for around 16 years.

Dave said in his FIR that Tiwari had fled to Kanpur after the incident and did not contact me for around 16 years.

“On March 1, Tiwari called me up and said that he had returned to Ahmedabad city. He threatened to kill me if I ever came to Jashodanagar or Amraiwadi area,” Dave stated in the complaint.

Tiwari had once again called Dave on the same day and allegedly threatened to kidnap his wife and daughter, while abusing him.

Dave said that he had not filed a complaint earlier as he was scared and was busy with his daughter’s board exam. He approached Vastrapur police late on Saturday night and filed a complaint of criminal intimidation and uttering abusive words.

Inspector M M Jadeja of Vastrapur police said that the accused was yet to be nabbed and police are trying to trace him.

AGRA: Ahead of starting the evaluation process of UP Board examination answer sheets on March 16, the state secondary education council has debarred 103 principals, teachers and clerks in Agra division from it.

In this regard, regional secretary of the secondary education council has sent a letter with a list of debarred examiners to all the district inspectors of schools (DIOS) in the region.

The project, launched last year, aims at addressing women’s safety issues, especially in public places.

Prof Shubhra Gaur of MICA, guide for the project, said that the students visited colleges, schools and public places such as roads, malls, BRTS and Sabarmati Riverfront, to understand current scenario of crimes against women and its prevention mechanism.

“Based on the insights they generated, some of the suggestions made to the police department include creative visual manual and interactive games for efficient and effective information dissemination,” she said.

Aditi Garg, a student participant in the urban immersion project, said that they even recreated a scenario of eve-teasing. “We recreated the scenario of a girl going alone near Shivranjani crossroads. At 1pm, it was busy but still we experienced verbal teasing and catcalls by a few passersby. Ahmedabad is comparatively safer than a few other Indian cities, still it was an exercise to identify improvement areas,” she said.

“We studied other similar initiatives in cities such as Udaipur and Bengaluru to identify the identity issues and branding. Working closely with police also exposed us to various issues faced by the force, especially female cops,” said Karamveer Singh, another student on the project.

AHMEDABAD: He is currently the associate director of Heart Institute, executive director of Cardiac Interventional Services and director of Interventional Cardiology Division at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles — right in the neighbourhood of glitzy Hollywood. But talk about Ahmedabad and Dr Rajendra Makkar’s eyes light up.

“It’s where I was born and brought up. We lived in Sabarmati as my father was an engineer in ONGC,” said Dr Makkar on Sunday. “I attended St Xavier’s School and later NHL Municipal Medical College. I still remember that we used to go to the Sabarmati Ashram to study, drawn by its serene environment.”

He is visiting India, and Ahmedabad is one of the cities where he is collaborating with cardiologists and surgeons to talk about and teach the transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedure. In 2019, his unit performed about 700 such procedures, making it one of the busiest centres in the US.

“I was interested in the procedure since its early days and got trained,” said Dr Makkar. “It was fascinating for me to replace a heart valve without stopping it. Earlier, it was seen as a safer procedure for older patients suffering from stenosis (narrowing) of aortic valve due to factors such as degenerative calcification. But now it’s used in several scenarios, some cases involving patients as young as 15.”

But primarily, such procedures are meant to improve quality of life, he said. “About eight years ago, I performed this procedure on a 100-year-old patient. He lived six more years and was active till his last breath,” he said. “With longevity in India improving over the years, I believe it would be popular in the time to come.”

The cardiologist left Ahmedabad in 1990s and first got trained in Michigan before moving to San Francisco. “In three decades, technology has been a great leveller globally,” he said. “Today Gujarati surgeons, and Indian surgeons in general, are performing similar procedures. The difference comes in factors such as infrastructure and health insurance. But as far as skills are concerned, I don’t see much of a difference.”

The move came in connection with the ongoing hearings to protect the Taj Mahal from pollution.

The samples were taken by NEERI scientists from Kosi drain, Masani drain, Bengali Ghat pumping station, Ambakhar drain and Gokul barrage areas of river Yamuna in Mathura.

Talking to TOI, social worker Gopeshwar Nath Chaturvedi, who has been associated with the cleaning of Yamuna, said that samples were taken from five major points that have been polluting the river. “Led by Dr Praveen Kumar, the NEERI team had visited Agra to collect samples,” he said.

According to environmentalist MC Mehta, the team had taken water samples based on his plea for protecting the Taj Mahal which is indirectly affected by the pollution in Yamuna river. He pointed out that there are two drains situated close to the monument and without making the river pollution-free, ‘clean Taj’ would remain just a dream.

Chaturvedi said that the Ganga Action Plan was started in 1985 after Mehta approached the apex court. In 1998, Chaturvedi had filed a PIL in Allahabad High Court to make Yamuna pollution-free.

In the last hearing in the apex court when Mehta pleaded about the rising pollution levels of the river from Delhi to Firozabad in UP, the court ordered for submission of the report by NEERI.

Chaturvedi also criticised the way the Centre’s flagship Namami Gange Programme was being implemented. He said that the unplanned work will act as a hindrance in making river Yamuna pollution-free in Vrindavan and in Mathura.

“Without including Kosi drain in the plan, the stretch of the river in Vrindavan can’t be cleaned,” Chaturvedi said. He added that under the Namami Gange plan, Mathura has been divided into four zones, however, the work is in progress in only two zones (trans Yamuna and Masani zone).

Even a detailed project report (DPR) for the other two zones - Masoom Nagar zone and Koyala Alipur zone - has not been prepared so far, he claimed.

PATNA: There is tussle between allies Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal for a Rajya Sabha seat from Bihar with the former claiming the same while the latter denying that there was ever any “commitment” to give away the seat.

In a letter written to leader of the opposition in the assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav , which was released to the media on Sunday, Bihar Congress in charge Shaktisinh Gohil reminded RJD of its “commitment” to give one of the two Rajya Sabha seats from the state which the allies can win on their own.

Gohil said in the letter that Yadav had “categorically” said at a joint press conference of Mahagathbandhan during Lok Sabha elections that one seat from the “RJD quota in Rajya Sabha” will be left for Congress.

“Hope RJD fulfils its promise,” he said in the letter.

However, RJD vice-president Shivanand Tiwari denied that his party had made such a commitment to Congress. “RJD’s state president Jagdanand Singh had also made this clear. However, (RJD chief) Laluji has been authorised to take a decision on this matter,” Tiwari said.

Of the five Rajya Sabha seats from Bihar for which elections will be held, based on their resepective strength in the assembly, JD(U) and RJD can win two each while BJP can win one seat.

On speculations about his candidature, Gohil said, “If Congress gets the promised Rajya Sabha seat, its candidate will be a leader from Bihar only. Anyone like me, who is not a voter in Bihar, will not be a candidate of Congress.”

Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy inaugurated the first Disha police station at Rajamahendravaram on February 8, while deputy chief minister SB Amzath Basha inaugurated the second Disha police station in Kadapa on the same day. The state had announced that 18 Disha police stations would be established across the state.

On Sunday, Chittoor district collector Dr Narayana Bharat Gupta inaugurated two Disha police stations in Chittoor district.

338,['9/03/2020'],Thackeray announces Rs 1 crore donation for temple in Ayodhya,"Ayodhya: Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday evening offered prayers at the Ram Lalla makeshift temple in Ayodhya’s Ramjanmabhoomi site, marking 100 days in power with a reiteration that Hindutva remains the core tenet of Shiv Sena’s ideology, despite splitting with BJP.

Before the 4:30pm darshan of Ram Lalla, Thackeray accompanied by wife Rashmi and son Aaditya, announced a donation of Rs 1 crore to the newly formed Ram Mandir Trust for construction of the temple, emphasizing the money would be from his personal account and not from state coffers.

“This is my third visit to Ayodhya in 18 months and by the blessings of Lord Ram, I have become chief minister. It’s a sad day for those who claimed the Maharashtra government won’t complete 100 hours. I have parted ways with BJP, not with Hindutva. BJP is not the custodian of Hindutva,” he told reporters in Ayodhya during his curtailed itinerary in which he skipped the Saryu aarti and a public event due to the coronavirus threat.

The Sena leader’s visit to Ayodhya triggered an undercurrent of resentment from seers and the saffron fringe, who view Thackeray’s coalition with NCP and Congress as a betrayal of the Hindu cause as parties of these leaders had termed Lord Ram as an “imaginary character”.

Before Thackeray arrived by road from Lucknow, the district administration swiftly doused fires by putting two senior seers and the Hindu Mahasabha president under house arrest to quell black flag demonstrations. Those interned include Mahant Raju Das of Hanumangarhi temple, Mahant Paramhans Das of Tapaswi Chawni Temple and Rakesh Dutt Mishra, president of Hindu Mahasabha, said SSP, Ayodhya, Ashish Tiwari.

Talking to reporters, Thackeray said, “I came to Ayodhya in November 2018 with soil from land of Shivaji. Then, Ram temple was in a state of flux. Again in November 2019, Supreme Court gave a historic decision and I also became chief minister. I have come here for a third time and whenever I come here, I bring good news.”

Disclosing his telephonic conversation with the UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday, he said, “I requested Yogiji to provide land for constructing Maharashtra Bhawan in Ayodhya to accommodate Ram Bhakts from the state.”

After Thackeray’s departure, Hindu Mahasabha leader Rakesh Dutt Mishra demanded that Ramjanmabhoomi should be “sprayed with water from Saryu and Ganga as the Sena chief minister had desecrated the holy site”.

It was for the first time that many of the women came to the police station despite their husband, father, brother or son working as a cop for years. Interacting with the family members of police personnel, Sawang urged them to encourage other women to approach police stations freely in case of any problem and to spread the word that police stations are woman-friendly.

Sawang set out actionable goals with 19 parameters divided into institutional, structural, environmental, behavioural and action-based goals to make police stations more woman-friendly. “Starting from today, all police stations will work towards fulfilling these parameters especially gender sensitive behaviour of police,” he said.

While interacting with the DGP, family members of police personnel thanked him for implementing the weekly off. Family members of DSP and above rank officials also demanded the DGP to give them a weekly off, to which Sawang replied with laughter, saying his wife also demanding the same. Kanti Rana Tata , mother of Anantapur DIG, thanked the DGP for the Disha mobile app

The DGP also inaugurated a Disha police station in Guntur on Sunday morning.

We have no Chinese items this time. All the products available were manufactured in Delhi-NCR. The cost of these products is at least 20% more than those made in China.”But more than the cost fact, the fear of contracting coronavirus is such residents donot want to go to public places and indulging in the usual Holi celebrations.The health authorities have issued an advisory to people to shun large gatherings to avoid catching the infection. “At Holi get-togethers, hugging and applying of colors cannot be avoided. People should prefer to stay at home,” said a doctor.Mayor Naveen Jain has also cancelled the annual Holi party organized every year by the civic body at city’s Paliwal Park. “Following the coronavirus scare, I will not be attending any programme on Holi and also advice citizens to stay at home and celebrate the festival with their family members,” he said.“Every year, I look forward to Holi.

341,['9/03/2020'],Ahmedabad: Charming snakes is her passion!,"Lakshmi Pandey

AHMEDABAD: A petite girl with a stick in one hand and a drip pipe in another took a look at an injured rat-snake on Sardar Patel Ring Road near Vasteal and rescued the reptile in couple of seconds. The incident happened at 1.30am this Friday. She put the snake in a box, nonchalantly handed it over to forest officials and returned to a hospital where she being treated for pneumonia for around a week.

This woman is Lakshmi Pandey, a 27-year-old PhD student from Ramol who is the only woman snake rescuer of eastern Ahmedabad.

Pandey has been into reptile rescue for 12 years, from the time she had started curing injured birds at the age of 15.

On her passion, she says, “My father runs an NGO which rescues injured birds and animals. I too volunteered to heal injured birds during the kite flying festival and then I gott interested in wildlife.”

After that, Lakshmi worked for three years to rescue pythons. But as pythons are not found in cities, she started rescuing snakes and monitor lizards.

Speaking more about her love for snakes, Lakshmi says, “We, human beings, have taken their space. We have cut forests, built houses on their space and when they (snakes) come into our so called territory, we kill them. This is injustice and that is why I decided to rescue snakes to help save their declining population.”

But Lakshmi also has to bear the disapproval of many people in the society. “People in our society usually fault me for still catching snakes when I have reached a marriageable age, or tell me that no one will marry me if I keep rescuing snakes. Sometimes, my mother is also annoyed, but I keep focusing on saving snakes,” she says.

On the most difficult movements during catching reptiles, she says snakes had bitten her in four instances during rescue. “But none of them were poisonous. Only four types of snakes are poisonous in Gujarat. Rest of them are harmless,” she says, adding that people should not kill snakes and inform forest officials to rescue them.

342,['9/03/2020'],‘Arabic becoming popular second language option’,"Madurai: A few days ago, more than 150 students of Class XI and Class XII in the district kicked off their state board exams by sitting language paper in Arabic. If the misconstrued concept that Arabic is only Muslim’s language is broken, it could become a much more popular second language option for students, said a teacher at Al-Ameen Higher Secondary School, K Pudur, from where majority of the students appeared for the Arabic exam.

“Arabic is easy to learn such as Hindi, French or Sanskrit. However, many people stigmatize it with Muslims. I’ve seen many Hindu students show interest in Arabic as well. If not for the stigma, it can garner more interest,” said Hamza Mubarak, Arabic master at Al-Ameen School. He said that on average, it takes only three months to learn reading and writing Arabic and just one or two years to become fluent.

“The uniqueness in the script is that Arabic is written from right to left. But, the consonants and vowels sound similar to those in other Indian languages, apart from a few exclusive special alphabets. The variation of alphabets is also not so hard to get the hang of it,” explained Hamza. Students who recently appeared for the Arabic exam said that once a student starts learning from a younger age, it is even easier to pick up. “I preferred taking Arabic over Tamil. The current pattern for state board Arabic exams is quite straightforward as well and it gives you the chance to score well,” said a student.

The headmaster of Al-Ameen School, S Sheikh Nabi, said that the school’s students want to learn the language mainly of their own interest and that demand has increased in recent years. “Now, we are having around 70 students in a class for Arabic. If other non-Muslim schools also include the language and hire faculty, I’m sure more students would take up the language as an option,” he said.

The teachers said that these days the language is highly useful for job opportunities in Gulf countries. “Many good opportunities are also available for those who want to pursue and study Arabic in higher studies. There is much demand for Arabic translators, including at United Nations,” added Hamza.

Justice G Jayachandran observed that the circular issued by the cooperative society does not prohibit from taking action against erring officials, as it is only suggestive in nature.

The judge observed that when dereliction of duty is not tainted with criminal intention, recovery proceedings alone is sufficient. “This is a clear case of fabrication of records and thereby, the petitioner and the other accused have caused loss to the society. The role of the petitioner in granting loan and tampering records has been spoken by the witnesses in their statements,” noted the judge.

The petitioner A Manivel was working as the circle supervisor of Trichy district central cooperative bank and his duty was to verify loan applications received by the primary agricultural cooperative society and forward the same to the district central cooperative bank. tnn

346,['9/03/2020'],Pune: Engineers to devise software to help police track stolen vehicles,"Representative image

PUNE: Blacklisted and stolen vehicles, and even those sporting duplicate number plates, will soon run out of luck on the city’s roads.

Engineers from the Government Polytechnic College , Pune (GPP), are devising a new system that will harness the existing intelligent traffic management system (ITMS) to track down — and eventually catch — these vehicles.

The engineers said the software should be ready in six months and believe that it would greatly augment the capability of the police in solving crimes.

“We are planning to strengthen the software and hardware of the current traffic management system of the Pune traffic police. We are currently in the process of developing this software and in less than six months, it will be in place,” GPP principal Vitthal Bandal, who is working on this project along with an engineer from the College of Engineering , Pune, said.

Under the existing system, traffic violations such as signal jumping, not wearing seat belts, and helmetless riding, among others, are detected and challans are sent to the vehicle owners.

“We are working on the same system by providing additional technology that would help police solve crimes. Vehicles that are on the blacklist, those that are stolen or even those sporting the duplicate number plates — which is a serious offence — can be detected once we calibrate the current system with our technology,” Bandal further said.

The Pune police department welcomed the initiative by GPP.

“The technology is very good and once in place, it will certainly help the Pune police department in monitoring suspicious vehicles. The process of solving crimes will also become much faster,” additional commissioner of police Sanjay Shinde said.

347,['9/03/2020'],AMU students’ panel to provide legal aid to those booked for anti-CAA stir,"Aligarh Muslim Universty

AGRA: Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) Students Coordination Committee on Sunday constituted a “legal helpdesk” at the varsity’s Bab-e-Syed to provide free legal aid to those who have been booked by the police while protesting against the contentious CAA across the city.

According to students, since many of the protesters were booked under false charges, there is a need to provide legal aid to them. The students’ committee was formed after the December 15 violence. It comprises lawyers and teachers, mainly to assist the ‘booked protesters’.

Talking to media, Imran Khan of the coordination committee said the “fascist” regime has plans to demonize their peaceful protests against CAA and also target Muslim activists.

“The government wants to criminalize our dissent. So, the committee has planned to constitute a legal helpdesk to fight the witch-hunt by this fascist regime, under the leadership of senior advocate Asad Hayat,” said Khan, adding that local advocate Ifraheem Chaudhary and Pradeep Kumar will also assist them. This desk will be functional at the protest site at Bab-e-Syed for three hours from 6 pm to 9 pm daily starting from today.

“The AMU coordination committee appeals to citizens of Aligarh to contact us if they feel there is any necessity of legal aid. This help will be selfless,” said Khan, adding that pamphlets in this regard will be distributed across the city.

According to committee members, “We, the people of India, have the right to put our counter ideas against government policies which harm our culture and ethos. It generally seems that government of India is targeting a community during the anti-CAA, NRC and NPR movement.”

Meanwhile, the students also appealed to the state government to release legal activist advocate Mohammad Shoaib of ‘Rihai Manch’. Shoaib was picked up by the police from his Lucknow home a day earlier.

Condemning Shoaib’s arrest, members of the coordination committee, said, “We stand in solidarity with him and appeal to the government that he must be released immediately and unconditionally.” Notably, Shoaib was arrested on December 19 and later granted bail. He was again arrested on March 7.

While Sequeira is from Sanguem, the other two are from Curchorem, police said.

Police sources said that the accident occurred at around 4.30pm. While two of the minors died on the spot, the third succumbed to his injuries at Hospicio Hospital, Margao, sources said.

Police sources said that the three were inside the car when the accident occurred. Police said that the car was speeding and it veered out of control of the driver while manoeuvring the difficult terrain leading to the vehicle hitting the rocks, leaving the car a mangled wreck.

Following the accident confusion prevailed over which police station held jurisdiction over the location as it borders that of Verna and Maina Curtorim police stations, leading to considerable delay in registration of the accident.

The Maina Curtorim police are conducting further investigations.

Meanwhile, locals have complained of car drag races being held at the Verna plateau during weekends, and have urged the police to act.

As many as 90 pioneer limited edition units will be delivered, which include 45 for Europe, 25 for the US, and 20 for the rest of the world. We are also dealing with some potential clients in India. PAL-V is installed with Rotax engines, the most common engines used in light aircraft. All aviation freaks in the world know about this engine.When will India see flying cars in its skies?First, we will prepare a feasibility study to see what purposes the Indian government want the flying cars for. It could be used for disaster management, coast guard, flying doctors, police squad, or military use. Based on our feasibility study, we will present two machines for these applications with a special price tag. From there on, we are looking at setting up a supply chain and perhaps an assembly line in the near future.Is PAL-V looking at India for setting up an assembly line?The Netherlands and India have good relations. China wants us to come there. We are looking at setting up an assembly line in India for the Asian market. There is a lot of knowledge of and expertise in the aviation industry in India. That’s what we are looking for right now. It may become a reality in fewer than five years depending on the acceptance by the governments and the agreements we make with a variety of parties as well as the government here. This depends also on the value which will be offered by the Indian government. It doesn’t make sense to set up an assembly line in India if only 50-70 high networth individuals are going to buy our flying cars, which are currently being made at Raamsdonksveer in the Netherlands.How do you see Gujarat as a potential location for your assembly line?We are talking with the Gujarat government for a memorandum of understanding (MoU).

However, the traps “failed” in 38 instances, but during subsequent inquiries the ACB filed bribe demand cases and arrested the officers.

Rajesh Bansode, superintendent of police, ACB, said that none of the traps “failed” owing to the involvement of insiders.

“The 184 trap cases include 38 “failed” trap cases,” he said.

Citing reasons for failure of “trap” cases, Bansode said, “In majority of failed traps, the government officers became suspicious and refused to take bribes. At the same time, they carried out the work of the complainant.”

The traps also “failed” due to sudden transfer of government officers or they not being present on that day, he said.

A senior ACB officer said, “Sometimes, it has happened that the panch (witness) did not report on time and the officer, in question, had left the premises.”

“The ACB analyses the reasons for the failure of trap cases and tries to avert such incidents in future,” he said.

However, before trapping a government officer, the ACB takes due precautions, such as recording of calls, establishing long pendency of work of the victim, unnecessary delays and remarks passed by the government officer in executing the work, and others.

“If the case fits into any one of these categories and the demand is confirmed, a case is filed against the government officer,” Bansode said.

“If the officer demands money to execute government work, it confirms his/her involvement in bribery,” he said.

Bansode said that the ACB had collected evidences against government officers and filed bribe demand cases against them.

“Thus, despite failed traps, we have filed 38 incidents under demand cases and officers have been arrested in all the cases,” he said.

The materials were seized in the presence of RPF witnesses as no private citizens were present.

After a case was registered against Alaysius and a search was conducted at his house the next day, RPF officials seized 46 railway cylindrical roller bearing and various engineering and mechanical materials. Based on the statement given by Alaysius, a search was conducted at Anwar Hussain’s shop where several items were seized.

The Trichy JM II court in 2013 acquitted the both Alaysius and Anwar in the case. An appeal was filed by RPF in 2014 challenging the acquittal. Anwar died during pendency of the appeal.

Justice M Nirmal Kumar observed that no independent witnesses were examined and all the witnesses to the seizure are RPF personnel. The judge further observed that there was no distinct identification mark to prove that the valves seized belonged to the railways and whether all the materials seized were easily available in the open market.

The judge also observed that some of the witnesses in the seizure did not supported the case of the prosecution as they admit the articles were old. Therefore, the judge observed that the search and recovery is doubtful.

When asked about it, Sylendra Babu replied that he would look into it.

According to sources from fire service stations, the department did not provide enough ropes to each fire service station. “A few weeks ago, a cow fell into a well near Thondamuthur. But the newly opened Thondamuthur fire service station did not have even a single rope. Immediately, two ropes were brought from the South Fire Service station and the cow was rescued. Most of the fire stations are having just two ropes, which is not enough. The department should give at least seven ropes to each station,” the source said.

When asked about the supply of ropes, joint director (fire and rescue services) S Vijayasekar said the department has enough ropes. Sylendra Babu said the department has got funds under the state disaster relief fund and enough equipment will be supplied to the fires stations.

355,['9/03/2020'],Biodiversity board to use GIS data to map wetlands,"Panaji: The Goa State Biodiversity Board (GSBB) will seek access to information on the geographic information system ( GIS ) mapping of all water bodies in Goa currently being undertaken by the water resources department ( WRD ).

The board’s member secretary Pradip Sarmokadam said the biodiversity management committees (BMC), formed under the board in villages across the state, are in the process of identifying wetlands and water bodies in their jurisdictions.

He said the committees are also carrying out detailed mapping of the biodiversity supported by these wetlands and water bodies. The WRD data will help them in the process, he said.

This is the first time such mapping of the state’s water bodies is being undertaken. Except for rivers, the exact location of all other water bodies will be mapped during the exercise, including lakes, ponds, wells, nullahs, streams, springs and even reservoirs. With GIS mapping, WRD aims to enable online monitoring of any activity in and around a water body, thus making faster action possible in case of any violation.

Meanwhile, the Goa State Wetland Authority is in the final stages of notifying the century-old Bondvoll lake in Santa Cruz as Goa’s first official wetland. Sarmokadam said that work has already begun to get 35 other areas notified as wetlands.

The National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) has been appointed as an agency under the Goa State Wetland Authority to carry out ground study on the current status of wetlands in Goa.

Meanwhile, various committees are identifying water bodies and wetlands at their level and helping map their biodiversity, right from plants, to insects and bird life dependent on them. Once GSBB gets access to the GIS mapping data, it will help these committees collate data on their own and will make identifying wetlands easier and more accurate.

As per the wetland atlas prepared in 2011 by the space application centre in Ahmedabad, Goa has 555 wetlands.

356,['9/03/2020'],"Coronavirus in Goa: As a precaution, churches in Goa keep stoups dry, use sanitisers","PANAJI: Many Catholics across Goa who went for Sunday Mass noticed that the usual holy water stoups (fonts) at the entrance of the church were kept dry. As coronavirus spreads across the globe, churches and priests are doing their bit to keep it at bay, advising parishioners about safe practices during religious services.Although the state hasn’t reported anyone testing positive for coronavirus, and the archdiocese of Goa hasn’t issued any letter in this regard, priests are gearing up to combat any potential threat from the virus, given the thousands who attend Sunday Mass. Many churches across Goa saw their priests advise parishoners to receive Holy Communion in the hand rather than on the tongue, as is traditionally practiced.The priests’ move came after Archbishop of Bombay Oswald Cardinal Gracias issued a communication with suggested precautions regarding the virus. The letter, which was widely circulated on social media, was only addressed to institutions in Mumbai. However, owing to Gracias’ position as president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India (CBCI), many priests outside Mumbai also decided to follow his advice.Even though the archdiocese of Goa hasn’t issued any communication yet, Se Cathedral, the seat of the Archbishop and the mother church of the archdiocese of Goa, kept its holy water fonts dry on Sunday. Parish priest Fr Alfred Vaz said the precaution was taken following a government circular.“We decided to keep the fonts dry as there are many foreigners who frequent the place considering it is a world heritage site,” he told TOI.At Porvorim’s Holy Family church, priests and ministers used sanitisers, and advised the faithful to receive Holy Communion in the hand. “We haven’t forced people to receive Holy Communion in the hand as we haven’t received any directions yet,” parish priest Fr Caetano Fernandes told TOI. “We merely kept both options open, and told people that it would be preferable to receive communion in the hand.”He said that his parish took these precautionary measures as the church usually attracts a lot of people. “There are also many doctors among the faithful who are open to the idea. We have been following the news and read Cardinal Gracias’ circular. Parishioners are ready to accept what’s good,” Fernandes said.Meanwhile, at Our Lady of Help church in Ribandar and Carmelite Monastery, Margao, holy water fonts were kept dry. In many churches, the virus also found mention in the prayers of the faithful. Attendees were also advised to greet each other with a namaste, instead of shaking hands. The shrine of Our Lady of Fatima at Don Bosco, Panaji, was among the first to follow Gracias’ letter, with its in-charge, Fr Loddy Pires, reading out the letter in full on Friday itself. On Sunday, many churches mentioned Gracias’ letter.Meanwhile, Gracias’ advice on the traditional veneration of the cross on Good Friday is also set to be followed in Goa. The superior at Carmelite Monastery, Fr Archibald Gonsalves, said that the traditional kissing of the cross will not be done this year. Gracias, in his letter, had recommended that a blessing with a raised cross be adequate, where those who desire could queue up only to make reverence with a bow and go back.At Don Bosco, Pires too announced that the tradition of kissing of the cross would not be followed at the shrine’s hugely-popular Good Friday service.The new norms are temporary, Gracias said, and will only be valid till Easter.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74544516,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-517599,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-a-precaution-churches-in-goa-keep-stoups-dry-use-sanitisers/articleshow/74543119.cms

It has been years since new roads have been laid in the area.

Although the locality is in core area of the city, residents feel alienated as they find it difficult in getting basic amenities like road, drinking water and proper street lights. Be it the main or inner streets, all of them are in a shambles.

S Alagar, a resident of Nagammal Kovil Street, said that the street is unfit for commute and they have taken up the issue with the authorities concerned. Several months on, officials have not come forward to address it. “We are dependent on private trucks for drinking water and other household needs as we do not get adequate water supply from the corporation. Water level has receded in our borewells with the summer setting in. Water tanker drivers are not pleased to visit our area due to bad roads ,” he said.

Sewage problem is also a perennial issue in the area. Whenever it crops up, the problematic spot is dug up to provide a temporary solution. Many places have been dug to address sewage block, but they are not set right. “Roads were dug up at four places on a single road over the last few months, but they have not been repaired. We find it difficult to commute on it at night, as lighting is also poor. We want all bad roads to be relayed,” Babu, a resident said.

C Chelladurai, another resident, said that they feel alienated in every aspect as they have to travel long distances to avail basic services, like they have to approach Avaniyapuram station to report a crime, while Teppakulam and Keerathurai area stations are nearby.

When contacted, an official from Madurai corporation said that they were aware of the issues in the area and are already working on to address them.

Pollachi forest range officer A Kasilingam said they have been issuing pamphlets to the people to spread awareness on man-made forest fire and how they could help prevent the same.

They have also urged the local people and tourists not to carry matchboxes or easily inflammable goods to the forest area. “They have been asked not to smoke and throw matchstick, cigarette or beedi butts inside the reserve forest. We have also advised the tourists not to stop their vehicle in the forest area and prepare food there,” the officer said.

He said the violators would be booked under the Tamil Nadu Forest Act, the Wildlife Protection Act and the Tamil Nadu Forest Conservation Act. “We have also urged the public to alert us if they notice fire in the forest. It will help us spring into action immediately to douse the fire and curb the extent of damages.”

Kasilingam and the field staff have distributed more than 500 pamphlets to the motorists at Aliyar and Sethumadai check posts on Sunday alone.

The forest range officer said they have set up fireline/firebreak for a stretch of 80km in the Pollachi forest range and deployed 12 temporary fire watchers to curb the incidence of forest fire in the range.

359,['9/03/2020'],Kochi’s youngsters don’t dream of owning a house,"KOCHI: Real estate is failing to catch the fancy of youngsters in the city. This generation is more keen on taking furnished properties on short lease rather than buying apartments or houses in the city. With the trend shifting from saving for the future to living in the present, the young are on the lookout for more freedom and excitement.“The aspirations of youngsters are different from those of the earlier generations. Those in the age group of 20-30 are generally not interested in buying assets and end up paying their hard-earned money on EMIs. They chose to spend on travel or gadgets rather than investing in property,” says Anuj Puri, chairman of Anarock Property Consultants.Interest rates for home loans currently range between 7.90% and 9.75%.It is possible to get well-furnished properties for lease or rent. It also does not force them to remain tied down to one place. Real-estate developers who study the change in attitude of buyers also say that interpersonal relationships between family members are also witnessing a transformation. Sharing of assets and debts during a spilt is confusing, and people do not wish to get themselves entangled in complicated division of assets and liabilities.“Though it is possible to buy a premium or luxury apartment with a bank loan, you end up paying a major part of the salary as EMI. There are really good and well-furnished apartments available for rent in the city and its suburbs. The rent does not come to half of what you pay as EMI. I do not have to worry about quitting a job or job cuts during times of financial crisis. There is ample financial liberty as the money is not locked in,” said Basant Madhavan, an employee with a multinational company. Moreover, he says that when he leaves the city he does not have to worry about upkeep of the property or its disposal. “Once I retire or decide to stop working I can always go back to my ancestral home,” he added.Najeeb Zakaria, managing director of Abad Builders, said that taking into account changes in the attitude of buyers, developers are keen to explore possibilities of providing co-living spaces. Rather than individuals, large companies or multinational corporations can lease spaces in specially designed co-living properties for their employees. “These are not serviced apartments or hostels. But, there are spaces where the individual housing needs of the residents will be met,” he said.

360,['9/03/2020'],Weed bonfire on Holi today to keep away invasive plants from local flora,"Representative image

PUNE: A Weed Bonfire Festival will be organised on Monday evening at Savarkar Smarak to spread awareness about the threat of invasive plant species to local biodiversity on Holi.

Sachin Punekar, founder of biodiversity NGO Biospheres, said the event was in its fourth edition. “We have started an initiative called Weed Bonfire Green Movement. In Pune, this weed bonfire is symbolic and is aimed at addressing the biological invasion. Biological invasion is the biggest threat to biodiversity worldwide. It hinders ecological services and disrupts and destroys the cohesiveness of the ecosystem.”

As to why they chose Savarkar Smarak, he said it was because of its historical relevance. “Swatantraveer Savarkar and his associates had once burnt foreign clothes here to promote the Swadesi movement back then. We will hold the weed bonfire to eradicate invasive alien species and to promote our native biota at the same place.”

He said the basic rationale was to create awareness among the people. “Burning is not the only solution, we will hold workshops as well. We will try and create a dedicated policy to address this biological invasion. Through this particular campaign or movement we will try to promote the right kind of literacy particularly among bureaucrats and politicians.”

There are perennial weeds as well as seasonal weeds. Some thrive in the monsoon while some do so in winters or summers. “We are trying to address all kinds of invasive species including water weeds like the hyacinth as well as agriculture weeds,”he added.

Biospheres is organising the event along with the Pune forest division, the Pune Municipal Corporation ’s environment department and biodiversity management committee and NGOs. Mayor Murlidhar Mohol as well as state agriculture commissioner Suhas Diwase are expected to attend the event.

Shinde was on his way to the inauguration of a hotel and was accompanied by a few people. Their vehicle was driving from Pune towards Bopdeo Ghat, when they spotted the fire on the right side of the Katraj-Satara Road and stopped immediately to have a look.

“We decided to stop and have a quick look at the fire. As we went closer, we realized that it had just started, but was spreading quickly. So we cut some branches of trees nearby and started beating at the fire in a bid to stop it from spreading,” Shinde told TOI on Sunday.

“We identified the contact points and started beating at them with the branches to ensure it didn’t spread further.”

The area was hilly and there was a stiff breeze, which enabled the fire to spread fast.

Shinde and his team realized that they were getting delayed for their event, but persisted in trying to put out the fire as there were two or three jungles nearby. “At one point, we felt our efforts would go to waste, as the fire kept on spreading. It also posed a danger to all of us to an extent, but we persisted and, after 90 minutes of collective effort, we put it out,” he said.

Pictures and video of the entire incident went viral on social media by late Sunday evening. The actor is know for his concern towards the environment and recently undertook several initiatives for tree plantation and conservation across Maharashtra. In the past four years, the actor has planted over three lakh trees in nearly 20 different spots and has also started a non-government organization called Tree-Story Foundation.

The authorities have decided to write to both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman after Holi, seeking their intervention.Officials of the accounts department of Iskcon have desperately been trying to convince the Camac Street branch of the bank to let the religious institution withdraw the money, but to no avail.After the Centre imposed restrictions on withdrawal of cash from Yes Bank, it came to light that around Rs 545 crore of Puri’s Jagannath Temple was stuck in the bank but Tirupati Temple had reportedly withdrawn Rs 13,000 crore from its account. Iskcon Kolkata, too, managed to withdraw a large part of their total deposits over the past one year, but could not take out the last fixed deposit of Rs 2.4 crore.Interest from this Rs 2.4 crore provides for the free meals that Iskcon Kolkata distributes among poor children in schools and other places. A total of 10,000 kids are fed by the institution, funded by this account. The balance was Rs 10 crore around this time last year, spread over two accounts. “The moment we heard talks about trouble brewing at Yes Bank, we decided to take steps before it got late.

PUNE: After a national executive committee last September realised that engineering colleges must teach emerging trends, the All India Council for Technical Education decided to approve BTech in artificial intelligence and data science, from the upcoming academic year.

The council had then told state directorates of technical education to compile and send a list of interested institutes to them by January 31.The date was later extended to March 8.

Assistant director (technical) C T Kunjir said from Pune division, comprising Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli, Pune and Solapur districts, only seven of the 124 colleges had applied for the course till March 5.

“Colleges may not be aware and the course needs expert teachers in the field which may be a problem for many colleges,” he added.

Principals of prominent colleges said one of the reasons many have not applied is because they don't meet the 50% NBA accreditation criteria.

“At least 50% of the courses must be NBA accredited, which is not widespread among the engineering colleges,” said a principal.

A professor of an engineering college said, “At the graduate level, traditional courses make more sense. Students need to build fundamental knowledge of the subject. Emerging courses can be taught as an add-on credit course or as a PG diploma course. Many colleges offer such credit courses and hence the response to AICTE notification is not enthusiastic.”

Additional seats were not being granted for the new BTech programme, but seats have to be adjusted from the current courses which colleges may not find agreeable.

Anil Sahasrabudhe, chairman of the All India Council for Technical Education said, “The deadline was extended to March 8. The final decision on selecting colleges to have these courses will be taken on April 30.”

PUNE: A city-based group of scientists and researchers have taken up the study of temporary rock pool habitats that host a range of ecosystems in the tableland habitats of the Western Ghats .

Research group member Yugandhar Shinde , an assistant professor at the department of zoology, Modern College of Arts, Science and Commerce, said almost 97% water in the world is saline.

“The remaining 2% is under glaciers in the Arctic or the Antarctic. The 1% available as fresh water is from the rivers, ponds, pools and lakes. Of this 1%, about 0.35% water is in temporary habitats or pools which harbours 35% of freshwater diversity,” he said.

Such temporary habitats are not just available in the tropical regions with a lot of rain. “In some cases, it is there in colder climate. Melting snow forms small pools, particularly in grassland areas. In India, we generally look at rainwater pools. Not only animals, but plants are found only in these ephemeral aquatic habitats,” he added.

The flora on the Kas plateau is a kind of ephemeral habitat.

“We find some freshwater habitats, and we get some plants which are not terrestrial, but aquatic. Similarly, there are many animal communities in such habitats with very low nutrients,” he said.

Panchgani is another example of such habitats. “The substrata is mostly rock. The little amount of field or mud has poor nutrients. Fauna has adapted to oligotrophic habitats where nutrients are very low. These habitats harbour unique fauna and that ecosystem or ephemeral water body has a whole community, not just one or two animals. If the habitat is destroyed, you will lose a whole community and not just a single species,” he said.

Independent researcher Mihir Kulkarni said the pools are temporary and can hold water for a week to eight days. “In our ecosystems, we have pools that can hold water from 15 days to four or five months. This makes the habitat unique, when you compare it to other such systems in the world. Although, they are temporary, the duration of them being filled with water is quite different,” he said.

These pools harbour diverse groups of invertebrates.

“They will belong to four or five different groups. Commonly, you could find insect groups, crustaceans and other interesting groups like tardigrades which were released on the moon. All these animals have one thing in common specifically with crustaceans and tardigrades— they are desiccation resistant species. They can resist dry conditions for a considerable amount of time. This adaptation enables them to survive in the pools because they can’t fly away to other habitats like other insects,” he said.

Conserving the habitat would help conserve a particular species because most of them are very small. “If you look at all these different organisms, plants and invertebrates and so on, they are not found in other habitats even on comparable altitudes. It is important to conserve the habitat,” Kulkarni added.

Common threats include mining. “ In the Konkan region, tourism brings rubbish which can destroy the ecosystem. We don’t have a much information about the species which can reveal what we are losing out. Other concerns are climate change because if the rainfall pattern changes, and the animals don’t adapt well and will have to make adjustments to their life cycle. It can wipe out an entire ecosystem. So, habitats and landscapes must be conserved.”

In a bid to prevent possible spread of the novel coronavirus through the breathalyzers, cops have gone back to taking a suspect to the police station and then a hospital for a confirmation of the offence.The change in the drink-driving test procedure did have an effect on the final prosecution figures of the city-wide block raid as only 33 drink driving cases were registered, a fifth of the number during the block raid conducted on the night of February 22. During the block raid conducted in the intervening night of November 30 and December 1 last year, the number of persons prosecuted for drink driving was 103. Traffic cops across the city said there has been no official order about stopping breathalyzer tests, but sources said an unofficial word has been passed down to officers to refrain from using a breathalyzers for the time being.During a drink-drive raid, motorists are randomly picked out and asked to blow through a pipe attached to the breathalyzer that measures the alcohol in his or her blood. But since last Thursday, the traffic guards have been informed to take those showing signs of intoxication to a police station and then to a government hospital for confirmation.“The process is time consuming, but it has been advised to be the norm from now on. We have been asked not to take any chance as coronavirus is extremely contagious and can spread through droplets after a cough or sneeze. Hence, we are trying to prevent exposure through this devices which are used by multiple persons,” said an officer. The officer, however, said the change in procedure did not mean that the crackdown on drunken drivers has come to a halt. “We have been speaking a lot with the suspects to understand if they are intoxicated. In case of any suspicion, we are taking the necessary steps,” the officer said.While the Jorabagan traffic guard topped the arrest list with eight drink-driving prosecutions, a number of traffic guards focussed more on other traffic violations. This led to the sharp decline in number.Of the 1,750 bikers who were prosecuted for offences, 1,116 were not wearing helmets and in 634 were on bikes with three riders each. The cops seized 12 vehicles during the raid. According to police, 134 others were prosecuted for rash driving and another 862 were booked for disorderly conduct.The officers even raided several hideouts of suspects and set up nakas across the city. The drive was supervised by senior officers, like divisional commissioners, assistant commissioners and officers in charge of various police stations and traffic departments.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74544064,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-256673,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/police-intensify-vigil-3k-booked-in-pre-holi-drive/articleshow/74543137.cms
369,['9/03/2020'],"HM, BJP members held for ransacking tailor shop, locking up owner","Coimbatore: A Hindu Munnani ( HM ) functionary and a BJP worker were arrested on Sunday for attacking a tailor shop owner after he refused to down the shutters of his shop on Friday.

The Annur police identified the accused as K Tamilselvan, 24, of Pillaiyappampalayam near Annur, and 43-year-old D Sasikumar, of Kottampatti. While Tamilselvan is Annur south union vice-president of Hindu Munnani, Sasikuamr is a BJP member.

It is to be noted that the Hindu Munnani had called on the shops to down their shutters on March 6 to condemn the attack on its district secretary Anand. However, the protest was later postponed to March 7. Unaware of this, shopkeepers in Annur didn’t open their outlets on March 6.

A police officer said, “When Ananda Krishnan, a Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam member, opened his tailor shop, a group of Hindu Munnani and other Hindu outfit members asked him to down the shutters. When he refused, they ransacked the shop and locked him inside.”

Ananda Krishnan lodged a complaint with the Annur police, who booked Tamilselvan and Sasikuamr under Sections 143 (punishment for unlawful assembly), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement) and 506 (ii) (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and arrested them on Sunday. The two were subsequently lodged in the Coimbatore Central Prison under the judicial custody.

370,['9/03/2020'],Petrol pumps come under pollution board scanner,"KOCHI: It is not just the new petrol pumps that would have to toe the line drawn by the pollution control board as part of making them comply with environment laws.While the fresh guidelines issued by central pollution control board (CPCB), including distance of 50m from residential areas/hospitals/schools, tank specifications and installation of vapour recovery units are directed at new pumps, existing units would have to comply with them sooner or later, Kerala state pollution control board (KSPCB) officials said.“There are a host of issues involving existing units. When it is time for renewal of their licences, we will have to consider all these aspects,” said KSPCB member secretary Sreekala S. A key worry for the board is the increasing cases of groundwater contamination. “Lot of neighbouring wells are facing issues because of contamination from petrol pump tanks and complaints are widespread,” Sreekala said.Kerala state petroleum traders’ association secretary R Sabarinath while welcoming the new guidelines said new norms if implemented properly would help address the issue of groundwater contamination.“I know a dealer who has been supplying potable water to houses nearby for the past two years because of groundwater contamination caused by faulty tanks. In Ernakulam district alone, dealers are supplying water to households in places like Muppathadam, Neriamangalam and Paravur because of issues related to groundwater contamination,” Sabarinath said. According to him, dealers are often not aware about the details when they acquire the dealership from oil marketing companies (OMCs).The national green tribunal had directed oil companies to install vapour recovery systems (VRS) in all petrol pumps as early as October 31, 2018, but this is yet to be implemented. A vapour recovery system helps collect petrol vapour released during unloading and refuelling back to the petrol tanker and underground storage tank.“To my knowledge such systems have not been introduced anywhere in Kerala,” he said, adding that loss due to vaporization is close to one percentage.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74545612,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-56483,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/petrol-pumps-come-under-pollution-board-scanner/articleshow/74542492.cms
371,['9/03/2020'],Goa police loses its appeal before HC in ’06 Batlo case,"Panaji: The Goa police recently lost its appeal in the high court of Bombay at Goa challenging the acquittal of Tariq Ahmad Batlo by a sessions court on charges of waging war against India.

The high court observed that the prosecution had relied on stock panch witnesses and had failed to examine any of the several independent witnesses present at the Margao railway station in March 2006 when Batlo, a Kashmiri, was arrested while allegedly alighting from the Mangala Express with explosives.

Following his arrest, Batlo had been charged under various sections of the Explosive Substances Act, the Arms Act and the Railways Act.

He had pleaded not guilty and had stated that he was not arrested at the Margao railway station on March 10, 2006 as alleged by the prosecution but near Grace Church, Margao, on March 3 that year by the CID police inspector.

Batlo had also stated that after he was illegally detained, it was made to appear that he had been apprehended at the Margao railway station.

He was later acquitted of all charges by a sessions judge, who had held that there was no evidence on record to suggest that Batlo had been travelling on Mangala Express and had been apprehended upon alighting from the train.

While the prosecution told the HC that Batlo was suspected to be involved in crimes by ‘terrorist organisation’ Tehreek-Ul-Mujahiddin, the court held that the dossier (issued by J&K of him being a member of the group) did not constitute evidence by itself.

“…Suspicion, however grave, can never be a substitute for legal proof in such matters,” observed the division bench comprising justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar. “Evidence on record suggests that several persons were available at the railway station, including railways officials. Yet, in the present case, not only were stock panchas called, but these stock panchas were also sought to be passed off as independent witnesses during the course of trial,” the court held.

Batlo was defended by advocate J A Lobo, who was appointed under the legal aid scheme.

It was a narrow escape for the minister who was just a couple of feet away. Officials said soil erosion caused by a leakage in the main sewer line passing under the island on Palam Station Road caused the cave-in.Apart from AIADMK workers, a large number of corporation officials were with the minister during the inspection of the spot where a statue is to come up.The party men who fell into the three-and-a-half-foot-deep hole were lifted to safety. Drenched in filth, they left the place in a hurry even as the minister began addressing the crowd.Corporation officials said the minister was scheduled to inaugurate a community hall built at a cost of Rs 25 lakh and anganwadi buildings constructed at a cost of Rs 17 lakh using his MLA fund. Since the island was on the way, the group decided to inspect the spot where a statue is to be erected under the swachh iconic places initiative.“It was a minor incident, and nobody was injured. It happened due to erosion of soil. There is a pipeline underneath the Island carrying sewage from Sellur to the Munthirithoppu pumping station. The leak was not noticed and it caused the incident,” a higher official from Madurai corporation said adding that they have already begun fixing it.Four traffic Islands - Thiruparankundram, Palanganatham, Sellur and Vilangudi - had been taken up for beautification under the swachh iconic places initiative at a total cost of Rs 60 lakh. While work on two other places is over, those at Sellur and Thiruparankudram have just begun. A peacock structure is coming up at Thiruparankudram, and a structure of kabaddi players is coming up in Sellur to honour the sport which is popular among the youth in Sellur.Structures representing the Thirumalai Nayak Mahal and the Meenakshi Amman Temple car have been erected at Palanganatham and Vilangudi.

At Thrikkakara police sub-division, sedans, suvS and high-end bikes which got tangled in legal troubles have now become ‘unclaimed articles’ and these will soon be auctioned, unless the actual owners turn up with a claim by the end of the month.These vehicles are parked on station premises and AR camps under the Thrikkakara police sub-division.As per the list compiled by the sub-division, there are vehicles from almost all popular brands. “There are vehicles which are abandoned for various reasons, mostly after using them for a crime. Police pick them up and keep them in custody. In other cases, there are vehicles which are seized while police nab someone who have smuggled contraband in them. Some vehicles get stuck with police after they are seized in accident cases,” said a police officer.Police officers took the decision to remove the vehicles after they started to occupy most of the space available on the police station campuses. “It is a waste of money to keep them lying around here. The vehicles — reusable or scrap — need to be auctioned off, if there is no one to claim them. The process itself takes a lot of effort from our personnel. We will remove these vehicles and clean up each and every police campus in the Thrikkakara sub-division,” said Thrikkakara ACP K M Jijimon.According to police, the department is in the initial stage of removing the vehicles as they are now in the process of compiling the number and type of the vehicles. “Now, we have taken the list of vehicles in the possession of each police station under the sub-division. The actual number may be at least 100 more than the primary list that we have prepared as there are vehicles which have turned into complete scrap. Some have even got buried under sand. The process of compiling the list of these vehicles is almost over now,” said an officer.Police, now, are in the process of sending individual intimations to the addresses of the owners to whom the vehicles are registered to. Actual owners will have to raise a claim for the vehicle before March 28, as the police have issued a 30-day public notice on February 27 asking owners to contact them if they have a claim. Unless, they turn up after getting the intimation, the vehicles would soon go under the hammer, police said.Also, officers at police stations said that it would be a relief to get rid of the vehicles. “There are vehicles which are in good condition though many have sustained damages,” said an officer with Panangad police.Some police stations like Ernakulam south station moved the vehicles to sites like the Kalamassery AR camp due to lack of space. Two weeks ago around 17 bikes which were already in a dilapidated state were gutted after fire from bushes near the camp spread to the vehicles.Auctioning procedure of the vehicles will take place as per the directions in Section 56 of the Kerala Police Act which specifies police action in respect of unclaimed articles. Meanwhile, excise department, Ernakulam, has already set a date for auctioning the 15 bikes, one car, one pick-up van and four autos in their possession. This auction would take place at Mamala Excise Range office at 11am on March 19.

KOLKATA: Even after police arrested 29-year-old Adityabh Agarwal from Howrah, who acted as the nodal agent who helped gangs siphon off money from people’s bank accounts by tricking them into parting with their bank details on the pretext of updating their e-wallet KYCs, the racket seemed to thrive in the city. A senior citizen, Kaberi Ganguly, of Keshab Chandra Sen Street, received a call on March 2, when she was told to update her e-wallet KYC. As she was duped into divulging her debit card details, Rs 1.6 lakh was withdrawn from her account, police said.

Investigators have convened a meeting with telecom operators to seek their help. After siphoning off money from their targets, the gangs would disperse the funds at the earliest so that the money trail could not be tracked, police said. “They used an app to send requests to citizens to recharge their mobiles. The money they took for recharge were not paid to telecom companies. The accused sent the money to their own accounts and the money they had stolen were pushed into telecom firms,” said a senior investigator.

The officer said to track the stolen money, they would take telecom operators’ help. “We are creating a mechanism in which, we will get an alert when bulk requests are sent,” said an officer, adding stolen money was mostly funding the recharge industry.

375,['9/03/2020'],Mercury drops as summer begins,"Panaji: While the peak of winter in December and even later part of it had witnessed warm nights, the mercury has remained largely below normal, bringing a chill on a few nights during the first week of summer .

The minimum temperature has hovered between 20 degrees and 22 degrees celsius during March, so far. At least on two occasions, the India meteorological department (IMD), Panaji, recorded a minimum temperature of 20.8C on Saturday and Thursday, nearly two degrees below normal.

The IMD had forecast a slight drop in night temperatures, triggered by western disturbances acting over north-west India, which result in rain and snow fall over Himalayan and adjoining regions.

“The circulations induced over western parts of India bring northerly wind from these cold regions,” Rahul M, scientist, IMD, Panaji, said. This drops minimum temperatures lower than the normal values over Goa.

A circulation over north Karnataka is likely to affect the behaviour of mercury, as the night temperatures will be below the normal range.

While the IMD had also recorded maximum temperatures of over 35C on seven days, making it one of the warmest in a decade, the day temperatures have been within the normal range in March, so far.

The project aims to bring back trees that are mentioned in the Tamil epic Silapathikaram (A tale of two anklets) written by poet Elango Adigal and is the brainchild of SP N Manivannan.

Two years back, Manivannan, who takes interest in Sangam literature, initiated a drive to find if the trees mentioned in the epic still existed. The epic, said to have been written between the fifth and sixth century AD, has described in detail the fauna and flora at the time. The chapter in which the characters of the epic, Kovalan and Kannagi, come to Madurai speaks of a variety of trees and how they react at the arrival of the couple, through the eyes of the poet.

“The park created near the SP’s office two years ago is today a flourishing grove of trees and many enjoy it. It is also a learning experience as we were able to learn from him about these trees and took up the mission of planting these trees throughout Madurai,” said Pon Kumar, convener of Pasumai Nanbargal, an organisation working to improve the green cover in Madurai.

“The minister who planted the first tree, has assured us that this park would be designed and maintained with the help of the Madurai corporation,” said M Pushparaj, secretary Duraisamy Nagar Residents Welfare Association, adding that the park was being developed on a half-acre land in their residential complex. The engineering department of the corporation will lay out a walkway in the park, following which 35 saplings will be planted.

“Holistic education and compassion for fellow beings is what provide our students with,’’ said N Thilagam, headmistress of Cheran Vidayalaya Matric higher secondary school in Chinnalapatti. On Saturday, the students of the school accompanied by the teachers visited the female weavers at their workplace and offered them sweets and gifts.

Thilagam said that this was an effort to make the students realise the importance of women, and the amount of hard work they put in for their families. “These ladies are makers of beautifully designed sarees and a lot of effort goes into it. When they are appreciated, it makes them happy,’’ said Thilagam.

These women seldom receive any recognition for all their hard work in making these sarees, said another teacher. She said that the school has been recognising women in many fields for the past three years on Women’s day .Tenth standard students T S Rashmi, K Yogeswari and K Pooja said that even though they knew a thing or two about weaving, they were not aware that it was such a difficult task.

“We saw them dipping the cloth in boiling water and then hanging it to dry,’’ they said. The weavers said that they had heard about Women’s day but that this was for the first time, that they received sweets and gifts on the occasion.

KOLKATA: With Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation scheduled to go to the polls later this year, the civic body is taking extra efforts to collect property tax dues from the Rajarhat jurisdiction area that has run into several crores of rupees. Civic assessment department officials will from next week visit every ward and hold camps inside housing complexes in Rajarhat to collect property tax and sort out mutation-related problems.

A Bidhannagar civic body official said the authorities had set itself a target to mop up Rs 100 crore from property tax by October, before this civic body’s tenure completes. “Most people living in Rajarhat area wants to pay tax, but many of them are confused about how to calculate the amount. Our officials will visit every ward and hold camps in housing complexes in Baguiati, Kaikhali, Raghunathpur and other places, where residents can clear their confusion,” said an assessment department official of Bidhannagar municipal corporation. Sources said the central valuation board had been engaged to come up with a revised property tax structure for about 30 wards of Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation that fell in Rajarhat and areas adjacent to Salt Lake.

Civic officials pointed out that collection of the tax had been quite regular from residents of Salt Lake, but crores of rupees had been due from property owners living in the civic body’s Rajarhat jurisdiction. “When Bidhannagar Municipality was upgraded to a municipal corporation in 2015, a vast area on the two sides of VIP Road till airport, which previously fell under the erstwhile Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality, was included in Bidhannagar. But there has been some problems in synchronising the area’s property tax collection with that of Salt Lake. This is largely due to disputes relating to issues, like building plan sanction and mutation, with complaints pouring in about several buildings being constructed illegally in the previous Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality area,” a civic official said.

A Bidhannagar Municipality official said that the civic body had started collecting property tax from households in Rajarhat only since the past couple of years, after the authorities came up with a tax regimen for the belt. The tax amount collected on a quarterly basis had been very low and several years of dues had not been paid yet, the official said.

In Salt Lake, the civic body regularly sends tax bills to residents every quarter, based on the old tax structure of the pre-1995 rate. “A revised tax structure is required to increase revenues,” an official said.

380,['9/03/2020'],"Ex-mantris, MLAs of NC, PDP &amp; Cong form J&amp;K party ‘to move on from 370 mourning’","SRINAAGR/NEW DELHI: Splinter groups from People’s Democratic Party (PDP), National Conference (NC) and Congress came together on Sunday to announce formation of a new political outfit, Apni Party , to provide an alternative to “family-owned” parties and move on, as some said, beyond “perpetually mourning” over abrogation of Article 370.

As reported by TOI on February 24, at least two dozen members of J&K Apni Party are ex-MLAs and former ministers of PDP, NC and Congress led by ex-finance minister of J&K and sacked PDP member Altaf Bukhari . The new formation draws its strength from scores of district-level functionaries across Kashmir drawn from the three main parties that governed the erstwhile state for several decades.

J&K’s special status was removed on August 5 last year and the state was turned into a Union Territory with a legislature. PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference’s Farooq Abdullah and son Omar, all former CMs, were in detention since August 5 and have now been arrested under the stringent Public Safety Act.

Incarceration of the top leadership of PDP and NC is seen by many as the chief reason behind largescale defections in the two parties.

Congress called the new outfit an offshoot of BJP, intended to create “chaos and divisions” in J&K. “People have witnessed the offshoot of the saffron party in the political system of J&K and fully realise what is going on behind the curtains,” J&K Pradesh Congress Committee president G A Mir said in a statement.

NC and PDP described Apni Party as the “B-team of BJP” and said it was now becoming clear that detention of the top leadership of the two parties had nothing to do with law and order but was purely political.

“The way things are unfolding in J&K, it is pretty clear that the central government, in connivance with a few, are contriving to prop up yet another formation in J&K to serve its interests,” NC said. PDP state secretary Abdul Hameed Kousheen said while three former CMs were under detention, Bukhari and a few others were free to carry out their political activities.

Bukhari, appointed president of Apni Party, sidestepped criticism and blamed the leadership of PDP, Congress and NC for the developments. “We were waiting for the last seven months hoping that they will come out and raise issues and problems faced by the people. But as most leaders who were under detention have been released, they preferred to keep mum instead of raising those issues,” he said. He demanded that those in detention under PSA should be released.

Others who joined the new outfit include Usman Majid, a former minister and ex-MLA of Congress from Bandipora, PDP founding member Ghulam Hassan Mir , former PDP general secretary Dilawar Mir and former chief secretary and ex-NC MLC Vijay Bakaya among several former ministers and MLAs.

BJP's Kashmir unit welcomed the launch of Apni Party and said, “People were fed up with family politics in the Valley and now they want to see a vibrant change.” The party said it would work with the new outfit “for the development of the region”.

A 42-year-old blind teacher at a government school was arrested by the Perur all women police on Saturday under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 for sexually harassing a 12-year-old blind student. In February, a government school teacher in Annur was arrested for sexually harassing a 12-year-old girl student. The headmaster of a panchayat union primary school in Negamam was also arrested in February for sexually harassing girl students.

Psychologists cited surveys to show that the state fared badly in tackling the issue. S Arul Vadivu, a psychologist with the school education department, said they have been talking to teachers about sexual harassment cases and its consequences during training sessions. “There has to be district-level counselling sessions for teachers in the beginning of the academic year,” she said.

Along with male teachers, their spouses should be given counselling, said G P Godhanavalli, student and family counsellor. “Their marital problems could also be a reason for the issue. That should also be dealt with,” she said. “Counselling sessions should be offered to both teachers and students in government, corporation and private schools. Such incidents happen regardless of the type of school but in some instances, they don’t get reported.”

Personal accountability is lacking in the school education department, said Saras Bhaskar, a counselling psychologist. “A teacher accused of sexual harassment is just transferred to another place. Rather, the school education department should adopt a zero-tolerance policy and make teachers sign an agreement during recruitment that in case of such an accusation, they would be dismissed and also blacklisted,” she said.

“Awareness sessions would help, but unless there are strict policies regarding sexual harassment and also penalty on school authorities for non-implementation, there wouldn’t be a real impact,” Bhaskar said. “There should also be provisions to strictly deal with false complaints,” added Bhaskar.

382,['9/03/2020'],Underground parking proposed near old Aatish Market in Jaipur,"JAIPUR: To decongest the Walled City area, an underground parking has been proposed near the old Aatish market. The project will accommodate 400 vehicles, including 250 cars. According to officials, the multi-crore project will be constructed and funded by Jaipur Smart City Limited (JSCL) and executed by the Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC). An official at JMC said, “The detailed project report (DPR) of the parking has been prepared. The estimated cost for construction is Rs 15 crore. The project will be completed in two years, once commissioned.”

The technical bid for the project will be opened on April 16. “The decision to construct the parking was taken nearly five months ago. Following which DPR was prepared,” an official said.

As parking has become a perennial problem in the Walled City areas, civic agencies are trying to make the area vehicle-free. A senior official said, the Ramniwas Bagh underground parking extension, however, might not be included in the Smart City projects list.

An official at UDH said, “The JSCL has proposed to develop parking spaces near the Walled City. For this, Rs 90 crore has been proposed. It was requested to include Ramniwas Bagh parking and involve JDA for construction. However, the proposal was turned down,” the official said.

The JDA is planning to extend underground parking at Ramniwas Bagh to resolve the issue of vehicular congestion in Walled City.

As per the proposal, approximately 700 vehicles can be parked after extending the existing parking. An official source said, “The underground parking is proposed to be constructed on a strip of land situated between the existing parking and Mahila Chikitsalaya. Its length and width would be 584 metre by 26 metre. Once constructed, the parking space can house 1,615 vehicles. The estimated cost of the project is Rs 153 crore, if the JDA got the financial support, the project would have been completed without hindrance,” the official said.

JAIPUR: To fill the coffers of the cash-strapped state government, the urban development and housing (UDH) department is mulling a proposal to regulate unauthorised budget hotels operational in the residential areas of the city.

The long-pending demand of the hoteliers was put forward by the state UDH department in a meeting called by the chief minister’s advisor to boost revenue. The department had given a presentation to regulate these unauthorised budget hotels.

A senior official at the town planning wing said, “As Rajasthan is a tourist state and these hotels are a major source of economic activity, the department will formulate a policy to regulate these units. Mandatory provisions of fire safety and policy will be incorporated in the policy.”

Over the years, these hotels have illegally flourished near the bus stand area, railway station and many residential areas of the city. The state is eyeing to earn Rs 1,000 crore revenue after regulating these budget hotels. As per the department officials, there are over 2,000 budget hotels operational in the state, including 525 in the state capital alone.

Many fear the state government might get stumped as high court has banned commercial activity in residential areas and directed the state government to adhere to the masterplan. However, the UDH department official said, “The government can always regulate these establishments after bringing the policy. The policy will be framed following the high court directions.”

Sources said the department might also bring in policy to regulate nearly 450 hospitals in the state capital and coaching institutes to earn revenue.

Other than this, the UDH is also contemplating to impose impact fee on illegal buildings to discourage the rampant practice in cities. After the decision was taken in the building bylaws expert committee, the department is preparing a draft proposal. Once the concept is introduced, owners of commercial properties that violate the building bylaws will have to pay penalty every year. But for residential properties, a one-time impact fee will be imposed.

An official said, “The proposal has been given approval by the expert committee. The rates will be fixed after receiving a nod from the UDH minister.”

The train was run by T J Gerothy, a loco pilot with 22 years of experience in Indian railways. She was assisted by Vidya Das, assistant loco pilot, in the cabin. “I worked as assistant loco pilot for around 10 years before getting promoted as loco pilot. Currently I am running passenger train and occasionally operate mail and express trains. I am happy to be part of this initiative on Women’s Day,” said Gerothy, who is from Varapuzha.

The chief ticket examiner was P B Geethakumari, who has 32 years of experience as TTE. “Though I have been in the field for the past 32 years, being part of an all-women crew in Venad Express is a surprise for me,” she said, while waiting to board the train.

390,['9/03/2020'],Portrait of an artist as a technophile,"Austin Konchira at his art exhibition at Durbar Hall Art Gallery

KOCHI: We live in an age when a wave of neo-luddism, philosophy of technological opposition, riding the growing fears of automation, is sweeping across the world .

But Austin Konchira will have none of it. The aesthetic experience of machines in the works of Austin is a vision cobbled together by disembowelled nuts and bolts, sockets and fulcrums in a state of perpetual motion. His canvases reveal a kinetics of chaos that can immerse you in a world where desire meets death. The metallic music that emanates from his art is that of the industrial junkyard and the factory assembly line: thrum and rumble, drone and scrunch.

For many modernists, fear of technology and horrors of the modern age that gave us two world wars and ideologies like fascism were traumatic. For Konchira too, it was a similar experience. His earlier works had hellish landscapes and deformed human beings crying out in pain.

Konchira says machines and discarded mechanical objects began to appear in his paintings as far as 20 years ago. “When I used to do surrealistic works I used machine forms to fill the space. They were supportive elements to the main theme. Recently I began to think why not use them as the main theme,” he said.

“Men invented machines but they had a growth of its own. I believe that a modern man cannot fulfil his desires without machines. Many criticize them but there is no escape from them,” says Konchira, who taught history for 20 years in various colleges across the state. “In Indian art scene, you cannot see an artist who praise machines, they were all against it,” he said.

“But it’s true that some aspects of machines are hideous like the aircrafts in the world war,” says Konchira, who holds a postgraduate degree in history from University College, Thiruvananthapuram. “I am worried when we misuse technology and machines,” he said.

A dropout from the College of Fine Arts in Thiruvananthapuram, Konchira calls himself a self-taught artist.

“I always consider my art as a performance to heal my existence. It is a long journey to reach some unknown destination and I know that one can never reach there till his life is spent,” writes Konchira in a note introducing his work. A seeker, Konchira’s art has traversed several styles from naturalism to romanticism and surrealism and abstraction. A journey he continues to undertake in search of new images, forms and colours.

An art exhibition by Konchira is on at the Durbar Hall Art Gallery. The exhibition will conclude on Wednesday.

JAIPUR: Two people were critically burnt and two others injured when their vehicle was set ablaze by around six attackers in Bikaner’s Nokha area on Sunday evening. The crime took place barely 150m from the police station and is suspected to be the fallout of a gang rivalry.

“The four victims were sitting in their vehicle and having tea when around 4.30pm, the attackers poured petrol on the vehicle and set it afire. Two passengers suffered more than 70% burns and are under treatment at a Bikaner hospital. The other two got away with minor burn injuries,” Bikaner SP Pradeep Mohan Sharma said. Sources said the critically burnt are unlikely to survive as their injuries are very grave.

“The victims and accused were members of rival gangs and both groups had a long criminal history. Around six months ago, the victims had attacked the accused. Sunday’s attack was apparently an act of revenge. A case of attempt to murder has been registered against the accused. We are investigating the matter and looking for them,” SP Sharma said.

Even as cops claimed the accused are yet to be arrested, sources said around six people have been detained in connection with the crime and their vehicle seized. The attack took place in a lane parallel to the Nokha police station while a Community Liaison Group meeting was being held there.

396,['9/03/2020'],Hope rises as MSME units get more orders,"Coimbatore: With the financial year coming to an end, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the district are receiving more orders.

This could be due to the necessity of industries to achieve the year-end target, representatives of MSME associations said. They hope to tide over the slump of the previous fiscal if the trend continues for the next quarters.

Job orders in sectors such as textile machines and pumpsets have seen an increase, said C Sivakumar of the Coimbatore Tirupur District Micro and Cottage Entrepreneurs Association (Cotma). “While it is not as much as we used to get earlier, it is better compared to the last year,” he said. “There is a 60% increase in the orders compared to the last year.”

District president of the Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises (TACT) J James agreed. “Compared to almost no orders in the beginning of this year, over the last one week, there has been 40% increase in orders. While usually orders for pump jobwork begin in December, this year, it has started to pick up,” he said.

Industrialists hope that the trend will sustain post April, which would mean that they will have a favourable year. “Units have started to get orders. But, we suspect it to be due to the year-end targets. We have to wait for two more months to get a clear picture. Only after April we can say whether the upward trend would sustain,” said state vice-president of Laghu Udyog Bharati S Surulivel.

While some reports said that due to the coronavirus impact on the Chinese industry, Indian engineering industry stands to gain, a section of industrialists were sceptical. “We cannot deliver for prices as competitive as China,” said Surulivel.

397,['9/03/2020'],Avoid panic-buying sanitisers in bulk: City pharmacists,"Madurai: With the first COVID-19 case reported in Tamil Nadu at Chennai on Saturday, public and health officials are on alert across the state for possible spread of infection.

In light of the COVID-19 breakout in India, many pharmacies and departmental stores in the city said that the sale of hand sanitizers and hand wash solutions has shown a distinctive rise during the past month. Pharmacists are now urging the public to not panic-buy such items in bulk which could lead to a shortage.

The most effective way to prevent the spread of any viral infection, including COVID-19, is practising hand hygiene and cough etiquette. “It was surprising for us because hardly 10% of people in the city buy sanitizers and hand wash solutions. But, during the past month, there has been an increase in sales. Cheaper brands are getting sold out quickly and many individuals are even buying it in bulk as well,” said a pharmacist from Kamarajar Salai. The pharmacist added that they have had to get more orders for sanitizers from different brands to keep up.

“Certainly there has been an increase in sales and we found some people buying even 500 ml containers which were mostly left unsold before. There is no threat of shortage yet but definitely demand has increased,” said a salesperson at a departmental store in Anna Nagar. Apart from sanitizers, pharmacists said that retail sales of masks had shown a marginal increase too.

“It is better to be safe than sorry. We had not paid much attention to getting sanitizers before but it would be foolish now to ignore precautions. We have young children at home too,” said Shanti A, resident of KK Nagar.

Meanwhile, the Tamil Nadu Chemists and Druggists Association general secretary, KK Selvan urged the public to remain vigilant but not buy sanitizers or masks in bulk. “Manufacturers are unable to match the orders required, as there is a sudden demand and it is not possible to import too. So, the public should exercise good judgment and take precautions as and when necessary instead of stocking up. Irresponsibly buying it in bulk can cause a shortage and those who really need it will suffer,” he said.

398,['9/03/2020'],"Loan waiver: TRS junks DBT, will hand over cheques","Finance minister T Harish Rao announced that local MLAs will distribute the cheques to the eligible farmers.

HYDERABAD: The TRS government, which had promised a farmer friendly approach, made major announcements regarding the loan waiver scheme. Instead of distributing the loan waiver amount through direct benefit transfer (DBT), the government will now distribute cheques to the farmers. All outstanding loans up to Rs 25,000 will be waived off in a stretch with the release of Rs 1,198 crore.

Finance minister T Harish Rao announced that local MLAs will distribute the cheques to the eligible farmers. This shows that the TRS regime is keen on reaping political benefits by making direct contact with the farmers, unlike the DBT. A total of 5,83,916 farmers have outstanding loans below Rs 25,000. It is estimated that the state would need Rs 24,738 crore for this scheme as against Rs 16,124 crore when it implemented it in the first cycle between 2015 and 2018.

The state has allocated Rs 6,225 crore this year for the scheme. Rao later said that all outstanding loans of above Rs 25,000 to Rs 1 lakh will be waived in four instalments. It may be noted that the allotment for loan waiver last year was Rs 6,000 crore, but did not spend single rupee on the scheme.

Over the past week, the government health authorities and private hospital administrations had held several meetings. In a meeting called by the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) on Wednesday, mayor Nandkumar Ghodele, municipal health officer Nita Padalkar, deputy director of health services Swapnil Lale, district civil surgeon Sundar Kulkarni, head of GMCH’s medicine department Meenakshi Bhattacharya, World Health Organisation’s consultant doctor Shaikh Mujeeb and Indian Medical Association ’s Kuldeepsing Raul and Satyanarayan participated.

It was decided that the responsibility of preliminary screening and diagnosis of Covid-19 lies with the district civil hospital, while training and tertiary care management is the GMCH’s responsibility.

The GMCH has, subsequently, dedicated its two-floor CVTS building for setting up of a coronavirus tertiary care management centre. According to GMCH medical superintendent Suresh Harbade, “The guidelines state that there should be an isolated compartment for each patient with oxygen support. We are raising compartments for isolation of each bed.”

The GMCH has maintained that no suspected or positive coronavirus patient has been identified in Aurangabad so far. However, the centre is being developed in case an emergency arises, the hospital said.

The cath lab at the CVTS building went out of function around 2 years ago. Since then, the hospital had stopped performing heart-related surgeries and diagnostic procedures. Harbade said the staff of the CVTS building will be equipped to manage the coronavirus cases. “The GMCH has started the training of its doctors, nurses and class IV staff for the management of Covid-19. If municipal or district health authorities approach us, we can train their staff too,” he said.

The hospital has called for masks (N-95) from the district public health department and the Directorate for Medical Education and Research (DMER). The hospital will be using its HIV personal protective equipment (PPE) for coronavirus management.

JAIPUR/JAISALMER: Ministers in charge of the hailstorm-affected districts took stock of the crop damage on Sunday and said that every affected farmer will be compensated adequately based on the girdawari (crop assessment) report. They also directed the officials not to deprive any farmer of crop-damage assessment.

B D Kalla, minister in charge of Jaisalmer and Barmer districts, directed the officials that a special girdawari report for areas with more than 33% damage must be submitted by March 16 so that relief can be provided. Kalla also said that farmers who suffered more than 33% damage will be provided compensation through Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana and those farmers who are not covered under it will be provided assistance from the Natural Disaster Fund.

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot had instructed them to assess the damage in 18 of 33 districts in the state.

“The state government is standing by farmers. Compensation will be given to affected farmers. Assessment is being conducted by officials in all affected districts,” said agriculture minister Lalchand Kataria, who visited the affected areas in Jaipur. Minister in charge of Jaipur, Shanti Dhariwal, after taking stock of crop losses in the villages of Sirsi region in Jaipur said wheat crop has been badly damaged due to hailstorm in the district and vegetables have been destroyed completely in some places. “The complete assessment of the damage caused by hailstorm can be established only after the completion of girdawari report. So far, girdawari has been done in 90% of the affected areas. Not a single farmer should be deprived of crop damage assessment by the officials,” he said.

“In Jaipur, crop damage has been between 50 and 70%. In some cases, the damage is 100% (cash crop including vegetables and tomatoes),” he added.

Pratap Singh Khachariyawas, Bundi in charge, also instructed the officials to submit the girdawari ssoon. Govind Singh Dotasra , minister in charge of Ganganagar also echoed similar sentiments after assessing the damage.

He said that the DSE was in the process of similarly preparing activity-based learning material for the primary school students as well.The core premise of activity-based learning is that learning should be based on doing hands-on experiments and activities.The idea of activity-based learning is rooted in the common notion that children are active learners rather than passive recipients of information. If the child is provided the opportunity to explore on their own and provided an optimum learning environment, then the learning becomes joyful and long-lasting.Sr Olivia Oliveira, who is a specialist in kindergarten education and under whose guidance the workbook for pre-primary students was prepared, said that the workbook contains activities which help the child to develop and keep them steady in their writing skills.The book will help children solve and learn even more difficult cognitive tasks.

Poultry farmers say they have been dealt a severe blow because of the coronavirus scare and seek the government to take measures to prevent fear mongering before sales could drop further because of avian flu.“If the government does not take any action to create awareness that chicken is not a health threat, poultry farmers will be in deep trouble. We have no choice but to let chicks out from farms,’’ said Vangili Subramanian, president of Tamil Nadu Egg Marketing Society and a pioneer in poultry sector in Namakkal.Namakkal has hundreds of poultry farms which on any given day have 20 crore chicks. These are exported to various countries besides catering to domestic supply across the country. Kerala is a key buyer.Subramanian said there was no way bird flu could spread from Kerala to farms in Tamil Nadu. “But the fear can affect consumption,’’ he said. While Namakkal poultry farmers can fall back on other markets, those in Coimbatore and Tirupur say they would be severely affected if fear of avian flu spreads. “There are close to 5,000 farms in Coimbatore and Tirupur concentrated in places like Dharapuram, Udumalpet, Madathukulam and Annur. More than 80% of our chicken is sent to Kerala,’’ president of Coimbatore district broiler merchants association M Kandasamy said.He said 20 lakh to 30 lakh kg of chicken was sent to Kerala every week. Reiterating the view of Subramaniam, Kandasamy also said that the farms here would not be affected by bird flu outbreak in Kerala.

JAIPUR: Rajasthan BJP has challenged the BSP MLAs joining Congress while submitting a petition before assembly speaker CP Joshi in the assembly. BJP objected to the joining by calling it unconstitutional and demanded disqualification of the BSP MLAs.

The petition reads, “It is the party which has to take a call on the merger or forming an alliance, not its MLAs.” BJP MLA Madan Dilawar had told the speaker that the way the MLAs joined Congress calls for an inquiry. “This has violated the electoral system of the country. I urge the speaker to investigate the matter legally and find out the motives behind joining,” said Dilawar, who handed over the petation along with some BJP MLAS. Reacting to the move, Joshi said, “I have received a formal petition from the BJP, law will take its own course.” Six BSP MLAs - Rajendra Singh Gudha , Jogendra Singh Awana, Wajib Ali, Lakhan Singh Meena , Sandeep Yadav and Deepchand - had joined the ruling Congress in September 2019.

The mnove was scripted by chief minister Ashok Gehlot after several rounds of negotiations with the MLAs while keeping the BSP chief Mayawati in the dark. BJP has been raising objection since the MLAs joined Congress. Sources said that if BJP failed to get a proper response from the speaker, they will take the matter to the court. tnn

404,['9/03/2020'],Tamil Nadu: DMK in no hurry to choose new general secretary,"K Anbazhagan

CHENNAI: Following the demise of K Anbazhagan , who was the DMK’s general secretary for 43 years, the party has to now choose a successor to the post. But the DMK may not be in a hurry to choose its next general secretary, multiple sources in the DMK said.

Anbazhagan became the party’s general secretary in 1977, after V R Nedunchezhiyan, who was holding that post, resigned. Since then, M Karunanidhi and Anbazhagan have remained the only contenders for the posts of president and general secretary in the DMK’s intra party elections.

As the senior-most leader, DMK treasurer S Durai Murugan may be the natural choice. With organisational polls now under way and the formal election of DMK president and general secretary being the last step in the process, it is likely to take time, pointed out senior leaders.

After the death of Karunanidhi, M K Stalin was chosen as the president by the party’s general council. Despite Anbazhagan’s failing health due to age-related complications, Stalin had decided that the latter will remain the general secretary until his end.

“Actually, there is no hurry for choosing a new general secretary. As per our party bylaws, in the absence of the general secretary, the party president can discharge all the duties,” DMK Rajya Sabha MP and party spokesman T K S Elangovan told TOI. At the DMK’s last general council meeting held in November, 2019, the council vested Stalin with additional discretionary powers.

“Further, the general secretary is an elected post. Members of the party’s general council will elect a person for the post. For that, a meeting of the party’s general council has to be convened,” Elangovan added.

Besides the week long mourning period, the DMK’s organisational elections too have already begun. The process has now been suspended for a week due to Anbazhagan’s death.

“What has begun is only the party’s preliminary election process, which will end in April. Elections to the posts of party president and general secretary will take place only towards the end and that may happen only after the assembly elections,” said DMK Rajya Sabha MP R S Bharathi.

While the assembly election is more than a year away, anything could happen in politics. “It is the prerogative of the party president and the person that he chooses will become the general secretary. As such, there would not be much competition,” said a DMK source.

“In the past, it was the party’s treasurers, who went on to become the general secretaries, including in the case of Anbazhagan. Hence, the party’s present treasurer Durai Murugan may be the obvious choice, as and when it happens,” DMK sources said. When that happens, the DMK may have to choose a new treasurer too.

406,['9/03/2020'],Drones may soon monitor Tamil Nadu jails,"Representative Image

CHENNAI: Soon, the campuses of central prisons in Tamil Nadu would be under close scrutiny as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will help step up surveillance. Officials say this would be the first time that prisons in the country would be using drones for surveillance.

There are nine central prisons for men and four special prisons for women, with more than 13,000 remanded and convicted prisoners. While three of the prisons in Vellore, Trichy and Coimbatore are spread over 100 acres, the remaining are spread over 20 to 45 acres. With shortage of manpower, it is a daunting task to keep a close watch on convicts, particularly those locked up in high-risk cells. This has prompted the prison department to step up surveillance by installing jammers to X-ray machines, checking smuggling of contrabands and ensuring that convicts don’t get access to cellphones.

TN had announced in the Budget session that Rs 21.85 lakh would be allocated for procuring drones to monitor prisons effectively. “In the first phase, the department plans to procure nine drones, each at a cost of Rs 2.25 lakh,” said an official, seeking anonymity.

While the department has invited tenders to procure the UAVs, senior officials have sought the assistance of the police department’s technical wing to purchase drones that suit the prison department’s need. “We will procure UAVs with specifications similar to those of the police department,” he added. The closed-circuit television cameras in the prisons have become defunct. In such a scenario, it would be a daunting task to keep a close watch over the prison campus and act immediately in situations like a riot.

The drones would be used to prevent smuggling of contraband into the prison.

AURANGABAD: The civic body did not have any discussion with the agency, which was shortlisted for the Harsul waste management plant tender, on whether the bidder is ready to accept the modified terms of the tender set by the standing committee on February 13.

The tender for the installation, operation and maintenance of the plant to treat 150 tonnes of waste per day (TPD) worth Rs 16.76 crore was placed before the standing committee. On February 13, committee chairperson Jaishri Kulkarni , gave a ruling that the tender cannot be approved in full. Kulkarni said that the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation could only procure the machines required from the agency, but the operation and maintenance of the plant has to be done by the AMC . The committee approved Rs 4.57 crore of the total tender cost.

In September 2019, the committee questioning the efficiency of the agency, asked the AMC to carry out the re-tendering process. However, Shiv Sena brought the tender before the committee again in January asking it to reconsider the old tender. According to deputy mayor Rajendra Janjal , who is also a standing committee member, re-tendering would increase the costs of the project by at least 10 to 15%.

“While we welcome a resolution in Telangana assembly against NPR, NRC and CAA , this alone is not enough to stop the NPR work in the state. Clear-cut directions in the form of a GO should be given to the officials to stop all NPR-related work as has been done by few other states,” the letter said.

He also attached a copy of the GO issued by the Government of Kerala which read: “Considering the apprehensions among the general public that the conduct of NPR-related activities lead to NRC, the state government must order a stay on all the activities related to the updation of NPR in the state forthwith.”

Uttam said that the Congress will lend full support to the resolution against CAA, NPR and NRC in the Telangana assembly. “A GO staying NPR work will send a strong message that Telangana, home to a diverse population, stands firmly opposed to the communal agenda of the BJP-led central government,” he said.

Stating that the NPR is the first step towards implementing a nation-wide NRC, he said that data from the NPR would be used to instill fear against targeted sections of society. “The problem is not necessarily with the NPR itself but the blatant communal intentions of the BJP that is implementing it,” he said.

He said that it is important for the state government to take a documented and definitive stand against CAA, NPR and NRC. “We believe that a resolution to be passed in the state assembly is a step in the right direction, but not an adequate response to the threat of communalisation,” Uttam said.

409,['9/03/2020'],"Telangana budget: From Rs 1k crore last year, 2-bhk project funds hiked to Rs 11.9k cr","Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao

HYDERABAD: After having drawn severe criticism for not releasing adequate funds to the two-bed room housing project for the homeless poor in the past six years, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao-led TRS government has allocated Rs 11,917 crore to the housing department in the budget for 2020-2021 fiscal.

The government had allocated a meagre Rs 1,005 crore in 2019-20 budget for the project.

With this huge allocation in 2020-21 budget, the good news for homeless poor is that their six-year long wait and dream of becoming owners of “dignified housing” in the form of 2-bhk units — an election promise made by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao in 2014 poll campaign — has shown signs of materialising.

Over one lakh houses in and around GHMC area alone are likely to be completed before elections to the civic body. Polls to GHMC are likely to be held by year end or early 2021.

Currently, construction on majority of the total sanctioned 2.72 lakh 2-bhk housing units is nearing completion in the state. Contractors had stopped work at several places over non-payment of bills. The project requires over Rs 9,000 crore to be completed.

CM KCR had dropped indications of TRS government being committed to fulfil its poll promise of providing “2-bhk dignified housing” to the homeless poor in the state assembly on Saturday itself.

Stating that the TRS government promises only those things, which it can fulfil and that 2-BHK project was one among them, KCR had said the party has been delivering every promise made by it to the people of Telangana in its election manifesto. “The 2020-2021 budgetary allocations will make this amply clear even in case of 2-BHK project,” he said in the assembly on Saturday, while replying to Congress members allegations on TRS-government’s failure to complete the much-delayed housing project.

The KCR-led TRS government has decided to fulfil its promise made in 2018 assembly elections manifesto of giving Rs 5 lakh each one lakh eligible families owning lands to construct 2-bhk houses.

This promise was made by TRS as the government was finding it difficult to get suitable land to expand the beneficiary list for 2-BHK housing project.

Those who have own lands but do not have pucca houses and are eligible for 2-BHK units, will be given Rs 5 lakh each in 2020-21 financial year.

HYDERABAD: Only Rs 750 crore have been allocated for development as well as maintenance of highways in Telangana .

There was no mention of budgetary allocation to take up works on regional ring road, which is estimated to cost over Rs 13,000 crore. Though Rs 550 crore were allocated for completion of integrated collectorate complexes, district police offices and police command control centres, a raw deal has been meted out to the roads and buildings department.

The R&B now needs to obtain loans to not only take up development of highways but also for maintenance as the allocation is meagre. The government has allocated Rs 1,000 crore to TSRTC in the budget. Though the accumulated losses of TSRTC are over 5,000 crore, this allocated Rs1,000 crore will provide partial relief to the RTC.

The chief minister has also promised cargo business from government departments to TSRTC to raise its revenue. In all, the transport, roads and buildings department got an allocation of Rs 3,494 crore, of which over Rs 1,000 crore would go towards salaries alone. The development and expansion of national highways, state and district roads is all set to slow down in Telangana in the current financial year due to lack of financial support.

JAIPUR: Jaipur Rural police on Sunday arrested one person in Jamwa Ramgarh for growing ‘ poppy ’ ( papaver somniferum ) and seized 73,642 plants of the same. The accused was growing opium in the middle of his wheat field for the past couple of years.

The accused, 40-year-old Bansi Lal, was growing poppy in two areas of his field. “We received information that the accused was illegally growing poppy and constituted a team to nab him. A 29-member team raided his field and found that poppy plants were being grown at two spots. During questioning, the accused confessed that he had been growing poppy for over two years,” a police official said.

According to officials, the accused admitted that he was addicted to doda-post and had planned on selling the poppy at a high price in the market. The seized poppy plants weighed 610kg.

412,['9/03/2020'],Pune: Stand-up comics tickle the funny bone while ghazals serenade many,"PUNE: It was a full house on Sunday at the Amstrad Times Celebrate Pune festival with sounds of laughter, hooting and whistles buzzing around the arena.

The women of the Bharatiya Digital Party, aka ‘Bhadipa’, engaged the crowd completely on the second day of the festival.

The Balgandharva Rangmandir was bustling with a predominantly young audience, majority of whom were fans of the many acts and actors, especially the irrepressible “Bhadipachi Aai” (Renuka Daftardar) and the plain-speaking Savita Prabhune, alias “Kadam Kaku”.

However, the young brigade of women stand-up comics Sayali, Trupti, Madhura, Savani and Neha were not too far behind in garnering applause. They were contemporary, uninhabited, and unapologetic. They enjoyed interacting with the audience and were quick on the repartee. But the show-stoppers were indeed “Bhadipachi Aai” and “Kadam Kaku”.

The festival is powered by Phoenix Marketcity , co-sponsored by Sankla Buildcoon and the Pune Municipal Corporation is a partner.

The music launch of actor-director Mahesh Manjrekar’s film, ‘Pangharun’, added flavour to the festivities later in the evening. The entire team of the movie was in attendance. Popular poet-lyricist Vaibhav Joshi presented “Chandane Tuze Maze”. He was accompanied by singers Hrishikesh Ranade and Anjali Marathe.

Earlier on Saturday night, noted vocalist Rahul Deshpande ’s ‘Shayarana’, that premiered at the Times Celebrate Pune festival, took the ghazal aficionados on a delightful journey that continued well past midnight.

He was joined by the talented actor-vocalist Priyanka Barve. Barve enthralled the audience with solo performances of songs ‘Aata Jagayache Ase’, ‘Malawun Taak Deep’, ‘Salonasa Sajan Hai’ and more. She joined Deshpande for a few duets.

“This entire event is all about give and take. You will get as much from me as you give. Leave all your baggage outside and tell yourself that you are only going to be happy tonight,” Deshpande told the audience as he started humming Nasir Kazmi’s “Aaj Dekha Hai Tuze Bahut Der Ke Baad”.

Deshpande’s expertise in this beautiful form left the audience marvelling the delicate power and translucence of his voice. “After completing SSC, I spent almost 12 years learning from ghazal expert Sureshchandra Nadkarni who introduced me to ghazals sung by different singers. Ghazal is all but a form of Bhaavsangeet and my grandfather Vasantrao Deshpande was a connoisseur,” he said adding, “In classical music, the ‘sur’ comes first and the words follow. In bhaavsangeet, however, words come first and the ‘sur’ follows and enriches it. The focus changes and one needs to work on the diction as well.”

The audience was left spellbound as numerous ghazals of renowned poets like Faiz Ahmad Faiz, Ahmad Faraz, Nasir Kazmi and Suresh Bhat were performed. Deshpande also presented a ghazal by Vaibhav Joshi, which is to be a part of his grandfather’s upcoming biopic, “Mee Vasantrao”.

The programme reached its pinnacle with the rendition of “Ranjish Hi Sahi … Dil Hi Dukhane Keliye Aa’ by Deshpande and Barve. Happy with the response of the gathered mass, Deshpande said it was difficult to get an audience for a ‘ghazal-only’ programme. He thanked The Times of India for providing him with a platform.

Aaditya Oak, who accompanied Deshpande on the harmonium, also compèred the event. His wit and repartee had the audience in splits, making Deshpande comment that Oak — though a resident of Thane — was as good as a Punekar. Shayarana would not have been what it was without Anay Gadgil on keyboard, Yashwant Vaishnav on tabla and master Sanjay Das on guitar.

415,['9/03/2020'],"Elephant with open wounds rescued, sent to rehab","Chennai: A 55-year-old cow elephant Jameela with deep open wounds on both sides of its hips was rescued by wildlife officials from Pottalpudhur in Tenkasi district on Sunday and sent to the forest department’s elephant rehabilitation centre in Trichy. Its owner continued to hire the elephant out for functions despite the wounds, which showed no signs of medicare, according to animal welfare activists.

The action by the wildlife authorities was triggered by a complaint sent to them by A S Ramesh, an animal lover, who is a software consultant in Chennai. He told the TOI that he first noticed Jameela’s condition when he visited Pottalpudhur for a function at which she was paraded.

“On both sides of the hips there were deep wounds that had been left open. There was no indication that any ointment had been applied to the wounds. The open wounds posed a grave danger to the very survival of the animal, which was being forced to attend functions in many parts of the state,” he said.

Animal welfare activist Antony Rubin too said veterinary care was totally absent and the animal continued to participate in functions with the open wounds.

Another animal welfare activist, R Raghu, said the animal had been suffering the wounds for more than a decade and that the forest department had rescued the elephant on several occasions, only to release it to the owner’s care in a few days. He said the wounds were the result of making the elephant lie down on cement floors. “Elephants develop small sores when they lie on cement floors. These sores develop into deep wounds when left untreated,” he said. Raghu said the owner had failed to provide any medication to heal the elephant.

Ramesh said only a couple of days ago he sent a letter to the TN chief wildlife warden, S Yuvaraj, who asked the Tirunelveli district forest officer to rescue the animal. On Thursday, a team of vets inspected the elephant and, on Friday, the district captive elephant welfare committee recommended that Jameela should be immediately shifted to the rehabilitation centre. On Sunday, the elephant was transported in a truck to the centre.

Tirunelveli district forest officer N Senthil Kumar, who supervised the shifting operation of Jameela, told TOI that a specially designed truck had been brought from Coimbatore to transport the elephant, which is the fifth to taken to the Trichy centre. First, three elephants belonging to the Kanchi temple, which were under the custody of a private centre at Marakkanam was shifted to Trichy following a Madras High Court order. Subsequently, Gomathi, a cow elephant belonging to Tharumapura Adheena Mutt, was sent there for rehabilitation. Jameela is the fifth inmate of the Trichy centre.

It will tell you when your bus will arrive at a stop too.Preliminary work has begun for the civic body’s intelligent transport system, which has received Rs 660 crore funding from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The civic body will execute the project with the city traffic police and Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC). A team of top officials from the three agencies was formed last week to get the project rolling. A private company is preparing the detailed project report that will determine the scope of the project, after which tenders will be floated for procurement of the software as well as hardware, including CCTV cameras, an official said. The project is expected to be completed in 10 years.According to senior officials, the project has three components. First is an intelligent traffic management system. Around 160 key traffic junctions in the city will be identified and improved. This includes changes to the physical structure of the traffic island as well as the traffic flow, for which inputs would be taken from traffic police.Second, a Chennai traffic information system would be set up to take care of configuration of traffic signals and a signal control plan. For instance, signals are either operated manually by traffic police or the automated systems don’t account for real-time traffic density. Once the intelligent system is set up, it will track the traffic density on each road minute-by-minute and control the signals to ease or avoid congestion. An automatic traffic counter-cum-classifier (ATCC) would project data on digital bulletin boards installed at major roads, informing citizens about which roads are choked and alternative routes to a particular destination. It will also have a flood measurement and warning system for emergencies.The third component is an MTC command and control centre, which would enable a bus tracking system and a passenger information system. With Wi-Fi in city buses and bus stops, passengers will be able to track the next bus to reach their stop and the time it would take to reach their destination.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74543747,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-271127,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/city-corpn-begins-work-on-its-smart-transport-system/articleshow/74543183.cms

AURANGABAD: The International Women’s Day had women taking part in various events held in the city and men pledging their support to women in the society.

The bike rally organised by Maharashtra Times and Times of India on Sunday, had a large number of woman participants. Many women wore traditional Maharashtrian headgear and Paithani sarees. They participated in large groups and promoted various social causes.

The Aurangabad zilla parishad honoured the school teachers to mark the occasion. ZP president Meena Shelke, MLC Ambadas Danve, former Maharashtra assembly speaker Haribhau Bagade were among the others who were present in the event.

In a unique event in Latur, around 2,000 men took out a rally in support of women. The rally, organised under the banner of Bhartiya Stree Shakti, witnessed men in white holding placards that had slogans like “Men Are With Women” and “Safe Women, Safe Society” written on them.

State minister of environment, drinking water and sanitation Sanjay Bansode and former MP Gopalrao Patil addressed the rally. A delegation led by MLA Abhimanyu Pawar submitted a letter to district collector G. Sreekanth, on behalf of the women demanding increase in police patrolling to contain incidents of harassment.

They also asked the administration to ensure that the CCTV cameras are installed across the city. Establishment of fast track court for cases on violence against women, sensitive approach by police towards women complainants were among other demands.

Churches in the city held programmes to appreciate women across Marathwada. On the occasion of Women’s Day, a special prayer meeting was held at Beed’s Assemblies of God. The women members of the congregation were felicitated with flowers. Pastor Charles Sonawane delivered a message highlighting the strong women in the Bible.

As part of the annual programme, Avishkar Social and Education Foundation, Kolhapur, awarded women achievers from different fields. The awardees included Nandini Chapalgaonkar, Asha Bhand, Shubhangi Kale, Rita Maitrewar, Prutha Veer, Poonam Swami, Sushma Bembe and others.

A health guidance camp was organised at Jai Bhawani Chowk to mark the occasion. Experts Meenkashi Malode and Swapnil Mali guided the attendees on maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle.

419,['9/03/2020'],Civic polls to end rule of spl officers at last,"Guntur: The special officers’ rule in Guntur Municipal Corporation ( GMC ) is set to finally come to an end with the state commission (SEC) gearing to hold the municipal elections. The last elections to the civic body were held in 2005 and its term ended in 2010.

The failure of two successive governments to conduct the elections had left people without any say in the civic administration as the decisions were taken by the officials. The absence of the elected council had not only brought the development in the city to a halt, but also inconvenienced the public as their grievances mostly remained unaddress.

Moreover, the absence of an elected council had given contractors and field officials a free run. It is one of the prime reasons for most city roads being broken following the UGD work. The state government had begun the Rs 1,000 crore UGD project without conducting the civic body elections. And the public health engineering department was given the responsibility to overlook the project that it failed to manage for lack of manpower. Almost 600km long-road network in the city was dug up to lay the UGD pipeline and were then left unrepaired.

To top that, the city witnessed one of the worst incidents when diarrhoea killed over 40 people in a span of 15 days in 2018 due to the polluted drinking water supplied by the GMC. “The official machinery is solely responsible for such major tragedy. No city has suffered due to official apathy in the recent past,” said social activist SVS Lakshminarayana. The presence of field-level public representatives like corporators would have definitely helped officials look into the issue early and prevented so many deaths, he said.

421,['9/03/2020'],Pune: Sandalwood thieves target campuses as authorities struggle with security,"Representative image

PUNE: The sprawling campuses of government, academic and research establishments in the city have become soft targets of sandalwood tree thieves, with the authorities struggling to take apt measures to check such thefts.

Sample this: A total of 66 thefts of sandalwood trees have been reported from 2016 from various campuses. Police could detect only 25 of them.

Police claimed a decline in sandalwood thefts after the arrest of three gangs between 2016 and 2019. But in reality, the culprits have been striking at regular intervals. The most recent incidents occurred at the National Institute of Bank Management , Kondhwa, and the Regional Ayurveda Institute for Fundamental Research in Kothrud, accentuating the problem.

The police pointed their fingers at the “inadequate security” on campuses as the prime factor behind sandalwood thefts. “Such crimes will decline if the security system is improved, trained guards are posted, compound walls are built, superior quality CCTV cameras are deployed for monitoring movement and microchip cards are embedded in trees for relaying alerts in case of any theft attempt,” additional commissioner of police Ashok Morale, who heads the Pune crime branch, told TOI.

A state forest officer, who did not wish to be named, said, “An effective tree census can be one of the solution towards keeping a tab on the number of sandalwood trees and their apt conservation.”

He said, “Southern states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which account for a major share of sandalwood cultivation in India, have been experimenting with the technology of embedding microchips in the trees, which can send alerts if anyone is cutting them. However, the cost of such microchips is an impediment.”

Morale said, “Scarcity of sandalwood trees drives the culprits to target campuses, particularly those engaged in agriculture and medicinal research, for sourcing the sought-after wood. Lax security only makes their task easier.”

The NIBM director, K L Dhingra, said, “We are deploying additional CCTV cameras and lights at critical areas on our campus to prevent recurrence of sandalwood thefts. We have also requested the police to increase the frequency of patrolling around our campus.”

Savitribai Phule Pune University’s security chief Suresh Bhosale said, “We have tightened security, particularly near the IUCAA and the B C Joshi gates of our campus, and have deployed a quick response team with walkie talkies at the university’s main gate. Six CCTV cameras have been installed at strategic locations for monitoring activities around the trees.”

Bhosale said, “We have written to the forest department to do apt numbering of sandalwood trees on its premises behind our campus. If done, we shall intensify patrolling there too.”

Morale said, “Our investigation has revealed that thieves deploy a typical modus operandi of conducting recce to identify the trees which can be chopped and stolen during the night time from the campuses. The stolen wood is then sold to receivers at cheap rate and the receivers, in turn, sell them at a higher price to those involved in manufacturing sandalwood products.”

Deputy commissioner of police Bachchan Singh said, “Gangs from Ahmednagar , Solapur and Khed (in Pune district) are known for indulging in sandalwood thefts. We are pursuing our investigation to detect the pending cases.”

Lawyer Abhijit Sakurkar, who has been representing the forest department in many cases related to smuggling of sandalwood trees, said, “The state and central government organizations should conduct census and identify sandalwood trees on their premises, and chalk out a security plan for preventing thefts.”

423,['9/03/2020'],"Telangana Budget 2020: Rs 10,000 crore for Hyderabad with eye on GHMC polls","Telangana finance minister T Harish Rao

HYDERABAD: With an eye on Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections in the near future, the state government has earmarked Rs 10,000 crore for development of Hyderabad urban agglomeration area in the budget for the 2020-2021 financial year.

Though in the past funds were allocated for specific projects in Hyderabad as part of the municipal administration department’s budget, it is for the first time the metropolis gets funds under a separate head. Apart from Hyderabad, 141 municipalities and municipal corporations have been allocated Rs 14,809 crore to take up developmental works.

Many agencies, including Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI), had estimated that about Rs 50,000 crore would be required for modernising storm water drains, road and junction improvement and rehauling drinking water and sewer network.

Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had already announced that the government would now focus on improving urban infrastructure in the second term. The Rs 10,000 crore would be part of Rs 50,000 crore it plans to spend on various infrastructure and other developmental works in the next four years. However, the government did not explain how it would raise funds, whether it would be through its own resources or mobilise it from financial institutions.

In his budget speech, finance minister T Harish Rao mentioned that huge funds were allocated for Hyderabad as the city was being transformed into a global city and the amount would be used to carry out Musi river purification, Musi riverfront development works and all other special projects.

He said the state government had sought special funds from the Centre for Hyderabad along with other six Metro cities in the country. Since the Centre did not consider the proposal, the state government wants to go ahead with its own development plan.

According to officials, the GHMC has sought Rs 2,300 crore for completion of flyovers and underpasses under the strategic road development plan (SRDP) and 2-BHK houses. The Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) has sought Rs 2,175 crore for completing drinking water supply network along the Outer Ring Road, ring main network and also reservoirs within ORR.

As the present GHMC council’s term would end in February, 2021, elections might to be held by 2020-end.

Official said it would be a big task before the civic agencies to complete pending works before the elections.

424,['9/03/2020'],Judge hearing final arguments in Naroda riots case transferred,"Maya Kodnani (File Photo)

AHMEDABAD: Eleven years after trial began in the 2002 Naroda Gam massacre case, in which former Gujarat minister Maya Kodnani is an accused, the Gujarat high court has transferred SIT court judge M K Dave. The development, which comes at a time when the trial was on the verge of completion, may delay the verdict in the case.

Judge Dave was hearing the final arguments from Kodnani when the HC ordered his transfer on Friday (March 6). Dave has been moved to Valsad district and will be replaced by Bhavnagar principal district judge S K Baxi. Forty district and sessions judges were transferred by the HC on Friday.

With judge Dave’s transfer, all the advocates may have to make their arguments again. Final arguments on the basis of the bulky record of evidence in this case had begun in February 2018. It first started before then SIT court judge P B Desai. He retired from service when the prosecution completed its arguments the same year.

When the case got a new judge in Dave immediately after judge Desai’s retirement, the prosecution had to make the arguments by reading the evidence again. Most of the defence lawyers also made their arguments before judge Dave. Arguments made by advocate Chetan Shah, who represented many of the 84 accused persons in this case, lasted nearly a year. After him, other defence lawyers completed their arguments.

Kodnani’s advocate Amit Patel started his arguments last week. Patel had read the evidence and argued for three days when the HC decided to transfer Dave.

In his argument, Patel told the SIT court that Kodnani was not in the Naroda area when the violence took place on February 28, 2002. Eleven people were killed in the Naroda Gam violence.

The lawyer highlighted parts of the testimonies of prosecution witnesses and told the court that Kodnani was at Sola Civil Hospital and at various places outside Naroda when the violence was taking place in Naroda Gam.

This is not the first time that Kodnani has claimed that she was not in Naroda, as is claimed by various witnesses in the case. The witnesses had testified to her presence along with former VHP leader Jaideep Patel and Bajrang Dal leader Babu Bajrangi just outside the locality, where Kodnani allegedly instigated a mob, which then indulged in violence.

Kodnani was booked in this case in 2008, after the Supreme Court constituted the SIT and ordered it to further investigate nine 2002 cases. She was also arraigned in the Naroda Patia massacre, in which 97 people were killed. She had claimed an alibi in this case, but her alibi was not accepted by the SIT court and she was sentenced to 28 years in prison in 2008, for conspiracy, murder and rioting.

However, Kodnani was in 2018 acquitted by the Gujarat high court, which said there was not enough evidence against her in the Naroda Patia case. The HC noticed that none of the 11 eyewitnesses could provide the number of the vehicle in which she allegedly reached the spot. It held that the SIT court had wrongly accepted witnesses’ testimonies by brushing aside discrepancies in their accounts.

AURANGABAD: A 27-year-old criminal on record was arrested by the police for allegedly trying to extort Rs 2 crore from a city-based industrialist.

Local crime branch personnel also seized three cellphones — one stolen — along with a SIM card that was procured using forged documents.

The suspect, identified as Shankar, alias Aaba Damodar Shendge, is a resident of Bag Pimpalgaon of Gevrai in Beed district. Officials said he would be produced before the court on Monday. A case against Shendge has been registered at the Sillod rural police station.

Crime branch inspector Bhagwat Phunde said Shendge was previously convicted in a bank theft case and had spent nine months behind bars before he secured a bail.

Sub-inspector Bhagatsingh Dulat said Shendge, after securing bail, started a tea stall opposite a mill belonging to the complainant, Dinesh Sevakram Muchala , who is an industrialist and a resident of N-3 Cidco, New Aurangabad. The mills is located in Gevrai, Beed.

Dulat said Muchala started receiving extortion calls from an unidentified number from February 17 this year. Officials suspect Shendge may have learned of the income-tax searches that were carried out at businesses owned by the complainant. They said he then started calling Muchala with claims he had important documents that could be used as evidence by the I-T sleuths. Police said an investigation later revealed Shendge has made the calls using a stolen mobile phone and a SIM card that was bought using forged documents.

Muchala, in his complaint, said the caller had demanded a sum of Rs 2 crore.

Following the detection, Aurangabad rural superintendent of police Mokshada Patil told TOI: “All establishments must give credentials and backgrounds of their employees at local police stations. This action is result of the preparation of crime clock of my district to present and detect property offences.”

AURANGABAD: The environmental activists have expressed their concerns on the drying up of the recently planted saplings along the Solapur-Yedshi National Highway.

The National Highway green policy, launched by Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari in 2015, mandates utilisation of 1% of the highway project’s cost on plantation and beautification. During the construction of the NH-211, the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) had chopped down several trees for the same.

The saplings planted 2-3 months ago along the national highway going through Aurangabad have already started to wither with no watering by the authorities.

According to the policy, the agency appointed for the construction is responsible for the plantation and maintenance of the trees for a period of five years. The policy states that the survival of the saplings should be 90 percent. The agency has to ensure that the saplings are protected with barbed wire or any other enclosure.

Kishor Pathak, an environment activist, said that the saplings near Nipani Village in Chittegaon near Aurangabad on the NH-211 has dried up. “The saplings were planted hardly three months ago but they have already dried up. Also, there were no fence or cement guards put up by the planting agency to protect them,” he said.

In a meeting held a few weeks ago in the presence of a divisional commissioner Sunil Kendrekar, the environmental activists demanded that the plants that have dried up should be replaced. Environmental activist Meghna Badjate of We for Environment (WE) group said that in the meeting it was decided that the dried up plants will be replaced. “There are many patches along the 178-km stretch of the highway which has not been covered in the plantation. The agency has been asked to covers these patches and replaces the dried up plants with fresh ones,” Badjate said.

It has also been decided that the agency should carry out theme plantation on the highway under which the same species of trees should be planted on both sides of the roads for at least a stretch of one kilometre.

This season, wheat was sown in around 44,000 hectares by nearly 48,000 farmers in the district. And out of these 48,000 farmers, only 2,335 have got crop insurance under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana.

Meanwhile, the agriculture department maintains that it doesn’t yet have the exact data of crop damage.

430,['9/03/2020'],Jharkhand starts probe into ‘hunger death’,"RANCHI: A day after a 40-year-old man allegedly died of hunger in Bokaro district , Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren on Saturday ordered an inquiry into his death. Soren directed the food and civil supplies secretary and the deputy commissioner to carry out the probe into the death of Bhukhal Ghasi, a member of the SC community, at Shankartola Kamra village.

On Saturday, Ghasi’s wife Rekha was quoted by reporters as saying that they did not have any food for the last few days as they had no ration.

Soon after the CM gave the order, which he later tweeted, officials of the Bokaro district administration visited Ghasi’s village. They provided 20kg of rice and a ration card to the family members on the spot but denied the death had occurred due to hunger.

Talking to TOI over phone, BDO of Kasmar block, under which Ghasi’s village falls, Rajesh Kumar Sinha said, “Reports about (Ghasi’s) hunger death are completely false and driven by propaganda by a section of people. The clinical test by a medical board has shown that blood sugar levels of the deceased were normal, which cannot be the case if he had died of hunger. We also found foodgrains in the house of the deceased during our visit on Saturday and there were enough traces to prove that food was cooked and consumed by the family members on Friday. We have also taken video footage of food in the house.”

Sinha, who visited Ghasi’s village again on Sunday, said the deceased had returned home from Bangalore, where he was working as a labourer, around June-July last year after the death of his parents. He had five children, two sons and three daughters. The two sons are grown up and are working as daily wagers while the three minor sisters are studying in the government school at the village, the BDO said, adding that three brothers of the deceased also live nearby and collectively own 1.35 acres of land.

Sinha conceded that the family did not have a ration card, but said they received foodgrains till July last year on the card issued in the name of Ghasi’s late father. “In August, Ghasi had applied for a ration card which was pending approval. The district had reached saturation point for distribution of ration for the fiscal; hence, his card was pending,” Sinha said.

The BDO further said the family members of Ghasi and the brothers of the deceased had given a formal statement on Sunday saying that his death was due to illness.

Sinha said, “Since his return to Kasmar last year, Ghasi was bedridden and suffering from hydrothorax. Though a few family members tried to take him to Rims for treatment, he couldn’t be admitted as there was no one to accompany him as an attendant. He had an MNREGA job card but had stopped availing work because of his health condition.”

This is the first instance of alleged starvation death since the new government of JMM-Congress-RJD combine took charge in December last year. During last year’s assembly polls, the alliance had blamed the previous NDA government under then chief minister Raghubar Das for over two dozen deaths allegedly due to hunger.

431,['9/03/2020'],"Crude Oil Price: Corona, split in Opec+ may bring crude relief","NEW DELHI: Oil could once again prove to be Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s friend at a time his government is grappling with economic slowdown. The end of the three-year marriage between Saudi Arabia-led Opec and Russia, coming amid faltering global demand due to economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak, could hammer oil prices below the $40/barrel mark, various estimates say.For India, which imports 83% of its oil, an extended spell of low prices will bring down fuel prices faster and leave money in the government’s kitty for incentives to revive growth without pulling back on social spending. Moscow jilted Opec at Friday’s crunch talks in Vienna for deepening the current production cut to nearly 4% of global supply. Riyadh responded by announcing discounts of $6-8/barrel and plans to raise production up to 12 million barrels per day, or 23% higher than the current level. Other West Asian producers will certainly take the cue, which will set off a price war and deepen the glut.This is reminiscent of November 28, 2014, when Saudi Arabia started a price war by stonewalling an Opec plan to cut production and offered discounts to squeeze low-cost US shale oil from grabbing market share. The shock waves from that move sent oil prices into a near-freefall, with Brent tumbling to $29.11 per barrel on November 1, 2016.The crash had allowed the government to shore up finances by raising excise duty nine times between November 2014 and January 2016 and splurge on big-ticket social schemes. When Modi became PM for the first time in May 2014, India’s crude purchase cost $108/barrel. By the third year, it had more than halved to $48/barrel.Something similar could be happening again. India’s 2019-20 crude purchase has averaged $64/barrel so far and is likely to be little lower at final count, while the government’s maths is based on a $65/barrel. Cheaper oil reduces drag on government finances by reducing subsidy outgo and import bill — the latter improving balance of payments position. Lower demand for dollar to pay for oil helps the rupee. Low fuel prices brings down cost of living and services, creating ground for putting money into people’s pocket by reducing interest rates.A spell of cheaper oil, at least for the first six months as predicted by market trackers across the board, will be a good beginning for 2020-21.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74543520,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-900669,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/corona-split-in-opec-may-bring-crude-relief/articleshow/74543521.cms
432,['9/03/2020'],Having hallucinations since I lost my ‘baby’ Yes Bank: Rana Kapoor,"MUMBAI: A small courtroom tucked away in a corner of the second floor of the sessions court was unusually busy for a Sunday afternoon. The remand hearing of Rana Kapoor before the “holiday court” — the lone court in charge for remands on Sundays and public holidays — saw a bevy of lawyers, cops, court staff and journalists in the otherwise-desolate premises.

After a hospital visit to assess the Yes Bank founder’s health, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) brought the 62-year-old to the court around 11.40am and made him sit in the ‘decree department’ a few feet from the courtroom. His wife Bindu followed soon after him. Proceedings commenced around 12.40pm before judge SR Salunkhe with prosecution and defence submitting arguments.

Dressed in the same track pants and T-shirt in which he had left home hours earlier on Saturday, an emotional Kapoor told the judge that he had not slept a wink despite being under treatment of a top psychiatrist. “I’ve hallucinations and I’ve been sick since I lost my baby, Yes Bank. I’m under cure. I was taken to two hospitals. Report says I need to be treated. I promise I will cooperate. I swear by my wife, my three daughters,” he said.

Flanked by ED officers, he was standing at the back of the courtroom, with his wife and son-in-law nearby.

Kapoor said he was willing to surrender his passport. Dramatically taking it out of his track pant pocket, he said, “They (ED) returned it to me. They can take it back.”

Recalling the events leading up to his arrest at 4am on Sunday, he submitted he had been “understanding and cooperating” from the time ED came to his home, spending almost 14 hours there. “I worked meticulously with the assistant director and his team on a seven-page statement which has every item, every allegation made here. I’ve fully clarified here, I’ve signed it. For some reason, it has not been tabled.”

Kapoor spoke uninterrupted for several minutes, adding to what his lawyer had said in his defence. He said that DHFL was a triple-A-rated company which borrowed about Rs 9,000 crore from Yes Bank. “My children’s company borrowed Rs 600 crore independently. Rs 130.5 crore interest has been paid on that. There is full security. My eldest daughter could not be here as she is expecting her second child. Her personal guarantee at the peak, when she offered the guarantee to DHFL… (was) over almost Rs 2,000 crore… We cannot look at just security, we have to look at the behaviour of the account,” he said.

Though the police had shut the small courtroom’s doors fearing overcrowding, Kapoor’s voice was loud and could be heard in the corridor. Continuing, he said that every iota of the interest had been paid over two and a half years. “This is about women’s entrepreneurship, no link I promise. When I left Yes Bank on January 31, 2019, there was not a single delay in DHFL payments,” he said.

Kapoor submitted that there were “so many other heinous crimes” being committed, setting it in contrast with the matter on hand, which he said pertained to a performing loan that belonged to his children and that he didn’t own a single share in their company. “My three daughters are paying interest on the dot. I've recorded in the statement on behalf of my children that the payment of the full principal will happen when it's due, which is March 2023 or sooner as the monetization of assets in that company permits,” Kapoor said.

He said that while the assets and capital of the company being overlooked is Rs 300 crore, the loan is Rs 600 crore. “Debt equity is moderate. And the investment pool of that company by far exceeds about Rs 700 crore. Like my counsel said, this when a loan is performing, you want to put their father, who has been mentor to his babies, and for what sir? I'm willing to co-operate,” he said. The court later remanded him to ED custody until Wednesday. Kapoor was immediately whisked away by ED and driven back to their Ballard Estate office.

For a while, the Reserve Bank of India and the government, which were keeping tabs on the bank, were mystified as to why this was happening.The puzzlement gave way to suspicion that ousted promoter Rana Kapoor had a hand in sabotaging a turnaround plan after the 62-year-old, now in ED’s custody, started sending feelers to the government and the RBI indicating his keenness to return to the bank, according to highly placed sources close to the developments. In one case, the RBI had even told a marquee investor that it could deposit money in an escrow account. “Every time things appeared to be heading towards finality, his people would meet potential investors and probably talk them out of it,” a top government source told TOI.Finally, in an attempt to lure Kapoor back from London—where he’d been camping for several months—the RBI is said to have conveyed an impression that given the failed attempts to attract new investors, it might be open to him returning to the bank he had co-founded in 2004.But as soon as he returned, multiple investigative agencies mounted surveillance on him to ensure he did not flee the country. In fact, sources said, there were a few nervous occasions when he went off the radar briefly.During a visit to the sea-facing apartment building in Worli—one of the most expensive in Mumbai, and the country— where Kapoor lived (as did fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi), ED officials were told by the building guards they had cultivated that there were signs that Kapoor was planning to leave India again, prompting them to tighten vigil. He may have realised that the RBI and government were considering a reconstruction plan that didn’t involve him.With a board meeting of the bank scheduled for March 14 to consider quarterly results, there was mounting concern within the financial sector that Yes Bank’s bad loans—disclosed at about Rs 16,000 crore in September—were approaching crisis proportions, and could trigger a wider meltdown. Large depositors with their ear to the ground had already started to pull their money out.Within government, there had been some debate as to whether Kapoor should be arrested—risking loss of confidence in the bank—or if the focus should be on getting new investors led by State Bank of India. With time running out, the government decided to bite the bullet—almost simultaneously imposing a moratorium, announcing a reconstruction plan, and green-lighting action against Kapoor.

In 2004 cultivation of tiger prawn and Vannamei variety of shrimps got affected owing to the outbreak of white spot syndromes.Experts said, previously there was a huge demand for tiger prawns and Vannamei in countries like Japan, China, Germany, Gulf countries and the USA. However, the demand fell because of the white spot syndrome in Indian prawns.“From around 150 hatcheries in 2004 now Visakhapatnam has less than 40 hatcheries. Although the consumption and export have increased in the last two years it would receive a setback again owing to the outbreak of coronavirus,” added Dasu.But farmers pointed out that coronavirus is only one of the reasons for the fall in consumption.“First, we are not getting quality seeds. Second, cold storage facility is inadequate. In fact, we are not getting government support to run our business. If such a scenario continues we have to shut down the farm,” said Gopala Rao, a farmer.This has also affected the ancillary businesses. “Business is not as good as it used to be before 2004. Demand for equipment for prawn farming has reduced considerably over the years and it is falling further,” said Adnan Sabuwala, a supplier of prawn farming material and equipment.",visakhapatnam,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74546397,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-305963,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/corona-scene-likely-to-hit-already-struggling-prawn-farmers-in-ap/articleshow/74542251.cms

VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh state agriculture commissioner H Arun Kumar announced during his tour of Vizianagaram district on Saturday that the state government is planning to set up plant health clinics in all mandal headquarters of the district.

The commissioner said that these will be set up across the state to facilitate the growth of the agriculture sector through crop monitoring.

The agriculture commissioner further announced that the state government is developing a mobile application for agriculture and associated departments could be provided in a coordinated manner.

Kumar informed that the app would help monitor a digital data bank about agriculture practices, techniques, methods and actual volumes of production.

In course of the announcement, the agriculture commissioner stressed on the need to cultivate a healthy relationship with the farming community so as to ensure that they put their trust in the agriculture department.

He further said that the state government is keen on converting the Rythu Bharosa centres into local nerve centres to promote a healthier and more interactive relationship between farmers and the agriculture department.

He added that these centres would ensure that the department reaches out to farmers and provides those necessary help and guidance.

Visakhapatnam: With the state government having finalised the ward-wise reservations for the local body elections and deciding that the mayor seat for Vizag will go to backward classes (BC) category, the principal political parties in contest have started the hunt for suitable candidates. Political parties are busy brainstorming on strategy with only two weeks left for the elections.

While TDP organised a coordination committee meeting on Saturday to chalk out the course of action YSRC held an extensive executive body meeting on Sunday for the same purpose. Jana Sena and BJP, who have recently come together, also discussed their poll strategy in separate party meetings in Vijayawada on Sunday.

The key focus area of all parties in the upcoming polls is the votes of people from BC communities, as they form the lion’s share of the electorate— 53% of the total 17.51 lakh electorate. However, with the political narrative this election yet to emerge, there’s no saying which way the BC vote will swing.

While the ruling YSRC seeks to bank on welfare schemes and development activities taken up over the last nine months, TDP’s narrative will be to highlight the alleged failures of the government. Sources say that TDP is looking at candidates who enjoy the support of party activists and play significant roles in their wards. All four MLAs of the city’s core constituencies are from TDP, which the party is likely to leverage. Meanwhile, the BJP-Jana Sena alliance is pinning its hopes on anti-incumbency. TDP’s Ch Ayyanna Patrudu told party cadre, “Our party flag should fly high in the GVMC polls.

MUMBAI: A woman police officer escaped a bid on her life days after she had foiled a bid to hack into a bank account of Tata Sons. Seven men were nabbed from Nalasopara last Monday for allegedly trying to siphon off Rs 200 crore from the company's bank account, the police said.

Two unidentified men on a bike fired at the car of assistant inspector Siddhawa Jaybhaye of the Palghar crime branch on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad highway near Virar on Saturday night.

The officer was on her way to Palghar along with a constable when the firing took place. Around 8.45 pm, Jaybhaye halted the car when the two masked men wearing black jackets and riding on a 'Pulsar' motorbike fired a round in the direction of her vehicle. The bullet hit the bonnet. The bike-borne duo fled in the direction of Palghar.

The police said they are examining footage from closed circuit television cameras around the spot on the highway to get leads on the shooters. The two-wheeler from which the bullet was fired did not have any registration number.

A case of attempt to murder has been registered at Virar police station.

Soon after the firing incident, the police held nakabandis on the highway. Two-wheeler riders were flagged down and their documents checked.

448,['9/03/2020'],"A month after launch, govt's pro-citizen plan floundering","TimesView Jana Sevak is based on a similar scheme launched by the Arvind Kejriwal government in Delhi, but unlike AAP's model, the Karnataka one already had the software in place - Seva Sindu - to ensure its success. Both are offshoots of the up-and-running Sakala scheme. And yet, the Delhi government has been able to deliver more than 100 services at a much cheaper cost to the applicant than in Karnataka! With awareness and reliability, Jana Sevaka would certainly have attracted more applications, but that the scheme is already floundering speaks volumes about the priorities and efficiency of the government.

How the Jan Sevaka scheme works

BENGALURU: After formally launching 'Jana Sevaka' initiative less than a month ago, the Karnataka government , reeling under a financial crisis, is scrambling to save the scheme that aims to deliver government documents to citizens' doorsteps.The scheme requires substantial allocations, but the crisis-hit government is considering a public-private partnership (PPP) model to keep it afloat. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa announced in his budget last week that the scheme would be extended to all 28 assembly constituencies in Bengaluru city and 10 city corporations in Karnataka. But he did not allocate funds for the purpose.Although formally launched earlier this year, a pilot has been under way since March 2019 in four assembly constituencies - Dasarahalli, Bommanahalli, Mahadevpura and Rajajinagar. Officials said more than 41,000 transactions were successfully completed since then. The figure is a modest one, but officials said with awareness it is bound to grow.Now, the e-governance department has been forced to fend for itself. It has a meagre allocation of Rs 8 crore for both Jana Sevaka scheme and Seva Sindhu - an online initiative to receive applications from citizens to avail government services. ""Given practical issues, a PPP model is the most viable option for Jana Sevaka. Tenders will soon be floated to identify a vendor for the service,"" said Varaprasad Reddy, project director, Jana Sevaka and Seva Sindhu.The Jana Sevaka pilot offered to deliver 53 documents from six departments. And while the government plans to eventually include all 1,017 services from across 300 departments under the scheme, no new services were offered when the project was formally launched. Efforts were on to include the 451 services from 45 departments enlisted under the Seva Sindhu portal in the first phase. But the entire exercise calls for humongous resources and manpower.This, despite applicants having to pay Rs 115 per transaction as delivery charge, besides the fee for the document. Officials estimate it would require at least five Jana Sevakas (delivery boys) in each of the 198 BBMP wards.The government pays Rs 13,000 plus incentive as monthly salary to a Jana Sevaka, who has to be a graduate. The unattractive salary has resulted in a high attrition rate. Sakala minister S Suresh Kumar is learnt to have requested Yediyurappa for additional funds, but the CM hasn't obliged.""The PPP model will not just make the scheme sustainable, but also fetch revenue to the exchequer,"" said Rajeev Chawla, additional chief secretary, e-governance. ""The agency that lands the contract will share the revenue with the government.""A citizen needs to apply for the required service online on Seva Sindhu web portal. A designated Jan Sevaka, an outsourced employee, would then meet the applicant, fill up forms and scan documents (such as proof of residence or identity) through a tablet. The Jan Sevaka would then deliver the document applied for at the citizen's doorstep within a stipulated deadline.At present, the 53 services include income certificate, land-holding certificate, old-age pension and widow pension. About 35 people are employed. Currently, the entire fee of Rs 115 per service goes to the government, but under PPP model it will be shared with the agency on an agreed ratio.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74543600,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-563507,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/a-month-after-launch-govts-pro-citizen-plan-floundering/articleshow/74543595.cms

Going by the 2019 Lok Sabha poll results, BJP secured a lead in nearly 45 civic bodies in the state. The results prompted state BJP leaders to launch outreach programmes ahead of civic polls and go for intense mass contact drives across Bengal.

During Union home minister Amit Shah’s visit this month, Bengal BJP leaders were set the target of winning in at least 50 civic bodies where it had secured leads during Lok Sabha elections. “We are looking at leading in at least 30 wards in Kolkata and 22 wards in Howrah municipal corporations. The numbers might increase following campaigns such as ‘Aar Nay Anyay’ (no more injustice),” a Bengal BJP leader said on Sunday.

At an organisational meeting the same day, BJP general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh asked functionaries and ‘karyakartas’ to submit a report on each civic body to the party brass in New Delhi in three days. “We have received over 3 lakh missed calls during ‘Aar Nay Anyay’ campaign in the past few days. Growing numbers have shown the disillusionment people have with civic bodies in the state,” Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said.

On Sunday, BJP launched a four-page document pointing out the state administration’s failures. “We will publish separate manifestos for each municipality soon. We will also give details of our plans for better governance and services at civic bodies,” Ghosh said. The BJP had rolled out a similar campaign against Telangana Rashtra Samithi last year where it adopted a two-pronged strategy of criticising the administration’s failures and showcasing centrally sponsored schemes.

The saffron party, meanwhile, has asked its workers to start the municipal poll campaign’s second phase from March 15. “While the campaign will criticise the state government and raise questions, we will also present Sankalpa Patra (promises) to people. This will continue beyond civic body polls to the assembly elections next year,” Ghosh said.

BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu said: “We will focus on cases of corruption of sitting councillors and rake up issues ward-wise.” While a draft list of civic poll candidates has already been prepared, the final list is likely to be published by middle of the month.

450,['9/03/2020'],"Climate change could affect India’s GDP, warns report","Kolkata: Climate change and global warming could have an effect on India’s GDP in the near future, warns a report published by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI).

By 2030, the report warns, temperatures in India could reach such levels that in sectors exposed to lethal heat waves, workers might be forced to cut short daylight working hours. The impact of global heating on outdoor work and the resultant loss in productivity could put 2.5% to 4.5% of India’s GDP at risk annually, estimates MGI.

Unless there is an effective adaptation response and de-carbonization, within 10 years, 160 million to 200 million people in India could live in regions that might be exposed to lethal heat waves every year. In case that happens, in many areas, temperatures could exceed the survivability threshold. It might reach lethal levels and just 4 to 5 hours of outdoor exposure could turn fatal for a healthy, well-hydrated human being at rest in shade. By 2050, several pockets in India and Pakistan are projected to experience a more-than-60% annual chance of such a heat wave.

The issue is so serious that the report has suggested mass climate migration as an adaptive measure. “Reducing exposure in high-risk areas could be one means by which to manage risk, as is being considered today in flood-prone regions,” Mekala Krishnan, one of the authors of the report, told TOI.

The sectors at greater risk include agriculture, mining, and quarrying, as also also indoor sectors with poor AC penetration, such as manufacturing, hospitality, and transport. The urban poor, too, are likely to be disproportionately affected.

Heat and humidity could affect labour productivity, “with workers needing to take more breaks and the human body naturally limiting its efforts to prevent over-exertion,” the report says.

In case greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, urban areas in parts of India and Pakistan could be the first places in the world to experience heat waves that exceed the survivability threshold. In India, the coasts and the Gangetic plains are “exposed to higher risk of extreme heat and humidity compared with the higher elevation and interior Deccan plain, because these regions facilitate the mixing of humid oceanic air with hot and dry continental air. The current lethal heat wave risk is restricted to a small area along the Pakistan-India border,” the report says.

“As of 2017, in India, heat-exposed work produces about 50% of GDP, drives about 30% of GDP growth, and employs about 75% of the labour force, some 380 million people,” it adds.

For adaptation in the short term, India can focus on early-warning systems and cooling shelters to protect those without air-conditioning. “Working hours for outdoor workers could be shifted, and... at the extreme, coordinated movement of people and capital from high-risk areas could be organized,” the report suggests.

“The report highlights a series of adaptation measures that stakeholder can consider. They include protecting assets and people, building resilience, reducing exposure, and using finance and insurance,” said Krishnan.

Reacting to the MGI report, Subhashis Sahu of Kalyani University’s Ergonomics & Occupational Physiology Laboratory said: “More than 80% workers engaged in informal sectors in India are exposed to occupation heat stress. The climate change with anticipated increase in heat exposure will certainly affect the productivity. Our study on rice harvesters, brickfield workers and construction workers showed that a rise in WBGT (heat stress) by one degree Celsius will bring down productivity by up to 10%. It will also cause more cardiac stress, early fatigue and heat exertion. The older and female workers are more vulnerable to such stress factors.” Sahu’s work on loss of productivity caused by rising temperature have been cited by ILO and IPCC in their reports.

Maitreesh Ghatak, of The London School of Economics and Political Science, said: “Climate change will have a serious impact on growth and this will be particularly pronounced in developing countries like India and the consequence (of global warming) on nearly 50% of the working population in India that depend on agriculture will be severe.”

Economist Bibhas Saha of Durham University Business School, UK, said: “The manifestation of climate risk will be local. So, the costs, too, will be very unevenly distributed. But temperature rise will badly hit the agricultural sector. In some places like Kashmir and Uttarakhand, agricultural productivity will increase, but in the rest of the country the effects may be deadly, with harsh and prolonged summers and unpredictable rain.”

451,['9/03/2020'],"In three months, onion goes from Rs 100 to Rs 20 in Kolkata","Representative image

KOLKATA: The price of onions , which had crossed the hundred-rupee-per-kilo mark at several markets in the city last December, bringing tears in many middle-class families, has crashed to a low of Rs 20 per kilo in the last couple of days, restoring the smiles ahead of the twin festivals of Doljatra/Holi.

The price crash — caused by primarily a bumper crop in Bengal — comes as a huge relief to those who had to replace the ubiquitous onion with other vegetables in order to balance monthly budgets, with the price touching even Rs 150-Rs 160 per kilo in mid-December.

Market experts said the price may drop further — to even Rs 10-Rs 12 per kilo — if the government does not lift the ban on export, imposed following a severe shortage of supply that had caused the onion crisis last year. The situation has reversed now because of a bumper onion crop across the country, particularly in Nashik (Maharashtra) and Bellary (Karnataka).

Bengal now produces 7 lakh tonnes of onion annually, up from 1.5 lakh tonnes five-six years ago. “We are hopeful of achieving to produce 8-8.5 lakh tonnes per year by 2021, which is the estimated consumption of the state. It will, however, depend on favourable weather conditions,” said Pradip Mazumdar, chief advisor to the state agriculture department.

Bankura, Nadia, Hooghly, Murshidabad and parts of Burdwan are Bengal’s major onion-production zones. “Bengal’s crop comes late in the season. But, this time, it is coming in plenty, crashing the wholesale price to Rs 650- Rs 700 for a 40kg bag (Rs 16.25 to Rs 17.50 per kilo). Since these freshly harvested onions cannot be preserved long, the crash of retail price is also inevitable,” said Kamal Dey, president, West Bengal Vegetable Vendors Association.

Last year, the onion price had touched Rs 50 per kilo on November 1. Since then, the price rose to peak at Rs 150-Rs 160 per kilo, leading the state government to sell onion at a subsidized price of Rs 59 per kilo through the network of its 960 ration shops and 131 Sufal Bangla stores.

While most households would be happy at the price drop, it is a cause for worry for farmers. If the price keeps crashing, farmers would be forced to make distress sales, said Dey.

Bengal, said most market experts, needs high-capacity onion cold storage facilities to insulate the state’s consumers from the vagaries of supply from other states, particularly Maharashtra. With this in mind, the government has employed an investor to build a 50,000-tonne onion cold storage in Murshidabad. A similar cold storage is being planned at Balagarh in Hooghly, said agriculture department sources.

Gurung and Giri are functionaries of Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (Gurung faction) who are absconding.

Trinamool’s Lok Sabha chief whip Kalyan Banerjee said: “... He is accused of sedition, and also in the killing of a police officer... What message is BJP trying to send by standing alongside a person who is running away from law?”

Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said: “Bimal Gurung and Binoy Tamang are accused of the same offence. One is an absconder and the other is made GTA chairperson. One needs to align with Trinamool here to evade law. I also have 50 cases against me. Does that mean anything? He is our alliance partner and we will continue to meet him.”

“There is a total 29,000 cases registered against BJP leaders and workers in Bengal,” Ghosh added. “If we start counting such cases, then we cannot even step outside our homes.”

BJP’s Darjeeling MP Raju Bista said: “Similar cases were registered by police against his aides Binoy Tamang and Anit Thapa. Tamang was made GTA chief after he switched sides. How can we term anyone a convict as long as the case in pending in court?” Gurung was seen in public after almost two-and-a-half years.

1 tsp turmeric powder

1 tsp red chilli powder

1 tsp garam masala

½ tsp mustard seeds

1 tsp sesame seeds

10 curry leaves

1 pinch asafoetida

2 tbsp oil

Salt and sugar, to taste

Method:

Prepare the batter by soaking the pulses and rice for an hour and then grinding them together. The batter should be thick

Grind the tomatoes, green chillies, ginger and add this paste to the batter. At this stage you can also add a few spoons of curd, if your batter is too thick

Now add boiled vegetables, season with salt, turmeric powder, chilli powder, garam masala and sugar.

Heat the oil in a pan and add the mustard, sesame seeds, urad dal, curry leaves and asafoetida

and pour this into the batter

and mix well

Grease the dish you will be cooking the handvo in and transfer the batter into it and cook on a low flame for about 40 minutes.

If using the oven, grease and flour a bundt pan, spoon the batter into it and cook at 170 degrees for 40 minutes.

In both cooking methods, test with a skewer. if it comes out clean, it is ready.

Khandvi

Ingredients

1 cup besan (chickpea flour)

7 cups buttermilk

1 tsp turmeric powder

2 tsp oil

1 pinch asafoetida

1 tsp mustard seeds

2 tsp sesame seeds

1 tsp chilli powder

Salt, to taste

Method:

Make a smooth paste out of the besan, turmeric, asafoetida and half the buttermilk. There should be no lumps in the paste

Now, gently heat up the remaining buttermilk just till it is warm in a heavy-bottomed pan and pour in the paste. Stir continuously on a low flame to prevent lumps from forming

As the flour cooks in the buttermilk it slowly starts bubbling, changes colour and acquires a sheen.

Continue stirring for 15-20 minutes till the batter thickens. To test for readiness, dollop a spoon of the batter on a plate, let it rest for a minute or two and try rolling it. If it comes away from the plate cleanly then the batter is ready.

Pour a small quantity on to a greased plate, smoothen out into a thin pancake that is translucent. Allow to cool and dry for a few minutes, then gently roll into tight rolls.

Cut the rolls into bite sized pieces and arrange in a plate so that there is not gap between the pieces.

Repeat the last two steps till all the batter is used up.

Now heat the oil, splutter the mustard seeds in it, then add the sesame seeds and gently pour this tempering over the rolls arranged in the plate.

Finally sprinkle the chilli powder over the khandvi and its ready to serve.

On a blazing hot Sunday afternoon, we made the trip to Jignya Shah’s home in Begumpet . As we walked up the stairs to her second-floor apartment, we were worried whether our Hyderabadi Hindi would hold up while asking her all the questions we were bursting with. Born in Gujarat, Jignya moved to Hyderabad 26 years ago when she married Shreyas Shah , who is a thoroughbred Hyderabadi. When Jignya first came here, she could not imagine what she would do without her midnight sandwich from Manek Chowk or the Kesar mangoes that were the essence of summer in her childhood home of Ahmedabad. Hailing from a Jain family, she has never eaten onion or garlic, and loves her food tinged with sweetness. She wondered how she would cope with Hyderabad where onion is used as generously as the red chilli powder and where she could never get besan ki chutney (chickpea flour dipping sauce) with her fafda. “Aapko idli bina coconut chutney ke diye to kaisa lagega? (How would you feel if you were given idli without coconut chutney?)” she asks us, to clarify that besan ki chutney is as essential to the enjoyment of fafda as coconut chutney is to idli!What started as a tumultuous relationship with Hyderabad, is now one of fondness for the culture and delight in the wonderful foods that this city offers. “What is your favourite thing to eat in Hyderabad?” we ask her, and pat comes the reply with no hesitation — “idli and chutney”. Every weekend Jignya and her family get idli-chutney from a street vendor in Nallagutta, the same place they have been going to for almost two decades. “Our weekends are not complete without idli for breakfast and dosa for lunch”, her daughter Anoli chimes in. Even in their weekday breakfasts, idli, dosa, and upma make regular appearances alongside the khakra, fafda and gathiya that are the more traditional Gujarati staples. “We will go mad if we don’t eat South Indian breakfasts three times a week”, she says.The Shah family’s lunches have also been influenced by Hyderabad in that they now eat more rice than any of their relatives in Gujarat. “Jitna chawal hum ek meal mein khaate hain utna Gujarat mein teen din chalega (The quantity of rice we eat in one meal will last people three days in Gujarat)”, Jignya mentions with a giggle,remembering how every time her family goes to Ahmedabad, her relatives ensure there is always a lot of rice made as part of lunch. As we talk about lunch, Jignya leads us to the kitchen where she is going to show us how to make khandvi (a Gujarati snack, served as bite-sized rolls) and handvo (a multigrain and vegetable savoury cake). We walk into her kitchen bathed in beautiful natural light, and she shows us all the pulses and grains that were soaked and ground together into a thick batter for the handvo. While Jignya stirs vegetables and spices into the batter, she reminisces about the first time she met her husband, Shreyas, while visiting her cousin here in Hyderabad. She shares shyly how he took her out shopping on his scooter even though it was not common in their families for young men and women to interact in this way. She recalls with fondness the lovely experience it was and how she knew then that this was the man she wanted to marry. They never discussed it with each other, but when the match was proposed by Jignya’s parents, Shreyas accepted immediately. “Ek din ke liye bhi nahi socha (He did not even take a day to think about it)”, she exclaims, still shocked that he knew with such certainty that they were meant to be together.As my cynical heart melts into a puddle, Jignya has now moved on to greasing and flouring the special handvo cooker, which will have sand in the bottom of the container and the batter poured into ring mould and placed above the sand and covered to be cooked in the gentle heat released as the sand heats up. While we wait for the handvo to cook, we begin to prep for the khandvi and Jignya’s daughters open various boxes in the kitchen and have us sample homemade thepla and khakrathat are a revelation to our taste buds, which have been numbed by the insipid store-bought versions of these scrumptious snacks. They also introduce us to their treasure chest of jain masalas, everything from pasta and pizza seasoning to sizzler spices and even a masala for Maggi; all prepared without onion or garlic!Jignya sets out a heavy aluminium pan on the stove and pours in the chickpea flour and buttermilk slurry that will become the khandvi. For the next 20 minutes, she stirs the pot patiently with a whisk to prevent lumps from forming, and won’t allow us to take over despite our persistent requests to let us lend a hand. It’s a process that requires care and attention to detail, and we haven’t done enough to be worthy of her trust just yet. There is a steady rhythmic clinking of the whisk against the pan as Jignya stirs and we take the conversation back to her early days in Hyderabad and the places here that made her feel at home. She speaks fondly of Asrani Hotel on MG Road, which was one of the only places to serve Jain food in the early 90s; she mentions Mamta Sweet house in Sindhi colony where her favourite snacks are made fresh every Sunday, and the canteen in the Kulpakji temple in Aler that makes a karampodi (spiced lentil powder) without onion and garlic. Karampodi holds a special pride of place on the Shah family dining table. Shreyas says his comfort meal is plain rice, ghee and karampodi and on some days when nothing else will do! The spicy, tangy lentil powder is so beloved by the entire family that instead of chunda (sweet mango pickle), which is the traditional accompaniment to the handvo, we are presented with a small cup of karampodi with a generous spoonful of ghee drizzled over it. “Bhook lagi hai? (Hungry?)”, Jignya asks as the khandvi batter has now thickened to her satisfaction and she ladles it carefully on greased steel plates, lets it set for a few minutes and skillfully rolls the set batter into glossy rolls! We cut these rolls into bite sized pieces and arrange them in tight concentric circles, ready to be showered with a tempering of mustard and sesame seeds and sprinkled with chilli powder. We can hardly wait to seat ourselves at the table, before we reach out and grab some khandvi to pop into our mouths greedily. The luscious silkiness of the rolls perfectly complements the crunch of the sesame seeds and the gentle chilli hit. As we devour our wedges of handvo dunked in the karampodi and ghee, we revel in the textural party that this deceptively simple dish brings to our palates. Crunchy, soft, nutty, tangy; the handvo has it all.We round off our meal with a bowl of curd rice and chilled mango custard made with Jignya’s favourite Kesar mangoes. As we are about to sink into a food coma Shreyas reminisces about his first home in Hyderabad; Laxmi Building in Ramgopalpet where families from different parts of India lived together and shared their culture and cuisine. It was here that he was introduced to delightful dishes from all their homes. “Everyone was so welcoming and made sure we never felt left out, it is this feeling that symbolised Hyderabad for me,” Shreyas says, and there could not have been a better way for us to end this delightful meal.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jain-karampodi-meets-handvo-at-this-gujarati-household-in-begumpet/articleshow/74536993.cms

It also symbolizes the destruction of evil forces and a good harvest of crops. According to the Hindu calendar, the festival is held on the full moon of the month of Phalgun and is celebrated traditionally for two days. On the first day, a bonfire is lit to signify the time when Holika, Hiranyakashipu’s sister was burnt. The ceremony is called the Holika Dahan also known as Choti Holi. On the second day, which is mainly Dhulandi and Dhurdi, people celebrate the occasion with colours called gulal by smearing and spraying at each other and special songs of Holi are sung by playing the drums.Both the days of Holi including the Choti Holi is traditionally spent celebrating with family or friends and phone tucked away in a safe, waterproof place.

457,['9/03/2020'],Karnataka: Chamarajanagar priests to chant mantras in Kannada,"Chamarajanagar deputy commissioner MR Ravi

MYSURU: In a first-of-its-kind experiment in the state, the Chamarajanagar district administration has asked temple priests to recite mantras and perform rituals in Kannada to be more accessible to devotees.

A workshop will be held to train the priests of the district's 281 temples, who currently chant Sanskrit mantras, in Kannada invocations. Classified by the endowment department on the basis of the revenue they generate, two temples each fall in 'A' and 'B' categories while the remaining are under 'C'.

""Recently, I visited the Himavad Gopalaswamy temple in the district to offer prayers. I found it interesting that alongside Sanskrit, the priests were using Telugu and Tamil as well while performing puja,"" said deputy commissioner MR Ravi . ""When I asked the priests why Kannada was missing, they said there is a lack of training and learning material,"" he said.

I held a meeting with temple priests on March 3 and they said they were ready to chant Kannada mantras provided they received training. So we are planning to hold a workshop where Kannada priests like Hiremagalur Kannan of Chikkamagaluru will train their counterparts here.""

A notification issued on March 3 by the DC directed all endowmnent department officials, including executive officers of the temples, to use Kannada in puja rituals, including mantras, archane and sankalpa which are integral to any seva offering in a temple. He urged authorities to ensure that all traditions and temple practices were followed unchanged despite the change in language.

""Most devotees pray in Kannada in the temples. If the priest performs seva in the same language, devotees' familiarity with and regard for the worship will increase multifold. This is the idea behind the move to bring in Kannada in temple rituals,"" the DC said.

Devotees echoed the view, saying hearing Kannada chants will bring them closer to god. ""Such initiatives will only make our religion, rituals and customs more meaningful. In other religions too, prayers are now done in Kannada to ensure that devotees understand what is being said and done. Such reforms should continue,"" said Prasad HP.

These can accommodate around 350 patients.A senior official told TOI that the decision follows an instruction of the Railway Board. The isolation wards of Southern Railway will be able to accommodate 1,274 patients.Railways officials in New Delhi had met the Cabinet Secretary on measures to counter the threat of coronavirus. “The Railway Board directed that all zonal railways should together identify locations and create quarantine facilities with a capacity of about 20,000. Each zonal railway was directed to create facilities for at least 1,000 people. We have been asked to finish it by Monday afternoon,” a senior official said.Immediately after this, Southern Railway officials in Chennai swung into action. Instructions were given to close all training institutes and hostels and hand them over for creating quarantine facilities.The quarantine facilities will be divided into five categories in the Chennai division. These are railway wedding halls, quarters, training centres, training hostels and railway institutes. The chief project manager has been put in-charge of creating these quarantine facilities.The decision comes on the heels of a patient in Chennai testing positive for coronavirus after travelling back from Oman. He has been quarantined at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) in Chennai.Senior officials said that the Railways decision is a bit late and that they should have started this work at least a week ago as the number of passengers using trains as a transit mode is higher than those taking flights.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74543877,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-163399,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/southern-railway-wakes-up-to-coronavirus-threat/articleshow/74543616.cms

Analysts said the high fund allocation for Hyderabad and focus on infrastructure, including the Musi river front, was clear indication of Telangana government’s battle readiness plans before GHMC polls.Rao did admit a slight decline in the growth of GSDP in current prices, from 14.3% in 2018-19 to 12.6% in 2019-20, but said the percentage growth year-on-year was highest when compared to the total budget figures proposed in 2017-18 of Rs 1.43 lakh crore.The finance minister stressed there was no budget slash for any welfare measure, instead there was an increase in number of beneficiaries, signifying the TRS regime’s hope of maintaining the popularity it has been enjoying in past elections. About 70,000 more people would avail Kalyana Lakshmi scheme and its allocation was increased to Rs 2,240 crore from Rs 1,540 crore. Also, Asara pension amount was enhanced to Rs 11,750 crore from Rs 9,402 crore. Rythu Bandhu allocation was also increased Rs 14,000 crore.“Many more innovative schemes will be taken up by the government in the next financial year,” Rao said.A major allocation was for agriculture and cooperative department at Rs 24,116 crore, followed by Panchayat Raj and rural development departments at Rs 23,000 crore.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74543745,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-561197,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-kcr-govt-sticks-to-sops-bets-on-hyderabad-with-eye-on-ghmc-poll/articleshow/74543651.cms

GHAZIABAD: While Delhi-NCR is grappling with Covid-19 scare, Ghaziabad has been hit by H1N1 influenza, popularly known as swine flu.

According to health officials, three cases were reported in Indirapuram on Sunday. They said all those affected are women and they are “stable”. Meanwhile, the family members of the patients have been advised to take all precautions.

Recently, the health department had received information about six persons suffering from swine flu, after which their samples were taken for tests. Later, reports of three women were found to be positive, while the remaining three did not have swine flu. At the time of sample collection, they were all down with fever. Health officials said the three have been asked to stay at home and take medical advice.

Last year, 337 cases of swine flu were reported from the district. One person from Niwadi had lost his life. There was no case in 2018.

Meanwhile, on Sunday, swab samples of two Ghaziabad residents — one from Sanjay Nagar and another from Indirapuram — were collected for coronavirus testing. Chief medical officer NK Gupta said: “The two residents don’t have travel history. They called and informed us that they had come in contact with a person who had the virus and insisted that we collect his samples.”

We have collected 27 samples so far and 14 have been found to be negative and one was tested positive. Reports of the remaining 12 are awaited.

According to Gupta, the wife of a 57-year-old businessman from Rajnagar Extension, who was found to be suffering from coronavirus, has been tested negative. Meanwhile, the condition of the businessman admitted to RML hospital, is improving. He has bene shifted to Safdarjung hospital. Officials said the condition of the Modinagar resident, who had recently returned from Indonesia and was shifted to RML hospital on Saturday, is stable. He was discharged on Sunday.
