Coming from a small town (Jamnagar, Gujarat), it’s a big thing for me to get this exposure, and I could do all of this thanks to cricket. I am very grateful.It was a great thing for me when I found out that they had bid so much for me. My financial stability really improved after that bid. The day this news reached me, I had exactly `10 in my pocket! I was mainly bought at the base price before that season. After that season, I could take on family responsibilities and take care of all medical expenses.No. Generally, I don’t like materialistic things. I think if I’m a good human being, do good work and help people when required, I’ll be more than happy with myself. Being materialistic is not everlasting. Your greed will get the better of you. Being a good human, however, goes a long way in shaping your life.I generally buy leather shoes. I love leather products like bags, shoes etc. I try to look for a good shop where I can get these whenever I travel.Mom’s dream was for me to play for India, which really motivated me to work harder, and with passion. Unfortunately, she wasn’t with us when I played. But because of her, my passion for cricket increased. Cricket always comes first for me. My passion is still the same as it was when I was a kid. And I practise the same way as I used to earlier. But I wish my mother was around to see how well I have done – as a player and financially.Earlier, social media would affect me a lot. I didn’t know how to react when I was new in the team. I would get very disturbed. As I kept playing, I understood my abilities. Slowly, the self-doubts in my skill disappeared and I became more confident. Trolling stopped affecting me completely. My Twitter game has also improved a lot, don’t you think?I love horses. Earlier, I’d go to my friends’ farms to ride horses with them. Now, I have my own farm, and in my free time, I usually ride in my farm. I am very emotionally attached to my horses. I love spending time with them, and I feel our bonding has also improved. Wherever I am, I keep checking on my farm – whether everything is okay, are the horses looked after well, etc.The Lord’s Test was an important match to win because everyone knows the value of winning there. It was the first time I did the sword celebration. That move came to me naturally, it wasn’t pre-planned. But since I’m good at it, I think swordplay has become MY thing. Often, players in the dressing room want me to entertain them with this dance.There are many players who are witty. Virat (Kohli) is one of those, because he mimics others very well and his jokes are good. So, I think Virat.(PICS: INSTAGRAM@ROYALNAVGHAN)The biggest achievement for me is that I played for India. The most special day for me was my debut match. Coming from a small city to represent India was a big thing for me. You will lose and win many matches, but I just try to enjoy my cricket irrespective of results. I don’t play for records or think that deep. My motive is to keep enjoying the game.North Indian food is tasty but obviously not healthy. We try to avoid unhealthy food, but given a chance I love daal makhni with paratha.I’m not really sure if these guys in our team can cook! I’ve not seen any player cook. I know how to make just masala chai on my own. I try to make it at home whenever I have time.After a match, we de-stress by listening to music in the dressing room. Irrespective of the result, we do that.I like to listen to Nineties’ music. I really like Kumar Sanu ji’s songs because they had deep meaning. I like Bollywood movies with a good story. Nowadays, biopic is the new trend. Given time, I’d like to watch those as well.I don’t really have a special bucket list. I just like to explore different places and meet different kinds of people, learn their culture wherever I go. As cricketers, we get to explore different countries, and thanks to cricket, I have been able to meet different kinds of people and learn from them.Actually, Mahi bhai (MS Dhoni) had tweeted around 3-4 years ago, and since then, the ‘sir’ thing has stuck with me. Personally, I hate this title. I really dislike it when someone calls me ‘sir’. I always tell people to call me by my name, be it Jaddu or Jadeja.A professional horse riderYoung team, young cricketers so everyone is pretty fashionableSeen many crazy fans, but the one who I remember had a permanent tattoo portrait of me!

1,['15/03/2020'],Times of India,"You don’t really need rocket science to know that turmeric is good for you. It’s a universal truth, at least since the dawn of gold lattes and moonmilk. The challenge is now to crack the use of this potent spice. Nutritionists say look for one with more curcumin in it. Curcumin is the active ingredient of turmeric and scientific research shows it to have natural anti-inflammatory and anti-cancerous properties. The higher the curcumin content the more effective it will be. This is what makes Lakadong turmeric so sought-after. Indigenous to the north eastern state of Meghalaya in India, Lakadong turmeric is the real deal.Of the 11 districts of Meghalaya, Lakadong grows in a small region called Jaintia Hills and is renowned for its high curcumin content of up to 8 per cent, compared to usual varieties of turmeric with an active ingredient content of 1–3 per cent. This makes the variety of particular interest to medicine and supplement manufacturers who use higher content curcumin in their products for better efficacy. The Jaintia hills (split into east and west) produce at least three turmeric varieties – Lachein, Lakadong and Ladaw, each with its distinct identity.It must be remembered that turmeric is a warm food and therefore might not suit everyone.

Be it posing with a herby tea concoction on Instagram or signing up for a customised tea kit that gives you a morning tea to energise the body and nighttime tea to cleanse the system — tea is the new detox people are hung over. From slimming teas to herbal concoctions, is a teatox really worth the fuss? Yes, only as long as you keep the process natural and organic.Weakened immunity. “Artificial food products, flavouring, and colouring induce stress on the body, weaken body’s defence mechanism and slow down metabolism. These chemicals are also known to increase inflammation, which is commonly associated with various gastronomical illnesses. This is why detox teas have gained popularity. With naturals ingredients such as flowers, roots, herbs, and stems, these teas claim to detoxify the byproducts of various artificial products in the body and flush out the free radicals. The key lies in choosing wisely,” says Kausshal Dugarr, CEO of a well-known tea company.Another trigger for wellness teas has been the obsession with weight loss . Detox teas contain a variety of ingredients including some that claim to help with weight loss: stimulants like guarana which can contain up to four times the amount of caffeine in coffee. What people don’t realise that too much caffeine will cause issues like jitteriness and nervousness. The reason you might see a short-term dip on the weighing scale is because these teas are also dehydrating.Tea’s healing abilities have been known to mankind forever now, so why adulterate it with so called ‘detox’ ingredients? Most teatoxing kits combine tea leaves with all-natural ingredients like senna leaf, ginseng root, liquorice root, chrysanthemum, nettle leaves, psyllium seeds, cinnamon bark, cloves, rhubarb, ginger, and lemongrass. While most of these ingredients are natural, their overuse may disrupt the body’s natural rhythm.While the world goes berserk over green tea, black tea (the Chinese variety, not the English), oolong, and a tea called pu’er are also potent medicines. In fact, all herbs are medicine, whether they’re in the form of ‘tea’, infusion, tincture, or capsule. One just needs to be careful since some herbs and flowers in teas can trigger allergies. Always read the ingredients on the package before you consume a new herbal tea. Also, tea can only be medicinal and detoxifying if your diet isn’t taxing your system, which most modern meals are guilty of. “A detox tea prepared with certain herbs and spices like ginger, lime, mint leaves does help in clearing out toxins but only when combined with clean eating.

4,['15/03/2020'],You won’t get the India vibe anywhere else in the world: Alexis Kings,"British rock band Alexis Kings recently performed in the city as part of its maiden India tour. Led by vocalist Brendan Aherne, Sam Privett on guitar and Fabio Bocca on drums, the band whose first single Squire made it to the UK charts, was on a four-city tour in the country, starting with Bengaluru. One of the very few bands to not cancel its tour despite the Coronavirus scare, Alexis Kings made sure to try all things desi before heading back home. In a quick chat over chai and vada pav, Brendan spoke to us about their trip.When we think of India, we think of colourful surroundings, cultural diversity, spicy food and friendly people. You’re not going to get a similar kind of setting anywhere else. Our next song, Strawberry Blonde, will have parts of the video shot in India. We have already shot a few sequences in Mumbai and are loving the way its turning out to be. We love the vibe of Bengaluru and enjoyed a few dosas on our morning outing. I’m an Irish man, so if you give me anything made of potatoes, I’m happy. I even had a few vada pavs while shooting in Mumbai; they were absolutely amazing.I wish we had a very elaborate story behind the name (laughs). Sam and I went to school together and just came up the name, which we thought sounded cool. We started performing at pubs and then, when we joined the university together, it got a lot more serious for the two of us. We met Fabio at one such gig; he was a mutual friend’s sister’s boyfriend at the time. We needed a drummer and he chipped in for the gig, but I guess, he was here to stay.I’d say gigs, any day. We love recording and putting out our songs as well, but I think we developed ourselves as a collective only after a lot of performances, so the credit does go to a lot of gigs. Recording singles is fantastic too, but that is a tad more boring in comparison. Gigs also help you to see how the audience reacts to your new set of songs.We’ve already met up and jammed with Bollywood singer Aditya Narayan. We loved him. Rapper Badshah had some really peppy numbers. Arijit Singh has a beautiful melodious voice! With so many different kinds of music here, the audience here is more receptive than others.

5,['15/03/2020'],Is it just snoring or something more?,"Many people treat snoring as a joke or something to feel embarrassed about. But loud snoring — especially when accompanied by daytime fatigue — may be a sign of sleep apnea, a common but serious disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts as you sleep.Obstructive sleep apnea is a sleep disorder in which breathing is briefly and repeatedly interrupted during sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when the muscles in the back of the throat fail to keep the airway open, despite efforts to breathe. Another form of sleep apnea is central sleep apnea, in which the brain fails to properly control breathing during sleep. In adults, the most common cause of obstructive sleep apnea is excess weight and obesity, which is associated with soft tissue of the mouth and throat. During sleep, when throat and tongue muscles are more relaxed, this soft tissue can cause the airway to become blockedChronic snoring is a strong indicator of sleep apnea and should be evaluated by a health professional. Since people with sleep apnea tend to be sleep deprived, they may suffer from sleeplessness and a wide range of other symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, depression, irritability, sexual dysfunction, learning and memory difficulties, and falling asleep while at work, on the phone, or driving.Positive airway pressure machines, used with a variety of breathing masks, are the most widely used treatment for moderate and severe sleep apnea. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine has alsoapproved oral appliance therapy as a first line treatment for patients diagnosed with mild to moderate sleep apnea.Oral appliance therapy is an effective, non-invasive treatment that fits easily into your lifestyle.- Lose weight- Quit smoking- Avoid alcohol, sleeping pills, and sedatives- Exercise regularly-Avoid caffeine and heavy meals- Maintain regular sleep hours- Sleep on your side- Prop your head up while sleeping",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74593521,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-550273/74593521.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/health-news/is-it-just-snoring-or-something-more/articleshow/74593521.cms
6,['15/03/2020'],Friday: 14 films hit screens in Bengaluru Saturday: Theatres shut! What next?,"In response to the coronavirus threat and as a precautionary measure to stop its spread, the Karnataka government issued a directive on Friday asking all cinema halls to shut down for a week. This comes close on the heels of the Delhi government’s decision to keep all cinema halls closed till March 31, which affected films like Angrezi Medium that just hit theatres and Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar, Sir and Sooryavanshi that were targeting release dates this month. With movie halls in Kerala also shut, regional cinema in the south is looking at an uncertain future — at least for the time being. With Bengaluru accounting for a major share in terms of collections, not just for its local Kannada film industry and Bollywood, but Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Malayalam and many other regional industries also, there will be a severe dip in collections, say industry insiders.This week, for instance, Bengaluru had 14 new film releases, which included movies in Kannada, Hindi, English, Tamil, Telugu and even French. Although the government order now is only for a week’s closure, it is likely to be extended, putting the release plans of many films in disarray. The most affected, so far, were those who chose to stick with their release plans this week.Producer-distributor Karthik Gowda says, “All the films that released this week, including a few keenly-awaited Kannada titles, will have massive setbacks, given the investments they made on the release and distribution. Ideally, when movie halls reopen for business, they should be given priority to release, but that is for the Karnataka film chamber to decide.”A theatre owner from Magadi Road adds, “Since the COVID-19 scare, movie halls across the city have been operating with minimal occupancy, The government directive comes at a good time and hopefully, once we reopen, things will be back to normal and people will come to watch movies. Hopefully, the new films from this week, will be the first to release again, as they are the worst affected.” Raksh, who debuted with this week’s Naragunda Bandaya, says, “We respect the Chief Minister’s decision to prioritise the health and well-being of people above all else. Although the film had a good response in other centres, we are pulling it from movie halls across the state, until the situation gets better. We have been assured by the film chamber that our film will get priority to re-release.”After days of speculation whether the Akshay Kumar-starrer Sooryavanshi would brave the situation and stick to its original release date, March 24, its makers have now decided to push it. A statement from the team read, “Due to the recent coronavirus outbreak, we, the makers, have decided to postpone the release of Sooryavanshi, keeping in mind the health and safety of the audience. Sooryavanshi will be back when the time is right.”Tillotama Shome-starrer Sir, which was to be released on March 20, has also been postponed. Shiladitya Bora, who is spearheading the India release of the film, tweeted, “Bearing in mind public health concerns and the advisory from the health ministry, we have decided to postpone the release of Sir. We look forward to sharing the film with our home audience in India and will announce an updated release date ASAP. Meanwhile, we urge everyone to stay safe and take all necessary health precautions.”Kushka, directed by Vikram Yoganand, was supposed to hit screens on March 20. “We are deferring the release of our film to April. We had taken a hit and seen how people were scared to step out with our previous release, Ondu Shikariya Kathe. We realised that releasing a film in times of panic is a bad business decision,” says actor Nihal Rajput, who is bringing Kushka to theatres. The makers of Turtu Nirgamana have also pushed their release ahead.Director Tharun Sudhir , whose Roberrt is slated to release on April 9, says, “We are not making any announcements as of now, as we think the situation should be under control by then. There’s still close to a month’s time and things could clear up by then. However, if we do have to defer the release, we will, as it will be inevitable.”An industry insider, on the basis of anonymity, maintained, “Rumours in industry circles is that given the situation in Kerala and Karnataka, Vijay’s much-anticipated film Master may have to look at a new release date. If the theatres remain shut beyond April first week, the team will have to reconsider, since Karnataka and Kerala are major market players for them. This is purely speculative,though, as of now.”Sanjay Suri, who’s involved with the India release of the French film Les Miserables, which also hit theatres this weekend, had earlier stated, “We shall wait for the situation to improve and see if a phase-wise release is possible when the shutdown is lifted. Safety is most important.”The spread of coronavirus and the resulting shutdown in places like Delhi, Karnataka and Kerala will also affect the business of films that were released in the previous weeks. Yogesh Raizada of Wave Cinemas says, “Had the occupancy in cinema halls not dipped last week because of the coronavirus scare, Baaghi 3 would have done even better.” Ahmed Khan, director of Baaghi 3, says, “The safety of the audience is extremely important. We would never want their lives to be at risk. It’s unfortunate that the theatres in Delhi will be shut for a while now and that will affect the overall collections of my film, but some things are beyond our control. We must follow what the government bodies decide.”Anubhav Sinha, whose directorial Thappad is also still in cinemas, says, “Thappad has completed 80% of its run at the box office. Delhi contributes about 15% to the collections. That will be impacted but we have to live with it because logon ki jaan se badhkar kuch nahi hota. But we should not panic because that can just make the situation more difficult to handle. Apart from pulling down shutters of theatres in Delhi, governments across states and UTs need to educate people about this disease.”— With inputs from Niharika Lal and Rachana Dubey",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74626184,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-210354/74626184.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/friday-14-films-hit-screens-in-bengaluru-saturday-theatres-shut-what-next/articleshow/74626220.cms

8,['15/03/2020'],Time for lip service?,"You just have to scroll through Instagram to see how everyone – from celebs to beauty influencers are proudly owning and displaying full lips. From beauty czarina Kylie Jenner to your local beauty blogger, everyone is pouting away to glory. The scope of getting the perfect pout is huge – from subtle pillowy lips to exaggerated volume. If you are smitten by the plump pout trend but want to steer clear of invasive methods, check these ideas.Exfoliation is not for your face and body alone, your delicate lips need it as much. “Exfoliating your lips increases circulation, helping blood to rush to your lips to make them look fuller. Use a soft toothbrush to scrub away dry, flaky skin, leaving the fresh skin underneath,” advises aromatherapist Blossom Kochhar. Or scrub it with a blend of powdered sugar and honey to remove traces of dryness or flaky skin. Keep it moisturised with a hydrating lip oil or balm – it helps in defining the pout and gives an illusion of fullness. Beauty blogger Manavi Siddhanti has a tip: “If you have naturally thin lips, using lip balms with hyaluronic acid (the key ingredient used in fillers by dermatologists) will help in achieving some fullness.” Kochhar emphasises on picking lip balms with ultra-hydrating products like beeswax, coconut oil, shea butter and essential oils.Apparently, kitchen ingredients can work as lip volume enhancers. Most of the plumpers available with beauty brands contain spices like cayenne pepper, cinnamon and liquids like olive oil, glycerin, peppermint oil as active ingredients. These balms/gloss give a temporary pout that’s not as in-your-face as a lip-enhancing surgery.Take an ice cube from the freezer and hold it onto your lips; the coldness from the ice activates the sensory neurons in your lips and makes them slightly bigger than its real shape. Follow up with a nice lipstick or gloss. This temporary pout lasts for 4-6 hours.The safest non-surgical method used in aesthetic clinics for accentuated lips are hyaluronic acid-based fillers that are FDA approved for lip enhancement, definition as well as hydration. “Generally the result of hyaluronic acid fillers last up to a year. It is a safe technique that gives long-lasting results. Nowadays, these advanced fillers procedures are painless and it takes only 10-15 minutes,” says dermatologist Dr Navin Taneja.Hydrate the skin around your lips too with coconut or almond oil.Lines or dryness in thatarea makes lips seemless plumpLip enhancers, aka plastic plumpers, are available online for temporary fullness. Check videos online to know how to use itTake 1 tsp white butter or cream and add 1 drop of cinnamon essential oil to it. Apply it regularly to your lips. You might feel a tingling sensation that will go away within few minutes. Cinnamon creates a temporary swollen look and butter offers deep hydration. Do this 2-3 times a week and you will notice your lips getting plumper.NOTE: Do a patch test under your ears to check for allergies to cinnamon— Blossom Kochhar, AromatherapistDisclaimer: Before trying out any lip-enhancement treatement or even OTC product, it’s best to consult an expert- Pallavi Shankar",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74593116,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-86511/74593116.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/beauty/time-for-lip-service/articleshow/74593054.cms
9,['15/03/2020'],Eating on the fly,"by Pooja MakhijaConsulting Nutritionist & Clinical DieticianIn part one last week, we addressed the disruption that work travel brings with it, and what I find to be the most common health mistakes people make. Topping the list was missing breakfast, drinking too little water, drinking too much alcohol, and skipping exercise altogether. In a perfect world, while the obvious solution would be to do all of these things well, travel is not a conducive environment to do any of these things. This is where small, incremental changes work wonders.Like most things, staying healthy starts in the mind: if you start a work trip with the intention of being healthy, chances are you’ll be far more successful ending it that way. And like most things, the devil is in the detail. Even minor changes in your approach can have far reaching results. Small change, big lose. Here’s how you can think small for big results:Eat Protein with Every MealWhether it’s pulses, eggs (whites preferable), lean meats like chicken, fish or seafood, or even alternative options like quinoa, protein not only helps your brain to think more clearly, but also keeps you fuller for longer.Take a Water BottleOne of the easiest things to access, water is your best friend on work trips. Sip your way to better concentration, better body function and a smaller appetite.Eat in smaller burstsLong meetings are unavoidable, but not even the meanest boss can deny you a loo break. It’s the best time to pop those quick, healthy foods hidden away in your pocket like almonds, raisins and roasted chana. While the ideal is to eat every two hours, healthy snacks between meals can boost your concentration, your metabolism and also prevent overeating at dinner. To that end, you could also......Pack small snacksIf nuts aren’t your thing, you could also carry healthy crackers, puffed rice, fresh fruit and other small, compact healthy snacks. These will also help you to......Say no to sugarTheir empty calories notwithstanding, eating sugary foods is the worst thing you can do to your body on a work trip. This is because sugar spikes your body’s blood sugar levels only sending them crashing down, leaving you exhausted and unable to focus.Choose a hotel with a gymEven 15 minutes on a treadmill can work wonders for brain clarity and stress management. And if you absolutely cannot make time, eschew the company car for a walk. As with most exercises, the point is to move as much as you can, as often as you can.Drink lessApart from the unnecessary calories that alcohol brings, it has rarely worked to a professional’s advantage to be tired and dehydrated the next day.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74593188,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-193955/74593188.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/diet/eating-on-the-fly/articleshow/74593188.cms

With so much ‘pop self-help’ available, the human tendency is to reach for quick fix after quick fix, hoping something will do it for you.And the irony is that overconsumption of “bettering yourself” can defeat its purpose.Business coach Sanjeet Rya explains how. “Everyone is a Milkha Singh in the race of self-improvement, alas, without a goalpost. We are just running aimlessly,” he says.It’s time to stop and think. Where am I running to? What am I running for? If it’s worth what I am losing today… There has to be a solid reason to optimise the self, believes Rya. He adds, “Improvement is a great thing. But the real problem lies when the same is done for the wrong reasons. For example, if you are trying to improve or learn something to be better than everyone else, it’s the rat race that has no end. And since you will never be able to achieve it, you are designing for failure and unhappiness. But if you are doing the same to be a better version of yourself and to explore your true potential, then that’s amazing.”Survival in the hypercompetitive, globalised economy, where workers have fewer protections and are more disposable than ever, requires that we try to become faster, smarter, and more creative. Hence, we are forever setting a goal-list.But it’s getting exhausting. Life coach Farzana Suri says, “The need for constant improvement is leaving most of us, especially millennials, in a constant state of dissatisfaction. Since we are never satisfied and only running from one goalpost to another, the internal stress has reached its peak.”Our high expectations and critical self-evaluation and feelings of inadequacy stoke the obsession to improve. Not to forget how social media is forcing us to attain the poster girl/boy status. Self-improvement feeds on our insecurities. How many of us really like ourselves?New York Times bestselling author Sarah Knight’s book, You Do You, has a chapter titled: There is Nothing Wrong with You. In an interview to The globalmail.com, she says, “If you insist on making one resolution – it must be to accept yourself for who you are; not to beat yourself up over what you are not (e.g., thin enough, rich enough, stylish enough, in-a-relationship-enough). You’ll get more out of cultivating confidence and swagger than by enumerating all the ways in which you’re deficient – by your own impossibly high standards or anyone else’s.”Knight explains she’s not against goals per se, just the ornamental solutions that pop out everywhere these days which are supposed to solve all our lives’ great dilemmas.Author Sudha Menon says the biggest fallout of “constant improvement” is the death of everything that is spontaneous, natural and organic within us. “There is no scope for impulse, no room for the average and no letting down the guard so we can be plain old us!” Menon should know. She was on a self-improvement treadmill for the best part of my forties wanting to be the “best version of myself”. She adds, “All I actually became was a stressed out version of myself. Now, when I set out to learn something new, it’s because I want to do it not because it is fashionable.”",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74593097,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-133195/74593097.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/de-stress/in-pursuit-of-constant-self-improvement/articleshow/74593076.cms
11,['15/03/2020'],"Shwetha Menon: Shwetha Menon : I believe that till date, I have not performed any challenging roles","Doing bold roles has been a hallmark of Shwetha Menon ’s career. In real life too, she has been a person with strong opinions. The actress, who is now settled in Mumbai with her husband and daughter, was recently in Thiruvananthapuram. She tells us about her new movie Badal directed by Ajayan, doing bold characters and more:I listen to scripts every month. But often I wonder whether many of them fit me right, or whether they have visualised me as the character well enough (laugh). I pick whatever I like. I don’t look for unique or special characters. I like to be pampered and remain in my comfort zone, and I’m not too keen to do out-of-the-box roles though I don’t mind taking risks at times.Badhal is a Malayalam film by newbie director Ajayan . But he is a talented theatre person and has a clear vision about the film. The project came my way around the time I felt I needed a change.I play Kanimozhi, who is a naxalite, and the film offers me a new subject. I wanted to understand about Maoists, their protests, history and the like better and this film helped me with the same. A few people belonging to certain tribes in Kerala helped me get the character’s language right. Ajayan is the one who persuaded me to do the film and used to tell me, ‘Shwethaji, you should do this film, you are theonly one who can play Kanimozhi.’ We took around three years to complete its shoot.We shot mostly in Attappadi, Munnar and Palakkad. We travelled across the water bodies and forests of the State to shoot the film.There were leeches, bugs and more to face and the terrain was challenging as well. But it was quite an adventure. The role was also tough, but I followed Ajayan’s instructions to get it right.Honestly, I never picked roles depending on how different they were. I guess they came to me because of my ‘why not try it’ attitude. The difference in roles were brought about on the film’s location. I don’t take credit for any of the films either, I have just performed as instructed by the directors. I believe that till date, I haven’t performed any challenging roles.I remember I signed Ozhimuri while doing Salt and Pepper, and then I wasn’t married. The shoot started much later, after my marriage and while I was six and a half months pregnant. I could get its character Kaliamma’s body language right as I could only walk like that, with the baby in my womb. But it helped the character! It was long ago, while we were shooting for Badal that Naval Enna Jewel’s director Renji Lal Damodaran met me and said, ‘You will be the lead in my film and you will be playing a man.’ I thought, ‘Is this man mad?’ (laughs). But eventually I shed 15 kg to get his body language right and did the film. What I mean to say is that all my roles came to me like this, organically.Yes. And it’s the Malayali audience who gave me the courage to take risks and make the best of my opportunities. They critique you a lot, but if women-centric films have good stories, they accept them as well. Only Malayalam audience welcome good films of all languages. I feel that regardless of whether the film is woman-centric or not, our audience always accept good films.Other than Badal, there is another film too in the making. I am also a judge in the celebrity dance show Surya Jodi No 1, alongside actress Miya and Prasanna master.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74628439,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-195144/74628439.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/shwetha-menon-i-believe-that-till-date-i-have-not-performed-any-challenging-roles/articleshow/74628298.cms

So, I’ve been his fan since childhood. I developed this habit of drawing Superstar’s pictures from my brother M Moorthy. Seeing him draw pictures, I used to do the same in my school notebook during class hours. One day, I was caught by my teacher, but instead of punishing me, she praised me for my sketch and said I should improve my skills so that I can become an artist. I took it as a piece of life advice and started drawing things other than Superstar, but I was recognised by the people of my native, Madurai, for my sketches of Rajini sir. My whole life started with paintings of Superstar and today, he is the reason behind my livelihood as fans in the city dial me whenever they need his portrait.After seeing my interview in a news channel, I got a call from Thalaivar’s office inviting me to Chennai, but I didn’t know I was going to meet Rajini sir. They instructed me to come with my family and told me to feel free and ask if I needed any monetary help for my daughter’s studies. I took a train to Chennai with my daughter and wife, and we took an auto to his residence. Superstar’s assistant told me to wait in a room and said a person will come and I could share my grievances with them and hand over the painting I had drawn of Thalaivar. I never expected Rajini sir himself to storm into the room. He came like fire into the room with his trademark stylish walk that no one can match and I stood frozen for a moment. I felt as if my life’s purpose had been fulfilled. I kissed his feet and cried for a minute in happiness as I got a chance to see Thalaivar in his residence with my family. Seeing my crazy response, my wife, S Selvi, gave me a disapproving look. Thalaivar noticed my wife’s reaction and reassured her, saying, “All this madness is nothing but love and affection. I am blessed to get fans like Sundar.” Then, we took photos with him while he appreciated me for my artworks. If you observe a die-hard Rajini fan, you will find some of Thalaivar’s character and mannerism ingrained in them. I tried to control myself from imitating him, but failed in front of him. He smiled seeing my attempt and hugged me for a moment. I have never seen a star with such simplicity. My desire is that I must die while drawing his portrait.The first Superstar picture that I drew was a still from Adhisaya Piravi (1990). In that still, Superstar will be seen holding a mace in his hand and a cigarette on his lips. My most favourite work is a portrait of a still from Thalapathy that I drew in 1991. It was a silhouette of the Superstar with his head tilted a little. The red-and-black colour combination along with his cool hairstyle enhance namma Style Mannan’s charisma. It is a picture that I will cherish forever.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74626838,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-694435/74626838.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/fan-moment-thalaivar-came-into-the-room-like-fire-and-i-stood-frozen-says-m-sundar/articleshow/74626838.cms
15,['15/03/2020'],Weddings affected as CM puts the brakes on big fat events,"‘Weddings being scaled down’

‘Perishable items lead the revenue loss’

‘If the situation persists for a month or more, the industry will collapse’

My family and I are based abroad and were planning to travel to India for my wedding. However, with the coronavirus outbreak, keeping everyone’s health in mind, we have postponed the wedding indefinitely. We will resume planning once the outbreak has been resolved,” says Sanaya* (name changed) who was to get married in Bengaluru in early April. Sanaya, as it turns out, is not the only one whose big plans were scuttled due to the pandemic. On Friday, the state government ordered the shutting down of malls, cinema halls, pubs, schools and colleges, summer camps, exhibitions and all other mass gathering events across the state for one week starting from March 14. The government advised people against organising events that will see large footfalls, like weddings, with the guest line up not to exceed 100, for nuptials that were scheduled for the week. Beside the couples and their immediate families, what does a move like this mean for the others involved, like caterers, event organisers and wedding planners?Wedding planner Chitra Aiyappa, who runs SHUBOOS Floral’s, Weddings & More, shares that while engagements have been postponed, few weddings that were scheduled for the weekend and the days ahead, are going ahead as planned but on a more subdued note. “Clients are choosing to scale down events, in order to adjust to the directive. They understand that the move is in the interest of the public, so they are trying to salvage whatever possible in the current situation. They are foregoing elaborate settings and choosing to have very few people in attendance,” Chitra explains.Yasir Siraj, who runs Avenues Weddings & Events, shares that some of his clients have panicked and either rescheduled their big days or postponed it indefinitely. “That is perfectly okay, but the bigger problem is that a lot of perishable material had already been procured or booked for these events,” says Yasir, adding, “For instance, we block floral vendors at least a month or 20 days in advance, not just to get the exact variety that the client is looking for, but also to ensure availability at a reasonable price. Perishable items and decor material that cannot be resused, as well as the labour charges that have already been paid for are where it is going to hurt us most, monetarily. For weddings scheduled in May or thereafter, we still have the leeway to work things around and figure out a plan of action. But the ones taking place in March or April is where business will be most hit. We are speaking to clients to minimise losses and figure out economical ways to reschedule.”Pankaj Kothari, who runs Sagar Caterers at Gayatri Vihar, says the situation looks bleak for the catering industry, with regard to recovering losses. “This business runs primarily on daily wage-workers under our employment. Even if employers manage to pull through, workers will struggle to meet their everyday needs. We do understand that business interests cannot be put above a threat to human life. But the sad reality is that in case the outbreak is not resolved in a month or two, the industry will collapse. We hope that the issue is resolved soon,” he shares.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74626083,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-147820,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/weddings-affected-as-cm-puts-the-brakes-on-big-fat-events/articleshow/74626083.cms

Every generation tends to consider itself the master of trends that they think are new and novel. This year, with a push for sustainability in everything, the key trend is to reinvent decor with smart, green ideas. In January, at the Pune Design Week, one of the most popular workshops was the Bamboo Makers Space on how bamboo was being innovated into home decor products. At the London Design Festival, a showcase called Bamboo Futures had Bali-based designer Elora Hardy and her team at Ibuku construct sustainable bamboo buildings across the world, with every building devised using a bamboo model.Nripal Adhikari and Lance Rake conceptualised the Habre eco bike made by local artisans using regional bamboo. The bike aims to provide a green alternative to gas-guzzling vehicles, reducing air pollutants and therefore improving the health of citizens. A lot of sculpture artists too are now working with bamboo. From bamboo chikhs, photo frames, bookshelves to bamboo flowers to bamboo in spas and homes for healing – it is ‘the’ favourite material in home decor. In the patio and garden, bamboo planters are stealing the show, while bamboo candle-stands are used to give a unique look to a corner.Feng shui experts also believe putting bamboo in the home enhances the chances of good luck and wellbeing. In the current Year of the Rat, bamboo decor is extremely healing and lucky. Feng shui expert SBS Surendran says, “Growing two bamboo sticks brings love, three stalks bring long life, eight stalks are for motivation, and nine bring fortune. Bamboo plants have the power to ward off negativity by attracting positivity from the surroundings and emitting tranquility and peace. The plant absorbs the bad energies from the surroundings and makes the environment more pleasant and harmonious.”In Lachen in Sikkim, the town authorities have introduced bamboo water bottles to cut down on plastic wasteWALK THE STALK",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74591841,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-172594/74591841.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/home-garden/bamboo-zled/articleshow/74591700.cms
17,['15/03/2020'],Get a pup/dog only if you are a responsible enough...,"People sometimes adopt a pup thinking, How adorable? or My children want one or simply because the particular breed is exotic and a ‘status symbol’. Little do they realise that keeping a dog requires hard work and one needs a tremendous amount of patience and time. Once the ‘honeymoon period’ with the pup is over, the pup is neglected terribly or abandoned! Here are a few basic points to know whether you deserve a pet at all...A pup is a family member and requires undivided attention. Make sure you are ready to give love, care, affection, and attention.Analyse this: Do you really need a pup? A pup requires a lot of time, love and care, and a lot of money will have to be spent on your pet. Don’t adopt dogs because your children or you find them cute. When you get exposed to the hard work and non-stop antics, you may want to give up. Think hard. Don’t adopt till you’re sure that you are up for all the hard work.Getting a puppy just because your friend or relative has one isn’t good enough. Also, do not go for a popular breed. Select a breed that suits your home, environment and weather conditions.I have seen a case where a dog was not bathed for more than 10 months. When I pointed it out, they sent their dog to the spa with the driver just to display how much they care! If they would have cared, the poor dog would have been well groomed.Like any family member, your pet should be taken for general health check-ups and vaccines regularly.Seasonal changes: Take care of your dog’s needs and requirements as seasons change. Make sure they keep cool in summers and are well-wrapped in winters.Clean water at all times: Provide them with clean drinking water all the time.Place for a nap: Give them a proper bed to sleep in, with extra bedding in winters.Talk to your pet: I have seen people who never talk to their dog, never give them a pat on their back and the weirdest of all, don’t touch them. If you feel that way, don’t keep a dog.Let them roam free: A dog’s place is in the house – everywhere and your heart. Imagine spending the afternoon in the open in the summer months or facing the December winds at night. You are torturing your dog by doing the same. It’s a common sight to see dogs in the balcony, the outhouse or tied up near the parking spot – that’s inhuman!Track health details: Some pet parents don’t keep track of vaccines and regular health check-ups of their pets. Health details in general and all check-up records should be maintained properly.Play with them: Play is work and exercise for a dog. Walk with them, talk to them and have fun. It’s a great bonding exercise.Ben Williams said: “There is no psychiatrist in the world like a puppy licking your face.” Indulge in a game of ‘FETCH’ and a cuddle-up session with your pet. Till you’ve tried it, you don’t get to know that dogs can literally bring down your stress levels and blood pressure.www.dogsandpupsmagazine.com;www.facebook.com/DogsandpupsmagAre you a proud petparent?

20,['15/03/2020'],Eat. Write. Share.,"Do you want to hear the story of the first time that I had the Mumbai working man’s staple, the misal pav?That was in 1997, at the office of the market research agency (Mumbai) where I had been sent to on a training stint from Kolkata. I had started a new phase of my life. I had just transitioned from being a student and had joined the proverbial rat race. My first time alone in a city too. There was the excitement of discovery at one hand... a newfound sense of freedom. And then there were many moments of emptiness and feeling lost.On a desultory morning at my desk that day, came in the office canteen boy carrying a tray topped with bowls of misal and a stack of pav.I was not really hungry but decided to order a portion of this strange-looking dish to quell my sense of ennui. There seemed to be a version of what I would call chanachoor in Kolkata, topped on what looked like what we called ghoogni back home. Since then, I have learnt that ‘misal’ means mixture and that while the sprouts and moth bean version I had that day is more common in Mumbai, there are other mixes too. That the levels of chilli heat in each can vary. And that once you go to Pune, they might serve it to you with slices of white bread and not pav.What I do remember from that day is how the familiar crunchiness of farsan brightened my day and made me feel very at home – as did dunking the pav in the misal and seeing it soak in the gravy. It reminded me of the pound ruti (small local bakery loaves) with the ghoogni in Promod da’s canteen in Presidency College. Feeling alive once again, I switched on the Walkman and got back to transcribing notes from a focus group conducted among housewives on bathroom cleaners.There are various approaches that one can take to write about the misal pav. One can share traditional recipes from across Maharashtra. Or of new age restaurant interpretations of it. Talk about history of the dish. The nutritional value of the combination. Or, you can write your personal misal story.The idea of sharing this was to help address the questions of those who want to write about food but are not sure where to start. The Times Kitchen Tales movement is based on the stories that you share. We look forward to them eagerly.Food stories do not have to be just about the exotic or the unknown. Please do not feel constricted by your wait for the elusive ‘breaking news’. The stories of everyday food, written in the style of a ‘diary-ist as Ruskin Bond puts it, can be quite the goldmine.What might seem mundane for you can paint a vivid picture of our nation as it stands today to many. And where should you start?Imagine that there you are narrating a story to someone sitting in front of you and the rest will flow. Forget that there will be someone who will read what you wrote later and you will not worry about whether you will be judged. Use language that you are comfortable with and write about what you have experienced; for pretending to be who we are not makes for a weak plot.This week’s exercise: Please write to us at www.timeskitchentales.com in 400 to 600 words about the first time you tried an Indian dish that was unfamiliar to you, which has become your favourite since then.How can you be a part of this?

22,['15/03/2020'],ATK edge Past Chennaiyin 3-1 for third Indian Super League title,"Margao: ATK ended Chennaiyin FC’s fairytale run this season and scripted one of their own as they became the first team to win the Indian Super League ( ISL ) trophy for the third time in just six years.

Both finalists had won the trophy twice in the past, and at the empty Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Saturday, it were ATK who had the final laugh with a deserving 3-1 victory.

Javier Hernandez kept his best for the last as the Spaniard scored a fine brace to help ATK emerge triumphant. The former Real Madrid midfielder scored his first goal of the season to put ATK ahead in the 10th minute and then sealed the match in added time after rounding off goalkeeper Vishal Kaith. Edu Garcia had scored his sixth goal of the season just three minutes after restart to put ATK 2-0 up, while Nerijus Valskis led Chennaiyin’s fightback with a strike in the 68th minute.

It was coach Antonio Habas’ second title with ATK after steering them to success in the inaugural edition. But Chennaiyin coach Owen Coyle and his side can take some accolades too for fighting their way to the final after winning just one of their first six matches.

Played behind closed doors for fear of coronavirus, Habas showed faith in the same starting 11 that rallied in the second leg playoff which saw defending champions Bengaluru FC being knocked out. On the other hand, Coyle made one change to his side that lost 2-4 against FC Goa at the same venue, but still went through with a 6-5 aggregate win. Germanpreet Singh started ahead of Edwin Vanspaul to partner Anirudh Thapa at the heart of an all-Indian midfield which also included Laldinliana Renthlei.

Chennaiyin showed urgency to score first and came close twice. Pritam Kotal was forced to clear Andre Schembri’s effort on the goalline while Valskis saw his effort hit the horizontal from inside the box.

Just when it looked like Chennaiyin were taking control, the game drifted towards ATK. John Johnson found Roy Krishna on the right and the joint top scorer crossed it perfectly for Hernandez, who buried his half volley to the ground as the ball bounced in front of Kaith and found the top corner.

Kaith soon denied Krishna from close and the rebound fell to Hernandez, only for Laldinliana to deny the Spaniard with a crucial save.

ATK were jolted in the 38th minute when Krishna was forced out due to injury. But Garcia made sure ATK did not lose their grip in the second half. The Spaniard combined well with David Williams, breezed into the box, before his deft placement hit the far post and rolled inside, two minutes after restart.

Valskis threw Chennaiyin a lifeline when he met a cross from Lallianauala Chhangte for his 15th goal in the league. But ATK survived the remaining minutes with Habas making defensive additions in the form of Pronay Halder and Victor Adeva.

In added time, it was Pronay who won the ball in midfield and made space for Hernandez with an overhead ball to do the rest.

There was nobody in the stands to celebrate, but take nothing away from ATK’s deserving triumph.

23,['15/03/2020'],"ISL final: Police, masks, sanitisers and empty stands","Margao: The unusual presence of such a large posse of policemen took many by surprise.

The Indian Super League ( ISL ) final between Chennaiyin FC and ATK was supposed to be played behind closed doors. But when accredited officials and registered media reached the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Saturday, the policemen caught their eye.

There were many of them outside the VIP gate. Some were relaxed, while most others were alert, wearing masks that are meant to protect them against the deadly coronavirus. Why so many policemen were around for a game that could officially have less than 200 people remained a surprise.

Just like the cops, masks were unmistakable at Fatorda.

The security officials who frisked you at the gate and checked your bags for anything untoward didn’t want to take any chance. Almost all of them wore masks, and anyone who entered the stadium had to first use the hand sanitiser before moving ahead.

At the media tribune, the most crowded area at the stadium with approximately 30 journalists, it wasn’t any different. Team lineups were next to hand sanitisers. There was even a medical kiosk, just in case of emergency.

The stadium, though, was largely quiet. You got that empty feeling. Not surprising because fans were not allowed. When the Chennaiyin team bus made their way inside the stadium, there were a handful of travelling fans who made their presence felt. But when the match kicked off, the players were on their own.

There was no cheering. The 20-odd officials per team who were provided accreditation for the final and allowed to watch the game from the VVIP enclosure tried their best. They cheered loudly. Even Bollywood actor and Chennaiyin co-owner Abhishek Bachchan joined them.

The VVIP enclosure largely had wives and girlfriends of players. There was ATK striker Roy Krishna’s wife, and in the same row there was Mrs Garcia. Had it not been for a cancellation of visa while she was on her way to India from Australia, even David Williams’ wife would have been here.

It must have been strange for the players. They were playing the most important match of the season, and there was nobody to cheer them. Players like Arindam Bhattacharya – voted Man of the Match for his spectacular performance under the ATK horizontal – and Pritam Kotal never fail to call their mothers before a game. How they must have loved to see them at the stadium after winning the ISL trophy.

“It’s a different feeling (without spectators at the stadium). I was talking to the players (before the game) and trying to motivate them. Without an atmosphere (at the stadium), they had to be encouraged, motivated. We have a big problem across the world with coronavirus. Tackling that is more important than football ,” said ATK coach Antonio Habas.

When Javier Hernandez scored the opening goal for ATK, he tried to look for appreciation from the stands and got nothing in return. Instead, it were his teammates who mobbed him. When the referee blew the final whistle, the players first celebrated among themselves and then walked up below the VVIP enclosure and danced away to glory.

Surely, they missed the support from the stands. They missed the adulation. They missed the irreplaceable noise. Like Habas said, this final had an unusual feel to it.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/police-masks-sanitisers-and-empty-stands/articleshow/74632722.cms
24,['15/03/2020'],Boumous is ISL’s best player,"Margao: FC Goa ’s Hugo Boumous was the unanimous choice for the Indian Super League ’s best player award.

The French midfielder was outstanding for Goa throughout the season and helped them top the league stages. After finishing on top, FC Goa became the first Indian club to seal a berth in the AFC Champions League next season.

With the final at Nehru Stadium in Fatorda, side FC Goa were missed, but there was some consolation for the player who won plenty of hearts with his goals and assists.

“I really appreciate the award. I put in a lot of hard work all through the season, but it would have best if our team could reach the final,” Boumous said in his video message which was played at the stadium.

Hugo also won the Winning Pass of the League award. The 24-year-old, now into his third season for FC Goa, played 16 matches this season, scoring 11 goals and 10 assists to his credit. Hugo was even close to matching his teammate and star striker Ferran Corominas’ 14-goal tally this season.

FC Goa were the most impressive team in the league with their attacking brand of football. But Clifford Miranda ’s side missed their best player for the first leg semifinal against Chennaiyin FC due to injury.

His absence left a huge void, along with Brandon Fernandes in midfield, as FC Goa were stunned 1-4 in Chennai. Hugo returned in the home clash, but lasted only 20 minutes as he was forced out due to the recurring groin injury.

Boumous has another two years left on his existing contract and will return next season for another stint at the club.

The official, who the police only identified as Bhushan , was found to be in possession of charas while he was entering the stadium through the VIP gate.

“He was frisked at the gate and drugs were found. He has been brought to the police station and an offence is being registered against him,” a senior police official from the Fatorda police station told TOI late on Saturday.

While Chennaiyin FC said the official was not one of their own, sources said he was working for an external agency that was hired by the ISL finalists. Chennaiyin FC lost the final 1-3 against ATK.

The ISL final was played behind closed doors due to fears over coronavirus. Only accredited officials and registered media were granted access inside the Nehru Stadium.

31,['15/03/2020'],Firangi para loses its mojo as last of the tourists head back home,"‘Our country is devastated, we are needed back home’

‘Business has suffered like never before’

‘Kolkata is a welcoming city’

From March 13 midnight, India shut its door to all foreign nationals till April 15 in a bid to curb the spread of the dreaded coronavirus . Though Bengal is yet to report any positive cases or impose restrictions, the impact of the extraordinary measures is evident in the deserted alleys of Sudder Street and Marquis Street. The usual bustle was missing at Kolkata’s quintessential firangi paras, with the last of the tourists and backpackers heading back home.The spark was missing at Sudder Street’s otherwise lively tourist community. Alison and Ian — British tourists from Manchester, who have been travelling all over south India for weeks — are in Kolkata now while preparing to leave on Tuesday. “It is the same scene there, isn’t it?” said Alison. “Am I scared? No. I am uncomfortable…. A little less than scared,” she added with a weak smile.Meanwhile, a bunch of Spanish travellers, two nurses — Elena and Andrea, and two doctors — Beatriz and Anna, have rescheduled their departure date. “The Spanish government requested us to return. Perhaps a few days later we cannot go back,” said Elena. After wrapping up their work here in Kolkata, they were supposed to visit Varanasi, Jaipur and Agra, and then finally leave India on March 21. However, they cut short their trip and took a flight back to Spain on Saturday. “Our country is really devastated now. Perhaps when we go back, it will need us,” said Elena.Local pubs are empty. Even coffee shops and roadside retail shops present a sorry picture. “No less than 200 stays have been cancelled in the last eight days in my hotel. A group of four Italian tourists just cancelled their booking as they had to leave from Delhi,” said Surinder Singh of Galaxy Hotel. “If things go on like this, in another three to four days, I am anticipating 75% empty rooms. I am in this business for 15 years and withstood recessions and other calamities. I have never seen anything like this before,” added Surinder, whose hotel has 34 rooms and a six-bed dorm, catering largely to foreigners.Raj Spanish Café that is usually seen brimming with foreign nationals looked despondent. “There is a 70-80% drop in the number of customers. On any other Friday, there is no room to sit and today we only have Indian customers. Only those who are yet to leave Kolkata are here,” said the manager Nagendranath Pal.“My parents think I am safer here,” joked Esperanza Ortiz , who came from Andalusia, Spain, where all the schools and universities are shut after the coronavirus outbreak. “I am not worried about myself. But I am worried about my father, who is there. He is old. And elderly people are at bigger risk than I am,” she said as she took a drop of hand sanitiser kept at the doorway of a hotel in Sudder Street. Esperanza was supposed to leave by the end of April. But now things are abit uncertain.Another French group for four, Clara, Hortense, Bernard and Marguerite, who came to Kolkata to offer social service, are worried about their homeland. “Paris is in crisis. Schools, colleges, shopping malls, theatres are all shut down. Just to give you an example, a small bottle of 75 ml hand sanitiser that in normal time costs around €2 and €3 are now selling for €30. This is bizarre,” said Clara.Bernard, who came recently, said, “I saw the panic in airports. I have a visa for 90 days as we were supposed to go to Nepal and Rajasthan, but I don’t think that is happening now. Some airlines will be suspending flights, we heard.” Meanwhile, Marguerite revealed that they had a good time in Kolkata. “This is a welcoming city. We played Holi last week.

While we have seen several memes on social media where ‘corona’ has been used in Bollywood film titles for humour, we have learnt that a movie title has actually been registered, giving a funny twist to the Hrithik Roshan’s 2000 release, superhit film Kaho Naa… Pyaar Hai. It is Eros International that has gone ahead and registered Corona Pyaar Hai as a film title.A source from IFTPC (Indian Film and Television Producer Council) informed that Eros International registered Corona Pyaar Hai as their film title last week. When we contacted producer Krishika Lulla , she confirmed the news saying, “Currently the scripting is going on. The subject (of the epidemic) is going to be set in a love story. Currently, we are fine tuning the script and are waiting for things to subside, as things have come to a standstill now. Once everything is normal, we will start the project in full swing.”Another film body, IMPPA (Indian Motion Picture Producers' Association) too confirms that they have also witnessed film producers rushing in to register corona based film titles. “We have already registered one called Deadly Corona,” informed a source.Even in the past it has been seen that filmmakers have made a beeline to get titles registered based on real life events and catastrophes. At the time when Article 370 was revoked, film associations had reportedly received requests for registering titles - Article 370, Kashmir Hamara Hai, Article 370 Abolished, Kashmir Mein Tiranga and more like these. Similarly, following the Pulwama terror attack and the Balakot air strike titles like Abhinandan, The Air Strike Of Pulwama, India Strikes Back, Surgical Strike 2.0 were quickly registered by filmmakers keen on making movies on these subjects.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74625776,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-64810/74625776.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/revealed-filmmakers-queue-up-to-register-corona-in-their-movie-titles/articleshow/74625776.cms

35,['15/03/2020'],Look beyond ‘greatest hits’. India has Van Goghs waiting to be discovered,"While others buy paintings to fill empty walls,

and

Kito De Boer

do it backward – designing homes for the artworks they love. Their art journey started when Kito moved to Delhi as head of

in the 1990s, and today they’ve built up one of the substantial collections of Indian art. With the couple deciding to part with some of their treasures — including an intense self-portrait of

and

’s stunning shot of the Taj — through a Christie’s auction next week, Kito spoke to

Neelam Raaj

about their collecting mantra — “one work at a time- with love”

You started your collection with a Ganesh Pyne in 1993, and bought a lot of work from the Bengal school and the moderns when the market for them wasn’t so hot. How did you go about finding the artists you liked?

How does one go around collecting art as a couple? Did Jane and you never disagree on a particular work?

What’s behind the decision to sell? Is it like a

style declutter?

Which is the work Jane and you will never part with?

In an interview you said that at that time you were probably the only senior partner at McKinsey who did not own any property, and all your savings went into art. Would you still choose art over real estate?

What’s the advice you would give a first time collector?

When Jane and I moved with the family to Delhi in 1993, we knew nothing. We did not know Gaitonde from Ganesh Pyne. We had never heard of (M F) Husain or (F N) Souza. In 1993, there was also no internet or Google. To see works and find out information about artists and their work was a major challenge. It was Jane who became the primary explorer. She would write (telephones were not universally available and email did not exist) to galleries and arrange visits. We were fortunate that every single person welcomed us, and shared their enthusiasm and knowledge.Did Jane and I always agree? No, not initially. Jane has a far better aesthetic sense than I do. I was too much in my head and did not know how to develop and trust my ‘gut’. This led me down blind alleys. I learned from Jane. It is important to stress the central role that she has played. The collection is called the Jane and Kito de Boer collection — her name is first — for a very good reason.There is a simple fact. Art has the potential to transform a house into a home but it will only bring joy if both of you (and also the family) love it. We sometimes had differences about what we bought, but never about what we hung.It is not so much ‘decluttering’ as ‘simplifying’. In general, we have too much stuff. Early in life you tend to accumulate, and then you start to strip down to the essentials. We also realised that we have a large market share of certain artists and that the time has come to release some so that others can see and enjoy what we did. The only rule we gave Christie’s was ‘nothing from the walls’. We have over 1,000 works with many in storage. We have collected about one work a week on average over the past 25 years. This has not stopped, and I’m sure that we will continue because art is central to our lives.This is a bit like asking us who our favorite child is. I would say the most significant work for us is (Rameshwar) Broota’s triptych (Traces of Man). We said to Broota when we bought the work that it would be the most expensive work in our collection. This is exactly what happened. It is so large that we had to select and design our home around it. Jane is an interior designer. She shaped the walls, lighting and paint (a key variable) to make this work ‘sing’.We now have two homes in Dubai and London. Both are anchored around large Broota works.In terms of investment, home and art go hand in hand. Art may turn out to be the better investment but you don’t know until you sell. But neither art nor home is bought because of investment reasons. Buy well, buy the best you can, buy what you love and that is the main reward.Our advice is simple: Look, Listen, Learn. India has many fine young artists beyond the ‘Greatest Hits’. It is an exciting time to collect. In 20 years’ time, new collectors will say that today’s collectors were ‘smart’ to buy when things were so cheap. It took a century for artists like Van Gogh and Schiele to be ‘discovered’ in Europe. There are many Van Goghs out there waiting to be discovered.

36,['15/03/2020'],"Petrol Price: After crude price fall, govt ups duty by Rs 3/litre","NEW DELHI: The government on Saturday jacked up fuel taxes by Rs 3 per litre to soak up much of the gains from a 30% drop in global oil prices and blotting hopes of petrol and diesel prices falling rapidly over the next few days as the impact of Monday’s price crash begins to hit home.

But still, pump prices declined marginally, with petrol dropping below Rs 70 per litre-mark in Delhi for the first time since January 14, 2019, as softer crude offset the impact of higher levies. In spite of the elevated levies, petrol became cheaper by 13 paise a litre and diesel by 16 paise as state-run fuel retailers passed on the amount of gain from lower oil and product prices after adjusting the revised levies.

Oil market projections indicate that even after increase in tax, pump prices are likely to hover around current levels and move within a band, unless oil swings either ways or the rupee weakens further against the Greenback.

This is reminiscent of the Narendra Modi government’s first term when excise duty was cumulatively raised by Rs 11.77 per litre on petrol and on diesel by Rs 13.47 a litre between November 2014 and January 2016 to shore up its kitty by mopping up the much of the gains from oil prices sliding from $110/barrel in March 2014 to $40/barrel in June 2016. The tax was later cut by Rs 2 in October 2017 — months before the May 22, 2018 Karnataka polls — and by Rs 1.5 a year later. But excise duty was again raised by Rs 2 per litre in July 2019.

On Saturday, the government raised special excise duty by Rs 2 per litre to Rs 8 per litre on petrol and Rs 4 a litre, or double, on diesel. In addition, road cess was raised by Re 1 per litre each on petrol and diesel to Rs 10. After the latest revision, consumers will pay Rs 22.98 as excise duty on a litre of petrol, or 32% of Saturday’s retail price at Delhi. On diesel, they will pay Rs 18.83 a litre as excise duty, which is 30% of the price in Delhi. Central taxes on petrol stood at Rs 9.48 per litre on petrol and Rs 3.56 on diesel when the Modi government took over in May 2014.

Officials reckon the higher fuel tax will yield approximately Rs 2,000 crore in the fortnight till March 31, when the current financial year (2019-20) ends. In 2020-21, they expect to garner an additional Rs 39,000 crore revenue. The additional resources will allow the government to continue with infrastructure and social spendings.

Since Monday’s oil price crash, TOI has been consistently reporting that the government will use the window to mop up resources, using the precedence of raising excise duty nine times between November 2014 and January 2016. During a Lok Sabha debate on January 4, 2018, the then leader of the Congress in the House, Mallikarjun Kharge , had estimated the government garnered Rs 5.5 lakh crore by raising excise duty on motor fuel between 2014 and 2016.

Oil prices have been coming down since January but plunged 30% on Monday to $31/ barrel as Saudi Arabia announced hefty discounts and intention to pump up volumes in retaliation against Russia, which walked out of their three-year alliance over OPEC proposal to prop up prices by deepening production cut to 3.6% of global supply. Since January 11, petrol has become cheaper by more than Rs 6 per litre.

NEW DELHI: With reports of confirmed coronavirus positive cases from states now touching 100 including two deaths (health ministry figures put the number of cases at 84), government on Saturday decided to treat the incidence of Covid-19 as a ‘notified disaster’ for the purpose of providing assistance for medical facilities under the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).It also suspended all types of passenger movements on Indo-Pak border from March 16. On Friday, the government had announced that passenger traffic will be allowed only through 19 land check posts of total 37. Passenger bus and rail services to Bangladesh have also been suspended for a month till April 15.The central assistance to states will include setting up of quarantine facilities with temporary provisions for accommodation, food, clothing and medical care, sample collection and screening. It will also cover costs of additional government testing labs, consumables for testing and procurement of essential equipments like protection of healthcare, police, fire and municipal personnel.The initial announcement had mentioned assistance to cover hospitalisation expenses for a patient tested positive. The ministry of home affairs altered the order to remove Rs 4 lakh ex gratia for families of deceased as well as assistance towards hospitalisation expenses. The initial order included compensation for those involved in relief operations. The final order does not mention compensation, which means no sum will be provided from central funds for this purpose.The MHA has “notified” the coronavirus incidence as a disaster. Natural disasters like floods are also similarly notified, but this is the first time for a pandemic, and officials could not recall when the provision was last invoked at a national level for all states.The funds released by the Centre will provide for cost of thermal scanners, ventilators, air purifiers and consumables for government hospitals. SDRF is the primary fund available with states to deal with notified disasters like floods and earthquakes. A state government may use up to 10% of funds available under SDRF for providing immediate relief to victims of an event considered to be a ‘disaster’ within local context in the state.With Covid-19 notified as ‘disaster’, states and UTs can now draw funds from SDRF, in addition to the money made available by state governments and the National Health Mission. The ministry of home affairs (MHA) has issued detailed guidelines to states and UTs in this regard.Of the total 84 positive cases in India so far, 10 have been cured while two with co-morbidities have died. The cabinet secretary on Saturday again reviewed preparedness with chief secretaries of various states. He emphasised on strengthening preventive and control measures with adequate number of isolation wards, enhanced quarantine facilities and to ensure arrivals from identified countries are quarantined as per guidelines and took up steps taken for mass awareness about Covid- 19.According to the health ministry, over 12.29 lakh passengers have been screened from 11,406 flights at the 30 designated airports so far. Apart from the positive cases, government has also identified over 4,000 people who came in contact with the 84 positive cases. “We have kept these 4,000 plus under rigorous observation and efforts are on to identify further contacts of these cases,” an official said.The government has already issued stringent travel restrictions with almost all visas and also restricted passenger movements through land check posts. It has also implemented universal screening of passengers at airports and seaports, self-quarantine measures to effectively prevent, contain and manage Covid-19.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74633026,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1272058,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/corona-outbreak-now-a-notified-disaster/articleshow/74633025.cms

Dr Anil Sinha, one of the doctors at the OPD, said N95 masks and alcohol-based sanitizers were not provided to doctors. “There is no restroom for doctors and other health staff as well at the hospital,” Dr Sinha added.

Dr Suresh Prasad Singh said it is extremely unsafe for doctors to work without masks. “Any suspected patient can come to OPD and the attending doctor might come in contact with the patient,” he said.

East Champaran civil surgeon Dr Rizwan Ahmad reached the hospital in the afternoon and persuaded the protesting doctors to resume duty after wearing general masks.

Dr Ahmad said around 3,000 surgical masks were made available in the district by the health department, but there was shortage of N95 masks. “N95 masks will be made available at all government hospitals in the district soon. These masks will be used by doctors whenever necessary,” he said.

There is also an acute shortage of general masks and alcohol-based sanitizers in East Champaran district, which is located along the India-Nepal border. General mask is being sold at Rs 50 per piece. According to sources, since there is an acute shortage of masks in Nepal as well, they are being smuggled to the neighbouring country from north Bihar.

40,['15/03/2020'],Gandharvgad: An ancient fort that offers adventure &amp; breathtaking views on all sides,"Gandharvgad, an ancient fort in Kolhapur district, which has its name recorded in the list of 111 forts built by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in the 16th century, remains unexplored. This hillock fort is located 916 metre above the sea level and offers a breathtaking view on all sides. A weekend outing to Gandharvgad offers an adventurous trek amidst nature and heritage.

How to reach

Gandharvgad is located in the Chandgad tehsil of Kolhapur district, about 107 km from city. The fort can be reached within two hours from the city. Travelling on Kolhapur-Belagavi route, one has to take a right deviation after the Tavandi ghat and then head towards Gandharvgad passing through Gadhinglaj, Nesari, Adkur, Satawne and Walkuli village. Walkuli is located at the base of the fort from where one has to trek for around 50 minutes to reach the top of the fort. It is advisable that one must carry food and water during the journey.

Legend has it

Sagar Yadav, a city resident, said, “There is a mention of this fort in Sabhasad Bakhar, a book on the history of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. In January 1666, he captured this fort in the conquest of Panhala with an army of over 5,000 troops. Again, in July 1687, the Desai’s of Kakti and Desai’s of Hukkeri captured this fort from the Marathas, for which, Bijapur ruler Adilshah had promised Deshmukhi of Ajamnagar and Ajra-Chandgad respectively. Adilshah controlled this fort for many years. Even during the reign of Peshwas, Sadashivrao Bhau Peshwa stayed in this fort for some time during his Karnataka campaign. This fort was destroyed by the British in 1844.” Today, the condition of Gandharvgad is much in ruins. The fort premises comprises a well, Lord Hanuman and Chaloba temple, some plinths and few residences.

Flora and fauna

This fort offers lush green surroundings. Umakant Chavan, a nature researcher, said, “Gandharvgad is one of the best places in Chandgad taluka and is full of natural beauty. It is also famous as an ecological hotspot among nature researchers. One can spot wild boars, antelope and bison here.”

42,['15/03/2020'],Civic body orders service providers to remove dangling wires,"TOI had first reported about the menace of dangling wires

Surat: Finally , residents may get protection from dangling cables and wires on flyovers and street light poles across the city.

Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has cracked the whip on cable and internet service providers by issuing a notice to them. They have been asked to remove the wires within 15 days or else be prepared for legal action under Bombay Provisional Municipal Corporations (BMPC) Act on Friday.

The action follows a report published in TOI dated February 15, highlighting the issue of cables and wires hanging loosely on trees, flyovers and hoardings posing a threat to the lives of the residents.

Rajesh Modi, a social activist, had written to the civic body demanding action against the service providers for risking the lives of pedestrians and commuters with loose wires and cables.

A 56-year-old man was mowed down by a luxury bus in Adajan when he fell down from his two-wheeler after he got entangled in an overhead cable wire hanging loosely from a tree in May 2019.

The SMC’s public notice states that there are about 117 flyovers, railway overbridges, river bridges and bridges across the city. The internet and DHT cable operators have run their wires on the bridge structures covering the street light poles. The cables and wires hang very low, increasing chances of accidents.

Rajesh Pandya, executive engineer of SMC’s bridge cell, told TOI, “Bridges, trees and electricity poles are the best spots where internet and cable service providers hang their wires, without considering safety of commuters and pedestrians on road. We have given 15 days to them to remove all the wires and cables or else they should be prepared to face legal action under BPMC Act. Even Gujarat high court had issued an order asking that these cables and wires be removed as they pose threat to the people on road.”

43,['15/03/2020'],Bihar police to book traffickers under tougher laws,"Representative image

PATNA: The state police headquarters has directed all SPs to book those arrested in human trafficking cases under the stringent Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2015 and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences ( POCSO ) Act 2012 apart from the Immoral Trafficking (Prevention) Act (ITPA) 1956.

IG (weaker sections), Ratan Sanjay Katiyar , who functions under the CID wrote to the SPs early this week seeking that those arrested during raids in red light areas to rescue girls be booked under relevant sections of JJ Act 2015 and POCSO Act 2012 to prevent them from getting bail easily.

The IG’s letter stated that there have been instances where the accused got bail due to lack of evidence to substantiate the charges levelled against them. “If the accused are booked under the above mentioned Act, it will be difficult for them to obtain bail,” the letter added.

According to the NCRB report of 2017, Bihar ranked third after Rajasthan and West Bengal in terms of incidents of human trafficking. The report revealed that 362 boys and 33 girls below the age of 18 years were rescued from the clutches of traffickers in the state. Out of 395 children, 366 were put into forced labour.

The NCRB report released in October last year said Bihar Police registered 121 FIRs in 2017 against human traffickers, but couldn’t file a single chargesheet resulting in zero conviction in human trafficking cases in the state. “The letter issued by IG, weaker sections, will work as deterrent to human traffickers,” an SP posted in north Bihar said.

ADG, CID, Vinay Kumar, however, cited poverty and illiteracy as the main reasons behind trafficking of children in the state. Asked about the measures taken by the state government to rehabilitate rescued children, the ADG said, “The labour and social welfare departments have come out with a slew of schemes specifically for such cases.”

In addition, the state has in place a ‘Child Labour Tracking System’, which keeps track of a rescued child till he/she attains the age of 18. “Their rehabilitation is ensured with the help of funds from the state government while the labour department comes out with ‘skill development’ programmes,” he pointed out.

According to Suresh Kumar, executive director of a Patna-based NGO—DIRECT, there are at least 10 to 15 human trafficking gangs active in Bihar. “Trafficking of children will continue till the state government takes stringent action against those involved in the crime,” Kumar said.

PATNA: Patna has bagged 32nd rank among 100 cities in the country which were picked up to assess implementation of the Smart City projects.

The ministry of housing and urban affairs announced periodical rankings of smart cities on Friday, based on the progress and completion rate of the projects . The current rankings are based on work done by departments concerned under the Smart City project from October 1, 2019 to March 1, 2020.

In the last rankings, the city had secured 39th rank. Earlier, the evaluation of smart cities was an annual exercise, but the ministry made it a half-yearly affair last year.

Patna has secured an overall score of 42.89 – project implementation (22.74 points), funds transfer (14 points) and funds utilisation (6.15 points).

Of 100 points, 60 points were on the implementation of the project, 14 on funds transfer, 14 on funds usage and 12 on sending utility certificates.

Urban development and housing minister Suresh Kumar Sharma said he reviewed the project status and utilisation of funds in all four smart cities of Bihar – Patna, Bhagalpur, Biharsharif and Muzaffarpur.

“Patna has witnessed several problems in implementing Smart City projects. There is no expert to guide the officials. Several projects, including Dutch Café on Ashok Rajpath , are being added in Smart City project even though the area is not part of smart city. Patna high court had also stayed some projects. However, despite all the difficulties, we are now back on track and trying to expedite the projects,” the minister said.

“The state has got Rs 984.50 crore under Smart City mission – Rs 380 crore for Patna, Rs 110 crore for Biharsharif, Rs 312.50 crore for Muzaffarpur and Rs 382 crore for Bhagalpur,” Sharma said.

Harshita, public relations officer of Patna Smart City Limited , said the city’s ranking has improved five notches. “This time, the evaluation criteria were different. Under new methodology, we have improved in the ranking,” she said.

Bhagalpur secured 70th rank, Biharsharif on 72nd rank and Muzaffarpur 95th rank.

HUBBALLI: Former Union minister and Congress MLC CM Ibrahim on Saturday said that the central government had responded in the affirmative to his suggestions on tweaking the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ), the National Population Register ( NPR ) and the National Register of Citizens ( NRC ).

Ibrahim said that Union minister of state for the Prime Minister’s Office Jitendra Singh had assured him of introducing the required amendments, which the former said, would go a long way in soothing the jangled nerves of the Muslim population in India. “I had written to the PMO suggesting a few changes to the CAA, and responding to the same, Singh invited us to New Delhi last week. We drew his attention to the Nehru-Shoukat Ali Pact, which contained a stipulation that only minorities ought to be allowed to migrate from Pakistan to India and vice-versa,” said the former Union minister.

On the specifics of the change that he wanted introduced, Ibrahim said, “The Union government made a mistake by listing out the six minority communities in the CAA. If the act were to merely use the term ‘minorities’, the controversy surrounding the legislation will end. No Muslim in Pakistan wishes to come to India. Also, Muslims here will feel secure should the Centre introduce this amendment. One must remember that the CAA can be troublesome not only for Muslims, but also for nearly 73% of the population in India constituted by Dalits, Devadasis and other minority religions.”

Although pleased with union home minister Amit Shah ’s assurance that the government would seek no documents as part of the NPR exercise, Ibrahim said that the former must issue a circular to this effect. “A circular will bind the government to this commitment legally. But such developments indicate that the Union government is willing to relax rules pertaining to controversial acts,” said the senior Congress leader.

Ibrahim said that a delegation of 13 chief ministers, MPs, led by former Union minister Ghulam Nabi Azad would meet PM Narendra Modi to discuss the implementation of CAA and other key issues. The former minister said that he had written to Modi, asking him to convene an emergency meeting with former PM Manmohan Singh , the governor of the Reserve Bank of India and leading Indian economists to discuss the economic crisis that the country is currently in the grips of.

KOLKATA: The KMC assessment department is gearing up to introduce online sanction of mutation of properties. On Saturday, mayor Firhad Hakim said, “We are in the final stages of preparations for introduction of the online mutation facility. We will announce the date of introduction soon.”

According to Hakim, the process of simple mutation cases won’t take much time. Moreover, an applicant will not need to submit hard copies of the necessary documents every time an assessment department official demands. “We needed to bring transparency in the system and cut down on the time to give relief to the property owners for mutation of assets. Under this process, anybody can apply for mutation online. An applicant needs to upload scanned copies of some mandatory documents and our officials will examine them. If there are no major disputes, we will issue a mutation certificate within three working days,” said an assessment department official.

Apart from issuing mutation certificates online, the civic authorities are also keen on giving relief to owners of buildings on a plot — 5 cottah and above — by allowing them to add a floor under an amended provision of the KMC building rules. Under the rules, any person with a building on a plot measuring 5 cottahs and above may add an extra floor under the additional Floor Area Ratio scheme after creating mandatory open space.

However, on Saturday, Hakim got a call from a resident of Harish Mukherjee Road who complained that despite adhering to the building department norms he was not being issued an NOC by the fire services department to construct an additional floor in his G+4 structure. Hakim said that in such cases, the fire services department might need to amend its rules.

PATNA: From shutting down educational institutions to cancelling sports and cultural events, the state government has come up with several measures to prevent spread of coronavirus. Health officials said the department was fully prepared to tackle the threat. TOI on Saturday visited some premier hospitals in the city to check the ground reality.

Patna Medical College and Hospital: PMCH, the state’s largest government hospital, has set up a 20-bed isolation ward for patients with coronavirus symptoms. The hospital has converted its VIP cottage into an isolation ward. PMCH deputy superintendent Dr Rajesh Kumar, who was on visit to the isolation ward, said four people had been kept there. “Samples of two patients were tested negative for coronavirus. We are awaiting reports of the two remaining patients,” he said. The nursing staff at the isolation ward were wearing masks but working without other protective gears. The emergency unit of the hospital was, however, stinking. Sanitizers were nowhere to be seen.

Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences: This hospital lacked sufficient ventilators. Though IGIMS has 40 ventilators, all were occupied on Saturday. A hospital staff said patients are being returned due to lack of ventilator. Two rooms with one bed each had been separated for coronavirus suspects. IGIMS superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said, “We will use the top floor of our rest house with 40 beds as isolation ward and make arrangements for additional ventilators.”

New Gardiner Road Hospital: There was no facility to handle coronavirus suspects at the hospital. Though around 300 patients visit the outpatient department of the hospital per day, it lacks ventilator. The hospital also has no ICU.

Private hospital on Bailey Road: Unlike government health institutes, this private hospital was much cleaner. Posters and banners have been put up in the waiting room, informing people about precautionary measures. Dr Talat Halim, regional director (east) of the group that runs the hospital, has initiated several measures to improve infrastructure at the hospital for the treatment of the coronavirus suspects. Senior infection control nurse of the hospital, Nidhi James, said a dedicated team was working to keep the hospital neat and clean. Deputy nursing superintendent of the hospital, Sandeep Singh, said announcements are made at an interval of every one hour, asking people to wash their hands.

Is the government thinking about invoking Section 2 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 in the state?

Several important decisions were taken at a high level meeting chaired by CM Nitish Kumar on Friday to prevent spread of coronavirus in the state. The government is watchful and deliberations will be held on more measures required to be taken at another important meeting to be held on Monday.

What about screening of people coming to Bihar via India-Nepal border?

We have reviewed measures adopted at check posts at Nepal border. The review meeting was participated by senior officials of districts concerned and those from Sashastra Seema Bal. People are being screened at the integrated check post (ICP) and 49 other check posts at the border. Thermal scanners have also been installed at Raxaul ICP.

What measures are being taken to ensure that people in home quarantine adhere to the medical norms for prevention of the virus?

As there has been no positive case of Covid-19 in Bihar so far, we are not thinking about home isolation right now. Nevertheless, all required steps are being taken to spread awareness about advisory issued by the government for common people related to prevention of coronavirus.

Is shortage of doctors a challenge?

We cannot increase the number of doctors overnight. However, if situation demands, the state government will take help from all sources, including private and Army doctors.

Masks and sanitizers are readily not available in the state

The government has already clarified that face masks are required only for people showing symptoms of Covid-19 or even other influenza and viral diseases. However, the government will ensure availability of sufficient quantity of masks.

Are suspected people being screened at bus stands and railway stations?

Screening of all passengers coming out of trains and buses is not possible. Nevertheless, we are taking all necessary steps to tackle any exigency.

Is the Centre supporting the state in tackling the situation?

The Centre has been fully supportive in providing all kinds of assistance. Interactions are being held regularly with officials in New Delhi through videoconferencing.

66,['15/03/2020'],Third giraffe dies at SoU safari park in six months,"Bharuch/Surat: A 15-month-old giraffe died due to diaphragmatic hernia at the Sardar Patel Zoological Jungle Safari Park near the Statue of Unity on Thursday. This is the third giraffe death, of the four brought from South Africa , in last six months.

Earlier, two impalas and one zebra had died at the safari park near the world’s tallest statue in Kevadia, Narmada district. All animals for the park were brought in October last year and the park had opened for public in February this year.

The safari park is developed in 375 acres of forest land and houses over a thousand animals and birds of different species.

The first giraffe had died in November 2019 due to pre-acute mortality syndrome. Later in Januaary this year, another died due to the same syndrome.

It is believed that the weather does not suit to these animals. However, officials of Jungle Safari park are denying the reason for the environment.

Ram Ratan Nala, director of the safari park at Kevadia told TOI: “It is an unfortunate that we lost another giraffe due to diaphragmatic hernia. As this occurs internally, its symptoms are not visible from outside. It happens due to a traumatic event in which diaphragm, a vital organ of the respiratory system is affected.”

“The giraffe’s condition was normal till Wednesday, when observed some abnormalities. Our team put its best efforts but unfortunately could save it,” he added.

When asked if the giraffe had died as the weather condition did not suit it, Nala said, “The giraffe was here since past six months was well acquainted with the weather. So, I don’t believe that weather was an issue.”

NEW DELHI: Five more people were arrested on Saturday for the murder of Intelligence Bureau officer Ankit Sharma during the riots in northeast Delhi . Police also received the autopsy report that detailed 51 major injuries, including 12 stab wounds on Sharma’s body.

The cops identified the five new suspects as Firoze, Javed, Gulfam and Shoaib from Chand Bagh and Mohammed Anas from Mustafabad. Salman from Sundar Nagarihad already been arrested on Thursday. They had identified the accused from CCTV footage, eyewitness accounts and local informers. The cops have made identikits of two other suspects and identified five more men, who are currently on run.

Delhi Police also received Sharma’s autopsy report, which details 51 major injuries, including 12 incised stab wounds. However, these cannot be taken as the exact number of injuries on the body, an officer explained, because there are instances of multiple contusions (injuries) at some injury points, which means that the man was wounded many times at the same spot on the body. The actual injury count, therefore, could be much higher.

“Point number 26, for example, mentions multiple railway track contusions of variable size and direction on the right thigh on an area of 26x11,” a source cited from the report. “And at point number 28, there are multiple railway track contusions on the right hip in an area of 13x13 cm.” ‘Railway track contusions’ are injuries caused by objects like rods or staffs.

The cause of death was determined to be “shock due to haemorrhage due to injury to lung and brain”. The report added, “Injuries number 18, 19, 34-37 and 42 — which comprise deep stabs and blunt force impacts — were sufficient to cause death.”

As per the post mortem report, injury number 18 was a stab wound, elliptical in shape and 4.5x1 cm in size with a deep cavity. “The wound pierces the skin on the left side of the back. The intercostal space and lower lobe of the left lung (collapsed),” the doctors concluded. Injury number 19 is a similar stab wound elliptical in shape vertically measuring 4x0.8 cm with a deep cavity going forwards, downwards and outwards into the left side of the chest.

As per the report, injury number 34 was an L-shaped contused lacerated wound on the scalp with the vertical axis measuring 1x0.5 cm and the horizontal axis of 1.5x0.5 cm, close to the midline and 4.5 cm above the right ear. Injury number 37 was also a lacerated wound of the size of 5.8x0.5 cm vertically located on right side of the head. Injury number 42 was an incision wound (chop) horizontally on the right side of the forehead.

Sharma’s body had been found in a drain near his home in Chand Bagh on February 27, a day after he went missing. Police is also interrogating suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain in connection with the IB officer’s murder.

“The state government is fully prepared to fight against coronavirus. Each district is equipped with 10-bed isolation ward to handle coronavirus cases. Isolation wards have also been set up in 24 private and government medical college hospitals in the state,” Yogi said.

Urging people not to create panic by spreading rumours or falling prey to it, the CM said, “One should maintain personal hygiene and avoid going to crowded places. Instead of shaking hands, people should adopt and promote our traditional Indian way of greeting by folding hands.”

He said all preventive measures were being taken to check the spread of coronavirus. “Adequate arrangements have been made in the isolation ward of district hospital. A sharp vigil is being maintained on foreign visitors at airports, railway stations and bus stops,” he said.

Meanwhile, two persons from Ghazipur having symptoms similar to novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) were admitted to the isolation ward of Sir Sunderlal Hospital at Banaras Hindu University on Saturday and their test results are awaited.

Earlier, 13 people, including a woman from the US, were discharged from the isolation ward after their test reports were found to be negative. “BHU hospital is fully prepared to manage coronavirus cases.

70,['15/03/2020'],April date for govt’s mohalla marshal pilot in four seats,"NEW DELHI: Come April , Delhi government is likely to initiate its ambitious ‘ mohalla marshals ’ scheme — a security layer between the police and citizens to help women and senior citizens feel safer — by deploying civil defence volunteers in four assembly constituencies as a pilot project.

A total of 60-80 civil defence volunteers will be deployed in each municipal ward of the four assembly constituencies, which are yet to be shortlisted. On an average, each assembly segment comprises of four municipal wards. The name of four assembly constituencies is likely to be finalised within this week, sources claimed.

Delhi government had earlier conducted a pilot on mohalla marshals in Burari assembly area, which, officials claimed, had proven successful. However, before the scheme is launched pan-Delhi, the state government has decided to do one more pilot in a larger area.

Deployment of mohalla marshals to make the city safer, especially for women, was a part of the promises made by CM Arvind Kejriwal in his 10-point guarantee card ahead of assembly polls earlier this year.

After forming the government in Delhi for the third time, Kejriwal had called a meeting of all stakeholders to start working on the implementation of the guarantee card. Senior government officials confirmed that mohalla marshals were one of the top priorities of the government and could help in controlling cases of the harassment of women and street crime.

The department of women and child development, which had earlier been tasked with the responsibility of launching the project, had prepared a tentative plan and estimated the requirement of about 25,000 civil defence volunteers to man the entire capital in three shifts.

Since the WCD department lacked the expertise to manage the huge project, it was transferred to the revenue department.

PUNE: The Yerawada police on Friday booked a person on the charge of duping a 26-year-old college student of over Rs1.96 lakh on the pretext of selling him a drone and a camera at a cheap price.

Police said the incident occurred between November 4 and 11 last year

The student, who is a pursing a bachelors course in animation, had come across an advertisement of a drone being sold at a cheap rate on an e-commerce website on November 4.

“The student then contacted the fraudster and struck a deal for purchasing the drone for Rs15,000,” an officer from Yerawada police said.

“The fraudster then told the student that he is willing to sell a camera for additional Rs15,000, following which the student transferred Rs28,500 for both the products to the fraudster,” the officer said.

The officer said the fraudster later told the complainant that the products would have to be shipped from Dubai. “The student ended up paying him additional Rs1,96,580 for varying charges like import tax, and delivery charges, among others,” the officer said, adding that the student realised he was duped when he failed to receive the products a few days later.

“He filed a complaint with the cybercrime police which was later transferred to us,” the officer added.

The 34-year-old businessman approached the crime branch of the Pimpri Chinchwad police after the suspects called him and sent him text messages issuing threats of dire consequences.

According to police, some businessmen from Pimpri and Mumbai came together a few months ago and decided to have a group to discuss their business activities.

According to the complaint, some members were aware about the complainant’s reluctance to join the group and started passing comments. The police said the complainant requested them to stop passing such comments and threatened to quit the group.

The suspects then threatened him, saying they would circulate these images and videos on different social networking sites to defame him. The complaint stated that the suspects demanded Rs 50 lakh from the complainant as extortion.

77,['15/03/2020'],Goa unprepared to tackle virus outbreak: Oppn,"Panaji: Opposition leader Digambar Kamat has accused the BJP-led state government of being unprepared to handle the threat posed by Covid-19 and prevent an outbreak of the disease in Goa.

“The preparedness of the state government was clear from the fact that coughing and sneezing continued during the chief minister Pramod Sawant’s media briefing,” Kamat said. He was reacting to Sawant’s announcement of a slew of measures, including closure of schools and casinos, to prevent a potential outbreak of the virus in the state.

Former revenue minister and independent MLA Rohan Khaunte meanwhile blamed Sawant’s indecisiveness for delay in execution of necessary preventive measures. Both Kamat and Khaunte suggested that the state needs “speedy proactive preventive measures” to ensure that coronavirus does not enter the state.

“These preventive measures should have been implemented earlier. Off-shore casinos are breeding grounds for the virus and should have been closed,” Khaunte said.

The opposition also said the recent measures taken by the administration to curb the spread of the virus appeared contradictory and lacked scientific logic. “On one hand, the government announces closure of schools and on the other hand, allows exams to continue. They’ve decided to ban closed-door meetings and events and shut pubs and clubs, but allow malls to remain open,” said Kamat. He also questioned Sawant’s move of leaving the fate of Shigmo parades in the hands of local organising committees.

On the ban announced on campaign meetings for the upcoming zilla elections, Kamat said, “This is a clear indication of growing support for opposition candidates. Hence, the government is trying to create fear in the minds of the public to restrict large voter turnout.”

79,['15/03/2020'],"Signs of spring in the air, but ‘neglected’ vertical gardens don’t offer cheerful sight","NEW DELHI: While the season of spring is here and many intersections and roundabouts in Delhi are in full bloom, many poorly maintained vertical gardens in the city are still proving to be an eyesore for commuters. At some points, specific plants have withered away while at others, stolen pots have left behind empty frames. Lack of civic sense coupled with lack of maintenance by the agencies is proving to be an obstacle for the vertical greening initiatives.

While every year civic agencies announce plans to set up more vertical gardens costing several crores of rupees, some of the original projects are beginning to show signs of failure. Whatever is left has been damaged by some of the ‘overenthusiastic Delhiites ’ who took a number of these pots home, leaving ugly open gaps in the structure.

The usually grey and drab concrete pillars of the flyover at Africa Avenue T-point had received a complete makeover with sculptures and series of vertical greens. This was also the site of a pilot carried out by the south corporation for testing UV light for sustaining the plants. However, those efforts seem to be wasted as multiple pillars now lie abandoned and some are covered with dry straw of half burnt plants and dry black patches of plastic pots.

Similar scenes can be witnessed at some of the other locations of vertical greens near Lajpat Nagar flyover, Munirka and Nehru Place flyover. The drip irrigation system was found to be non-functional. A maintenance official present on RK Puram site said that drip irrigation was not found to be useful so the department shifted to normal watering using water tankers.

While the coco-peat-based mediums and trays are supposed to be changed regularly, many such replacements were also seen to be lying uncared for. At Nehru Place, several pots had missing plants that the guard claimed had been picked up by pedestrians in the night. A senior south corporation official said that several of the beautified spaces have been handed over to private agencies for maintenance and the complaints will be looked into.

Varieties of ferns, ficus species, ribbon grass and blade grass are used in such vertical gardens that trap excess dust in the environment, helping control PM2.5 emissions in the surroundings. There is now a consensus that vertical greening is a good idea for the capital facing some of the highest pollution indicators in the world.

One of the biggest contributors to Delhi’s air pollution is road dust. It accounts for 35% of PM2.5 emissions, a study by IIT Kanpur recently revealed. According to a report by the Union environment ministry, over 131 tonnes of dust is generated each day in Delhi.

Besides giving a cool look to the city with street art, such gardens will also reduce “urban heat island effect”, thereby helping in reducing city temperatures. Delhi sees a temperature variation of 5-10 degrees Celsius between the coolest and hottest parts of the city due to UHI. Experts claimed that walls on which vertical gardens are erected show a drop of 1-2 degrees, proving that the measure is an effective way of combating temperature. Seeing numerous benefits, agencies have announced dozens of such initiatives in the last month.

PUNE: Some unidentified persons on Thursday evening beat up a human resource (HR) manager of a private company and damaged his car on Paud Road .

Police suspect that the incident was a fallout of awarding of contract to a vendor.

The HR manager (40), a resident of Bhugaon, lodged a complaint with the police on Thursday night. Police said that the HR manager, who works with an IT company at Urawade village near Pirangut, left his office in his car. The car was on way towards Bhugaon from Pirangut when the suspects started tailing it.

Police said that the stretch between Pirangut and Bhugaon on Paud road remains chock-a-block with traffic in the evening. The HR manager thought that he might get stuck in the traffic jam and decided to take a quick ‘U’ turn to reach his office.

He reached a spot close to his office when the suspects brought his car to a halt and hurled abuses at him.

Police said that as soon as he stepped out, the suspects beat him up and issued threats of dire consequences to him. They then smashed the windows of his car with iron rods and stones.

Police said that prima facie it is suspected that the men might have been sent to beat up the manager by some scrap dealers, who used to collect scrap from the company in the past and their contract might have been cancelled or by the workforce providing firm.

HYDERABAD: Health minister Eatala Rajender on Saturday admitted in the assembly that mosquito menace in bastis and colonies was rampant on either side of Musi river.

Stating that seven persons had died of dengue in the city in this financial year, the minister said anti-larval operations and fogging were being taken up to control mosquito breeding.

The state government has prepared a massive Rs 50,000-crore plan to clean and purify the Musi river. Also, Rs 10,000 crore has been allocated for Hyderabad in 2020-21 budget and a major chunk of this would be utilised for Musi project, Rajender said.

Replying to queries from assembly members during the question hour, the minister said as many as 13,341 people were tested positive for dengue, out of which 5,930 were children.

About 350 basti dawakhanas are being set up in the city and 122 are already functioning in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) area. “As many as 70 dawakhanas are functional in Hyderabad, 28 in Medchal and 24 in Rangareddy,” the minister said.

Earlier, BJP MLA T Raja Singh said mosquitoes that carry dengue virus were breeding in stagnant pools in the city which he blamed it on failure of the civic body to take up anti-larval and fogging operations. “After 6pm, thousands of mosquitoes from the Musi river swarm into the houses located on either side of the Musi stretch. Several government hospitals, including Osmania General Hospital (OGH), are located in the close vicinity of the river and patients suffer because of the mosquito menace,” the BJP MLA pointed out.

The minister appealed to the people to ensure that water stagnation is not allowed in abandoned utensils and coolers in houses so that mosquitoes do not breed.

The festival is celebrated annually on the first day of the Hindu month Chaitra. While Phool means flower, Dei is a ceremonial pudding which is offered to everyone on the day.

According to the tradition of the festival, children, especially young girls, collect flowers from nearby areas or forests and go door-to-door to shower them on doorsteps wishing prosperity to the households. In return, the kids are given presents, including sweets and cash.

“Phool Dei is a joyous occasion and celebrations continue for an entire month. However, the first day is the most significant,” said Rakesh Dhirwan, a resident of Ukhimath town of Rudraprayag district.

While showering flowers at doorsteps, kids sing songs like ‘Phool Dei, Chamma Dei Deno Dwar, Bhur Bhakar Vo Dei Sei Namashkar, Puje Dwar.’

“Besides flowers, children also keep green leaves, jaggery, coconut, and rice grains in their baskets that are made from Ringal (hill bamboo),” said Madan Bhatt, a resident of Buruwa village of Rudraprayag district.

On Saturday, despite overcast conditions and rain, the festival was celebrated at many places in Uttarakhand. In Srinagar in Pauri Garhwal, people assembled at the Nageshwar temple in the town before 6 am. Thereafter, a Shobha Yatra ( procession ) was carried out across the town amid singing and dancing.

Speaking about the relevance of the festival, DR Purohit, former professor of HNB Garhwal University in Srinagar, said, “ This is the only festival which is associated with children and has been celebrated for a long time in Uttarakhand. It is a unique festival which should be given national as well as global recognition.”

In a similar vein, Kamal Badoni, a resident of Bhatwara village of Tehri district who now lives in Dehradun , added, “Many of those who have migrated to cities from villages have forgot their culture. They have become too busy for the festival. This is in contrast to our childhood days, when we used to wait for the festival with much anticipation and enjoyed it for over a month.”

KOLKATA: The government decision to put an embargo on large gatherings in its fight against novel coronavirus has prompted Indian Institute of Management Calcutta to consider online interviews of shortlisted candidates for admission to the 2020-22 academic session instead of personal interviews. Of the 2,000 candidates shortlisted for the 480 MBA seats at IIM Calcutta, around 700, who have chosen west and north India regions for the session, remain to be interviewed.

IIMC authorities are likely to take a call next week. Usually, professors from IIM Calcutta travel to different centres across the country to conduct these sessions.

“The institute has finished personal interview of some candidates. But a large number of students are yet to meet the institute’s faculty members for final selection. This is likely to be called off,” said a source. “A proposal to hold the interviews online has been sent for the director’s approval. Instead of appearing for personal interviews in Mumbai and Delhi, the candidates there are likely to be provided with separate time slots at a designated place or centre, where they will have to report for online interviews with the faculty members in Kolkata.” The proposal suggests the candidates be divided into smaller groups and allotted different time slots in order to avoid large gathering at the centres. “The suggestions have been made, keeping in mind the government’s order to limit physical contact or proximity as much as possible” said an official.

However, one of the applicants, who have received interview calls from three IIMs, is apparently not quite happy with the online proposal. “It can lead to misunderstanding when the interviewer can’t see the interviewee in person. Physical presence helps several candidates make a positive impression. Interviews over the virtual world are impersonal,” he said. Even a teacher felt candidates might face difficulties “in absence of visual cues from the interviewer”. “It can be disadvantageous to a certain extent,” she said.

A senior IIM Calcutta official, however, pointed out that such an unprecedented situation called for alternative methods to navigate the current crisis. “If interviews are not conducted at the earliest, the academic session might be delayed, which is not conducive for a two-year programme,” he said.

92,['15/03/2020'],"Development, Simhachalam trust key poll issues in VZM","Visakhapatnam: As the state gears up for the local body elections, the issues that are expected to be critical in Vizianagaram district include lack of development, the proposal to include 178 villages from 12 mandals (most of which are in Parvathipuram division) in the Agency tract and the controversy surrounding MANSAS and the Simhachalam trust.

The proposal for the inclusion of 178 villages, chiefly from Parvathipuram division, which affects close to one lakh individuals could have an impact on the results of at least 10 mandals—such as Kurupam, Pachipenta, Salur, Ramabhadrapuram, Komarada, Jiyyammalavalasa, Makkuva and Komarada.

The issue led to opposition from BC communities, who comprise the chief farming communities in this revenue division, with the community petitioning its leaders from tribal communities to not include the villages in the Agency tract. Though the proposal has not been pushed through, it has also not been discarded, with no clarification from its main proponent, Salur MLA Rajanna Dora.

YSRC’s BC leadership in the division is confident that the proposal will not go through. Senior BC leader and member of National BC Cell, R Madhava said, “The proposal will not be pushed through.”

The TDP leadership is looking to capitalise on this issue and bring the BC community on its side. A senior TDP leader from Parvathipuram division said on condition of anonymity, “The YSRC leadership in Parvathipuram division cannot side-step this issue.”

The other issue is the recent revamp of both MANSAS and Simhachalam Trust managements. Former Union minister P Ashok Gajapathi Raju said, “ This is not a political issue, but a legal one, and I do not wish to make it political.” In the past week, there have been protest meets in Nellimarla, Vizianagaram and Bobbili over the issue and some within the TDP believe that it is likely to have an impact on the local body elections.

Speaking on the controversy, senior YSRC leader Botcha Satyanarayana said at a press meet on Saturday, “Let them go to the court if they believe that the changes are unjust.”

93,['15/03/2020'],Govt mulls using NIC server for taxi meters,"Panaji: The installation of digital meters for taxis in Goa has developed teething problems which is proving to be a hurdle in its implementation. To activate the vehicle location and tracking device (VLTD) and the panic button that are installed along with the digital meters require an internet connection.

While the state transport department was in talks with BSNL for the same, the central government is likely to get the connectivity through the National Informatics Centre (NIC). This may further delay the process of the devices’ implementation in Goa.

“The discussions were over with BSNL, we were at the final stage of signing a contract with them. But right now, we’re exploring this opportunity with NIC, and we will present a file to the government. Then, the government will decide which one to go ahead with,” a transport official told TOI.

He further informed that while BSNL internet services would be chargeable for the taxi operator, with the NIC, the government will have to manage the costs on a 40-60 sharing basis. If the NIC gets a go-ahead, the infrastructure will be availed of on a sharing basis – 60% investment by the Centre and 40% by the state government.

“There are a lot of agencies involved in this; it’s not just fitting of digital meters alone. We have sub-devices for monitoring, vehicle tracking, panic button, etc. Even though BSNL belongs to the Indian government, we will have to pay for their internet service. However, with the government contemplating giving it out to NIC, the service will be free. The central government will decide which facility is best and in the interest of the public,” the official said.

“Now, we are already in negotiation with BSNL. We’ve already entered an agreement with them which has to be signed by the government. The file is pending with the government currently. With NIC coming in, we may have to change this.” he added.

“General practitioners who are running standalone clinics in the city and those practising at private hospitals should compulsorily ask patients with flu-like symptoms whether they have come back from abroad in the last 28 days or a month,” public health expert Ramchandra Hankare said at a meeting held with Indian Medical Association (IMA) members and hospital representatives.

Hankare said, “If doctors come across any patient who fits into this category (flu-like symptoms and international travel), they can refer them to Naidu hospital or isolation care at 11 private hospitals that have been approved to isolate and treat patients.”

A total of 11 private hospitals in the city have created isolation wards and kept 41 beds ready only for such patients.

“If such a patient denies to get admitted, they (doctors) should notify him/her to us immediately,” Hankare said.

Videos circulating on social media and creating undue panic by spreading wrong information about Covid-19 are being collacted by IMA members, Pune branch. “We have already collated and compiled quite a few videos circulating on social media. We have requested authorities to take action by stopping their circulation and also initiate stringent punishment against those who are creating and circulating them, including doctors,” eye surgeon Sanjay Patil, president of IMA, Pune branch, said.

IMA has started a 24x7 helpline (9999672238/9999672239) to give information on Covid-19 infection.

Pune: Confusion reigned supreme on the first day of shutdown for schools and colleges in the city. Some institutes proceeded with their schedule, while others suspended activity after the first lecture.

The collector called a meeting of educational institutes on Saturday morning for clarity. “Previously, our college management had said they would not be shutting down and we had decided to protest today. The morning batch had their classes. But when we went to college, they announced that all classes would be suspended till further notice,” Satyam Surana, an ILS Law College student, said.

Students also turned up at other colleges in the city. “We saw the CM’s announcement and also read it in the news. But there were no message from the college. Around noon, the institute announced it was being closed,” a student from Fergusson College said.

Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) also announced classes would be suspended till March 29. Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics director Somak Raychaudhury said Iucaa had not shut because it had only PhD students.

Deputy directorate of education Anuradha Oak clarified the education department’s previous circular, stating that action would be taken against students or teachers roaming around, was not to be taken literally, as it only meant that they must not move in groups.

Commissioner of education Vishal Solanki said, “Further orders regarding reopening of the institutes will be given later after taking stock of the situation.”

NEW DELHI: With untimely rain and hailstorm damaging the Rabi crops , the farmers of the national capital have planned to meet lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Monday to demand compensation for their loss.

The hailstorm, claimed farmers, not only damaged the mustard and whole gram crops, but also flattened the wheat crop and destroyed the fruits and the vegetables.

Delhi minister Kailash Gahlot, meanwhile, said that AAP government was assessing the situation. “We are taking feedback from farmers of different villages on the nature and extent of loss. After assessing the situation, the government will take a call,” Gahlot said.

Delhi government had announced a compensation of Rs 20,000 per acre when rain and hail had extensively damaged the crops in 2015. There are about 197 villages in northwest, west, south and northeast parts of the city where farming is done. According to Economic Survey of Delhi 2018-19, Delhi in 2017-18 had 34,750 hectares of cropped area. More than 80% of farmers have small land holdings of just 1-2 acre. Delhi has a total area of 1,47,488 hectares.

Delhi Dehat Kisan Bachao Manch president Naresh Kumar said the small farmers are in distress and need immediate help. “The first spell of rain on March 7 majorly destroyed the crops. Whatever little was left was destroyed in the hailstorm on Saturday,” Kumar claimed.

“We are going to meet the officials at LG office tomorrow to discuss the total loss and a possible scheme to provide compensation to the poor farmers. We had even requested the chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for a hearing, but are yet to hear from his office,” he added.

Pramod Kumar Singh, a farmer in Kanjhawla area of northwest Delhi, who, along with his three brothers, own and till about 10 hectares of land, said almost 90% of his wheat crop has been damaged in the rain. “My entire investment is gone. Only some parts of covered agricultural land where we had sown some vegetables are left. But that is not enough for our joint family of 15 people to sustain,” Singh said.

Naresh Kumar said that a farmer makes an investment of about Rs 40,000 per acre to grow the crop every season.

Meanwhile, Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Goel visited some parts of Narela to assess the situation. He demanded that the farmers be given a compensation of Rs 60,000 per acre by Delhi government.

SSP Shivasimpi Channappa said all the policemen have been transferred to reserve police lines and further departmental action would be taken after the investigation is complete.

The complaint was registered on Friday by one Ankur Tiwari, a resident of Reti area. He had recently joined a liquor distribution company as a manager.

In his complaint, Tiwari alleged the crime branch members and its in-charge, Krantiveer, threatened to book him in a fake case of selling illicit liquor and forcefully took his bag containing Rs 54, 200 cash on gunpoint.

He further claimed that the policemen also took his mobile phone and gave him a day to pay more money.

Inspector Ashok Pal, who is investigating the case, said, “We have registered an FIR against Krantiveer, who is the in-charge of crime branch team, and four other members under IPC sections 392 (robbery), 384 (extortion), 382 (theft after made preparations for causing death) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt). We are trying to contact the complainant for recording his statement, but he is not responding to our calls.”

However, one of the officials booked in the FIR, on the condition of anonymity, has alleged that they are being targeted because of political pressure.

“We were quite close to nabbing a high-profile gang involved in the illegal bottling and sale of liquor in the district, but the accused was saved by an influential politician. We had caught the accused red-handed, but we had to release him due to political pressure. Several such people are selling illicit liquor with fake labels and one can simply scan the barcode to find out the truth,” he said.

Earlier on Wednesday, several tanks of illicit liquor and wrappers were seized by the police in Shahjahanpur district. The aggrieved police officer claimed that are being targetted for acting against illegal liquor mafia.

The SSP, however, denied being under any political pressure.

“The complaint was not registered under any political pressure. We are investigating the case and we will ensure that truth comes out,” Channappa said.

PANAJI: The Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC) had sought permission from the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) to develop a ‘streetscape’ project at Dona Paula , but the corporation has been told that the no cement or tar should be used for the beautification work. GCZMA has further said only interlocking pavers should be used in making of the streetscape.

GTDC’s project cell executive engineer had sought permissions from GCZMA for the streetscape project as it is being developed as part of the coastal circuit. Accordingly, GCZMA inspected the area.

“The authority perused the site inspection report by the expert member and after detailed deliberation and discussion, the authority decided to approve the development of streetscape at Dona Paula on the condition that no excavation of mud or other natural structure along the streetscape is allowed. No construction on the seaward side or on the sandy beach is permitted. The streetscape is constructed only by using interlocking pavers and no cement or tar is to be used,” the GCZMA said, in its meeting held last month.

The authority has also said that though GTDC’s assistant engineer had said that consent has been obtained from locals residing along the streetscape, proper traffic management must be devised for the area. GCZMA also said that no hardship or inconvenience should be caused to locals due to the proposed streetscape.

GTDC’s assistant engineer told GCZMA that the location where the streetscape is proposed in not a sandy area, but a lateritic rocky one and the proposed plan also includes providing a few sit-outs along the pavement for senior citizens.

“The proposed circuit as per the plan attached runs through human habitats. The assistant engineer who accompanied the GCZMA expert member for the inspection informed that the department has taken all the NOCs from residents and there is no objection from them for the proposed streetscape,” a member of GCZMA’s expert committee told the authority.

GTDC has also sought permission from GCZMA for beautification and upgradation work at GTDC’s Anjuna beach property under the Centre’s Swadesh Darshan guidelines. This project too was approved by GCZMA after securing a rapid environment impact assessment report from GTDC.

After distributing a compensation of Rs four lakh to family members of three farmers, who were killed during the recent hailstorm, at a gathering in Karanjakala block of Jaunpur district on Saturday, the CM said that he had personally viewed the losses caused to farms and orchards by the hailstorm in the district.

Yogi, who also distributed compensation among 51 farmers for damage to their crops, said that over 10 lakh farmers of the state have been affected by a series of hail and thunderstorms. He said that the compensation against losses caused to the crops before the festival of Holi has been distributed and now assessment of post-Holi losses is in progress.

He said officials in all districts have been directed to engage maximum teams for loss assessment and payment of compensation under the Prime Minister Crop Insurance scheme. Public representatives have also been asked to camp in villages and motivate farmers apart from helping them in getting benefits of the scheme.

Yogi said that those, who have lost their houses, should also not be worried as the district administration officials have been asked to survey their places and ensure reconstruction of their houses under PM or CM housing schemes. He said that his government was working for giving the benefits of schemes available for farmers, to those engaged in contractual farming and also farm labourers.

He asked us to take the body to the Lodhi crematorium,” related Arora.The family again contacted the Delhi health minister’s office, having done so on Friday too. “The deputy health officer of North Delhi Municipal Corporation and doctors from RML reached the cremation ground and we finally carried out the rites at 1pm,” added Arora.Varsha Joshi, commissioner of north corporation, said that in cases like these, electric or CNG crematoria were advised for their contained and high-temperature incineration. “We advised the family to go to the electric facility at Lodhi crematorium, but they preferred Nigambodh Ghat, so the CNG unit was the only option,” remarked Joshi.Avdhesh Sharma, supervisor at Nigambodh, said, “We immediately allowed the last rites once the municipal health officials came.” He added that the delay was caused by the effort to ensure the standard operating procedure for disposal of highly infectious diseases was followed properly.Gupta pleaded that it was the first coronavirus death in the city and “we did not know what had to be done”. However, a corporation health official said the Union health ministry had already issued instructions on coronavirus-related deaths. “Cremations can take place anywhere, preferably an electric facility, but protocol needs to be followed. People handling the body must wear protective suits, gloves and polysheet shoes. After the cremation, they have to be sprayed with disinfectants and all personal protection equipment have to be autoclaved,” he elaborated.Dr Sudhir Gupta, professor and head of forensic sciences at AIIMS, assured there was nothing worrisome about the cremation of an infected body by whatever means. However, in case of a burial, the upper portion of the grave had to be plastered over.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74633340,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-181546,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cremation-of-corona-victim-a-challenge-too/articleshow/74632837.cms

106,['15/03/2020'],Hyderabad jeweller booked for cheating finance firm,"Representative Image

Hyderabad: Central Crime Station (CCS) sleuths have registered a case against a city-based jeweller for allegedly cheating a Kolkata-based finance firm by defaulting on loan repayments and violating their memorandum of understanding (MoU).

Though the case was registered a week ago after the finance firm lodged a complaint against owner of MBS Jewellers Sukesh Gupta and his wife, it came to light on Saturday. The case is still under probe. When officers went to serve notice on them, they were unavailable, CCS officials told TOI.

In 2018, Sukesh Gupta had taken Rs 110 crore loan from the Kolkata firm and entered into an MoU by pledging eight acres of land in Hafeezpet.

Officials said the jeweller took the loan in the name of his real estate firm. As the accused defaulted on instalments, the finance company had auctioned his Hafeezpet property and realised Rs 102 crores. Since the accused did not pledge another property, the finance company could not recover the remaining amount.

“The firm claimed Sukesh still owes Rs 58 crore,’’ police said. In the past, a cheque bounce case was registered against the jeweller.

107,['15/03/2020'],Kochi: 3 excise officers suspended over bribery allegations,"Picture for representational purpose only.

KOCHI: Three excise officers based at two excise stations under Ernakulam excise division have been placed under suspension pending investigation in connection with a bribery allegation by bar owners in Perumbavoor against them. The suspended officers were identified as Kunnathunad excise circle inspector Saji Kumar, Perumbavoor range inspector Sabu R Chandra and preventive officer Prathapan.

According to top excise sources, the three officers were facing a probe by a special investigation team (SIT) constituted by the excise commissioner after a complaint lodged by V Sunil Kumar, president of Federation of Kerala Hotels Association. They were suspended by excise commissioner S Aananthakrishnan through an order sent to Ernakulam deputy excise commissioner A S Ranjith. Sources said that the officers will have to face a vigilance inquiry too in connection with the case.

As per the complaint, the officers accepted lump sums each month as bribe from nearly 16 bar owners in Kunnathunadu excise circle over the past one year.

The incident came to light when bar owners, who have fed up with the demands made by the officers, raised the issue at one of their state conference held in August 2019. Subsequently, the Federation of Kerala Hotels Association had intervened in the issue and filed complaints before chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and excise minister T P Ramakrishnan. After this, an inquiry had been ordered by the excise commissioner in addition to a VACB probe.

The VACB team had recorded the statements of several excise officers in Kunnathunad circle and nearly 20 officers had been transferred to other stations as disciplinary action. But the three officers, who were suspended now, did not face any action then. As the controversy swirled up, the officers returned the bribe money back to the bar owners through a mediation talk, which was reportedly arranged by the excise officers association.

But the official inquiry has found evidences against the officers and a report was submitted to the commissioner. The officers were suspended based on this report. “Their suspension order came a week ago. The officers now have to face inquiry,” said Ranjith.

109,['15/03/2020'],"200 protesters, including Cong district president, booked for violating section 144","Pilibhit: Around 200 people, including Congress’ district president Harpreet Singh Chabba, were booked on Friday for violating section 144 of the criminal procedure code (CrPC) after they protested against the district administration, who had banned the cultivation of summer paddy in Pilibhit.

Section 144 prohibits the assembly of four or more persons.

The police action came after Chabba, with an assembly of farmers and party workers, staged a dharna at Nehru Park in Pilibhit city.

According to police, the protesters did not get permission from city magistrate Arun Kumar Singh to protest.

The FIR was lodged by Pilibhit Kotwali police station following a written complaint by the station house officer (SHO), Shrikant Dwivedi, in which he stated that the Congressmen could not show the valid permission for dharna when they were asked.

“It was on the arrival of senior police and administrative officials at Nehru Park, along with the police force, that Chabba presented them with a memorandum of demands, addressing it to the district magistrate and stopped the dharna,” the SHO said.

He said the protesters were also booked under sections 147 (rioting), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code.

The protest was in response to an order of district magistrate Vaibhav Shrivastav which had banned sowing of summer paddy crops across the district.

The order, dated December 29, 2019, reasoned that the paddy is detrimental to the environment as well as the subsoil water, as it requires a large quantity of chemical fertilizers and insecticides.

He further said summer paddy crops requires large amounts of underground water and hence it is unsustainable in Pilibhit, which recives low rainfall from February end till May end—when the summer paddy crops are sown.

“This crop also contributes to air pollution as it is dependent on diesel pumping sets for irrigation,” the order states.

“Also, the summer paddy is spoiling the fertility of soil due to lack of possibility of producing humus in fields. The crisis of drinking water in future could not be denied as an outcome of summer paddy cultivation,” the DM in the order said.

Concurring with the district administration's order, an agricultural scientist of Krishi Vigyan Kendra at Pilibhit, a unit of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Agriculture University, Meerut, Dr SS Dhaka said, “Every 1.60 kilograms of summer paddy needs around 2,000 litres of groundwater due to complete lack of rainwater during the season of this crop. With reported production of 80 to 85 quintals of paddy per hectare in Pilibhit district, the total cultivated area of 35,000 hectares of this crop is liable to discharge over 37,000 crore litres of groundwater every year.”

A former plant physiology scientist of International Rice Research Institute in Philippines, Dr Ravindra Kumar, told TOI, “Of the total groundwater that is used to irrigate summer paddy crop, 40 % to 45 % evaporates, 35% transpires, 5% to 7% is lost in runoff and merely 13% to 2 % of water percolates through soil remains for recharging.”

112,['15/03/2020'],Kerala: Customs seizes gold worth Rs 38L at Cial,"Picture for representational purpose only.

KOCHI: Customs air intelligence unit foiled yet another attempt to smuggle gold and seized the yellow metal worth about Rs 38 lakh at the Cochin International Airport Ltd ( Cial ) on Saturday. The gold was in compound form and it weighed about a kilogram.

Customs made the seizure based on input from the directorate of revenue intelligence (DRI). A peculiar modus operandi was employed by the smugglers for the attempted smuggling. There were two carriers involved in the smuggling bid and they were in a flight from Bahrain, which lands at Calicut before landing at Kochi.

One among the passengers, who hails from Malappuram, boarded the flight from Bahrain. He had a ticket to Kochi even though he could have deboarded at Calicut airport to go to Malappuram. Meanwhile, the second carrier, a Perinthalmanna native, boarded the same flight from Calicut airport.

The Malappuram native had hidden the contraband inside his briefs. The plan was to hand over the contraband to the domestic passenger who would board the flight from Calicut. The photo of the second carrier was already given to the first one and the plan was to make the switch at the lavatory of the flight, 10 minutes after the flight takes off.

As planned, the duo made the exchange. The smugglers had hoped that domestic passengers wouldn’t be checked by customs officers. However, the customs, who intercepted the passengers, recovered the contraband and arrested the duo. Customs are conducting further investigation to find others involved in the smuggling. A Perinthalmanna-based politician is suspected to be involved, said a source.

115,['15/03/2020'],US scientists figure out how Covid-19 enters human cells,"PUNE: Researchers have succeeded in cracking the “spike protein” of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) through which it invades human cells and causes the infection.The researchers, led by Jason McLellan of the University of Texas at Austin, have not just identified the spike protein but also its “receptor” in the human body. Their findings have been published in the international magazine Science.The University of Texas team, which has previously worked on coronaviruses, found through their research that the protein in the novel coronavirus binds “at least 10 times more tightly than the corresponding spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) to their common host cell receptor,” the report published in Science, states.The report further states that, “This is the same human receptor protein targeted by the earlier SARS coronavirus.”The researchers also tested three antibodies known to bind to the SARS coronavirus spike protein to check if they could work with the 2019-nCoV. It did not prove to be successful. “It did not detect binding to the 2019-nCoV spike protein,” the report in Science states.Microbiologists told TOI that the “spike protein” was called so because it sat on top of the spike-like structure of the coronavirus. This protein connects with the molecules in human cells and leads to the infection.“In order to infect or attack the human cell, the virus has to enter it and attach itself to the cell. The receptor is the molecule on the surface of the cell to which the virus attaches. Then it goes inside and takes over the entire functioning of the cell,” said Yogesh Shouche, who heads the National Centre for Microbial Resource at the National Centre for Cell Science.“When you know how the virus is attacking the cell, and these are the proteins which bind to the cells and the molecules on the cell that bind to the protein, it can lead to identifying the way for treatment,” he said.“Either you can find some chemical that inhibits this binding, then that could be the treatment for the virus; or you can develop the antibody, that would be the vaccine,” Shouche added.Microbiologists stressed identifying the “spike protein” was a key step towards developing vaccines and treatment for the virus.

A communiqué, dated March 13 and signed by the FSDA commissioner, has asked food inspectors to visit restaurants and check if the chef, the waiters and other staff are paying attention to personal hygiene such as washing hands with soap and water, and wearing gloves, caps and masks.

Owners of establishments that serve food are required to ensure chairs, tables, kitchen tops, utensils, floors and doors are routinely sanitised and disinfected. Failing to do so despite warnings may lead to cancellation of licence.

The commissioner’s letter states that if any restaurant fails to comply with the instructions, a warning will be issued under Section 55 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. If the warning doesn’t work, action will be taken under Regulation 2.1.8 (4) of the act, which could mean suspension/cancellation of registration/licence.

“We have directed restaurant owners to follow the government advisory. We are keeping tabs on street food vendors to ensure hygiene is not compromised,” said KK Tiwari, officer-in-charge of the Prayagraj unit of FSDA.

Several prominent eateries in the city are already taking steps to contain the Covid-19 infection. They claim to be sanitising both the kitchen and customer lounge as many times as possible.

“We are cleaning tables, chairs, the bar top, stools, door handles etc. with alcohol-based sanitisers. All our customers are also required to use sanitisers once they enter the restaurant,” said Raju Jaiswal, the owner of an eatery at Civil Lines.

123,['15/03/2020'],DNA samples of couple &amp; baby they disowned collected for test,"Bareilly: Nearly nine months after a baby girl suffering from hyperthyroid clitoris was “abandoned” at a city-based private hospital, the health department recently took samples of the baby and her alleged parents for a DNA test. The DNA samples were taken after National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) took cognizance of the matter on the complaint of a local resident. Officials said the DNA report is awaited.

On May 28 last year, the family of the baby disowned her while accusing a private hospital that they exchanged their baby boy with a girl. However, the hospital authorities denied the allegation, saying as the baby is suffering from rare hypertrophied clitoris, due to abnormal enlargement of the clitoris at the time of birth, the family assumed their baby girl is a boy.

After the family “abandoned” the baby at the private hospital here, Child Welfare Committee (CWC) sent the girl to a home for kids in August last year.

DN Sharma, member and magistrate, CWC, said, “Though I had ordered a DNA test in the matter in June last year, it was not conducted due to some unknown reason. After NHRC took cognizance of the matter, the DNA samples for test were collected on March 5 at the district hospital. We are awaiting a report of the DNA test and further action will be taken accordingly. If it turns out in the DNA test, the baby belongs to couple disowning her, action will be taken against them. If in such a case, parents do not want to keep the baby, we will ask them to submit an affidavit so that the child can be given for adoption.”

Chief medical officer Dr Vineet Shukla said, “We collected DNA samples and gave it to police, who sent it to their laboratory for a DNA test. It takes time to prepare a DNA report.”

According to the family, a premature baby boy was born in a private hospital in Rampur’s Milak on May 6 last year in six-and-a-half-month of pregnancy but after the condition of the child deteriorated, they admitted the newborn to a nursery of a private hospital in Bareilly’s Janakpuri after four hours. After the baby was discharged from here, Horilal, a farmer in Raj Dadiya village in Rampur, claimed that baby son was changed with a girl. The family left for their village without taking the baby.

The demand comes after Vhavati villager Santosh Govekar died of an accidental gunshot while on a hunting expedition with a companion in a nearby forest on Tuesday evening.

Vaikunth Gaonkar, a resident of Karapur, had met with a near identical death while on a hunt at Kulan around 15 years ago.

Many wild animals have fallen victim to traps laid by poachers over the past several years, including a leopard at Latambarcem.

The woman, a resident of Raigad Chowk, Cidco, has stated in her complaint with Ambad police that the chain-snatcher had covered his face with a handkerchief. She added that the criminal was wearing a T-shirt, though she cannot not remember its colour.

The matter came to the fore when the woman went to the SSP’s office to lodge a complaint against her neighbour, saying she wanted her daughter back. When questioned, it was revealed that woman had “sold” her daughter two months ago. After coming to know about the fact, the SHO of Katghar police station was directed to detain the woman and register an FIR against her.

Giving details, police said the woman was married nearly three years ago and separated from her husband after she gave birth to a baby girl on January 4. Since she was living alone and her baby daughter had a medical condition, she allegedly threw the newborn on a railway track. But the baby was saved by her neighbor, Rekha. The latter offered to adopt the baby. As part of the deal, an “agreement of adoption” was prepared on a stamp paper and baby’s mother was reportedly given Rs 10,000 for her “consent”.

Two months after giving up her baby, the woman apparently had a change of heart. On Saturday, the woman approached Rekha and asked her to return her daughter but the latter refused. The matter went to the women police station in Moradabad, but to no avail.

Rekha is unmarried and lives in the same locality as the child’s biological mother. She said, “I adopted the girl on January 8. Her medical condition was critical. A proper agreement was made but at that time, I was not aware that a baby cannot be adopted in such a manner.”

Baby’s biological mother said, “I had given my daughter to Rekha because I was not able to take any decision at that time and now, I want my daughter back.”

Additional SP Deepak Bhuker said, “Rekha had adopted the girl when she was on the verge of dying. We have booked the baby’s mother for showing cruelty against her daughter. Decision on adoption will be taken up by child welfare committee.”

Even false allegations pertaining to demand of dowry and ill-treatment come under the ambit of cruelty, the court said.

Judge Sanjiv Jain noted that the wife had made false allegations against the man with respect to impotence, dowry harassment and ill-treatment. “These unsubstantiated allegations are of the nature to cause mental suffering to the petitioner...Such allegations caused profound and lasting disruption in the relationship and also caused deep hurt and reasonable apprehension that it would be dangerous for him to live with the respondent,” the court observed.

The case was filed by the husband through advocate Prabhjit Jauhar, who argued that the wife was “cruel” towards the husband, was impotent and also suffered from hallucinations. Denying the allegations, the wife claimed that her spouse was suffering from erectile dysfunction.

After going through submissions from both sides, the court refused to grant the man divorce on the ground of impotence but allowed divorce to the man on the ground that the false accusation of impotence made by the wife against him was cruelty. It added that the case at hand showed the wife not only making “scandalous and malicious” allegations in the written statement but also in her testimony, which she had “failed” to substantiate. The court , therefore, noted, “Evidence clearly points out to the fact that she has treated the petitioner with cruelty.”

As a result, the court was satisfied with the submission that the husband’s case fell in the definition of Section 13(1)(ia), which stipulates that any marriage solemnised may, on a petition of either a husband or wife, be dissolved by a decree of divorce on the ground that the other has treated the petitioner with cruelty.

The man had initially filed for annulment of marriage on the ground of impotence of the wife. The wife, thereafter, filed her written statement to his annulment petition and alleged that he was suffering from erectile dysfunction. He subsequently amended his petition and sought divorce on the ground of cruelty owing to the wife’s allegations in her written statement in response to his initial petition.

The argument about the man’s potence was brought up by the wife in her written statement and during his cross examination , where it was suggested that he did not consummate the marriage owing to erectile dysfunction. The wife also alleged that despite knowing about their son’s condition, her in-laws hid it from her. “This lends credence to the fact that the respondent (wife) had persisted to humiliate and wound the feelings of the petitioner,” noted the court.

To prove his potency, the husband’s counsel examined a sex expert as a witness, who concluded that the husband “had no problem of impotence”. The wife’s allegation of impotence were termed “false and malicious”.

138,['15/03/2020'],Covid-19 helpline officials find ittough to deal with ‘flu patients’,"Bareilly: “I have sneezed a dozen times, I want to give my sample for coronavirus test. Please guide me on how my sample can be collected,” said a caller to the staff of the helpline number of novel coronavirus (Covid-19) in Bareilly. It is not a lone instance as the helpline number here has been flooded with calls with people suffering from fever or cold or cough – all volunteering to give their samples for coronavirus test.

“They are often rattled and we make efforts to calm them down,” an official said. Officials said samples of those people are being collected who has travelled abroad or came in contact with suspicious cases. Officials said people should not panic and consult nearest doctor as most of the cases are of influenza.

On Saturday, district epidemiologist Dr Meesam Abbas said, “The spread of novel coronavirus has created panic among a section of people. A few people who are suffering from common cold or fever want to get tested for Covid-19. However, people who have returned from abroad or came in contact with suspicious cases are at risk of novel coronavirus, if symptoms of fever and cold appear in them. We have been getting many calls daily from people volunteering to give their samples. It takes time to pacify them and we recommend them to visit their nearest doctor. We even received calls from other states, including Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan.”

Apart from helpline number, people with fever or cold are also turning up at district hospital with demand of getting tested.

Dr Vageesh Vaish, senior consultant and physician at district hospital, said, “Due to lack of awareness, people think that if they have fever or respiratory disorder, it could be novel coronavirus. A 28-year-old man who recently returned from Mumbai came to district hospital on Saturday as he wanted to get tested for Covid-19 after he had fever. I asked him to come again on Monday. In such cases, we refer these people to rapid response team which has been constituted in every district for novel coronavirus. The members of rapid response team will examine the patient and will take a call if sample needs to be collected or not.”

139,['15/03/2020'],Telangana high court sets aside 2017 order on Transco jobs,"Representative Image

HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court has made it clear that transmission corporations of AP and Telangana cannot act in a whimsical manner by mutually agreeing to silently bury notifications for recruitment of electrical sub-engineers, linemen etc., posts issued by their parent organisation AP Transco in 2011 and 2012.

Pronouncing its judgement in a batch of pleas filed by selected candidates , a bench, comprising Justice M S Ramachandra Rao and Justice K Lakshman, has set aside the 2017 recruitment notification issued by TS Transco and asked it to first complete recruitment process initiated in 2011 and 2012, which were later abandoned conveniently by AP and Telangana Transcos.

On December 15, 2011, AP Transco had issued a direct recruitment notification for filling 339 posts of sub-engineers (electrical). The authorities had conducted written examination for qualified and eligible candidates on April 15, 2012. Of the 339 posts, 133 posts were for Telangana area of the then composite state of AP and the rest, 206 posts, for the Andhra area. The posts were to be filled up on 20% open and 80% local quota basis. Another notification for filling up nearly 1,700 lineman posts too was issued by AP Transco in 2012.

For those already working on contract basis, 45 weightage marks was given. Later, on the direction from the high court, the weightage was reduced to 20%. This litigation was the reason for delay in completing the recruitment process and, in the meantime, the state got divided on June 2, 2014. Subsequently, TS Transco and AP Transco emerged as new entities. In display of a strange bonhomie, the two power utilities agreed to abandon the composite era’s notifications and start recruitment afresh in their respective areas. However, the candidates, who almost bagged jobs in the previous process, were now the aggrieved lot because they are not eligible to participate in the fresh recruitment because they crossed the age limit.

The bench went through their pleas and held that the action of the present authorities was wrong. “We hold that though there is no vested right in the candidates selected in the qualifying exam for getting appointed to notified posts, the state cannot cancel the recruitment process arbitrarily without any bona fide or appropriate reasons. If the state does so, it cannot argue that the aggrieved candidates cannot be granted any relief,” the court said.

The bench also looked at argument of lapsed notifications because the old zones were non-existent and their misleading argument that a previous order allowed them to go ahead with their plans. “It is shocking that both TS Transco and AP Transco acted as if this court gave a licence to them to cancel the previous selections. What the previous bench said was only to ignore an earlier direction to hold the written test afresh in view of change in the weightage marks. This in no way can be interpreted as a licence to abandon the whole process”, the bench said in its judgment while asking TS Transco to issue appointment letters to all the selected candidates in the previous recruitment process.

140,['15/03/2020'],Dy CM announces PG course at regional referral hospital,"Nashik: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar has announced that a PG medical course will be started at the Nashik ’s regional referral hospital.

District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal said Pawar, who is also the finance minister, had made this announcement at a budget discussion in the state assembly on Saturday.

Bhujbal had been following up on the issue of starting a PG medical course at the regional referral hospital. He had also called on state medical education minister Amit Deshmukh, public health minister Rajesh Tope and other senior officials at the ministerial level to press for the issue.

Rajesh Tope had then been to Nashik to check the regional referral hospital. However, despite all this, there was no mention of the PG course in Nashik in the state budget announced recently.

Bhujbal brought the matter to the deputy CM’s attention. Subsequently, Pawar made the announcement during a discussion on the state budget on Saturday.

According to the initial plan, 100 seats would be created for the PG courses in Nashik. The premises of two government-managed hospitals in Nashik city — the civil hospital and the regional referral hospital — would be used for teaching the PG students.

Despite Nashik being a geographically huge district, there is no government medical college here. This has led to the Nashik civil hospital being overburdened.

For most medical problems, people from financially weaker sections have to come to the Nashik civil hospital. As a result, the 540-bed hospital is overcrowded around the year. Due to the lack of infrastructure, patients often have to be sent to Mumbai for further treatment.

Senior health officials said that once the PG courses start at the regional referral hospital, most of the speciality treatments can be performed at the hospital level, instead of referring the patients to Mumbai and Pune.

The regional referral hospital — which currently provides medical services to patients suffering from cancer, kidney and heart-related ailments — also has patients coming from across North Maharashtra.

142,['15/03/2020'],Bicholim locals want checks to rein in poaching,"Bicholim: Villagers from Bicholim have called for proper checks to be enforced by the forest department to curb incidents of poaching in the area.

The demand comes after Vhavati villager Santosh Govekar died of an accidental gunshot while on a hunting expedition with a companion in a nearby forest on Tuesday evening. His companion, Anand Gawade had fired at a mouse deer. However, the shot mistakenly hit Govekar, severely injuring him.

Vaikunth Gaonkar, a resident of Karapur, had met with a near identical death while on a hunt at Kulan around 15 years ago.

Tuesday’s incident could have been averted, villagers said, if the forest guard posted in Bicholim town to maintain vigil had taken the necessary precautions.

Another incident of poaching is believed to have occurred in the same area around one week ago.

Many wild animals have fallen victim to traps that have been laid by poachers over the past several years, including a leopard at Latambarcem.

CHENNAI: Residents of Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Thiruvananthapuram have become extremely cautious about attending public gatherings and social functions as part of measures to curb the spread of Covid-19. In Chennai, however, life is normal either due to ignorance or indifference, encouraged largely by the Tamil Nadu government’s reassurance that all is well.

Saturday in the city was like on any other weekend. The government and health experts may have advised people against going to large gatherings and to maintain at least three meters distance between one another, but huge crowds thronged Ranganathan Street and other shopping hubs in T Nagar.

At most malls, some wore masks but a large majority was content with washing hands or using the sanitiser at the security check.

""Malls and theatres are functioning as usual. So, people will visit,"" said Arun Kumar, who was at a mall. ""I am keeping myself safe, but I don’t think the situation in Chennai warrants a complete shutdown,"" he added. Such confidence seems to stem from the absence of any proactive preventive measures by the state.

Going by the way in which passengers are screened at Chennai airport, the authorities should be more cautious, said an official with an airline.

On Friday, a passenger who arrived from the Netherlands was out of the airport in a jiffy as there was very little screening in terms of questions and health checks.

""The authorities are depending on self-declaration by passengers. Detailed questions are asked and quarantine being advised only if the traveller is from China or Italy,"" said an official.

C Jeshma, a student, said she was avoiding unnecessary travel and was not going to malls. ""I am taking all precautions. I am using a sanitiser and washing my hands frequently,"" she said, adding that is better to be safe. ""The state government can be a little more strict.""

Authorities at railway stations have been doing their bit, disinfecting the premises regularly, while star hotels check temperature of visitors.

Chennai metro rail plans to disinfect its stations at the airport and near Central station for two days after services for the day are completed.

Still, the level of precautions has not reached the scale of efforts being taken in neighbouring capital cities. For instance, all theatres, malls and pubs in Bengaluru are shut till March-end.

As the CMRS will conduct trials on March 17 and 18, the JMRC officials are burning midnight oil to complete the preparations.

According to officials, the now-complete stations have all the advanced features. Alongside the large staircase, there is a ramp for the differently abled which connects to an elevator to the non-paid area on the concourse level.

On the safety front, the station has passenger screen doors, CCTV cameras, neon signs, digital information display boards, ticket-vending machines, automatic fare collection gates, customer care booths and a hi-tech station control room. Tactile paths have been laid at entry and exit points for visually impaired passengers.

The underground corridor, which is expansion of Phase-I (Mansarovar to Chandpole), is expected to be operational after receiving the CMRS nod.

The JMRC officials believe there will be increase in ridership after the Phase IB) is operational. In the absence of Phase IB, the performance of Phase IA of Jaipur Metro was ‘poor’ as the average ridership dipped. “At present, an average 20,000 passengers commute through Metro daily, as against the projected figure of one lakh. But Phase-II is expected to boost the numbers,” said a senior official

We are repeatedly announcing we are open from morning till night, still people fear closure,” said the manager. D’Mart is checking staffers’ temperature every day and has ordered testing kits for customers too but stocks are unavailable.Interestingly, none of the customers admitted they were hoarding. “But what if manufacturers are unable to despatch stocks later on? Flights have been cancelled so other transportation may also slow down. One has to be cautious,” said Tajunnissa Marker from Versova who bought several packs of cooking oil. Mumtaz from Millat Nagar said she believed this store would not close, “but one cannot be sure of other cities and road transport. It could have a cascading effect on us,” she said.Large-scale buying unfolded from Churchgate to Mira Road, Navi Mumbai to Thane. Star Bazar in Churchgate saw shelves devoid of essentials like rice, dal and noodles. D’Mart in Manpada, Thane, ran out of ghee and milk. “Still there were long queues at the bill counter. Everyone was buying too much of everything,” said shopper Chitra Mehta. At Raghuleela Mall opposite Vashi station, there were just a dozen people in the food court while the multiplex was shut. Online shoppers of food chains reported shortage too. “Too many items are sold out and I got a delivery slot for Monday,” said Thane’s Yamini Rao.Curiously, people did not mind visiting overcrowded supermarkets but stayed away from stations and buses.

An Ahmednagar resident — who had returned to India from one of the coronavirus-affected countries on March 1 — tested positive for the virus. The samples of three of his family members have, however, tested negative.

The administration, led by the collector, and medical officers including civil surgeon Pradeep Murambikar, NMC health officer Anil Borge, swung into action and the tracked down all the people who had come in contact with this patient.

The person who tested positive has now been moved to an isolation ward on the premises of the civil hospital. Initially, he had not shown any symptoms, but he came to the civil hospital because of his travel history. His samples were then sent to the NIV.

His condition is currently stable.

“As of now, we have one patient who has contracted the virus. Three others have tested negative. We have sent 16 more samples of swabs to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune for testing,” the collector said.

Eight persons who were associated with the patient, and eight others who had voluntarily come to the hospital to get themselves tested have now been quarantined, the officer added.

Among the people quarantined is also the person who recently came from Italy, the officer added.

All these persons will be under observation until the reports come negative.

Four more persons have been put under self-isolation at their homes, the officer added.

According to the officer, a 30-bed isolation ward has been set up at the civil hospital at Ahmednagar to ensure that patients suffering from other ailments do not come in touch with these patients.

A separate arrangement to quarantine people from the high-risk groups has also been set up by the medical staff.

The collector has appealed to people to not panic and stay away from rumours.

“A system is in place and people do not need to worry. All they have to do is maintain personal hygiene,” the officer added.

156,['15/03/2020'],CAG slams RCDF for slipping on milk procurement target,"Jaipur: The state, which had set a target of 50 lakh kg of milk procurement by 2020 under the livestock development policy announced in 2010, did not support it with necessary planning and financial assistance, points out the recent CAG report.

Rajasthan is having the second largest livestock population and milk production with 12.72% share in the country. During 2017-18, 1.65 crore milch animals produced 2.24 crore tonnes of milk in the state.

According to data in the year 2017-18, the state had 834 grams per capita per day availability of milk against 375 grams per day availability of milk in the country.

However, according to the CAG report, the Rajasthan Cooperative Dairy Federation ( RCDF ), which is the apex body of the three-tier cooperative structure in the state, could only procure a small fraction of the milk produced as it could neither expand its capacity of processing milk nor provide remunerative price to the dairy farmers.

The farmers thus preferred to sell their produce directly in the market than selling it through the cooperative body.

RCDF had approved in 2014 a ‘Vision Document 2020’ aimed at achieving a collection of 40 lakh litres of milk per day and marketing of 35 lakh litres by the same year.

The report said the targets set by the RCDF were not in consonance with that of the livestock policy of 2010 (target of 50 lakh kg of milk) as RCDF prepared its vision document independently without consulting the animal husbandry department. Further, the target is also inadequate in terms of surplus production in the state and in terms of the national average procurement achieved by cooperatives across the country.

The report further said, “No market survey was carried out by RCDF for increasing procurement, processing and marketing of milk. The report found RCDF execution and monitoring of dairy sector schemes and internal control mechanism inadequate.”

Dairy plant at Khetri incomplete

The RCDF dairy project with a capacity of 25,000 litres of milk per day at Khetri in Jhunjhunu district is still incomplete. The Rs 6.5 crore project was launched in 2013. RCDF had executed an MoU with Rajasthan Avas Vikas and Infrastructure Ltd (RAVIL) for the civil work and scheduled completion by February 2014.

The CAG report said RAVIL completed the civil work with a delay of three years in July 2017.

RCDF in 2017 demanded additional funds of Rs 3.4 crore from the state government due to cost escalation. But the amount was not sanctioned till August 2018. RCDF also did not make efforts to supplement the shortfall. As a result, the plant could not be made operational.

157,['15/03/2020'],Pandemic spanner in Yogi@3 mega event?,"Lucknow: The coronavirus scare and sudden inclement weather over past two weeks are likely to throw the spanner in UP government’s elaborate plans of holding big celebrations to mark its third anniversary.

Sources said alternative plans are being drawn up since chief minister Yogi Adityanath has himself recommended restrictions on public meetings.

Initially, it had been planned that CM Yogi would hold a press briefing in Lucknow on March 18 to mark the completion of three years in power and list the achievements of his government and then spend the next six days travelling across the state and meeting people and professional groups like doctors, chartered accountants and traders.

Similarly, all the ministers, MLAs and MPs were also scheduled to visit districts and hold meetings to apprise the people with the government’s achievements in last three years.

“There may be restrictions on public events in light of the coronavirus threat, and so there may be greater stress now on distribution of booklets with details of works of all MLAs. The booklets with data on development and welfare schemes will be released to mark the event,” said a senior BJP functionary.

Sources said CM Yogi may now address gatherings in 10-12 districts, while ministers, MLAs and MPs may hold press conferences, but the programme may change since the situation on both coronavirus and weather fronts has been changing rapidly, said an official.

The ruling party leaders and senior officials are keeping a watch on changing weather while charting out alternative plan.

“We witnessed unexpected heavy rains, strong winds and hail storms. We had not anticipated such weather, but now we will have to draw up programme for anniversary celebrations keeping this factor in mind,” he said, while adding that the CM’s public engagements over next couple of weeks are also being reassessed.

“We do not want to create any panic and the CM would definitely not want to cancel events unnecessarily. However, the situation is fluid and decisions will be taken close to the dates of planned events,” the official said.

161,['15/03/2020'],‘Virus fear’ spurs dhamaka cuts on chicken prices,"A shop selling chickens await customers in the city on Saturday

Vadodara: Desperation among poultry farmers go viral with messages like “Sunday dhamaka offer. Chicken 1kg live Rs 30 and cutting Rs 50 only!” being circulated on social media platforms which is being circulated widely along with picture of a healthy chicken and the address and phone number of the shop.

Demand for poultry dropped drastically in wake of the Coronavirus scare.

While even the National Egg Co-ordination Committee (NECC) issued an ad in public interest claiming there is no connection between the chicken and the dreaded pandemic so far, such is the fear psychosis, that even avid meat lovers are avoiding the fowl.

The drastic fall in prices can be gauged from the fact that live chicken which was sold earlier for amount between Rs 140 and Rs 160 per kilo, was on Saturday being offered at Rs 35 by bigger dealers in the city.

Sarfaraz Qureshi, a chicken trader in the city, said: “Despite the glut in the market, we have cut down prices drastically to ensure that consumption goes up. Once people start eating chicken owing to low prices and find it harmless, we can then revise the prices later.”

Even poultry farm owners have pressed the panic buttons and are selling chicken at a much younger age and lower weight. “We used to supply 40-day-old fowls, which weighed around 2kg. Today, we are even selling month-old chicks weighing 1.5kg only. The demand has gone down to one-fourth of what it was before the outbreak,” lamented Faruk Patel, who owns poultry farms in Bharuch and Anand districts.

Patel pointed out that even the one-month-old chicken consumes around 2.5kg feed during the time it spends at the poultry farm. At a cost of around Rs 30 per kilogram, the chicken would consume feed worth around Rs 75 in the farm. “Leave the feed apart, we are not even able to take care of wages of workers from our sales,” Patel said.

Dealers believe that the aggressive pricing is already bringing customers back. “Today we managed to sell around 1,100 chickens against an average of 1,500 earlier. This is not bad considering the severe downfall in demand we witnessed in the past few days. The small shops were not willing to cut prices and sold high rates. We decided to get into retail sales on our own to push demand,” said Ahmedraza Qureshi, a wholesale dealer.

The dealers, however, fear that with poultry farms not rearing chicken in desired amounts the prices may become exorbitantly high once demand soars again.

Pattern change

AHMEDABAD: The state government is mulling to make spitting in public places a punishable offence, said Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary, health and family welfare, in an interaction on Saturday. The decision is taken in the light of the fact that COVID-19 is found to be spreading through droplets, said the IAS officer.“We are discussing ways to ban spitting at public places with the district collectors, municipal commissioners and municipality chief officers through video link. We are also discussing how to penalize spitting, which can be a cause of coronavirus spread,” said Ravi.Ravi said that the state has introduced Gujarat Epidemic Diseases (COVID-19) Regulations, 2020 based on Indian Epidemic Act, 1897. Through the notification, authorised officials from the state health department, district collectors and municipal commissioners, will be empowered to take necessary action to prevent spread of COVID-19.“There is no epidemic currently in Gujarat and fortunately we have not reported any positive case. However, during our drive to ensure quarantine of the suspected cases, a few of the instances were reported where the persons had resisted the action necessary for ensuring public safety. The regulation will prevent leave or discharge against medical advice,” said Ravi.Health department officials said that initiatives such as keeping a close contact with the passengers coming back from the affected countries and regions are taken. The teams of health department are taking physical and telephonic follow-up of all the cases, said officials.Answering a question on whether schools will be closed down in the wake of alert like a few neighbouring states, Ravi said that the WHO experts have said that move such as closing the schools won’t help in preventing transmission. “Even in countries like the US and the UK, such steps are not taken. Wherever such steps are taken, they are taken in context of a case. We will also review the situation from time to time,” she said.She added that there are no directives so far to close down tourist attractions in the state. “We are in close contact with the central authorities and are monitoring the developments. We don’t want to create any panic,” said Ravi, adding that they are mulling to get temperature guns for screening at major government offices.Time taken to process samples for identification of COVID-19 infection has got reduced after establishment of a lab at BJ Medical College in Ahmedabad. Earlier, the samples were sent to Pune-based National Institute of Virology .

Lucknow: Stepping up its efforts to check the spread of novel coronavirus (Covid-19), the prisons department plans to distribute over 500 masks manufactured by inmates of Mathura jail among prisoners across the state.

The move comes after 12 persons in the state prisons department tested positive for Covid-19. The masks were manufactured by the inmates on Saturday.

Director general of prisons Anand Kumar said 55 of the 71 jails in state have the facility to manufacture masks designed as per recommendations of government doctors.

“We have asked for in-house trainers to manufacture masks with the available resources. If there is a shortage of raw materials, we will arrange for more from markets,” said Kumar. He also said that while wearing a mask isn’t a sure shot way to curb a contagion, but it is instrumental in maintaining hygiene.

“In the remaining 16 prisons which do not have the required manufacturing set-up, we have asked jailers to arrange for masks from outside and then distribute it among prisoners,” Kumar added.

“We have also directed jail wardens to organise sensitisation drives in prisons to spread awareness about Covid-19 and send daily updates to the headquarters. There are adequate arrangements to shift prisoners with prolonged illness to district hospitals.”

District prisons in Barabanki, Ghaziabad, Firozabad and Gautam Buddh Nagar also started manufacturing masks on Saturday.

Last week, jailors in 71 operations prisons were directed to install hand sanitiser dispensers on premises and distribute additional soaps among inmates. They were also asked to ensure that they maintain a distance of at least a metre while interacting. UP jails have more than 1.03 lakh prisoners.

Expert View: Shital Pampattiwar

For the ICSE X chemistry exam , thoroughly studying the textbook is necessary to gain deeper understanding of the subject. Students are advised to unhurriedly peruse all the chapters at least once.

To get an idea of the question paper, students should refer previous year’s papers. The question paper is divided in two parts — sections A and B. To score good marks in section A, the chapter on practical chemistry is very important.

For questions on organic chemistry, students must write the full structural formula for each compound.

Students should pay heed to the variations taking place in atomic radius, ionization potential and electron affinity in the periodic table. They should attempt all the numerical problems, as most problems are based on direct application of formulae, and students can score easily good marks.

Rajkot: A team of Junagadh crime branch on Saturday went to the villages of Dahod district and nabbed a gang of thieves allegedly involved in two thefts reported from Manavadar of Junagadh district last year. The three accused arrested also confessed to 10 more thefts they had committed in different towns of Saurashtra region.

Police said the accused, Bhavsingh Damor (23), Vijay Minama (25) and Mayur Bhabhor (26), were arrested for their alleged involvement in the theft of Rs 90,000 cash from a factory on Mitadi Road in Manawadar on the night of December 30 last year and stealing Rs 12,000 cash from a mill in the same area during the same time period.

The police ascertained the identities of the accused on the basis of the CCTV footage of the crime. Meanwhile, the cops received a tip-off that the accused were hiding in their villages in Dahod.

“Acting on this information, we went to Sandhawada village of Garbada taluka and nabbed Bambhor from there. Then we raided the house of Minama in Ambali village of Garbada taluka and arrested him from there. Thereafter, we went to the house of Damor in the same village and caught him from there,” said R K Gohel, inspector with Junagadh crime branch.

During interrogation, the trio initially stuck to their statement that they had not committed the thefts. However later, they broke down and confessed to the crimes.

The police have recovered Rs 70,000 cash and three cellphones worth Rs 6,500 from the accused. Apart from the two thefts in Manavadar, the accused confessed to having committed 10 more thefts in Manavadar, Kodinar, Somnath, Veraval, Gondal, Keshod and Savarkundla.

166,['15/03/2020'],"After Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat MLAs herded to Rajasthan","Congress legislators from Gujarat arrive at the Jaipur International Airport on Saturday

JAIPUR: Political tourism is at its peak in Rajasthan . After Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh , it is now the turn of Gujarat Congress MLAs .

The Congress leadership has decided to shift its MLAs from Gujarat to Rajasthan fearing poaching by the BJP before the Rajya Sabha elections, sources said.

A batch of about 14 Congress MLAs from Gujarat arrived in Jaipur by flight on Saturday night. They are being lodged at a hotel on Jaipur-Delhi Road. Some more MLAs are expected to join them soon, sources said.

Congress, which was caught off guard after a section of MLAs loyal to former Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia sending their resignations to the speaker putting the Kamal Nath government on the brink of collapse, acted fast on Gujarat. It has decided to shift the MLAs from Gujarat to Jaipur as a precautionary measure as attempts were made by the BJP to lure the MLAs there before the Rajya Sabha polls, sources said.

Meanwhile, about 85 Congress MLAs, including some Independents from Madhya Pradesh who were shifted to Jaipur and have been putting up at two resorts for the last four days, will leave for Bhopal on Sunday morning.

Sources said they will fly out of Jaipur in a special flight in the morning for Bhopal as the Budget session of the Madhya Pradesh Assembly is scheduled to begin Monday. The MLAs have been visiting various tourist places in the state for the last two days. They returned to the resorts on Saturday evening.

Senior AICC general secretaries, Mukul Wasnik and Harish Rawat, were also camping with the MLAs in Jaipur.

Rajasthan played host to the Congress MLAs from Maharashtra during the drama played out during government formation there after then BJP ally Shiv Sena refused to play ball with BJP.

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday visited the resorts and interacted with the MLAs and senior leaders. In a brief interaction with the media, Gehlot lashed out at the BJP saying political parties shifting their MLAs to other states reflects the prevailing situation in the country.

Alleging an atmosphere of terror, Gehlot said, “If anyone expresses disagreement with the government, he is treated as traitor. Where is democracy left in this country and as I said earlier, horsetrading is being done shamelessly.” He alleged that the Congress MLAs in Bengaluru were held ‘captive’ and even close relatives were not allowed to meet them.

167,['15/03/2020'],SP rallies to focus on BJP failures on 22 fronts in state,"Lucknow: In the run up to 2022 assembly elections, Samajwadi Party will hold state-wide dharnas and cycle rallies on the 22nd of every month, starting April, to highlight the failure of BJP government on 22 issues. The protests and rallies, to be held at tehsil level, will be led by SP MLAs, MPs and other senior leaders.

A decision to this effect was taken at the party’s national executive meeting in Lucknow on Saturday where the leadership also discussed a “chargesheet” against BJP government at the Centre and in UP.

This was possibly for the first time ever since SP came into being that party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, his estranged younger brother Shivpal Yadav and party’s Muslim face Mohammed Azam Khan were missing from action at the same time. All three happen to be the founder members of the party.

The party, however, passed a resolution lambasting the BJP government for its politics of hate and cited police action against Azam Khan as an example.

The party condemned the manner in which police cases were lodged against Azam Khan. The party described FIRs as baseless and unfounded.

Speaking on the significance of 22nd day of every month, party secretary Rajendra Chaudhary said: “We will highlight 22 issues through these protests. Prior to this, a ‘cycle yatra’ will be held on March 23 to mark the birth anniversary of socialist ideologue Ram Manohar Lohia. We will reach out to people and tell them how BJP has failed on all fronts and is trying to portray development works of the SP government as its own achievement,” Chaudhary said.

169,['15/03/2020'],‘Add Divyang as prefix to a PWD’s name on voter list’,"Jaipur: National vice-president of Divyang Adhikar Mahasangh, Hemant Goyal, has written to the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) of Rajasthan urging him to insert the word ‘Divyang’ as prefix to the name of a person with disability (PWDs) on the voters’ list for better identification of the specially abled persons in the state.

The office of the CEO has forwarded the proposal to the Election Commission of India (ECI) for its perusal. In a separate letter, Goyal has written to the CEO urging him to draft guidelines for the political parties to ensure that interpreters are assigned in public meetings for assistance to the hearing-impaired persons, making arrangement for wheelchairs in these meetings, and that manifestos of the political parties must be published in Braille.

“I have not written to the political parties in this regard. If the ECI makes guidelines, they are bound to follow it. That’s why I have written to the CEO,” said Goyal, who is also a member of the state-level PWD committee, election department.

“Now, it is difficult to identify PWDs from the voters’ list. It will also help political parties easily identify the number of PWDs residing in several wards and constituencies. Therefore, I suggested that the word ‘Divyang’ must be added as prefix to the name of a person with disability,” he added.

There are around five lakh PWD voters in the state with a total population of around 16 lakh.

“Even as the names of about five lakh PWD voters have been enrolled in the voters’ list, their voting percentage in the state is low. So, this move will help identify the PWDs in the constituencies and also bring them to the polling booths enabling them to cast their votes. While the election department is taking several steps to increase their voting percentage, the political parties are giving them enough attention,” he added.

“While the drivers and conductors have already been told to maintain personal hygiene, the MSRTC has also decided to provide hand sanitizers to the passengers travelling on its semi-luxury buses,” Dileep Nalawade, the senior depot manager of Nashik-1, said.

The sanitizers will be kept in with the MSRTC drivers and the conductors, who will ask every passenger boarding the bus to clean their hands with the same. “Sanitizer’s effect lasts for about four hours. Therefore, once during every trip is sufficient for the passengers,” the MSRTC officer added.

The other instructions pertain to the cleanliness of the buses, the bus stands and the lavatories on the premises.

“The central office has instructed the depots to ensure the cleanliness of the MSRTC buses and the premises. The bus drivers and conductors have been told to maintain personal hygiene to avoid contracting the virus,” the officer said.

The MSRTC had given the cleanliness contract to a private organization, but the agreement was discontinued after a payment issue cropped up between the administration and contractor.

“Currently, our staff is maintaining the cleanliness. This will continue till we get adequate manpower on a contract basis,” the officer said.

The buses are washed from inside as well. “In the current senario, we are using recommended cleaners to sanitize the head and hand rests as well as the handle bars,” he added.

The staff — especially the drivers, conductors, controllers, cleanliness workers — who have direct contact with the passengers have been asked to be very careful. “The drivers and conductors have been specially asked to maintain distance of one metre and told not to touch their faces without washing their hands after exchanging tickets, money and other things,” the officer said.

While BS-VI variants are more expensive than BS-IV ones, BS-VI variants have not yet been rolled out for all models by all companies and availability is thus an issue. All these factors slowed sales down,” said Rajnish Arora, CEO of a dealership in the city.Similarly, two-wheeler sales declined by 6.6% from 84,300 in February 2019 to 78,711 last year. Car sales in Gujarat, with a 12.4% decline, had a much steeper fall than the 1.1% decline in sales across India.“The slowdown situation continues and therefore there is no sentimental buying; only those needing new vehicles are investing in one.

We hope sales revive soon,” said Pranav Shah, director, Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA), Gujarat.Rural sales have taken a big hit industry players say. “Rural demand for vehicles has slowed significantly.

Complainant Nagesh Ghughardare approached the court earlier this month after Vadodara taluka police station did not register his FIR despite him filing a complaint last month.

In his complaint Ghughardare stated that he received a random email from ‘La Manpower Services’ which promised him a job with Rs 1.4 lakh salary and incentives. When Ghughardare showed readiness, he was contacted by a man named Joseph D’Souza who asked him to pay money citing various reasons. Within a short span Ghughardare ended up paying Rs 1 crore in bank accounts of three other accused Nilofar Baig, Bhushan Kamble and Sajjad Baig.

The victim was told the amount will be refunded once he gets the job.

On December 12 last year, Ghughardare was contacted by another accused Rohan Mane to inform that his application for the job has been rejected. However, four days later he again received an email from D’Souza asking him to pay Rs 15 lakh for verification purpose. Ghughardare then asked D’Souza to refund the entire amount that he had paid so far. But when he was asked for some time, the complainant became suspicious and went to meet P J Kharsan, senior sub-inspector of Vadodara taluka police station.

Ghughardare was asked to wait for some days, but when the money was not refunded till February, he submitted an application with the police to register an offence on February 7. For over a month the police did not not take any action forcing Ghughardare to move court.

The court on March 12, asked the police to register an FIR and investigate the case in accordance with the law. However, till late Saturday evening, police did not register any case in this regard.

As the Supreme Court stayed the Rajasthan high court’s order - that cancelled the notifications reorganising gram panchayats and panchayat samitis after November 15-16 - on January 8, the nomination papers of those gram panchayats affected by the order were kept in sealed envelopes.

“Of the 1,119 gram panchayats, 707 gram panchayats are unaffected by the delimitation notification issued by the panchayati raj department after November 15-16. The reservation to these posts also remains intact,” State Election Commissioner P S Mehra had earlier said.

“There is no legal hurdle in completing the election to the posts of sarpanch and panch posts in these gram panchayats. Hence, it has been decided by the commission to complete their election process. The remaining 412 gram panchayats are either affected by reorganization or reservation of seats. It was not possible to release its schedule now. Therefore, it has been decided to withdraw the notification issued for these panchayats,” Mehra had added.

180,['15/03/2020'],Blind candidates asked to identify photos in GSHSEB exam,"Image used for representational purpose only

AHMEDABAD: Blind candidates were unable to attempt two questions worth a total of seven marks in the Class X social studies exam. This was because they needed to identify photographs for them.

Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) chairman A J Shah will soon decide on what remedial action will be taken to make sure that blind students do not suffer injustice, a source said.

“How can the authorities make such a blunder? We made a representations to the board. They promised us corrective action,” said Vinod Naik, the parent of a Class X student. The social studies exam was held on March 13.

In all, 5,600-odd disabled students are taking the Class X board exams this year, of these, 3,000 candidates are blind. “We received complaints from parents and will take a decision on the matter. There is a separate centre for evaluation of exam papers of blind candidates. We will communicate our decision directly to the centre based on which the evaluation will be done,” said a board official. Shah did not respond to calls made to his mobile phone.

There have been similar instances in the past, where the board later decided in favour of the blind candidates.

Question number 36 had a black and white picture and asked students to identify the popular foodgrain of India and write a descriptive note on it. This question was worth four marks. Question number 30, worth three marks, asked students to identify the picture of a famous university.

In the section where other students were asked to identify spots on a map, the paper for blind candidates had a different set of questions.

181,['15/03/2020'],Godavari Express gets LBH Coach,"Nashik: The Manmad-LTT Godavari Express , much like the Pune-Mumbai Deccan Express, will have the Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches for passengers.

While the Manmad-Mumbai Panchavati Express already has had rake from the LHB family since May 1, 2018, the internal designs of the coach have been unsatisfactory. Passengers have been demanding a change.

The new coach has been manufactured by the Modern Coach Factory (MCF) at Raebareli. The ones provided to the Panchavati Express were manufactured by Indian Coach Factory in Chennai.

The 17-coach composition of the train, with two head-on generation (HOG) vans, will be run by the Railways on Monday, March 16, the railway officials confirmed.

The new rake has been designed keeping in mind the passenger demands. The demands include facing-seats, instead of single-direction seats, more leg space, comfortable bench seats (instead of bucket seats) and increased aeration by proper window-seat alignment.

“We welcome the Railways’ decision. We have not seen the new rake, but believe it is not similar to the one in the Panchavati Express,” said Rakesh Patil, a regular train commuter.

Sharvari Panse, another commuter, said: “In the Panchavati Express, poor leg space, bad aeration and uncomfortable backrests add to passenger woes.” She wondered if the Railways was considering changing the rakes of the Panchavati Express. “The demand of Panchavati passengers is an old one. Besides, it has higher numbers of passengers. It would be better if the Railways improved the Panchavati train’s rake first,” Panse said.

The Railway authorities said the new rake, now at the Manmad Junction yard, had all that people expected. “The rake for Godavari Express is a different one. People will be more comfortable,” the Railway officer said. About changes in the Panchavati Express, he said it was not possible right now.

Expert View: Ragini Deshraj

Science 1 can seem intimidating if you have a lot to revise; hence it is prudent to study systematically by focusing on different topics in the right sequence.

Students should master the art of balancing chemical equations and memorize the application of acids, bases, and salts thoroughly. You must know the names, preparation, chemical formulae, usage of salts and their compounds.

Carbon compounds and their nomenclature — containing functional groups should be well prepared. Students should also focus on the modern periodic table with electronic configuration, and memorize all the elements placed in the first and the last two groups.

Focus on attempting all the questions that are necessary. Scientifically correct diagrams with proper labelling should be drawn, wherever required. This creates the impression that you are well versed with the syllabus .

Diagrams like electric circuit, AC and DC generator, image formation by lens, lines of magnetic field around the solenoid and bar magnet , human eye, glass prism, image formation of defected and corrected vision, myopia and hypermetropia should be practised. Drawing practice of diagrams is imperative for remembering them well.

Solving question papers gives a good understanding about the type of questions asked. I would suggest students to solve the question papers as many times as possible.

AHMEDABAD: Continuing its plunge, gold prices continued to fall for the fourth consecutive day on Saturday. Yellow metal price stood at Rs 42,400 per 10 gram in the Ahmedabad market on Saturday, falling by Rs 700 against Friday’s Rs 43,100 per 10 gram. According to analysts, increased selling of gold coupled with profit-booking caused the decline in gold prices.

“With the recent crash of the stock market, investors have sold off a lot of gold to compensate for losses. This coupled with profit-booking in gold has caused gold price in the local market to decline further,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA).

A week ago, gold price touched the record high of Rs 46,100 per 10 gram in Ahmedabad market. Gold prices have shown a rise in the international market due to fears of slowdown in global trade due to coronavirus outbreak.

Even though gold prices have declined, the demand for yellow metal has ceased to increase, leaving jewellers and stockists, worried. “There is a lot of fluctuation in gold prices, due to which both consumers and investors are in wait and watch mode, because of which demand has failed to pick up,” said a city-based jeweller without willing to be named.

Rajkot: Summer is yet to set in but Rajkot has already started feeling its impact. With chief minister Vijay Rupani’s hometown already facing water scarcity, the civic body has sent an appeal to the state government to provide water in Aji-1 and Nyari-1 dams under the SAUNI scheme. Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) said this will help continue uninterrupted supply of 20 minutes of water every day.

Rajkot city, whichrequires 280 MLD (million litres per day) water, claims that growing population is pushing up the city’s water needs. Last year, the city required 260 MLD water, which has increased to 280 MLD this year.

RMC has, in the meantime, demanded 600 to 800 mcft water.

In a statement, the water resources department said that pumping will start from Sunday onwards from Macchu dam. RMC officials are expecting to get the water by March 25.

RMC, which is dependent on Narmada water for five months of the year, will also require Narmada water till the arrival of monsoon this year. Despite having good rainfall last year, the city is facing shortage owing to lack of water storage facility.

There are two major reservoirs, Aji-1 and Nyari-1, which provide drinking water to the city that is also being fed by water from Bhadar-1. However, supply from the latter is limited to 40 MLD only as Bhadar water is kept reserved for Gondal and Dhoraji towns and for irrigation purposes. The water level in Aji-1 dam, which provides water to 60 percent area of the city, has gone down.

This is the only testing track in city apart from the one at Trichy West RTO. It is learnt that MVI posts are vacant in at least three other RTOs in the city.

Trichy district has three main RTOs, all falling under the city limits, while there are five unit RTOs in other parts of the district.

A driving test track was opened in January spending Rs 1 crore at the new campus of Thiruverumbur unit RTO at Navalpattu behind the Elcot IT park complex. Earlier, the unit RTO was operating without a testing track. However, the new facility has been not utilised to its full potential because of the absence of an MVI there. Since an MVI from Trichy East RTO is additionally overseeing Thiruverumbur unit RTO, driving tests happen only for 2-3 days in a week. This has prevented private players from setting up photocopying shops and other allied services near the Navalpattu campus.

“We pinned our hopes on the new RTO campus to bring development to Navalpattu. Movement of people to the RTO campus every day will attract small investments,” R Kathan, a retired health inspector from Anna Nagar, said. Now the facility is being used only on Tuesdays and Thursdays, sources said.

Besides Thiruverumbur unit RTO, MVI posts are vacant at Trichy East, Srirangam and Trichy West RTOs. Against the sanctioned strength of three MVIs at Srirangam and Trichy West RTOs, the two RTOs have only one MVI each. Similarly, Trichy East RTO has only one MVI against the sanctioned strength of two MVIs. “Recently, MVIs were appointed at Thuraiyur and Manapparai. We have requested to fill the vacancies in Thiruverumbur and city’s RTOs as well,” a senior official said.

CHENNAI: Sleuths from the bank fraud wing of the city police are searching for a key suspect, who had been running a fake call centre in the city and had conned more than 300 people .

Police had recently busted the racket by arresting at least 10 people, including Benze Saravanan, and VCK functionary Selvakumar. Police are in search of their accomplice Muneer. Inquiries revealed that Selvakumar and his friends lured young women by promising to get them loans and had sexually assaulted them after taking them to tourist places, including Mamallapuram and Puducherry. To ensure their victims did not find that they were conmen, they flaunted having privilege cards which were later found to be fake, an officer privy to the case details said. Police had seized about 200 fake privilege cards from their office.

During interrogation, Selvakumar, who was the mastermind, said he and friend Muneer, had been making such dubious calls for the past three years. Inquiry revealed that Selvakumar and Muneer had been working with another conman J S R Gopi Krishna, who was arrested for running a fake call centre in April last year. They had parted ways a few years back, after which Selvakumar and Muneer began their own racket.

An investigation officer said Gopi Krishna and 18 others were arrested by the bank fraud wing last year and believed that such fake BPO units had been curtailed with their arrest. While most of the 400 people, who had been employed by Gopi Krishna in several of his fake BPOs, had moved on to other ventures, at least a dozen of them have since began similar, smaller rackets, the officer said.

Like Gopi Krishna, the gang members spent the money they gained lavishly and frequented casinos in Thailand, Dubai and Hong Kong, a police department source said. Police suspected that the racketeers put together may have swindled more than Rs 100 crore from more than 2,000 people across Tamil Nadu. Police personnel are expecting more complaints from victims.

Two of the passengers in the vehicle died due to severe burn injuries. Cops claimed that this was a case of gang rivalry .

Shanti Lal, who was one of the victims and was critically injured, died on Monday while Ajit Singh succumbed to burn injuries on Friday late night. Two others who were also in the vehicle, suffered minor injuries.

The incident happened on February 8 when the four victims were sitting in their car and having tea around 4.30pm, the attackers poured petrol on the vehicle and set it afire.

Following this, cops arrested Govinddan Charan, Suresh Bishnoi, Subhash Bishnoi and Rejpal Bishnoi. The crime took place barely 150m from the Nokha police station

Nem Singh Chauhan, DCP, Nokha, said, “After the first victim succumbed to the burns, the case was updated from attempt to murder under IPC Section 307 to Section 302 for murder. Both the victims and the accused had a long criminal history and were members of rival gangs. This was a retaliation to a previous incident when the victims had attacked the accused.”

The attack took place in a lane parallel to Nokha police station while a Community Liaison Group meeting was being held there. Around six months ago, the victims had attacked one of the accused. According to sources, since then, the accused had been looking for an opportunity to avenge the attack. More arrests are likely in the case as the investigation unfolds further.

Thiruvananthapuram: DYFI activists have kick-started a voluntary blood-donation drive here to meet the shortage of blood in blood banks following Covid-19 scare. The drive is being carried out in the wake of voluntary blood donation getting hit since the virus spread in the state.

On Saturday, a group of more than 100 DYFI activists donated blood at the blood bank at Government Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram, kick-starting the drive. The drive has been launched as part of the Jeevadhara scheme of the DYFI district committee. The activists were led by DYFI state secretary A A Rahim, state committee member Suresh Babu, district president V Vineeth, district secretary K P Pramosh and district committee treasurer V Anoop.

Inaugurating the blood donation drive, Rahim said hospitals across the state are facing shortage of blood in their blood banks, especially those hospitals where isolation wards have been opened to observe suspected Covid-19 affected people. This is because people are reluctant to come anywhere near the hospitals out of fear of getting affected by the virus. Hence, this drive will be carried out across the state under the aegis of block committees for the next 19 days.

Rahim said the closure of educational institutions following Covid-19 spread has also affected voluntary blood donation in the state as majority of blood donors were college students. DYFI members are committed to ensure that blood banks in the state have sufficient blood in stock to meet emergency situations, he said, adding that DYFI’s initiative will also encourage more people to step forward for voluntary blood donation during this crisis period.

TOI had reported on Friday that there was a major dip in the number of voluntary blood donors ever since the virus spread and education institutions were closed down subsequently.

Health officials said that the passengers have been put under observation as a precautionary measure and they were trying to track the other 15 passengers.

According to the data released by the health department on Saturday, 80 passengers returned to Prayagraj after visiting countries like China, Hong Kong and Thailand since December 29. “While 47 were released after being put under a 28-day observation, 33 are quarantined at home,” the data said.

District epidemiologist Dr Anshu Vaishya said, “We have been keeping a strict watch on passengers returning from aboard. Currently, 33 such passengers are quarantined at home. The department has launched awareness drives in both rural and urban areas to sprea word about the preventive measures.”

On Thursday, the health department had received a fresh list of 35 travellers who visited some of the countries affected by novel coronavirus. The department traced and screened passengers to find out if they had been infected.

Till Saturday, India reported 82 cases of coronavirus. While no cases have been reported yet in Prayagraj, 11 persons have tested positive for Covid-19 in Uttar Pradesh till now.

Meanwhile, health officials have set up five help desks near Allahabad high court for visitors who might want to consult medical experts on coronavrious. A doctor and a pharmacist have been assigned to every help desk.

The district administration has already set up isolation wards in all four government hospitals in the city — Swaroop Rani Nehru Hospital (20 beds), Colvin Hospital (10 beds), Beli Hospital (10 beds) and Women’s Hospital (10 beds).

Meanwhile, stockists dealing in surgical equipments are struggling to meet the spike in demand of N95 masks as Prayagraj residents scurry to buy them to shield themselves from novel coronavirus.

Traders claimed that manufacturers have not only hiked the prices of these masks, but are also not willing to take back unsold stocks.

President of Allahabad Druggist and Chemist Association Anil Dubey said, “Stockists are shying away from procuring N95 masks from manufactures after the latter refused to take unsold stocks. If the masks are not sold, the stockists would have to suffer unnecessary losses. The manufacturers have also doubled the prices of these masks. The government should step in to ensure that adequate number of masks are being supplied to the market.”

The government has declared these items as essential commodities by amending the schedule of the Essential Commodities Act 1955. The decision empowers states to regulate production, quality and distribution of masks and hand sanitisers. Governments can carry out operations against order speculators and those involved in black marketing or overpricing. Offenders may be punished with an imprisonment of 7 years or fine or both.

The district judge was speaking at the inauguration of the 14th national-level Moot Trial and Judgement Writing Competition at N B Thakur Law College on Saturday, where students of 25 law-colleges across the country participated.

Subhash Ghatage, chairman of bar council Maharashtra and Goa, said there is an urgent need to have more young and fresh lawyers in the country. “Moot trials are vital for educating young and budding lawyers. They give a feel of the court premises and teach the students how to present a problem as a case,” he said.

He stressed about maintaining court etiquette, the importance of evidence and proofs for a perfect court case.

The 25 participating teams had three-members each, who presented their case as two lawyers and one judge. They were given real-life problems from the past five years, which they had to make into a valid case.

“Out of 25 teams, 10 had come from out of Maharashtra. It is a big annual event for us. We had prepared for a two-day event but due to the spread of Covid-19, we received the instructions to wind it up in one day itself,” said Shreyas Moharir, a member of the organising team from the college.

The body of Sharanya (20), daughter of Vijayan and Sasikala of Kottukal was found 1km off the coast of Pulimkudi near Vizhinjam.

Sharanya had gone missing in sea from Adimalathura beach along with two others on Friday afternoon. Her classmate Nisha (20), of Kidarakkuzhi and neighbourSharu (17), were the others. Nisha’s body was found in sea off the coast of Adimalathura on Friday night itself. She is the daughter of Surendran and Sarojini of Kidarakkuzhi. Sharanya’s body was shifted to the mortuary after completing inquest procedures. A postmortem examination will be conducted on Sunday.

Vizhinjam coastal police sub-inspector E Shanibas said a search is still on to find Sharu , who is still missing. She is the daughter of a policeman, Shammy, attached to Kanjiramkulam police station.

Besides the coastal police, units of marine enforcement and Indian Coast Guard too are conducting searches in the sea.

It is suspected that the girls accidentally fell into the sea when they reached the beach on Friday afternoon to have fun. Nisha had reached Sharanya’s residence on Friday around 1pm on her scooter and from there the trio proceeded to Adimalathura beach. The police registered a man-missing case after Nisha’s scooter was found near the beach on Friday evening. The mobile phones of the girls were found inside the storage space of the scooter.

Shanibas said that just like in the case of Nisha, Sharanya’s body too did not have any visible injuries, indicating that the deaths were accidental drowning.

“For the past few days, the sea here had been rough. A portion of the beach was under water owing to high tide, splitting the beach into two,” said the police officer, who had visited the beach as part of a routine patrolling on Friday morning, just hours before the alleged mishap.

He added that the beach was deserted owing to the adverse weather conditions. Not even local fishermen were on the beach.

The Vizhinjam police said that they were examining surveillance camera footages of a church nearby to see if there are any visuals of the mishap.

Sharanya and Nisha were second year BBA students of Malankara Catholic College, Kaliyikkavila near Parassala. Sharu was a Class XII student at Government Higher Secondary School, Kottukal.

Meantime, on Saturday, Nisha’s body was handed over to her family after postmortem. Her funeral was held on the same day.

Their results surprised the medical team.The infant had a rare condition, ‘situs inversus totalis’ which involves complete transposition (right to left reversal) of thoracic and abdominal organs. Usman’s heart is thus not in the usual position in the left of the chest, but on the right this is the case with his other organs too. This was not it. He had a second condition, diaphragmatic hernia , which resulted in the development of intestines on right side of his lung.Dr Rakesh Joshi, professor and head of paediatric surgery at Civil Hospital, said this was the first surgical procedure at the hospital during his tenure where an infant was found to have these conditions together. While diaphragmatic hernia is very unusual but not rare in newborns, mirrored organs are found in just 0.01% of the population, Joshi said.A team consisting of Dr Joshi, Dr Jaishri Ramji and other experts performed corrective surgery on February 28, to correct the hernia and restore the intestines to the lower abdomen. Usman was kept under observation for a fortnight and was discharged on Friday. The team said that he will come for a few follow-ups, but his his health is improving.“The first child of a cab driver, Usman was developing pneumonia.

These is in addition to basic preventive measures temperature screening and extensive use of hand sanitisers and masks.

Many companies have also begun conducting VPN load tests to ensure that a high number of employees can work from home if need be in the future. Most IT companies insist employees log onto VPN due to security reasons.

According sources, biggies like Google, Amazon, Flipkart, Qualcomm and Cognizant have already been encouraging WFH wherever possible for the next couple of weeks.

“We continue to work closely with public and private medical experts to ensure we are taking the right precautions as the situation continues to evolve. As a result, we are now recommending that all of our employees globally, who are able to work from home, do so through the end of March,” said an Amazon spokesperson.

Players like OpenText and Pegasystems have put in place odd-even and code systems to enable a part of their employees to work from home on a rotation basis. “Our organisation will be implementing an odd-even rule based on cubicle numbers from Monday,” said an employee of a company located at Raheja Mindspace.

An employee of IT giant Infosys said the company has suspended biometric attendance system and has reverted to the old ID card system and is encouraging WFH. “Like all IT companies we already have a WFH policy wherein we are allowed nine days WFH in a month provided one has been allotted an office laptop. With coronavirus spreading, the company has announced WFH as feasible,” the Infosys employee said.

228,['15/03/2020'],Ahmedabad: Manager accused of embezzling Rs 2.5 crore,"Representative image

AHMEDABAD: Rishabh Khanna, 39, of Randesan in Gandhinagar and assistant manager at Kalpataru Power lodged a complaint of cheating against his company’s project manager, Ashwinikumar Singh, on Friday.

According to the complaint, Singh has along with Ishwarchandra Garnayak, Lalitedu Parid, Pathak Engineering, Nimish Infrastructure, Bitan Deduri, and Keshar Enterprise siphoned off Rs 2,44,96,345 from Kalpataru.

According to the FIR, Singh joined the company in December 2014 as project manager. When the company got to work on the Paradip-Hyderabad pipeline, the project was given to Singh.

The FIR said the company set up temporary base in Behrampur in Odisha and provided Singh with machinery and other resources. However, Singh allegedly told the company that it would have to hire sub-contractors. Since October 2019, Singh sent account statements to the company and the company paid him the money.

According to the FIR, in November 2019 the company came to know about irregularities and summoned Singh to Gandhinagar. Singh confessed to the irregularities and promised to pay back the money.

However, the irregularities were of a much larger scale than Singh had confessed to and hence he was fired. According to the company, Singh and his accomplices allegedly siphoned off Rs 2,44,96,345.

Police officials said they have lodged an offence under Sections 406, 408, 420,120(b) and 506(2) against the accused named in the FIR.

Shrikant Shukla, the joint secretary of Ashoka Education Foundation, said, “We have prepared a video featuring our students explaining how to take precautions against coronavirus. We have shared it with all the parents to make sure that they do not send their children to school if they suffer from cold and cough.”

Schools will be able to implement the government instructions to shut down the schools if the need arises.

Ryan International School is sending its students to wash hands after every period and has put up posters on the school premises explaining how to wash hands regularly and cover their face while sneezing or coughing.

CHENNAI: Walking on the streets of north Chennai could soon become hassle-free as Chennai metro rail is laying new and wider footpath across a 9-km stretch. The stretch will link the metro service line between Washermenpet and Wimco Nagar, which is expected to be opened by mid-2020.

“The footpath is being laid across the entire 9km stretch instead of just in front of our stations. The pavement will be uniform across the stretch, making it easy for both our commuters and other pedestrians to walk along the road as well as access the metro stations,” said a Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) official.

The 9km phase-1 extension line between Washermenpet and Wimco Nagar , getting ready at a cost of Rs 3,770 crore, will have eight stations. It includes two underground stations — Theagaraya College and Korukkupet, and six elevated stations — Tondiarpet, Toll Gate, Thangal, Gowri Ashram, Tiruvottiyur and Wimco Nagar.

A metro rail official said the footpath being laid along the north Chennai metro line will be 2m wide with bollards and will look similar to the ones built around phase-1 metro stations. They are also maintained by CMRL.

Though the footpath laid around metro stations in phase-1 were within the land acquired for the construction of the stations, CMRL built footpath across a nearly 2km stretch on Second Avenue in Anna Nagar between Anna Nagar Roundtana and Thirumangalam.

“Our footpath may not look different from those laid by the city corporation and their width may be the same,” an official said.

While those laid within metro rail’s property is also used for setting up food stalls and kiosks, the pavement laid on Second Avenue, Anna Nagar, is mostly free of encroachment making it convenient for pedestrians.

Under phase 1, CMRL has built broader footpaths paved with interlocked tiles and broader tiles near its stations on Poonamallee High Road, Anna Salai and 100Feet Road though the roads belong to the state highways department. However, there is no uniformity in the footpaths along these stretches because metro’s footpath is only for a few metres on either side of the stations to help commuters access the stations. The footpaths are also of better quality when compared to the ones laid by corporation and the state highways.

Taking on YSRC, Kanna said that lawlessness is prevailing across the state. “With police remaining silent spectators to the atrocities being committed by the ruling party workers, conduct of free and fair elections has become a distant dream,” he said.

Kanna added that YSRC workers are on the prowl in Visakhapatnam and resorting to large scale land grabbing. He himself was the victim of land grabbing by ruling party men as his land and the land adjacent to his was occupied by them, he said.

Kanna further said even people from Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram are opposing the idea of three capitals and worried about their lands. He said the BJP is committed to the development of Amaravati as only capital to the state.

Sunil Deodhar said in his representation submitted to the governor that the candidates of opposition parties are not being allowed to file nominations in the local body elections.

Meanwhile, BJP functionaries staged protests in large numbers in front of the sub-collector’s office in Tirupati on Saturday demanding the state election commission (SEC) to intervene and take action against YSR Congress party for instigating attacks on the candidates of opposition parties during the nominations filing phase of the local bodies’ elections.

Hundreds of BJP activists, who squatted in front of the sub-collector’s office in the city, shouted slogans against YSRC for misusing power.

Speaking to reporters during the protests, BJP functionary G Bhanuprakash Reddy and Samanchi Srinivas pointed out that the BJP candidate for the 10th ward was chased away and physically assaulted by YSRC activists when he tried to file his nomination papers on Friday.

“Our senior party functionaries and MPs have already met Union home minister Amit Shah and appraised him of the unfortunate developments in the state, where the ruling party is making a mockery of democracy by resorting to all kinds of malpractices. We demand the SEC intervene at least now and ensure the conduct of free and fair elections by cracking the whip against erring ruling party leaders,” BJP functionaries demanded.

MUMBAI: Even as the Maha Vikas Aghadi ( MVA ) government aims to bring in a stringent law to curb cases of crimes against women, it has reduced the budgetary allocation for women and children welfare schemes by as much as 40% for the coming financial year.

The Gender Budget statement for 2020-21 was tabled in the state legislature on Saturday. While on one hand the statement expressed concerns over the steady rise in crimes against women, on the other, merely 1.8% or Rs 7,379 crore of the total state expenditure of over Rs 4 lakh crore has been allocated for their welfare in 2020-12.

Shambhuraj Desai, junior minister for finance, tabled the Gender Budget statement in the legislative council on the last day of MVA’s first budget session. It also referred to a National Crime Records Bureau report that Maharashtra recorded the second highest number of crimes against women in the country between 2016 and 2018.

Professor Vibhuti Patel at Advanced Centre for Women Studies, TISS, said, “Government grants are not being released for women’s study centres, which are being shut down.” Drawing attention to the fact that women make up 5.2 crore of the state’s 11.2 crore population, Patel said not just the state, even the union government should hike budgetary provisions.

He said women are still not given the status of “farmers”. They are deprived of ownership of vital documents without which they cannot avail of government schemes or subsidies.

CHENNAI: A 32-year-old Perambur resident was riding home with her son on Friday night in Perambur when a young man rode close to her, snatched her gold chain and sped away. Nandhini Deepakraj, the victim, immediately gave chase on her scooter through a warren of lanes, screaming for help all the way, and helped nab him.

A team of the Sembium police arrived and took Allauddin, a third year student of an arts and science college in Arumbakkam, to the station. A court sent him to jail on Saturday.

A police officer said Nandhini, an MBA holder, had taken her seven-year-old son D Jeevan to the Murasoli Maran park near Perambur railway station and was returning home on her scooter when Allauddin snatched her gold chain near Palaniandavar Koil on Perambur-Madhavaram Road around 9pm.

“Before I could react, the robber pushed me aside leaving me with a cut on the neck. I looked at my son and saw panic in his eyes. I wanted to be brave and set off my scooter,” Nandhini told TOI.

Fortune too favoured her as Allauddin in his attempt to escape slammed into an elderly man at the crowded Vellaiyan market and fell to the ground. Before he could get up, Nandhini arrived. Holding him by the collar, the woman screamed at others in the area to come to her help, witnesses later told police.

When a crowd gathered around the spot, the nabbed assailant denied any wrong doing and said the woman had mistaken him for another person and caught him. A search of his person found nothing. But, Nandhini, a resident of Madura Street, wouldn’t let go of him, sure that she she hadn’t made any mistake.

A team of the Sembium police arrived and took the suspect to the station. Nandhini and her son went too. At the station, when crime wing sub-inspector Vijayakumar questioned him, the man insisted that it was a case of mistaken identity. But, police scanned CCTV camera footage from the scene of crime near Palaniandavar Koil and found he was the culprit.

Inquiries revealed that Allauddin had been involved in series of robbery incidents in north Chennai over the past two and-a-half months. The bike on which he was caught belonged to a friend who is a resident of Thiru Vi Ka Nagar. He often borrowed the bike to commit robberies, the officer said.

While police commended her for her bravery, Nandhini said, “My husband Deepakraj, a software engineer, returned from work and asked me how I managed to nab the robber.”

There are two such schools in Ghatlodia, three in Bodakdev, two each in Memnagar and Thaltej and one in Vejalpur. Earlier, these schools were in AUDA limits and after the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) limits expanded in 2006, they came under the civic body’s jurisdiction.

According to an AMC circular of the estate department dated 11 September, 2015, each of these schools are to pay 0.5% of the jantri rate for the area as annual rent along with the relevant municipal taxes. “We noticed that certain schools pay the tax for the buildings on their campus but not for the playground. We reported this to the chairman of the tax committee,” said a senior property tax department official.

In all, 14 schools in the western parts have been allotted land by AUDA more than a decade ago — some of them on 90-year leases — for a token fee. The apex planning authority wanted playgrounds to be open to the public during non-school hours. In the coming two weeks, Auda will ensure boards announcing public-use hours are displayed at these spaces and a number is displayed for lodging complaints.

The app has just a little over a thousand downloads and while many motorists use smart parking spaces, majority of them use the on-site facility to book a parking space for their vehicle rather than using the app dedicated for it.

To encourage its use, officials have been informing people who come to park their vehicles at smart parking spaces. The Facebook page of Doon smart parking is also being used to spread awareness regarding the app.

According to civic officials, smart parking spaces have facilitated over 3 lakh vehicles till date. They say that booking space in advance through the app cuts last minute hassle. MDDA vice-chairman Ashish Srivastava told TOI, “Encouraging app-based parking is certainly our focus. Our aim is to reduce manpower at such facilities. Once the Integrated Command Control Centre under Smart City project becomes fully operational, parking spaces will be available only through online modes.”There are around 14 smart parking spots at Rajpur Road. In total, they have more than 461 ECS (equivalent car space). Also, the six parking spots at ISBT have around 130 slots (for both two-wheelers and four wheelers).

The biggest advantage of such facilities is that parking slots that were earlier used once or twice in a day can now be used at least eight times in a day, say officials.

To recall, MDDA, DMC, and BRIDCUL had inked a MoU for the launch of the smart parking facility. “We monitor each and every detail related to the parking facility. We also take suggestions from people regarding the facility through our Facebook page. Feedback forms of vehicles owners who use the facility are also uploaded on the page,” said Jagmohan Singh, urban and transport planning expert at MDDA.

According to officials, the smart parking facilities have generated revenue of over Rs 65 lakh between January 2019 and February 2020. The officials also said that the revenue generated from the parking is used for strengthening traffic-related infrastructure like installing and maintenance of red lights.

He also said that 10,000 postgraduate (PG) medical seats will be added across the country soon.

Heaping praise on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his achievements, Shah who was the chief guest at convocation ceremony of AIIMS-Rishikesh on Saturday, said, “About 157 medical colleges and 16 new AIIMS opened in the past six years under the aegis of PM Modi.

Shah stated that the Centre is trying to build a web of medical facilities for the people along with infrastructure for young doctors to utilize their skills. He mentioned the Centre’s ambitious plan to build at least 22 more AIIMS in the country. “We will have at least one AIIMS in each state and 22 more AIIMS in all. India will soon have the highest number of doctors, not just graduates or engineers,” he said, adding the Centre’s plans to have a medical college in every third Lok Sabha constituency by 2024, to ensure that health facility reaches the country’s remotest area.

Moreover, Shah praised the efforts of AIIMS-Rishikesh team for its progress. He also laid foundation of various facilities for eye, heart and cancer care, along with hostel for women and staff quarters.

Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, who was also present, said, “The medicos of present age have advantage over those who started three decades ago. We are constantly trying to create a platform for the medicos where they have to simply join the services and start helping the citizens. Also, AIIMS across India was former PM Vajpayee’s vision.”

Besides, Shah and Harsh Vardhan, the ceremony was attended by HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, Uttarakhand CM Trivendra Singh Rawat and AIIMS-R director Ravi Kant along with other senior officials.

243,['15/03/2020'],More burial urns unearthed in Konthagai,"Madurai: The excavation at Konthagai near Keeladi at Thirupuvanam in Sivaganga district continues to strengthen the theory that it was the burial site of the Keeladi civilization as eight burial urns have been found in a single trench by archaeologists.

The state archaeology department has initiated excavation in Konthagai, Agaram and Manalur besides Keeladi. Works had begun at Keeladi and Konthagai soon after chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami inaugurated the sixth phase of excavation on February 19. With archaeologists digging to a depth of about 4 feet in the past three weeks, interesting findings have started to emerge. Burial urns are being found at many places in Konthagai. The top portions of eight burial urns have surfaced in a cluster in one pit at Konthagai. Broken pieces of pottery and a cone-shaped lid-like pottery has also been discovered. Two trenches have been dug at this spot till date.

As ancient urns may be fragile, archaeologists are taking steps to ensure that they do not get damaged and erecting roof-like structures above the sites to protect them from direct sunlight. The smaller pots found near the urns seem to have a more sturdier and thicker mouth portion for better grip.

Keeladi also continues to bring out interesting facts like a wall of bricks, first revealed during the second phase of excavation conducted by Archaeological Survey of India. A similar structure was found by the state archaeology department in the fifth phase and the continuation of this structure is being revealed now.

While brick structures in Keeladi were found many feet apart, Konthagai seems to bring out many urns in a smaller area. Archaeologists say it would be interesting when the entire two acre area is excavated. Ground breaking ceremony for the excavation at Agaram village was conducted two days ago while Manalur is to be taken up for excavation soon.

AHMEDABAD: Residential societies registered under the Gujarat Co-Operative Societies Act, 1962 and wanting to go in for redevelopment can now apply before the registrar of co-operatives at Paldi, according to a December 26, 2019 notification of the urban development department.

There are 6,714 housing societies in Ahmedabad registered under the GCS Act, 1962 and for the last three months many of these expressed inability to apply for ‘redevelopment’ of their old buildings as a simultaneous notification was not made as per the GCS Act, 1962 giving authority to the registrar of co-operatives in each district to approve redevelopment applications of housing co-operatives.

Now the state urban development department clarified that Section 19 (1) and (2) of the Gujarat Ownership of Flats (Amendment) Rules 2019, is also applicable to housing co-operatives. The section clearly says, “The managing committee or the body of a co-operative society or association by whatever name called which is managing the affairs of the building, either suo moto or on an application received from one-fourth members of the flats or the apartments, as the case may be , with regard to undertaking the re-development of the building for the reasons as provided in sections…”

A senior official of the state agriculture and co-operation department said that since the amendment was made to the Gujarat Ownership of Flats Rules, 1974, which comes under the state urban development department, the registrar of co-operatives in many districts including Ahmedabad had been refusing redevelopment to co-operative housing societies who were applying for it. “In the coming days a new notification from the co-operatives department will allow apartments registered under the GCS Act to apply for redevelopment,” said the official.

The new amendment requires that the managing committee convene a special general meeting of the co-operative society or association within a period of one-month from the date of the ‘intent for redevelopment’ application is made before the registrar to take decision on redevelopment of the building.

The elevated portions on the PCMC-Swargate and Vanaz-Ramwadi lines will intersect with railway lines at Sangam Bridge and Khadki, respectively.

The intersections would be overhead, MahaMetro said, adding that the challenge would be to ensure adequate clearance between the railway tracks’ overhead electrical cables and the Metro rail’s viaduct.

An official said they have now approached the railway authorities to finalize technical details. “The work will also have to be done quickly. We will try our best to avoid rail blocks. We have approached Central Railway and submitted a plan to the department concerned,” the official said.

One hurdle out of the way was the height, officials said — the viaduct is being laid on pillars ranging from 18 to 22 metres in height. “We will maintain a similar height to ensure uniformity,” an official said.

The locations of both the crossings have been finalized. The PCMC-Swargate line will cross the railway tracks after the Khadki railway station before entering the Range Hills area. On the Vanaz-Ramwadi route, the Metro will cross the tracks near Sangam bridge, travelling towards the Regional Transport Office.

MahaMetro will be executing the construction work, while the railway officials will oversee the work issue necessary sanctions.

However, most farmers have little awareness and also means to measure soil health parametres, and thus often face crop failure. Bringing a technological solution to this problem, Ahmedabad-based startup, NeerX, developed a low-cost handheld device, Shool (Smart Sensor for Hydrology and Land Application), which helps measure soil health parametres such as moisture, salinity, dielectric permittivity, among others.Past journeyA BTech in Electronics and Communications from NIT Kharagpur, Nikita Tiwari, co-founded, NeerX, along with Harsh Agrawal, a BTech with Electrical Engineering from Nirma University. “Harsh and I worked on a project on farmers at a summer school programme in IIM Ahmedabad, in 2017. We learned that information about soil health is not available to farmers, due to which many face crop failure. That is when NeerX was incorporated and we began research on a low-cost, handheld device which will help measure soil health parametres,” said Tiwari.“We presented the project idea to ISRO scientists, who further helped use the right sensors to allow the device simultaneously measure crucial soil health parameters. Low power consumption and proven accuracy of the device makes it ideal for monitoring and automation,” Tiwari further added.Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and Indian Agriculture Research Institute, Delhi (IARI) validated the product which is currently assembled at the company’s facility within Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India (EDII), where the startup is currently incubated.

Our target is to install Shool stations in each district of Gujarat. We are currently working with farmers for the same,” said Tiwari.ChallengesAwareness is poor among farmers and therefore, acceptance of a new technology comes with a lot of reluctance, said Tiwari. “Convincing farmers to use the product is the toughest part so far but we’re explaining to them the benefits of using this,” she said.Secret to successCommitment to the idea coupled with the support from ISRO has helped the startup, grow according to Tiwari. “The technology support from ISRO made the product multi-functional and made it important from the utility point of view for the farmers,” she said.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/on-a-mission-to-empower-farmers/articleshow/74632579.cms

With employees flocking to the homoeopathy ward of the hospital on Ponmalai railway workshop (GOC) premises, the medicine ran out of stock in no time prompting the railways to disown its circular in this regard.

The circular was issued from the personnel branch of GOC on Friday informing railway employees that “Coronavirus preventive medicine is available in our Homeopathy Clinic in GOC. All the employees are requested to avail the facility and prevent the Coronavirus attack”. It mentioned the room at the homeo clinic where it is available and the timing when it would remain open.

As soon as the circular was displayed, several employees, particularly of group C and D, trooped to the clinic to get the medicine on Friday. However, on Saturday, the doors were closed around 11.30 am itself as the medicine ran out of stock. When asked whether homeopathy medicine would prevent coronavirus attack, medical officer (Homeopathy) of railway hospital Dr R Maragatham told TOI that they were distributing medicine to employees coming with symptoms of common respiratory diseases. “Homeopathy complex medicine is used as an immune modulator. The medicine would first stimulate the immune system and curing any particular disease is the next stage. So, we are giving such drugs to employees who wish to have them”, she added. However, on sensing the gravity of the matter, the railway authorities quickly issued a clarification.

It said it had come to notice that some letter was in circulation claiming the availability of “Corona virus preventive medicine” at the homeopathy clinic of the railway hospital. “In this regard, it is clarified that the message/letter is misleading and incorrect. Such claims have no veracity,” the clarification added.

With this observation, the Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum, Ahmedabad (Rural) has ordered city-based coaching class — Bhanwar Rathore Design Studio — to refund the fee amount of Rs 38,000 with 8% interest to a student and pay Rs 5,000 extra towards compensation for mental harassment and legal expenditure.

In this case, Navrangpura’s Kinnar Choksi sought refund of fee from the coaching class after his son left a training course for the National Aptitude Test in Architecture (NATA) after attending it for 3-4 days in 2017. He did not find the course satisfactory and sought return of fees. It was alleged that the studio lured the student by placing photographs of successful students and through its advertisements.

Upon the notice issued by the consumer forum, the coaching class said that the fee was non-refundable, and it was mentioned on the fee receipt also. The coaching class said that the claims made by Choksi were not true. It argued that students’ photographs are placed in the studio to inspire other students and not to attract them to pursue the course. Moreover, the student quit the course midway without valid reason.

After hearing the case, the forum said that fee cannot be refunded without valid reason after joining the course. But the complainant’s son clearly stated that the course was not being run properly and he did not find it satisfactory. Hence, his demand for refund of fee is reasonable.

On contention of the studio that the fee receipt mentioned that fee was non-refundable, the forum said, “Mere mention of non-refundable on receipt cannot be a base for not returning the fee. Keeping such unreasonable and one-sided condition on fee receipt itself is part of unfair trade practice.”

Preliminary work on building two stations on this stretch and the segment launcher will be launched to complete the viaduct work. MahaMetro officials said they were hoping to complete the viaduct before the monsoon.

The Metro will enter the riverbed after the two-wheeler bridge near Garware College. It will travel up to the Congress Bhavan along the river and will come out on the road which travels towards PMC’s building.

“The riverbed is a crucial stretch though it is not part of the priority section. We have started with preliminary works of the viaduct and two stations that are located on this stretch, including Deccan Gymkhana and Sambhaji Garden. We are not sure the work will get over before the monsoon, but the plan is to go all out. We are hopeful,” officials said.

Metro work in the riverbed may slow down during monsoon if water is released from upstream dams into the river.

Sources said the task of deployment of machinery in the riverbed and removing it is a huge task and MahaMetro will want to complete the work before the monsoon.

The ongoing civil work in the priority section from Vanaz to Garware College is expected to get over soon after which the manpower will be diverted to the riverbed section.

When all the tigers had vanished from Panna in 2009, one tigress from Bandhavgarh National Park – coded T1 -and another from Kanha National Park (T2) were translocated to Panna. Coded T3- the male tiger was brought from Pench tiger reserve. P234 was a part of the third litter of T2 and three new cubs are also the third litter of P234, informed the park officials. “With the new arrivals, the number of big cats in the park has gone over 55,” said the officials.

Park director KS Bhadoria said, “The field staff monitoring the movement of the tigers in the reserve spotted the cubs on Friday when the mother accompanied by the cubs were seen taking a stroll. “They were also seen sitting atop a pile of pebbles in the jungle,” said one of the field staff members who clicked the pictures of the mother with her cubs.

Last year, two cubs were born to two tigresses - coded P-151 and 142. Experiment of the reintroduction of tigers in Panna national park is considered to be quite successful.

The moves are in anticipation of a statewide lockdown or a potential outbreak of Covid-19 in the state.Reports state that the risk of coronavirus fatalities is higher among those with pre-existing ailments and senior citizens, and it is this section of the population that is beginning to dip into their savings, bankers said. India has seen two deaths due to Covid-19, one a 76-year-old man from Karnataka and the second a 68-year old woman from Delhi.“Over the last two days, we have noticed that people are withdrawing a lot of money. An NRI customer, an old man, withdrew Rs 1 lakh from his savings account,” a employee of a public sector bank in Mapusa, said.On an average, businessmen tend to withdraw funds while most citizens either deposit funds or withdraw just enough for a week. But over the past few days, banks in some parts of the state have seen at least 10-15 people withdrawing significant sums of money from their savings accounts, sometimes anywhere between Rs 70,000 to Rs 1 lakh.“A staffer asked them why they are suddenly withdrawing their money and they said that they are making arrangements to purchase provisions in case the government says they cannot leave their homes like it happened in Italy,” said a cashier working at a private bank in the state capital.Senior citizens are stocking up on groceries, medication and disinfectant products. Items such as tinned food, hand sanitisers and cleaning supplies have seen a spurt in sales, but apart from hand sanitisers, supermarkets remain well-stocked.“People have started panic-buying since late Friday night.

259,['15/03/2020'],US woman seeks CB-CID probe into brother’s death,"Chennai: Raising suspicion over the death of a 73-year-old American national who has been living in Tiruvannamalai since 2010, embracing Hinduism, his sister has approached the Madras high court.

Catherine Jean Roberts has alleged that her brother was duped of nearly Rs 20 lakh in the guise of getting permanent visa to stay in India and when he demanded the money back he was killed by fraudsters.

She wanted the high court to transfer the probe to CB-CID or any other independent agency.

Admitting the plea, Justice G K Ilanthiraiyan directed the inspector of Baluchetty Chatram police station to file a status report of the investigation and issued a further direction to the Kancheepuram superintendent of police to monitor the probe.

According to the petitioner, she along with her brother John Woodrow Roberts came to Tiruvannamalai inspired by Hindu philosophy and to embrace the religion in 2010. Since then the duo had been staying in the temple town.

Meanwhile, her brother became acquainted with S J Vignesh, who was working as a sales officer in a non-banking institution in Tiruvannamalai. Since Vignesh promised that he would arrange a permanent visa for John, he paid around Rs 20 lakh to Vignesh.

However, without making any arrangements to process the visa as promised, Vignesh fled to Dubai. Realising that he had been cheated, John hired a lawyer to get back the money from Vignesh.

On June 19, 2019 Vignesh returned to India and promised to give back the money. Within days, Vignesh telephoned John and asked him to come to Chennai to get the money. Once John reached Chennai, Vignesh took him to a secluded place and strangulated him to death.

Though, post mortem examination report opined that John had been attacked before his murder that too by more than one person, the local police investigating the murder closed the case without waiting for the report from forensic science laboratory, the petitioner alleged. Now, claiming that the petitioner has lost faith on the local police, her counsel Kanagaraj wanted the court to transfer the investigation to CB-CID or to any other independent agency and monitor the probe.

Bhopal: Almost a month-and-a-half after the first case of COVID-19 was reported from Wuhan in China, Madhya Pradesh health department officials claimed that they were prepared for the ‘worst-case scenario’.

At a press conference here on Saturday, MP health department principal secretary, Pallavi Jain Govil, said health training establishments have been converted into makeshift COVID-19 isolation centres.

According to experts, the health department’s main challenge is not just isolation of patients with symptoms of COVID-19, but also protecting its staff from cross-infection.

Increase in the number of human to human transmission without any travel history to the epicentre region in China has been reported in Italy and the US.

The health department has a limited number of personal protective equipment (PPE), about 37,000 respiratory masks and only 104 ventilators.

“We are screening people on entry at airports and selected locations. However, health department has limited staff. We request anyone with symptoms to get themselves tested at the nearest health centre for free,” said Govil.

NPA and other allowances of health workers for this period is being considered, she added.

261,['15/03/2020'],Docs: Blood test best alternative to breathalyzer test,"Madurai: In the wake of Madurai police temporarily suspending breathalyzer tests for checking drunken driving, doctors said that blood test is a more effective and accurate alternative for checking blood alcohol content (BAC).

On Friday, Madurai city police commissioner S Davidson Devasirvatham directed officials to suspend using breathalyzers in the background of the Covid-19 scare, since the infection primarily spreads through air.

“Police can easily identify drunken people by noticing symptoms such as altered smell, sensorium, imbalance and aggressiveness. Then, they can bring the person to a hospital for blood test. Blood and urine tests are the most common alternatives for breathalyzer test although saliva and hair tests can also be done,” said Dr L Muthukumaran, a physician.

In the country, the permissible BAC is set at 0.03% per 100ml blood. Breathalyzers usually measure the alcohol content that is expelled from the lungs on a person’s breath.

“Breathalyzers provide instant results, which is why it is preferred by police. But, blood tests or urine tests are safer and done in a controlled hospital environment,” said the physician.

He said that while urine is easy to test, its accuracy may be questionable compared to a blood or breath test.

“Urine tests can detect alcohol between 12 hours and 24 hours. However, a urine specimen cannot accurately specify how much alcohol was consumed. But, blood test allows direct testing of the alcohol content in blood and hence has the highest accuracy compared to even breathalyzer tests,” said Dr Muthukumaran.

Blood tests, in general practice, are already sometimes done additionally to breathalyzer tests in some drunken-driving cases.

Even if breathalyzers are reintroduced, blood tests can still be preferred because of its higher accuracy, especially with the recent order by Madras high court, which had directed to arrest drunken drivers and cancel their driving licences.

262,['15/03/2020'],Residents’ up in arms against misuse of Puzhuthivakkam lake,"Chennai: Residents of Madipakkam and Puzhuthivakkam have raised concerns as miscreants are using the restored Puzhuthivakkam lake as an open-air bar and dumping liquor bottles into the water body and along the newly laid footpath. Residents urge the civic body to expedite fencing along the lake to prevent such activities.

The civic body has already missed the deadline to complete the restoration by a year.

“The project which began in November 2018 was to be completed in three months. But, as of now only the footpath has been laid and still patch work remains in some areas,” said Veera Raghavan, a resident of Sheela Nagar.

However, work which was progressing at a snail’s pace until now suddenly picked up pace a week ago. Workers started installing stairs and hand rails along the lake bund. The urgency became obvious on Friday when residents learnt that a portion of the bund was spruced up for Governor Banwarilal Purohit’s visit to a religious event nearby.

“Even on Saturday morning, there were several bottles of liquor along the bund. Since, the footpath has come into use, elderly people and children have started using the space,” said M Patel, a resident of Otteri Salai in Puzhuthivakkam.

Residents say it is high time the authorities expedite the fencing process and put up high-mast lights to prevent antisocial activities.

The Chennai corporation had earmarked Rs 2.4 crore from the smart city project fund for the restoration of the lake and proposed to set up a walking track, fences, benches and create islands. They also planned to plant trees on the islands and grass on the bund.

A corporation official said that time was consumed in reclaiming the encroached spaces surrounding the waterbody and hence the delay in complete restoration of the waterbody.

Another issue residents’ flagged off is motorcycles using the footpath to reach Puzhuthivakkam from Madipakkam Main Road. “It is posing risk for walkers and the corporation should consider erecting bollards along the footpath,” a resident said.

CHENNAI: The city corporation has run into a road block in its efforts to prepare a base map of properties and utilities in the added areas using GIS. The selected contractor during a sample door-to-door survey in zone 2 (Manali) and zone 15 (Sholinganallur) has found that many street names and door numbers do not match the field data.

The survey is being carried out to help Greater Chennai Corporation get the exact number of properties in the city based on which the tax collection, the main source of revenue for the civic body, can be completed properly.

Internal documents of the civic body show that the private company which has been tasked with conducting the exercise was able to finish it without any problem in 106 wards in the core city area. It was when its staff began the project in the added areas that they found it difficult at they found they couldn’t tally the corporation’s MIS (management information system) data with that collected from the field. “Many vacant properties could not be tallied as street names were not present. This is a big challenge for the civic body which has to be rectified in the near future,” senior officials said.

In several places, the documents show, even signboards were not present. These are issues that have been highlighted by residents of the added areas through complaints in person and online for a while now, saying they found it difficult to get routine matters like delivery of milk and newspapers among others fixed.

In zone 2, the contractor found a lot of vacant properties, but owners of adjacent properties knew very little about the properties. Tax assessment bills and address in the MIS records did not match the actual location of the property. In zone 11, some properties did not have access roads.

The citizen consumer and civic action group had also noted in an exercise conducted in October last year in the Ambattur zone about how there were many discrepancies; for instance, some roads present in maps were not present on the field and vice-versa. Also some other roads were known by a different name on the field, the group said in a blog post detailing the survey.

While regular classes across educational institutions in Goa have been suspended from March 16-31, examinations, including the ongoing Class XII test, will continue as scheduled. Officials of the Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, however, said there were presently no plans to disinfect exam halls. “The directorate of education has already issued instructions on precautions to be taken by all students,” an official said.

Teachers who are engaged as conductors, invigilators and paper correctors by the Goa Board were upset that no protective gear like masks and disinfectants were being provided to them during the Class XII board examination.

“In Goa, we have students from all over. We do not know their travel history or who they have come in contact with,” one teacher said.

Directives from the state’s education department regarding suspension of regular classes also caused confusion among teachers and other staff, who were unsure if they were required to report to schools . A subsequent clarification issued by the directorate of higher education stated that teachers and administrative staff would have to attend to their duties.

Teachers also said that, in effect, the closure of regular classes did not apply to them as most state institutions presently have their exams going on, for which they would have to be present. They also said that they would later be required for other academic work such as correction of internal examination papers and preparation of the final results of students.

“In the 60 schools run by the Diocesan Society of Education , exams will be held simultaneously from around March 23-30. The directives apply only up to March 31. It means we will get relief only for a few days. We will have to attend school during the rest of the days, first to conduct the exams and later to attend to academic work, which is to prepare the results,” a teacher from Panaji said.

Some private schools like Sharda Mandir in Miramar had already decided to suspend classes before the government’s announcement.

PATNA: The state government has come up with an alternate duty plan for Group C and D staff—two of the largest groups of employees—in all its offices to avoid mass gathering as a precautionary measure against the global Covid-19 outbreak.

The order issued late on Friday stipulates the presence of only 50% employees in office on alternate work day basis, which draws on the principle that lesser the number of people, lesser the chances of infection spreading via physical contact.

“Adhering to the general advisory regarding Covid-19 to prevent mass gathering, the general administration department issued an order on Friday evening regarding alternate duty of Class C and D workers of the state government. All department heads, except health department, have been issued instructions to form rosters for this purpose and execute the practice on immediate basis,” chief secretary Deepak Kumar told TOI on Saturday.

The chief secretary added, “Officials will continue to report as usual and deliberations on any restriction for workplaces of private firms and commercial places will be held in a meeting slated to be held on Monday under the chairmanship of chief minister Nitish Kumar.”

Apart from this innovative step, the state government has suspended all passenger movement through the integrated check post on the India-Nepal border at Raxaul in East Champaran from Saturday midnight. Only exception is outward movement of Nepalese and Bhutanese national.

A formal office memorandum in this regard was issued by the immigration section of foreigners division of ministry of home affairs on Friday. The order states that there will be intensified health inspections at all entry points and any traveller whether Indian or Nepalese or Bhutanese or any other country showing history of travel to Covid-19 outbreak countries namely Italy, China, Spain, France, Germany and Republic or Korea shall be subjected to quarantine in the appropriate facility of state or central government.

Kumar Pankaj, incharge of immigration at Raxaul said the last foreign national allowed to cross the border was a Russian, who was allowed to enter India around 6pm on Friday after thorough screening for Covid-19.

Adhering to restriction on passenger movement on the India-Nepal border, Bihar State Road Transport Corporation has also suspended the operation of its six air-conditioned buses from Patna and Gaya to Janakpur and Kathmandu in Nepal from Sunday ill March 31.

“We will also thoroughly sanitise all inter-district and inter-city buses being run by BSRTC to prevent spread of Covid-19 as per the government advisory,” said Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, secretary, transport department.

Health department officials claimed that over 1.42 lakh passengers have been screened at transit points in the state to date. Altogether 19,105 people have been screened at Patna and Gaya airports for symptoms of Covid-19. State officials also said as many as 274 passengers, who have returned from Covid-19-affected countries since January 15, have been kept in home isolation, out of which 84 people have completed their 14-day quarantine.

Speaking at a press meet organized on Saturday, district collector Dr T G Vinay said that the recruitment rally is a great opportunity for youngsters, who cleared Class X and XII, to get jobs with the IAF. “Men in the age group 17-21, who have scored more than 50% in their Class X and XII, are eligible for recruitment. This is a part of efforts by IAF to ensure more representation from Tamil Nadu,” he said. The recruitment rally will be held at Dr MGR Stadium.

The collector added that training will also be conducted before the rally to prepare candidates for the recruitment. “We found that in Tamil Nadu, there is a lack of awareness about job opportunities at IAF. So, first, we want to train the candidates, who are interested for recruitment. Undergoing the training definitely can increase their chances of getting the job,” said IAF group captain Sriram.

The recruitment process involves a physical fitness test, written exam testing their English, general awareness and reasoning, adaptability test and a group discussion. Candidates, who can clear all stages, will then be eligible to go for a medical appointment and subsequently join as recruits. For more information regarding IAF recruitment, interested candidates can check the website www.airmenselection.cdac.in.

TRICHY: The public health department and preventive medicine and the Trichy district administration have advised the public to wash their hands with soap, instead of sanitizers.

“Branded sanitizers may be out of stock. In fact, there is no compulsion to use only sanitizers. Yet, we have been making sanitizers and supplying them to health centres. Soaps alone are enough to wash the hands if we follow the hand washing techniques,” Trichy district collector S Sivarasu told reporters after addressing an awareness meeting on Covid-19 here on Saturday. The meeting was attended by representatives from hospitals, theatres, marriage halls, schools and other businesses.

On the necessity for mass awareness programme, the collector said, “Rumours about Covid-19 are rife on social media, so, we are supposed to drive home the right message to the people. In the first phase, business people have been sensitized on the preventive measures. Since the source of spreading the virus is hand, we have asked them to make their places virus free.”

School administrations have been asked to create awareness on Covid-19 during the prayer every morning. They have also been told to keep the vans carrying children disinfected by spraying disinfectant. The collector also csaid that there was no need to declare holiday for schools in Trichy.

On the cleanliness in theatres, the collector warned of action if the guidelines on preventive measures were skipped. Theatres have been asked to clean the halls with disinfectants once the show is over. “A nodal officer from the public health department will monitor their measures and will be subjected to action in case of lack of compliance,” collector said.

Endorsing a similar view on the use of sanitizers, deputy director of health services (DDHS), Trichy Dr A Subramani said the basic concept is that everyone should follow hand wash either with soap or sanitizer.

He also said, “All cases are imported from other states due to the travel history to other countries. So far, there is no community spread. The virus spreads through droplets.”

Officials also confirmed that the need for wearing mask was restricted to infected people and those in contact with them.

HYDERABAD: Enforcement Directorate ( ED ) sleuths have conducted searches on the properties of Syed Akhtar, owner of SA Builders and Developers, in connection with the Heera Gold fraud case.

ED sources said SA Builders allegedly received over Rs 50 crore from the accounts of Heera Gold case prime accused Nowhera Sheikh. The searches, which started on Friday afternoon and ended in the wee hours of Saturday, were conducted in the case of money laundering booked against the Heera case accused. The ED said Akhtar was not cooperating with the investigation agency.

ED sleuths might conduct more searches on the properties of other accused in the Heera Gold cases. The agency had already attached Rs 300 crore properties of Heera Group and has been probing how the money was sent out.

Income-tax sleuths in October, 2017, conducted searches on the properties of Akhtar and found that the company had tax exposure of Rs 56 crore worth transactions with Heera Gold. The search then was conducted after a survey on Heera Gold properties.

Interestingly, Akhtar had then revealed to I-T sleuths that he was abducted by renegade naxal Nayeemuddin and he was forced to pay a ransom of Rs 5 crore. Nayeem had reportedly abducted him in connection with a land dispute at Seven Tombs area. The ransom was reportedly paid hours before the encounter of Nayeem in August, 2016.

Central Crime Station investigation found that Heera scamsters had collected around Rs 5,647 crores of deposits in the name of a gold scheme. Twenty-two criminal cases were booked against the accused as victims were spread over several states as well as in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. ED alleged over 1.72 lakh investors were duped and the accused floated several shell companies.

PANAJI/VASCO: The state’s Kadamba Transport Corporation Ltd (KTC) started sanitising its buses and bus terminuses on Saturday as a precaution against Covid-19. Three bus stands and at least 100 buses have been sanitised so far, KTC officials said.

“We started sanitisation work on three major bus terminuses — Panaji, Vasco and Margao — from 6am. Other bus stands will soon follow, and the exercise will be carried out regularly from now on,” a KTC official told TOI.

At each bus stand, disinfectant was sprayed by a team of 10-15 people that comprised KTC conductors and staff. After sanitising the stand, the team undertook the work of disinfecting interstate buses, followed by intrastate buses.

There are a total of 14 bus depots from where KTC operates. These include Canacona, Sakhali, Ponda, Honda, Cuncolim, Mapusa, Valpoi, Shiroda, Assonora, Bicholim and Pernem, besides the three that have been sanitised. KTC has a fleet of over 500 buses, a majority of which operate on intrastate routes.

As per the KTC directive, every conductor on duty will clean every part of the bus with disinfectant water at the end of the day.

The Union ministry of road transport and highways recently advised the relevant authorities to undertake all requisite steps to sanitise public transport vehicles. Alhough the state directorate of transport has followed the directives, it has little or no information on how to go about the disinfection process, like what chemical to use, a transport official said.

“We would encourage people to carry their own sanitisers, wear face masks while commuting, and as much as possible, use their own transport instead of public transport till the situation improves,” the official said.

KTC chairman and Vasco MLA Carlos Alemida, who was present at the port town’s KTC terminus during the sanitisation drive on Saturday, said health awareness posters have been put up at the Panaji bus stand in accordance with the Centre’s advisory, while similar talks have been held at the Margao and Porvorim depots. “Announcement will be made at bus stands to educate people. Biometrics have been kept in abeyance till March 31,” he said.

My friend is under observation at Ward 27 Kasturba Hospital Mumbai with 10 other patients. These bad conditions with poor sanitation, reckless staff attitude will not help contain the pandemic.” He posted four pictures of filthy wash basins, functional mattresses on rusting beds and stray animals roaming.A Mira Road resident, who is worried about her sister returning from Europe, currently the epicentre of the Covid-19 pandemic, said, “She won’t be able to survive in a place like Kasturba Hospital. Can’t more private facilities be opened for quarantine?” Another said these quarantine facilities give out a “jail-like” feeling.The city’s primary quarantine facility inside Kasturba at Chinchpokli wears the look of a typical public hospital. While Ward 30, housed in a standalone building at one end of the hospital premises, previously had 28 beds, over 30 more have been added hastily in adjoining wards following the coronavirus outbreak. Commenting on Gupta’s tweet, BMC’s Dr Daksha Shah said they have instructed the housekeeping staff to look into it. “We are probing the matter,” she said.A doctor from Chembur said, “When we suspect people could have Covid-19 and recommend that they go to Kasturba Hospital for tests to rule out the virus, they say they would rather stay at home in isolation for weeks.” Echoing the sentiment, infectious diseases expert Dr Tanu Singhal said at this stage, the virus is circulating among the affluent who have travelled abroad. “They are sceptical about visiting Kasturba Hospital and many wouldn’t even reach there. They are worried they may catch another infection,” she said.On Friday, four Covid-19 “suspects” escaped quarantine from a government facility in Nagpur. Earlier, Indian students who were evacuated from Wuhan by an Air-India flight and kept in army quarantine camps in Haryana, too, spoke about poor and inadequate arrangements for a 14-day stay. One of the persons told TOI then that the facilities at the camp were much worse than the quarantine she had come from. “It is just the feeling that I am in my home country that keeps me going,’’ she said.In 2002-03, when the SARS epidemic was on, too, people put under quarantine in Kasturba had a litany of complaints about the condition in the hospital. While public hospitals that run on tight budgets cannot be expected to have sparkling floors and walls, in Mumbai many don’t even have a functional toilet. While the health department talks of the merits of frequent handwash and sanitizers, most public hospitals don’t have these.“But do they at least have adequate infrastructure to treat a seriously ill patient?” asked the Mira Road resident. The Kasturba isolation facility has four invasive and four non-invasive ventilators.On Saturday, BMC chief Pravin Pardeshi conducted a video-conference with senior ward officials to check their preparedness. Civic officials stated it is patients from poor backgrounds who usually visit civic-run hospitals, including Kasturba. But since Covid-19, the suspected patients at Kasturba are mostly foreign returned. The BMC is trying to improve the facilities at the hospital to match private hospitals. It has hired a private agency to improve the hospital’s cleanliness with hourly sweeping.Pardeshi said, “We are revamping facilities at the hospital. It is mentally stressful to be alone in quarantine, so we are providing TV and magazines to patients to make them feel better. Two private hospitals are also helping us manage the quarantine facilities at Seven Hills Hospital (which has been opened up for quarantine).” The BMC has alerted hospital security to ensure no quarantined patient can escape.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74633250,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-122203,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/quarantine-wards-at-kasturba-filthy-strays-roam-around/articleshow/74632034.cms

The Act regulates production, supply and distribution of the essential commodities so that they are available to consumers at fair prices. The move came after the government’s previous directive to traders warning them against hoarding and overpricing of these items was not paid heed to.Commissioner of Maharashtra Food and Drugs Administration Arun Unhale admitted that there was a shortage of hand sanitizers and masks and said that the government was aware of the crisis. “In a meeting held by state FDA minister Rajendra Shingne at the Mantralaya on Saturday, manufacturers and distributors were asked to increase production and ensure regular supply. The supply should normalise within two to three days,” said Unhale.He said that the government was appealing to people to avoid hoarding and not create panic unnecessarily so that everyone could get access to the commodities.According to Shailendra Rawat, secretary of the Aurangabad Chemists and Druggists Association, there is a shortage in the supply of smaller packs of hand sanitizers measuring 50ml and 100ml. “In Aurangabad city, 300 to 400 pieces of medical sanitizers, which are used by doctors in hospitals, are available in 500ml packs which costs around Rs 600.

SECUNDERABAD: Come summer, the residents of Marredpally and Musheerabad may face water scarcity as the groundwater table in the areas has been been plummeting rapidly since February, according to a recent report by the ground water department (GWD), Hyderabad district.

The report was formulated using piezometer measurements of groundwater levels at Government Junior College in West Marredpally, Marredpally, Gandhi hospital in Musheerabad, Sanjeevaiah Park and Hussain Sagar. According to GWD officials, the range of dip water table in these areas is between 0.24 and 1.32 meters below ground (MBG) level.

Based on GWD’s February 2019 report, the groundwater level at Marredpally was 20.87 meters this month last, as compared to 7.45 meters now. This means, the water level has observed a dip of 13.42 meters within a year.

“Due to massive construction activity, rock-sheet has been soread over the entire Marredpally area, which is the main reason for groundwater depletion. Chances of rainwater percolating intoare very less,” said an analyst from GWD.

In Musheerabad, the water level in February last year was 9.38 meters. It rests at 6.30 meters this year and has observed a fall of 3.08 meters.

A small dip has been found in Secunderabad. The groundwater was measured at 3.71 meters and is at 2.95 meters this year. A fall of 0.76 meters has been observed.

“While the groundwater depletion is not new to us, to our relief, the Centre has encouraged the construction of rain water harvesting pits in all properties, which may help in avoiding a water crisis,” DS Subhash, a resident of Marredpally told TOI.

According to Rohini, a resident of Musheerabad, the GHMC needs to stop sanctioning construction projects in the area.

The Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) has swung into action and unveiled a summer action plan. They plan to have additional water tankers and water filling points in Marredpally, Secunderabad and Musheerabad.

The accused were identified as Murugeswari, from Kamarajar Street in Bibikulam, and her friends Sunilkumar and Shahul Hameed.

The girl, studying in Class 4 in an aided school, had burnt injury marks on her foot, scars on her head and next to her eyes and was recently treated for injuries in her private part after she was hit with a broom stick. There scar on her head was caused when a bunch of her hair was forcibly pulled out while her head was tonsured to treat the injury.

Based on a complaint from her aunt R Sundaravalli, 27, from Meenambalpuram, a case was registered with the Tallakulam police station under the IPC sections 323 (voluntary causing hurt) and 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and the Juvenile Justice (care and protection of children) Act, 2015.

According to Sundaravalli’s complaint, Murugeswari divorced her husband four years back and was now in a relationship with Sunilkumar. She has been raising the child alone while working in cosmetic shop in Vishaal de Mall. When she came to know about Murugeswari’s relationship with Sunilkumar a couple of years back, she had warned her and stopped talking to her as Murugeswari threatened her and her husband Rajaguru to keep away from their life.

On Tuesday night, unable to bear the torture any longer, the girl went to Sundaravalli’s house, located around 2km away, and narrated her ordeal. Although Murugeswari came along with Sunilkumar and his friend Shahul Hameed demanding the girl, Sundaravalli refused.

Rajaguru said that the girl was not fed properly in the morning and was relying on lunch provided in the school under the noon meal scheme. Although, the girl was being tortured by the three for long, it increased in the last one month.

CHENNAI: The Centre has notified constitution of a regional bench of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal ( NCLAT ) in Chennai, a long pending demand of legal fraternity of southern states.

The appellate tribunal would have jurisdiction over Tamil Nadu , Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and the Union territories of Lakshwadeep and Puducherry.

The notification which comes into force on March 18 said the NCLAT bench in New Delhi will be known as the principal bench. “I welcome the move as hundreds of appeals from NCLTs in the five states have to go to Delhi for NCLAT hearing. Establishing a regional bench in Chennai would help reduce time and cost,” senior advocate P S Raman said. Adding that the notification is special to him since the regional bench would be constituted in Chennai, Raman said, “I hope that the Centre and the state government would get a good place for establishing the appellate tribunal with adequate infrastructure and staff. They must also make sure that the NCLAT starts functioning as soon as possible.”

“As an MP (member of parliament), I have been requesting to decongest New Delhi and de-cluster tribunals as New Delhi houses more than 43 tribunals. Only few tribunals have notified its benches in other states even though the respective act through which they’re constituted permits such regional benches,” said senior advocate and DMK MP P Wilson.

“Central government should constitute benches of tribunals where the legislation permits so that there is no need to travel to New Delhi. Such benches will serve the litigants and the lawyers and cut down the cost of litigation. Access to justice is one of fundamental rights. Our struggle to bring regional benches of Supreme Court and one at Chennai is our predominant aim,” Wilson added.

Similarly, noting that the notification is indeed a welcome move, senior advocate A R L Sundaresan said, “Finally the long pending demand of the Bar has been accepted. The regional bench in Chennai would reduce the time and cost consumed to move such appeals for both the litigants and the lawyers. Justice has been made accessible. It would be a boon to the companies registered in the states.”

Khanna cited the wedding of an Indian couple staying in Belgium scheduled to take place in Jaipur last week. It was among the bevy of destination weddings that have been cancelled as the virus put paid to the travel plans of international guests.“There is nothing we can do,” said Khanna. “We want to show clients that we are on their side.” Some hotels, too, are running on close to 25% occupancy as various conferences and social events have been cancelled, said Khanna, who knows of a suburban five-star that has shut an entire wing following cancellations. Some venues are even offering the option of rescheduling dates.As for those weddings where the show must go on, planners are feeling their way around the panic in the air. While Nimoli Laheja of A New Knot Weddings and Celebrations said they are ensuring precautions such as sanitizing floors and instructing team members to wear a mask for events, Neha Arora of Var Vadhu Weddings said the firm has started checking the temperatures of its crew, decorators and caterers, installing hand santizers, reducing “unwanted labour” on site and has even activated a “work from home” program.Dhawal Oza of Dreamz, Events N Ideas attended a low-key wedding on Thursday in which he found guests not only shaking hands with the couple but also hugging them. According to Oza, whose sister got married on February 16 and has been unable to go on a honeymoon yet, it is our gullible minds that need disinfecting. “What’s more dangerous than the virus are WhatsApp messges, which create panic and makes everyone an expert on everything.”",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74637173,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1020632,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/big-fat-desi-wedding-is-now-a-slim-sanitized-affair/articleshow/74632604.cms

And for what? Rajya Sabha and cabinet berth under Modi-Shah? Sad. Never expected this from him.”“But then, hunger of power is more important to some than credibility and ideology, the very essence of a healthy democracy,” he remarked.The senior leader admitted that he has differences with RSS-BJP combine, but admires their “unwavering commitment to the goal of a Hindu Rashtra”. “I don’t agree with Sangh/BJP at all, but admire their commitment to their ideology. How RSS waited from 1925 to the ’90s to come to power in Delhi, without wavering from their ultimate goal ‘Hindu Rashtra’. They have successfully fooled Socialists, particularly JP, and now Nitish, to achieve their ultimate goal of having an RSS pracharak as PM of India,” Digvijaya tweeted.He feels times have changed for RSS, too. “I have seen RSS activists, who devoted their whole life and left their family to work for the Sangh. But now, the new Pracharaks of RSS have changed. Narendra Modi is the most glaring example of this new breed of RSS pracharaks. I am no admirer of Narendra Modi and one of his most bitterest critics, but then admire his courage of conviction and uncompromising effort to polarize the country on every possible issue and every opportunity,” the former CM tweeted.“PM Modi does not realise what damage he is doing to the country by destroying the social fabric of the country, the very idea of India and very ethos of Sanatan Dharm and Hinduism,” Singh alleged, adding that claimed that Jyotiraditya’s grandmother and BJP founder member Vijaya Raje Scindia had asked him to join Jan Sangh, but he refused.“Rajmata Vijaya Raje Scindia, for whom I had and still have the greatest regard and respect, wanted me to join Jan Sangh in 1970 when I was president of Rajgarh Nagar Palika but I politely refused when I read ‘Bunch of Thoughts’ of Guru Golwalkar and interacted with RSS leaders,” he tweeted.The former CM pointed out that he had stayed out of power and worked for Congress from 2004 to 2014, despite the party offering him a cabinet berth and a ticket to Rajya Sabha. “But I politely declined. I could have easily come to Lok Sabha from Rajgarh, my home constituency, but I declined and got the Congress candidate to win. Why?

Subsequently, it has come to fore that the schools lacked basic infrastructure for several years.In a meeting held earlier this month, deputy divisional commissioner, Aurangabad, instructed the teaching and administrative staff of ZP schools about the measures to be taken for preventing spread of Covid -19.In the meeting, the schools were informed that necessary arrangements for hand washing must be made at schools and anganwadis. The schools were asked to ensure that sufficient water and soap or hand wash be provided to the students. Also, the schools were instructed to educate the students on the importance of washing hands regularly.Schools were also told that they could use grants for the making the resources available for students as well as staff.The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, under Section 19 enlists norms and standards a school must follow. It mandates the schools to ensure that drinking water facility and sanitation facilities, including toilets and hand washing facilities, are available at the schools. However, many ZP schools in the district lack these basic facilities, said health activist Vilas Jadgale.Jagdale, a homeopath, said that the lack of facility for washing hands is not merely related to coronavirus. “The lack of hygiene in children leads to diarrhoea and even typhoid. This further leads to reduction in immunity which makes them vulnerable to infections,” he said. Tanks that store drinking water for children in schools are also rarely cleaned and that is why they develop algae and other impurities, he added.When asked, Aurangabad ZP CEO Mangesh Gondavale agreed that hand washing facilities should be available at schools at all times. Gondavale, who took charge of his office recently, said that he will see to it that the schools have soaps/hand wash, hand washing stations and sufficient water.According to Mahesh Labde, a teacher and activist, the government has stopped sending hand wash or soaps for the last three years.

298,['15/03/2020'],"Madhya Pradesh: 10 rebel MLAs not willing to join BJP, says Scindia loyalist Rawat","Madhya Pradesh Congress working president Ramniwas Rawat

BHOPAL: Amidst the ongoing political drama in the state, a former Madhya Pradesh minister and state Congress working president Ramniwas Rawat on Saturday claimed that ten out of 22 MLAs, Scindia loyalists who submitted their resignations are not willing to join the BJP.

Rawat, who hails from Sheopur district is known to be a Jyotiraditya Scindia loyalist. Claiming to have spoken to many rebel MLAs from Chambal-Gwalior region who are lodged in a resort in Bengaluru, Rawat said, “The rebel MLAs did not have full knowledge of how things would unfold. As loyalists, they blindly followed the directives.”

“This is the reason why it cannot be believed that they resigned willingly and without pressure. BJP understands many of these MLAs will not agree to quit Congress.”

Speaking to reporters at the state Congress office here, Rawat said Scindia was “insecure” about his political career after he lost the Lok Sabha elections from Guna last year. Four-time MP, Scindia, lost the 2019 Lok Sabha polls from Guna constituency by a margin of 1.25 lakh votes.

“The doors of Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi were always open for him and they would have convinced him to stay on. But, he had already made up his mind,” he said.

Rawat was a supporter of Congress leader and Jyotiraditya’s father late Madhavrao Scindia whom he followed and joined the Madhya Pradesh Vikas Congress party which late Madhavrao Scindia founded in 1996. “I joined the MP Vikas Congress because it was a separate party and not the BJP. Later, we returned to the Congress. Madhavrao Scindia’s untimely death was unfortunate for me and the country,” Rawat said.

He clarified that though he is a Scindia loyalist he will always remain with the Congress. “My loyalties are first with the Congress party, AICC president Sonia Gandhi and leaders Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi. Though Scindia’s vacuum in the Congress will be felt, it can be filled. In 2003, 2008 and 2013 assembly elections people of Gwalior-Chambal did not vote for Congress, but in 2018 Congress won maximum seats in the region,” he said.

State Congress media department chairperson Shobha Oza argued that Jyotiraditya Scindia has been given more respect in the Congress than anyone else. “Out of 18 years in the party, he was MP for 17 years. He was made Union minister twice and member of the Congress Working Committee,” she said. “He was made in-charge of Uttar Pradesh along with Priyanka Gandhi, that was the stature he was given,” she said.

He expressed confidence that India, which is the third largest domestic civil aviation market in the world and is on way to become the third largest civil aviation market globally, is expected to bounce back in the near-term.

“There may be 15%-20% drop in domestic traffic for the time being. But I believe it is a passing phase,” the minister said while addressing participants on the third day of Wings India 2020.

Puri pointed out that the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) has been monitoring the coronavirus situation closely and has been taking all the necessary precautions to keep flyers safe.

“Information regarding coronavirus came into the public domain towards the end of December 2019. WHO pronounced it as a serious global emergency around the end of January. We started acting on it on January 17,” he said, adding that within hours of the first case coming to light, India started screening passengers flying in from the 12 most affected countries and eventually extended it to all international passengers on March 4.

The minister pointed out that 10,876 flights carrying nearly 12 lakh passengers from international destinations to Indian airports have been screened so far. Of the total 12 lakh passengers screened, 3,225 who exhibited some symptoms of the virus were sent for further screening.

“Today, our airports constitute a benchmark on how airports should be run in a situation like this globally,” he said.

Currently, India sees around 345 million passengers annually and industry expects it to cross the 1 billion mark by 2030 but the minister said he expects this milestone to be reached by 2024-25.

Meanwhile, speaking at the event, Telangana IT and industries minister KT Rama Rao urged the Union civil aviation minister to push for a GST rate cut on maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) operations as well as sharpen focus on creating skills for the sector. The MRO industry, which has been grappling with a high GST of 18%, has been urging the government to slash it to 5%.

Most of them have replied to our notices and have assured us that their schools will remain closed till March 31. If any school in Uttarakhand is found operating before March 31, then we will take strict action against them,” said Asha Rani Painuly, chief education officer.

In another related development pertaining to the coronavirus threat, restrictions on entry of foreign nationals from Uttarakhand’s Banbasa immigration point in Champawat district also came into effect on Saturday.

“After Union home ministry’s guidelines, entry of foreigners has been barred. The guidelines have been issued for all land check posts in India. Foreign nationals entering through the checkpost are being stopped and sent back to Nepal,” said Inder Singh, immigration officer, Banbasa.

“Though home ministry has barred movement of foreign nationals on the Indo-Nepal border due to coronavirus pandemic, entry and exit of buses using the Banbasa checkpoint - only for Indians and Nepalese - are exempted as of now,” added Lokeshwar Singh, SP Champawat.

Meanwhile, a Russian family who arrived at Khatima in Udham Singh Nagar district was screened by health department officials under police watch. Their preliminary tests turned out to be negative.

CHANDIGARH: Two iron manhole covers bearing an impression of a map of Chandigarh and designed by French-Swiss architect Le Corbusier were stolen in sectors 3 and 10, police said on Saturday after registering a case.

In his complaint, Angrej Singh, sub-divisional engineer, municipal corporation, said his subordinates informed him that when they reached Sector 10 to clean a sewer line, they found a heritage manhole cover missing a couple of days back. Another MC team found a manhole cover in Sector 3 was also stolen.

Police registered a case under Section 379 (theft) of IPC and are scrutinizing footage from CCTV cameras of nearby areas to zero in on the accused.

In November 2010, a Paris-based auction house had sold one such heritage manhole cover for Rs 10.67 lakh.

The city has around 2,000 iron manhole covers bearing an impression of Chandigarh map. The MC had acknowledged these manhole covers are susceptible to thefts and cases of them being sold at high prices in the international market have been reported.

Last year, the MC had decided to replace all heritage manhole covers with concrete ones and had passed an agenda worth Rs 75 lakh for the job.

On November 29, 2019, police had booked unknown persons for stealing a heritage manhole cover from near the light point of sectors 22 and 23.

On January 9, 2019, thieves had tried to steal a heritage manhole cover from Sector 36. Later, officials claimed the item was found near the spot.

305,['15/03/2020'],Birdwatchers free mongoose caught in metal snare,"Coimbatore: Nature enthusiasts were shocked to discover unchecked poaching activities near the Singanallur lake in the city on Saturday. Pointing out that they were regulars to the lake for birdwatching and photography activities, they said they were shocked to find two Indian grey mongooses (Herpestes edwardsii) trapped in snares near the lake. While one of them was alive, the other was dead and partially decomposed. They also found tools and equipment for setting up more snares near the lake.

V Chithran, a final-year law student and nature enthusiast, said they first spotted the live mongoose that was trapped in a snare. “We loosened the snare and freed the mongoose. Another snare that was set about 50ft away had a dead mongoose, the right hind leg and tail of which were missing.”

The birdwatchers subsequently inspected the entire lake surroundings and found a bag of tools and equipment such as coils of steel wire, copper wire, knives and iron rods to set up more snares. They said all mongoose species found in India were protected under the Schedule II of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Poaching of the animal may invite imprisonment up to seven years and/or a heavy fine. The animal is also covered under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, an international agreement between governments, completely banning its commercial trade across globe, they said.

G R Ramya, another nature enthusiast who was at the spot, said mongooses were usually poached for their hair, which is used to make cosmetic brushes.

In the past, forest officials had seized painting brushes that were made of mongoose hair from the city shops. District forest officer D Venkatesh said their personnel were investigating the case.

The facility under the flyover is capable of accommodating 32 cars.“We decided on the inauguration late on Friday night. Hence, even senior leaders from the neighbourhood — Subrata Mukherjee and Sovan Deb Chatterjee — could not be invited,” mayor-in-council member Debasish Kumar acknowledged at the brief inaugural function.According to sources, Kolkata Police that has set up the parking lot is yet to hand it over to KMC. Conspicuously, senior cops were absent at the function that got wrapped up in less than 10 minutes. “We will look at setting up more such facilities as parking solution in congested places,” Hakim said.Two other mechanised parking lots — at Rawdon Street and Lindsay Street — that were co-promoted by KMC are currently lying shut. The new facility at Gariahat though uses technology that is much more modern and mechanism that is easy to use.Hakim said a charging station would also be set up next to the parking facility for electric vehicles (EV). “We want to promote EVs in the city to reduce pollution and setting up more charging stations alongside parking facilities like these will encourage citizens to buy such cars,” he explained.KMC sources said the civic authority had received proposals for more such mechanised parking lots under Gariahat flyover as the area has a huge demand. Heavy rush of shoppers during festive months, including Chaitra Sale in April, makes parking at Gariahat a nightmare. With demand exceeding supply, parking attendants resort to extortion, charging two-three times higher than the official rate.A civic official said the facility was a pilot project that could be replicated across the city if it proves to be a success. At the Gariahat facility, KMC proposes to charge motorists Rs 15 per hour; Rs 3,450 monthly rental for 24 hours; Rs 2,300 for monthly rental of 12 hours during the day; and Rs 1,750 for monthly rental of 12 hours at night.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74633584,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-291062,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/civic-body-throws-open-gariahat-parking-lot-on-a-few-hours-notice/articleshow/74632070.cms

309,['15/03/2020'],Faecal coliform bacteria level high in STPs: Report,"Representative image

CHANDIGARH: A Chandigarh pollution control committee (CPCC) report has indicated alarming level of faecal coliform bacteria in sewage treatment plants (STPs) in the city. The report, which the committee has shared with the municipal corporation, has shown presence of this bacteria, which is said to be the key factor for water-borne diseases.

A senior official of CPCC said the presence of faecal coliform bacteria in aquatic environments indicates that the water has been contaminated with the faecal material of man or animals. The presence of faecal contamination is an indicator that a potential health risk exists for individuals exposed to this water. They had recently checked all six STPs in city, he said.

While the standard limit for fecal coliform bacteria is 230 Most Probable Number (MPN), the report highlights figures touching 17 lakhs MPN.

The functioning of STPs has also worsened. The CPCC had detected shortcomings in the functioning of four out of six sewage treatment plants (STPs).

The four plants are releasing treated water with much higher bio-chemical oxygen demand (BOD) than the permissible level of the maximum 30 mg/litre. The latest report of January was compiled by the CPCC on the directions of the National Green Tribunal, which has been keeping an eye on water pollution in the city.

The STPs situated in Raipur Kalan , 3BRD, Maloya and Diggian are managed by the engineering department of the MC, while the engineering department of the administration maintains the STPs in Raipur Khurd and Dhanas.

Of the six, four STPs — Raipur Kalan, Raipur Khurd, Dhanas and 3 BRD — are releasing treated water with more BOD level than the permissible limit of 30 mg/litre.

The CPCC has also warned the MC to reduce pollutants in water discharged from these STPs or pay environmental compensation of Rs 10 lakh per month per STP from April 1, as directed by the NGT.

Recently, the Chandigarh Smart City Limited advertised the tender to upgrade five STPs in the city.

The administration in its action plan had submitted that they would upgrade all STPs in the city by 2022, but the NGT panel had directed it to complete the job by 2020. In August 2018, taking suo motu cognizance of media reports on pollution in the Ghaggar river, the NGT had directed the chief secretaries of Haryana, Punjab , Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh to constitute a special task force (STF) to clean the river. The NGT committee in Chandigarh, along with officials of Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC), had visited various points of Sukhna choe in Chandigarh.

The NGT in its previous order had said, ""The Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, provides for standards for the emission of pollutants. For different industries, the standards are laid down in Schedule I. The findings of the joint inspection report are that values of various parameters such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), faecal coliform, lead and iron were beyond permissible limits at most of the locations in Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab and Chandigarh.""

""It is, thus, fully established that there is a failure on the part of the statutory authorities, especially the pollution control boards in performing their duties. Under the statutory scheme, the boards are required to prosecute all those who may be responsible for discharging effluents beyond standards and to close all commercial establishments which are discharging such effluents apart from other penal measures required to be taken. They have failed to uphold the rule of law in spite of adequate powers given to them,"" the NGT had further said.

""It is high time that their composition is considered by the higher authorities and their accountability fixed by taking civil and criminal action against not only the violators of law but all those responsible for failure of their duties in taking action or shielding the culprits and thereby adversely affecting the environment and health of the inhabitants,"" the tribunal had said.

The department has set up a scanner and a team of doctors and medical professionals at the airport’s international arrival terminal, which used to be most active at 10pm every night when the Scoot flight from Singapore lands in Coimbatore. “With China being the epicentre of the virus outbreak, people from there would most likely take the China-Singapore-Coimbatore route to reach the city,” said a health department official. “However, with China continuing to be in lockdown and Covid-19 cases in Singapore continuing to increase, people seem to be cancelling travel to the city.

The commissioner cited a series of flaws and stated that natural course of justice was not followed as the suspect was not given a fair chance to defend himself against the externment order .

Lawyers pointed out that the order of externment can also be passed against a person if there is reasonable ground for believing that he/she is engaged or is about to be engaged in the commission of an offence involving force or violence.

The suspect, Saheb Yasin Khan Pathan alias Sattar Baba, has seven cases against him — five cheating, one outraging modesty of woman and another a non-cognizable offence — registered at the police stations of CIDCO, MIDC CIDCO and Buldhana.

While turning down the police’s decision, revenue divisional commissioner Sunil Kendrekar said that the man who has offences registered against him between 2014 and 2019 is being externed in the year 2019.

“Deputy commissioner of police (zone-II) has failed to give convincing grounds while externing the man from the areas other than where offences have been registered against him,” he said.

The divisional commissioner specifically cited that on reviewing the nature of offences registered against the suspect, it appears that he has cheating offences against him and that it does not appear that he is posing a threat to the complainants or witnesses in these cases.

“On reviewing the records, it also appears that in contrast of natural justice, the man has been externed without hearing his side,” said the order passed by Kendrekar.

Bhopal: Amid the political crisis confronting Kamal Nath government, ‘prevention is better than cure’ got a whole new meaning when health and finance minister Tarun Bhanot used the proverb in context of CoVID-19 on Saturday and hinted at a possible postponement of the make-or-break session of the assembly.

The budget session is scheduled to start on March 16. Neighbouring Chhattisgarh has already extended the Holi vacation of assembly till March 26 and will take a call later on whether it can reconvene on that day.

“Prevention is better than cure. Safety of all MP residents is paramount. It is not a political issue for us. We are seeking advice from our top health experts,” said Bhanot, who was given the health portfolio on Friday after Tulsi Silawat was removed from the cabinet by the Governor on the recommendation of CM Kamal Nath.

To add to it, general administration department minister Dr Govind Singh said, “All those coming from CoVID-19-impacted locations should be tested.” The 22 breakaway Congress MLAs are in Bengaluru, where six CoVID-19 cases have been detected, one of whom has died. It’s likely that the rebel Congress MLAs would have to undergo screening and tests for Coronavirus as and when they return to Bhopal.

The health department would be mandated to screen everyone before they enter Vidhan Sabha. Restriction on public gatherings came into force in MP on Saturday. Schools, colleges and cinemas are closed and CM Nath has ordered that any event where a large gathering is expected should be rescheduled.

“So far, MP has not reported any CoVID-19 cases. We want to keep it that way. We are taking measures to keep our citizens safe. I was to ask BJP if they support the measures to keep MP residents healthy and safe,” Bhanot said.

Health department’s principal secretary, Pallavi Jain Govil, held a press meet on Saturday to outline the safety and preventive measures being taken. A team of doctors will be deployed at Vidha Sabha, with respiratory masks and other equipment. Ambulances will be parked outside.

On March 5, The Madhya Pradesh Public Health Act, 1949 was invoked in the state. Chief medical and health officers and civil surgeons of districts are vested with all authority to ensure control of CoVID outbreak under Public Health ACT 1949. It vests magistrate-like powers with health officers, whereby they can quarantine and lock down identified areas to prevent an outbreak.

Apart from individual consumers, reduced gas prices augur well for industries, gas-based power projects and city gas distribution (CGD) companies.Globally, natural gas prices have already plummeted due to the slump in demand consequent to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The price of natural gas in spot markets have halved to around $3-4 per mmBtu, which is almost near its decadal low.Following global cues, the natural gas prices in India are estimated to be cut by a steep 25% from the next month.Based on the current formula for price determination, market estimates suggest that the domestic gas price is likely to be cut to US$ 2.5 per million metric British thermal units (mmBtu) for the six months beginning from April. The gas price was last reduced by 12.5% to US$ 3.23 per mmBtu effective from October 1, 2019.The Centre revises the price of domestically produced gas every six months based on average benchmark natural gas prices in US, UK, Canada and Russia. India’s natural gas requirement is met with both import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and locally produced gas, mainly by public sector majors, ONGC Ltd and Oil India Ltd.Domestic gas is provided on priority basis for consumption by individual households, transportation (compressed natural gas), fertilizers and power generation among other selected sectors.""After considering operation costs and taxes, one-third of the possible 25% reduction in domestic gas price will be passed on to the consumers. The retail prices of the piped natural gas (PNG) for residential consumers and compressed natural gas (CNG) are likely to reduce by 8-10%,"" said people associated with the CGD business.At present, the state-run Gujarat Gas Ltd charges Rs 712.10 (excluding tax) per mmBtu for domestic PNG and Rs 54.70 per kg for CNG in Gujarat. Adani Gas Ltd’s retail price for residential PNG and CNG in Ahmedabad is Rs 686.85 per mmBtu (excluding tax) and Rs 54.82 per kg, respectively.Low natural gas price has brightened prospects for industrial production as well. Ceramics, chemicals and a host of other industries in the state use natural gas as fuel.""We are expecting a reduction of Rs 3-4 per cubic metre in gas price supplied to ceramic tile makers in Morbi as the LNG prices have declined globally,"" said K G Kundariya, chairman, Wintel Ceramics Pvt Ltd. Morbi is the largest gas-consuming industrial cluster in India with daily consumption of approximately 60 lakh cubic meters of gas.""Reduction in natural gas prices will certainly bring down our production costs as natural gas accounts for 35% of the production expenses incurred,"" said Mukesh Ughreja, president, Morbi Ceramic Association. Low production cost is expected to help local players become more competitive in the international market and increase exports.""Those who already enjoy a strong position in the market will benefit in terms of better margins and profitability. Those who are trying to gain ground in the market, can do so by lowering their prices,"" he added.The ceramic industry faced tough times over the last two years. The low gas prices in the international market and strong possibility of price reduction in the domestic market have provided a much-needed cushion to the industry.""We are expecting a reduction of Rs 5 per cubic meter in prices of natural gas supplied to Morbi ceramic industry. If that happens, Morbi will be able to save Rs 3 crore in fuel cost per day,"" said Ughreja.The industries in Vapi and Ankleshwar are looking at the rate revision in gas prices after the LNG prices have reduced in the international market. Vapi and Ankleshwar are the hubs of chemicals, dyes and intermediates apart from other industries including glass, paper mills, bulk drugs, pharmaceuticals, etc.""Majority of the gas users in Ankleshwar are small-scale units. There are over 600 small scale units running on natural gas. The fall in LNG prices will benefit small industries including dyes and intermediates, agro chemicals, glass etc. in the region and increase their competitiveness in the international market,"" said Mahesh Patel, president of Ankleshwar Industrial Association (AIA).""Reduced natural gas price will bring down the generation cost of gas-based power projects. It will also be beneficial to stranded gas-based power projects as electricity generation from gas-based power plant becomes viable with lower gas prices,"" said K K Bajaj, an Ahmedabad-based energy and regulatory expert.Currently, gas-fired power projects with cumulative installed capacity of 3,898MW are stranded in Gujarat for want of gas.According to CRISIL, the viability of Rs 50,000 crore capital expenditure planned in the CGD space over the next four years across India has improved with the price of liquefied natural gas (LNG) expected to be subdued during the period.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dip-in-natural-gas-price-to-benefit-consumers-industries/articleshow/74632630.cms
317,['15/03/2020'],City techie stranded in Italy has an ‘adventurous’ return,"Coimbatore: The city-based software developer, who was stranded in Italy , finally returned to the hometown on Saturday morning. But this wasn’t before he put in a lot of planning and changing three flights.

While the central government had no problems in Indians stranded in Italy returning home with a Covid-19 negative certificate, Srinithin Jayabal was stranded in Rome as doctors refused to subject him to the test as he didn’t have any symptoms. Jayabal finally took a flight to another European country, which he didn’t wish to name, and from there flew down to Delhi. He then took a third flight to the city.

Jayabal describes his return to Indian soil at 1am on Saturday as “adventure”. According to him, he used his business contacts in Europe, including people based in the Vatican church, to find other European countries with hardly any Covid-19 cases, or an extremely low number. “Through my contacts, I confirmed that flights from that country were flying to India daily. I then flew to that country from Rome on Friday morning and took a direct flight to New Delhi. I am relieved that the immigration authorities here have cleared my entry after a detailed health check-up. They found me perfectly alright.”

Jayabal, however, has decided to quarantine himself for 14 days. The techie, who flew to Italy on February 26, was stranded there since Wednesday, when the entire country went into a lockdown. On Tuesday, the country had recorded more than 10,000 Covid-19 cases. “While I was staying in a hotel, the plight of many other Indians, including a pregnant woman with a child, was pathetic. They were in the airport for two days,” he said. What made the situation worse for Indians was shutting down of all consular services by the Indian embassy. “As a result, there was no update or news for the stranded people from the hotline operator.”

On March 10, Jayabal and 15 other Indians were not allowed to board their flight to India by the Emirates authorities. The airline said the Indian government had instructed them not to allow Indian passport holders to return from Italy without Covid-19 negative certificates. “Getting tested for the virus in Italy is not allowed without symptoms, because the hospitals are booked to their capacity. So, it was impossible to get the certificate. My mails and tweets to the external affairs ministry yielded no response,” said Jayabal describing the desperate times that he went through.

The departments have also been issued specific instructions to deposit the salaries as well as allowances of April 2020 with 11 public sector banks (PSBs) specified by the state. These PSBs include State Bank of India, Indian Bank, Bank of Maharashtra, Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Central Bank of India, Andhra Bank, Corporation Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Union Bank of India and Bank of Baroda. With the latest move, the private sector banks are all set to lose transactions running in to several thousand crores that are paid in salaries each month to state government employees.

In addition to this, as a ‘precautionary measure,’ those having pension accounts with private or cooperative banks have been asked to switch to public sector banks. The government communication has listed names of 13 PSBs — SBI, Syndicate Bank, Bank of Baroda, Corporation Bank, Allahabad Bank, Indian Bank, Bank of Maharashtra, Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Central Bank of India, Andhra Bank, Union Bank of India and Indian Overseas Bank — who have tie-ups with the government for handling pension accounts.

The state has even asked the public enterprises as well as corporations to follow suit. The directives have been issued to the administrative staff to ensure the implementation of Government Resolution (GR) in this regard.

The decision by the Maharashtra government on Friday has been taken despite the Reserve Bank of India deputy governor NS Vishwanathan writing a letter to the state governments across the country and asking them not to shift their deposits from private sector banks to public.

The state’s move is, however, welcomed by the public sector banks which otherwise were lagging behind in terms of getting new bank accounts. All India Bank Employees Association joint secretary Devidas Tuljapurkar said, “We can say it took several thousand crores of public money getting swindled off by big corporate houses allegedly in connivance with private banks for making the government realise gravity of the issue. We welcome the state’s move to not only park.”

BHOPAL: Chief minister Kamal Nath on Saturday shot a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah, asking for the safe return of the 22 Congress MLAs before budget session starts in the state assembly on March 16. “My request to you is to utilize your powers as Union home minister and securely bring back the 22 imprisoned Congress MLAs so they may do their duties as legislators without fear or allurement,” CM wrote.

In the letter, Nath gave a detailed account of how the state BJP was poaching on Congress alliance MLAs from March 3. “Through this letter, I want to draw your attention to the incidents that started from march 3, when three Congress MLAs, BSP’s Rambai and one independent MLA were taken to a hotel situated in Manesar, Gurugram,” CM Nath wrote. “At the right time, two ministers reached the hotel and released Mrs Rambai and her family members from the captivity of BJP leaders,” he explained.

The chief minister said that three Congress MLAs and one independent were taken to Bangalore in a chartered plane. He alleged that BJP MLA Arvind Bhadoria and party office-bearer Ashish Tiwari were mentioned in the list of passengers and they took the Congress legislators to Bangalore.

CM’s letter also stated that three chartered planes flew more Congress MLAs to Bangalore and 19 MLAs were lodged in a resort there. Former BJP minister Uma Shankar Gupta, former MLA Sudarshan and former MP Hemant Khandelwal went along with them. “Over time, the numbers have now grown to 22 and are under the protection of the Bangalore police. Photographs show some BJP leaders with these MLAs. All expenditure is being borne by the Karnataka BJP ,” CM Nath alleged.

Kamal Nath said he has information that all means of communication have been taken away from them and the MLAs are being held captive. He also narrated the incident when Narayan Choudhary, father of MLA Manoj Choudhary was not allowed to meet his own son when he reached the resort in Bangalore. He argued that the photographs and videos released of these MLAs reveal that they are being pressurized to behave and speak in a certain manner.

“You will agree that there is reason of a floor test if 22 MLAs are being held hostage outside the state,” CM Nath wrote. “It is an unprecedented situation when on one hand, the BJP is asking for floor test and on the other, holding many Congress MLAs captive,” he added.

329,['15/03/2020'],Calling even one’s wife prostitute amounts to insulting woman’s modesty: HC,"Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court while quashing an FIR registered by a woman against her husband, who is a senior government official, said that to call a woman a prostitute or even saying that she earned money by indulging in prostitution was tantamount to insulting the modesty of a woman.

A 25-year-old woman had lodged a complaint against her husband with Nanded police in 2018. She stated in her complaint that she had married the senior government official on May 14, 2017. However, her husband did not treat her well post marriage. He beat her and called her a prostitute and claimed that she earned money by indulging in prostitution. She further alleged that her husband married her for the sake of relatives as he was a homosexual.

As per her complaint, her husband called her on January 1, 2018 and hurled expletives. Again on February 27 and 28, 2018, he sent her Whatsapp messages reiterating his allegations against her. She further claimed that he called her relatives too and defamed her character.

Subsequently, an FIR was filed on March 5, 2018 on the basis of which an offence was registered under sections 294 (obscene acts and songs to the annoyance of others), 500 (defamation), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 507 (criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication) of the IPC. The man filed a criminal writ petition in the high court seeking that the FIR filed against him be quashed.

While quashing the FIR to the extent of section 294 of the IPC, the bench comprising Justices T V Nalawade and M G Sewlikar observed, “WhatsApp cannot be a public place if messages are exchanged on personal accounts of two persons. If these messages had been posted on a WhatsApp group, in that case the same could have been called a public place because all the members of the group would have access to those messages. Therefore, sending personal messages on WhatsApp will not amount to utterance of obscene words in public place. Hence, section 294 of the IPC cannot be invoked.”

The bench further observed, “To call a woman, even if she is one’s own wife, a prostitute, and to say that she earns money by indulging in prostitution amounts to insulting the modesty of a woman.”

It further said, “There is prima-facie evidence to indicate that the offence falls under section 509 of the IPC (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman). However, the prosecution is at liberty to carry out investigation to ascertain whether an offence under section 509 of the IPC can be registered.”

330,['15/03/2020'],AGVS — Where academics and agri-preneurhip go hand in hand,"BHAGYASHREE & SACHIN DESHPANDE with kids

Nestled in the lush green swathes of land parcels, about 40 kms from Nagpur, is a school that goes beyond the traditional curriculum to ensure that education and entrepreneurship go hand-in-hand.

Abhyudaya Global Village School (AGVS), in Saoner’s Bawangaon village, has become the epicentre of an educational revolution which is thinking out of the box to provide students not just with a certificate but also vocational skills. And with free education for girls and subsidy of almost 70% for boys, students from poor farming communities now have a chance to get education at par with their urban counterparts.

Bhagyashree and Sachin Deshpande, left their IT jobs in metro cities, to continue her father PK Gandhi’s mission. “In 2010, my father founded AGVS with a vision to provide a fertile ground for organic education to help children so that they become self aware and responsible individuals,” says Bhagyashree.

The school caters mostly to children of farmers who live in a 15km radius of Bawangaon. They are unable to afford quality English medium education. “Even if someone did have to the money to pay the high fees, such schools are at a great distance from these cluster of villages. Transportation is non-existent and that hinders progress of these children who later in life are both without proper education and skills to earn a steady income,” says Sachin.

In 2013, the Deshpande couple joined AGVS and took it upon themselves to redesign its pedagogy and offer to students something they would never have been able to get access to and that too with fees less than Rs600 per month. Attractive school uniforms, pick up and drop by certified school buses right from their villages and now a residential wing has ensured that the school’s enrolment went from 28 in 2010 to 317 currently.

With urban migration increasing every year, there is a valid concern of food security as farming as an occupation is declining in rural areas. AGVS is trying to rekindle a spirit of agripreneurship in kids so that in future they at least don’t discard farming as a career option. And this rekindling is done with amazing subtleness. To teach math, children are taken to the school’s farm and asked to assess how many seeds can be planted in a certain patch of land. Once sowing is done, biology as a subject creeps in with students following progress of the crops that are growing.

“When children see theoretical concepts being implemented in real life, it opens up new dimensions for them,” says Bhagyashree.

Kids here are encouraged to speak their mind on the campus and not be cowed down under the weight of ‘authority’ or ‘protocol’. “In class, students are never afraid to ask questions and in this way their self confidence has increased. We sent them for various competitions in other cities and they won awards as well as recognition,” says Sachin.

Subject periods are not bound by time as teachers spill it over to the next period if the class gets interesting. “We go with the flow. Our students dictate the way learning happens in this school,” says Bhagyashree.

Their three year-old son Shaswat will soon be getting enrolled at AGVS as the Deshpande couple believes in walking the talk. For now, AGVS is keeping the dreams of students of farmers alive through various donors and hopes that they can reach out to more underprivileged children as benefactors increase.

331,['15/03/2020'],"State govt finally acts, shuts schools &amp; colleges till Mar 31","Nagpur: After a shocking decision taken earlier to limit school and college closures only to Pune region, the state government finally decided to extend the decision for entire state. All schools and colleges in state will now be shut till at least March 31 to contain the spread of coronavirus.

On Saturday, NMC commissioner Tukaram Munde directed all schools to shut down till March 31.

Parents and schools across the state were fuming and questioning the logic of government of not announcing a statewide closure of educational institutes where crores of students study cumulatively. Taking stock of the situation, the state’s health department wrote to their education counterparts asking for a complete shutdown of schools and colleges in state till at least March 31.

Parents, schools and colleges welcomed the decision saying it was need of the hour.

Rajan Agrawal, a parent, said, “I am very happy to know that the state government has acted in the interest of students and closed down schools. Young children are going in jam-packed vans, autos, buses then reaching a school where thousand others are there was always a bit risky. This closure will allow things to settle down.”

But even before the government was roused into taking action, many schools in Nagpur had already taken a decision to close down schools and control spread of the virus.

Modern School, Koradi, and School of Scholars (SOS) took the lead in declaring an almost full closure in the coming week of primary and higher sections. At least three other schools, whose names are being withheld, had shut down.

Test results of the kin were still awaited at the time of going to press. Apart from this, both children of Nagpur’s first coronavirus patient, had tested negative for the virus on Thursday.

Modern School’s trustee Neeru Kapai said there is no direct connection with any known coronavirus case, and her decision is only a precautionary step. “It was a practical decision which needed to be taken,” said Kapai. Multi-branch school chain School of Scholars’s director Abha Meghe said “Since we had already shut down the pre-primary wing, it was a natural step to move on to primary section.”

A local coaching classes too shut down part of its institute. Nisha Kothari, director of IIT-Home said “I have informed parents that as a precautionary measure against Covid-19, we are calling off classes for the next six days. May extend this if required.” Kothari has instructed outstation parents that they may pick up students staying at hostels. “We will guide students on precautions to be taken while travelling and sufficient homework will be given,” said Kothari.

But over the years, the country’s largest man-made fabric (MMF) hub in Surat has become the second largest denim hub, grabbing 8% share of the total manufacturing capacity in the country.Until 2015, there were four denim plants with the installed capacity of 100 million metres per annum in Surat.In a short span of four years, three new denim plants including Lodz Denim and JRD Denim at Ankleshwar and Signet Denim at Palsana near Surat with annual capacity of 20 million metres each have set up their plants by adding up to the total annual installed capacity to 160 million metres — 8% of the total 1,550 million metres per annum produced in the country.The denim journey of Surat, which already meets over 40% of the polyester fabric demand in the country annually, started with the setting up of the first denim plant by R&B denims at Palsana in 2012, some 20 kilometres away from Surat, with the installed capacity of 30 million metres per annum. The company has invested about Rs 500 crore in a phased manner till 2017 by setting up backward integration of cotton yarn spinning.Anubha Denim has 20 million metres capacity. Rajasthan-based Sri Rajlaxhmi denim has operationalised a plant at Palsana with capacity of 30 million metres.

Still, there is a huge potential in the denim business as the demand for the fabric is ever increasing in the domestic and international market.""Industry sources said that due to over-capacity and GST implication, the unorganised sector was working at utililsation level of 65% till last year. However, there has been improvement in capacity utilisation to about 75% owing to no fresh investment and increasing focus on exports.A majority of the denim manufacturers have export exposure of about 45% of their annual denim fabric production.

“Drones can address supply chain shortcomings in the healthcare sector, reducing stockouts and wastage. The deaths due to diseases such as dengue, conditions like postpartum haemorrhage and loss of blood due to accidents can be addressed through faster responses, higher-quality products and better availability. Health system shortcomings, especially those felt in rural communities suffering from a lack of infrastructure, can be addressed by pressing drones into service,” he said.

337,['15/03/2020'],HC quashes FIR against people booked for protesting in front PS,"Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court quashed an FIR registered by the Jalgaon police against members of the Bhilla community stating that it was not right on the part of the police to file a case just because some people staged a sit-in agitation outside the station demanding justice.

Manish Razzak Tadvi and seven other people from the Bhilla community had approached the high court through lawyer C V Dharurkar seeking to quash the FIR filed against them under various sections of the IPC by Adawad police in Pachora taluka of Jalgaon district.

In February 2018, members of the Bhilla community had staged a protest in the premises of Jalgaon police station demanding action and inquiry into the death of one of their relatives.

The court noted, “Arman Tadvi was called to the police station on February 27, 2018. He did not return home after leaving the police station and committed suicide the same day.” Arman’s parents went to the police station on February 28, 2018, and raised their grievance that one Bebabai and one Sunil Wagh had registered a false complaint against Arman.

His parents further alleged that Gopal Patil, a constable attached with Jalgaon police, were in connivance with the duo in preparing the false report against Arman. According to his parents, the false report, coupled with the threats from the police, led Arman to commit suicide.

Following the incident, an association of the Bhilla community—Adwasi Tadvi Bhilla Ekta Manch, Yaval district Jalgaon—decided to launch an agitation to propel Arman’s parents cause for justice for their son and gathered in front of the police station.

While quashing the FIR, the bench comprising Justices T V Nalawade and M G Sewlikar observed that there was no evidence to show that anybody had created trouble for anyone. “It is a fact that they had raised their grievance as Arman had committed suicide following the registration of a non-cognisable offence and the circumstances under which he was called to the police station for enquiry,’’ the bench noted.

“There is no allegation against them (applicants) that they had caused disturbance or had damaged any property. The police station is required to be kept open for 24 hours. Persons like the applicants have the right to raise their grievance even against police officers if they feel that the officers are not acting fairly. Only because they gathered and sat for agitation feeling that justice had not been meted out to them, it is not proper on the part of the police to file a case against them of the aforesaid nature,” observed the bench.

The bench added that the police needed to take a human approach. “This court holds that it will be abuse of process of law if the applicants are directed to face the trial for aforesaid offences,’’ said the bench.

“Our team had detailed discussions with the government on March 9 where we had specifically advised them to shut down schools, as the virus could spread through children, who have weak immune system. If any one child gets contracted, he s/he could become a carrier of the disease not only to other students, but also to parents, teachers and non-teaching staff,” state IMA president Dr Avinash Bhondwe told media, while expressing surprise on government’s delayed move.

Strongly justifying the need to close schools, he said the IMA had suggested to defer all examinations by at least two months and conduct it in May/June to avoid the children getting exposed to the disease.

“The government told us that state board exams are currently underway and postponing it would disturb the students and lead to panic. Since life is more precious than exams, the government must take proactive steps to prevent threats to young lives. The IMA would fully support them in this regard,” said the IMA chief, who was accompanied by Dr Kush Jhunjhunwala and other IMA members.

With a view to minimize threats arising out of coronavirus, the IMA has directed its 42,500 members across 212 branches in state to screen the patients coming to them and refer to the government if suspected cases are found. “We’ve also decided to spread awareness among the citizens on how to wash hands in scientific way like doctors do after performing surgeries and also on not getting infected and how to dispose of the masks, which can be used only once,” Bhondwe said.

Importantly, the IMA has started a ‘campaign against rumours’ from the city to fight menace of fake messages being circulated on the social media on Covid-19 pandemic, which often create panic. “We’ve posted our WhatsApp numbers where people can upload any post. We will try to verify its authenticity from genuine sources and reply them. If found fake, offensive, misleading or antisocial, those would be reported to cybercrime cells of police for further action,” he said.

Complaint against Mumbai doc for spreading misleading post

The IMA would be lodging a police complaint against a veteran doctor working with the government agencies for his “very objectionable” and “highly misleading” post on the social media. “The doctor having MD qualification is telling people that there is no threat of coronavirus to Indians, as their immunity system is strong. He also told them to drink milk mix with Haldi and also use cow dung and urine to stay away from the disease. According to him, these substances act as anti-oxidants in the body. We can’t believe that a highly qualified medico can utter such words,” he said.

Since morning Bhondwe received over 100 messages and majority of them turned out to be fake ones. “Don’t believe on any messages unless those are certified by World Health Organization (WHO) or the government,” he said.

GMR group said the MoU with Ras Al Khaimah International Airport and SpiceJet has been signed to promote exports of agricultural products from India to UAE and its neighbouring countries via Hyderabad and to create a dedicated freight corridor to leverage the agro and farming sector potential from Telangana and its neighbouring regions.

This has been done in line with the Ministry of Civil Aviation’s (MoCA) Krishi Udan Scheme to boost agro product exports and aid farmers in transporting agricultural products.

Special arrangements are being made for handling the goods both at exporting and destination airports and the target markets for this initiative includes Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and Bahrain, GMR group said.

On the other hand, the MoU between Airbus and Telangana government has been inked to develop a proof of concept to explore IoT (Internet of Things) sensor-based monitoring of environment at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport as part of sustainable aviation.

Under this MoU, GHIAL will allow the Airbus BizLab to deploy and test its AvIPSUM solution, which is a platform that combines IoT, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data analytics.

This will be utilized to measure air, weather, noise and all elements contributing to carbon footprint, thus building an emission inventory database that will help analyse and create interventions and recommendations of high impact areas.

The solution will enable faster decision making on new initiatives and help monitor the progress of environmental clearances for these new initiatives, GMR group added.

Within a month of Dulat’s secret mission to Kashmir, Farooq Abdullah’s detention order under the stringent Public Safety Act was revoked by the government on March 13. The NC functionary’s release is seen in political circles as something that could be a precursor to resumption of a broad-based political process in the UT that has remained under lockdown much of the six months ever since Article 370 of the Constitution was nullified on August 5 last year.

In an interview to journalist Karan Thapar , Dulat said when he met Abdullah in Srinagar , he found the former CM “tired and certainly not looking his best”.The former CM stressed that he is fully committed to India and had brought up his children in the same way.

Dulat said when he first contacted the home ministry for “meeting” Farooq Abdullah sometime in November last year, there was no clearance. However, on February 9, he received a phone call from the home ministry saying he could go to Kashmir if he so wished, the former RAW head said.

He told Thapar that the clearance from the home ministry “would have happened with the knowledge and concurrence of NSA Doval and this means the NSA was fully in the loop”.

He said though his visit to Srinagar was a private one, the IB in Srinagar provided transport to take him from the airport to Abdullah’s residence and back to the airport during his visit to the Valley. He said that shortly after his return, he was rung by the home ministry to find out how the trip had gone.

Dulat said he spoke to Abdullah again after revocation of his detention and the latter told him he would visit the national Capital in 15 days and by then the Budget session is likely to end. He also said Abdullah was recently operated for cataract in both his eyes.

“We don’t think that any husband left with some mercy would give priority to his demand of money in such a situation and leave his wife in lurch, extremely bruised and traumatized. No husband having any element of humanity, come what may his differences with wife, would display such a behaviour, cruel and callous, towards her,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Madhav Jamdar tersely observed.

As per the FIR against 36-year-old husband and his parents, when wife landed in the US on June 19 last year for staying with him after the marriage, he inquired on whether she brought dowry amount of Rs30,000 dollars, (Approximately Rs22.2 lakh). When she denied, he refused to open the door for a long time, until the American cops arrived and asked him to let her in.

“The husband, instead of cohabiting with her, left her alone and went outstation. This happened in spite of the fact that his wife travelled all the way from India to a faraway foreign land like the USA, all alone. This act, it could be anybody’s guess, must have prima facie, make her feel distressed and terrorized,” the judges said while flaying the man.

After solemnization of their marriage on December 24, 2018, wife’s in-laws started harassing her for the dowry from third day in the form of jewellery. Both used to say something atrocious which would cause mental torture to her.

According to the woman, she was forced to go back to India by the husband. When she started staying at in-laws home in Ravi Nagar, she was continued to be subjected to cruelty, which led her to lodge a police complaint under Section 498-A of the IPC and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.

On receiving notices, the husband and his parents knocked HC’s doors for quashing of FIR contending that the woman had labelled false allegations against them.

“We find that the allegations, taken at their face value and accepting them in their entirety, an offence of cruelty punishable under Section 498-A is prima facie, strongly made out against all the petitioners. Those are specific and they place on record the particular instances and certain acts committed by all of them which amount to cruelty in the eye of law,” the judges said, adding that those acts were committed at various times on dates.

“In any case, we haven’t understood on why a newly married husband would decide to send back his wife almost a month before the last date of VISA expiry rather that booking a return ticket, just a few days before expiry,” they pointed out before rejecting husband’s plea.

344,['15/03/2020'],Coronavirus: Silent cinemas take a toll as malls stick to hygiene drill in Delhi,"Not only malls, the shops at CP have also recorded a sharp dip in the footfall.

NEW DELHI: The closing down of cinema halls till March 31 has collateral damage: malls and shopping centres, many of which are designed around the movie experience. As it is, the fear of the novel coronavirus has already halved footfall from last week, and now the cinema shutdown will further affect business.

But given the nature of the threat, these commercial centres can do little other than to take counter measures such as disinfection of vulnerable surfaces, providing employees with masks and keeping hand sanitisers at the entrances.

“Almost a third of the traffic in our malls comprises moviegoers,” said Abhishek Bansal of Pacific Malls at Tagore Garden and Dwarka, both of which have six cinema screens each. “So with the restrictions on movies, our footfall is directly impacted. In turn, this will also affect our retail and food court sales.” Not to worsen a bad situation, Bansal makes sure the staff are regularly tested and every possible effort is made to maintain high hygiene in the retail spaces.

Coronavirus outbreak live coverage

At the DLF Mall in Saket, visitors squirt hand sanitisers into their palms at the entrances. The crowd is visibly less than usual. At Select City Walk nearby, a staff member of an outlet said, “For now things are ok, but the state government may soon announce more restrictions on the malls. We have to wait for some days to see how things evolve.”

Delhi government has ordered a daily disinfection for all commercial complexes where people gather in big numbers. Pintu, a member of the cleaning staff at Ambience Mall in Vasant Kunj, confirmed that teams now worked every day to disinfect the escalators and common services and important public spaces. “We are taking all precautions,” the staffer asserted. At another mall, the outlets, including play zones for children, now have hand sanitisers at easy reach and staff standing by to coax people into using them.

Shoppers aren’t deserting the malls yet, of course. Anshul Chaturvedi, a Malviya Nagar resident shopping at DLF Mall, said there was only so much precaution that one could take. “In the end, it is entirely likely that you will still catch the infection despite the precautions,” he reasoned. On the weekends, there are usually around 50,000 visitors milling around. But these number are dwindling. With cinema auditoriums closing, the crowd will be further pruned.

A mall manager who didn’t wish to be identified said it is wait-and-watch time for them. “Movie watching had become a family affair in the past few years. Families came to see films and enjoyed a meal at the food court or the restaurants,” he said. “We know that the coronavirus threat will impact this aspect of malls. We are carefully observing the evolving situation.”

While restaurants at the mall are already facing a dip in business, many daily wagers employed in various capacity at the shopping hubs expressed apprehensions about retaining their jobs in this economically challenging situation. In particularly, temporary employment is already being adversely impacted by the shutdown. A mall supervisor explained that the rush for movies is normally so high at certain times, including weekends, that many outlets hire temporary staff to manage the crowds. “Such jobs are hit with the cinema screens going dark,” he said. He added darkly, “The economic impact of the novel coronavirus will probably kill more people than the virus itself.”

The health officials had identified around 58 first-point contacts of which 28 were at high risk, meaning they very in direct touch with the patients.

After the IT professional, who returned from the US on March 6, tested positive on Wednesday, his family and close contacts were immediately taken to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) while he remained admitted at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH). Later, his wife and a colleague too tested positive.

On Friday, the health officials prepared a list of 45 persons who came in direct contact with the IT professional and his wife and had to be tested for Covid-19. Similarly, a list of 13 persons was finalized. Initially, the list had only names and contact numbers which were taken from the confirmed patients following their interviews about their whereabouts when they reportedly contracted the virus.

The task of calling up these first-point suspects was assigned to NMC’s health department where a control room has been set up to deal with the cases. Officials had to take down their addresses apart from additional details and send ambulance to ferry them to nearby hospitals for taking the swabs.

Sources said municipal commissioner Tukaram Munde on Saturday pulled up officials from NMC’s health department for failing to call up these people. Munde didn’t answer to TOI’s call and messages.

When TOI called up NMC health officer Bhavana Sonkusale, she said she was in a meeting and will talk later. She too didn’t answer queries till evening.

Sources said the officials could take down addresses of only a couple of people from the list. They alleged that the officials were lethargic even at the time of a national diaster-like situation. “This is poor administration by the civic chief and health officials,” they said.

A day before, divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar said that 80 persons from six districts of Nagpur division have been notified as suspects till date. Out of them, 31 were admitted to various government facilities in the division during the last two weeks and they have successfully completed 14 days of quarantine period. Altogether 49 patients are under home isolation as well as admitted to hospitals.

Standing the tests of time, Zydus Cadila has now turned into a global healthcare company with revenues more than US $2 billion. In an exclusive interview with TOI’s Kalpesh Damor, the third-generation entrepreneur and managing director of Zydus Group, Dr. Sharvil Patel shares the group’s journey.How has Zydus Cadila’s journey been so far?When we started out in 1995, I would say survival was our priority for the first five years. Our mission was to bring back the lost market share in India. We had tumbled to 17th or 18th rank. We, however, bounced back into the Top 5 by the year 2000. Our goal was ‘1,000 by 2,000’ and we achieved the Rs1,000 crore revenue target as well.The next five years, the focus was to become profitable. The company had gone public, made investments and acquired German Remedies and few other brands to expand our reach and ensure better profitability. Till 2005, Zydus was very India-centric. Around this time, we started building our global business.After we tapped into the international market, we embarked upon the ‘Healthy Billion’ goal to become a billion-dollar company. The goal was achieved by 2011.We constantly strive to grow by building new capabilities and business areas. Our aspirations have been to become a strong player in India and the US as well as grow in emerging markets. In the last five years, we have built a strong position in the US.How has your journey in Zydus been?I joined the group in 2005 and spent the next few years understanding the business and its complexities. In 2007, we started with a clear focus and goal to achieve the Healthy Billion and channelized all our energies into achieving this.This was a highpoint for the entire organization. Our long-term focus has been on building capabilities on the R&D side for new businesses such as biologics, vaccines and NCEs. We believe that these businesses have immense potential and our focus now is to scale them up in years to come. I believe a company cannot grow beyond a certain scale unless you have a differentiated product portfolio backed by innovation.What is your target for the years to come?As I said, we have laid a solid foundation for our future businesses such as novel biologics, vaccines, new chemical entities (NCEs) and IP protected products. Over the next 10 years, we hope to become commercially successful in these initiatives. These could be the future growth drivers for the organization. The injectables franchise is another area which we want to build for the US market.Zydus Cadila has made many acquisitions, will your focus remain on inorganic growth?While we have a lot of mergers and acquisitions (M&As), we have not grown just because of acquisitions. Except German Remedies and Heinz India, most of our acquisitions were to gain market access. Our story is about making a foray into markets through small M&As and grow organically in those markets. We will continue to explore such opportunities through M&As.What are your capex plans?We have earmarked Rs 600-700 crore capital expenditure for FY20. Our capex plan will remain on an average in the same range for the next 3-4 years.How has Zydus Wellness been doing after acquiring Heinz India?The integration of Heinz India with Zydus Wellness is over. If you look at the consolidated picture, five of our seven brands are market leaders in their categories. With this integration, we are now aspiring to double our direct distribution reach to 5 lakh points, which means better visibility and it will increase sales also.There is still a lot of scope for improvement in our marketing and branding, so we are working on that as well. Our aspiration is that the business will grow in high double digits in next five years.Zydus has been the first to initiate work on the coronavirus vaccine, what is driving the company to take up such initiatives?If there is an epidemic, the only way to protect the country is through vaccination. During the H1N1 outbreak, our view was that we as a country should also be capable of indigenously developing our vaccines.We never thought of developing the swine flu vaccine as a commercial venture. So, this is why we have started out with a fast track programme to put out a vaccine for coronavirus. We are working simultaneously on two platforms and the aim is to make it available at the earliest.How did the China shutdown following coronavirus outbreak affect pharma industry here?Till March end, I think, everybody is protected in terms of supply of APIs. Costs, however, have gone up. There will not be any major supply disruption as companies have built their inventories. But, if this situation continues beyond March, then it could be a matter of concern for supplies. The immediate effect will be on antibiotics, anti-infectives and anti-retrovirals due to supply constraints.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/innovation-based-products-will-lead-our-long-term-growth/articleshow/74632671.cms

Nagpur: Doctors at both the government hospitals in the city and from hospitals run by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) are working day and night to provide relief to the Covid-19 patients and suspects. The three positive cases detected on Saturday have increased the responsibility of doctors working in GMCH.

“Earlier, we had only suspects in our hospital as only the confirmed positive case was being treated at the IGGMCH. But on Friday, we got two positive cases. Instantly, our teams swung into action and shifted them to separate rooms in the isolation ward,” said Dr Avinash Gawande, medical superintendent of GMCH.

Teams of doctors in GMCH have been given kits and floggers to ensure their safety. “Air and ward sterilization work is being done frequently. We have purchased 38 specialized machines for room sterilization. Some of them will be used in crowded places in the hospital,” said Dr Gawande.

The hospital has also started enhancing the capacity of the isolation ward by 30 beds. Ward No. 49 was vacated and work to install infrastructure like oxygen lines began. The new ward is expected to be ready by next week.

IGGMCH also received 2 suspects on Friday. They were not related to the positive patients but had separate travel records to Dubai and Italy. Two teams of doctors at IGGMCH are treating the first positive covid-19 patient by following all medical protocol.

“The patient is recovering fast. He was not having fever on Friday. He is cooperating very well with the doctors,” said Dr Ajay Keoliya, dean, IGGMCH (Mayo hospital).

Lab testing facility at Mayo Hospital received 16 swab samples from Vidarbha on Friday. They included 9 from Yavatmal, 4 from GMCH (all colleagues of the first covid-19 positive patient), 2 admitted in Mayo hospital and one sent from GMCH Gondia. This suspect has a travel history to Dubai.

A resident doctor informed that there is a scarcity of masks at the hospital for doctors and surgeons.

NMC doctors are playing an important role in contacting and counselling people who came into close contact with positive covid-19 patients. A senior official in NMC’s health department said that the paramedical staff collected swab samples of the four suspects at GMCH on Friday.

Doctors from the NMC team are also talking to the woman patient who is admitted in the GMCH and getting details of her close contacts.

Nagpur: In the light of coronavirus outbreak in the city, district collector Ravindra Thakare on Saturday made it clear that religious processions and large gatherings will not be allowed.

“The state government has asked civic authorities not to give permission for large public gatherings, which also includes religious processions like shobha yatra,” said Thakare.

The trustees and committee members of Ram Mandir at Ram Nagar have decided to abide by the government’s instructions and called off the Ramnavami shoba yatra scheduled on April 2. On the other hand, the shobha yatra taken out by Poddareshwar Ram Mandir on Central Avenue will be held as planned, said its organizers.

Supporting the collector’s decision, commissioner of police Bhushan Kumar Upadhyay said that they will ensure that the state government’s orders are followed.

The committee members of Ram Mandir at Ram Nagar held a meeting on Saturday where the decision to call off the shobha yatra was taken. “For us, the priority is public health. We would not want to risk the lives of devotees in the name of religious procession. We might plan a small walk from the ground nearby to the temple, so that very few people can participate,” said Ravi Waghmare, president, West Nagpur Nagrik Mandal which conducts the shobha yatra.

Ajay Dabir, secretary of the temple, said, “We have been organizing the shobha yatra from the last 46 years. It doesn’t matter if it’s not held this year because public safety is more important. We will organize a mahaprasad after virus is brought under control.”

Members of Poddareshwar Ram Mandir will be conducting a meeting on Sunday but it seems they are planning to go ahead with the shobha yatra. “ Why there is so much fear in the city about public gatherings and schools and colleges are being shut down abruptly? We cannot stop people from being a part of the procession,” said Puneet Poddar, trustee of Poddareshwar Ram Mandir.

However, Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s fire emergency services department has refused to give firefighting compliance certificate to the outlet citing the building where the outlet was opened, has not yet obtained first no-objection certificate and compliance certificate of the basement plus ground plus nine-storey building.

A company statement stated that at McDonald’s, we follow the highest standards of food safety and hygiene. “We have the FSSAI and shop and establishment license to operate the restaurant. We are committed to comply with all the applicable laws and regulations,” it said. However, it avoided a reply when asked if it has obtained firefighting compliance or not.

Fire station officer of Civil Lines Rajendra Dubey told TOI that the department has issued no no-objection certificate (provisional certificate) or firefighting compliance certificate to the restaurant. The outlet has come up in Poonam Chambers, which has already been declared fire unsafe. The building has already violated sanctioned plan and the building owner has neither applied for provisional no-objection certificate nor obtained compliance certificate by installing firefighting system. “So, we have not issued any firefighting compliance to McDonald’s,” said Dubey.

The Civil Lines fire station has already informed the assistant municipal commissioner Mangalwari zone about the permission sought for firefighting compliance of the block in Poonam Chambers.

On January 20, the Hardcastle Restaurants Private Limited, which is operating the new outlet, had submitted an application to the Civil Lines fire station seeking firefighting compliance certificate. It has already installed fire extinguishers, kitchen suppression system, gas leak detector system, store electrical load, fire resistant door etc. “Despite this, we could not issue fire compliance to any of the occupants,” he explained.

According to Dubey, the fire department is following the issue of the building’s firefighting compliance since 2015. Many times the fire department tried to conduct inspection of the building, but the proprietor of the building refused to cooperate. “They never accepted any single notice served by the department,” he said.

On March 7 too the fire department tried to serve a three-hour notice to inspect the building, but the proprietor of the building did not allow.

Officials from the department of animal husbandry are now visiting poultry farms in state and surveying losses occurred due to coronavirus related rumours.

Akash Khurade, a poultry farmer from Chandur Bazar, said that a team of two officials not only visited his and other farms in nearby villages on Friday.

“Two persons from Chandur Bazar Panchayat Samiti arrived to conduct survey. They inquired about the losses I suffered in last three weeks since the coronavirus related rumours started spreading,” said Khurade. A senior official Animal husbandry department of Amravati district said that survey has been initiated after they received orders from divisional office.

“Due to the rumours that coronavirus spreads through non-vegetarian food, many people have stopped eating chicken. Due to this, poultry farmers are suffering huge losses. After survey of these losses, government will think of providing some relief to these farmers,” said the official.

Dr Raja Dudhbale, president of Vidarbha Poultry farmers association said that they should be helped on the lines of farmers who suffer losses due to natural calamities. “All our efforts to clarify that the chicken is safe for all were failed as people still believe in the rumours. Many small poultry farmers who don’t have any backing of farmland, are devastated. Government should come out with a relief package for us,” he said.

Additional police force will be deployed so that there is no nuisance on the route. Army has made all arrangements to keep them in isolation.According to senior army sources, the evacuated persons will be kept under the supervision of expert doctors at the military station. Resources, equipment, doctors and nursing staff from various military hospitals from Jodhpur, Pune etc. have been brought to Jaisalmer for the purpose.

354,['15/03/2020'],‘Proper implementation of law can curb exploitation of minors’,"Mushtak Pathan, the district child protection officer (DCPO), feels enactments like Juvenile Justice (JJ) (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 and Protection of children from sexual offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, have the potential to act as a shield against exploitation of minors, whether sex trafficking, forced marriages, bonded labour, begging, prostitutions and so on. As an expert in the field, Pathan feels that the legal provisions should be implemented to also arrest the growing trend of the juveniles increasingly getting involved in wrongdoing. A postgraduate in social service and a counsellor, Pathan has received several accolades from the state and national commissions on the children. He spoke to TOI on a wide range of issues pertaining to juvelines.

Excerpts...

Q. What are the possible reasons behind the increase in crimes by juveniles?

A. The social media is playing a major role in diverting the minors to wrongdoings and many of them are ending up brushing the law on the wrong side. There is also a social tendency among minors, especially teenagers, to get anything they want easily, like money, flashy lifestyle, gadgets, eating out, branded clothes and so on. These habits are making them indulge in illegal activities. There should be legal awareness regarding laws and law enforcing agencies. The society, especially parents, should guide minors and apply the brakes when the situation gets out of control.

Q. Are the ills of sex trafficking, child marriages, forced labour, child prostitution and begging increasing?

A. There is an alarming rise in cases of exploitation of minors, be it begging, trafficking or forced labour. Brothel-keepers are encouraging sex trafficking as there is a demand for minors from customers in red-light areas. Begging racketeers are harbouring children as each child is said to be earning 500-600 rupees within a couple of hours at traffic signals. The migrating population also encourages begging by minor members of their family. Minors also mean cheap labour. Only proper implementations of law can correct this situation. In several states with skewed sex ration, the minor girls are being trafficked as brides and are generally traded like commodities which is alarming.

Q. Do you think proper implementation of the law can change the situation and put a brake on the exploitation of minors?

A. There is a district task force in place under deputy commissioner of police (crime) to step up vigilance and take periodic reviews. This task force should crack down on the racketeers, syndicates and individuals engaged in various exploitative activities. There are five stages. The first is preventive awareness followed by rescue action, rehabilitation, re-integration into the mainstream and lastly, re-uniting them with the families.

Q. Do you feel that police stations are doing enough to enforce laws?

A. Every police station should designate an assistant sub-inspector as a ‘Child welfare officer’ who will prepare and send the social investigation report (SIR) of the juveniles to the Juvenile justice board for the corrective measures and rehabilitation. There should be ‘child friendly’ police stations and no stigma should be attached to them after being found indulging in illegal activities. Police should nurture an approach while dealing with laws related to minors in a manner different than that for majors. They should treat minors with sensitivity and care. Chargesheeting and putting minors behind bars is not that important, but counselling and rehabilitation are a must.

Q. What are the lacunas in the enforcement of laws?

A. Laws related to the minors are being half-heartedly implemented or enforced for multiple reasons. The police and the other government departments often face constraints in manpower and budgetary allocations. There is lack of proper training and awareness regarding the provisions in the laws. An officer deals with a case in his or her incumbent posting and then shifts to some other responsibilities in the next posting. The entire effort that goes into training is mostly lost. There are district level committees under the deputy commissioner of police and Addl SP or DySP in rural areas which are tasked with various responsibilities related to laws regarding minors but their efforts need to be spruced up.

Q. How can NGOs help in improving the implementation of laws or act as a supportive mechanism with the enforcing agencies?

A. NGOs can play a big role as support mechanisms aiding government machineries. But they need to be trained, made aware and groomed first. No NGO should start working with minor-related issues without knowledge, training or proper guidance from competent authorities like women and child development (WCD) departments and it’s designated officers. We, at the WCD, are ready to train and groom NGOs in handling minors and laws related to them. Without training, they might end up doing more harm than good.

Q. How can government agencies help in improving the situation?

A. The central government’s integrated child protection scheme should be implemented wholeheartedly. It contains various facets which would improve the support system pertaining to children in every sense. There is already a committee under the high court and district court judges to oversee the implementation of laws related to minors. Departments like education, labour, tribal, women and child development should contribute their share to shield minors and ensure their childhood is not lost. The government should also organize seminars at district, state and national levels and also participate in international meetings on issues of minors and laws related to them.

But by the time the institutes could call off the classes, thousands of students had already landed in their centres. They were immediately requested to go back to their hostels or accommodations and asked not to report until the ban is lifted. The coaching institutes said that they pre-empted the government advisory since the first case of an Italian couple tested positive for the virus in Jaipur last week.By the evening, the coaching majors, which have over 1.5 lakh students from outside Kota, adopted the “minimal human contact-free coaching” methods and shifted their classes to the online platform, offering lessons and giving out assignments through WhatsApp, video conferencing and mobile apps to ensure “no loss of studies”.“All major institutes immediately started working on preparing online modules to be broadcast on social media platforms,” said Pramod Maheshwari, director of Career Point.At present, two groups of students are living in Kota: Those preparing to appear in JEE-Main slated in April and NEET in May; the others are those who are in junior classes and most of them preparing for competitive exams like Olympiads.The initial hours were full of panic as the centres found it difficult to counsel students who were worried about the break in their preparation.

It has fixed parameters to decide how severe the respiratory distress should be for the fixed dose combination to be used on a patient.Similar parameters have been fixed for other possible complications as well, upon which the drug can be used to save the patients.According to ICMR experts, the inclusion of the anti-HIV drugs for treating Covid-19 was based on earlier evidence about their effectiveness against SARS and MERS coronaviruses that led to outbreaks in different parts of the world in 2002-03 and 2012, respectively, as well as the docking studies conducted by National Institute of Virology , Pune.“Use of IFN-B1b (a drug used for treating multiple sclerosis) and Ribavarin (an antiviral medication used to treat certain respiratory infections, hepatitis C and some viral haemorrhagic fevers) was not considered due to their reported toxicity whereas Oseltamivir (used to treat swine flu) was not considered due to its unproven efficacy against CoVs (coronaviruses),” states the treatment protocol published in Indian Journal of Medical Research (IJMR). The fixed dose drug combination (Lopinavir/Ritonavir 200 mg/50 mg) is to be given two tablets every 12 hours for 14 days or for seven days after becoming symptomatic, whichever is earlier, as per the protocol.The anti-HIV drugs have been tried on some Covid-19 patients in India already, including the Italian national admitted at Sawai Man Singh hospital in Jaipur, with promising results, said sources.Recently, in a draft report made public by World Health Organisation , the experts claimed Lopinavir and Ritonavir — either alone or in combination with IFNbeta was the suitable second option for rapid implementation in clinical trials among the repurposed drugs under consideration for Covid-19.WHO experts claimed that Remdesivir, a drug developed for use against Ebola, is most promising for treating Covid-19.“This is because the in-vitro (tests performed in test tube) and in-vivo (tests performed in living organism) data for the drug are available for coronaviruses.”“Further, studies in mice using Remdesivir showed superior efficacy over Kaletra+IFNbeta,” they stated in the draft report.

363,['15/03/2020'],West Bengal: State election commission mulls ballot for civic elections,"Representative Image

KOLKATA: The state election commission (SEC) is likely to prefer ballots over electronic voting machines (EVM) for the civic polls this year. The SEC officials will hold a meeting with political parties on Monday to finalize the dates of the civic polls, which had earlier been planned for mid-April, and decide on using ballots for voting.

EVMs are more prone to be a causative agent in spreading the disease, an SEC official said and pointed out that the Centre has banned biometric attendance systems as it can spread the disease. “So ballot is the only option now,” the official said. He added that they will convey this to Nabanna as the state government has to be kept in the loop.

Due to the Covid-19 outbreak, poll dates may be pushed back to the end of May after Ramzan. SEC officials are worried about how the campaigns will be conducted and if political parties can be allowed to hold rallies as the Centre’s health advisory has strictly prohibited public gatherings. The SEC will consult the political parties before finalizing the dates over the use of ballots because even if polls are held mid-April, queues of the voters cannot be avoided.

Trinamool has reportedly lobbied with SEC for holding the civic polls using ballots instead of EVM. Even Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had expressed doubts over EVMs and had urged the election commission to roll back to the old ballot system.

However, state BJP president Dilip Ghosh objected to the ballot system. “I don’t see any problem in holding polls using EVMs. Polling personnel have been trained on EVMs already. If ballot is used, it will only help the ruling party and its goons. Thus, people will be deprived of their democratic rights,” the BJP MP said.

The data showed that the maximum number of accidents were reported in Jaipur rural, followed by Udaipur and Alwar. A total of 23,480 accidents were reported in 2019.

Out of the total accidents, the maximum were in Jaipur rural with 1,224 incidents reported, followed by Udaipur with 1,218 accidents, and Alwar with 1,212 accidents. Apart from these districts, Ajmer also had a high number with 1,174 accidents being reported in 2019.

“While the percentage of the number of accidents has increased overall, there are a few districts which have seen this figure go down in 2019 as compared to 2018. These include Udaipur, which saw a decline by two per cent in the accidents, as well as Bundi which had 10 per cent fewer accidents, and others.

The PM’s assurance came when a delegation of the newly-floated J&K Apni Party, led by former PDP member Altaf Bukhari , met him on Saturday evening.

366,['15/03/2020'],Cops behaving like YSRC men: Naidu,"Vijayawada: TDP chief and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Saturday accused the police personnel of behaving like ruling party activists and forcing candidates from other parties to withdraw their nominations.

“Police terrorism is prevailing in the state. AP police are behaving like YSRC activists and subjecting TDP workers to physical and psychological torture. The police are harassing opposition candidates by threatening to file false cases. It’s nothing but murder of democracy,” Naidu alleged.

He also termed the ordinance brought in by the state government, that enables disqualification of a candidate and three years in jail for election code violation, as “black law”. Recalling the incidents in Tenali, Repalle, Chilakaluripet and Kalahasti, he said ruling party members are trying to implicate opposition candidates by planting liquor bottles in their homes. “False cases are being filed in the garb of ordinance so that opposition candidates are forced to withdraw their nominations,” he said.

Naidu also took objection to DGP Gautam Sawang’s statement on law and order situation in the state.

“If law and order situation is under control, the DGP should explain how and why the Macherla, Tenali and other incidents took place. Governments come and go but public servants should work for the people instead of working for the ruling dispensation,” he said.

Meanwhile, reacting to the allegations, municipal administration minister Botcha Satyanarayana challenged Naidu to come out with proof instead of making false and baseless claims.

“Only Naidu and Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan are making such allegations. The elections are being conducted in the most peaceful manner. Naidu is getting frustrated because he knows his party will face another crushing defeat in both the local body and civic polls,” he said in Vizianagaram.

367,['15/03/2020'],Faulty roads main cause of deaths due to mishaps,"Jodhpur: Faulty road construction and negligence in addressing vital aspects of safety have contributed to fatalities due to road accidents in the state.

Twenty four passengers had lost their lives when their bus fell into a river in Bundi last month. In Jodhpur, six passengers were killed last Sunday when their bus collided with a truck at a road diversion due to a bridge construction.

On Saturday, 11 people were killed in an accident at Shergarh’s Sointara village in Jodhpur.

SP (Jodhpur rural) Rahul Barhat, who rushed to the accident spot after the collision of a truck and a Bolero on Saturday morning, examined the spot and found faults leading to the accident.

“The stretch has two lanes, turns and slops because of which the drivers of the vehicles find it difficult to spot the vehicle coming from opposite direction,” said Barhat.

He said that the police would take up the issue with the road construction agency RIDCOR in the next two to three days to address this fault.

A recent report by the CAG has also found some glaring irregularities in road construction in the state. The report categorically stated that roads were constructed at the recommendations of the ministers where they were not required at all and neglected altogether where they were actually required.

The report also stated that rules were compromised and quality was miserably overlooked in construction of the roads worth Rs 123 crore.

A police officer said that there are some grey spots on roads which have constantly been brought to the notice of the authorities but in vain.

Recently, a passenger bus, fortunately empty, had fallen into a parched river from a bridge in Banar area on Jodhpur-Jaipur highway as the bridge was barely a two-lane structure on a four-lane road and that too with vertical and broken barriers.

Hundreds of candidates, along with supporters, waited outside offices of returning officers (RO) till late in the night. Handling a huge number of applications became a problem for civic officials and staff from zonal offices helped returning officers consolidate the lists of nominations.

YSRC candidates from 64 wards filed around 244 nominations in the city, followed by Telugu Desam Party with 171 nominations. Jana Sena and BJP together filed around 152 nominations.

VMC authorities started the scrutiny process on Saturday. Officials were verifying every document submitted by candidates and updating information.

Meanwhile, all major political parties are now grappling with rebel candidates. Around 15 candidates from Jana Sena filed nominations as rebel candidates and the party high command is continuing talks to convince them to withdraw their nominations.

A war of words between Telugu Desam and YSRC continued on Saturday. Former irrigation minister Devineni Umamaheswara Rao targeted endowments minister Vellampalli Srinivasa Rao. “The election process is not fair and transparent. YSRC is threatening our candidates and insisting that they withdraw nominations. Police were filing false cases against our cadre. We hope Vellampalli Srinivas will lose ministry after the disastrous defeat of YSRC in local polls,” Devineni Uma said.

The YSRC carrying out door-to-door campaigns and targeting TDP in meetings conducted at the ward level. “Telugu Desam ignored the welfare of Vijayawada during their tenure. They are trying to gain votes by spreading false news on capital shifting. Our rebels will soon withdraw nominations,” MLA Malladi Vishnuvardhan said.

Even as the nomination process for municipal elections concluded on Friday, political parties are intensifying campaigning. Local issues will play a major role in local body elections, with people demanding that candidates promise to complete long-pending projects.

The ruling YSRC which won 19 out of 59 divisions and emerged the principal opposition party in 2014 municipal elections, is now focused on winning a majority of the seats. YSRC candidates who contested all 64 divisions are publicizing ‘Navaratnalu’ and other welfare schemes implemented in the last nine months. Legislator Malladi Vishnuvardhan and minister Vellampalli Srinivas are making efforts to record a land slide victory in municipal elections.

“Development activity done by our government in the last nine months will help us achieve a sweeping victory. People were happy with our development works. We have started key projects such as Gunadala Flyover, 24 hours drinking water supply and others in the city,” said Malladi Vishnuvardhan.

TDP which emerged victorious in the 2014 elections is requesting the public to give it a chance again to complete pending projects. “We have completed long-pending projects such as Christurajapuram road, underground drainage, stormwater drains and others.,” said Gogula Ramana Rao, former deputy mayor.

370,['15/03/2020'],Traffic stalls as torrential rain and hail hit Delhi,"A view of Kashmere Gate after rains on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: The city and its civic agencies were caught off guard on Saturday when a hailstorm and heavy non-seasonal rains lashed Delhi, leading to massive water logging in the south, east and west. There was large-scale traffic disruption in almost all areas of the capital.

The rain, accompanied by heavy winds, brought about a quick fall in temperature, but the citizens could not enjoy the cool weather. With torrential rain accompanied by hailstones, the roads soon became flooded, leaving street users haplessly caught in intractable traffic in the evening rush hour, worsened by it being a weekend.

According to information provided by Delhi traffic police, movement of traffic was disrupted on numerous traffic intersections and flyovers, including Ring Road near the World Health Organization building close to ITO, Vikas Marg, Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium, Indraprastha flyover, the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium crossing, Lodhi Colony flyover, Rao Tula Ram Marg near Munirka , Moolchand underpass and the AIIMS intersection.

At AIIMS, water had collected several feet high nears the loops of the flyover there, trapping many two wheelers and autorickshaws. An exasperated Pallav Jain, a commuter stalled at the inundated portion there, grumbled that the spell of rain had again exposed the lack of preparedness of Delhi’s civic agencies. “If a short downpour can lead to such a breakdown in road traffic, one can only imagine what lies ahead in the monsoon season,” he snapped.

At the Ashram intersection, already burdened by the rerouting of traffic from the Shaheen Bagh road and the construction of an underpass, traffic came to a grinding halt after the area was flooded. Long lines of impatient drivers idled as vehicles made heavy weather of going past the busy chowk.

Commuters were forewarned by traffic authorities about gridlocks at Pipal Chowk, Mangal Bazar Road, Sangam Vihar, Barf Khana Chowk and Malkaganj in north Delhi. Multiple points in east Delhi such as Bihari Colony, Kanti Nagar , Gandhi Nagar, Pandav Nagar, Khoda Chowk , Mayur Vihar Phase III and Dallupura-Kondli Road similarly inconvenienced people.

Police also received many complaints from the underpasses on NH-24. An irate Rajeev Solanki was indignant at the underpasses filling up with water. “This is now a regular phenomenon,” he raged. “A light drizzle is enough to turn the underpasses into swimming pools. And what is more, the water is never pumped out for days.”

Reports of crawling traffic were also received from many other areas of the city. Despite the reality showing otherwise on Saturday, south corporation officials had claimed zero water logging in the monsoon report from all its four zones. The PWD did not respond to TOI’s queries about the state of its roads.

A north civic body official argued that the annual de-silting of drains hadn’t yet begun and regular maintenance of vulnerable points would be carried out through the year. “We will install pumps in problem areas and our staff is at the flooded spots,” the official claimed.

Citing the several violent incidents reported across the state in the run-up to the polls, it said elections can’t be conducted in a free and fair manner in the state under the prevailing circumstances.

“Even women from SC and ST communities were obstructed, threatened and not allowed to file nominations by ruling party workers. The government, which claims to be women-friendly, should go for re-notification and give a chance to all those women who could not file their nominations,” TDP’s official spokesperson P Anuradha said on Saturday.

Hitting back, YSRC MLA Kasu Mahesh Reddy said opposition leader N Chandrababu Naidu has been spreading lies about local body polls. “There is no truth in the allegations of not allowing opposition candidates from filing nominations. More than 19,000 nominations have been filed by TDP candidates which shows that the situation is normal and elections are being held peacefully,” he said.

The TDP has lost the confidence of people and Naidu has become desperate after losing power, he added. “Unlike Naidu who turned the secretariat into TDP’s party office, chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy has been working for the all round development of the state by taking all sections of the society into confidence irrespective of their political affiliations,” he said.

Despite fights that lasted several years, authorities of VMC failed to shift the dumping yard completely from the area. The bio-mining of solid waste project, which started in 2019, is proceeding at a slow pace. The YSRC government has proposed to construct a park in the dumping yard soon.

“We have bee living next to heaps of garbage for years. Officials cleared around 80 per cent of the garbage, but they are again dumping garbage in the name of the transfer station. We have decided to vote for the party which gives us an assurance that it will resolve the issues,” said K Bhagya Rani, a resident of Vambey colony.

Locals are seriously objecting to the composting unit established there as it makes the whole area stink. “Composting of wet waste is a very good initiative, but it is causing a stink. Officials should shift these units to the outskirts of the city,” a resident said.

A few roads in the colonies surrounding Ajith Singh Nagar, such as Kandrika, are in poor shape and locals are demanding an assurance from political parties to improve infrastructure. “A major portion of Ajith Singh Nagar is occupied by poor people and people from middle-class backgrounds. They are demanding minimum infrastructure like pure drinking water, block-free drains and proper sanitation,” said K Nazeer, a carpenter residing in Luna center.

Political parties have intensified their campaigns in Ajith Singh Nagar and have promised to resolve the long-pending issues.

379,['15/03/2020'],MLA seeks funds from state for sports facilities,"Kolhapur: MLA from Kolhapur South constituency Ruturaj Patil has sought funds from the state government to develop sports facilities at Kasba Bawda’s Pavilion ground.

The venue is one of the biggest grounds in the city. Currently, tennis ball cricket tournaments are organised at the ground, which also has a walking track along with a garden and an open gym.

Patil in his letter to state sports and youth welfare minister Sunil Kedar has asked for funds to develop a boxing ring, swimming pool and a spectator gallery in the premises.

“Kasba Bawada is one of the rapidly growing city suburbs. The indoor badminton and gym facility has been developed at the old building. Through private participation, the levelling of the ground and maintenance has been taken care. Due to increasing demand from the locals, I have requested the minister to develop more sports facilities,” said Patil.

In the last couple of years, over Rs 60 lakhs have been spent on installing lights, repairing stormwater drain, a hall for handicapped players, changing rooms, parking facility, and compound wall.

The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) is also planning to remove the encroachments surrounding the ground. The KMC has decided to develop another ground at Sagarmal for which budgetary provision has been made.

Patil maintained that during the cricket tournaments, the huge crowd turns up for the matches. The locals have to face inconvenience owing to the abrupt parking of the visitor vehicles.

The entry to the ground will be limited as separate parking spaces will be allocated for the visitors.

“The sanitation issues are also being addressed. Separate channels are developed to drain out the wastewater from entering the ground,” added Patil.

Actor, anchor and director Nilesh Sable came out with a video blog on Saturday where he said, “We respect all the historical figures. Morphing the photos of the legendary kings was a technical mistake for which we apologise.”

Rajya Sabha MP Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati, a descendant of Shahu Maharaj, had slammed the use of the photos of the kings, who were also social reformers. He said using photos of historical figures to create humour did not qualify for freedom of expression.

“My family has always remained an avid supporter of arts. Shahu Maharaj had transformed Kolhapur into a buzzing town of arts and movies. There is lot of freedom given to us. However, hurting people’s sentiments this way is not permissible. Followers of Shahu Maharaj will not tolerate such acts,” said Sambhajiraje.

Addressing the convocation ceremony of a private university in the city on Saturday, Goa governor Malik said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done a lot for Kashmiri Pandits. While 6,000 houses have been constructed, more land has been earmarked for their rehabilitation. They will have to decide whether to live in Delhi or return to their native place.”

NEW DELHI: Terming as “excessive” a lifelong ban on driving imposed on a man for rash driving that led to the death of a minor , Delhi high court has modified the punishment.

Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva said that cancellation of the driving licence of the man for all classes or description of vehicles is excessive and noted that he is a driver by profession.

The court said that the “punishment of cancellation of the driving licence permanently and debarring him from obtaining any driving licence throughout his life literally amounts to his civil death, because he would not be in a position to carry out his profession for life.”

Partially lifting the stay, the court modified the ban to the extent that his driving licence remained “cancelled for the class and description of medium and heavy goods and medium and heavy passenger vehicles and he is debarred from obtaining a driving licence for medium and heavy goods and medium and heavy passenger vehicles. For obtaining a driving licence of other description of vehicles, he shall have to undergo a fresh test of competence to drive.”

The accused, Sunil Mishra, had moved the court through his lawyer Pramod Dubey, arguing that since he has already served the 12 months in jail punishment imposed by the trial court, the ban on his driving be lifted.

Mishra was held guilty by the trial court that cancelled his driving licence and debarred him from obtaining any licence throughout his life and directed that no fresh driving licence shall be issued to him. It directed the transport authorities to circulate the order to all registration authorities across the country.

As per the prosecution, Mishra rashly drove a trailer, crushing to death a nine-year-old boy on August 31, 2000 in front of DAV school in Samaypur Badli.

The victim, Naveen Kumar, was hit from behind, causing his death as he walked to school with his father. The driver had claimed in his appeal that the prosecution had failed to prove by which vehicle the accident was caused and as the place of incident was a crowded area near a school, the vehicle could not have been driven at a high speed.

But the court convicted Mishra and jailed him for one year for causing the death of the school-going child by negligence.

“In such a case where the complainant (father) himself suffered such a trauma, in which his life was luckily saved and he had witnessed the accident in which his minor son, who was in his company at the time of accident, had died in such a bitter and miserable condition, truthfulness of the witness and his credibility cannot be disbelieved, just for the reason that he was the father,” the court said.

The import delay has also pushed the prices of the fibres up by around 15-20%. Similarly, the prices of cotton-based products have also nosedived as its export has almost ceased. According to local traders, the industry was already in crisis due to demonetisation and introduction of GST, and coronavirus has worsened their prospects.Nehtaur in the district has its place in the annals of history for hand-woven products like shawls, scarves and bedsheets that are exported to various European countries and the US. The estimates of the textile association suggest that the annual turnover of the industry in Nahtaur alone was over 250 crore, of which exports were to the tune of Rs 50crore till recently. Sources said that the recent slump has now reduced the industry’s total turnover to around Rs 50 crore.There are over 125 units in Nahtaur and its surrounding villages including Seda, Basera and Garhi, on which over 15,000 workers are dependent for livelihood.Talking to TOI, Maksood Ahmed, president of weavers’ association, said, “Coronavirus has spread across the world. Markets have crashed. Imports and exports have come to a standstill. We make shawls, scarves and the like. Around 50% of these products used to be exported to the US, Europe and gulf countries through agents. However, there is now uncertainty over the market because of the infection. We have deferred all our travel for business-related purposes.”Elaborating on weavers’ grievances, another Nahtaur-based handloom unit owner Nadeem Ahmed said, “Earlier, our business was affected by demonetisation. Then it was GST. Apart from these, government had reduced the subsidy on electricity too resulting in a rise of the cost of production. We somehow braved all these, but coronavirus has now crippled our business.”“We used to import rayon thread from China to make scarves and shawls which has now stopped resulting in a rise in prices by 15 to 20%. There is little prospect of exporting our products abroad. Domestic markets have also dwindled. The business has come down by around 60 to 70%. Even the export of cotton products have stopped.

With a heating system being installed, metro passengers will also get a “warm welcome” when they board the trains next winter.The trains deployed in the older corridors – Red (Rithala-Shaheed Sthal New Bus Adda), Yellow (Samaypur Badli-HUDA City Centre) and Blue (Dwarka-Vaishali/Noida City Centre) – have old air-conditioning systems. These ensure a cool ride in summers, but get uncomfortable when the mercury drops in winters. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is now going to upgrade these old trains with a new heating system.“The air-conditioning system of all 280 coaches procured initially under Phase-I corridors of Red, Blue and Yellow lines had the mechanism of cooling the coaches to keep temperature in the range of 19-25 degrees Celsius. However, they did not have the mechanism to heat the trains in extreme winters,” a DMRC spokesperson said.“Once the ACs are equipped with the heating system, the coaches will provide a pleasant temperature range of 19-25 degrees in winters too,” he added.Apart from the heating system, DMRC is upgrading its old train coaches with many new features that are available in the state-of-the-art trains deployed in newer corridors such as Pink (Shiv Vihar-Majlis Park) and Magenta (Botanical Garden-Janakpuri West) lines.The trains on Pink and Magenta lines have a provision to adjust the intensity of light inside the coaches according to the sunlight. This mechanism will be provided in the older trains too. “At night time, all lights inside the trains will provide uniform illumination,” said the spokesperson.DMRC is, meanwhile, planning to reduce electric energy consumption by increased utilisation of natural light. The units are first being installed in trains in Violet (Kashmre Gate-Raja Nahar Singh) and Green lines (Inderlok-Brig. Hoshiar Singh) in a phased manner, and depending on the feasibility, these can be installed in Red, Blue and Yellow line trains in the future.Older trains are also getting enhanced smoke detection mechanism. As of now, the smoke detection facility is available only in the first and the last coach. In case of any smoke, it gets activated and ensures no smoke enters into coaches, the spokesperson said.“However, there is a remote possibility that the mechanism may malfunction and smoke gets entry inside other coaches. To ward off such a possibility, DMRC is now introducing a manual provision in which Train Operator himself can activate it as soon as he notices any smoke during train movement,” he said. “This will ensure that no smoke spreads even if the auto-sensor malfunctions,” he added.DMRC is installing a better mechanism for opening and closing of doors as well.Apart from these features, DMRC is carrying out an exercise of refurbishing old trains, which will include retrofitting of gangways, the partition between two coaches. This part of a train sees the most damage. New floors and freshly painted coachesemail are also on the cards.

KOLHAPUR: The anti-human trafficking department of the Kolhapur police has succeeded in tracking down 17 missing girls in 2019.

The police said almost all these girls had eloped — after falling in love or due to some affection.

The department keeps checking if there is any kidnap of trafficking angle to the missing cases. Last week, the department had circulated a note in the local newspapers mentioning the details of five missing girls and had requested the citizens for any available information.

Sarojini Chavan, the assistant police inspector attached with anti-human trafficking department, said, “As per government rules, once the parents complain about their child — boy or girl — going missing, the police register a case of kidnapping. The police station concerned launches a search operation with the help of other agencies across the country and trace the child. If they fail, then the case is transferred to our wing.”

“In 2019, our department was handed over 33 missing cases and we have successfully traced 17 missing girls and handed over them to their parents. Almost all of them had eloped with someone after falling in love or other similar reasons,” she said.

“We have issued a notice with details of five other girls who have are missing since 2018, and we are yet trace them. The aim of publishing details with photos is to get clues regarding the girls’ whereabouts,” she said. “Generally, the photographs and details of missing girls are published in newspapers only after taking consent from their parents. If the parents do not give consent, we do not publish the photos,” she added.

According to the department, out of 33 missing girls in 2019, the department is yet to trace 16 girls. The department had traced 13 missing girls in 2018 and 15 in 2017 as same number of cases were transferred to the department during that period.

NEW DELHI: Citing the slump in global oil prices, AAP national spokesperson and Rajendra Nagar MLA Raghav Chadha on Saturday demanded PM Narendra Modi-led central government to give its “full benefit” to the consumers and immediately reduce the prices of petrol and diesel across the country.

Chadha said the price of petrol should be reduced to Rs 39.76 per litre, while diesel should be available at Rs 31.58per litre. He claimed that the BJP-led government at the Centre had increased the excise duty nearly 12 times resulting in the exponential hike in oil prices.

“The price of aviation fuel today is cheaper than that of the per litre price of petrol and diesel. Flying an aeroplane is cheaper than driving a car today,” Chadha said, adding that the excise duty on fuel had again been increased by Rs 3 per litre.

The AAP functionary said that when the unemployment rate has touched a record high and the economy was witnessing an unprecedented slowdown, the Modi government has again increased the fuel prices and inflation rate.

The Rajendra Nagar MLA added that the excise duty on diesel in May 2014, when BJP formed the government, was Rs 3.56 per litre, which has now increased to Rs 18.80/litre and the petrol price has jumped from Rs 9.40 per litre to Rs 22.90 per litre. The Centre had collected Rs 16 lakh crore by increasing the excuse duty, which should be returned to the consumers in form of cheaper fuel, he said.

Delhi BJP refused to comment on Chadha’s statement.

On Islamabad agreeing to the proposal, official sources said India is happy to take Pakistan along for an exercise whose sole purpose is to prevent the deadly virus from affecting the lives of people of the region. They warned that it shouldn’t be seen as opening a door for revival of the Saarc summit process.The government has already announced though that it will invite Khan for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit which will be held in India later this year. “The initiative is important as it underscores the significance of regional cooperation in fighting coronavirus at a time when many countries are thinking of closing their borders,’’ said a source.“I would like to propose that the leadership of Saarc nations chalk out a strong strategy to fight coronavirus,” Modi tweeted on Friday. “We could discuss, via video conferencing, ways to keep our citizens healthy.

On Saturday, Bandhan Bank and Federal Bank committed Rs 300 crore each to Yes Bank equity joining the ranks of four other lenders and taking the total tally to Rs 10,950 crore.

A government gazette notification later on Friday paved the way for a reconstructed Yes Bank with capital from other lenders and three government appointees on the board. It also placed barred existing investors holding above 100 shares from selling them for three years. Another notification exempted SBI from holding up to 30%.

Lenders who have so far committed equity funds in addition to SBI’s Rs 7250 crore include HDFC (Rs 1000 crore), ICICI Bank (Rs 1000 crore), Axis Bank (Rs 600 crore), Kotak Bank (Rs 500 crore), Bandhan Bank (Rs 300 crore) and Federal Bank (Rs 300 crore).

“It was a joint decision by SBI and others to contribute. We are an integral part of the financial system and we must support other banks that have gone into difficulty. The difficulty may be due to any reason but there are a large number of depositors, borrowers, and employees. We are reasonably confident that the bank will be revived,” said HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh.

Yes Bank, which was to announce its results on Saturday, said the announcement was delayed. The bank is expected to announce huge provisioning for bad loans which will erode its capital. Till the filing of this report, however, the bank had not yet released its financial results to the exchanges.

The notification said that existing shares held by existing investors who hold over 100 shares will be subject to a three-year lock-in. Prashant Kumar, former SBI deputy MD, who is currently the administrator of the bank, will take charge as CEO.

The three members nominated by the government to the bank’s board are Sunil Mehta , former chairman Punjab National Bank and Atul Bheda.

398,['15/03/2020'],Fix filing issues by July: GST panel to Infosys,"NEW DELHI: The GST Council on Saturday moved in with fresh checks, including getting information from banks, to plug evasion, while deciding to instruct Infosys to fix technical glitches to the filing system by July.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the Centre will explore the possibility of raising money from the markets to help generate funds for states that have been complaining of shortfall in compensation as several of them have seen less than 14% growth in collections.

A key theme of the meeting was to get Infosys to fix the filing problems that are being encountered by taxpayers for several months. With company executives failing to resolve the issue, the Council took the unprecedented step of asking the software company’s chairman and co-founder Nandan Nilekani to make a presentation, where he was asked to explain what triggers the problems. Sitharaman said the proposal given by Nilekani focused on incremental transition to a better system and additional requirement for hardware, but suggested that the entire process could only be completed by next January, partly due to some supply constraints on account of coronavirus.

The Council is, however, going to ask Infosys to complete the process by July so that the peak load can be enhanced to three lakh users compared to 1.5 lakh at present and more skilled manpower is deployed by the company. Besides, Nilekani would be asked to be personally present at the next three GST Council meetings and make presentation on the progress. The FM said Infosys and Tech Mahindra which handles complaints and generation of ticket number are being asked to coordinate better to ensure that there is no hardship to taxpayers and the government does not have to step in.

A number of new measures such as e-invoice, QR Codes and e-wallet scheme were also deferred along with giving an extended deadline for filing of annual returns by small tax-payers. At its meeting on Saturday, the Council also decided to seek information returns from banks, on the lines of the income tax department, while mandating physical verification and financial KYC of those registering for GST so that tax credits can be released. A number of cases of fake invoices and fly-by-night operators have emerged where taxpayers vanish after claiming refunds.

A new feature of ‘know-your-supplier’ is also being introduced for taxpayers so that a buyer will not only get the PAN and GST numbers and address of the supplier but also get to know if it has been filing returns.

399,['15/03/2020'],Candidates woo voters in gated communities,"Visakhapatnam: With less than 10 days left for local body elections , candidates of various wards have turned their attention to apartment complexes and gated communities where they can meet voters in large numbers. Between 20 to 25 per cent of the city’s population resides in these complexes.

In Visakha East, North, West, Bheemili and parts of Gajuwaka assembly constituencies, where there a large number of gated communities, candidates of all parties are focusing on apartment residential welfare associations.

The highest number of apartment complexes is in Seetammadhara, Balayyasastry Layout, HB Colony, Muralinagar and Madhavadhara in Visakha North, Waltair, Lawson’s Bay Colony, Kirlapudi Layout and MVP Colony in Visakha East, Madhurawada, Yendada, PM Palem and Kommadi, and Sagarnagar in Bheemili.

According to sources in the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC), one lakh of the 5.8 lakh households under the civic body’s limits reside in these apartment complexes. The city has a population of nearly 25 lakh. Of the four wards under Bheemili that were merged with GVMC, two have several households residing in apartment complexes.

“We have very less time for campaign. Where do we meet voters in large numbers? We have good chances at rythu bazaars, shandies and apartments. In each apartment, we can meet a minimum of 50 voters. If the apartment is big then the number will be more than 100,” said a candidate from Visakha North.

“Candidates have already started their campaign by calling us and requesting meetings. Some of the apartment welfare associations have already put forth their demands before the candidates. The demands of the residents are proper roads and better sanitation, besides proper drinking water supply in summer,” said MS Rao, president of a welfare association at an apartment in Madhurawada.

400,['15/03/2020'],GVMC elections: What’s at stake?,"Visakhapatnam: At a time when the city is caught up in election fever, the nagging civic issues of Visakhapatnam have once again come to the fore. Visakhapatnam, the city, has been battling air pollution for a long time now. The air quality here is significantly poor owing to the presence of heavy industries being located at the heart of the city and coal dust emanating from the port.

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has identified Visakhapatnam as a non-attainment city— which is to say that the city does not meet the national ambient air quality standards prescribed. While an action plan is being formulated under the national clean air programme, what the plan will achieve is anyone’s guess.

On the other hand, the sharp increase in the number of vehicles points to the need creating more parking spaces, constructing flyovers, expanding the road network, making sure that designated parking spaces is used only for parking. Unfortunately, there is no dedicated public parking lot in the city.

The GVMC is developing a small multi-level car parking facility under the smart city project. The project is supposed to be completed by May. VMRDA’s multi-level car parking facility proposal is yet to make headway.

Additionally, the ever-widening gap between the demand and supply of water with growing population and industrial expansion is making life difficult. With raw water sources dependent on monsoon, the water supply mechanism in low-supply areas is under immense pressure.

The poor water supply network, suffering several leakages is adding to the problems of the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC). The duration of water supply in households decreases in summer. Industries are forced to operate at low capacity due to the shortage.

In a bid to find a solution to this, the state government is planning to bring water from Polavaram by laying a direct pipeline. But the project is extremely expensive and might cost the exchequer around Rs 2,000 crore.

There are 21 drains that release sewage into the sea— from the fishing harbour to Tenneti Park. While wastewater from 8 drains is treated before being discharged, the wastewater from the other 13 are either partially treated or not treated at all. This is wreaking havoc on the marine life around the city.

Visakhapatnam: While Visakhapatnam has been making rapid strides towards becoming a futuristic smart city, perhaps even the executive capital, its fruits of growth have still not reached some colonies in the city, particularly One Town area.

For a residential area that sprang up more than a century ago, the area hasn’t changed much infrastructurally or economically, particularly after the central business district started shifting towards the north about three to four decades ago. Right from pollution becoming a perennial problem of the area and narrow lanes to decayed drainage system and water supply system, the area presents a grim picture contrary to other parts of the city.

The wind direction also makes the matter worse with it spreading the coal dust from the port area to the residential areas of the city. Thousands of people in One Town area and surroundings have been suffering from various respiratory issues due to the same.

Speaking to TOI, Yuva Bharat Force president Mohammed Sadiq, a local, said: “The ongoing electoral battle to capture the city mayor’s post may witness some high-stake contests in some wards of the GVMC. But One Town area has remained the same for the last three to four decades due to the neglect of successive governments and GVMC councils. Unfortunately, the long proposed 100-feet road from the Jagadamba Junction to the Queen Victoria statue has not made any headway. Even the proposal notifying the area as heritage zone has turned an empty promise,” said Sadiq.

Sadiq gave a long list of civic issues plaguing the area – lack of greenery, coal dust pollution, underground drainage system being limited to only a few parts, rainwater stagnation around the municipal stadium, the age-old water pipelines, drain water frequently spilling onto the road, etc.

“The locals have to pay extra premium, if they want to avail health or general insurance, as the area is listed as hazardous due to the coal dust exposure and pollution. The new GVMC mayor should focus on these issues to revive the past glory of the area,” said Sadiq, who is into port-related work.

Mahesh Krishna, a local businessman complained about shrinking road width in the colonies due to constructions occupying the area due to the alleged apathy of the GVMC town planning wing. “The road width has drastically declined, to as much as 10 feet in some colonies due to the same,” said Krishna.

Dasari Priyanka, a research scholar at Andhra University and a local, said that the drainages laid decades ago in the area have decayed and narrowed down. “The area needs an immediate facelift. I hope at least the next GVMC council would focus on the issue,” said Priyanka.

407,['15/03/2020'],Mobile prices set to rise as GST up 6%,"NEW DELHI: The GST Council on Saturday announced an increase in the levy on mobile phones to 18% from 12%, although the government said it may not result in a proportionate increase in prices.

The hike was aimed at correcting a situation where inputs face higher levies than the final product, resulting in problems and delays in refunds.

Apart from mobile phones, footwear, fertilisers and textiles too were among the list of items with “inverted duty structure”, but after detailed deliberations, the panel comprising Union and state finance ministers decided to move ahead with an increase in the levy on handsets and some specific parts, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters after the meeting. Correcting the rate structure for the other products will be taken up later, the minister added.

“The mobile manufacturers will do the calculations but it is not simple maths of a 6% increase... Because of the inverted duty structure, capital was also getting blocked and the cost was being recovered from consumers,” finance secretary ABP Pandey said when asked about the extent of increase in mobile prices.

The Council also decided to rework the GST structure for maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services for aircraft and slashed the tax from 18% to 5%, along with providing the benefit of full tax credit on inputs.

In addition, taxation will be based on the principle of location of the service provider. “This change is likely to assist in setting up of MROs in India,” Sitharaman said, adding that the domestic players will also get protection under the Customs Act on most of the imported goods.

A third change was the rationalisation of rates on matches. Instead of a 5% levy on handmade match sticks and 18% on machine-made, a flat GST of 12% will now be applicable to both the categories after Tamil Nadu and Puducherry decided to arrive at a consensus that was so far elusive.

The new rates will be applicable from April this year.

North Karnataka is one of the regions that has reaped rich rewards of RCS, and Hubballi Airport has played a crucial role in serving as a transit point for speedy travel to and from the region. The award, instituted by the Union ministry of civil aviation along with the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and the Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), is in recognition for the quality of service that Hubballi Airport has offered for its many passengers.

Under the ‘Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik ( udan )’ scheme, flights, at affordable prices, are being operated from Hubballi by Air India, Indigo and Star Air. In the past two years, the number of flights to and from Hubballi has been steadily climbing. Most of these flights connect Hubballi-Dharwad with other urban centres such as Bengaluru, Mumbai, Hindon (New Delhi) and Goa. Stakeholders affirm that improved connectivity has had a perceptibly positive influence on the industrial sector.

Hubballi Airport director Pramod Kumar Thakare is understandably jubilant with the award for the terminal. “It is very satisfying that our hard work has yielded results. AAI lays down specific criteria, and performance of airports is assessed based on these. Airports must have good infrastructure, amenities for passengers and other key facilities,” Thakare told STOI.

Hubballi Airport pipped 57 other terminals that were vying for the honour, he added. “Operations at our airport have been expanding with each passing year. Hubballi Airport registered a growth in traffic of 500% in 2018-19 compared to 2017-18, whereas transport of passengers rose by 800% in the same period. In 2019-20, that is up to January, we have serviced 4.2 lakh passengers, which is an improvement on our figures of last year,” Thakare added.

He said that Indigo would commence operations of two more flights from Hubballi, to Mumbai and Bengaluru starting March 29. “We are confident that more airlines will start to operate more flights in the days to come from hubballi,” the airport director said.

409,['15/03/2020'],"Young lawyers must practise in lower courts, gain experience, says SC judge","Dharwad: Supreme Court judge Justice Mohan Shantanagoudar called upon budding lawyers to practice in lower courts to gain experience as these courts open up opportunities galore to learn about the intricacies of procedural law.

Delivering the address at the fourth annual convocation of Karnataka State Law University here on Saturday, he said the trend among fresh lawyers is to be attracted to law firms which they consider lucrative. Those who opt for litigation prefer to practice at appellate court-level as a result of which the trial courts have become the Cinderella of judiciary, he said.

Notwithstanding the aversion of young law students to a career in the trial courts either as a lawyer or a judicial officer, trial court litigation continues to boom. Since competent persons do not join trial court practice, the pool for elevation to the Bench is also limited. The respect that the decision of a trial court should command also gets compromised. At the same time errors and miscarriages of justice committed by lower courts increases the burden for the appellate courts, he observed.

Justice Shanatangoudar reasoned that the law though a difficult creature to tame is not that hard to acquire knowledge of. If the trial court has not made a finding in one’s favour on facts, one’s cause is lost at the outset. Therefore the trial court’s judgment forms the cornerstone of the entire case and without good argumentation and adjudication at the trial court level any appeal will be a meaningless endeavour, he noted.

Justice Shantanagoudar advised fresh lawyers to be careful and to maintain dignity and propriety in their interaction with the Bench and their fellow members of the Bar. Trying to bribe or undertake ‘settlements’ with the other side without the client’s knowledge, making misrepresentations to clients are all practices which should be frowned upon, he said.

Law minister J C Madhuswamy who is the pro-chancellor of KSLU presided. Vice chancellor Ishwar Bhat welcomed the gathering. Acting registrar Siddalingayya Hiremath introduced the chief guest.

The honorary doctor of law degree was conferred on Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta in his absence.

Since the convocation is being held after three years, 45 gold medals and cash prizes were given to three toppers in five disciplines for the past three years. Most of the medals were bagged by students from Bengaluru and Mangaluru.

DHARWAD: Seeking to assure the public of the government’s commitment to containing the spread of the novel coronavirus or Covid-19, Karnataka state law and parliamentary affairs minister JC Madhuswamy on Saturday asked people not to panic.

Madhuswamy, interacting with representatives of the media after the Karnataka State Law University (KSLU) convocation in Dharwad, pointed out that the number of people who had tested positive for the infection across the state did not give one occasion to be alarmed. “But panic appears to have gripped the public. But the government will do all it can to protect people against the infection. We are providing treatment to those who are suspected of having contracted the infection, and to those who have tested positive,” said the minister.

He said that, although the government had prohibited holding of programmes, workshops and other mass events that would be attended by a large number of people, the KSLU convocation could not be called off since students had already arrived in Dharwad for the very purpose. “The ceremony was held only after the government approved it,” Madhuswamy said.

Echoing Madhuswamy’s opinion, former minister and MLC Basavaraj Horatti said that there was no outbreak of the infection in the state. “The only fatality in Karnataka is that of an elderly man who had been to Dubai. But the government must nevertheless take precautions, and ensure that all those coming from abroad are screened,” said Horatti, lauding the state government’s decision to close down schools and colleges.

They include the first positive patient who is under treatment at the IGGMCH, his wife and two of the associates working with him who are being treated at the GMCH.

With three positive patients admitted in their isolation ward, GMCH doctors are sharing a big responsibility. Separate teams of doctors are treating them in three shifts. All three patients in GMCH are placed in separate rooms. As they are not showing any symptoms, doctors are only monitoring their health parameters.

“General parameters like temperature, blood pressure and fluid intake are being monitored. Ensuring nutritional food supply and maintaining meal timings is our priority. They will be tested again for Covid-19 after completion of seven days in isolation,” said one of the doctors treating these patients.

Not only senior doctors, but also residents in GMCH are taking care of these patients. They have been given personal protection kits.

The health of the first positive Covid-19 patient is improving fast. Dr Ajay Keoliya, dean of the IGGMCH, said, “The patient is cooperating well with our doctors. He was prescribed some antibiotics on Friday. His fever has receded significantly but not fully,” he said.

Doctors are focusing on the health parameters of this patient and ensuring that he gets more rest so that the recovery process is quick. He is being treated symptomatically and responding well to all the medicines.

The fourth positive patient, who was detected on Saturday afternoon, was admitted to a separate room in the GMCH isolation ward. This ward has around 17 such separation facilities.

GMCH dean Dr Sajal Mitra has started vacating ward no. 49 which is situated comparatively away from the central building where the present ward is set up. This ward will have better separation facilities and will ensure complete isolation from the other parts of sprawling campus.

GMCH medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande said, “The 20 people whose samples were collected today are from the list prepared after consultation with the already admitted positive patients. They have assured to follow home isolation protocol until their results arrive. One patient who is admitted is a 4-year-old girl having a travel history of Saudi Arabia,” he added.

A batch of 21 Indians arrived at Cochin Airport on Saturday. The family is hoping their sons would be in the next lot of passengers.

The students — Pranav Vairale and Suraj Bundele — have been stranded since Wednesday in Milan after they were refused to board home-bound Air India flight due to lack of coronavirus-free certificate. Vairale and Bundele were unable to produce the certificate as cities have shut down in the country, which has seen over 1,000 deaths and hundreds infected with Covid-19.

Pranav’s granduncle Govind Wairale, who lives in Dhantoli, said his grandnephew and his friend Suraj among other Indians were asked come to Milan airport.

“We assume that they may board the plane to India tonight. But, they will be first screened and probably quarantined for 14 days before they reach home,” said Wairale.

After missing their flight, the students had been running from pillar to post seeking help. A resident of Amravati’s Vaibhav Colony, Pranav is doing MS in civil engineering student from Polytechnico de Milano University, Milan. Suraj, who belongs to Paratwada in Amaravati district, has been studying at University of Marangoni in Milan for the last three years.

417,['15/03/2020'],"Delhi Weather: Relief over, brace for heat in next three days","Weekend rain and hail make it Delhi's wettest March ever

NEW DELHI: A day after Delhi was battered by rain and hailstorm, the capital city is unlikely to receive rain for the next few days, predicts IMD.On Saturday, the showers stretched across the city for over two hours, but lasted barely halfan-hour at one place. Such was the intensity that 37mm of rainfall of rain was recorded at the Safdarjung weather station in barely an hour, the second highest spell of rain in a single day in March since 1992. It was on March 2, 2015 that Delhi had recorded more rain in a day — 56.8mm.This has also made it the city’s wettest March ever with 101.9mm of rainfall recorded this month so far, beating the record set in March 2015 when 97.4mm of rainfall was recorded.Once again, civic preparedness was exposed as major roads, intersections, underpasses and flyovers saw waterlogging across Delhi, affecting traffic movement quite badly. Vehicles were stuck on the roads for hours, with 30-minute trips stretching to over 90 minutes.Delhi’s maximum temperature was 24.7 degrees celsius on Saturday, five degrees below normal. The relief, however, will be shortlived with the maximum temperature forecast to rise from Sunday onwards and could even touch 30 degrees celsius by March 18, said Kuldeep Srivastava, IMD scientist and head of Regional Weather Forecasting Centre (RWFC) in Delhi.He said the western disturbance impacting Delhi and NCR will move away by Saturday night and there will be no rain on Sunday.According to the IMD, most parts of Delhi, besides Noida and Greater Noida, experienced a spell of hail.“After the rain, the maximum temperature fell, but with no rain likely in the next few days, it will touch 27 degrees on Sunday and the 30 degree mark by Wednesday. This particular western disturbance had been influencing north-west India since the night of March 10,” said Srivastava, adding that there had been nine rainy days in March already.Srivastava said the hailstorm was caused due a reduction in the height of the freezing layer of the atmosphere, which with vertical wind shear led to easy formation of hail. “The freezing layer, where temperature is 0 degrees Celsius, is generally at a height of 4-5 km during this time of the year. It, however, fell to around 2-2.5km during this spell of western disturbance spell. The closer it is to the ground, more the chances of hail reaching the surface. Strong vertical and horizontal winds only aided the process,” said Srivastava.While Delhi’s base observatory, Safdarjung, received 37mm of rainfall between 8.30 pm and 5.30 pm, Lodhi Road recorded even more during this period — 47.6mm. The Ridge and Ayanagar stations received 19.6mm and 3.2mm of rainfall, respectively. Palam, meanwhile, received just 0.4mm of rainfall with airport officials saying there was little to no impact of the rain on flight operations.The IMD classifies rainfall between 15.5m to 64.4mm in a single day as ‘moderate’ and more than 64.5mm as ‘heavy’. The spell of rain also meant Delhi’s air quality improved from an AQI of 173 on Friday (moderate) to 108 (moderate) on Saturday and could drop below the 100 mark on Sunday.Meanwhile, the twin cities of Noida and Ghaziabad too received rainfall accompanied by hailstorm at number of places on Saturday afternoon. According of IMD official the area received highest rainfall in March, which is a record with Safdarjung recording 101.9 mm rainfall. Western Disturbance created cyclonic circulation in the NCR resulting in rainfall.“The rainfall which was accompanied by thunderstorm and hailstorm on Saturday was due to western disturbance in North West India which may continue till Sunday” said Kuldeep Srivastava from, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre (RWFC), IMD.Hailstrom hit number of places in Noida and Greater Noida and at scatter places in Ghaziabad bringing temperature down. “During Feb to May decrease in the freezing level height is normally between 4km and 5km during this time of year but on Saturday it was between 2km to 2.5 km which resulted in hailstorm” added Srivastava. “By March 18 maximum temperature is expected to reach 30 degrees Celsius” he added.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74633159,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-217325,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-relief-over-brace-for-heat-in-three-days/articleshow/74633150.cms

The MSRDC has been asked to draw up an environment-friendly project report.

419,['15/03/2020'],‘Creamy layer’ tweak: BJP MP puts govt under lens,"NEW DELHI: As the Centre mulls a radical tweak to “creamy layer” norms for OBCs, the controversial issue is set to notch a first of sorts to its credit. A parliamentary committee chairman, belonging to the ruling BJP, is putting his own government under the microscope.

On March 3, Ganesh Singh , who heads the committee on welfare of other backward classes, asked a question to Union social justice ministry about the vexed issue of “salary” being included in the “gross income” of OBCs working in PSUs for determining the “creamy layer”. In answer, the government gave a safe reply narrating the factual position.

While the 1993 Office Memorandum of DoPT lays down that “salaries” will not be included in “gross income”, the Centre over last six years has been doing so in case of backwards working in PSUs while steering clear of “salary” in case of OBCs employed in state and central governments. Delhi and Madras high courts earlier slammed the practice as “discriminatory”.

An MP from Madhya Pradesh belonging to Mandal classes, Singh’s probing query to social justice ministry would not have attracted attention but for one crucial fact. As chairman of the committee on welfare of OBCs, he gave a report on “rationalisation of creamy layer” in March 2019 in wh- ich he discussed in detail the issue of “discriminatory” application of “creamy layer” norms. The panel’s recommendations categorically stated that a uniform policy of leaving out “salary” from “gross income” should be followed for all OBCs.

Viewed as intractable, the issue is being fought in the Supreme Court by successful UPSC candidates, including IAS, who were categorised as “creamy layer” and left out.

As a political observer said, it is rare for a committee chairman to ask a question in Parliament on the issue he has dealt with in his panel.

But that is not all. Now, the “committee on welfare of OBCs” has convened a meeting on March 19 to discuss the action taken by the Centre on its report on “rationalisation of creamy layer”.

What renders the controversy more interesting is that the Centre, to simplify the 1993 OM, recently moved a proposal that “salary” be included in “gross income” of all categories of OBCs — employed in governments or PSUs. The proposal has kicked up a row as backwards believe the step would more easily put an OBC in the “creamy layer” bracket, thereby pushing out more backwards from the ambit of job reservations.

Now, the OBC panel may probe the ministry on the new proposal and put the government in the dock.

421,['15/03/2020'],'Bureaucracy slows down reforms approved by PM’,"Arvind Panagariya (file photo)

NEW DELHI: India’s bureaucracy often suffers from a socialist overhang that leads it to slow down, even block reforms that the top leadership has sought to implement, former NITI Aayog vice chairman Arvind Panagariya has said in his latest book.

He cites the government attempts to privatise a large number of public sector enterprises which have remained stalled despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s push to get cabinet approval for the list of companies drawn up by the NITI Aayog.

“But once the matter went to the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), it remained stuck there,” Panagariya says in his book — ‘India Unlimited, Reclaiming the Lost Glory’, adding that labour law reforms offered another example of how the bureaucracy blocked efforts of the political executive.

He says bureaucracy’s adherence to socialism remains deeply rooted in the education its members receive in Indian universities, where faculty members are often wedded to anti-business and anti-market ideology.

“Given the dream of an ideal world that the socialist ideology offers, the young are naturally drawn to it. This attraction is reinforced by anti-market ideas that their teachers in colleges impart them,” says Panagariya, who was the first vice chairman of NITI Aayog, a government think-tank that replaced Planning Commission.

“A final example relates to the civil services reform. Prime Minister Modi has pushed for lateral entry at the top levels of the bureaucracy for several years. But going by publicly available information, it is a reasonable conclusion that bureaucracy slowed down the process to such a degree that it was only at the very end of his term that nine officers could be inducted from outside,” says Panagariya, who returned to academia and is a professor of economics at Columbia University.

“Civil services in India pick up many among these youngsters (taught by Left-leaning faculties) at an early age. Once inside the government, they find themselves safely in the company of others like them for the remainder of their professional lives,” he says.

The Columbia University professor also does not spare India Inc for the lethargy towards reforms.

“Remarkably, in India even business leaders have played an insignificant role in pushing for market-friendly reforms. In most countries, businesses try to use an economic crisis as an opportunity to seek removal of regulations that impede their progress. But in India, they use a crisis as the opportunity to seek subsidies and protection from imports,” he says.

“They want the government to intervene more, not less to save their specific sector or industry, With rare exceptions, even business organisations and associations, which are expected to represent the collective interest of business, have not bothered to push for pro-growth reforms,” Panagariya says.

422,['15/03/2020'],"Coronavirus in West Bengal: All schools, colleges, universities to remain shut till March 31","KOLKATA: The state government on Saturday escalated its defence against Covid-19 by announcing the closure of all schools, colleges and universities. Later in the evening, several museums including the iconic Indian Museum and Victoria Memorial Hall announced closure till the month-end. CM Mamata Banerjee had on Friday cancelled all sporting events in the state.Though Bengal is yet to record any confirmed cases of Covid-19 — all 52 samples tested so far have returned negative while 3,238 people are under home surveillance — the government decided to join the Centre and other states in further fortifying the protective shield.“In view of the evolving situation on the spread of Covid-19, the advisories issued by WHO, UN and central government and as a matter of abundant precaution to check its spread in West Bengal, it has been decided that all government, government-aided, private education institutions including schools, colleges, universities and madrasahs will remain closed from March 16 up to March 31. While internal examinations will be suspended, board examinations will continue as per schedule,” a release issued by the CM’s office stated.Calcutta University put on hold all examinations after the announcement while Jadavpur University and Presidency said their administrative offices will remain open. Presidency also shut down the hostels. IIT Kharagpur and IIEST Shibpur, which announced closure on Friday, will hold online classes. All seminars, conferences, workshops and tours have also been postponed. IIM Calcutta, which has already deferred its convocation, may hold online interviews of shortlisted candidates for admission to the 2020-22 academic session.A state education department official said the decision is unlikely to inconvenience younger students as most schools have already finished annual examinations and the new academic session is yet to begin. “If required, additional classes can be held later,” he added.Later in an interview to a television channel, the CM said the measures are precautionary in nature. “We are blessed that no one has tested positive yet. There is no need to panic. But it also does not mean we should let our guard down. Bengal shares the boundary with three countries. There is no room for complacency. The decision to suspend classes is to avoid big gatherings that can accelerate the process of infection should it arrive here,” the CM said.The CM also said the state had set up two quarantine facilities that could accommodate 300-400 patients should the need arise. “We have started opening isolation wards in districts. Doctors and all government agencies are working overtime to keep us safe,” Banerjee said.On Saturday, the state chief secretary, home secretary and DGP apprised the Union health secretary of measures taken by the state to combat an outbreak.Even before the CM’s directive, several schools had started taking measures to tide over the rapidly-changing developments. Both Lakshmipat Singhania Academy and South City International School had decided to distribute results of the annual exam through email. “We do not want any gathering on school premises hence all parent-teacher meetings stand cancelled. We shall distribute the results on email,” South City International School principal John Bagul said. Even school competitions were called off.Others, including the La Martiniere, Loreto and DPS schools, responded to the CM’s announcements with circulars that announced the closure till March 31 instead of fresh classes after the term break. “All classes and other pre-scheduled programmes will remain suspended till March 31 as a preventive measure against Covid-19. The new session will start from April 1,” said an official of DPS Ruby Park which was scheduled to begin new session from March 19.For some schools, though, the order will mean suspension of the annual exams midway. “Since we are a boarding school, it will be difficult to reschedule the exams after March. We are still trying to work out a solution,” said Aditi Mukherjee, principal of GEMS Academia International School.There is also confusion over attendance of teachers and staff. “There is no clarity if staff and teachers will have to attend schools and colleges,” said a teachers’ body member. St Xavier’s College, though, made it clear in its notice that while the college would be shut, all offices would stay open.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74633456,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-163399,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/all-schools-colleges-univs-in-state-to-remain-shut-till-mar-31/articleshow/74632966.cms
423,['15/03/2020'],BJP outreach in Bhowanipore,"Kolkata: Bengal BJP leade-rs led by junior Union minister Debashree Chowdhury on Saturday undertook a door-to-door campaign in the wards of Mamata Banerjee’s home turf Bhowanipore assembly seat, a day ahead of TMC’s public outreach programme in ward 73.

Chowdhury, BJP’s Barrackpore MP Arjun Singh and party state general secretary Sayantan Basu met voters in wards 63, 70 and 71 in an attempt to tap the “potential” in this assembly seat ahead of the 2021 West Bengal polls. “We will field a heavyweight strong enough to hold back the CM in Bhowanipore. She won’t be able to move out of her constituency,” Basu said. tnn

He recalled that the ruling Trinamool had trailed in many city wards under Bhowanipore assembly seat in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. “Voters in these wards have many grievances. We will follow it up,” Basu said.

Aware of the dents made by BJP in Bhowanipore, Trinamool has arranged a programme in ward 73 to win back disgruntled party supporters who have opted out of active politics. “We want to give these Trinamool old-timers an opportunity to pour their hearts out at a meeting scheduled at Jai Hind Hall on March 15,” Trinamool president Subrata Bakshi had said last Tuesday.

424,['15/03/2020'],"Ratna ‘gives up’ TMC task, fuels buzz of Sovan’s return","Kolkata: The rumours of former Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee’s return to Trinamool Congress got stronger on Saturday after his estranged wife and Trinamool organiser Ratna Chatterjee “abdicated” her party assignment as coordinator of the Banglar Gorbo Mamata (BGM) programme for Behala East, from where Sovan is an MLA.

The Sovan camp read the development as a “positive signal” from Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee because the former mayor had made it loud and clear that it was not possible for him to do politics alongside his estranged wife. Ratna, however, said she remains the Trinamool mentor of Sovan’s ward 131 since the day he left the locality and later joined BJP.

Ratna did the U-turn on Friday, days after Trinamool secretary general Partha Chatterjee made her the BGM coordinator for Behala East. The only development in between was Sovan’s friend Baisakhi Banerjee calling on chief minister Banerjee at Nabanna on Thursday.

On Friday, Partha held the “jalajog jogajog” programme as part of BGM in Behala West assembly constituency, but the programme was stalled for Behala East. According to Trinamool sources, the responsibility has now been given to Trinamool’s ward 107 councillor Sushanta Ghosh.

Ratna told TOI that she gave up the responsibility on her own.

“No one asked me to give up the assignment. I went to (MP) Abhishek Banerjee’s office on my own and told him I can’t handle the responsibility. I know my ward (131). There is no internal feud in TMC here. But I am not so comfortable with the entire Behala East constituency spread over Joka to Taratala. Abhishek tried to prevail over me. But I stuck to my point because I didn’t want to put my party in trouble in the run-up to 2021 assembly polls,” she said.

Asked if “giving up” the Behala East assignment was her “sacrifice” to bring Sovan back to Trinamool, Ratna said: “I will be happy if Sovan comes back to Trinamool. But that doesn’t mean I will take leave from politics if he returns. I will pursue politics in my own right. I haven’t done anything against the party. I couldn’t take proper care of my children while doing politics. Why should I sacrifice my political life for Sovan?”

Ratna may at best concentrate on ward 131 and give more attention to the adjoining Maheshtala assembly seat in future. “People in Behala East know me as Sovan Chatterjee’s wife. But in Maheshtala, people know me by my nickname Buri. I was born there and spent 22 years in the locality before I got married to Sovan,” she said.

Whatever the deal, Baisakhi is singing praises of BGM programme. “Banglar Gorbo Mamata slogan is ringing in people’s hearts. It matters little who implements the programme. It could be someone today and some other tomorrow,” she said. In the same breath, Baisakhi said that the Behala East development was indeed “positive”.

The Bengal BJP, on the other hand, seemed to have lost track of the ups and downs of the Sovan episode. “Sovan Chatterjee is with BJP. But he has not responded yet,” said BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu.

The bodies of Nim Dorjee Tamang (33), Pemba Diki Tamang (21) and their son Nihal were taken to the block primary health centre at Rammam and then to Darjeeling district hospital for post-mortem.

The couple’s daughter, Class VI student Dichen, was with a relative at the time. GJM (Tamang) unit president Norden Sherpa visited the spot and said he would approach GTA for compensation and help. “GTA chairman Anit Thapa is on his way to Tamang Gaon. We will seek help for the girl to ensure her studies are not hampered. Those who have gone will not come back, but at least we can help the child,” he said.

According to Sherpa, the accident occurred due to leakage of water from the pipeline above the house. “We found that the pipeline had been laid atop a wall just above the house. The wall was also built on loose soil. Water may have leaked from the pipe and accumulated over time. It finally burst and cracked the wall, which crushed the house,” he said.

Sources said mud and soil from construction sites of homes built by Tamang Development Board had been dumped above the house. “It is unfortunate that three persons died, but the mudslide was not huge. The loose soil and wall may have crashed directly on top of the house, which was built of mud and stones,” Sherpa said.

Anukul Bajaj, of Sehore, had coerced the 16-year-old to share her photos by threatening to morph her face and circulate sexually explicit images. Bajaj had assured her he would not do so if she shared her nude photos with him. Her father lodged a complaint at Tallah PS on September 20 last year.

The court found Bajaj guilty and sentenced him. It ordered him to pay Rs 20,000 fine, 90% of which will go to the girl as compensation. The state too will pay her Rs 50,000 compensation for the mental trauma she suffered, the court ordered.

That’s the question that’s giving Tollywood filmmakers sleepless nights at the moment. And the uncertainty is what prompted makers of the Nani and Sudheer Babu-starrer V to postpone their film’s release by a month. “The outbreak of the coronavirus has made us think about our responsibility of keeping the health and safety of the public in mind. We have decided to postpone the film at the moment with an intention of releasing the film in the month of April 2020,” the makers of V said in a statement issued on Saturday.Producers of Rana Daggubati-starrer Aaranya, which was scheduled to release on April 2, have also postponed the film’s release. Meanwhile makers of Anushka Shetty-starrer Nishabdam and Ram Pothineni ’s RED are also thinking on similar lines. “We are currently monitoring the situation. We will be meeting with other film producers and Executive Council members and take a final decision about the release of our film in the next few days,” shares Hemanth Madhukar, director of Nishabdam.The makers of Vaishnav Tej’s debut film Uppena, which is set to release on April 2, are equally nervous. “We’re monitoring the situation very closely. We don’t want to end up in a situation where cinema halls shut down soon after the release of the film, like it has happened with Angrezi Medium. We are going to observe how things are going to unfold and take a decision soon,” says Ravi Shankar Yelamanchili, co-producer of the film. Sravanti Ravi Kishore, producer of the upcoming Ram Pothineni-starrer RED, remains optimistic. “Theatres across the country have only shut till March 31. Our film is slated to release on April 9 so there is still time. We are hopeful that we can eliminate the threat of the coronavirus by then and normalcy will be restored. The safety of the public is of primary importance to us, but it’s too early to take a call right now,” Kishore says.At the time of going to press, a high level committee of Telangana government was in a meeting mulling over the future course of action. Senior producer D Suresh Babu , says filmmakers will decide whether or not to postpone their films based on the decision the government’s decision. “It’s a matter of public safety and the government will take the final call.

430,['15/03/2020'],Coronavirus in Karnataka: Karnataka has tested highest number of coronavirus suspected cases,"Offices can function but offer home shift, says deputy CM

BENGALURU: Karnataka has tested the highest number of people for coronavirus in the country, the state government said on Saturday. So far, 731 samples have been processed.“On Saturday alone, 92 samples were collected for testing,” said medical education minister K Sudhakar.No new positive cases have come to light. The state’s figure for coronavirus infections stands at six, including an elderly Kalaburagi man who died this week. The health department said 50 new samples had turned out to be negative. Overall, 590 samples didn’t show any coronavirus infection.In a new measure, Sudhakar said passengers who showed symptoms on arrival at Karnataka’s airports would be directly taken to the designated hospital. Until now, passengers with suspected symptoms were put under observation and asked to self-isolate at home. The new rule will help the state keep a check on new cases and improve overall surveillance.The minister praised the medical teams involved in the fight to contain Covid-19: “They have been working tirelessly to screen, test and treat patients.” So far, over 1 lakh passengers have been screened at the state’s airports and seaports.Deputy chief minister CN Ashwath Narayan, meanwhile, has urged companies to encourage employees to work from home as a precaution to decongest workplaces and accelerate the government’s efforts to mitigate impact of the coronavirus outbreak.The government’s earlier communication on a weeklong shutdown had created some confusion among business parks and companies about whether they too needed to close. It has now made it clear that workplaces can function, but all efforts must be made to get as many people to work from home as possible.“Abundant caution is the need of the hour. Employee safety and business continuity are important to the IT business across the state,” Narayan said. “With Karnataka being home to over 35% of the Indian IT workforce, employee safety becomes very important. At the same time, as a leading sourcing hub, business continuity is also important. The state government is making all efforts to work with the industry on both these aspects,”He said the additional chief secretary in the department of IT/BT, EV Ramana Reddy, had also written to the department of telecommunications (DOT) to enable work from home through modification of other service providers licences (OSPs), and the same had now been accepted. As TOI reported, DoT has relaxed restrictions on OSPs, which include call centres and medical transcript service providers up to April 30. DoT has set these restrictions to ensure that customer data is safe.Narayan said many firms had put out advisories on nonessential travel and asked employees returning from abroad to undergo self-quarantine. He emphasised the need for deep sterilisation of premises, cancellation of events and internal taskforces to regularly monitor the situation.

431,['15/03/2020'],Delhi government clears way for hefty spot fines by traffic cops,"With spot fine okayed, cops may use old data of ‘ineffective’ speed cameras

NEW DELHI: The Delhi government has, finally, notified the amended Motor Vehicles (MV) Act, which will allow police to issue spot fines. This will bring an end to flouting of traffic rules in the city with the hefty fines — all retained — acting as an effective deterrent. Implementation will happen after the notification is soon published in the Delhi Gazette.The amended law was notified by the Centre in September 2019, but not ratified by the Delhi government. The city government has done the needful and decided not to reduce the quantum of punishment of the compoundable offences despite having the discretionary power to do so.All this while, police were issuing court challans to violators caught on the road. But due to the limited capacity of courts, only 5,000-7,000 challans were issued per week. The figure is likely to jump with police getting a free hand.It will be easier for violators to pay the fines as court visits are time-consuming while the police won’t have to rely on discretion and just follow procedure.Jumping a traffic signal — a common offence — will invite a fine of Rs 5,000 or a year in prison or both. Speaking on phone while driving will invite the same penalty while speeding could incur a penalty of up to Rs 2,000 and impounding of the vehicle and licence. Even obstructing traffic by way of improper parking will result in a fine of Rs 500.Those who indulge in rash or dangerous driving have trouble up ahead. The first offence will invite a oneyear jail term or Rs 5,000 or both while any subsequent offence will result in imprisonment of up to two years and Rs 10,000 as fine.Speed cameras had become ineffective due to the inability of the police to issue spot fines. This led to a 60% dip in the number of challans since January 1 this year as compared to the corresponding period in 2019. As soon as drivers learnt about it, they started ignoring the curbs. Police say that they may use data captured earlier to take action now.“Road safety is of prime concern to the Delhi government, and keeping that in mind, a conscious decision has been taken to keep the maximum prescribed penalties for all compoundable offences. Though the state governments have certain discretionary powers to ease the penalties with respect to certain offences as per the new MV Act, we have decided to not dilute them since the stringent measures are meant to ensure road safety,” transport minister Kailash Gahlot said.He added, “The Delhi government has brought a road safety policy (2018) and we are very serious about road safety. The decision has been taken after thorough consultations with all stakeholders such as traffic police and transport department apart from public feedback. We have also created a road safety cell with a fulltime special commissioner to ensure compliance.”The notification signed by K K Dahiya, special commissioner (transport), has been issued with the approval of LG Anil Baijal. “The notification has been sent to our press in Mayapuri and as soon as it is published in the Delhi Gazette, enforcement agencies will be able to issue spot fines,” a Delhi government official said.“Officers of the rank of head constable and above of traffic police or transport department will be able to issue fines up to Rs 1,000. But for most offences, officers of the rank of assistant sub-inspector and above have been conferred the authority,” he said.Police believe incidents of road offences, especially speeding, racing and stunt biking, will come down now. These three offences alone result in almost 40% of road deaths in Delhi, say police.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74633238,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-164283,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-government-clears-way-for-hefty-spot-fines-by-traffic-cops/articleshow/74633230.cms
432,['15/03/2020'],"Post-Scindia, focus on ‘Rahul’s Young Turks’","NEW DELHI: Jyotiraditya Scindia’s exit from Congress amid claims that Rahul Gandhi failed to protect his friend’s political interest has trained the focus back on the absentee leadership of the party after the 2019 Lok Sabha debacle. But, as significantly if not more, it has shone the spotlight on the group of youngsters that during the UPA decade came to be known as Rahul’s Young Turks. Following Congress’s sixth year out of power amid continuous diminution in its ability to dispense favours, the once-considered homogeneous bloc is splintered into myriad groups.

As an insider smirked, “There are youngsters who are in favour, those who are feeling left out and those who are getting benefits despite Rahul Gandhi.” The latest round of Rajya Sabha nominations for limited seats at Congress disposal has only buttressed the theory.

AICC general secretary in-charge of organisation, K C Venugopal, a former MP from Kerala , has got RS from Rajasthan. Rajeev Satav , former Youth Congress president and one-term MP who is now AICC in-charge of Gujarat, has managed the much sought-after seat from Maharashtra. Deepender Hooda is set to return to Parliament from Haryana.

They are fortunate. By inside accounts, 2020 will go in history as that rare year when an unprecedented number of young leaders pitched their claims for the House of Elders — a reflection of belief in Congress that it is going to be a long winter after two successive Lok Sabha debacles. In sharp contrast, many expectant ones have been left out.

Milind Deora is considered close to Rahul and was said to have been committed a seat. Randeep Surjewala group believes he could not win his assembly seat in 2019 Haryana polls because he, as spokesman, led the attacks on Modi government and was targeted by BJP. Jitin Prasada was another hopeful. Sachin Pilot is Rajasthan Congress chief and deputy CM in state government but his supporters believe he was shortchanged after the party won in December 2018 polls. Away from those in and out of favour are leaders like Hooda who are having their way despite Rahul Gandhi.

Bhupinder Singh Hooda managed to oust Rahul’s nominee Ashok Tanwar as Haryana chief before state polls and has now ensured his son Deepender enters RS after losing LS polls.

BENGALURU: Contrary to the claims made by the UP government on Friday, Karnataka said on Saturday that the Agra woman, wife of the Google techie who tested positive for Covid-19, never entered Bengaluru city. After arriving at the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA), Bengaluru, on March 8, she took a flight to Delhi in barely two hours, much before her husband tested positive on March 12, said medical education minister Dr K Sudhakar.UP health officials had claimed that the 25-year-old escaped from a Bengaluru quarantine on March 8. Refuting this claim, Sudhakar said: ""On March 8, the couple took an Indigo flight from Mumbai and landed in Bengaluru at 11.45pm. The wife did not step out of KIA. She took another flight from Bengaluru to Delhi at 1.40am on March 9, and reached Delhi at 4.25am. From Delhi, she took a train, Gatimaan Express, to reach her parent's house in Agra."" When contacted, the techie's brother told STOI that his sister-in-law never refused to be quarantined.The techie’s brother added that his sisterin-law is not infected with Covid-19, as claimed by the UP officials. “The first test report was ‘inconclusive’. The second one is still awaited. But even before that, my sister-in-law has been declared Covid-19 positive, which is not true,” he said.Officials who investigated the woman’s itinerary spoke to her husband and gathered information, said Sudhakar. The techie tested positive on March 12 and was admitted to the hospital the same day.

But every responsible citizen must now equally care for their and others’ health. Not all travellers would be infected with Covid-19, but everyone must co-operate with the health department officials in screening and contact tracing,” Sudhakar said.Javaid Akthar, additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, reminded that “hiding travel details and not adhering to the home isolation are both morally and legally wrong”.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74633258,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-376761,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/agra-woman-never-entered-bengaluru-city-says-karnataka-govt/articleshow/74633254.cms
435,['15/03/2020'],"Ruckus in Maharashtra assembly as BJP ups ante on CAA, NPR","MUMBAI: The Maharashtra assembly on Saturday witnessed uproarious scenes when opposition BJP raised the issue of the CAA, NRC and NPR. The treasury benches objected to the issue of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) being raised. The issues pending before the Supreme Court and falling under the Union government's purview can not be discussed in state legislature, they said.

During the ruckus, both sides traded charges. The Speaker ordered expunging of most of these remarks.

Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis raised the issue during a debate on budgetary demands of the Home Department . The CAA does not take away the citizenship of Indian citizens, “but rumours are being spread about CAA,” he said. “In NPR, giving information is optional. The prime minister has already said the NRC is not being implemented,” Fadnavis, a former chief minister, said.

Home minister Anil Deshmukh said the BJP leader should speak only on the budgetary demands. Minority affairs minister Nawab Malik said Fadnavis himself had said during the winter session that issues under the Centre’s purview should not be discussed in the House.

BJP’s Sudhir Mungantiwar said Fadnavis had not spoken anything negative. “We want misconceptions about the Act to go and there should not be any unrest,” he said. Malik and food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal said the issue of CAA was being heard in the Supreme Court and it could not be discussed in the House. Speaker Nana Patole adjourned the House for 30 minutes when members from both the sides rushed to the well and traded charges.

455,['15/03/2020'],353% rise in pending rape trials in Delhi,"NEW DELHI: Despite the highest sensitivity shown by courts on speeding up rape cases and an existing law that provides for completion of trial of such cases within a year, the pendency of such cases has increased by more than 46% across the country since March 2018 with Delhi reporting the highest percentage increase of 353% during this period.

The Union law ministry has collected data from different high courts on all pending rape cases across the country, including those against children. A comparative study between the data reported as of March 2018 and December 2019 show pending cases related to rape and those registered under Protection of Children against Sexual Offences ( Pocso ) Act have increased by over 77,000 — from 1,66,882 to 2,44,001.

The highest pendency in absolute terms has been in UP where the number of cases has increased from 36,000 to 67,000 during this period. Maharashtra , West Bengal , MP, Bihar, Rajasthan, Delhi, in that order, are among the states that have reported highest pendency of rape cases after UP.

Two states, UP and MP, have shown increase in pendency of rape cases by over 80% while Delhi has shown a phenomenal growth of over 353% despite the fact that it has many fast track courts (FTCs) already running to dispose of the pendency.

Established laws on rape and Pocso have failed to have any impact on speeding up disposal, it seems. “The Pocso Act mandates that the investigation in the cases involving children is to be completed in two months (from the date of registration of the FIR) and trial in six months. However, despite a strong law and policy framework, large number of rape and Pocso Act cases are pending in various courts in the country,” the law ministry has noted. It has, however, not mentioned for how long these cases have been undergoing trials.

TOI had reported on December 7, 2019 that more than 96% of the total 1,66,882 pending rape trials were Pocso Act cases, a grim reminder of the fact that children continue to suffer mental trauma for years due to the delay in justice delivery.

Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had then given an assurance to Parliament that all pending rape case, including 1,60,989 Pocso Act cases, would be disposed of within a year. The government set a target of one year, spread over 2019-20 and 2020-21, to complete trial of all these pending cases by setting up 1,023 FTCs across the country.

The law ministry, which has received data on all pending rape and Pocso cases from each of the high courts, says there are 389 districts in the country where the number of pending cases under Pocso Act exceeds 100. The government has issued directives to set up a Pocso fast track court in each of these districts, which is also in compliance of a similar directive from the Supreme Court.

A Pocso court also has provision for in-camera trial in a child-friendly environment without revealing the identity of children.

BENGALURU: People in home isolation over Covid-19 concerns for 14 days in Karnataka should call the 104 helpline twice a day on their own, according to a new measure.In all, 1,308 people are under home isolation in the state as on Saturday. Till now, helpline staff were supposed to call those under home isolation to check on their health. However, several people in home isolation that STOI spoke to said they had hardly got calls from the department staff.A man, 34, who returned from China in mid-January, self-reported himself at RGICD and tested negative for the infection, said: “I was discharged soon after my report was negative. For the 28 days since I returned from China, I was under home isolation and I got calls only twice.” Health officials visited his apartment on one occasion. Another man who returned from Japan in February first week, said he had no symptoms and was not tested, but was registered with the helpline for home isolation. “I got calls only once in the first week. On the last day, I made a call and told them I was fine. I was told that I could get back to my normal routine,” he said.Given the jump in the number of suspected cases, not all with suspicion of infection are getting admitted in hospitals in the city, thanks to very few beds in isolation wards. Only cases showing severe symptoms are being admitted.Those suspected are being asked to give samples and they are hospitalised only if they test positive, ahead of another confirmatory test. With this delay in hospitalisation, there are chances that the infection can spread, say experts.“In case the person turns out to be positive, an ambulance is sent to his/her house to be brought to the hospital,” a source said. On Friday, the government made it clear that all those returning from affected countries will have to remain in home isolation for 14 days, whether they have symptoms or not.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74633329,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-402762,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/covid-19-in-karnataka-1308-people-under-home-isolation-asked-to-provide-health-updates/articleshow/74633325.cms
462,['15/03/2020'],Sexual health tests still a challenge for disabled women,"NEW DELHI: Meenu Arora Mani had a frightful experience after the mammogram at a private hospital could not come to level of her wheelchair and she was shifted to a revolving chair with no arms. As she suffers from cerebral palsy and cannot sit without support, the screening could finally be done only with the help of four women who held her during the test. Mani is just one of the cases which show how sexual and reproductive health checks, tests and even communication with doctors and counsellors on subjects like sexuality, contraception, pregnancy , child birth and menopause remain a challenge for disabled women.

Case studies on this find space in a manual for practitioners developed by disability rights activist Abha Khetarpal who leads a voluntary organisation, “Cross the Hurdles”, that focuses on counselling women on such issues. Khetarpal, who is also wheelchair-bound, shows through a detailed need assessment survey of 50 disabled women from Delhi how their sexual and reproductive health continues to remain in the closet.

The study of women with average age of 36 years, shows that 72% of them did not go for regular health check-ups. While more than half of them were aware of various screening tests required to maintain sexual and reproductive health, 88% had never gone through any screening like mammogram and PAP smear. Around 58% of them said they faced barriers during check-ups.

Among the barriers, 36% of women cited inaccessible examination tables as a major hurdle, around 18% cited the absence of a sign language interpreter; and 14% complained of lack of assistance for balance and positioning during check-up, particularly pelvic examination. Women with visual disabilities faced difficulty over prescriptions. Lack of comprehensive education on sexuality was evident among 66% of them.

“This study and manual is my way of opening space for a dialogue and reaching out to practitioners with possible solutions so that the system can be equipped with a response mechanism,” Khetarpal said. She plans to now approach the ministries of women and child development and social justice and empowerment to draw their attention to these concerns.

The case of a woman with spinal injury is a telling commentary. In her 35th week of pregnancy, she was faced with uncertainty as there was no anaesthetist to handle her case at the hospital. She went ahead with pregnancy only after a green signal from a neurologist and gynaecologist . Finally, doctors found out a way out and she gave birth to a healthy baby.

The manual quotes Reshma Valliappan, director of ‘The Red Door India’, as saying, “Honestly with schizophrenia we don’t get to sexual health. We’re stereotyped at the basic level of comprehension. ”

The standing committee on road transport and highways ministry has also raised concern over poor quality of highways on several stretches and recommended deploying latest technology to monitor road conditions.

The committee further recommends that there should be strict accountability about the condition of roads which may be shared with the authorities as well as the concessionaire carrying out the road project.

It has also recommended adequate fund allocation for periodic quality checks over different stretches of a road under construction or maintenance, during various phases of the project, and also after its completion.

“The committee further recommends that the ministry should chalk out a road quality score mechanism which can be updated throughout the various stages of progress of a road project. This score should be based on the quality of construction material, compliance with safety standards and user feedback. This score would also help in assessing the amount of funds needed to carry out repair works on the road – with roads needing less maintenance getting higher scores,” the report said.

It said the scoring of road projects should be linked to contractors’ portfolio and priority in awarding a road project be given to those contractors with a history of constructing quality road projects.

MUMBAI: CNG pump owners threatened to go on a protest and shut down all pumps across Mumbai to protest against the closure of four privately-owned pumps - two in Mumbai, one in Thane and another in Navi Mumbai - from Sunday midnight. A shutdown could have a major impact on the city's public transport system as autorickshaws, taxis, private cabs and a significant number of buses ply on this compressed natural gas.

According to its latest show cause notice, Mahanagar Gas Limited (MGL) has decided to cut off CNG supply to these four pumps for non-compliance with the company's new terms and conditions to sign fresh agreements. MGL caters to fueling needs of over seven lakh CNG vehicles through a network of 250 CNG stations in and around Mumbai.

A member of United CNG Dealers Association representing the private pumps said, ""This is unfair. The privately-owned pumps have been serving Mumbai motorists and public transport for several years, even before MGL had laid gas pipelines. Now, they are arm-twisting us to give our land on lease and asking us to sign new terms and conditions without taking us into confidence.""

There are around 36 privately-owned pump owners who are protesting with support from Petrol Dealers Association which is an umbrella body for nearly 200 CNG pumps in Mumbai region.

A delegation on pumps owners will be meeting senior officials of GAIL in New Delhi on Monday morning to voice their protest.

An MGL statement on Saturday said: "" We called all the four dealers for discussions on the signing of new agreements aligned with the current policies of the Company. Instead of engaging with MGL, these dealers have resorted to forming their association and threatened to take coercive actions, including, stoppage of operations at their outlets which would inconvenience citizens. Any such disruptive action will be inappropriate, inconsiderate and unfair. In any eventuality, MGL will take all necessary steps to maintain an uninterrupted supply of CNG.""

As of now the number of affected people is close to 145,000 worldwide with 83 cases having been reported in India. However, some areas of the world have been hit worse than the others. China, Italy, South Korea and Iran have been hit severely. Italy, one of the worse hit, saw a sudden rise in the number of positive coronavirus cases. With the number of infected increasing by the minute, the hospitals and medical staff in the country had a tough time managing the pandemic. All non-urgent activities in the hospitals were suspended to accommodate the coronavirus patients.Dr Daniele Macchini, an ICU physician in Italy, posted on Facebook on March 6 describing the working of the hospital on that day as compared to before the pandemic broke.He posted, “All this rapid transformation brought an atmosphere of silence and surreal emptiness to the corridors of the hospital that we did not yet understand, waiting for a war that was yet to begin and that many (including me) were not so sure would ever come with such ferocity.”“The war has literally exploded, and battles are uninterrupted day and night. But now that need for beds has arrived in all its drama. One after the other the departments that had been emptied fill up at an impressive pace. The boards with the names of the patients, of different colours depending on the operating unit, are now all red and instead of surgery you see the diagnosis, which is always the damned same: bilateral interstitial pneumonia.”He paints a vivid picture of the entire staff coming together to tackle the patients pouring in. “And there are no more surgeons, urologists, orthopedists, we are only doctors who suddenly become part of a single team to face this tsunami that has overwhelmed us. Cases are multiplying, they arrive at a rate of 15-20 admissions per day all for the same reason. The results of the swabs now come one after the other: positive, positive, positive. Suddenly the E.R. is collapsing,” his post reads.“Reasons for the access always the same: fever and breathing difficulties, fever and cough, respiratory failure. Radiology reports always the same: bilateral interstitial pneumonia, bilateral interstitial pneumonia, bilateral interstitial pneumonia. All to be hospitalized.”The spread of the virus in the country has been sudden causing dearth of medical facilities and beds to treat everybody. “The staff is exhausted. I saw the tiredness on faces that didn't know what it was despite the already exhausting workloads they had. I saw solidarity of all of us, who never failed to go to our internist colleagues to ask, ""what can I do for you now?” Doctors who move beds and transfer patients, who administer therapies instead of nurses. Nurses with tears in their eyes because we can't save everyone, and the vital parameters of several patients at the same time reveal an already marked destiny. There are no more shifts, no more hours. Social life is suspended for us. We no longer see our families for fear of infecting them. Some of us have already become infected despite the protocols,” says Dr Macchini in his Facebook postWith the outbreak having been declared a pandemic and most of the countries now affected, the best we can do is to follow all precautions diligently.

In the Philippines, thousands of police and soldiers started sealing the densely populated capital from most domestic travelers in one of Southeast Asia 's most drastic containment moves.Meanwhile, China, where the virus first appeared late last year, continued to relax its drastic restrictions, illustrating the way the center of gravity in the crisis has shifted westward toward Europe. The virus has infected more than 150,000 people worldwide and killed over 5,600.In a nationally televised address Saturday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez detailed the battery of exceptional measures put in place as part of a two-week state of emergency to fight the sharp rise in infections.Later Saturday, Spain's government said Sanchez's wife has tested positive for coronavirus. Begona Gomez and the prime minister are in good health, the government said.Two ministers of Sanchez's Cabinet, the minister of equality and the minister of regional affairs, had already tested positive earlier this week. The others member of the Cabinet have tested negative.In a lockdown similar to the one already imposed in Italy, people will be allowed to leave their homes only to buy food and medicine, commute to work, go to hospitals and banks, or take trips related to the care of the young and the elderly. All schools and universities were closed, along with restaurants, bars, hotels and other non-essential retail businesses.""From now we enter into a new phase,"" Sanchez said after a Cabinet meeting that lasted over seven hours.

For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover in a matter of weeks.Despite please for calm from authorities, shoppers packed supermarkets in Spain in the morning.

Many Italian cities, including Rome and Milan, decided to close playgrounds and parks, too.Premier Giuseppe Conte has said production, particularly of food and health supplies, must not stop. On Saturday, union and industrial leaders reached an agreement to keep factories running.At noon, people around Italy came out on their balconies, terraces or gardens or leaned out their windows to clap for several minutes in a gesture of thanks to medical workers.In Britain, the death toll nearly doubled from the day before to 21, and the number of people infected rose to over 1,100.

Travelers will be turned away at the border if they are unable to show that they have ""a legitimate reason"" to enter, for example, if they are Danish citizens or residents.Poland planned to close is borders at midnight and deny all foreigners entry unless they lived in Poland or had personal ties there.

COIMBATORE: A software developer stranded in Italy returned home on Saturday morning after several phone calls, detailed planning and three flights.

While the Centre was allowing Indians stranded in Italy to return with a Covid-19 negative certificate, Srinithin Jayabal was stuck in Rome as doctors refused to subject him to the test as he didn't show any symptoms.

He finally went to another European country, which he didn't wish to name, flew to Delhi and then took a third flight to Coimbatore. Jayabal describes his return to India at 1am on Saturday as an ""adventure"". He used his business contacts in Europe, including sources in the Vatican church, to find other European countries with almost no or a low number of Covid-19 cases. "" I confirmed that flights from that country were going to India daily. I then flew to that country from Rome on Friday and took a direct flight to New Delhi. I am relieved the immigration authorities here cleared my entry after a detailed check-up. They found me to be fine.""

Jayabal, however, has decided to quarantine himself for 14 days. The techie, who flew to Italy on February 26, was stranded there since Wednesday, when the country came under a lockdown. On Tuesday, the country recorded more than 10,000 Covid-19 cases. ""I was staying in a hotel. But the plight of many other Indians, including a pregnant woman with a child, was pathetic. They were in the airport for two days.""

What made the situation worse for Indians was shutting down of all consular services by the Indian embassy. ""As a result, there was no update or news for the stranded people from the hotline operator.""

On March 10, Jayabal and 15 other Indians were not allowed to board their flight to India by the Emirates authorities. The airline said the Indian government had instructed them not to allow Indian passport holders to return from Italy without Covid-19 negative certificates. ""Getting tested for the virus in Italy is not allowed without symptoms, because the hospitals are booked to capacity. So, it was impossible to get the certificate. My mails and tweets to the external affairs ministry yielded no response,"" said Jayabal describing the desperate times that he went through.

He also said that 10,000 postgraduate (PG) medical seats will be added across the country soon.

Heaping praise on PM Modi for his achievements, Shah who was the chief guest at convocation ceremony of AIIMS Rishikesh on Saturday, said, “About 157 medical colleges and 16 new AIIMS opened in the past six years under the aegis of PM Modi. Four medical colleges will see daylight in Uttarakhand , thanks to PM’s visionary approach.” At least 252 students of AIIMS-Rishikesh completed various graduate and postgraduate courses.

“We have 130 crore population which is also 130 crore-strong market. I appeal to all of you to stay here, make your career here and do research work here so that by 2030, India will have the maximum number of research papers published across the world,” Shah added.

The consumer affairs ministry said online food ordering and delivery services have increased during the last three years. “Some instances of sale of sub-standard food being delivered through online food delivery service platforms have come to notice of FSSAI. Whenever any [such] instance is received, the same is taken up with the commissioner of food safety of states/UTs. The Food Safety and Standards Act and Rules & Regulations framed thereunder have provisions to ensure food quality and hygiene,” the ministry said.

Most complaints lodged against e-commerce firms, House told

The ministry recently gave the details of complaints in response to a question in the Rajya Sabha .

The complaints were registered through the National Consumer Helpline set up by the government. The details accessed from NCH show that one-fourth of the 5.65 lakh complaints registered till January this year were related to e-commerce. In response to another question in the RS in December last year, the consumer affairs ministry had said that the top five firms against whom the maximum complaints were registered between April and September 2019 included two major ecommerce firms — Flipkart Internet Pvt Ltd and Amazon Seller Services Pvt Ltd.

The other three companies were from the telecom sector — Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone. NCH data also show that 18% of the complaints against e-commerce firms between April 2019 and January 2020 were related to no refund of paid amount and in 12% cases of wrong goods being delivered. According to a report, the maximum complaints were received from UP (14%), followed by Maharashtra (13%) and Delhi (11%).

478,['15/03/2020'],Corona threat could spark a mega recession,"We face the greatest medical-cum-economic crisis in history. Admit it or not, the coronavirus has already created a deep global recession. Even earlier, Europe and Japan verged on recession while Indian GDP growth had halved from its peak. This leaves little resilience to meet the coming hurricane.

Let’s hope the coronavirus will not be as bad as the Spanish flu that infected 200 million and killed 50 million in 1918-19 — more than all combat deaths in World War I. No vaccine or cure existed for Spanish flu, just as there is none for the coronavirus. It will keep spreading till it naturally dies out like other epidemics.

In the best-case scenario, the virus may last one quarter. Lakhs of individuals and businesses will die, but many economies could revive by end 2020. In this best-case scenario, the world and India will suffer a short, serious but not catastrophic recession.

In the worst-case scenario, the virus will spread havoc for a year. In that extreme case, billions may get infected and tens of millions may die. However, most experts predict just 0.5 million deaths. Still, the economic disruption will be enormous, possibly as bad as in 2008.

Most analysts have focused, rightly, on the human tragedy. But the economic consequences may be as bad. The first-round effects are already clear. When China locked down Hubei province, the source of the virus, this disrupted global value chains in industrial production, especially electronics and pharma. The world prepared for a trade shock. India restricted the export of some medicines to avert shortages. The OPEC agreement fell apart and the price of oil crashed, threatening the oil and associated industries including automobile, especially small players.

Then came massive strangulation of activity by governments to quell the virus. Movement was slashed or banned in entire countries starting with Italy. The US banned visitors from 26 European countries, and will surely expand the list. India stopped visas to tourists and automatic clearance for NRIs. Country after country is enforcing isolation.

Mass meetings of all sorts — the Tokyo Olympic Games, IPL in India, football World Cup, National Basketball in the USA and other sports spectaculars have been or will soon be cancelled. Entertainment and restaurants have been vivisected: New York has closed down Broadway shows. In many countries, the assembly of over 100 people is being limited or forbidden. This may look like panicky overkill, but no government wants to be accused of letting people die.

India teems with festivals and pilgrimage sites where lakhs participate. Vaishno Devi, Triveni, Tirupati and other sites get millions of pilgrims a year. Will the government close them all, or let them become hubs of killer infection? What about Durga Puja, Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi and other mass festivals? Official bans will be politically difficult, and impossible to implement. Lesson: India is a major global risk centre. Hopes that high Indian temperatures will kill the virus look exaggerated — tropical Singapore and the Philippines are already victims.

Shutdowns and lockdowns will wreck industries galore — airlines, road and rail transport, films, music, sports, advertising, media (which depend on advertising), shopkeepers and hawkers, tourism, and many more. If consumers cut consumption by no more than 5% to avoid infection, that will suffice for a world recession.

Consumer durables are highly vulnerable since people can easily put off their purchases. For safety, people will go out less, shop less, and stay home watching TV and video. This crash in activity will affect every nook and corner of the economy. The recession that follows can cause thousands of bankruptcies (oil-related sectors look riskiest) that may make recent years look like a picnic. Corporate debts have stayed high after 2008, so the global and Indian financial systems are again in danger, even as they struggle to throw off the bad loans and mega-losses of the past.

Millions will avoid going to work because of fear, bad health or lack of transport. This worker shortage will hit the supply of services and goods.

Conventional recessions can be tackled by loose fiscal and monetary policy. These will not work when fear drives the slowdown. In many countries interest rates are already close to zero, so central banks have lost their power to stimulate through big rate cuts. The RBI could cut interest rates by as much as 2%, but will that revive lending when recession and fear are killing businesses? The moribund financial system will blunt all fiscal and monetary initiatives.

Governments the world over will let fiscal deficits explode to stimulate spending. In a best-case scenario, we will fall hard but rise again by end 2020. A worst-case scenario is too scary to even contemplate.",home,https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/swami_S.jpg,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/headlines/blog-corona-threat-could-spark-a-mega-recession/articleshow/74633475.cms

Stuck in cities that are completely locked out, many are homesick and waiting to return.Residential and travel restrictions imposed across several universities in the US saw unsure Indian origin students grappling with fastpaced changes. Labelling their furniture and moving them to large common storage rooms, returning their keys and suddenly hunting for a space to live in has not been easy on them.Amidst all that, hope and help has come from Indians in the US. Ashok Kolla, chairman TEAM Square of the Telugu Association of North America said, “We have helped 24 students find accommodation after their universities asked them to leave campus. These include students from Ohio, Atlanta and California.” Kolla added that the stranded students had been put up at motels run by Indians free of cost. Also, a few Indian families have come forward to take them home.A graduate student from Bengaluru, who is currently pursuing a certificate course to get into an MBA programme at Babson College , Wellesley, Boston, confirmed that international students had been asked to leave campus. “I live outside campus and hence, was not affected.”Rao Maddukkuri, whose son Akhil is in the third year of his undergraduate course in management sciences engineering at Stanford University , said officials had advised international students to leave, but those who could not were being allowed to stay on.Kolkata-based Dr Sabyasachi Mitra, whose son studies computer engineering at Purdue University, is very anxious. “My son, Rishi, wanted to return. However, I asked him to stay back.

Mohammad Wasim, 25, a labourer from Manjit Colony of Tibba road, claimed that Rohit had snatched his debit card on February 28 when he was going to withdraw cash from the SBI ATM on Tibba road.

Wasim said as he had written the PIN number of his debit card, the accused managed to withdraw Rs 17,500 from his account. On Friday evening, he saw the accused on Tibba Road and ran after him to catch hold of him. On raising an alarm, the onlookers helped him nab Rohit. Thereafter, he called up cops.

ASI Vinod Kumar, investigating officer from Tibba police station, said a case under Section 379-B (snatching) and 380 (theft) of the IPC has been registered against the accused. The police have seized 21 more debit cards from his possession, which he had snatched from people.

Students lost time in the process and also faced problem in writing their answers.

Importantly, the school did not have any power back-up. The controller of the examination has now sought a report in the matter from the district education officer.

A student, who appeared in the examination, said they had examination of social studies in which 246 students had appeared. He said the examination started at 9am and power went off around 10.30 am.

“As there was no arrangement of a generator at the school, the examination staff didn’t know what to do as there was darkness even after opening the windows and doors. Later, they brought candles which were placed on every third or fourth bench,” said the student.

“As arrangement for candles took time, I couldn’t write answers of all the questions and could attempt questions of 40 marks out of total 70 marks. Almost all students suffered because of power cuts,” the student added.

Another student said it was the duty of the authorities to make necessary arrangement in view of weather disturbance, but they failed to do so. “Because of the inefficiency of examination staff, we had to suffer. I had worked hard for this examination, but now I fear that my whole year’s efforts will go in vain,” the student added.

Sources said there was little visibility in four rooms of the school where the examination was being held. They added that the controller of the examination, principal of the school, had made efforts to get a generator on rent, but failed to do so.

Superintendent of examination Sarabjit Singh did not answer questions of the mediapersons. He just said it is the controller who has to make arrangements for power back-up and not him.

Controller of examination, PSEB, Janak Raj said he has sought a report from the DEO.

Meanwhile, a social activist from Machhiwara Shiv Kumar Shivli said as there was no electricity in Machhiwara because of rain, it was the duty of the examination staff to make proper arrangements for students especially so when their whole year is at stake. He said on the one hand, the government speaks of making education system smart, but on the other, the authorities have failed to even ensure basic facilities.

There is high risk that these orders may be cancelled.

Ludhiana-based companies said there is uncertainty over future orders too as overseas buyers will not be unable to travel to India to check the samples of garments or finalise orders as India has barred entry of foreigners into India till April 15.

In view of such a scenario, Ludhiana garment exporters have either curtailed or halted their production. According to industrialists, if the situation does not improve soon, they will suffer unprecedented losses in the coming days.

Munish Dua, managing director of KG Overseas, said, “The major buyers of our garment products belong to France and other neighbouring countries. Due to spread of coronavirus in Europe, the situation has turned worse as our buyers in the European countries have put their existing orders on hold. They have asked us not to dispatch goods as there has been huge fall in the sales due to very less turnout of customers in markets.”

“In Italy, which is also big market for garments, there is complete shutdown of malls and shops in view of spread of coronavirus. A number of garment importers have cancelled their orders,” Dua added.

According to Dua, in view of travel ban imposed by India on foreigners, overseas buyers who were to visit the city to check new samples and finalise new orders have cancelled their trip due to which future orders are at risk. “So, we have now cut our production by half. And if the same situation continues like this, we will be forced to stop production completely.”

Harish Kairpal, leading garment exporter and finance secretary of Knitwear Club, said, “Spread of coronavirus in Europe has become a big headache for Ludhiana-based garment exporters, as countries like Italy, Spain, France and Germany are big markets. If the situation remains same in April, it is certain that garment exporters of Ludhiana will suffer losses worth crores of rupees. As of now we can only wish that the situation in Europe turns normal soon.”

Narinder Mittal, another garment exporter from the city, said, “We have cut down our production by half as several of our buyers based in Spain and France have put their existing orders on hold. European buyers are now seeking more time to make payment of the already dispatched shipments due to the current situation and we are left with no other option but to accept their demand.”

486,['15/03/2020'],"Auto-part manufacturers seek freight subsidy, GST reimbersement","Ludhiana: Concerned over the rising difference between the cost of production with their competitors in other states, city-based manufacturers, especially from the auto-part sector, are demanding that the state government should announce perks like freight subsidy and reimbursement of GST to micro and small scale industry. According to businessmen, such steps will help them become more competitive and register boost in sales.

According to G S Kahlon, president of Auto Parts Manufacturers Association, “The cost of production of auto parts in Punjab is very high as compared with other states and the situation is becoming worse with each passing day. Various factors like high cost of power, labour and raw material as compared to states like Haryana, Gujarat, Rajasthan, etc are slowly putting us out of competition with the manufacturers in these states. It is our request to the government to provide special package to the small industry, which is earning livelihood only by local sales within India.”

“The package should include incentives like reimbursement of certain amount of GST, both state and centre. Besides this, if the government cannot lower the rate of power to the industry, it should provide subsidy on our power bills. Such steps will not only help us regain the lost ground but will also boost our sales by a huge percentage,” Kahlon said.

Speaking to TOI, Akshay Saluja, garment manufacturer, said, “Our industry is already out of competition with our counterparts based in places like Tirupur. The major reasons for such a scenario is that our cost of production is very high as compared to the manufacturers based in other states. This clubbed with the present recession in the market is turning out to be nothing less than a big blow for us. If nothing is done urgently by the state government, we will be left with no option except either shifting our factories to other states or shut these down.”

“The government should take corrective measures, at least by reimbursing us the cost of freight incurred on purchasing raw material from other states. This step alone can make a huge difference and presently, it is available only for a few industrial units. So, this should be extended to all small-scale units.”

According to Inderjit Singh Navyug, former president of the United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association, “If the state government cannot do much, it should at least reduce the power rates, which was their promise in the election manifesto. If power rates are reduced for the industry, it will lead to reduction of our cost of production, which in turn can make a huge difference for us and give us an edge to face our competitors.”

Due to water-logging, they were finding it difficult to avoid potholes on roads and faced difficulty in driving. Though municipal corporation officials had got patch work done on some roads, due to frequent rainfall the patch work also got damaged. The officials blamed the bad weather conditions for damage to roads.

Since Saturday morning, continuous rainfall was witnessed which resulted in water-logging in many areas, including Haibowal, Hambran Road, Chandigarh Road, Jassian Road and many stretches of the national highway. Potholed-roads troubled residents in Civil Lines, Chuharpur Road, Civil City, Chander Nagar, Model Town, Model Town Extension, Naveen Nagar, Maya Nagar, etc.

Congress worker Parminder Mehta while mentioning about the potholed roads said due to untimely rain the patch work done recently had got damaged and it had also exposed the poor quality material being used in construction of roads. He asked mayor Balkar Sandhu for constituting a committee for conducting checking of the material used in the repair of roads. He said the civic body was already facing tough time due to paucity of funds and officials were not paying attention towards quality work. He demanded strict action against such corrupt officials after an inquiry.

A resident of Civil City, Krishan Sharma, said the roads were actually in a pathetic condition and due to rainfall the situation had turned worst. He said there was need to find an alternative for bitumen roads and instead of using bitumen, cemented or some other material for roads should be used.

Meanwhile, the mayor said water-logging was at scattered locations as water on most of the roads got cleared quickly. However, he admitted that there were potholes on roads but he claimed that as soon as the weather would improve they would start repairing/recarpeting roads in the city.

They will have to bear the same conditions as the Met department has predicted cloudy weather for two more days in the city.

Even as it was sunny for major part of the day on Friday, weather on Saturday surprised the residents as it was cloudy in the morning and later it rained intermittently throughout the day. As per the Met department, rainfall in the city from 8.30pm on Friday to 8.30am on Saturday was recorded at 0.5mm whereas it was 1mm between 8.30am and 5.30pm on Saturday.

On Friday, the day temperature in Ludhiana was recorded at 25.2 degrees Celsius, which was a degree less than normal.

495,['15/03/2020'],"No drop, Himachal Pradesh decides to raise liquor prices","Representative image

SHIMLA: After withdrawing the Cabinet decision to reduce liquor price to curb its smuggling from neighbouring states, the BJP government in Himachal Pradesh will make liquor costlier from the next financial year. In a written reply to a question, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur informed the state assembly that a slight increase in liquor price would be made.

In response to a question by opposition leader Mukesh Agnihotri, Jai Ram Thakur said liquor vends in the state would not be auctioned in 2020-21as the government has adopted a policy for their renewal. Liquor vends which are not renewed would be allotted through the lottery system and the ones left out would be allotted through auction, bidding or tendering process.

For 2020-21, a total of 1,899 liquor vends have been proposed in the state. The government has not taken any decision to keep liquor vends, ahatas and restaurants open late into the night. In 2018-19, the state had 1,865 liquor vends and in 2019-20, there were 1,920 vends.

On February 17, the Himachal cabinet approved the excise policy for 2020-21 which envisaged collection of Rs 1,840 crore revenue during the year. This was Rs 215 crore higher than 2019-20, registering an increase of 13%.

The cabinet also approved renewal of retail excise vends in the state for 2020-21 to enhance government revenue, reduce liquor price and curb its smuggling from neighbouring states.

Congress leaders targeted the BJP government on the decision to make liquor cheaper in Himachal Pradesh on the grounds that this would encourage alcohol consumption, especially among the youth. Questioning the decision of the state government to make liquor cheaper and to keep bars open till 2am, Mukesh Agnihotri asked who advised round the clock availability of liquor. He was participating in the discussion on motion of thanks to the governor’s address on February 27. Agnihotri accused the government of trying to transform Himachal from Devbhoomi to Thailand or Bangkok and demanded roll-back of the decision.

In the face of stiff resistance from the opposition Congress, the cabinet, in its meeting held a few days back, rolled back the decision of making liquor cheaper in the state and to keep bars open till 2 am.

PATIALA/BATHINDA/FEROZEPUR: Three days of rain and hail damaged and flattened the wheat crop across Punjab, said agriculture officials and farmers on Saturday.

The government is yet to order a girdwari (assessment) to check the extent of damage and decide on compensation for farmers. In Ropar, nearly 20% of the crop has been damaged. The district’s chief agriculture officer (CAO), Avtar Singh, said the area comprised 18,000 hectares.

In Patiala district, of 2.32 lakh hectares over which the crop is sown, wheat on 3,570 hectares has been damaged, said Patiala CAO Surjeet Singh Walia. He said reports of crop damage had been sent to higher authorities.

Fatehgarh Sahib CAO Inderpal Singh Sandhu said the crop damage ranged between 4% and 14% in the district, and over 15,000 hectares of agriculture land had been affected. He said wheat accounted for 90% of crops grown over 84,000 hectares in the district. “Khamano and Bassi Pathana blocks have been badly affected by hailstorm in comparison to other districts. There was 11.12 mm rainfall on Friday and 21.5 mm on Saturday. If rain continues, losses will increase,” Sandhu said.

In Mansa and Bathinda districts, rain flattened the wheat crop, but there were no reports of damage.

Damage from the inclement weather has led to farm bodies seeking compensation from the government. BKU Dakaunda Punjab general secretary Jagmohan Singh claimed that losses had crossed more than 30% for wheat crop and the figure was 70% in case of vegetables. “The government should compensate farmers. When girdawari is ordered, officials do not collect the ground report. They should make field visits to get a clear picture of the losses,” he said.

On Saturday, Anandpur Sahib division received 15mm rain and Ropar division 8mm.

In Ferozepur and Fazilka districts, rain and hail damaged wheat, whole gram and mustard crops, and kinnow orchards.

In Fazilka, the worst-hit villages included Kallerkhera, Khuiya Sarver, Tajpatti, Panjkois, Maujgarh, Panjawa, Gumjal, Danewala, Satkosi, Haripura and Sayedwala, where wheat crop on thousands of acres has been flattened by hailstorm and stromy winds, said a farmer. An official said they were expecting damage to be at least 6-7% of the crop.

Owing to rain last year, kinnow growers had already suffered because of fruit dropping. “The supply of kinnow to the national capital and other states had already been hit due to riots in Delhi. Now, when time had come to market the produce, inclement weather has dashed the hopes of many,” said Krishan Godhara, a fruit grower.

Keeping in view of the prevalent damage to the crops and orchards, PPCC President, Sunil Jakhar had already asked the Punjab Chief Minister, Captain Amrinder Singh to envisage special scheme to compensate loss to the orchards and crops due to hailstorm and strong winds which had wreck havoc on the standing wheat crops and Kinnow orchards in Fazilka district. Punjab former Deputy Chief Minister amd MP from Ferozepur Lok Sabha seat, Sukhbir Singh Badal had also demanded special gridwari of the crops loss due to rains and hails in the region.
