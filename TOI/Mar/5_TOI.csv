0,['5/03/2020'],Bengaluru students forge their identities with the class sweatshirt,"College life is not only about academics and extra-curricular activities and making friends forever, it is just as much about being able to preserve those memories with memorabilia. While the college magazine is one such, what also takes a pride of place in the collection are the hoodies, sweatshirts, jackets or even caps that have the institution’s name and the year of the batch (and course stream) emblazoned on it. What makes these wearable items even more special is that the onus of designing them for the year falls on the students. A sweatshirt, then, is no longer just a piece of clothing; it is an extension of their identity and something to remember the time spent in class with friends by.Designing a class hoodie or a sweatshirt , though, is about more than just putting the college logo on it. It is quite the process, which involves weeks of brainstorming, before the entire class gets to wear the final product. “Designing the sweatshirt for the class is an activity we look forward to, especially when we are in our final year. It is usually an elaborate process, because the whole class is involved in this. There are multiple steps. Right from choosing the colour scheme, material, design, logistics and everything else, there is a lot of brainstorming,” says B Shreyas Padmanabha Sharma, a final year student at St. Joseph’s College (Autonomous). Nischay, a final year student of NITTE Meenakshi Institute of Technology, says that since everyone is involved in the process, it helps create memories as well. “We divide the class into different groups — one takes care of the design, one handles logistics and such. Working together on something like this actually brings us together,” he says.Since a lot of detailing goes into designing the sweatshirt, it also gives rise to a lot of arguments and discussions. “When we sit down to design the logo, we want it to represent who we are — the class we belong to or the clubs we are members of. Everyone comes up with an idea for the logo and reaching a consensus is a major task. Another challenge that we face is the choice of colour. It is very difficult to find one that everyone agrees on. So, usually the discussions spill over after class and on our social media groups too,” says Shreyas.For Sanjana Karanam, a 2nd- year student from RV College of Engineering, the club sweatshirt or t-shirt is what holds more value. “We do not have a class sweatshirt. Instead, we have various clubs on campus and each club has a sweatshirt or a t-shirt of its own. For example, I am a part of the RVQuizCorp — a quiz club — and we have designed our sweatshirt and t-shirt as well. For us, these are like an extension of our identity on campus. People recognise us as being part of these clubs when we wear these, especially during college fests,” says Sanjana. Aman Singh, another student from the same college, shows off his Hindi theatre group sweatshirt and explains, “Since we are into street plays and theatre, our club sweatshirt reads ‘Loud By Choice’. We designed the logo in such a way that it brings out the true essence of our club, which is why we have half face as part of the logo.”Assigning tasks during the process too is crucial. “We assign the tasks to students who we know can handle the job. For example, someone who is good at drawing and has a sense of visuals will take up designing the logo. Anyone with a business acumen is tasked with working out the cost with the vendor or buying the raw material in bulk,” says Rajat Keshri, a 2nd-year student from RV College of Engineering.Such is the sense of pride that a class sweatshirt evokes that it is not only the current batch of students, but alumni too who sport it every time they are back on campus. “Our recently concluded fest was attended by a lot of our alumni and they all wore their sweatshirts. It just goes to show how important the sweatshirt is, and makes it easy for them to spot batchmates and for us to find seniors in attendance,” says Sanjana.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74475852,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-248206/74475852.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/bengaluru-students-forge-their-identities-with-the-class-sweatshirt/articleshow/74475852.cms

Path ahead: Adline wants to emulate Lara’s feat

For LIVA Miss Diva Universe 2020 Adline Castelino , the last few days have been nothing short of magical. After her win, she was welcomed back at home in Mangaluru and Udupi like a princess. From innumerable number of selfies to gorging on her favourite food while catching up with family, to the trip culminating with a pitstop in Bengaluru and a visit to meet the Chief Minister of Karnataka, Adline says that the memories will remain priceless.“It was a grand welcome back home, I’d never expected anything like this. People came in such large numbers to celebrate my victory. I got to spend time at home with my mum, who flew in from Kuwait after four years, just to be with me. I also got to spend time with my sister and all my relatives,” says Adline.She also tells us that this time around, she was able to visit a lot of her favourite places in Mangaluru, after a long time. She visited her family church as well as one of her favourite Krishna temples in Mangaluru. “I also got to savour a lot of my favourite things on this trip, which included gudbud , the ice cream that I’ve feasted on since I was a child. At home, we even had our traditional meal on banana leaf, and the best part about that was the payasam made by my mother,” she adds.“It has been a delightful experience to meet the Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa. It is an experience that I will cherish my entire life. I got the opportunity to speak to him about the issues that farmers face. It is a cause that he has extensively worked with and it is a cause I am passionate about, and am working towards. I am grateful that he took the time off to talk about this — because these issues really matter,” says Adline.Adline feels the work begins now. “We are going to start preparing for Miss Universe. It has been 20 years since Lara Dutta ma’am won the Miss Universe pageant. She is from Karnataka. And now, we have gotten the opportunity to bag the Miss Universe title again,” she says, adding, “There is a lot of work to be done and I am really excited about it.

2,['5/03/2020'],Nazriya: I’m now clear on what kind of films I want to be part of,"Cute, bubbly, girl next door. No longer. That’s probably what Nazriya Nazim proved with her latest outing as the alcohol-swilling, weed-smoking Esther Lopez in Anwar Rasheed 's Trance . It was a breakaway from the roles that she is best known for in films such as Ohm Shanti Oshana and Bangalore Days. In a candid chat, the actress talks to us about her biggest worry playing Esther, working with husband Fahadh and if she misses the process of doing back-to-back films.Everything that you see onscreen. I think that’s what appealed to me to do this. And I haven’t played such a character before. So, there was that curiosity on how the role would turn out if I play it. I think that’s also one of the reasons why Anbukka (Anwar Rasheed) wanted me to do the role. Anbukka took the risk and it wasn’t easy for him. Frankly, it’s also the first time that someone has approached me to do a character like this. It’s not like I took a decision that I won’t play such roles.The time I was mostly active was during those two years, and back then I was really busy to entertain such thoughts. And there was so much love from the audience for my roles, and I didn’t go through that phase where I had to think about that.More than the character, it was her habits that I was more worried about. I wanted to get those right before we started shoot – be it smoking or drinking. I didn’t want to look like an actor who had no idea about these when she was playing a chain-smoker and an alcoholic. We had already decided on Esther’s look, so I had to get that right too. But apart from these, there weren’t any other preparations. Everything else was done on the set.Yes, at different points. Fahadh was involved in the film, much before I was approached to do a role. So, I was in the loop about the discussions and the story before I became part of the film. I always knew that feel of the movie and what they were trying to do with Trance, because obviously we live in the same house.I think he is. He is totally with the film till it is over. He works on his character every day even after coming home. Trance, especially, had a lot of dialogues including Bible verses and he was completely involved in it.Being an actor, it’s kind of an inspiration to be around him. His dedication and hard work for each and every film pushes me too. He has always been supportive. There has never been a discussion on whether I should or shouldn’t do films. There was a time after our wedding when I had lazy days and he would say, ‘You should listen to scripts. Entha madiyaayo?’Being there and seeing the process. It was unlike any other film I did. To be part of a movie with such great names, irrespective of the length of the character, was a big deal.I have been waiting for roles, that’s how I have worked.I do, sometimes. But I am very clear on what kind of films I want to do and what characters I want to play. I have that clarity now.The biggest change would be social media. It has become crazy now. There are so many ways to put out your film and promote it. It has become easier and better, but at the same time you must be careful. Anything happening behind the scenes comes out instantly. We are also at a good space and amazing content is being made.We were all aware that it had a sensitive subject. But we were very sure that we haven’t tried to hurt any faith in particular or we aren’t blaming everyone for these acts. We were trying to show something that was actually happening. We were ready to take that risk and go ahead.These movies are all baby steps for that (laughs). Let’s see when it happens.I realise that there has been a gap between my films only when people tell me that. That’s because we are either producing a film or listening to scripts. So, I have always thought that I have been part of cinema. Otherwise we are at home or we travel whenever we can.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74475095,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-40707/74475095.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/nazriya-im-now-clear-on-what-kind-of-films-i-want-to-be-part-of/articleshow/74475095.cms

4,['5/03/2020'],"No songs, no fights in Vijay Suriya’s next film","There’s nothing ‘formulaic’ about TV star turned film actor Vijay Suriya ’s next big screen outing. “It’s probably the state of mind that I am in right now that made me accept this film. The subject explores the life of an IT guy and the changes that he goes through with each significant situation in his life. Personally, from a singleton, to a married man last year, and turning father recently, I could relate to the metamorphosis of the protagonist’s life and that stayed with me,” shares Vijay, who amidst his TV outings has gone about shooting for an upcoming film. Made by a team of newcomers, all working full-time in the IT sector, the yet-untitled film is being directed by Chethan Shetty and is being filmed at an IT firm in Bellandur . “The highlight is that it is not your regular masala flick and steers clear of cliches, song, dance and fights. The screenplay is the movie’s biggest draw,” shares Vijay. But he has chosen to imbibe one mass element into this film. “The team had suggested another name for the character, but I asked if they could change it to Siddharth — my character’s name from Agnisakshi; as people instantly connect to it,” he tells us. “Besides, I also handle the camera at work sometimes, because I love exploring and learning about the technical aspects of filmmaking .

But it took 40 years for the veteran actress, a known name in the film and theatre circuit of the country, to return to Marathi cinema . The Padma Shri awardee will soon be seen in Mohit Takalkar ’s directorial debut, Medium Spicy, in a special appearance. Arundhati, who has acted in multiple languages and has been part of Hindi films like Dil Se and Paa as well, will play the role of Laxmi Tipnis in the Marathi film. “Coming back to Marathi cinema after 40 years feels good. It’s a complete circle and yet, I feel almost like starting afresh as a debutant. I have seen Mohit’s plays at Ranga Shankara , in Bengaluru, and during one of the shows, he sat next to me and asked. ‘Aru Akka, I am planning to direct a film soon. There’s a role I would like you to do. Would you be a part of it?’,” reminisces Arundhati, who is all praises for her co-actor Lalit Prabhakar . She adds, “The script and a character description was sent to me, but magic happened when I reached the set and read the lines with my co-actor, Lalit. I feel he suits the role to the T and transforms into his character effortlessly.”On his part, Mohit shares that the dynamic character of Laxmi could’ve only been pulled off by Arundhati. Mohit added, “I know her since the last 15-20 years and she is a multi-faceted performer. She willingly came on board and I am happy about that.

Close on the heels of countries going on high alert because of the Coronavirus (COVID-19), Bengaluru too seems to be well on its toes when it comes to the prevention and spread of the virus. BT finds out how the city is gearing up to fight the fatal virus.In the wake of the coronavirus scare, city colleges are looking at cancelling all scheduled official trips for students and teachers for the time being. “We have created awareness among teachers and mentors who are keeping a close watch on students. There is a student’s trip to Ramanagara scheduled this week, but this will most likely be cancelled,” says Lekha George, professor, Department of Botany at Mount Carmel College. At St. Joseph’s College (Autonomous) has introduced soap dispensers and hand sanitisers in all the restrooms on campus. “We don’t want anyone to panic, we are disseminating correct information among students and the administration,” says Kiran Jeevan, the PRO for the college.With health experts stating that the COVID-19 will probably become endemic soon, corporate houses in Bengaluru are taking extra measures to ensure employee safety. “We had a workshop on everything that we need to know about coronavirus wherein medical experts were called in to impart the required information about the virus,” informs Sangeeta Bora, of Ness Digital Engineering. An employee from Siemens informs that, “We have received a Corona safety booklet from the company which tells us about the virus and how it is best to avoid crowds contact with people who seem to be ill.” Many companies (especially those within the vicinity of the company where Bengaluru’s first and lone case till now was reported) have asked employees to work from home.Companies like Capgemini and Western Digital confirm that their upcoming meetings that required them to travel have been put on hold for now. “We have not restricted our travel itinerary to all countries as of now, but we are avoiding travel to countries that have reported deaths and have an endemic-likesituation. We are looking at having our meetings over video calls instead,” explains Sangeeta Bora, of Ness Digital Engineering.With crucial annual exams scheduled to take place all this month, authorities at education boards inform that circulars on precautionary measures have been sent out to students, teachers and parents. “Students suffering from cold, cough and fever will need to wear masks at the examination hall.

The Waaris serial fame actress on Tuesday went on a spiritual sojourn in the city. “I had really wished to earn a name for myself in the industry. This is what I had always asked lord Shiva for and so when my Bigg Boss journey ended, I made sure to take time out and come to Lucknow so that I can visit my favourite temple Mankameshwar,” said Arti, who also went to Deva Sharif Dargah on Monday.Arti Singh offering prayers at Mankameshwar Temple (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal)She added, “I have been coming to this temple since childhood with my mom.

I will be coming again to do the shringar of Lord Shiva.”Later, Arti also went to the Hanuman Setu temple. “This Hanuman Setu temple visit was something my bhabhi had wished for me. She was praying for my success all this while when I was inside the Bigg Boss house. I am really blessed to have such a loving family,” smiled Arti.A complete foodie, the Parichay actress then went to have the famous basket chaat of Lucknow. “There is no doubt about this that I love eating good food. Aate hi maine apni bhabhi ke haath ka khana khaya. She really cooks well. I missed Lucknow ki chaat badly inside the house, and so I planned to come here to Hazratganj to eat the basket chaat. I know it is really heavy and is equivalent to one whole meal, but I just can't resist it. Honestly speaking, meri aatma taras gayi thi Lucknow ki chaat ke liye. In fact, jaise hi main Lucknow pahunchi, my family and friends teased me saying ki ab toh tu chaat khaane jayegi zaroor.”Wrapping up her trip to Luckow, Arti then went to a famous chikan shop in Hazratganj to purchase some colourful clothes for Holi. “I have a huge collection of chikan stuff in Mumbai. I really love wearing chikan clothes. So since I was here before Holi, I thought of taking some stuff for the Holi parties,” said she.Arti, who loves Lakhnawi chaat, feasted on it (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal)Ask Arti about her journey inside the Bigg Boss house and she says, “I am really happy with my Bigg Boss journey. My journey inside the reality show was full of ups and downs and it was because of me as I am an emotional person. At times I used to lose my patience and felt like running from the house. But then I used to calm myself down and think that getting hyper will not be of any help to me. Also, for me Bigg Boss was my last chance to prove myself in the industry. In the beginning of my journey, I lacked confidence, I also got a panic attack. And after that attack, I realized that now everything about me is revealed, what else is left for the viewers to watch. That attack motivated me and helped me get going ahead inside the house. Later, I knew that I was the best and no one can compete with me in the house.” She added, “The perception of people has changed after I came out of the Bigg Boss house. People, who thought that probably I am capable of doing nothing in life, now are proud of me. I am getting so much love from the people after the show.”The actress also says that she was very conscious of the image she portrayed while inside the house. “I was image-conscious inside the house. I restrained myself from getting into any sort of controversies. People had several misconceptions in their mind regarding me and Sidharth Shukla . They had already linked both of us together that ‘Arti Singh is dating Sidharth.’ So at that point, I did not give any clarifications and thought that people would eventually come to know about my relationship status with Shukla, and within two weeks it was clear that there is nothing between the two of us. I did not pay much heed to the controversies surrounding me. But yes I was image-conscious as I was under a lot of pressure when I entered the Bigg Boss house. I belong to a family of stars and my mother wants me to get married and if I had given in to controversies so who would agree to marry me?”She went shopping for Holi and bought chikan kurtas for herself (BCCL/ Vishnu Jaiswal)Talking about her most memorable moments and worst ones inside the house, Arti said, “There is not one but three best memories of the house which I will cherish for life. The first was when everyone inside the house voted against me and then I was made the captain of the house. The second one which gave me a lot of strength inside the house was when Asim (Riaz) gave me a handwritten letter from my mother during a task giving away his option to become a captain. And last and not the least is when my brother Krushna Abhishek paid me a visit inside the house with the kids and later Kashmira also joined in. It really boosted my self-confidence.”Ask her if she thinks Sidharth deserved to be the winner and Arti says, “As far as I have seen, the craze of the people inside the house, everyone was in favour of Sidharth. Then slowly the craze shifted to Asim Riaz . After seeing the fondness of the people, even I thought that Sidharth will definitely emerge as the winner and for the female winner I had solid vibes that probably I might win the trophy. But, I really feel that since I was not declared the winner so I hardly care whether Sidharth won it or not. I knew he would win and may the best person win that was the situation at that time. And if I have not won then how do things matter to me.”Arti, who played her second innings with Bigg Boss, has been quite vocal about getting married. “There is no hurry to get married, but I feel that there is always a time when things should happen. I have never been an ambitious person in life and abhi I need to earn a name for myself and jab tak kaam chal raha hai chalega. But as far as marriage is concerned, I want to get married and enjoy my life for two-three years and then have kids. I don’t want to get married late. I have always felt there is a right age to get married,” she said.Talk to her about her upcoming projects she revealed, “Talks are on for a film project which was offered to me recently. Plus, I want to do television and definitely a dance reality show. I am fond of dancing so I would love to do a dance reality show. And as far as films are concerned, it should be strong in terms of the content and script which should appeal to me.

I will be coming again to do the shringar of Lord Shiva.”Later, Arti also went to the Hanuman Setu temple. “This Hanuman Setu temple visit was something my bhabhi had wished for me.

20,['5/03/2020'],Kareena Kapoor Khan: You need to have a strong gut and be made of steel to survive for so long,"As she enters the third decade of her journey in Bollywood, she comes across as an actor who does not let success ride on her mind and failure sink her heart. Even when she’s not in couture, she’s the best-dressed woman in the room, who makes for a smart, on-point conversationalist. Kareena Kapoor Khan talks to BT about Angrezi Medium, what drives her movie choices today and how, over time, she has become a relaxed and calm actor. Excerpts:I agree that it’s a small role, but I’d never played something like this before. I was in London for two months with Saif (Ali Khan, husband) while he was shooting for Jawaani Jaaneman when this came my way. They needed about a fortnight of my time. It sounded like a cool film to be a part of. Also, who wants to miss a chance to work with such a fantastic cast. Most importantly, it was the greed to work with Irrfan that got me going instantly. The story draws parallels between Radhika Madan ’s relationship with Irrfan, and the one I share with Dimple Kapadia in the film, who is my mother. It subtly talks about the kind of equation parents and kids share. In the brief screen time I have, my character has a brilliant arc. I couldn’t have turned this down. I loved working with Irrfan, he’s such a delight. Radhika is fantastic, and I’ve been a huge fan of Deepak Dobriyal ’s work since Omkara (2006). He’s magical. These guys are on some other plane; you stop feeling like an actor when you see them work.Dimple aunty is close to my family, and she’s actually seen me grow up. It was an honour to work with her and play her daughter. She was spectacular to work with. The way we did some of the emotionally challenging scenes — they turned out to be among my career’s best shots. There’s a portion where she confronts me which was quite tricky to get right, but it went off so well. It takes a performer like her to make it that much more convincing. I think a director also has a lot to do with how two people play out scenes. He pushes them in a particular direction, like Homi did in our case. He had lived with this script for longer than us, and he was so sure of what he wanted.No, not really. Of course, we all invest a part of ourselves in the roles we play, but I would never compare my equation with Dimple aunty in the film with what I share with my mother. My mom is the centre of my sister Lolo’s ( Karisma Kapoor ) and my universe. Our world revolves around her. Today, being a mother, I know how important a mother is to a child’s being. Our role is not restricted to feeding and bathing the child. The effect a mother has on the mind of her child runs deep. If I don’t see Taimur for two days, I feel uneasy. Sometimes, I don’t take him along when I’m shooting outdoors in another city. When I come home, the way he hugs me says a lot. His father does a great job of looking after him when I’m away, but I can see it in his eyes that he has missed me. I know that it’s going to get difficult for me to stay away from him as he grows older and starts formal school. I still have a year before that happens. I’m happy that my next film Takht will be shot in Mumbai. Being able to be around Taimur plays a big part in the way I choose my work. I can’t leave him behind. I can’t be away from my kid for too long. Sometimes, even promotions for three to four days in other cities gets to me because he’s not around.Not at all! Saif and I have our independent relationships with Homi and Dinesh. Saif didn’t even come on the set when I was shooting for this film. In fact, when I told him about the offer, he just said that I should do it and that it sounds like a good role and a cool film. Saif is not someone who believes in telling me what I should do and what I shouldn’t. As long as we have our time as a family, he’s not interested in what I’m doing because he trusts that I will do the right thing. To this day, Saif has not even asked me how it was to work on this film. He just asked me, “Are you having fun? I said, ‘Yeah!” and he said, “Cool.” He does not get into the details, and we don’t talk about my career, anyway. Yes, we definitely discuss his career a lot. This has worked beautifully for us.It’s hard to believe, but there was no plan whatsoever to be seen as a glamourous woman, ever. It just happened! I started off with an unconventional love story and have always been that kind of an actress. Yes, now that it’s been 20 years, people are realising it. Early on in my career, I worked in films like Chameli (2003), Dev (2004) and Yuva (2004). Obviously, the commercial films were mounted bigger, and they registered better with the audience, so the image of a diva got associated with me. As an actor, I had always wanted to do different kinds of films and I chose the best of what was offered to me. Usually, no actress agrees or chooses to do the smaller part, but I was keen to do Angrezi Medium. A few months ago, I was also the central character in Good Newwz. It’s a conscious decision to find interesting things to do. Today, I’m a relaxed and calm actor. Experiences in this insular world of films teach you a lot. You need to have a strong gut and be made of steel to survive for so long and be able to take every bottle chucked at you. That is the reason I’ve lasted for 20 years, and hopefully, will last another 20.I’ve worked in many films that he has backed as a producer over these years, but not with him as a director. It’s been a huge gap. In these years, Karan has made such different kinds of films and has worked with so many different actors. Working together will be a rude shock for both of us. He has evolved as a filmmaker, and I’m a different actor from what I used to be when I had played Poo in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham. Takht, which is being directed by Karan, will be a different and a special journey for us. Also, it’s a drama set in the Mughal era and we are entering into such a space for the first time. Neither of us has done this before. He will leave no stone unturned to make an absolute spectacle. We’ve locked certain looks for the initial part of the shoot. I’ll also go in for diction training. If I were to ask Karan what I should do as prep for the part, he will pull my leg and say, “Since when have you become this sort of an actor?”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74479140,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-54002/74479140.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/kareena-kapoor-khan-you-need-to-have-a-strong-gut-and-be-made-of-steel-to-survive-for-so-long/articleshow/74479160.cms

23,['5/03/2020'],Delhi HC's adjournment of hate speech case unjustified: Supreme Court,"SG criticises ‘rushed’ hearing in HC

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Delhi high court to fast-track hearing on PILs seeking registration of FIRs against BJP functionaries Kapil Mishra , Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Verma for making allegedly inflammatory speeches, including “desh ke gaddaron ko...” slogans, which petitioners say went viral and caused riots in Delhi.Transferring a petition filed by riot victims led by Aurangabad-based Shaikh Mujtaba Farooq for hearing to the Delhi HC, with a request to hear it on Friday along with pending petitions adjourned to April 13, a bench of CJI S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant said, “We think adjournment for a long period was unjustified. But, at the same time, adhering to judicial discipline, we will not assume jurisdiction over the matter when the HC is already dealing with it.” It said, “Delhi HC is requested to dispose of the matters as expeditiously as possible on their own merits and in accordance with law. The HC may also explore the possibility of peaceful resolution of the subject dispute.” The riots claimed 47 lives. The order came after a 45-minute hearing before the bench that was keenly watched by lawyers from both sides.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for Delhi Police and Delhi government, criticised the rushed hearing before Delhi high court last month before a bench headed by Justice S Muralidhar , prior to his transfer to Punjab and Haryana high court. Later, a bench headed by Chief Justice D N Patel adjourned hearing to April 13.“We told the court that we have to go through 7,000 videos and over 1,000 speeches, which were inflammatory. We also told them that the situation is not conducive for registration of an FIR as we are trying to restore law and order and under the prevailing circumstances, we defer registration of FIRs against those who made inflammatory speeches,” the SG said.CJI Bobde asked, “Is the situation conducive today? Will you register the FIRs now?” This evoked laughter from a section of lawyers. An annoyed CJI said, “We will stop the hearing. It is a courtroom and not a meeting ground.” The SG replied, “There are inflammatory speeches from both sides. What the petitioners have done is to selectively cite certain speeches. If we had started registering FIRs against leaders of the community without bringing the law and order situation under control, it would have flared up.”Appearing for petitioners, senior advocate Colin Gonsalves said, “If they had arrested those who made inflammatory speeches that went viral leading to riots, the carnage in Delhi could have been stopped.” CJI Bobde said, “We have some experience of riots. Your (Gonsalves’s) statement is not always true. Speaking generally and without referring to the Delhi riots, we know from experience that sometimes when police arrests leaders, riots flare up. What happened in Mumbai riots? A few shakha pramukhs (Shiv Sena functionaries) were arrested and the riots flared up.”Gonsalves said, “When leaders stand next to police and say police are with them and they go scot free because of their proximity to the ruling party, situations flare up.” The CJI said, “These allegations can be established only after a thorough inquiry. What is the urgency today? As you admit, the objectionable slogans (desh ke gaddaron ko...) were first made on January 21, why didn’t you lodge an FIR then?”Gonsalves replied, “We didn’t think the slogan would go viral and cause riots. We thought it to be a political stunt. But we were demoralised by the HC adjourning the hearing to April 13. The high court took the same approach in police lathi charge on Jamia students. The court heard the case on December 19 and then adjourned it to February 2.”The SG said, “I was more than demoralised by the manner in which the high court conducted the hearing. I faced constant heckling by a section of lawyers present in the court during the hearing... We have registered 468 FIRs. And those who incited riots will also be brought to book.”",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74483844,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-573272,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delhi-hcs-adjournment-of-hate-speech-case-unjustified-sc/articleshow/74483843.cms
24,['5/03/2020'],Study flags reasons for women's dormant bank accounts,"NEW DELHI: Lack of capacity to operate their accounts, no regular cash flow and unease in dealing with male banking agents are some of the main reasons why a whopping 42% of bank accounts owned by women were found to be dormant, according to a research report prepared for Niti Aayog has found.

The research report by MicroSave Consulting was released on Wednesday. Quoting the global Findex report of 2017, the consulting firm said that nearly 65% Indian women either don’t have a bank account or have not transacted any business for over a year after opening them.

The research through detailed interviews was carried out to find the exact reason why nearly 23% didn’t or couldn’t open accounts despite the government’s big push under the flagship Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana and also why women were not using the accounts frequently.

The report has also highlighted how the share of women having accounts increased from barely 43% in 2014 to 77% in 2017 and the gender gap in financial inclusion reduced to only 14% within these four years.

It said in neighbouring countries like Bangladesh and Pakistan , the share of women having bank accounts was just 36% and 7% respectively.

MSC group managing director Graham A N Wright said that there is need to understand the complex gender issues that often limit the use of these accounts. “The banks and their agents need to devise new approach such as selling a package or new idea such as regular saving for daughter’s marriage or education rather than selling the proposal for recurring deposits. Engaging more women agents will also have greater positive impact on women to open and operate accounts,” he told TOI.

25,['5/03/2020'],"Cryptocurrency News: SC quashes RBI order, paves way for cryptocurrency trade","‘Daily trade in Indian crypto market averaged 150 crore in 2018’

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday quashed RBI’s 2018 circular preventing banking and financial institutions from providing services to any individual or business entities dealing in cryptocurrency or virtual currency, saying it was a disproportionate measure taken by the regulator.The verdict would allow companies in the sector to use the banking platform to trade and transact in cryptocurrency. The central bank had contended that allowing cryptocurrency (bitcoins) compromised the integrity of the banking system.A bench of Justices R F Nariman, Aniruddha Bose and V Ramasubramanian said while RBI had a special role in the economy and was empowered to take such decisions, it must pass the proportionality test in order to be valid. It said there was no evidence banking and financial sectors suffered any damage due to trading in and circulation of virtual currency. The SC noted prohibition of involvement of banking channels had crippled trade and exchange in virtual currency though there had been no ban as such on cryptocurrency.“I will have to go through the apex court order and then will probably meet you all to see what we want to do or how we look at the judgement,” finance minsiter Nirmala Sitharaman said.When the consistent stand of RBI is that they have not banned virtual currencies and when the Government of India is unable to take a call despite several committees coming up with several proposals including two draft bills, both of which advocated exactly opposite positions, it is not possible for us to hold that the impugned measure is proportionate,” said Justice Ramasubramanian while writing the 180-page verdict.“The position as on date is that VCs are not banned, but the trading in VCs and functioning of VC exchanges are sent to comatose by the impugned circular by disconnecting their lifeline namely, interface with the regular banking sector. What is worse is that this has been done (i) despite RBI not finding anything wrong about the way in which these exchanges function and (ii) despite the fact that VCs are not banned,” the judgement said.The crypto asset industry is estimated to have a market capitalisation of approximately $430 billion globally. India is estimated to contribute between 2-10% based on varied estimates. As per the petitioners who challenged RBI’s circular, the total number of investors in Indian crypto market was approximately 20 lakh and the daily trade volume averaged Rs 150 crore in 2018.The bench, however, said RBI has the power to put in place mechanism to regulate the VC sector and rejected the contention that the regulator’s role and power can come into play only if something has actually acquired the status of a legal tender.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74483920,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-416287,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sc-quashes-rbi-order-paves-way-for-cryptocurrency-trade/articleshow/74483927.cms

MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate detained Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal after long hours of questioning at its Ballard Estate office on Wednesday. Sources said the ED, which took him home in its car, was searching his SoBo house at the time of going to press. It has filed a money laundering case against him.

The agency has been probing Jet and Goyal under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema) and was considering filing a money laundering case. The ED, which is probing Jet’s financial deals of the last 12 years, has quizzed Goyal over a dozen times in the Fema case. It has also questioned his wife and son a couple of times. It is looking into suspicious transactions involving 19 privately held firms —14 registered in India and five abroad—associated with Goyal.

‘Naresh Goyal allegedly linked to firms in tax havens’

According to sources, Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal also allegedly indirectly controls other companies in tax havens. The grounded airline had allegedly diverted most of the Rs 8,000-crore loan secured from banks abroad by inflating payments and through fictitious transactions, officials said. Jet’s lenders, led by SBI, have initiated bankruptcy proceedings agai- nst the airline with the National Company Law Tribunal.

Recently, Mumbai police had registered a fraud case against Goyal on a complaint filed by a travel agency.

28,['5/03/2020'],China’s created aura of military might without combat: Army chief,"Army chief General MM Naravane

NEW DELHI: Indian armed forces are recalibrating their plans and capabilities for “dynamic responses” along the borders with China and Pakistan below the threshold of all-out wars, as shown during the Balakot air strikes last year, even as they strengthen their conventional military prowess, Army chief Gen M M Naravane said on Wednesday.

Militaries “play to the edge” in the “grey zone” now. China through its incremental moves in the contentious South China Sea, for instance, is altering geo-strategic realities in the region without firing a single shot or inviting any retaliatory action.

“China has not been involved in real, hardcore combat for a few decades now; yet the regular showcasing of its military might have created this aura of China being the undisputed military leader in key technological domains — with deterrence logic of its own,” he said.

India is boosting its power in space, cyber warfare: Army chief

For years we were told that if air power is used across the international border, it would lead to a full-fledged war. Balakot showed that if you play the escalatory game with skill, military ascendancy can be established in short cycles of conflict that do not necessarily lead to war,” Army chief Gen M M Naravane said at a seminar on the changing characteristics of warfare organised by the Centre for Land Warfare Studies.

Dwelling at length on the Chinese way of war epitomised by thinkers like Sun Tzu as well as the continuing relevance of Indian philosopher Chanakya’s famed treatise “Arthashastra”, he said his force is developing both “kinetic and non-kinetic responses” to address the threat of “non-contact or grey-zone warfare”, where ambiguity and careful risk escalation are key. India is strengthening its capabilities in space, cyber and electronic warfare, while also looking to tap blockchain technologies, lasers and directed energy weapons, he said.

“The Houthi rebels’ attack on Riyadh airport and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia and closer home, the Balakot air strike, saw these short, intense, escalatory cycles of military activity, in full media glare, where sophisticated information narratives played an equally important role,” said Gen Naravane.

Terming it a “technological irony”, he said the so-called Islamic State had shown it was far more adept in leveraging social media and digital technologies than the 21st-century militaries of the US and the UK. “The rise of non-state actors, such as insurgents, terrorists, transnational criminal networks combined with greater focus on an individual’s status consequently demands that victory needs to be formulated and achieved in a more nuanced way. Victory no longer rests on the ability to inflict massive destruction but on the ability to wrestle popular support from one’s opponent,” he said.

It staved off what CM Nath and his senior Congress colleague Digvijaya Singh dubbed a BJP attempt to topple the government by buying out ruling alliance MLAs.Six of the 10 ‘missing’ MLAs were back in the Nath fold by Wednesday afternoon. But four are still ‘missing’ and reported to be cooped up in bungalows in Whitefield, Bengaluru. All other ruling alliance MLAs are accounted for, says Congress. “My government has already proven majority four times in floor tests and defeated BJP. They will be defeated again,” Nath said. With two seats vacant, the House strength is 228, putting the majority mark at 115.Congress has 114 legislators. Even discounting the four missing MLAs, the Nath government is still comfortable with two BSP MLAs, an SP legislator and four independents. BJP, on the other hand, has 107 MLAs.It was a close call. Madhya Pradesh hasn’t seen such political drama in at least two decades. Sixteen hours of firefighting. Chartered planes criss-crossing like they were shuttles. Scuffles, apparently, at a star hotel in Gurgaon. And political heavyweights from both sides are going toe to toe.The political storm hit the MP government in the dead of night, around 1am on Wednesday, when reports surfaced of six, seven, eight (no one knew how many) Congress MLAs and allies cooped up at a hotel in Gurgaon. Congress alleged that the BJP was holding them there against their wish. Digvijaya turned up at the hotel but was allegedly not allowed to enter.The Congress firefight was led by young Turks Jitu Patwari and Jaivardhan Singh, Digvijaya’s son, who landed up at the hotel to “rescue their besieged colleagues.” With Digvijaya marshalling troops on the ground and Nath on the phone line from Bhopal , Congress launched a fierce counterattack.Around 2 am, BSP MLA Rambai was the first to be brought out. In the next few hours, five more MLAs had stepped out. And around 10am, there were signs of relief on Congress faces back in Bhopal. Former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan flew back to Bhopal on a chartered plane at 10.30am. And BJP soon issued statements, saying they had nothing to do with the controversy and it was Congress’s internal matter.At 4 pm, the six MLAs — Congress’s Adal Singh Kansana, Ranvir Jatav and Kamlesh Jatav , BSP’s Ram Bai and Sanjeev Kushwah and SP’s Rajesh Shukla — alighted from a chartered plane in Bhopal and were driven to the CM’s residence under tight security.Nath issued a statement, accusing BJP of trying to “destabilise the government in collaboration with mafia groups”. “BJP has been defeated every time it tried to destabilise this government,” the chief minister said. Digvijaya said, “The Congress government in Madhya Pradesh is secure and will complete its tenure of five years under chief minister Kamal Nath. We came to know of BJP’s activities and allurement after which we exposed them two days ago.”Earlier in the day, CM Nath was scheduled to fly to New Delhi, but with the homecoming, he cancelled the trip. He sent finance minister Tarun Bhanot to bring back the MLAs.Four MLAs, including an independent, remained untraced till late evening hours, though state Congress claimed they were all in touch with CM Nath and would be back soon. They include Congress’s Hardeep Singh Dang, Bisahulal Singh and Raghuraj Kansana, and independent MLA Surendra Singh Sher. Around 8:30am, Congress had claimed that these MLAs, including former minister Bisahulal Singh, were “bodily lifted and taken away by BJP”.Standing in front of the hotel in the wee hours of Wednesday, Digvijaya had alleged that former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, BJP chief whip Narottam Mishra and former BJP ministers Rampal Singh and Sanjay Pathak were “sitting inside the hotel with money”.But Mishra denied any involvement in the drama or having flown to Bengaluru with the four MLAs. “There is disgruntlement in Congress and BJP is nowhere in the picture,” he said over telephone, adding that he is in Delhi. “Congress MLAs are unhappy. If any MLA comes to meet us, it does not mean we are luring them with money.” Asked where the missing Congress MLAs are, he said, “They are angry with their party’s government.”Mishra claimed 15 to 20 Congress MLAs in touch with him. “What is so inappropriate if some Congress MLAs come to meet me? Let Congress prove that I offered money to their MLAs. Who is stopping Digvijaya Singh from giving proof?” he said.Chouhan said, “The issue is within the Congress family and they are levelling accusations at us.” Asked why he went to Delhi, Chouhan said, “I am the national vice-president of BJP. When the party calls me to Delhi, I go there. Now I am going to Agar. We have to win elections.” Dismissing Digvijaya’s allegations, Chouhan said, “There are so many factions in Congress and the strife is within their party while they make allegations against us. The BJP is never involved in activities like this. But if anything occurs under the government’s own weight then what can we do?”Newly-appointed state BJP president V D Sharma said, “This is Congress’ infighting. The BJP is not interested in such activities.”Back in fold: Congress’s Adal Singh Kansana, Ranvir Jatav and Kamlesh Jatav, BSP’s Ram Bai and Sanjeev Kushwah and SP’s Rajesh ShuklaMissing: Congress’s Hardeep Singh Dang, Bisahulal Singh and Raghuraj Kansana, and independent MLA Surendra Singh Sher.",politics,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74484069,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-695031,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//politics/news/madhya-pradesh-government-staves-off-crisis-as-6-mlas-return-to-congress/articleshow/74484070.cms

The Congress firefight was led by young Turks Jitu Patwari and Jaivardhan Singh, Digvijaya’s son, who landed up at the hotel to “rescue their besieged colleagues.” With Digvijaya marshalling troops on the ground and Nath on the phone line from Bhopal , Congress launched a fierce counterattack.

Around 2 am, BSP MLA Rambai was the first to be brought out. In the next few hours, five more MLAs had stepped out. And around 10am, there were signs of relief on Congress faces back in Bhopal. Former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan flew back to Bhopal on a chartered plane at 10.30am. And BJP soon issued statements, saying they had nothing to do with the controversy and it was Congress’s internal matter.

At 4 pm, the six MLAs — Congress’s Adal Singh Kansana, Ranvir Jatav and Kamlesh Jatav , BSP’s Ram Bai and Sanjeev Kushwah and SP’s Rajesh Shukla — alighted from a chartered plane in Bhopal and were driven to the CM’s residence under tight security.

Nath issued a statement, accusing BJP of trying to “destabilise the government in collaboration with mafia groups”. “BJP has been defeated every time it tried to destabilise this government,” the chief minister said. Digvijaya said, “The Congress government in Madhya Pradesh is secure and will complete its tenure of five years under chief minister Kamal Nath. We came to know of BJP’s activities and allurement after which we exposed them two days ago.”

Earlier in the day, CM Nath was scheduled to fly to New Delhi, but with the homecoming, he cancelled the trip. He sent finance minister Tarun Bhanot to bring back the MLAs.

Four MLAs, including an independent, remained untraced till late evening hours, though state Congress claimed they were all in touch with CM Nath and would be back soon. They include Congress’s Hardeep Singh Dang, Bisahulal Singh and Raghuraj Kansana, and independent MLA Surendra Singh Sher. Around 8:30am, Congress had claimed that these MLAs, including former minister Bisahulal Singh, were “bodily lifted and taken away by BJP”.

Standing in front of the hotel in the wee hours of Wednesday, Digvijaya had alleged that former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, BJP chief whip Narottam Mishra and former BJP ministers Rampal Singh and Sanjay Pathak were “sitting inside the hotel with money”.

But Mishra denied any involvement in the drama or having flown to Bengaluru with the four MLAs. “There is disgruntlement in Congress and BJP is nowhere in the picture,” he said over telephone, adding that he is in Delhi. “Congress MLAs are unhappy. If any MLA comes to meet us, it does not mean we are luring them with money.” Asked where the missing Congress MLAs are, he said, “They are angry with their party’s government.”

Mishra claimed 15 to 20 Congress MLAs in touch with him. “What is so inappropriate if some Congress MLAs come to meet me? Let Congress prove that I offered money to their MLAs. Who is stopping Digvijaya Singh from giving proof?” he said.

Chouhan said, “The issue is within the Congress family and they are levelling accusations at us.” Asked why he went to Delhi, Chouhan said, “I am the national vice-president of BJP. When the party calls me to Delhi, I go there. Now I am going to Agar. We have to win elections.” Dismissing Digvijaya’s allegations, Chouhan said, “There are so many factions in Congress and the strife is within their party while they make allegations against us. The BJP is never involved in activities like this. But if anything occurs under the government’s own weight then what can we do?”

Newly-appointed state BJP president V D Sharma said, “This is Congress’ infighting. The BJP is not interested in such activities.”

Back in fold: Congress’s Adal Singh Kansana, Ranvir Jatav and Kamlesh Jatav, BSP’s Ram Bai and Sanjeev Kushwah and SP’s Rajesh Shukla

Missing: Congress’s Hardeep Singh Dang, Bisahulal Singh and Raghuraj Kansana, and independent MLA Surendra Singh Sher.

32,['5/03/2020'],"Telecom AGR Dues: Pay Rs 77,000 crore dues without any delay, government tells telecom companies","Submit docus for AGR dues’ calculations: DoT to telcos

NEW DELHI: The telecom department on Wednesday sent recovery notices of Rs 76,746 crore to Vodafone Idea, Airtel and Tata Tele, expressing unhappiness at their decision to make part payments against AGR (adjusted gross revenue) dues and asking them to deposit the balance amount “without any further delay” to comply with the Supreme Court’s orders.“Partial payment cannot be construed as compliance to the SC order dated October 24, 2019 and February 14 this year … pay balance amount without any further delay,” the telecom ministry said in a letter to the three companies, making it clear that it wants to collect the full dues that have been ordered by the top court, highly-placed sources told TOI.Vodafone Idea has so far paid only Rs 3,500 crore towards the Rs 53,038 crore demanded from the company, while Airtel has paid Rs 18,004 crore against the Rs 35,586 crore demanded from it. Tata group companies, Tata Teleservices Limited (TTSL) and Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Limited (TTML), cumulatively paid Rs 4,197 crore towards the Rs 13,823 crore asked from them.Commenting on the development, another senior official said, “With this notice, the companies now need to pay the balance amount immediately or else face penal action that, in the first step, would include encashment of bank guarantees submitted by them. Thereafter, if they do not replenish the guarantees and submit the balance AGR dues, we will look at the extreme step of cancelling their telecom license for which a show cause notice will be issued,” one of the source said.As per Wednesday’s notice, Vodafone Idea will thus need to submit Rs 49,538 crore to the telecom department immediately, while Airtel will need to pay Rs 17,582 crore. Tata companies will need to deposit Rs 9,626 crore.Questions sent to the companies on Wednesday evening remained unanswered. When contacted over phone, a spokesperson for Airtel declined to comment.The DoT notice said that the top court’s order mandates the companies to pay the entire license fee and spectrum usage charge (SUC) dues, along with interest, penalty, and interest on penalty, on an “upfront” basis.Also, the telecom department asked the telcos to submit supporting documents in lieu of the AGR calculations that they have done in their self-assessment. “The said details/documents are urgently required for proper reconciliation of the legitimate dues because amount paid by you is based on self-assessment.”The tough stance taken by the government on the matter comes at a time when the telecom companies insist that their AGR dues are way lower than what is being demanded out of them. Also, Vodafone Idea has made it clear that it does not have the financial strength to pay the balance amount without a government bailout, which should be extended in various forms including a staggered payment option, and reduction in license fee and spectrum charges that telecom companies need to pay.“At this point in time, we do not have the financial strength to pay the balance, self-assessed principal, interest, penalty and interest on penalty. In the present financial situation, we would be in a position to do so only if the DoT and the government can kindly take up the steps we are requesting,” a top Vodafone Idea officer said in a February 25 letter sent to the Telecom Secretary and the Prime Minister’s Office, which was also marked to the Finance Minister , Cabinet Secretary, among other high-ranking officials.The government and the multi-ministry Digital Communications Commission (DCC) are already seized of the industry’s woes and are understood to be working on a series of options, including a staggered payment or part cash payout and the rest through bonds & warrants.Vodafone’s Global CEO Nick Read will be visiting the country later this week, and has sought time for a meeting with Telecom and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad for Friday. Kumar Mangalam Birla , the company’s Indian partner and the chairman of Vodafone Idea, has had meetings with Prasad and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on the matter.The source said that a fresh DCC meeting is expected on the matter very soon where the final contours of a possible relief package may come up.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74486831,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-2248219,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pay-rs-77000-crore-dues-without-any-delay-government-tells-telecom-companies/articleshow/74484112.cms

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed the bill to implement the ‘Vivad se Vishwas’ scheme with estimates suggesting that the government could mop up Rs 1.5 lakh crore from the latest project to settle pending direct tax disputes.

The government had tasted success with a similar scheme for indirect taxes last year, prompting it to go for the ‘Vivad se Vishwas’ scheme in the Budget. Apart from reducing litigation, the scheme could help the government mop up massive revenue at a time when tax collections have been muted.

The bill was cleared by the lower House through a voice vote. More than 4.8 lakh direct tax cases involving Rs 9.3 lakh core in disputed amount are locked in various appellate forums such as Commissioner (Appeals), ITAT, debt recovery tribunals, high courts and the Supreme Court with the amount topping 80% of the government’s direct tax revenue in 2018-19. Not just in case of tax disputes, the scheme can also be availed of in search and seizure operations where the recovery is up to Rs 5 crore.

While the government is going all out to get taxpayers to come forward and settle the dispute, industry representatives, too, said the scheme is an attractive offer, especially for the “early birds”.

Under the scheme, a taxpayer who pays the disputed tax before March 31, will get complete waiver of interest and penalty. The scheme would remain open from March 1 to June 30, 2020, and those who avail of it after March 31 would have to pay some additional amount.

35,['5/03/2020'],Life insurers to insist on medical tests to keep term rates under check,"Companies said, given the coronavirus scare, insurance becomes more crucial (Reuters)

MUMBAI: Buying a term cover could get more difficult, even as insurers are already indicating that term rates for life policies could rise 15-20% from April due to higher reinsurance costs. The companies are now likely to insist on health checks as medically underwritten policies attract relatively lower reinsurance costs.

Term insurance policies — contracts which compensate only in the event of death without any survival benefits — have crashed more than 50% since liberalisation. Companies have offered term insurance of up to Rs 1 crore for rates as low as Rs 6,000.

Coronavirus outbreak: Complete coverage

Even as they reduced the premiums, insurers also accepted proposals without insisting on medical checks instead of opting for financial underwriting. The assumption was that those who are wealthier are better placed to take care of themselves or avail medical treatment, thus reducing mortality risks. This is in addition to factoring in life expectancy, where India lags behind developed countries.

‘Term insurance premium equal to those in US and UK’

“The pricing of term insurance in India has been aggressive because of a rate war between companies. At present, term insurance rates are equal to those in the US and the UK, and cheaper than Singapore ,” said Santosh Agarwal , chief business officer ( life insurance ), PolicyBazaar.

Coronavirus outbreak: Live updates

Earlier this month, LIC chairman M R Kumar had also indicated that term insurance rates would rise because of reinsurance. According to Agarwal, reinsurers charge more for life policies that are issued without medical checks as against those that have been issued after the applicant has undergone tests. “To keep the rate increase at 15-20%, companies will increase medical underwriting,” said Agarwal.

Life insurance companies reinsure their portfolios to protect themselves against unexpectedly large claims. Reinsurance is also a statutory requirement. Companies said, given the coronavirus scare, insurance becomes more crucial. “Now we are in the process of smoothening the medical underwriting journey, letting the customer schedule medical checks online, and link our systems, the insurance company and the third-party administrator doing the check,” said Agarwal.

37,['5/03/2020'],Gadchiroli cops immortalize Jambhulkheda martyrs in table calendar,"Nagpur: As a mark of respect and remembrance, Gadchiroli police have come out with a unique table calendar featuring pictures of 15 martyrs of Jambhulkheda blast of May 1 last year. The pictures of the jawans have been printed on the page displaying respective month of their birth.

Fifteen jawans of Quick Response Team (QRT) and a civilian driver, on way to Dadapur village, were killed in a blast triggered by Maoists at Lendhari nullah near Jambhulkheda in Kurkheda taluka of north Gadchiroli. The jawans were heading to assist Purada police station staffers in investigating an arson at Dadapur village where the Maoists had torched 36 vehicles of a road construction company and later deployed ‘call ambush’.

Apart from putting up the pictures in the martyrs’ gallery, Gadchiroli police, under SP Shailesh Balkawade, conceptualized the table calendar.

Sub-inspector Prashant Diwate, public relation officer and also in-charge of propaganda cell, said the calendar also has snippets and brief description of the civic actions or community programmes which the police had organized for establishing rapport with the masses.

“We have covered in pictures and captions the positive developments and achievements of the district police ranging from conducting two elections (assembly and general) without allowing Maoists to disrupt the proceedings to several ‘jan jagaran melawas’ or public awareness rallies at remote places,” he said.

The calendar also displays logo of Gadchiroli police’s elite C-60 commando force with it’s tagline ‘Veer bhogya vasundhara’ (The brave shall enjoy the world) on one side and the state police on the other corner.

The C-60 commandos, with their accomplishments like eliminating 40 cadres in Kasnasur-Boriya encounters in April 2018, had catapulted the image of Gadchiroli police nationwide especially overshadowing the Telangana’s Grey Hounds which earlier hogged the limelight for their daredevil actions against Maoists and taming the Reds in the hinterlands.

38,['5/03/2020'],Kamptee co to pay daily fine for delay in project,"Nagpur: With municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe acting tough on employees and contractors, the engineers too have started following suit by taking action against erring contractors.

The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) traffic department has started levying fine of Rs20,000 per day on Kamptee-based Abhi Engineering for delay in completion of sewage and stormwater drain project approved by Devendra Fadnavis during his tenure as chief minister in his South-West constituency. The action was supposed to begin from June 2018.

An engineer from NMC’s traffic department told TOI that a proposal seeking further action will be put up before chief engineer Ulhas Debadwar soon. “Abhi Engineering was supposed to complete works within 11 months from August 31, 2017. Extension was given to it till November 20, 2019. A notice was served to the contractor on January 16 directing to complete works within three months or face daily fine,” he said.

“Now, we have decided to recover fine of Rs20,000 per day with effect from November 20, 2019. The proposal seeking further directives on whether to terminate contract, give extension, double the fine or any other action will be submitted to the chief engineer,” he added.

Considering sewage and stormwater problems in the constituency, Fadnavis had approved Rs35 crore for the project in 2016. The NMC divided the work in two parts. The work order of stormwater drain costing Rs21.17 crore and sewage drain worth Rs 12.06 crore were awarded to Abhi Engineering. The project was to be completed within 11 months. The NMC was supposed to levy penalty on a daily basis from June 2018.

Activist Suraj Lolage , who had lodged a series of complaints in this case, told TOI, “Engineers have started levying penalty only to save themselves from earning Mundhe’s wrath. Less than 30% work was completed as the extended deadline of November 20, 2019 lapsed. It’s clear that the work was at an initial stage in the first deadline, but no action was taken. Work is below 50% complete as on date. Citizens are left to face problems despite availability of funds and issuance of work orders.”

Lolage said that engineers are yet to initiate action on his complaint that Abhi Engineering is using a stretch of London Street Project for storing pipelines and accommodation of labourers for the last one-and-a-half years.

“The NMC, under RTI, informed me that no such permission was given to use the land. I had raised several complaints when the work order was about to be issued to Abhi Engineering, but nothing happened. The work order cost was exclusive of GST. But, yhe engineers calculated bills of Abhi Engineering, including GST. They excluded GST only after my complaints. The traffic department, which has nothing to do with civil works, is executing the project which itself is a massive irregularity,” he said.

Ajju Vijayvargiya, owner of Abhi Engineering, has blamed the NMC for delay. “No plan was given to us with work order for laying the network. The engineers did not give us site clearance. The scope of work was revised many times. Instead of the main line, they are now demanding us to lay network as per requests of zone officials and corporators. We are yet to get a single bill as on date. The penalty levied on us is unjustified,” he said.

39,['5/03/2020'],Niti Aayog seeks to change lowest bidder norm for government contracts,"Union minister Nitin Gadkari

NEW DELHI: Niti Aayog will prepare a draft proposal to suggest alternatives to the current ‘lowest bidder’ (L1) tendering norm to overcome deficiencies in the process which doesn’t give sufficient weightage to quality parameters. In the current system, which is called Least Cost Selection Method, the bidder quoting the lowest price wins the contract.

Speaking at an event “Goodbye L1”organised by Consulting Engineers Association of India , Niti Aayog vice chairman Rajeev Kumar said everyone knows about the deficiencies in the L1 norm and by following this tendering model, government agencies have “tied their hands and feet”. He referred to a concept paper by Central Vigilance Commission which has talked about the need to revisit current norm and how an all-inclusive public procurement strategy is required, in sync with a rapidly changing world. It has suggested that conventional L1 method is not suited for major infrastructure projects.

Stressing that greater public support was required for the change considering the “moral hazard” attached to such a proposal, Union minister Nitin Gadkari said, “The spirit behind the theme ‘Goodbye L1’ is good, the strategy may not be right. If L1 doesn’t get a contract, people feel that the minister or bureaucrats must have made good money. So, there are risks of getting blamed even if intention is good.”

Kumar said the L1 bidding norm not only impacts infrastructure projects but other government works as well. He said the current tendering system affects research laboratories and defence bodies as they find it difficult to get the right quality product because the tenders go to the lowest bidder. Pointing out that the change can happen only if there is a public demand, he said, “Make a bigger coalition and create public opinion. You should spread the discussion how following alternative norms is beneficial and there will be no increase in cost...because of L1 bidding practice we have not been able to create globally competitive infrastructure firms barring only a few.”

PILIBHIT: A mastermind of a gang of cheats who duped people by promising them jobs abroad was produced in the court of chief judicial magistrate in Pilibhit on Tuesday.

The accused was identified as Abdul Kareem Rahman, a resident of Mumbai. He was lodged in a Bangalore jail since November 16, 2018 in connection with another case of duping people.

In Pilibhit, police said, Rahman played a key role in duping three people of Rs 24 lakh each on the pretext of sending them to Canada on jobs.

In August 2018, the Sungarhi police station in Pilibhit had registered two FIRs in this matter under IPC section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 364 (kidnapping with intension of murder), 392 (robbery), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 342 (wrongful confinement).

In September, Pilibhit police arrested three of Rahman’s aides -- Harpal Singh and Gurupal Singh of Takiya village under Gajraula police station and Karanjeet of Deepnagar village under Tikunia police station in Lakhimpur Kheri district.

The trio told Pilibhit police that they had taken the two victims to Bangalore, saying they would have to board their flight for Canada from there. On reaching Bangalore, the two youths were taken hostage. They were forced to call home to their families that they had reached Canada from a mobile phone with a Canadian SIM. Once their families got a “confirmation that they had reached Canada”, they made full payment to the cheats. Thereafter, the trio fled from Bangalore, abandoning the victims in an isolated area.

During investigations, Pilibhit police learnt of Rahman. Once they came to know that he was in a Bangalore jail, they obtained a warrant B from a Pilibhit court on November 20 and filed it with the Bangalore jail office. The Karnataka police brought Rahman to Pilibhit on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar and six others, including two UP policemen, were convicted on Wednesday of “culpable homicide not amounting to murder” in the death of the Unnao rape survivor’s father.

According to special judge Dharmesh Sharma, the accused demonstrated their “political and muscle power” to criminally intimidate the deceased and his family and deter them from pursuing the sexual assault case against Sengar. While framing charges in August last year, the court had viewed the death as “part of a larger conspiracy to deter, silence and prevent the father from pursuing the complaint” regarding the rape of his daughter in 2017. The court will hear arguments on the quantum of punishment on March 12.

Besides Sengar, the court convicted then Makhi police station in-charge Ashok Singh Bhadauria, sub-inspector K P Singh, and Vineet Mishra , Birendra Singh , Shashi Pratap Singh and Atul Singh , Sengar’s brother. It came on record that the man was brutally assaulted but charges of assault, criminal intimidation and possession of firearms were made against him.

The central government in February approved the bill with a few key changes. Compared to the earlier law, the bill is under scrutiny for points ranging from rights of same-sex couples to unwed women. The theme of the discussion was ‘Surrogacy: The Ethical Dilemma.’ The panel consisted of Dr Nayana Patel, surrogacy expert, Tanishtha Samanta from IIT-Gandhinagar, K Parameswaran from Gujarat National Law University (GNLU), and Kelly Dhru, a doctoral scholar at Hamburg University. They discussed medical, legal, sociological, and bioethical aspects.

Patel said that surrogacy is allowed for divorced and widowed women but not for unwed women.

The panel said that may discourage doctors. GNLU launched India Bioethics Project that will carry out research in fields such as contraception, abortion, pre-natal diagnosis for sex selection. “Through this project, GNLU intends to contribute soft laws to such vital areas,” said Dr S Shanthakumar, director of GNLU.

NEW DELHI: The UN Human Rights Council is yet to file an intervention petition in the Supreme Court as amicus curiae in a case challenging the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

Responding to a question by TOI, the spokesperson for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said, “The amicus brief is still being processed, and is being handled here in Geneva.” This means the rights body has not engaged an Indian attorney to represent it in India.

While it might be a first in India, the OHCHR has filed similar amicus curiae petitions in many countries in the world. Sources in the UN said such petitions were normally filed in countries which were believed to have an independent judiciary.

In the past few years, the OHCHR has filed similar petitions in the US Supreme Court (2012) to support petitioners Donald Vance and Nathan Ertel versus Donald Rumsfeld , former defence secretary, on the issue of torture, as well as in two other cases — one in the Supreme Court and one in the US Court of Appeals in the fourth circuit. Almost all of them concerned the use of torture.

The UN filed similar petitions in Brazil ’s Supreme Court regarding the denial of abortion services, made in response to the Brazilian government’s response to the outbreak of Zika virus, and a second on the constitutionality of a differentiated disciplinary regime in that country.

It has filed in the constitutional tribunal of Peru, as well as in the constitutional court of South Korea, and even the federal high court of Nigeria last month. The OHCHR has intervened similarly in a case in the Supreme Court of UK on abortion in Northern Ireland. The European Court for Human Rights received two such petitions in 2011 and 2015.

The case in lower court was a result of a private complaint filed by a member of the Sikh community against the 11 petitioners. An inter-family dispute had found its way before the community elders for settlement around seven years ago. The petitioners contend that the respondent did not follow through with the promises made at the Gurudwara to resolve the dispute and disagreements from both sides. This ultimately led to the respondent approaching the trial court, orders being issued by the judge to proceed with the case and petitioners moving HC to quash the proceedings.

Advocate Amit Khare, who appeared for all 11 petitioners, told the bench headed by Justice Rohit Deo that the “process issued by the trial court against all the petitioners is unwarranted and abuse of the process of law by the respondents to harass the petitioners”. He prayed for a stay on the entire proceedings before the trial court at Nagpur during the pendency of the instant petition, which was granted. Advocate AN Ansari, who appeared for the respondent, has sought time to file a reply.

KOLKATA: Buniyadpur (Dakshin Dinajpur): Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday clarified her stand on refugees following her views as reported in sections of the media and categorically denied having said that Bangladeshi immigrants were bona fide citizens of India.

“I have never said that people of Bangladesh are our citizens. There are citizens of Bangladesh as we are citizens of India. India, Pakistan and Bangladesh were one country before Partition in 1947. Many people from Pakistan and now Bangladesh came over to India after Partition. I referred to them,” Banerjee said at a public rally in Buniyadpur, Dakshin Dinajpur.

Benerjee had raised the issue while taking on BJP on the CAA-NPR-NRC issue. “Some people may come to your home and ask about your parents and their address. Don’t answer them,” the CM said, pointing to a reply on an RTI application asking for PM Modi’s citizenship certificate. “Look at the response. It says the PM is a citizen of India by birth and so the question of his having a citizenship certificate (which is citizenship by registration) does not arise. Why should others born in this country have to show documents?” she said.

50,['5/03/2020'],"Girls get first-hand experience to act as collector, SP ‘for a day’","Nagpur: In a unique initiative to boost the confidence of girls and motivate them ahead of International Women’s Day (March 8), the Buldhana district administration gave an opportunity to bright girls of government schools to act as collector and superintendent of police for a day.

Conceptualized by Buldhana collector Suman Chandra, the weeklong initiative will allow girls to experience administration’s functioning and address other issues. The initiative aims to provide them with exposure towards governance and administration besides making them feel confident and more inspired towards their goal as well as motivate other girls.

According to Chandra, “Bright and meritorious girls of the zilla parishad schools will get an opportunity to sit on the collector’s chair to have a first-hand experience of governance. This will also give them an opportunity to decide the changes they would like to bring in the society, if given such an opportunity.”

On the first day of this unique drive, Poonam Deshmukh, a Class 8 student from Padoli zilla parishad school, acted as collector and oversaw the administrative work. She took stock of the unseasonal rainfall in the district and got details about the crop damage in Khamgaon tehsil from superintending district agriculture officer Narendra Naik. Later she interacted with the media and participated in the ‘Lokshahi Din’.

“Poonam expressed happiness about her experience and went home as a more confident girl,” Chandra told PTI.

Another girl, Maria, a Class 9 student from a zilla parishad school in Malkapur tehsil, attended a census meeting and understand how the census is conducted.

“They get an exposure for a day and we also make them write a diary wherein they note down their experience and their vision for society. They will share their experience at a programme on Women’s Day,” said Chandra.

Poonam told TOI, “Acting as a collector for a day is one of the most important days of my life. Now I aspire to become collector one day and will put in my best efforts to realize my dream.” She said her elder sister wanted to become the collector but could not do so due to family constraints. “Girls should study well and prove their potential,” Poonam said.

Under the same initiative, another girl, Sahrish Kanwal, from zilla parishad Urdu high school, Malkapur tehsil, took over as the district superintendent of police for a day from SP Dilip Patil. She resolved to end cases of atrocities against women and child and aim towards ensuring every girl becomes self-dependent and proves her mettle.

The district administration is also celebrating ‘Pink Week’, focusing on women’s health. “A woman in the pink of her health will keep the society in the pink of health,” Chandra said. All the primary health centres in the district are conducting the drive to ensure good health for women.

The district administration has organized screening for anaemia, breast cancer, cervical cancer and non-communicable diseases. “All these efforts are being made to focus on the welfare of women and eventually, their empowerment in the long-run,” Chandra said.

51,['5/03/2020'],SBM impact on rural women: 93% feel safer after having household toilets,"NEW DELHI: Nearly 93% of rural women feel safer from assault by not going out in the open to defecate, a survey on the impact of Swachh Bharat Mission has found.

The survey was carried out by the UNICEF and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) on Wednesday in the run up to International Women’s Day on March 8.

A total of 6,993 women across the five states of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh , Maharashtra , Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh were covered and it was conducted last month.

The survey released by Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on Wednesday found that 91% women save up to one hour of their day, which they earlier spent on walking to defecation sites. Nearly 88% of women respondents said they are proud to own a toilet.

Similarly, 93% women respondents felt that they need not have to stop eating to control the urge to defecate anymore while 81% said they need not worry about privacy while changing menstrual hygiene material. Another big finding was 93% said they no longer fear contracting infections as they use household toilets.

""The increased access to household toilets has led to the improvement in the suvidha (convenience), suraksha (safety) and swabhimaan (self-respect) of women in rural India,"" an official statement said.

Shekhawat on Wednesday also launched the phase-II of Swachh Bharat Mission ( Grameen ) on Wednesday.

The second phase of SBM (gramin) will be implemented from 2020-21 to 2024-25 in a mission mode with a total outlay of nearly Rs 1.41 lakh crore.

""This will be a novel model of convergence between different verticals of financing. Of this Rs 52,497 crore will be allocated from the budget of Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, while the remaining amount will be dovetailed from the funds being released under 15th Finance Commission , MGNREGS and revenue generation models particularly for solid and liquid waste management,"" the jal shakti ministry said in a release.

52,['5/03/2020'],AAR halts smooth take-off for a Mauritius JV partner and holds cap gains as taxable in India,"MUMBAI: The Authority for Advance Rulings has denied the benefit of capital gains tax exemption to a Mauritius resident entity, which sold its shares in an Indian company.

This sale pertained to the period prior to April 1, 2017, when as per treaty provisions, India did not have the right to tax such capital gains. For sales, post this date, India under a renegotiated tax treaty with Mauritius has obtained the right to tax capital gains on sale of shares of an Indian company. In addition, India’s general anti-avoidance rules (GAAR) came into effect from the financial year 2017-18, with investments prior to that (such as those made by the Mauritius entity, in this case) being grandfathered.

However, the AAR looked into the entire nature of the transactions in a holistic manner and concluded that it was a conduit to avoid tax.

The applicant, Bid Services Division (Mauritius) was a second tier (step-down) subsidiary of a listed South African company. It with its JV partners, GVK Airports Holding (GVK) and ASCA Global had successfully bid for operation and maintenance of the Mumbai airport.

It held a 27% stake in the consortium company, Mumbai International Airport Private Limited. Under a share purchase agreement entered into in March 2011, it divested 13.5% of its holding to GVK for US $ 231 million.

It approached the AAR to determine the taxability of capital gains. It contended that it held a Mauritius tax residency certificate and that in the absence of a limitation of benefit clause in the India-Mauritius tax treaty, the beneficial provisions of the tax treaty (aka capital gains tax exemption) cannot be denied.

However, the AAR noted that it was a shell company, interposed merely to obtain a tax advantage. Thus, by placing emphasis on ‘substance over form’, the AAR denied the tax treaty benefits.

Dhruva Advisors, in their tax alert point out that availability of tax benefits to a Mauritius entity under the tax treaty has been the subject of intense litigation over the years, with the tax department closely evaluating the commercial expediency, beneficial ownership and substance requirements in the transaction.

“The AAR in this case have disregarded circular no 789 issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) which treated the tax residency certificate as conclusive evidence of beneficial ownership. The Supreme Court had also affirmed this in the case of Azadi Bachao. Instead the AAR applied anti-abuse rules emanating from various judicial precedents,” points out the tax alert.

Unlike court orders, rulings of the AAR merely have persuasive value in similar cases. However, the ruling throws light on how the commercial nature of each and every transaction can be closely scrutinized by the tax authorities, which puts more onus on the taxpayers to back up transactions with a proper commercial reasoning, sums up Dhruva Advisors .

“For many of us, cancer means death. But, I’m a living example in front of you all. We can defeat cancer at any stage,” she said while sharing her experience of battling cancer.

The actor was diagnosed with high-grade cancer two years back, in 2018. Doctors had told her that she had 30% chances of survival. She decided to take the battle head-on and finally emerged victorious.

Sonali visited Nagpur’s National Cancer Institute (NCI) on March 5 to celebrate the first anniversary of ‘Ayushmati’, a unique initiative of NCI that supports free cancer screening for healthy women above 40 years of age.

In the last one year, 1398 women from Nagpur got themselves screened for three types of cancers in NCI for free.

“We all believe that cancer is not going happen to me. But we need to understand this can happen to anybody. Women feel shy or experience fear even from getting screened for cancer. If you don’t get screened, how will you detect it in the early stage?,” she asked while appreciating the Ayushmati project.

Sonali embraced and advocated the tagline of the National Cancer Institute which is “Freedom from Fear of Cancer”. “I think it is important to spread the message — Early Detection Saves Lives,” she said.

The programme began with the introduction to the National Cancer Institute and its initiatives, especially “Ayushmati”, by Shailesh Joglekar, General Secretary and CEO.

Dr Anand Pathak, medical director, gave an outline about the journey of ‘Ayushmati’ and the data trends observed. He impressed upon the need for cancer screening for women for early detection due to the growing prevalence of cancer among women in India.

Shital Teli-Ugale, Metropolitan Commissioner, NMRDA was the guest of honour.

“A complete household revolves around women and the well-being of women determines the well-being of the family. If we save lives of women through early detection, we are saving the complete household and all the members involved,” she said.

She encouraged women to come forward for early detection and appreciated the efforts taken by National Cancer Institute by conducting “Ayushmati”.

Sonali Bendre, chief guest of the function, expressed how fascinated and shell-shocked she was after visiting the National Cancer Institute as she compared it with other globally located cancer hospitals.

She shared her experience of battling cancer and her denial saying, “How can this happen to me? We all have the believe that this is not going happen to me. But we need to understand this can happen to anybody.”

“Ayushmati” will continue operating for the next year and would invite women who have visited through the past one year for cancer screenings and continue to encourage other women above the age of 40 to get themselves screened.

About 1,400 Puducherry-made IMFL bottles, three cars and three motorbikes all worth about Rs 25 lakh were seized from the accused. Police also detained some land owners suspecting their involvement in the racket.

A senior police officer identified the arrested as prime accused M Balakrishnan, 38, of Kodungiyur village, P Pandiyan, 36, R Ranjith, 22, A Shagul Hameed, 19, A Anandh Raj, 23, V Balu, 53, G Ajith Kumar, 24, P Madhan, 25, M Ajith Kumar, 24, and P Velangkannan, 28, from Karaikal, Cuddalore, Chennai and Valathi. He refused to reveal the identity of the two detained land owners.

Police said that based on the direction by Villupuram SP S Jayakumar to monitor smuggling of liquor into the district, a team headed by Villupuram and Kotakuppam PEW inspectors Renukha Devi and Vishnu Priya was conducting vehicle check at Valathi bus stop near Gingee from Tuesday night.

Around 6 am on Wednesday, police intercepted three cars and two motorbikes trying to cross the spot one after the other. Following a check, they identified that the occupants of the vehicles belonged to the same gang and were smuggling about 27 cartons of 180 ml bottles and eight cartons of 750 ml bottles in the vehicles.

Interrogation with the accused revealed that Balakrishnan was running a tire retreading unit at Muruganthangal junction road for more than a year and had used the rented shop for stocking the IMFL bottles and operating a fake liquor unit in the shop.

Police, who booked a case against the gang, are holding further investigation to ascertain whether they supplied the adulterated liquor to TASMAC outlets.

Based on a report by the Vellore district child protection officer, the school management placed the teacher under suspension from Wednesday.

P Nishanthini, district child protection officer of Vellore, said that based on a tip received on WhatsApp, on Monday child protection officials paid a visit to the school which has around 250 boys and girls studying in Class VI to X.

“When we checked the attendance register of Class VI, the victim was marked absent from February 3. Inquiries revealed that the girl was unable to recover from the trauma and decided to drop out of school. We, along with the child welfare committee, are initiating steps to find the girl now with her distant relative and make her continue studies in a school she prefers,” Nishanthini said.

Quoting a girl student, Nishanthini said the victim stayed at her grandmother’s house near the school. Suresh Kumar, 45, her class teacher, had been molesting the girl for more than six months after taking her to remote spots during class hours and had threatened her of dire consequences if she reveals it to her relatives, Nishanthini said. “A month ago some Class X students caught Suresh Kumar sexually assaulting the girl and informed the victim’s grandmother. From February 3, the girl stopped attending school,” she added.

When TOI contacted a relative of the girl, he said that over the past two years, more than three sexual assault complaints were lodged against Suresh Kumar by parents of three girl students. However, the headmaster of the school issued only a warning instead of escalating the matter to the management and education department, he said. “We demand appropriate action both against Suresh Kumar and the headmaster,” he added.

Meanwhile, based on a report by the district child protection unit, the management launched a departmental inquiry against Suresh Kumar.

57,['5/03/2020'],Four PU students on hunger strike against fee hike faint,"Puducherry: Four of the five students of Pondicherry University , who were on a hunger strike from February 29 demanding that the administration revoke increase in fees, fainted and were admitted in a private medical college and hospital on Wednesday.

Theerdha Thulasi, 19, a second year MSc (physics) integrated student, fainted on the fifth day of the strike in the morning. She was rushed to Pondicherry Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) where she was administered intravenous fluids. Soon, three other fasting students lost consciousness and were also rushed to Pims. All the four were discharged after treatment in the evening. Another group of five students commenced the relay indefinite hunger strike from Wednesday at the administrative block.

Meanwhile, the university administration has directed the protesting students to clear the administrative block and shift to Ponlait students’ corner on the campus. Registrar in-charge B Chithra in a notice said the university has earmarked an area (Ponlait students’ corner) on the campus for holding protests and agitations as followed by other central universities.

She warned that the university will take appropriate action as per the code of conduct and discipline mentioned in the prospectus against the students violating the orders. The university maintained that the fees were not hiked for several years and the fees for some courses were not increased since the inception of the university. The revision after nearly a decade (for some courses after more than three decades) would naturally show an exponential increase and not a linear increase. Except for some professional courses like MBA and computer science, the fees for the rest of the courses have been increased by 39% or less.

The students, however, refused to follow the university’s order and vowed that they will not move an inch until their demands are met. “We have heard your diktats. We have heard your silence. We have seen your violence and arrogance. We read your four pages of threat thinly disguised as appeals to our students, and we only have four words in reply to all your sincere efforts: Not an inch back: Fees must fall,” said students’ union president Parichay Yadav.

All terms will run concurrently.

The judge set off the period of sentence he had served in jail after his arrest. Judge Dhanabal, however, acquitted his friend booked on charges of abetting the crime.

According to special public prosecutor N Balamurugan, the convicted man, a lorry driver , and his friend from Reddiarpalaym approached a 16-year-old girl when she was alone at her house on April 17, 2015. The driver sought details and phone numbers of her neighbour, who had vacated the house recently. The girl told them that she did not have any information about her neighbour and attempted to lock the door.

However, the lorry driver managed to sneak into the house, overpowered and punched her on the face. He switched on the television and kept the volume high so that neighbours would not hear her screams for help and raped her. His friend stood guard when he committed the crime. The lorry driver abandoned he victim and escaped after she fainted.

The girl’s mother and sisters reached the house in a few minutes and she informed them about the incident. Her mother lodged a complaint with the D Nagar police, who booked the man under sections 6 (punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault) and Section 10 (punishment for aggravated sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and Sections 376 (punishment for rape ), 452 (house-trespass alter preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code.

59,['5/03/2020'],"Drop additional queries in NPR, says Narayanasamy","Puducherry: Chief minister V Narayanasamy on Wednesday urged Union home minister Amit Shah to drop additional queries in the 2020 survey to prepare the National Population Register ( NPR ).

In a letter to Shah, Narayanasamy urged him to remove the queries on the date and place of birth of both parents of citizens, their last place of residence, passport number, Aadhaar identity and voter identity card numbers, drivers’ license number and mother tongue while undertaking the massive survey in June and July to prepare the NPR.

Narayanasamy pointed out that illiterate poor people living without basic facilities will not be able to furnish the date and place of their birth, while senior citizens and destitute people will face hardship to furnish the date and place of birth of their parents.

“Seeking information from senior citizens and destitute people on the date and place of birth of both parents regardless of whether they are alive or not is insignificant,” he said.

Pointing out that the states of Bihar, Kerala and West Bengal have opposed NPR with additional queries, Narayanasamy said a sense of fear and panic has gripped people over seeking more information in the 2020 NPR survey compared to the one drafted by the previous UPA government in 2010.

He said though it was said that people can voluntarily come forward to furnish information on additional queries without providing any evidence, the presence of additional queries in the questionnaire has created panic.

“Hence, the Union government must drop the additional queries in the 2020 survey and stick to the queries posed during the previous 2010 survey,” Narayanasamy urged Shah in the letter.

He said people have started feeling ‘tense and insecure’ fearing that the Union government will link NPR with the National Register of Citizens (NRC) after passing the Citizenship amendment act (CAA).

People have now started fearing that the Union government, based on the information collected during the NPR, will divide them based on their religion and will strip them of citizenship.

He pointed out that the 2010 survey included queries on demographic details of individuals, including name, relationship to head of household, father’s name, mother’s name, spouse’s name (if married), sex, date of birth, marital status, place of birth, nationality (as declared), present address of residence, duration of stay at present address, permanent residential address, occupation and educational qualification.

The 2010 survey did not include any unnecessary queries, he said.

Gadchiroli: Vilas Kolha, the former commander-in-chief of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) who surrendered before Gadchiroli police last week, sees an uncertain future for the armed rebel movement. “It has suffered unprecedented setback in Maharashtra,” he told TOI.Kolha, who has 147 offences against him including 22 murders and several encounters with police, says due to police presence it is no longer easy to camp in forests for more than a few hours and organize meetings in villages. “The party seniors goad us to regroup the dalams, revive the village base by getting close to people and execute some reverses on the police but now it’s a tough ask,” he says.Youngsters are no longer “coming to us”, according to Kolha, now 44 years old. “Unlike in the past, there is no support from villagers as police are winning them over some or the other way,” he says.Kolha became the first cadre of any rank from Maharashtra to have surrendered with an AK 47 and ammunitions. He spent 10 days in the forests, many times without food and sleep, before reaching the police. After fleeing a camp at Abhujmadh with an AK 47, Kolha said he had to hide the weapon in a nullah to avoid getting caught or killed by both Maoists and police.“I still dream of being in forest camps with my men and weapons. I then wake up abruptly and start trying to grab my AK-47, only to realize that I have surrendered,” says Kolha.Kolha joined the Maoists in 2000 after his mother was labelled a witch following which the family faced social ostracization. According to him, the original Maoist idea was to strengthen the mass base in forest and then head towards urban areas. “We had managed to put some organizations and cadres in cities too but most got arrested. Don’t know what will be the future from here on,” he says.According to him, around 200 of them were carrying the movement ahead in Gadchiroli. The number got depleted when 40 got killed in one go in the Kasnasur-Boriya twin encounters in April 2018.“Camping on the riverbank (Indravati river dividing Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh) was suicidal. We did not keep any escape route and so when the attack took place (from security forces), our cadres had no option but to jump in the river and die after getting surrounded,” he says adding that Maoists analyse each and every encounter or incident, irrespective of the consequences, to evolve best practices.“There were none to marshal the force after senior leaders like Sainath and Shreenu (divisional committee members or DVCM) were hit,” he says.The former dreaded Maoist, however, chose not to speak on the questionable encounter of DVCM Nandu and five others in Boriya on April 23, 2018, on the following day of Kasnasur fire exchange where 34 cadres were killed.Kolha was part of the team that orchestrated the Jambhulkheda blast. He clarified that it was neither revenge for Bhaskar’s wife Ramko’s (neutralized in questionable manner with her aide Shilpa at Gundurvahi in 2019) nor Kasnasur-Boriya encounters.He admits that the Kasnasur-Boriya encounters further shook up the already quivering mass base of Maoists in Gadchiroli. “The Jambhulkheda blast, in which 15 jawans died, happened last year after seniors started goading us to counter police to boost the movement’s morale,” he says.“We had to do something. Our team was more alert than the cops. We recovered two AK 47s and couple of SLRs from the site, rest were blown up,” adds Kolha.He stresses that Maoists get their supply of arms and weapons from the raids and operations against police and other forces, and nothing is procured. “We are told to use the ammunitions cautiously and not to waste them. The seniors question us if there is wastage,” says Kolha. He was trained using AKs, SLR and other weapons in the forest of Maoist headquarters of Abhujmadh.Kolha now wants to shift his wife from his native Vikaspalli to police headquarters where he is living under armed security protection. “After marriage, I left her in the house to join the dalam. She would always question me due to her loneliness and I would console her. Now, I will try to convince her to be at my side,” said Kolha who dreams to start a family despite knowing his life is under high risk and death can come even with a slightest of mistake.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74501108,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-129045,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/maoist-movement-on-wane-in-gadchiroli-future-uncertain/articleshow/74501109.cms
62,['5/03/2020'],Mastermind of blast that killed 15 QRT jawans held,"Gadchiroli: Dinkar Gota, one of the key masterminds of Dadapur arson and the Jambhulkheda blast later that claimed the lives of 15 jawans and one civilian driver in May last year, was arrested along with his wife Sunanda from the outskirts of Gadchiroli on Wednesday. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) may seek Gota’s custody in near future for the probe into the Jambhulkheda blast case.

The couple had Rs18 lakh reward on them announced by the Maharashtra state. Some 36 vehicles had been torched by the Maoists at Dadapur in Kurkheda on May 1 last year, before they triggered the blast at Jambhulkheda when cops were heading to investigate the arson in a private vehicle. The Quick Response Team (QRT) was heading to Purada police station when their vehicle was blown up.

Gota, having 108 offences against him including 33 murders, was the Divisional Committee Member (DVCM) of north Gadchiroli division working with the Korchi dalam. The planning and execution of Dadapur arson and Jambhulkheda blast was done by Gota, his fellow DVCM Bhaskar Hichami and another company 4 top cadre Satish. Hichami and Satish are still absconding.

SP Shailesh Balkawade said Gadchiroli police have several offences to be probed against Gota but NIA may also start the process to get his custody in coming days. “NIA has already chargesheeted eight accused in Jambhulkheda blast case, and they may seek his custody too through legal process available to them,” he said.

Gota’s second wife Sunanda Koreti, working as member of Korchi dalaan, has 38 offences against her.

It’s learnt Gota had fallen out with senior cadres for his extra-marital affairs. He was seriously warned and also asked to improve his behaviour. The party had already started an inquiry against him and was likely to suspend him, which had prompted him to desert the group with Sunanda in September last year.

Sources stated Gota’s first wife Sunita, working with Tippagarh dalam, had surrendered last year after he grew close to Sunanda. It was after this that party seniors issued a strict warning to Gota to dissociate from Sunanda, which he did not like.

Balkawade said there was a strong rumour about Gota being bumped off by his own party men. “We were after him since he left the party. The arrest of Gota and his wife was the cumulative effort of the intelligence unit, technical cell and the Special Investigation Team (SIT) we formed last year after the Jambhulkheda blast,” he said.

Sources from Gadchiroli police said Gota and Sunanda were staying incognito in a village near the police headquarters. They felt no one would search for a senior cadre like him in or around the town. They were somehow eking out a living, and their use of mobile phones led the cops to them.

Balkawade said separate offences were registered for Dadapur arson and Jambhulkheda blast. “We have arrested Gota and Sunanda in the Dadapur arson case and took custody remand of 14 days from court,” he said.

Balkawade also added that now NIA may transfer Gota in the Jambhulkheda case too. “We had registered a case against almost 100 cadres of Maoists for the Dadapur arson,” he said.

In a separate action, also in the early hours of Wednesday, Gadchiroli police team busted a Maoist camp at Khobramenda forest in the northern side of the district. Around 70-80 Maoists were attending the camp when C-60 commandos stormed the place. The cadres managed to flee but police recovered substantial materials like mines, explosives and literature. Search operation is still underway.

After the arrests of Gota, and surrender of Maoists’ former commander-in-chief Vilas Kolha last week, the north Gadchiroli command is now with Hichami. “Twice Hichami had miraculous escapes in our firing. If he does not surrender immediately, he may not see 2021,” said Balkawade.

HOW JAMBHULKHEDA BLAST TOOK PLACE

1. Around 400-500 Maoists cadres, including more than 100 women, raided the Dadapur village in Kurkheda taluka in north Gadchiroli shortly after midnight of April 30, 2019, and torched 36 vehicles of a road construction company eill early morning on May 1 (4.30am)

2. Maoists left banners at Dadapur village condemning encounters at Kasnasur-Boriya that had killed 40 cadres

3. A Naxal action team, expert in explosions and blasts, was deployed in an ambush at Lendhari nullah near Jambhulkheda village in anticipation police would cross the spot on way to Dadapur village to investigate the arson

4. The then SDPO Shailesh Kale walked into the trap by ordering his Quick Response Team (QRT) to reach Dadapur at 9.30am

5. The 15-member QRT team left Kurkheda police post at 9.30am in a private vehicle driven by a civilian

6. Maoists triggered blast to blow up entire squad and the driver on small bridge over Lendhari nullah

7. Gadchiroli police arrested eight persons, including senior-most cadres like Narmada and her husband Kiran, before probe was handed over to NIA

The 100sqkm Koka sanctuary, which has several villages around it, is vulnerable to forest fires. Last year, over 50-hectare forest was burned in Koka.

Forest fire is a major issue in Maharashtra. According to information received under RTI, more than 4 lakh hectares of forest has been reduced to ashes in the last 10 years in the state.

Hence, NNTR and WWF-India organized a sensitization program on prevention of forest fire at Koka. Range forest officer (RFO) Sachin Jadhav has chalked out proactive measures to prevent forest fire this year.

Jadhav urged WWF-India’s Nagpur office to organize an awareness program on prevention of forest fire in villages where eco-development committees (EDCs) have been set up.

The program was organized in eight sensitive villages and two schools under the Koka range. Those who participated included senior citizens, youths and children.

Ajinkya Bhatkar, senior project officer, WWF-India, addressed villagers through a power point presentation and videos. He highlighted the fire in Amazon and Australia which impacted the entire world.

Bhatkar explained how forest fires impact the ecosystem. He urged people to make others aware about preventive measures to avoid forest fires and protect forests.

“A national movement needs to be launched to against forest fires. The forest department needs to be strengthened for firefighting. Without participation and the support of villagers, it is very difficult to save forests,” Bhatkar said.

The program was organized under the guidance of Poonam Pate, deputy director of NNTR. Round officers Rajendra Dhanvij and JG Nagpure and others coordinated with villagers.

Pate said, “During the tendu season, many fires are intentional. Forest fires don’t just destrpy trees. They kill and displace wildlife, alter water cycles and soil fertility and endanger the lives and livelihoods of local communities.”

Nagpur: MLC Parinay Fuke has alleged three districts— Nagpur, Bhandara and Gondia — Wainganga river and Gosikhurd dam are affected due to delay by Nagpur Metropolitan Region Development Authority ( NMRDA ) in preparing action plan to treat and reuse entire sewage generated from rural parts of Nagpur district.

Through calling attention motion in Legislative Council during ongoing budget session in Mumbai on Thursday, Fuke, a former guardian minister of Bhandara and Gondia, requested environment minister Aditya Thackeray to do the needful. Thackeray assured to resolve the problems.

Fuke said, “Three districts are affected to a great extent due to high-level pollution in Wainganga river and Gosikhurd dam. Always the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is blamed for polluting these water bodies. NMC is treating 330 of total 500 million litres per day (MLD) and one more sewage treatment plant (STP) of 150 MLD is in the pipeline.

“Over 400 MLD sewage is generated from villages and towns situated in rural parts of Nagpur district. Not a single drop of sewage is being treated in these parts. In 2016, I had directed NMRDA, which is authority for rural parts of the district, to prepare an action plan to develop mini STPs and ensure zero discharge. It would have made huge difference. Even, former CM Devendra Fadnavis had directed NMRDA to prepare action plan. But NMRDA has done nothing in last four years,” he said.

Acting Pro-VC Vinayak Deshpande told TOI, “the reference number of some five to six colleges was not generated which led to the exam section calling for details from colleges again. There was no data loss as it was preserved at several other places when the problem occured at one server. The summer exam has commenced and all admit cards and other formalities have been initiated smoothly,” he said.

Deshpande said he had called for details from the agency. The reference number is important to ascertain number of students and their colleges.

Though the acting Pro-VC reiterated there was no data loss and the glitch was restricted to only some colleges, the revelation that there was a problem in reference number indicates there has been something amiss with the exam forms.

On Wednesday, TOI spoke to a couple of colleges from city, Bhandara, and Gondia, they confirmed they had to resubmit sumer exam forms online. Some colleges had submitted hard copies from which the exam section made online entries on its own. They also said the problem had been encountered at all the 503 affiliated colleges without exception.

The bungle came to fore when the exam section forwarded a checklist around mid-January to cross check name of students, their colleges and courses. However, several names were missing.

On Jan 30, TOI was the first to report about the big data loss. Several Senate members representing the students and teachers said they too were aware of the bungle that was cleverly kept under wraps by exam section. They have placed questions about this event which is likely to be discussed during the Friday’s senate meeting.

Local intervention

Awareness drive

Infection protocol

Double check

Rumour-Busting

Border checks

KOCHI: In the beginning of February, Kerala had the first and only three confirmed cases of Covid-19 in India – three medical students who had returned from Wuhan in China, the epicentre of the disease. In less than a month, all three patients were treated successfully and discharged, as mandated, from isolation wards after testing negative twice in succession.Kerala has since been able to contain the spread of the virus through proactive protocols that seek to educate the general public about precautions to be taken without sounding unduly alarmist. Apart from carrying out a focused awareness campaign, the authorities have been quick to crack down on those spreading rumours about the outbreak.From immigration officials and police to panchayats and local-level health volunteers, a multi-tiered and seamlessly integrated system is in place. The following are some of the preventive measures initiated by the state government at the height of the coronavirus scare.Passengers arriving from abroad would be given a health card each in which they had to list their travel details and health condition. Before proceeding to immigration, they would need to get the details checked and stamped at a special desk. For passengers from China, Hong Kong or other coronavirus-affected regions, the protocol is to shift them to a transit room where their body temperature is immediately measured.Each of Kerala's five airports is linked to ambulance and emergency-response services in district hospitals. Any passenger who has fever, cough or sore throat is to be immediately shifted to the linked hospital and from there a message would be passed to the district medical office. This office immediately contacts the family members of the person and informs them about the isolation of the passenger. If the travellers have no symptoms, they are allowed to go home, subject to strict external surveillance by a health team.Immediately after the first case was detected, panchayat-level bodies across the state were issued a directive on infection-control and home isolation protocols. In a circular issued by the local self-government department, all local bodies were directed to prepare a list of people coming from places affected by the virus and of those in contact with such people. Multiple helplines were set up.The campaign focuses on basic hand and respiratory hygiene, including using a tissue or a flexed elbow to cover one's nose and mouth while coughing or sneezing. People have been advised to avoid handshakes and close contact with anyone suspected to have been infected. Standard prevention protocol also includes use of personal protective equipment, depending on riskAll private medical institutions, labs and consulting centres have been asked to strictly adhere to the recommended infection protocol. Around 215 mental health teams have reached out to 2,600 people in home quarantine to alleviate anxiety and also to counsel family members and people in the neighbourhood.Use of breathalysers has been temporarily suspended. Police personnel have been directed to use other methods such as medical examination to detect drink driving.Blood banks in all districts have implemented a mandatory precautionary measure to prevent transmission of the virus. They have commenced double screening of donors and stopped collecting blood samples from people who have recently arrived from abroad or those with a history of travel to foreign countries.

68,['5/03/2020'],"A yr on, NU restarts process to fill up 22 LIT teaching posts","Nagpur: More than a year after conducting recruitment drive for it, the Nagpur University (NU) is again initiating the process to fill up 22 vacant teaching posts at its premier institution, Laxminarayan Institute of Technology ( LIT ).

The posts lying vacant for several years now has stalled the process for grant of autonomy to LIT. The institute has been struggling to offer itself for a National Board of Accreditation (NBA) and NAAC assessments for the last few years because of shortage of teachers.

“Without the assessments, the NU can’t apply for autonomy,” said acting pro-VC Vinayak Deshpande.

In 2018, vice-chancellor SP Kane had also submitted a proposal for grant of deemed university status to LIT with the Union HRD ministry.

The latest measure came following directives from the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court which ordered the VC and pro-VC to discuss the issue with the secretary of higher education and prepare a plan for removing the deficiencies by March 30.

Led by the secretary, a committee comprising VC, pro-VC, director (higher education) and director (technical education) has been asked to frame modalities, set a timeline and decide how it will be done.

Last week, the VC, pro-VC and LIT director Raju Mankar met higher education secretary Saurabh Vijay in Mumbai, following which the NU authorities started preparing a fresh proposal. “We are seeking 22 posts,” Deshpande said.

There are indications of a change in the roster. In a series of reports last year, TOI had highlighted staff imbalance at LIT.

During the 2019 recruitment drive, the NU had overlooked the staffing imbalance and advertised posts with hardly any workload. Lack of teachers for core subjects were ignored which ultimately made LIT again ineligible for NBA despite filling up 11 out of the 17 posts.

As per the old roster, the institute has 62 sanctoined teaching posts. A recent GR of technical education has also mandated 1:20 teacher-student ratio as per AICTE norms. This could also be another reason for modifying the roster.

Officials said as per government policy, only 80% of the teaching posts sought are approved like the last time when NU had sought around 29, but was given only 17. “This time, since it is being done in response to the HC order, LIT may get more posts,” they said.

Lack of qualified applicants too is a major challenge before NU to fulfil the dream of making LIT autonomous institution. For a long time, there were no applications for chemical technology specialization such as petrochemical, paper pulp, surface coating and oil technology.

The six posts that didn’t find any takers last time are from chemical technology. Professor and associate professor level posts are vacant which makes it more difficult to find a suitable candidate. Those possessing the requisite experience for these posts are generally well settled and need a strong reason to come to Nagpur, say insiders.

69,['5/03/2020'],Corporator Syeda Khatun disqualified over invalid caste certificate,"Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday disqualified city corporator Syeda Khatun upholding the claim of petitioner Kamil Ansari who had challenged validity of the OBC caste certificate submitted by her. This decision by the bench headed by Justices RK Deshpande and AB Borkar now means the seat held by Khatu, Ward No 8-B, is to be considered vacant.

Polls for Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) were held in 2017 and Khatun was declared winner from 8-B seat which was reserved for OBC candidate. Petitioner Ansari had then claimed her caste certificate was invalid and filed a complaint with Election Commission of India (ECI).

The certificate was put before a scrutiny committee that upheld it. Ansari then approached the court through his lawyer Narayan Phadnis. Phadnis argued the certificate issued in 2011 by district deputy collector was not valid and was in fact a non-creamy layer certificate. Phadnis said Khatun had claimed her OBC status under Jullaha community (weaver), but the documentation was not in order.

Jemini Kasat, counsel for NMC and ECI, said the deputy collector had mentioned in an affidavit the certificate issued on June 8, 2011 only pertained to non-creamy layer status. The court held that respondent had failed to bring on record any caste certificate.

If you have already consulted a medical professional, it would be beneficial to also get her Blood thyroid and LFT ( liver function tests) tests done. Ascertain whether her health parameters are growing in accordance with age. Enquire if any external stressors may be resulting in her feeling anxious or low and thus a loss of appetite. Also try to keep the home environment relatively stress free. What we also need to remember is to not obsess about food and not make it the sole focus of all conversations. It may be helpful to negotiate with her and make a food chart that involves a healthy diet as well as items that she is fond of. Positively reinforce healthy eating habits.

76,['5/03/2020'],"State stops cattle, human kill payouts sans budgeted funds","Nagpur: The finance department move to discontinue negative budgeting to pay compensation to kin of victims killed in wild animal attacks has become a cause of concern for officials.

In 2011-12, a scheme was introduced in budget distribution system (BDS), which allowed payment for cattle kills, crop damage and human kills by wild animals even if budget in the head showed zero balance.

The state government pays Rs 15 lakh compensation to kin of victims of wild animal attacks. If there is limited budget, and if funds lapsed, still there was a provision to pay money to the kin of victims, but finance department has withdrawn this facility.

The facility has been withdrawn by the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for the last month. This has led to compensation cases remaining pending. In 2019-20, the budget outlay for human and cattle kills and crop damage compensation was Rs 40 crore.

As per official figures, from April 1, 2019, to January 31, 2020, the state paid Rs 4.95 crore towards human kills, Rs 7.17 crore towards 7,698 cattle kills, and Rs 9.20 crore towards 26,416 cases of crop damage. As the scheme has been withdrawn, no compensation has been paid for cases in February.

“Delayed compensation to victims’ kin will not only create problem for forest officials, who face the music from affected villagers, but it will also increase revenge killing of wild animals, including tigers and leopards,” said senior officials.

Senior forest officials said, “This scheme has been withdrawn temporarily. Owing to increase in man-animal conflict cases, negative budgeting was needed. We have apprised forest minister Sanjay Rathod about it. We are also speaking to the finance ministry not to withdraw the scheme.”

Chandrapur and Bramhapuri in Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) landscape are the worst man-animal affected areas. In Bramhapuri alone, 4,800 cases for crop damage, cattle kills and human deaths are pending. “We need to pay over Rs 2 crore in Bramhapuri alone,” officials said.

The 15 paintings include rare works by M F Husain and Manjit Bawa.He approached HC after Supreme Court was not inclined to entertain his plea last week. He challenged the constitutional validity of the newly-amended provisions of PMLA section 3, which dispenses with intent and knowledge of possession of tainted money to establish possession of proceeds of crime and enabling their attachment from hands of third parties.Rohin’s counsel Amit Desai sought a stay on the auction, arguing that the paintings belonging to the trust cannot be “proceeds of crime” and were not owned by Nirav. The paintings purchased from trust funds in 2006 cannot be proceeds of crime which allegedly took place in 2011, said his petition.ED counsel H S Venegaokar said the online auctions only for nonpaintings began on Wednesday, and paintings will be auctioned live on March 5 in Mumbai.HC observed that though he turned 18 last May, he affirmed his affidavit last month, with no attempt to justify the “late approach” to court. Rohin had affirmed his affidavit for his petition, in New York on February 26, his petition showed.Rohin contended that he resides in US and was unaware of the proposed auction till January 21, when he read news that ED had sought to auction movable assets, particularly paintings, alleging that they belong to Nirav and firms he controls. Rohin’s plea said ED never intimated him about the attachment or auction, so he never approached any court earlier.ED, represented by additional solicitor general Anil Singh, said Nirav and his wife Amy were trustees and it had only two beneficiaries, which included her (90% shares) and Rohin (10%). He opposed the plea for a stay, saying the auction was given publicity internationally too since January 2020, and Rohin could not claim ignorance now. He added that the trust was set up over 15 years ago with Rs 1,000 but within a few days had purchased Samudra Mahal for about Rs 24 crore.HC said it would hear the matter next on March 23, as the affidavit would have to be filed by ED.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74484492,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-335680,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-high-court-refuses-to-stay-ed-auction-as-nirav-modis-son-insists-paintings-belong-to-a-trust/articleshow/74484355.cms
79,['5/03/2020'],"CBSE allows face masks, sanitizers inside exam halls","Nagpur: The CBSE has decided to allow face masks and hand sanitizers inside examination halls for the ongoing board exam, as precautionary measure for novel coronavirus.

State school education minister Varsha Gaikwad told TOI that she will meet health department officials on Thursday and take a decision on issuing similar guidelines. CBSE is extremely strict about the items students are allowed to carry inside, but in the view of the anxiety over the virus, it decided to relent.

Board secretary Anurag Tripathi issued a statement late on Wednesday evening stating that students will be allowed to carry these items inside “if they so desire”.

CBSE’s Std XII accountancy paper is scheduled to start at 10.30am on Thursday. Soon after Tripathi’s statement, CBSE’s director (academics) Joseph Emmanuel issued a detailed circular about the need for schools to create awareness about coronavirus.

The circular talked about the importance of taking simple precautions like washing hands with soap, covering face while sneezing etc. Emmanuel directed principals to “take initiatives to teach children these simple public health measures that will go a long way in preventing spread of novel coronavirus”.

Centre Point Group of schools made an early attempt to address the issue by sending a notice to all parents about precautions to be taken specifically for coronavirus. The school made it clear to parents that any student with dry cough or nasal congestion should rather stay at home.

The school also suggested that any child whose parents have been certain to specific countries must get themselves checked for the virus. Many other schools have stepped in with other measures like teachers talking to kids during their regular classes or announcements during assembly.

CBSE’s pro-activeness is being appreciated by schools who said that ‘it is better to be safe than sorry’. Pravin Tiwari, director of Central India Public School, said “This is a good decision by CBSE and will help in strengthening precautionary measures.”

Inderpreet Singh Tuli, director of Edify School, said “I am happy that CBSE has taken this decision as it will be good for students, specifically in those cities where confirmed cases have been found.”

Dr Rajiv Mohta, a senior medical practitioner and adolescent counsellor, said “This is a very good decision by CBSE because during exams, students are sitting in an enclosed place. Students should continue wearing the masks while giving the exam and ensure that it is of good medical quality.”

83,['5/03/2020'],Weather unlikely to stall spread of virus,"NEW DELHI: Some experts believe that the spread of coronavirus may be slowed down under hot weather conditions , but the forecast till March 12 doesn’t throw up any relief on that front as there is no prediction of any increase in temperature in the next few days.

Though seasonal forecast of India Meteorological Department (IMD) for March-April-May talks of “warmer than normal” temperature over northwest, west, central and parts of south India, it predicts “below normal (2-5°Celsius in general) maximum day temperatures” over major parts of the Indian mainland during the March 6-12 period.

Coronavirus outbreak: Complete coverage

In its weekly update, released on February 27, the IMD had, however, predicted that while temperatures would be “above normal” (by 2-3°Celsius) on March 5 in the north and parts of south India, it would be “below normal” (3-4 degree Celsius) in the rest of the country including central and northeast India.

There is even a prediction of fairly widespread rainfall over Punjab , Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and UP during March 5-7 period. Most parts of central and east India (Bihar, Jharkhand , Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Gangetic West Bengal) too may have similar conditions during the period — it means there is low possibility of a rise in temperatures there in next two days. More clarity on the trajectory of temperature rise will be available in the next update on Thursday.

85,['5/03/2020'],Coronavirus Delhi News: Why healthcare staff can’t mask their anxiety,"NEW DELHI: One of the most defining moments in the fight against Covid-19 in China was the death of Dr Li Wenliang, the doctor who made the presence of the infection public, due to the same virus. Last week, his colleague, Dr Mi Wenliang, also fell prey to novel coronavirus, underlining the risks faced by healthcare workers treating infected individuals.The data shows 1,700 medical workers have been infected by Covid-19 in China and at least six have succumbed to it.Though no healthcare worker has been affected in India, the anxiety level among the staff at hospitals such as Safdarjung and Ram Manohar Lohia, where coronavirus patients are being treated, is high.Some of the doctors TOI spoke to said the lack of personal protective equipment such as masks was the trigger behind such anxieties. “Till Tuesday, there were few N95 masks for doctors at our hospital. We managed with surgical masks. When we complained to the administration, they arranged for some N95 masks and said more would be arranged in a phased manner because suppliers don’t have enough masks,” said Dr Joyutpal Biswas, general secretary of the Resident Doctors’ Association (RDA) of Safdarjung Hospital, a nodal centre for Covid-19.For now, doctors working in the casualty, respiratory medicine unit and other departments dealing with patients coming with complaints of fever, cough and breathing difficulty are getting N95 masks. “The positive, as well as suspected cases of Covid-19, are being admitted in a separate isolation ward. Doctors going there have full gear of personal protective equipment (PPE),” he added.The RDA of AIIMS has also written to the director of the hospital for appropriate and adequate protective equipment without any interruption in their supply.The World Health Organization recommends that healthcare workers, including doctors and nurses, use surgical masks to cover their mouths and noses but the US’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has instructed them to wear N95 masks, which are thicker than the surgical masks and fit more tightly. In the US, too, masks shortage has been reported due to panic buying and hoarding.A senior doctor at RML Hospital, another nodal centre for Covid-19, said they were a little more careful than usual these days. “If a patient comes with cough, we ask them to wear masks before examining. We are wearing masks, too,” she said, adding that the risk for healthcare workers was always high in case of any disease outbreak. “We don’t have a choice. But we also know how to deal with them.”Dr Rommel Tickoo, senior consultant of internal medicine at Max Saket, said the chances of people getting seriously ill due to the virus were rare.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74484475,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-148360,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/coronavirus-scare-why-healthcare-staff-cant-mask-their-anxiety/articleshow/74484438.cms

This comes following a preliminary nod from municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi, which came on Wednesday.The five-day week will not apply to those involved in proving and tackling emergency services like fire brigade, drainage operations, sewer and health services. A senior BMC official said in case of any major mishap or flood-like situation in the city, officials have to stay back in office or be on standby. “This will still be applicable and the five-day week will only be for office staff at such times who are not involved in handling emergency services,” said a official. There are over one lakh BMC employees, of which over 3,000 work at the civic headquarters.The decision to have a five-day week will also mean that civic staff will have to put in extra hours of work. Unlike now, when employees work from 10.30am-5.30pm in BMC, with a second and fourth Saturday being a holiday, now they will have to work from 9.30am-6.30pm daily, with Saturday and Sunday being holidays officially.A draft proposal was tabled before the civic chief and he sanctioned the change in employees’ timings. There were plans to reduce casual leave days of 15 that municipal employees get in a year to eight. But no decision has been taken on that yet.Members of the civic body’s Kamgar Sanghtana met Pardeshi on Wednesday, demanding that casual leave not be reduced. Sukhdev Kashid, president, Municipal Engineers’ Association, who was at the meeting, said, “The commissioner was positive about not reducing casual leave but a final decision will be taken in a few days, he informed us.”As per protocol, the proposal will now be tabled before the civic general body meeting for final approval. It is most likely that the proposal will come up for discussion and approval at Thursday’s meeting itself, said officials. “We are not expecting resistance from elected representatives over the proposal, and are hoping that it is smoothly cleared, so that the five-day week can be applicable from this week itself,” said a civic official.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74484544,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-894476,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/after-government-employees-bmc-staff-likely-to-enjoy-five-day-week/articleshow/74484525.cms

MUMBAI: Flyers arriving even indirectly from Italy and Iran will now be screened for Covid-19 at Indian airports. Those coming directly from the two countries and from airports in East Asia are already being screened for the new coronavirus. The DGCA in its latest circular has thus extended the ambit of medical screening to passengers arriving from Italy and Iran via transit hubs, mainly Dubai , Doha and Abu Dhabi.

In a report on Tuesday, TOI had raised concerns that exempting passengers from Iran and Italy who fly into India after transit halts could pose problems as transit airports. The DGCA said in its latest circular, “Passengers (foreign and Indian) arriving directly or indirectly from China, South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy, Hong Kong , Macau, Vietnam , Malaysia, Indonesia, Nepal, Thailand and Singapore must undergo medical screening at the port of entry.”

143,['5/03/2020'],Chinese language course finds no takers in Bengaluru,"A girl wearing a mask due to Coronavirus in Bengaluru

BENGALURU: One spot where the people of Bengaluru can feel the pulse of the world is the Centre for Global Languages (CGL) at Bengaluru Central University . When a massive earthquake and a tsunami hit Japan in 2011 crippling the country’s economy, the CGL saw a massive dip in enrolment for learning Japanese.

Now, history seems to be repeating itself; this time it’s the Chinese language. CGL, whose four-month programmes for foreign languages are beginning this Saturday, hasn’t received a single student for Chinese language. The department thinks the low enrolment is the ripple effect of coronavirus and the resultant travel ban to China.

“The department can spot global trends in the economy in its enrolment. We saw it with Japan nine years ago. Usually, Chinese language is in demand with around 15-20 students joining the programme every time. However, this season saw only a couple of queries and zero enrolment. Coronavirus and the resultant travel ban to China in near future could be the reason. We also feel Italian and French have taken a beating because of the slowdown in the economy,” said Jyothi Venkatesh , coordinator, CGL. There are no takers for Italian and only 25 for French.

The four-month programme for Chinese language is usually attended by people with business background, who want to fix deals in China and also by IT company employees. Japanese too draws a lot of students, thanks to employment opportunities there.

The languages offered under the four-month weekend programmes include French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Finnish, Russian and Arabic. We hope things will be back to normal by the time the June batch begins,” said Jyothi.

CHENNAI: A special team has detained two people, including a college dropout, for Tuesday's crude bomb attack on Anna Salai that investigators believe was an attempt on the lives of history-sheeters 'CD' Mani and 'Kakkathoppu' Balaji.

Five special teams have been formed to nab the others, said an officer. The attack could be the start of a 'war', he said, based on statements from detained suspects D Mahesh and Akash.

A case was registered under Sections 3 of Explosive Substances Act and 4 of TN Public Property Act.

Mani and Balaji were returning from a George Town court in a Toyota Fortuner when two crude bombs, hurled from across the median, narrowly missed the vehicle. At least eight men on four bikes, who had been following the car for more than 5km, launched the attack just metres from the Teynampet police station. Police said RTO documents confirmed the car was registered in the name of Mani.

A lawyer was with the two history-sheeters in the car whose driver managed to weave through the mass of vehicles on the busy road and escape.

Police later tracked Mahesh, a college dropout, and Akash, residents of Periya Rajapillai Thottam slum in T Nagar, with the help of their bike registration numbers. The two told police the plan was to hurl bombs at the car and bring it to a stop near Teynampet. A few more people of the gang, who were waiting in a car, would then rush to the Fortuner and finish off Mani and Balaji, police said.

Officers said the attack is over a multi-crore rupee real estate deal in the suburbs. Mani, who specialises in 'double documentation' and is facing several cases having usurped several properties illegally, escaped at least two attempts on his life and tried to eliminate a rival named Maha on at least two occasions.

North Chennai-based Sembakkam Radha and 'Sambo' Senthil, with links to Tuticorin-based gangs, often interfered in Mani's real estate business and the gangs were locked in a bitter rivalry, an officer said.

The 15 paintings include rare works by M F Husain and Manjit Bawa . He approached HC after Supreme Court was not inclined to entertain his plea last week.He challenged the constitutional validity of the newly-amended provisions of PMLA section 3, which dispenses with intent and knowledge of possession of tainted money to establish possession of proceeds of crime and enabling their attachment from hands of third parties. Rohin’s sought a stay on the auction, arguing that the paintings purchased from trust funds in 2006 cannot be proceeds of crime which allegedly took place in 2011.ED counsel H S Venegaokar said the paintings will be auctioned live on March 5 in Mumbai. HC observed that though he turned 18 last May, he affirmed his affidavit last month, with no attempt to justify the “late approach” to court. Rohin had affirmed his affidavit for his petition in New York on February 26, his petition showed.Rohin contended that he resides in US and was unaware of the proposed auction till January 21, when he read news that ED had sought to auction movable assets, particularly paintings, alleging that they belong to Nirav and firms he controls. Rohin’s plea said ED never intimated him about the attachment or auction, so he never approached any court earlier. HC said it would hear the matter next on March 23, as the affidavit would have to be filed by ED.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74484703,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-384220,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nirav-modis-son-says-paintings-belong-to-trust-but-hc-refuses-to-stay-ed-sale/articleshow/74484708.cms

A Cartier Asymmetric Crash Wristwatch and Porsche Panamera were auctioned for Rs 36 lakh each, while a Louis Vuitton cabin trunk went for Rs 8.6 lakh.

While the online auction was conducted on Wednesday, the live auction conducted by SaffronArt on behalf of Enforcement Directorate, will be held on Thursday at the auction house’s Mumbai gallery. On March 3, before the online auction opened for bids, SaffronArt received more than 700 advance bids. The total number of bids in the auction was reportedly 300% higher than a standard online auction.

Last March, SaffronArt had conducted an auction of some artwork belonging to Modi that fetched over Rs 55 crore.

Among artwork under the hammer on Thursday are Amrita Sher-Gil ’s Boys with Lemons (1935) estimated at Rs 12-18 crore and appearing on the auction market for the first time. M F Husain’s 1972 work Battle of Ganga and Jamuna: Mahabharata 12 is also being auctioned for the same amount.

CHENNAI: A stalker slashed the throat of a Class VIII student who resisted his advances at Aminjikarai on Wednesday afternoon. Neighbours rushed the 13-year-old girl to the Kilpauk Medical College Hospital where her condition is stable. Police are searching for the 26-year-old stalker who fled the scene.

Police said the man, Nithyanathan, and the girl lived in the same building where he ran an eatery on the ground floor. The girl and her parents have been living on the first floor for the past six years. Nithyanathan had been stalking the girl for months now despite being warned on several occasions.

Around 12.30pm on Wednesday, when the girl returned home after writing her exams at a government school in Shenoy Nagar, the man intercepted her and pressed his suit again. She ignored him and went to her house, but he followed her.

Neighbours heard the girl crying for help and rushed to her side. By then, a police officer said, the man had slashed her throat after sexually abusing her; there was no one else in the house at the time. In the melee, Nithyanathan managed to escape.

Police said Nithyanathan had been stalking the minor for the past several months, though she kept ignoring him. Some three months ago he proposed to her and she turned him down.

The girl told her parents what had happened and they warned the man off. They also told his father, Rajendran, that Nithyanathan was troubling their daughter. Police said his parents too had reprimanded the man for his behaviour.

Police said Nithyanathan persisted with his advances and on Wednesday assaulted the girl taking advantage of the fact that she was alone at home.

Police have launched a hunt for Nithyanathan who has switched off his mobile phone. The Anna Nagar all-women police have registered cases of attempt to murder and under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act against Nithyanathan.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

150,['5/03/2020'],Can’t deny insurance claim over driver’s fake licence: SC,"Supreme Court of India

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that an insurance company cannot deny claim to the owner of a vehicle involved in a road accident if his driver had falsely claimed to be holding a valid driving licence by producing a fake document.

A bench of Justices Navin Sinha and Krishna Murari said it would not be possible for any owner to make inquiries with regional transport offices all over the country to ascertain the veracity of the driving licence, particularly when he has no reason to doubt its veracity. The SC said wilful breach of the conditions of the insurance policy should be established to deny claim to the insured.

“While hiring a driver, the employer is expected to verify if the driver has a driving licence. If the driver produces a licence which on the face of it looks genuine, the employer is not expected to further investigate into the authenticity of the licence unless there is cause to believe otherwise. If the employer finds the driver to be competent to drive the vehicle and has satisfied himself that the driver has a driving licence there would be no breach of Section 149(2)(a)(ii) and the insurance company would be liable under the policy,” it said.

Breach of conditions under Section 149(2)(a) of the Motor Vehicles Act absolves the insurer of its liability to the insured. The section deals with the conditions regarding driving licence. In case the vehicle at the time of accident is driven by a person who is not duly licensed or by a person who has been disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence during the period of disqualification, the insurer is not liable for compensation.

The bench said it would not amount to breach of the section when the owner was himself deceived by his driver. “It would be unreasonable to place such a high onus on the insured to make inquiries with RTOs all over the country to ascertain the veracity of the driving licence. However, if the insurance company is able to prove that the owner/insured was aware or had noticed that the licence was fake or invalid and still permitted the person to drive, the insurance company would no longer continue to be liable,” it said.

The apex court set aside order of National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which had absolved an insurance company of its liability since no record of the licence of the driver was found with the licensing authority. In this case, the insured vehicle met with an accident with a tractor as a result of which the owner of the vehicle and his daughter died. United India Insurance Company , however, turned down the claim filed by his wife on the ground that the driver did not have a proper driving licence at the time of the accident.

151,['5/03/2020'],"After Donald Trump tour, US defence secretary to visit India next week to boost ties","US secretary of defence Mark Esper (AFP)

NEW DELHI: Close after President Donald Trump ’s visit to India last month, the US secretary of defence Mark Esper is now slated to touch down in New Delhi on March 15 to discuss specific measures to further strengthen the already expansive military cooperation between the two countries.

Sources said Esper will hold discussions on a wide array of issues with defence minister Rajnath Singh on March 16, including the decision taken during Trump’s visit to conclude the fourth and final bilateral foundational military pact called the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geo-Spatial Cooperation (BECA) as early as possible.

Trump’s visit on February 24-25 also saw the inking of two deals worth $3 billion for 24 MH-60 `Romeo’ naval helicopters and six Apache attack choppers, which has taken the total value of lucrative Indian defence deals bagged by the US to over $21 billion just since 2007.

The two countries have already held a couple of rounds to discuss BECA, which will enable the US to share advanced satellite and topographical data for long-range navigation and missile-targeting with India.

India had inked the first foundational agreement called General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) with the US in 2002. But the previous UPA regime had stonewalled all attempts by the US to push for the other pacts during its 10-year tenure because it said they could “compromise” India’s strategic autonomy.

But the NDA government had gone ahead to ink the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016 and then the Communications , Compatibility and Security Arrangement (COMCASA) in 2018, with India-specific safeguards in both.

While LEMOA provides for reciprocal logistics support like refueling and berthing facilities for each other's warships and aircraft, COMCASA has paved the way for India to get greater access to advanced military technologies with encrypted and secure communications and data links like armed Predator-B or Sea Guardian drones.

Trump, during his visit here, had also strongly pitched for the US to become India’s “premier defence partner” by providing it with the most advanced weapon systems like armed drones that are “feared” across the globe.

As was first reported by TOI, India has finalized the plan to acquire 30 weaponised Sea Guardians, with 10 drones each for the Navy, IAF and Army to hunt and destroy targets on land and sea. “The three Services have virtually finalized their qualitative requirements for the specific payloads and equipment fit for their drones,” said a source.

NEW DELHI: As the number of Covid-19 cases mounts, preparations are on in full swing in five hospitals run by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) to deal with the situation.

Hindu Rao and Kasturba hospitals have already created two wards each to isolate patients. Three others - Rajan Babu TB Hospital, Balak Ram Hospital and Maharishi Valmiki Infectious Disease Hospital - will set up similar facilities, an official told TOI .

Ashok Rawat, medical health officer of north corporation, said: ""We may also create space to quarantine patients, besides setting up isolation wards at Balak Ram Hospital. But our main focus will be on information dissemination. We have around 5 lakh posters ready to be displayed in government offices.""

Rawat maintained that while there was nothing to panic about, the public lead to support the efforts being made by the authorities. ""For the last two and a half weeks, our department has been regularly taking details of foreigners staying at hotels and motels under its jurisdiction. We are sharing the same with the surveillance teams appointed by Delhi government. We are following the directions issued by both the Centre and the state government,"" he said.

North corporation standing committee chairman Jai Prakash, meanwhile, convened a meeting of officials to assess their readiness to deal with the situation.

In south Delhi, Delhi government's surveillance teams joined hands with south corporation officials to disinfect hotels where the tourists from Italy had been staying during their visit to the city. Kejriwal said the passengers who had come from Italy had stayed at Surya hotel in New Friends Colony. ""Around 13-14 rooms of the hotel have been sealed to ensure that the rooms are properly sanitised. The same steps have been taken at The Grand hotel where they stayed afterwards,"" he said.

SDMC has, meanwhile, decided to discontinue the morning assembly at primary schools. Biometric attendance has also been suspended at its schools and offices.

""Like north corporation, we are also collecting information about foreigners visiting city hotels. Details of people suspected to have acquired the viral infection are being communicated to surveillance teams,"" a SDMC official said. He added that no cases had been reported in areas under SDMC jurisdiction so far.

Doctors from SDMC's health department will participate in a joint training session to be organised by the Centre on March 6. At least 35 unipoles in its jurisdiction have been used to share information about the disease, another official said.

The court said the rule requiring a person to file an application/affidavit stating the reasons for seeking the information is not inconsistent with the provisions of the RTI Act but merely lays down a different procedure like payment of fees etc for obtaining information.

“This would involve wastage of both time and fiscal resources which the preamble of the RTI Act itself intends to avoid,” it said.

NEW DELHI: The sudden ‘flight’ of Congress MLAs and the return of some of them to the party fold seems linked to a war of nerves with BJP over the third seat in the Rajya Sabha polls in Madhya Pradesh with the saffron camp looking to undercut the rival’s edge and roil the already tense factional equations in the Congress camp.

While Congress functionaries declared that the MLAs who had gone to Gurgaon had returned, there was a degree of uncertainty over four who were reported to be in Bengaluru. The skirmish, BJP sources said, was related to the Rajya Sabha polls but the results could have a bearing on the government’s stability.

As of now, the crisis seems to have ebbed with Congress MLAs back in Bhopal. But the episode will give the Congress camp food for thought, as it might also impinge on the race for Rajya Sabha nominations with camp followers of senior members Digvijay Singh and Jyotiraditya Scindia expecting a seat for the two.

While both BJP and Congress can win a seat each, they are short for the third one that is up for grabs. Congress needs two MLAs while BJP’s shortfall is greater at around seven. In the unfolding mind games, Congress sources exuded confidence that they could get four BJP MLAs to cross vote. But still, between the candidatures of Singh and Scindia, there could be a tussle on who would be fielded for the assured seat.

BJP state unit chief V D Sharma said BJP was not to blame for the upheavals in Congress which he said were linked to an internal tussle and chief minister Kamal Nath , Scindia and Singh could provide the answers. Party MP Ganesh Singh said, “Congress is not able to decide who to give the ticket — Digvijay Singh, Jyotiraditya Scindia or Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.”

BJP sources were cautious is reading anything beyond the approaching Rajya Sabha elections, saying the situation was fluid with both sides shoring up defences and looking for vulnerabilities in the other side. As things stand, Congress seemed to have managed a rearguard action after being taken by surprise.

Senior Congress member Vivek Tankha pointed to resentments in MP Congress giving BJP an opportunity. “There is no communication with the high command or the low command. An independent state president should be appointed immediately which has not happened for a year. Congress workers are waiting for appointments in organisation and in corporations. They have to have a sense of belonging in their government,” he said.

In the 230-member assembly, Congress has 114 MLAs, followed by BJP with 107. The simple majority mark is 116. The Congress-led government has the support of four Independent MLAs, two Bahujan Samaj Party legislators and one of the Samajwadi Party .

158,['5/03/2020'],NCRB’s use of facial recognition tool no privacy breach: Government,"NEW DELHI: The home ministry informed Rajya Sabha on Wednesday that the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) had been authorised to use automated facial recognition system (AFRS) for identification of criminals, unclaimed bodies and missing and found persons. It, however, insisted that this would not violate privacy, as AFRS would rely solely on police records and could be accessed only by law enforcement agencies.

Minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy, in a written reply to a question on AFRS, said approval had been accorded for AFRS implementation by the NCRB.

As per the NCRB proposal, AFRS shall facilitate identification of criminals, unidentified bodies and lost and found persons through easy recording, analysis, retrieval and sharing of information between different organisations. AFRS will be a mobile and web application hosted in NCRB’s (which manages data for police) data centre in Delhi but used by all police stations in the country.

The NCRB plans to integrate AFRS with multiple databases like crime and criminal tracking network & systems (CCTNS), integrated criminal justice system, state-specific database systems and khoya-paya portal managed by the bureau.

CCTNS is a country-wide integrated database on crime incidents and suspects that interlinks FIRs, investigations, and chargesheets of all police stations. .

Integrated criminal justice system is any computer network that allows justice practitioners and agencies to electronically access and share information between systems and across jurisdictional lines. Khoya-paya portal is a citizen-based website to exchange information on missing and found children.

Cyber experts have cautioned against potential abuse of facial recognition technology as a tool of control and the risk it poses to citizens’ privacy and data in the absence of a data protection law.

159,['5/03/2020'],Day 3: Parliament logjam continues,"Parliament was disrupted for the third consecutive day on Wednesday

NEW DELHI: Parliament was disrupted for the third consecutive day on Wednesday over the Delhi riots even as Lok Sabha passed a bill providing an opportunity to taxpayers to settle disputes by paying just the overdue taxes with complete waiver of interest and penalty by March 31.

The Direct Tax Vivaad Se Vishwas Bill, 2020, was passed amid din without any discussion as the opposition continued to protest while demanding an immediate discussion on the Delhi riots. Rajya Sabha too witnessed similar protests, forcing Chairman Venkaiah Naidu to adjourn the House for the day within 10 minutes of it opening at 11 am.

In Lok Sabha, it was necessary to pass the bill at the earliest as the last date to avail waiver of interest and penalty under it is March 31.

As many as 4.83 lakh direct tax cases involving Rs 9.32 lakh crore are pending in various appellate forums such as commissioner (appeals), ITAT, high courts, Supreme Court and Debt Recovery Tribunals.

Under the proposed scheme, taxpayers willing to settle disputes will be allowed a complete waiver of interest and penalty if they pay the entire amount of tax in dispute by March 31, following which an additional 10% disputed tax will have to be paid over and above the tax liability. The scheme will remain open till June 30. The scheme can be availed once the bill is passed by Parliament.

Lok Sabha started without Speaker Om Birla in the chair and continued through two adjournments before the final one for the day came minutes after it reopened at 2 pm. At 11 am, the House opened with Kirit Solanki in the chair. Birla stayed out all day.

With opposition parties demanding a discussion on the Delhi violence, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said it could be taken up on March 11 in Lok Sabha and on March 12 in Rajya Sabha. But the opposition continued with its demand and kept storming into the well chanting slogans like ‘Modi sarkar shame shame’, ‘Pradhan mantri jawab do’.

The Indian Institute of Information Technology (Amendment) Bill, 2020, was also introduced in Lok Sabha. It seeks to confer the status of institution of national importance on five IIITs — set up on public-private partnership mode in Surat, Bhopal, Bhagalpur , Agartala and Raichur.

161,['5/03/2020'],All-India judicial service? 50% of HCs object to plan,"Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad

NEW DELHI: More than 50% of high courts in the country have opposed the Centre’s proposal to constitute an All India Judicial Service to recruit judges at the level of district judges. The Centre’s proposal has been pending since 2012 when it had suggested creation of an all-India service on the lines of recruitment of IAS/IPS officers by the Union Public Service Commission.

At least 15 of the 25 HCs and state governments of Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh , Meghalaya, Nagaland and Punjab have objected to the Centre’s proposal, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told Lok Sabha on Wednesday.

The minister, however, argued in favour of constitution of a centralised recruitment authority for district judges. “In government’s view, a properly framed All India Judicial Service (AIJS) is important to strengthen overall justice delivery system. This will give an opportunity for induction of suitably qualified fresh legal talent selected through a proper all-India merit selection system as well as address the issue of social inclusion by enabling suitable representation to marginalised and deprived sections of society,” he said in his written reply to a question.

Prasad said the HCs of Sikkim and Tripura had concurred with the proposal approved by a committee of secretaries for formation of AIJS. The HCs of Allahabad, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala , Manipur, Meghalaya, Orissa and Uttarakhand suggested changes in age at the induction level, qualifications, training and quota of vacancies to be filled through AIJS. “Rests of the high courts have not favoured the idea,” he said.

The reason, the minister said, was that most HCs did not want to cede administrative control over the subordinate judiciary. While the HCs of Jharkhand and Rajasthan indicated that the matter was under consideration, HCs of Calcutta, J&K and Gauhati are yet to respond to the Centre’s proposal.

CHENNAI: For the past seven years, Yeshwanth Kumar has been spending six hours a day in the kitchen - carving fruits and vegetables, creating food sculptures and cooking. And in February this year, his efforts paid off as the 16-year-old won four silver medals at the IKA/Culinary Olympics 2020 , held in Stuttgart, Germany.

The oldest, largest and most diverse international culinary arts competition in the world, the IKA/Culinary Olympics is held once in four years. ""The last time I participated, I won the fourth place in fruit and vegetable carving. So I spent the last four years preparing for this Olympics, and even went to the Czech Republic, China, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam for advanced training,"" says Yeshwanth, who won silver medals in four categories this year - classical vegetable and fruit carving, live vegetable and fruit carving, artistry made from pastillage and gum paste.

To participate in the Culinary Olympics, chefs have to go through a parent organisation such as South India Chef's Association (SICA) or the Indian Federation of Culinary Associations (IFCA).

Teams from any recognised culinary college or institute are eligible to participate.

""Participants have to bear the ticket fare and pay the registration fee, which is 100 euros for each event. Once they are there, the food and accommodation is taken care of,"" says chef Damu, president, SICA, which felicitated Yeshwanth and gave him Rs 1 lakh as a token of appreciation. ""Last time, seven teams from India participated but this time, though four teams were supposed to go, only Yeshwanth participated from India because of the coronavirus threat and also the expense involved.""

Yeshwanth's love for the culinary arts began at a very young age as his father, Umasankar Dhanapal, is also a chef.

""I used to watch him teach students and was inspired to take it up as a career,"" says Yeshwanth, whose father began training him from the age of nine.

""I represented India at the Culinary Olympics in 2012 and won a bronze for fruit and vegetable carving,"" says Umasankar, who along with Yeshwanth participated in the 2016 event also. ""I again won a bronze in the same category while my son came fourth,"" he says.

Encouraged by his parents, Yeshwanth also gave up regular schooling and did his Class X through NIOS.

""The dates of the Olympics and the board exams would have clashed, so I did it through NIOS and scored 401/ 500,"" says Yeshwanth, who competed with 2,000 chefs from 70 different countries.

""I want to be the world's best chef. People specialise in cooking or baking but I want to be an all-rounder and keep going back to the Culinary Olympics till I win 100 medals,"" he says.

The event, to mark International Women’s Day, has been organised to felicitate Indian sportswomen and is the first such award ceremony hosted by the British broadcaster. While Vempati could not be reached for comment, TOI has learnt that he has communicated his decision to not attend the ceremony in writing and said the BBC’s ground reports were “damningly silent” on “murderous and targeted” assaults on the men in uniform.

The BBC’s reports of Delhi Police’s alleged complicity in the violence against Muslims is what appears to have irked the Indian pubcaster. The Prasar Bharati CEO is learnt to have said that such reports, instead of calming prevailing tensions, had only vitiated the atmosphere further. He also asked the British broadcaster to “respect the sovereignty of nations” and urged it to work together with the Indian broadcaster in greater public interest.

When TOI contacted BBC for comment on Vempati declining the invite, a BBC Spokesperson said, “We were sorry to hear Mr Vempati won’t be coming to the awards ceremony on Sunday as it will be a brilliant chance to showcase the achievements of some talented sportswomen. The BBC is committed to fair and impartial coverage, without fear or favour, and we stand by our journalism in respect of our reporting of recent events in India.”

With 47 deaths and over 300 persons grievously injured, the Delhi riots have rocked the country and disrupted proceedings of Parliament since it resumed on March 2. While opposition parties have blamed ministers and members of the BJP government for fuelling the riots, the government has maintained it has closely reviewed the situation and urged people not to believe in rumours or fall prey to “evil designs of miscreants and groups interested in precipitating communal tension.”

167,['5/03/2020'],India slips in ‘health of democracies’ ranking,"NEW DELHI: A report on the ""health"" of democracies across the world has criticised India for ""discriminatory actions"" against minorities in the world's largest democracy. India’s overall score dropped to 71 in 2020, compared to 75 in 2019. It, however, does not include Kashmir, which is rated separately, and carries a score of only 28 out of 100. Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have scores of 38, 39 and 58 respectively. China is ranked 10.

Titled “A Leaderless Struggle for Democracy,” the report was prepared by Freedom House , a government funded NGO in the US. It mentions several key points, including the abrogation of article 370 and internet shutdown in Kashmir, suppression of protests, controversial citizen register in Assam , threat to freedom of expression and the citizenship amendment act (CAA), as reasons behind “alarming setbacks to Indian democracy.”

The report, which studied 195 nations and 15 territories over the past year, uses 25 indicators, which together carry a total score of 100. The country’s most notable drop has been in terms of civil liberties, which is the largest decline among the 25 most populous democracies.

Indicators used to study a democracy’s health is based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and include electoral processes, political processes and pluralism, functioning of government, freedom of expression and belief, association and organisational rights, rule of law, personal autonomy and individual rights.

Commenting on Kashmir, the report states that “its status declined from ‘Partly Free to Not Free’ due to the Indian government’s abrupt revocation of the region’s autonomy, the postponement or elimination of legislative elections, and a security crackdown that sharply curtailed civil liberties and included mass arrests of local politicians and activists.”

The executive summary of the report states that ""harassment of journalists and other government critics has increased under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), as have religiously motivated attacks against non-Hindus. Certain minority groups — notably Muslims, scheduled castes (Dalits), and scheduled tribes (Adivasis)—remain economically and socially marginalized despite general legal equality and, in some cases, affirmative-action programs.""

The report acknowledges that India “continues to earn a Free rating and held successful elections last spring”, but adds that the BJP has distanced itself from the country’s founding commitments to pluralism and individual rights, without which democracy cannot long survive.”

On the state of media, the report states that “Authorities have used security, defamation, sedition and hate speech laws, as well as contempt of court charges to curb critical voices…” Hindu nationalist campaigns aimed at discouraging forms of expression deemed antinational have exacerbated self-censorship… Online disinformation was widespread in the run-up to the 2019 elections, it states.

169,['5/03/2020'],Government looks at new tools to decriminalise Companies Act,"NEW DELHI: As part of the drive to decriminalise the Companies Act, the government is set to test waters with an “alternative framework” for at least five provisions aimed at making life simpler for businesses and easier to implement.For instance, section 16 of the law allows the government to order a name change in cases where a recently-incorporated company’s name is similar to an existing one. Failure to do so results in a daily fine of Rs 1,000 on the company, with designated executives too facing a fine of Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh. The amendments will do away with the penalty. Instead, they introduce a system under which the government will issue a new computer-generated name if the company refuses to change the name for three months, which is seen as a nudge.Similarly, under the current provisions, penalties are prescribed for non-cooperation of promoters or directors of a company that is being wound up. The Bill has proposed that the issue be dealt with under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Bill, instead of imposing criminal liability for such an offence. A similar approach has been proposed for official liquidators too as the ministry of corporate affairs and a committee appointed by it were of the view that this can be dealt through administrative action.The Bill also proposes to allow Indian companies to list overseas through an enabling amendment, while also seeking to provide flexibility to companies on spending related to corporate social responsibility (CSR). For instance, companies that have to spend less than Rs 50 lakh towards the mandated spend need not set up a committee now. Similarly, companies that spend more than the mandated 2% can now carry forward the additional expenditure to subsequent years and set off their liability.The alternative framework is part of the 72 amendments to the Companies Act cleared by the Union Cabinet on Wednesday, with the government planning to introduce a Bill during the current session of Parliament. The Company Law Committee had been tasked with exploring other mechanisms as well, such as plea bargain, to reduce the load on companies for minor offences but has so far stuck to decriminalise several provisions.FM Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters that a group of ministers, which looked at the law in detail, had decided against reducing the penalties for serious offences such as fraud and the proposed changes are meant to make life simpler for businesses.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74484880,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-796320,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/government-looks-at-new-tools-to-decriminalise-companies-act/articleshow/74484882.cms

MUMBAI/ NEW DELHI: The committee of creditors of Reliance Communications (RCom) has unanimously approved the sale of its assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm and UV Asset Reconstruction Company (UVARC). While Jio had put in a Rs 4,700-crore bid for RCom’s tower & fibre assets, UVARC offered Rs 14,000 crore for the bankrupt telecom operator’s spectrum, real estate, enterprise & data centre businesses.

The resolution professional overseeing the sale of RCom’s assets will be filing the two proposals before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Thursday to seek the quasi-judiciary body’s approval.

While Jio has proposed an upfront payment of Rs 3,600 crore, UVARC has proposed an upfront cash payment of Rs 15 crore. The asset reconstruction company will make the remainder payments in future after it monetises RCom’s properties.

The 100% approval by RCom’s committee of creditors is a major milestone as earlier the process had got delayed since lenders failed to come to an agreement. The lenders will have to wait for some more time to recover their dues as the transactions, specifically the sale of spectrum, requires the telecom regulator’s approval.

Although RCom has lost most of its customers, UVARC feels that it can recover a substantial amount by selling spectrum in 14 of India’s 22 telecom circles. Resolution professional had identified Rs 31,788-crore claims from financial creditors of RCom and Rs 22,455 crore from DoT. With SC directing telecom players to pay AGR dues to government, owner of RCom’s spectrum will have to clear the outstanding payments.

Asking the managers to stay calm, state IT & industries principal secretary Jayesh Ranjan announced that Cyberabad police commissioner V C Sajjanar would be the nodal officer for industry players to contact before taking any step.The announcement was made at a press meet attended by Ranjan, Sajjanar, director of public health G Srinivas Rao and representatives of IT companies and Raheja Mindspace IT Park. On Wednesday morning, some companies working out of Building 20 at Raheja Mindspace suspended operations and directed employees to work from home after a female employee of one of the companies was suspected to have contracted the virus. The employee, had returned from Italy.“Since some of those at the workplace were exposed to her, sanitation work was taken up by Raheja Mindspace authorities on Wednesday. From Thursday, companies can work without issues,’’ Ranjan said.Raheja Mindspace CEO G Shravan said nine companies work out of Building 20. “Except four companies, the rest conducted operations on Wednesday without any hassle. The building houses 7,500 employees working in different companies,” he said. Sajjanar said authorities are keeping an eye on the rumours floating on social media and would crackdown on rumour mongers.While some companies with offices in the vicinity of Building No. 20 asked employees to work from home and also cautioned them to avoid use of elevators, for many other companies it was business as usual.In fact, many IT employees trooping into work complained about shortage of masks, some others said they have been provided masks and hand sanitisers at their offices. The day also saw companies circulating mails to keep employees informed about the Do’s and Don’ts and to prevent any panic.In a communication to employees, US-based Pegasystems, which also has a facility in Mindspace, said that due to the changing nature of the situation and differing levels of maturity of the virus in each region, it’s very difficult to issue blanket statements on policy on particular issues and encouraged its offices to act locally and/or regionally based on specific circumstances.IT industry representatives said they have suggested to companies to temporarily discontinue the use of biometric attendance systems and instead encourage use of ID cards. Many IT companies, especially MNCs, said they have already been following global advisories on Covid-19 and have been encouraging people to work from home in case they are unwell.“We are providing real-time guidance to employees in all affected regions. We will continue to monitor the situation and take action as necessary to help protect employees,” said a Microsoft spokesperson.A TCS spokesperson said the company is working closely with all relevant local, regional and global, health institutions and are implementing the latest recommendations.Even IT body Hysea said it is working with Telangana government and has issued an advisory to member companies on how to handle cases of employees returning from abroad. “This is a broad advisory... It is up to individual companies to further take specific steps... in line with their policy and specific situation on the ground,” said a Hysea spokesperson.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74484923,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-605035,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dont-suspend-work-over-covid-19-telangana-govt-tells-it-firms/articleshow/74484905.cms
172,['5/03/2020'],Flipkart faces probe for misuse of market dominance,"BENGALURU: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has directed the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to start investigating e-commerce firm Flipkart for alleged misuse of its dominant position in the market. The order is based on an appeal for a probe filed in 2018 by the All India Online Vendors’ Association (AIOVA), which represents a group of small e-sellers.The competition regulator had earlier disposed of AIOVA’s appeal for a probe into Flipkart, which is owned by US retail major Walmart. But NCLAT set aside the CCI order and asked the director general to begin an investigation.The move comes at a time when CCI had begun a probe into Amazon India and Flipkart. The probe was launched in January this year based on a complaint by the Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh. But the Karnataka high court gave both Amazon and Flipkart a stay on CCI’s investigation last month after the two e-tailers, who control 70-80% of the market, filed an appeal.“We are delighted with today’s order. We are positive after the e-commerce study findings that the CCI will penalise these platforms for violating various provisions of the Competition Act,” said Chanakya Basa, who represented AIOVA in this case.“We understand that the NCLAT has issued an order in relation to the AIOVA appeal. We are currently awaiting a copy of the order,” a Flipkart spokesperson said. The allegations made against Flipkart include the sale of goods on a wholesale basis to select sellers, who in turn sell on Flipkart marketplace, and preferential treatment of small sellers. AIOVA made these allegations against two Flipkart entities — Flipkart India (the wholesale arm) and Flipkart Internet (the marketplace entity).For CCI, while it initially did not find merit in AIOVA’s plea, the regulator recently conducted a study on the e-commerce sector which was followed by the launch of the probe earlier this year. Interestingly, Amazon India, prior to the latest developments, had referred to the CCI’s 2018 order disposing of the AIOVA plea several times in the Karnataka high court, when it argued for a stay order on the CCI probe on Amazon and Flipkart. But the HC stayed that CCI probe last month.The complaints against both Flipkart and Amazon have been in the making for a while as small traders have been pleading the government over various practices in the last 18 months.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74490091,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-307297,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/flipkart-faces-probe-for-misuse-of-market-dominance/articleshow/74484898.cms

NEW DELHI: Recent surveys conducted by the income tax department have revealed that real estate developer Parsvnath allegedly failed to deposit over Rs 200-crore tax it had deducted with the government, while authorities have also raised questions over amounts deposited by public sector companies Indian Oil and BSNL .

Sources said Parsvnath’s alleged failure to deposit the amount and interest came to light during surveys conducted by tax authorities earlier this week. The realtor did not respond to a query sent by TOI on Tuesday.

For Indian Oil, the liability was estimated at Rs 3,200 crore, the finance ministry said, without naming the PSU. There was a short deduction of tax by the oil major pertaining to TDS for several years on payment of “fee for technical services for installation and maintenance of hi-tech oil refineries, payments for chemical process of re-gasification and transportation of LNG”, the department said.

In case of BSNL, which recently received a government bailout, the surveys have accused the company of deducting 2% tax instead of 10%, the applicable rate for professional services. In a statement, the tax department said the default by “a major telecom company operator” was estimated at Rs 324 crore.

Surveys were also undertaken on two leading hospitals, with one of them found to be not deducting tax on construction contracts, while the second one was undertaking 10% TDS on “salary paid to doctors” instead of the mandated 30%, CBDT said. All put together, the liability added up to Rs 3,800 crore, including those of the two PSUs and Parsvnath.

175,['5/03/2020'],Nod for government bank mergers from April,"(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: Ending the speculation over delay in the merger of public sector banks, the Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the amalgamation of 10 state-run banks to create four large entities from April 1.

“Sticking to the April 1, 2020 deadline, banks are fully on board. The Cabinet may have given the decision today, they were on course and doing everything that requires to be done so that this (amalgamation) will be effective from April 1,” finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said after the Cabinet meeting.

While the merger had been announced in August, the scheme had to be approved by the Cabinet and bankers fear that the government took time in endorsing the decision as several regulatory requirements have to be completed over the next four weeks.

The banks have been coordinating to work out the post-merger operational details. But before that, the swap ratio and other regulatory approvals from the RBI and Sebi need to be in place.

Sitharaman said the government has looked into the impact of Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank’s merger with Bank of Baroda and concluded that the exercise had a positive impact. She said the operating profit of the resulting lender has improved and retail loans are now sanctioned in 11 days (on average) from 23 days earlier.

According to the merger plan, Punjab National Bank will take over Oriental Bank of Commerce and United Bank of India, while Syndicate Bank will merge into Canara Bank . Similarly, Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank will merge into Union Bank of India , and Allahabad Bank into Indian Bank. Government believes that the exercise will create seven large public sector entities with scale and national reach, with each amalgamated entity having business of over Rs 8 lakh crore.

NEW DELHI: Holding that RBI plays a special role in economy of the country, SC on Wednesday said it is not just like any other statutory body and its decisions cannot be put on lower pedestal in comparison to the government’s decisions.

Examining various provisions of the RBI Act and Banking Regulation Act, a bench of Justices R F Nariman, Aniruddha Bose and V Ramasubramanian said, “The RBI is not just like any other statutory body created by an Act of legislature. It is a creature, created with a mandate to get liberated even from its creator.”

The court’s remarks came as it quashed RBI’s circular preventing banking and financial institutions from providing services to entities dealing in virtual currency ( cryptocurrency ).

The court said the has wide powers to operate the currency and credit system of the country and operate the monetary policy framework in the country and also to take over the management of the currency from the central government. It said the regulator has the sole right to issue bank notes in India and to get rupees into circulation only through it, to the exclusion of the central government besides managing public debt.

“Therefore, the RBI cannot be equated to any other statutory body that merely serves its master. It is specifically empowered to do certain things to the exclusion of even the central government. Therefore, to place its decisions at a pedestal lower than that of even an executive decision, would do violence to the scheme of the Act,” the bench said. The court rejected the plea that the decision of the RBI is not entitled to the deference or reverence like the legislative decision or executive decision.

179,['5/03/2020'],Don’t see how rate cut would cure you of virus: Blackstone chief,"MUMBAI: Blackstone co-founder & chairman Stephen Schwarzman says that investors need to bracket the economic risks from coronavirus and brace for disruption for a year, accepting that there will be a decline in value of investments. But, he added, investors can bear in mind that the current situation also presents opportunities for people with capital.Blackstone is the world’s largest alternative asset manager — a term used to describe firms which invest in real estate and private shares as against conventional assets. In India, it has invested close to $16 billion in private equity, real estate and stressed assets with the last $6 billion coming in the previous 12 months. The firm has survived several crashes despite being in a high-risk business.Responding to the latest decision of the US Federal Reserve, Schwarzman, 73, said, “I should not be this provocative, but I don’t understand how interest rate cuts basically cure you of the coronavirus.”Schwarzman said that while the Indian economy has slowed down, inflation is higher and there is less confidence in the business establishment. Blackstone views this as things that can be improved. “We have enormous flexibility in moving money to India because we think, for long term, India is very positive.”Schwarzman, who has written about his learnings in setting up Blackstone in his book ‘What it takes — Lessons in the pursuit of excellence’, has highlighted how the ability to identify business cycles has enabled the firm to avoid losing money. For instance, in 2006, a comment by head of India real estate business Tuhin Parekh, that land prices have gone up 10 times, compelled Schwarzman to call off a Spanish housing deal ahead of the global crisis.Later, at a fireside chat with Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay, Schwarzman said that the Indian banking system is facing issues because of which credit is constrained.“You need to have very healthy financial institutions because economic growth is really co-related with credit extension. And if your financial institutions aren’t in great shape, then they can’t lend as much, people can’t borrow as much, they can’t spend money they don’t have and economies just slow down,” he said.To deal with defaults, he said banks need to “charge off those losses” and attract capital to allow the institutions to make new loans that are better so the institution makes more money and things work.To a question from Smita Parekh, wife of HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh, about what keeps him awake at night, Schwarzman said geopolitical risks and internal politics that are “uncontrollable” are matters that make him uncomfortable.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74490553,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-129072,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/dont-see-how-rate-cut-would-cure-you-of-virus-blackstone-chief/articleshow/74484951.cms

Transitions are a part of every career. You can trigger a transition when you change your employer or even the sector. Sometimes, the scenario changes for reasons beyond control. The change of a reporting relationship or even a promotion may require you to plan for the transition. When the change is not triggered by you, it is natural to feel anxious.I believe that a transition is like a trapeze act — when a performer releases the bar and is caught by another person, the ‘catcher’, who hangs by his or her knees on another trapeze. After the first performer leaves the trapeze bar and is held by the colleague, for a brief period, the performer is in midair without any support. Transitions are like that ‘in-between moment’. They are scary, but manageable.Your last performance rating was good. That matters a lot. The new manager has not had a chance to evaluate your performance. Your boss would be hard-pressed to explain why the performance of an employee who has done well in the past drops because the manager has changed. That would reflect poorly on the new manager’s skills and capability. Your new manager would be equally keen to see you doing well.The green-eyed monster called jealousy — the real issue seems to be something else. I sense some frustration at having to report to an erstwhile colleague. It is but natural. You may have experienced a similar scenario when you have had to manage someone who was once your peer. The organisation is shaped like a pyramid. People’s careers move at different paces. While driving, two lanes sometimes merge into one. Vehicles have to take turns to form a single file. If two drivers try to get into the single lane simultaneously, it would end badly for both.We accept not getting the same marks as our classmates in school or college. But at work, we expect that we will always be chosen ahead of our peers. Your career will not be judged by the progress that a colleague makes. Your skills and competencies will create opportunities for you and no one can take that away. I am sure your colleagues are watching how you are handling the relationship with your colleague. Handling it with grace will make you stand tall in the eyes of others. Don’t walk away from this opportunity to learn a vital life lesson.Walk up to your new manager and congratulate him or her. Then state that you did experience disappointment at not being chosen instead. But you are committed to building a strong team where both of you succeed. Your colleague will be pleasantly surprised and will go the extra mile to respond to your graciousness.Who knows, one day you will get a promotion ahead of your peers. When you notice someone feeling disappointed and disengaged, you know just what to do. Have a candid conversation. Acknowledge the disappointment and address it together. This will be one of the most powerful relationships you can build..",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74484976,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-816540,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/adwise-workplace-counselling-my-peer-became-my-boss-and-rated-me-poorly-i-am-stuck/articleshow/74484968.cms

184,['5/03/2020'],"Supreme Court order: Relief for Bitcoin firms, investors","BENGALURU: The Supreme Court’s decision to lift the ban on cryptocurrencies has come as a welcome relief to entrepreneurs and investors in bitcoin exchanges even though the ruling comes two years after the RBI banned banks from dealing with bitcoins in April 2018. The cryptocurrency ban dealt a crippling blow to the industry and saw the closure of more than a dozen exchanges in India including Coinome, Zebpay, Koinex, Cryptokart.“I feel vindicated by the SC verdict. We were all along saying this is an overreach. Now, hopefully things should improve and we should be able to restart,” said Sathvik Vishwanath , founder of crypto exchange Unocoin, who was arrested by Karnataka police given the legal uncertainty in the space.Unocoin’s business had fallen 20% immediately after the ban. And there was a lull, following the global slowdown in demand.But other entrepreneurs and VCs said the road ahead might prove difficult. For one thing, the government’s attitude towards cryptocurrency remains suspicious and wary.“Last year, the government’s panel recommended a jail term of up to 10 years and heavy fines for those dealing with digital currencies. Whenever we have met ministry officials to represent our case — we found ourselves being stonewalled. So given that, despite the SC verdict, the government’s lack of enthusiasm might keep both investors and banks away,” said the founder of a bitcoin exchange that has shut shop.And RBI’s distrust could keep banks away from supporting bitcoin exchanges. “Currently, there was a freeze even in ancillary activities as there was a fear as to no matter what you do, you could fall within the ambit of the circular. The banks were being overly cautious. It should now clear up a bit. Banks are still at their discretion on whether to enable crypto businesses or not. Even outside of the RBI circular being quashed, there is a risk that banks will not suddenly change their tack. That is a challenge we have to deal with and that’s something the industry has to deal with globally,” said Anirudh Rastogi , founder of Ikigai Law, the firm that represented the crypto exchanges in the Supreme Court.According to Rastogi, the SC judgment has largely taken the stance that the measures taken by the RBI were not proportionate. The RBI could have adopted other measures which are not as extreme (leading exchanges to shut operations). Another legal expert, who did not wish to be named, said the government’s draft law on virtual currency would not be of much use in light for the SC ruling. One bitcoin is currently worth Rs 6.4 lakh.A VC, who invested $2.5 million in a bitcoin exchange, said, “While the SC verdict is a positive. It is still early stages. Most investors would prefer to wait and watch — rather than bet again on bitcoins. Once bitten, twice shy.”",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74487328,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-50849,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sc-order-relief-for-bitcoin-firms-investors/articleshow/74484996.cms

HYDERABAD: Two days after Malkajgiri MP Revanth Reddy and other Congress workers released aerial photographs of a farmhouse belonging to Telangana IT minister K Taraka Rama Rao's family, Narsingi police on Wednesday arrested six persons for using drones without permission and declared Revanth and his brother Krishna Reddy as accused.

Cyberabad police, in a press release issued on Wednesday, said they arrested the six persons - Praveen Paul Reddy, Vijay Simha Reddy, Jaipal Reddy, Rajesh, Shiva and Om Prakash Reddy - for using drones, in violation of government orders, to photograph a private property.

Police said the accused took the photographs using drone on the instructions of A Krishna Reddy, brother of Revanth Reddy.

""Krishna Reddy had instructed Vijaya Paul Reddy to entrust his brother Praveen Paul Reddy to come to Jubilee Hills. Praveen Paul Reddy, his friend Vijay Simha Reddy went to the office of Revanth Reddy near Peddamma temple. There, Krishna Reddy met them and instructed them to meet one Jaipal Reddy to shoot and capture images of areas in Miyakhangadda and its surroundings,"" the Cyberabad police said. Later, Praveen Paul Reddy and a few others landed at the office of Jaipal Reddy at Kokapet with a drone.

""Jaipal Reddy had also arranged one Om Prakash Reddy to accompany him to shoot the target area. They reached a nearby cricket ground and tested the drone there. Then, they reached another location from where they succeeded in capturing images of the targeted premises and its surroundings with an intention to violate the privacy of individuals and cause harm,'' the release added.

AHMEDABAD: Nearly six years after he left his pet dog unleashed putting his neighbours vulnerable to canine attack, Bhadresh Pandya (49) is paying the price. In fact, the pet owner finds himself on a short leash with the city sessions court restricting his movement as a bail condition.

In January, Pandya was handed down one-year imprisonment by a metropolitan court for his pet's attacks on his neighbours. After he was punished, he challenged his conviction and applied for bail.

In a recent order, additional sessions judge R S Purani granted bail to Pandya on furnishing Rs 10,000 bond. However, the court placed a condition on Pandya for his freedom - he cannot travel beyond Gujarat limits. He would require prior permission from the court to travel outside the state. ""The applicant shall not leave the local limits of Gujarat without prior permission of this court,"" the court order reads.

A resident of Ashapuri Society in Ghodasar , Pandya was booked by Isanpur police in 2014 under sections 289, 337 and 338 of the IPC after his dog 'Shakti' seriously hurt people and created panic in the neighbourhood.

The FIR was lodged after the canine attacked three children and an adult, Avinash Patel. The complainant had said that he had fallen down due to dog's attack and suffered multiple fractures. Before that, the dog had bit Patel's son Jay, his nephew Takshil and one more kid named Vyom Kayasth.

Pandya had pleaded 'not guilty' and faced the trial, finally to be convicted six years later. He urged the magisterial court to be lenient and grant him benefit of probation, but the court wanted to set an example and rejected his request for probation. Pandya has now questioned the verdict in the sessions court. His advocate D K Jain said that one of the grounds is that the FIR was lodged at a belated stage in this case.

BENGALURU: Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Wednesday admitted in the legislative assembly that corruption was deep-rooted in government offices and held transfer racket as the root cause of the graft menace.

“Unless we root it out from the system, we can never uphold the spirit of the Constitution and ensure equitable justice to people. If legislators lend support (to this cause), then we can weed out this menace,” Yediyurappa said during a special discussion on the Constitution.

Successive governments have been accused by opposition parties of running a transfer racket, but there’s very little done to institute a probe or order a crackdown following the allegations.

The chief minister’s candid admission came after senior Congress MLA HK Patil , quoting a report from Amnesty International, said 63% of people in Karnataka give bribe to get their work done in government offices. The CM said he agreed with the report in toto.

AHMEDABAD: The city's 131-year-old heritage icon, Ellisbridge , will not be history - the AMC has been told that the bridge need not be pulled down.

In a detailed report to the AMC, the consultant - overseeing the conservation of the famed bowstring arch truss bridge - has recommended measures to save it. One of them is applying reinforced steel-alloy patches to the bottom of the bridge's piers (pillars) to strengthen the structure.

Over the past two months, the pin-jointed truss structures of Ellisbridge, the main skeleton, were being individually analyzed for strength, compression, bending and weight distribution. “The consultant had also conducted metallurgical tests on the piers to determine whether replacements were required,” said a senior AMC official. “Large pieces of steel-alloy parts along with an alternative material will be used to repair the bridge.”

Ellisbridge will be transformed into a pedestrian bridge, which may double up as an art gallery, said civic officials. “In fact, a section of the old carriageway will replaced with glass so that the river is clearly visible,” an official said.

“The consultant’s report was encouraging. We will be able to fully restore the bridge with a f ew major repairs,” municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra said. “We will also take third-party opinion on the consultant’s report to be doubly sure.” Nehra went on to say: “Since the bridge rests on a monopile structure, adequate care has to be taken.” The plan for the bridge was discussed at an hourlong meeting involving the AMC and the consultant, on Wednesday.

An AMC official added that two new approaches to Ellisbridge will be designed so that pedestrians do not find it difficult to cross.

190,['5/03/2020'],Karnataka high court orders relook into Metro plea to cut trees,"Representative image

BENGALURU: The high court on Wednesday directed a special committee to conduct a fresh examination of all applications submitted by Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) for felling of trees.

A series of applications seeking permission for cutting or translocation of more than 200 trees along the alignment of the ongoing Namma Metro project were recently approved by tree officers and other authorities concerned.

The government had constituted the special committee after a direction from the high court in April last year. The panel comprises experts from the field of environment, science, technology and others. The panel was mandated to examine whether trees proposed to be felled could be saved and permit cutting only after exhausting all options to save them.

On Wednesday, a division bench of chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka noted the main objective of Karnataka Preservation of Trees Act, 1976 is to save as many trees as possible and the same is not forthcoming in the orders permitting felling of trees on applications submitted by BMRCL.

The bench noted in none of the orders, the authorities have evaluated the need for felling the trees in question and the committee must look into the aspect as to whether a particular tree comes within the alignment or not and if it can be saved or translocated.

4,859 trees counted so far

In a related development, BBMP informed the court that the tree census has started and 4,859 trees have been counted so far. The court then posted the matter to April17 to await the progress in the tree census and the re-examination of applications submitted by BMRCL. The court is hearing a PIL filed by Bangalore Environment Trust and Dattatraya T Devare, an environmentalist, who have said the state government, Bangalore Urban District Tree Authority and the BBMP have failed to save trees.

Guest speakers and teachers from affected countries are also being prevented from attending CU-organised seminars and events with immediate effect. ""We will not issue NOCs for travel to the affected countries,"" said a senior CU official.A senior CU official said: “Foreign students studying at the university have been requested to stop travelling out of the country at the moment, preferably not even to their home countries.”A CU source said that China, the UK, Japan, Italy and France are among the most popular destinations among CU scholars for academic reasons. All of these countries have been affected. Registrar Debasis Das added around 7 students from the “worst-hit” countries have been asked to refrain from visiting hostels. “We have also requested foreign students to wear masks,” he added. Also, other students have been asked to exert caution while visiting hostels where students from affected countries are boarders.A CU science teacher said the step, while needed, will cause delays in collaborative projects with popular universities outside India, many of which are in China and Japan.Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) is likely to issue a notice on Friday for foreign students, faculty and guest lecturers from abroad, as well as for those who are scheduled to visit virus-affected countries. “We are likely to ask those who intend to travel abroad to examine how urgent it is for them to visit the affected countries,” said vice-chancellor Sabyasachi Basu Roychoudhuri. “We are not in a position to prohibit any movement. We can only alert students and faculty members and leave the decision to them.”At the moment, the university has no plans to invite guests from China or other South-East Asian countries, as also from European countries from where the outbreak has been reported. “We have advised foreign students that they should, if possible, refrain from returning to their countries, if outbreaks have been reported from there, or even travel abroad,” added the VC.RBU has quite a high concentration of foreign students on campus. “The foreign students mostly stay on their own.

BENGALURU: A 25-year-old man holding a bag and standing under Hebbal flyover aroused suspicion in beat policemen on an early morning last week. They questioned the youth and were startled to find 45 mobile phones in the bag.

Imran Iliyas Khan of Azadnagar in Chamarajpet was taken to Kodigehalli police station and soon, he confessed that he and his associate, Nayaz from Guddadahalli , stole mobiles of passengers on BMTC buses. The duo then disposed of the gadgets in Hyderabad, Mumbai and Chennai to prevent them from being tracked in Karnataka .

Imran was a pickpocket and soon graduating into stealing mobiles. He is suspected to have stolen more than 1,000 phones over five years, besides making away with laptops from open windows of houses, police said.

Police recovered 109 handsets worth around Rs 9 lakh from Imran and launched a manhunt for Nayaz. The phones were stolen over six months. According to Imran, he earned anywhere between Rs 1,000 and Rs 10,000 for each handset.

“Imran and Nayaz would travel to Majestic, buy oneday passes and board crowded bus to places like Jayanagar, Banashankari and Koramangala . They would look for passengers travelling solo and carrying mobiles in their trouser pockets. Standing on either side of the passenger, they would press his shoulder to divert his attention. Then, they would steal the phone and flee,” police said quoting from Imran’s confession.

They would switch off the device soon after pocketing it and get down from the bus at the next stop. Police are yet to find out how many phones the duo had stolen.

KOCHI: More than 75% of Kochiites with bookings for a holiday abroad with family have cancelled their travel plans in the wake of the Covid-19 cases. There are nearly 18,000 to 20,000 advance bookings from Ernakulam district alone.

Of the total travel by Kochiites abroad, more than 50% is for leisure during April and May. The most popular destinations are East Asian countries, Dubai and Europe.

""We are witnessing large-scale cancellation of group tours. However, some are still willing to travel to places where Covid-19 cases have not been detected. On Thursday, a group of 50 persons will leave for Dubai,"" said Praveen Shetty of New Prime India Cochin Tours and Travels.

Malayalis mostly opt for advance bookings for summer vacations and plan their trip by December or January. They stand to lose money as airlines and hotels are refusing full refunds. ""The only exception is China,"" said Shetty.

Incidentally, the most affected would be those who had planned their trips on their own. They stand to lose everything they paid for hotels as well as airfare. Those opting for group tours with a travel agency may lose only about 50% to 60% of advance paid, if airlines refuse to reimburse in full.

Travel agents must bear the brunt as they have made advance payments for blocking airline seats and hotel rooms. They block about 20 to 30 seats in airlines to popular destinations for the summer months.

With most airlines refusing to reimburse money for cancellations, tour operators have sought the assistance of Union tourism ministry. ""Airlines claim that since they operate flights to most destinations, they are not legally bound to reimburse for cancellations,"" said Rashmi Murali, managing partner, Yatri Travels.

NEW DELHI: The novel coronavirus scare in India took a serious turn on Wednesday, with the health ministry confirming as many as 23 new cases — all in Delhi, Agra and Jaipur — taking the total number of people who have so far been infected to 29.A 26-year-old Paytm employee, a resident of Pankha Road in Janakpuri, became the second Delhi resident to contract Covid-19. He had recently returned from a vacation in Italy, a coronavirus hotspot.A majority of the new cases were among a party of Italian tourists, with 15 more testing positive for the virus, including the wife of the 69-year-old man, currently being treated in Jaipur, who had possibly carried the infection from Italy.Others included six relatives from Agra of the Delhi resident who had earlier tested positive for the infection.The Paytm employee worked at the company’s Gurgaon office, which has been shut for 15 days. The company’s employees in Noida and other offices across India have been advised to work from home for the next two days. Paytm has also advised all team members who were in contact with the patient to get tested. The firm has nearly 3,000 employees, and the majority work out of its offices in Noida and Gurgaon.Health officials in Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan – where the Covid-19 patients have been travelling – face a massive task of tracing and testing everyone who may have come in contact with the infected people. The number of such persons is estimated to be over 100.“The Italian nationals who tested positive for Covid-19 had been travelling across Rajasthan, Agra in Uttar Pradesh and parts of Delhi, before being put under isolation. The Delhi resident, too, came in contact with more than 60 individuals including his family members from the time he returned from Italy – where he is suspected to have caught the infection – to the time when he was finally tested positive for the novel coronavirus infection,” said a source.Meanwhile, Paytm announced a slew of precautions after one of its employees tested positive.A company spokesperson said, “One of our colleagues who recently returned from Italy has sadly been tested positive for coronavirus. He is receiving treatment (at Safdarjung hospital) and we are extending complete support to his family. As a precautionary measure, we have suggested his team members to get health tests done immediately. We have also advised all our colleagues to work from home for a couple of days while we get our offices sanitised. However, there will not be any impact on our daily operations and Paytm services will continue as usual.""Government sources said all persons found positive for Covid19, except the 69-year-old Italian who was first in his group to be detected with Covid-19 and who is under treatment at Sawai Manshingh (SMS) hospital in Jaipur, are stable.“The 69-year-old has some difficulty breathing. He is being given respiratory support using bi-pap machine, in addition to being treated with various antibiotics and anti-viral drugs for symptomatic relief,” said a source.His wife, who tested positive on Wednesday, is also being treated at the same hospital.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said while there is no need to panic, government has asked all states, including Delhi-NCR where the maximum positive cases of Covid-19 are being treated at present, to create more isolation facilities.“I met Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain today and we discussed in detail preparedness for management of Covid-19 in Delhi. We have asked the state authorities to develop isolation facilities in all hospitals where the positive and suspected cases can be quarantined, if the need arises,” Vardhan said.Later, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal also announced the creation of a state task force to tackle the outbreak, if any, and to check black-marketing of masks and sanitisers.Covid-19 spreads very fast and it is known to cause severe symptoms in elderly and those with pre-existing illnesses. Experience from China, where the outbreak originated, shows that children and young people are least affected by it.A top official in Niti Aayog said the government is planning to involve private hospitals as well in the coming days to scale up infrastructure for isolating and treating positive cases.“A meeting of representatives from top private hospitals has been called on Thursday to discuss the plan. The government will help them create such facility,” V K Paul, member, Niti Aayog, told TOI.Till date, 94,348 cases and 3,221 deaths have been reported due to Covid-19 – a novel coronavirus infection that was first reported in Wuhan in China.Epidemiologists said there was no need to panic as latest reports from China show the outbreak has started waning in China. “With right measures and awareness, Covid-19 outbreak can be controlled,” said a doctor. He added that most Covid-19 cases are mild. “Mortality rate is around 3%, which is lesser than that of SARS and MERS, both coronaviruses that caused outbreaks in the past,” the doctor added.However, the on ground, anxiety levels are clearly on the rise.

LUCKNOW: Four city policemen who on Wednesday decided to ride a seized SUV to Lakhimpur Kheri , where they were required to record the statement of a murder accused, left the entire department embarrassed after the vehicle’s owner remotely locked it and the news of the trapped cops went viral on social media.

In a quick face-saver, Lucknow police commissioner Sujeet Pandey removed SHO PK Singh of Gomtinagar, where the SUV was seized and brought on Tuesday afternoon, and sent him to police lines after a preliminary inquiry.

Sources said that SHO Singh had not stopped his juniors, investigating last month’s Alaknanda Apartment stabbing case in Gomtinagar extension, from taking the SUV to Lakhimpur Kheri to record the statement of key murder accused Arpan Shukla .

“The SHO has been removed for laxity. It is yet to be established if he granted permission to the policemen to use a seized vehicle. Nevertheless, as in-charge, he is responsible for all seized items brought to the police station,” Pandey said.

The SUV belongs to Akhand Singh , a native of Gonda who now lives in the city’s Gosainganj. Akhand was reportedly caught in a financial dispute on Tuesday between his friend and another youth who had taken a loan from the friend to buy a car. Since the youth had defaulted on loan instalment, Akhand’s friend had taken possession of the car. The disgruntled youth lodged a loot case against Akhand and his friend, and also gave police the registration number of Akhand’s SUV.

A police team intercepted Akhand and seized his SUV in Gomtinagar on Tuesday. He was asked to collect his vehicle on Wednesday. However, when Akhand checked on his GPS-enabled SUV using his smartphone on Wednesday, he found it on the move and remotely turned off the ignition, leaving the cops locked inside, around 143km away in Lakhimpur Kheri. Akhand turned on the ignition following earnest requests from SHO Singh, but on the condition that he would release the central lock only after his SUV returned to Lucknow.

200,['5/03/2020'],Excavation to rediscover Tamilakam stopped,"Representative image

KOCHI: An initiative to garner insights on ancient Tamilakam under a trust led by P J Cherian, a former director of the Kerala Council for Historical Research (KCHR), has run into rough weather with KCHR objecting to archeological excavation in the property owned by them at Pattanam in Muziris.

Volunteers of PAMA Institute for the Advancement of Trans-disciplinary Archaeological Sciences, which had been granted license by the Archeological Survey of India (ASI), were engaged in preparatory works at Othin Kaadu prior to excavation on February 28 when police asked them to stop the work, following a complaint by the KCHR.

R V G Menon, chairman, PAMA, said they had given a letter to the KCHR director intimating their intention to excavate the plots in December 2019. The excavations were expected to begin on March 1. The PAMA's contention is that as per the Kerala Ancient Monuments and Archeological Sites and Remains Act, 1968, a licence holder from ASI can enter and make excavations in any protected area after giving notice in writing to the director and owner.

""But KCHR says its reading of the law is different from what we have inferred. That we are a private agency and there is no precedence may also be one of the reasons behind the objection,"" Menon said.

In its letter to KCHR, PAMA Institute had expressed its intention to undertake excavations in three plots -Othin Kaadu, a plot adjacent to ayurveda hospital and another site north of Kudumbi Temple in Pattanam.

P K Michael Tharakan , historian and chairperson of KCHR said while KCHR has no objection to an archaeological excavation in the site, there are some apprehensions regarding PAMA being a private trust.

""No one has objection to excavation work being undertaken there. Only thing is that they should acquire land ownership from the government and then intimate us. Then can only we can give permission. If it is a government agency we would not have a problem,"" said Tharakan.

P Sanal Mohan, director KCHR, said they had placed the letter given by PAMA before KCHR executive council. ""The executive said it should be cleared by archeological advisory committee. The committee set some conditions and said it should be referred to government and if they are okay with it PAMA can be allowed to undertake excavation,"" he said.

Cheriyan, director of PAMA said Pattanam, Mathilakam excavations are significant because it would help us understand the cultural foundations of pre-modern humanity when 30-odd cultures came to south-western coast of Kerala and interacted with us. ""This is for the larger good of the society and understanding our cultural foundations. If academicians fail to understand this, it is sad,"" he said.

KOLKATA: A Lakshmipat Singhania Academy student on an 11-month exchange programme to Japan will return to Kolkata next week, much ahead of his scheduled date in April-end. At The Newtown School, 14 classes IX and XI students who are supposed to visit France are now in a dilemma as the parents have requested the school authorities to defer the programme. South City International School, which is scheduled to take 15 students to Dubai to participate in a competition in May, is reconsidering the dSccecision.Struck by the coronavirus scare , several prominent city schools have started postponing foreign trips. The Covid-19 outbreak has also prompted numerous schools hosting foreign students to take strong precautionary measures to stop the spread of the virus.Lakshmipat Singhania Academy principal Meena Kak pointed out that the school has a student exchange programme with Italy and the US and mostly, excursions are organized during Puja holidays and in December. But it has been deferred this time. “We had also sent a student of an 11-month exchange programme to Japan. He was scheduled to return in April. However, he will be in Kolkata next week. His parents are concerned,” said Kak.Birla High School is also taking measures to keep coronavirus at bay. Mukta Nain, the director of the school group, pointed out that the educational trip to France and the US during the summer holidays has been postponed for the time being. “The decision has been taken in the last week after consultation with various authorities,” said the principal. Twelve students were selected from classes X and XI and they were to be accompanied by two teachers for the trip.Calcutta International School has asked all parents and guardians, who have visited any of the affected countries or Southeast Asian nations, seeking admission for their children to the school to complete all the necessary formalities over the phone, including holding interviews.The principal of Birla Bharati School, Apala Dutta, has been planning an excursion next year at the moment. There has already been a study tour to Seoul, South Korea. “We have no immediate plans for a foreign trip,” she said.Students of South City International School have been asked to wear masks. “Those suffering from cold and running nose have been advised to stay home or wear masks while attending classes. The Dubai trip for selected candidates from classes IX to XII is also in jeopardy following concerns of parents. We are reconsidering our decision to allow them to attend the International Model United Nation competition,” said principal John Bagul.Seema Sapru, the principal of the Heritage School, has shown some optimism in conducting the foreign excursion to Germany in July and the UK in October and November. There are a few students in the academy from Korea and Thailand, who have been living in India under guardianship. But they have reportedly not shown any signs of illness so far.“The 10-day exchange programme with a school at Poitiers in France is at risk.

202,['5/03/2020'],California declares emergency over coronavirus as death toll rises in US,"'Distancing measures'

Emergency funds

LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK: The US death toll from coronavirus infections rose to 11 on Wednesday as new cases emerged around New York City and Los Angeles, while Seattle-area health officials sought to allay anxiety and discourage social gatherings amid the nation's largest outbreak.The first California death from the virus was an elderly person in Placer County, near Sacramento, health officials said. The person had underlying health problems and likely had been exposed on a cruise ship voyage between San Francisco and Mexico last month.It was the first coronavirus fatality in the United States outside of Washington state, where 10 people have died in a cluster of at least 39 infections that have emerged through community transmission of the virus in two Seattle-area counties.Although the Placer County patient who died was not believed to have contracted the virus locally, that case and a previous one from the San Francisco Bay Area linked to the same ocean liner have led health authorities to seek other cruise passengers who may have had close contact with those two individuals.Hours after the person's death was announced, California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a statewide emergency in response to the coronavirus, which he said has resulted in 53 cases across the nation's most populous state.""The State of California is deploying every level of government to help identify cases and slow the spread of this coronavirus,"" Newsom said in a statement.Six new coronavirus patients were confirmed in Los Angeles County, public health officials said on Wednesday. One was a federal contractor who may have been exposed while conducting medical screenings at Los Angeles International Airport, the US Department of Homeland Security reported.Three others likely were infected while traveling recently to northern Italy, one of the areas hardest hit in the global outbreak. Of the six in Los Angeles County, only one has been hospitalized. The other five are recovering in home isolation.The greater Seattle region represents the biggest concentration of cases detected in the United States from a virus that has killed more than 3,000 people worldwide, mostly in China, where the epidemic originated in December.With most of the Seattle-area cases not linked to travel or exposure to people who might have been infected abroad, that means the virus has gone from being an imported phenomenon to taking up residence in Washington state, health officials say.At least 18 cases, including six deaths, were connected to a long-term nursing facility for the elderly, called LifeCare Center of Kirkland, in a Seattle suburb.Seattle health authorities urged a number of measures for curbing further spread of the disease, including recommendations for anyone aged 60 and older and individuals with underlying chronic health problems or compromised immunity to stay home and away from large gatherings and public places.They also urged companies to allow their employees to work from home as much as possible, stagger shifts to ease commuter congestion on public transportation and avoid large work-related gatherings when possible.""The distancing measures that we're recommending are essential because we need to slow the spread of the disease to the point where we are able to continue to handle the load,"" said Patty Hayes, the public health director for Seattle and King County.A growing number of US companies are adopting such steps. On Wednesday Microsoft Corp asked its employees in the Seattle region near its headquarters and in the San Francisco Bay Area to work from home if possible until March 25.In New York state, the number of cases rose to 10 on Wednesday. Three family members and a neighbor of a lawyer who was previously identified as infected tested positive. The neighbor's wife and three of his children have also contracted the virus, Governor Andrew Cuomo said.About 1,000 people in suburban Westchester County, where the two families live, were under self-quarantine orders because of possible exposure, Cuomo said.""We are, if anything, being overcautious,"" he said.AIPAC, the pro-Israel lobby, said Wednesday that people in a group from New York that attended its 18,000-person policy conference in Washington, D.C., this week potentially had been in contact with an individual who contacted the coronavirus before the conference.Dozens of Congress members attended the conference, as well as Vice President Mike Pence.US lawmakers reached bipartisan agreement on an $8.3 billion emergency bill to help fund efforts to contain the virus. The bill garnered enough votes to pass in the House of Representatives.The Senate is expected to act quickly so President Donald Trump can sign the measure into law.More than $3 billion would be devoted to research and development of coronavirus vaccines, test kits and therapeutics. There are currently no approved vaccines or treatments for the fast-spreading illness.The administration is working to allow laboratories to develop their own coronavirus tests without seeking regulatory approval first, US Health Secretary Alex Azar said.The latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention listed 129 confirmed and presumed cases in the United States, up from the previous 108. They were 80 reported by public health authorities in 13 states plus 49 among people repatriated from abroad, according to the CDC website.Those figures do not necessarily reflect Wednesday's updates from three states.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74485203,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-112778,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/california-declares-emergency-over-coronavirus-as-death-toll-rises-in-us/articleshow/74485198.cms

VARANASI: Three south Indians ferrying huge quantities of psychotropic drugs — apparently meant for export to Malaysia concealed in saris — were nabbed on board Rajdhani Express at Deen Dayal Upadhyay station in Chandauli district on Tuesday night.

The Varanasi unit of DRI led the crackdown to find 49.24kg of narcotics, primarily amphetamine, worth over Rs 14.7 crore at Rs 30 lakh a kilo. DRI officials have conceded that this is the biggest seizure of amphetamine in recent memory.

The trio — identified as Riyas Abdul Kalam of Kollam district in Kerala, and Vimal Raj and Jumma Khan of Sivaganga district in Tamil Nadu — have been arrested and booked under the NDPS Act, 1985.

According to reports, the DRI unit received a tip-off about the synthetic drug consignment being carried from New Delhi to Kolkata on board Rajdhani. The team from Varanasi comprising senior intelligence officers Anand Rai, Lekh Raj, Mukund Singh and Anant Dwivedi searched coach A-1 of train 12314 (New Delhi-Sealdah Rajdhani Express) and found the drugs packed in luggage.

The drugs were reportedly meant to be exported to Malaysia via Kolkata. The plan was to conceal it in a cargo of saris. The syndicate involved in the trade is reportedly based in Chennai. Investigations are on to zero in on the gang.

AHMEDABAD: Nikita Patel had to skip Class XII board exams twice due to unsuitable seating arrangement at the exam centre. She got some respite this year after the board officials made some last-minute changes for her. But her troubles are far from over as her centre is about 12km from her residence.

Patel had an accident a few years ago and the resulting paraplegia makes her use a wheelchair. She was earlier allotted an exam hall on the third floor. She is a resident of Mahadev Nagar in Vastral but her exam centre this year is at the distant Krushnanagar Vidya Vihar , said Ashwin Patel, her father.

Earlier this week, he approached some senior government officials in Gandhinagar who agreed to accommodate her on the ground floor.

""They, however, refused to change the exam centre. My daughter had attached her disability certificate with the exam forms, which was overlooked,"" Patel said. ""There are four to five centres near our house and we had requested that any one of them be allotted."" He said that his daughter will take the exams although she will face inconvenience.

Nikita, who had scored 78% in Class X, fell from a swing which caused an injury to the spinal cord and paralyzed her lower limbs. She changed streams from science to general as a result, according to her father.

""In 2018 and 2019, my daughter, who is an external student, had to skip two successive exams as the classroom allotted to her was on the third floor,"" Patel said. ""In both the instances, the centre was far from our residence. The board needs to be more sensitive towards students suffering from disabilities.""

No casualty was reported and no one suffered injuries.

Due to the effective fire safety systems installed in the building, the blaze was doused in 35 minutes and Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Service (AFES) vehicles were not needed, said a fire official.

MF Dastoor , chief fire official of AFES, said the fire occurred at around 4.15pm in the high-rise building.

“We sent seven fire fighters to douse the flames, but they were not needed as the fire extinguishers installed in the building did the task,” said Dastoor.

No casualty was reported as the two flats where the fire occurred were vacant and the owner was scheduled to move in on April 6. Another fire official said the fire may have been sparked by a bidi or a short circuit on the 14th floor, where carpenters were working. “The flames spread to the wood and foam being used to make the furniture, and then to other pieces of furniture,” said the fire official.

Residents of other blocks informed residents of O block about the fire. A security guard, Sureshsingh Rajput , first spotted the fire and called the fire brigade.

KOCHI: With Kerala water authority (KWA) and local body failing to address the issue of acute drinking water shortage at Varappuzha grama panchayat, an NGO has come up for providing relief to the aggrieved villagers. Ernakulam district committee of Human Rights Protection Mission, an NGO, has started supply of drinking water in wards 11 and 12 of the panchayat.

According to the residents of Thundathumkadavu , the area has been reeling under acute shortage of drinking water. ""Still, the panchayat authorities are not providing adequate drinking water in the area. Despite having sufficient funds, the local body authorities are providing just a truckload of drinking water every day. Local residents told us that the panchayat authorities are turning a deaf ear to their call for drinking water,"" said Human Rights Protection Mission district president Stephan Joseph. There are more than 200 families in the area.

Shortage of drinking water is reported from many places in Kochi corporation limits and surrounding areas. Though, the demand for potable water is around 370 million litres daily (MLD), KWA is able to provide only up to 300 MLD.

KOCHI: A group of nature lovers under the banner of Green Grace would create a human chain at the 'green lung' of Kalamassery - the wooded area spread over 72 acres on the Hindustan Machine Tools (HMT) campus - at 4pm on Friday. The event is being organized as part of the global climate strike action to protect biodiversity .

According to organizers, the urban canopy, which is home to scores of bird species and rich in biodiversity, is facing grave threats.

""We are trying to have student participation for the programme. Our plan is to organize a human chain to symbolically protect the site,"" said Cochin Natural History Society (CNHS) secretary Vishnupriyan Kartha.

""There has been many wildfires in HMT Estate in recent time necessitating intervention of fire force, and people have to exercise caution while working there,"" he said.

As per a survey undertaken by birders, close to 180 bird species have been spotted in the area. Recorded number of plant species is 65. Around 74 species of butterflies, including state butterfly Papilio buddha, can be found here. Around six species of mammals and 35 types of spiders have also been identified.

The Kerala forest department has recognized the bird diversity of Kalamasssery by releasing a poster mentioning 191 species of birds, including many endangered species.

Green Grace had earlier produced a documentary 'Urban Canopy', which documented the rich biodiversity of the area. CNHS had earlier written to HMT general technical manager requesting them to take steps for conserving the urban forest-like green cover on its Kalamassery campus.

China's death toll now stands at 3,012, with over 80,000 infections.From western Europe to eastern Asia, supermarket shelves have been stripped of supplies in recent weeks, including toilet paper and hand sanitiser.American businesses are increasingly concerned over access to goods and the overall economic outlook is more uncertain, the US Federal Reserve said in its beige book survey released on Wednesday.With the US toll rising to 11 on Wednesday, lawmakers in Congress reached a deal to provide more than $8 billion to fight the outbreak.The virus impact has spread beyond supply chains -- stock markets have rumbled as warnings from financial bodies mount that countries could be pushed into recession.The IMF said the epidemic posed a ""serious threat"" and would slow global growth to below last year's 2.9 percent.""At a time of uncertainty... it is better to do more than to do not enough,"" IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said.The epidemic ""is a global problem calling for global response,"" she said.Eurozone ministers agreed after a meeting that they were ready to ""use all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth"".As the virus continues its march across the world, governments are scrambling to tighten prevention efforts.Italy has seen its outbreak swell despite tough measures, including a quarantine of 11 towns with 50,000 people.New measures include a month-long nationwide ban on fan attendance at sports events, as well as advising people to avoid greetings like kissing on the cheek or shaking hands.Prime Minister Giuseppe Conti said the country could tackle the outbreak as long as it remained contained.""But in case of exponential growth, not just Italy but any other country in the world would not be able to manage the situation,"" he said.In Iran, where 92 people have died from the disease, schools have been shut and major cultural and sporting events suspended.Saudi Arabia has suspended the year-round ""umrah"" pilgrimage, an unprecedented move that raises fresh uncertainty over the annual hajj.Countries also continue to crack down on international travel.Israel extended its mandatory quarantine measures -- already in place for travellers from Italy and some Asian countries -- to cover people from France, Germany, Spain, Austria and Switzerland.Even cinemagoers were not immune from the effects of the virus -- the producers of the latest James Bond film pushed back the release of the forthcoming ""No Time To Die"" from April to November.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74485377,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-130643,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/coronavirus-290-million-students-out-of-school-as-global-virus-battle-intensifies/articleshow/74485349.cms

At least four of these flying machines would be able to go beyond 3.5km and remain airborne for a long period. Cops will be using these as long-range drones for now.The rest will be closerange drones with a range of 2km. The estimated price has been fixed at Rs 72 lakh in the tender document. The police have three drones at present.Police said that with several protests in the city, maintaining vigil has become a challenge. “There are several short-notice protests and it is not always possible to keep track of all the protesters. A few people are enough to create a large-scale disturbance. Monitoring through cameras helps us take immediate action and develop critical evidence,” an officer said.There is a larger objective too. With the KMC elections scheduled this year followed by assembly polls next year, the police will have a busy time ahead. “Technology is always a boon and drones, over the years, have proved nifty. The Special Task Force (STF) will be assigned to use the drones. The detective department, too, will play a crucial part,” he added.The new short-range variety should weigh less than 4kg and can reach a maximum launch altitude of 3,000 AMSL (above mean sea level). It should be able to endure temperatures between 0°C and 40°C and withstand wind over 18 knots. It should have a deployment time of less than five minutes and packing time of 10 minutes.In contrast, the four close-range drones should weight no more than 2kg each, but must be able to a similar launch altitude as the short-range ones. It should be able to endure wind speeds up to 6 knots. It should come with Autonomous Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) facility.The drone was initially inducted in the force as an essential law-and-order tool. The lone drone procured more than half a decade ago — at a cost of Rs 40 lakh — was primarily assigned to send footage of large gatherings.By 2013, Kolkata Police had deployed the drone to tackle the biggest event in the state — Durga Puja. Ironically, it took a massive scare at a high-rise when a fire was reported on the 17th floor of the building a year later, for cops to deploy a drone for the first time in a crisis. Since then, the drone has been a constant companion for major disasters in the city — whether it was the Majerhat Bridge collapse last year or the Bagri market fire. On a couple of occasions, the drone tracked suspected cars at night too.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74485391,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-505309,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-cops-to-get-8-drones-to-keep-vigil-on-protests/articleshow/74485365.cms

BHOPAL: A 'magical mohua tree' in Betul district of MP, rumoured to be a cure-all and drawing hundreds looking for miracles, has been uprooted. The district administration says it doesn't know who toppled it.

The tree stood next to a farm in Seeta Dhana village in Bhainsdehi tehsil, some 250km from Bhopal . Around a fortnight ago, rumours spread that touching the tree can cure you of any illness, triggering a mad rush like the one that led to law-and-order trouble in Hoshangabad district a few months ago.

Despite attempts by local administration to uproot superstition, the crowd at the tree got bigger by the day. Locals claimed that the tree ""emitted electricity"", curing people of diseases. One day, the 'devotees' turned up to see the tree upended.

""It was getting worrisome and leading to a law-and-order situation. On March 1, I visited the spot and advised people to be calm. I also discussed with the farmer in whose field the tree stood. He too was worried (by the crowds) and said the tree could lead him to lose his farm,"" Bhainsdehi subdivisional magistrate Radheyshyam Baghel told TOI, adding: ""We also advised locals that if they want to worship, barriers should be erected and we will also deploy police."" The tree was apparently uprooted later that day.

""It was the next day that I came to know that the tree has been uprooted. A probe has been ordered.

""There are some trees for which permission is required from higher level, and some trees like 'mohua' can be cut with permission from the local tehsildar. If the farm owner got it uprooted, we will see if he took permission. If anyone is found guilty, then appropriate action will be taken,"" Baghel said.

KOLKATA: Three days after some participants in the Amit Shah rally raised the ""Goli maaro"" slogan in central Kolkata, three more people were rounded up in late-night raids on Tuesday, taking the total arrests to eight. All were slapped with the non-bailable charge of trying to promote enmity between groups through provocative slogans.

Scanning CCTV footage and videos for those raising objectionable slogans at the rally, police traced Prasanta Sarkar (50) to his home at Sodepur in North 24 Parganas and Mukesh Singh (34) to an area near the Howrah station. Both were produced in a chief metropolitan magistrate court on Wednesday and sent to police custody till March 6. ""Sarkar and Singh are active BJP workers.

The third arrested person is a also a BJP worker, who was picked up from Liluah by the Howrah City Police. Bhanu Singh has been sent to police custody for seven days.

According to sources, police have identified around 25 people who had shouted the ""goli maaro"" slogan in the rally. Two of the persons arrested on Monday, Pankaj Prasad and Surendra Kumar Tewary, were on Wednesday remanded in judicial custody till March 6 after the defence lawyer claimed cops had not unearthed anything worthwhile while keeping them in their custody. ""In court, I said none of the accused sent to police custody had been questioned by police. The prosecution could only produce a statement under Sec CrPc 161.

AHMEDABAD: A family court on Wednesday ordered that a 25-year-old man be put behind bars for 480 days for not paying maintenance to his estranged wife and disobeying a court order.

The court issued an arrest warrant for Mohammed Afzal Shaikh , a resident of Danilimda , and directed the city police commissioner to execute the warrant. This happened because Shaikh's wife, Aksa (21), requested the court to recover the maintenance money from her husband, said Aksa's advocate, Salim Saiyed.

The court ordered 480 days in jail for Shaikh because he defaulted on maintenance for this number of days. He was supposed to pay Rs 81,000 to his wife upon a court order.

According to Saiyed, the couple married in 2018 but the woman left the matrimonial home because of marital discord. She moved the family court and sought maintenance from her husband, who is in the transport business.

On November 14, 2019, the court ordered the husband to pay Rs 5,000 monthly maintenance to his wife from July 17, 2018, the day she had filed the application. The court also ordered him to pay Rs 1,000 to his wife towards legal expenditure. In November 2019, Aksa filed another application in the court and urged the court to recover the dues of Rs 81,000 as ordered from her husband.

The man did not heed the court summons. The court finally passed an order for a jail term for the man equal to the number of days he had defaulted on the payment and issued an arrest warrant, the woman's lawyer said.

The nets were also dry and neatly packed with no sign of fishing activity,” an officer involved in the operation told TOI.ICG divers attached to the antismuggling unit in Mandapam searched the spot for nearly two hours but could not find anything. The area was cordoned off and guarded by ICG vessels till Wednesday morning when the search resumed. Meanwhile, DRI personnel found a GPS device on the boat with a specific location marked on it. When asked about it, the men confessed to smuggling gold and abandoning it at the place so they could go back and retrieve it later.On Wednesday, a team of 20 personnel and officers from the ICG and the DRI including three divers conducted a search with the help of a hovercraft and interceptor craft.After about 2 hours, the divers found a cloth pack with five black packs in it. Back on the shore, when the package was opened, they found gold biscuits concealed in one of the packs. It was handed over to DRI for further investigations. The source of the gold, the destination and the reason behind dropping it in the sea are being probed. ICG officials said this was the first time the DRI approached them for an operation in the sea.Sources said names of the duo could not be revealed as it could help others involved in the act go underground. On Wednesday evening, DRI sleuths picked up two men from Maraikayar Pattinam village in Tuticorin for questioning for their suspected role in the smuggling.",madurai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74485652,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-136223,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tamil-nadu-coast-guard-men-dive-deep-to-retrieve-14kg-smuggled-gold-at-gulf-of-mannar/articleshow/74485426.cms

PATNA: Seven persons, including a driver and former guard of Chatth Dham apartment, were arrested on Wednesday for their alleged involvement in jewellery and other valuables loot from a flat of chartered accountant A Bandopadhayay on February 27.

Bandopadhayay and his wife, both in their early 70s, were alone when four armed criminals barged into their flat around 7pm and decamped with valuables after staying there for 20 minutes. They had also thrashed the couple. The apartment is located at Rajendra Nagar under Kadamkuan police station in state capital.

Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said those arrested were identified as former guard Manoj Kumar , driver Santosh Kumar Manjhi, jeweller Anil Prasad, Manish Kumar , Vijay Kumar, Bittu Kumar and Sonu Kumar. ""They were arrested from different places in Patna, Vaishali and Saran districts. Criminals had given the looted jewellery to Anil for selling at Garkha in Saran,"" he said.

""Santosh worked as a driver of Bandopadhayay's neighbour while Manoj lived in a single room on the apartment's terrace for more than 15 years even after leaving the guard's job. Manoj had roped in Santosh for loot. They thought the couple had jewellery and cash worth several lakh in their flat,"" the SSP said.

He said Manoj had contacted one more person in Saran through which four criminals were hired for the loot. ""Manoj cut the CCTV camera cable in the apartment almost a week before the incident while Santosh went to Kolkata for avoiding suspicion. It surfaced during investigation that Manoj was moving on a two-wheeler in front of the apartment during the loot,"" the SSP said.

NEW DELHI: The investigation into the death of intelligence official Ankit Sharma , according to multiple sources, indicates that there was a strong possibility of it being a ""targeted killing"" and not a random act of violence.

The police have pieced together an initial sequence of events. Sharma had returned from office around 5pm on February 25 and stepped out with his friends. He, along with his friend, Kalu, and a few others were on one side of a 'pulia' (small bridge) while heavy stone-pelting was on from the other side. Sharma was at the front.

Eyewitnesses have told police that Sharma tripped over a stone and fell. Three-four men came from the other side and overpowered Sharma, who was then dragged away to the other side. ""Curiously, they did not touch anyone else but him,"" said a source.

Sharma was possibly taken to a confined location (a house) as nobody saw him after. That's where he is suspected to have been stripped and brutalised. His body was then dragged to the drain and dumped. The body, which had only undergarments on it, was fished out from the drain the next day.

The intelligence establishment - after analysing the prima facie sequence of events, some statements and initial medical opinion - is convinced that Sharma's death appeared to be a murder with a motive. ""The sequence indicates that the killers may have been trying to send across a message. This is bigger than what meets the eye,"" a senior intelligence officer told TOI on Wednesday.

While the exact number of injuries on his body are not clear yet, doctors conducting the post-mortem had told a cop present there that it had at least 54 deep stab wounds.

Talking about 'targeted killing' becoming the strongest line of probe, an investigator said: ""The fact that Sharma was abducted and taken away and not killed or harmed at the spot by the mob had raised suspicion at first. The theory has only been strengthened as the sequence of events has become clearer. Vengeance is clearly visible by the condition of the body. Nobody is killed like this usually by a mob,"" he added.

Asked if they had any leads on suspects, a senior police officer said they were trying to identify the people who dragged him away based on the details of their appearance as recalled by eyewitnesses. ""Leads from technical surveillance in the area is awaited. We are also trying to trace a group of Bangladeshi criminals whose location has come in the area around that time,"" he added.

243,['5/03/2020'],"Maharashtra: Exiled for extra-marital fling, 'killer' Maoist in police net","Representative image

GADCHIROLI: One of the wanted Maoist masterminds of the Jambhulkheda blast last year that killed 15 Maharashtra policemen and a driver was on Wednesday arrested along with his second wife on the outskirts of Gadchiroli, where he had been left to fend for himself after ostensibly falling out with fellow cadres over his extra-marital relationship.

Dinkar Gota, a divisional committee member of the Korchi Dalam's north Gadchiroli unit, and his second wife Sunanda Koreti together had a bounty of Rs 18 lakh on their heads. The NIA might seek Gota's custody for its probe into the blast case, officials said.

Gota has a total of 108 offences against his name, including 33 murders. He along with two absconding Maoist functionaries - Bhaskar Hichami and Satish ؙ- are suspected to have planned and executed the arson at Dadapur village on May 1 last year in which 400-500 cadres torched 36 vehicles of a road construction company.

The Maoists later booby-trapped a police quick-response team on its way to Purada police station to investigate the arson. The team, led by then SDPO Shailesh Kale, drove straight into the trap laid by the attackers at Jambhulkheda. As soon as the private vehicle ferrying them reached a small bridge over Lendhari Nullah, an IED blast killed all 16 inside.

While Gota eluded capture for almost a year after the twin attacks, his private life seemingly proved his undoing. Sources said the Maoist functionary fell foul of Korchi Dalam's top-rung functionaries over his decision to leave his first wife Sunita. The latter, a member of the Tippagarh Dalam, surrendered last year after her husband grew close to Sunanda, who has 38 police cases registered against her.

It was after Sunita's surrender that the outfit issued a strict warning to Gota to dissociate himself from Sunanda. He was on the verge of being suspended when he deserted the group along with Sunanda last September, sources said .

Gadchiroli SP Shailesh Balkawade said there was ""a strong rumour"" earlier this year about Gota being killed by his fellow cadres. ""We were hot on his trail since he left the outfit. The arrest of Gota and his wife is the outcome of the cumulative effort of our intelligence unit, technical cell and the special investigation team.""Sources said Gota and Sunanda had been living a quiet life in relative anonymity at a village near the police headquarters. Their mobile phones ultimately gave them away.

Balkawade said separate cases had been registered against the duo for the Dadapur arson and the Jambhulkheda blast. ""We have arrested Gota and Sunanda as part of the Dadapur arson probe and got a 14-day remand.""

In another success, Gadchiroli police busted a Maoist camp in the Khobramenda forest on the northern side of the district early on Wednesday. Around 70-80 Maoists were attending a camp when C-60 commandos stormed the place.

And naturally so, people are fearing every person who is coughing, sneezing or complaining of breathing issues. While it is important to be cautious, one shouldn’t panic. According to lifestyle coach Luke Coutinho, “Panic and fear solve no problems and actually raise cortisol levels which lowers immunity. And that is the quickest way for any virus to impact your health. Stay calm.”Dr Karan Madan, pulmonologist, AIIMS shared, “Most coronavirus symptoms are similar to common cold and flu. If you have mild symptoms, we would not recommend testing for coronavirus. If you have low grade fever, cough, it is best to rest and have lots of fluids. This isn’t the first coronavirus. There are 4 coronavirus types that are already in circulation and may cause slight respiratory issues. This is the 7th one and we need to look for patients demonstrating serious symptoms like high grade fever, breathlessness.”Dr Madan further added, “Influenza and coronavirus have similar symptoms. Right now it is difficult to substantiate it medically. So if you have a runny nose, slight cold and fever, you just need to focus on recovering by taking ample rest and maybe antiviral medicines.”Professor Ramanan Laxminarayan, director for Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, “If you are an elderly with other comorbidities, or have a heart issue, are a stroker or have severe respiratory issue, then you have more to worry about because unlike the 1982 pandemic which attacked most young population, this one is impacting more of elderly.”Talking about the preventive measures, he said, “Wash your hands, do not touch your face, exercise good hygiene practices, do not shake hands, and maintain distance from people who appear sick.” The vaccine for coronavirus may be 8-12 months away.If you are suspicious of some surface, get some hydrogen peroxide to clean it.

VIJAYAWADA: A day after urging the Centre to remove the additional questions in NPR 2020, the AP Cabinet on Wednesday decided to keep National Population Register (NPR) in abeyance in the state. The NPR 2020 has several new questions added when compared to the previous exercise carried out in 2010. The additional questions relate to place and date of birth of the parents of the head of family.

The AP Cabinet felt that the government had received negative feedback from the people on the proposed implementation of NPR 2020. People have been raising objections to some of the additional questions included in the NPR and some sections of people are apprehensive of the intentions of the data collected during the exercise.

On Tuesday chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy made an appeal to the Central government to revert to the 2010 questions for the NPR 2020. The issue was discussed in the state Cabinet meeting on Wednesday.

The Cabinet appealed to the Central government to limit the questions to the 2010 NPR and drop the new questions added to the list to seek information from citizens. As the Central government is yet to respond, the state Cabinet had decided to keep the NPR exercise in abeyance.

Minister for information and public relations Perni Venkatramayya (Nani) told media persons that the Cabinet had discussed the objections received from several sections of people and felt that the objections were reasonable. ""The doubts of the people are to be cleared and their objections are to be honoured and answered,"" the minister said.

THANE: Thane municipal chief Sanjeev Jaiswal on Wednesday announced his voluntary exit from the corporation where he had served for over five years and two months even as formal orders regarding his transfer from the government are yet to be issued. Jaiswal, an IAS officer of the 1996 batch, has proceeded on leave for a fortnight. He has been seeking a transfer since 2018.

It is learnt recent differences within his team over internal transfers proved to be the breaking point.

Jaiswal, who is known to have had an action-packed tenure, said he is embarking on a 10-day “detox tour” to the north, including Himachal Pradesh and Dharamshala, starting Thursday, and has handed over charge to his subordinate, additional commissioner Rajendra Ahiwar .

Jaiswal’s exit, just days before the civic budget, has taken both activists and politicians by surprise. While he refused to cite the reason for his sudden exit, it is learnt the commissioner was upset over an alleged “vertical split” in the administration with a few subordinates seeking political intervention in a series of transfers. Jaiswal has been in the news for frequent tiffs with the political class during his tenure.

He told mediapersons on Wednesday it was his final interaction with them and he did not wish to continue and was awaiting his next posting. He said he was happy as the lake city’s residents had showered him with love.

Meanwhile, he is believed to have surrendered his official car on Wednesday and is also likely to vacate his official bungalow at Patalipada in Thane and relocate to a personal residence in Bandra after he returns from the north.

253,['5/03/2020'],Google assistant: How hackers are looking to target Google Assistant and Apple’s Siri,"NEW DELHI: Humans are not able to hear ultrasonic frequencies but smartphones are capable of that and hackers are now trying to exploit this functionality. According to a latest research finding, using this ultrasonic wave trick hackers can hack Google Assistant and Siri on your smartphones.

According to research carried out by Washington University , hackers can use the guided ultrasonic waves to fool the voice assistants and make them perform various actions. These actions include taking pictures, making calls, sending text messages and also just the volumes.

The researchers mention in a note, “By leveraging the unique properties of acoustic transmission in solid materials, we design a new attack called SurfingAttack that would enable multiple rounds of interactions between the voice-controlled device and the attacker over a longer distance and without the need to be in line-of-sight. By completing the interaction loop of inaudible sound attack, SurfingAttack enables new attack scenarios, such as hijacking a mobile Short Message Service (SMS) passcode, making ghost fraud calls without owners' knowledge, etc.”

The team also mentions that the Surfing Attack worked on tables made from glass, wood, and metal.

How does SurfingAttack work

SurfingAttack modulates the voice command onto an inaudible frequency band and transmits attack signals using an off-the-shelf PZT transducer (cost $5 per piece) through different types of tables made of solid materials.

The researchers also said that they tested this hack on 17 different smartphones which include smartphones from Google, Apple, Samsung, Motorola and Xiaomi , and the attacks worked on all the devices. The research also mentioned that the attack will also work on smartphones that have silicone cases.

In order to protect your smartphones from such hacks, the team has advised users to use thicker smartphone cases such as the one made from wood. Along with this, it also advises users to place a phone on the table which has a tablecloth as this disables the activation of the voice assistant.

NEW DELHI: At Al Hind hospital in Mustafabad , tragedy and celebration managed to co-exist briefly on Tuesday. Around 5pm, the terrace of the hospital became the venue for a hurried wedding ceremony. The sombre affair had no elaborate feasts and the guest list comprised doctors and nurses, who even chipped in for the bride's attire.

The bride, 19-year-old Rukhsar, was originally supposed to get married at a mosque near her home in Shiv Vihar on March 3. But on February 25, her family lost everything after her home was burned down in the violence that hit the area. Even the groom's family went back on their word and cancelled the wedding. But Rukhsar saw a glimmer of hope after a relative found another match for her.

""We lost everything - money, jewellery and clothes for the wedding. The house is beyond repair. But miraculously, we found another groom for Rukhsar,"" said her mother, Saba Parveen .

The young groom, 22-year-old Feroze, works as a delivery executive with a food delivery company. ""They had lost everything and were worried about their daughter's future. So, my father thought it best that the wedding take place as scheduled. He had my consent,"" said Feroze, a resident of east Delhi's Krishna Nagar.

Parveen said initially they thought that they would postpone the wedding, but then decided to go forward as she wasn't sure about their safety in the neighbourhood. ""We wanted to make sure Rukhsar is safe,"" she said.

When TOI visited Al-Hind on Wednesday, at least 60 people, including Rukhsar's family, were living there as ""refugees"". The two-storey hospital had been converted into a relief centre and carpets were laid on the ground to house the displaced families. The hospital gained limelight after Justice Muralidhar 'a midnight order on February 26, which directed policemen to ensure that an ambulance reach the building safely.

Parveen's family moved to Al-Hind on February 26 on learning about the relief camp. Volunteers are cooking food outside on the road and then distributing it among the residents here. Several people have pitched in with grains, oil and other essentials.

The staff is overburdened with work but confident that they will pull through. ""The first-aid work is over. But victims are still coming in to get their dressings changed. There are over a dozen patients here, including one with bullet injury. We are working round the clock to ensure medical aid to everyone,"" said Razia , a 21-year-old nurse.

Razia was referring to 22-year-old Danish, who sustained a bullet injury in his right thigh on February 24. He was earlier shifted to GTB hospital, which discharged him after five days. But on Tuesday, his injury started showing signs of infection, following which he had to be admitted to Al-Hind.

""We could not take him to GTB again because they discharged him before he was well. We are praying for his recovery,"" said Danish's mother, Ishrat.

The global release of the new James Bond film ' No Time to Die ' was postponed on Wednesday by seven months amid the coronavirus disruption that has closed movie theatres in China and caused widespread headaches for other Hollywood productions.The release of Daniel Craig 's last outing as agent 007, being distributed internationally by Universal Pictures , will be postponed from the start of April until November, producers said.""After careful consideration and thorough evaluation of the global theatrical marketplace, the release of NO TIME TO DIE will be postponed until November 2020,"" a posting on the official James Bond Twitter account said.The posting made no specific reference to coronavirus but follows reports in entertainment trade media last week of the cancellation of plans for the film's red carpet premiere in China, Hollywood's biggest overseas market.Movie theatres have been closed in China since January and other nations, including Japan, South Korea and parts of Italy, are also closing theatres in a bid to stem the spread of the virus.The Bond franchise is one of the movie world's most lucrative, with 2015's 'Spectre' raking in $880 million at the box office worldwide, while 'Skyfall' in 2012 grossed more than $1 billion globally.'No Time to Die' cost an estimated $200 million to produce and was due to open in movie theatres from April 2 after a world premiere in London on March 31.The James Bond postponement followed coronavirus disruptions to filming new movies and TV shows and delays in releasing U.S. movies in China.A planned three-week shoot in Venice, Italy, for Tom Cruise 's new 'Mission: Impossible' film was postponed last week due to the outbreak, and producers of the CBS television global competition show 'The Amazing Race' said last week they had temporarily suspended filming of a new season.James Bond fan sites had also written to the studios behind the film this week, urging for a delay.""With the Coronavirus reaching pandemic status, it is time to put public health above marketing release schedules and the cost of cancelling publicity events,"" fan website MI6-HQ.com wrote in an open letter.""We have all waited over 4 years for this film.

257,['5/03/2020'],Madhya Pradesh: Was defection drama over 9 extra votes that BJP needs for second Rajya Sabha seat?,"The CM’s House in Bhopal was abuzz with activity on Wednesday

BHOPAL: Several political observers are interpreting the political drama that unfolded in Madhya Pradesh over the past couple of days in light of the March 26 election to three Rajya Sabha seats. Election would be held on the seats being vacated by senior Congress leader Digvjijaya Singh and BJP leaders Prabhat Jha and Satyanarayan Jatia.

As the equations stand now in the House, Congress can hope to win two seats while one seat will surely go to BJP. But BJP is keen to retain both its seats, and needs nine additional MLAs — almost the exact number that went ‘missing’ from the ruling alliance camp. And the drama that unfolded in the past couple of days is being seen as an attempt to bring the MLAs into their fold.

On the other hand, Congress needs just two more seats to wrest one from BJP while retaining one. Independent legislator Pradeep Jaiswal is a cabinet minister in the Kamal Nath government and will vote with Congress. Therefore, Congress would need only one additional vote beyond its strength of 114 in the House to and take two of the three seats. In normal circumstances, getting one vote from its six other allies (two MLAs from BSP, one of SP and three independents) is no challenge for Congress.

What’s more, BJP is facing the jitters as two of its MLAs — Sharad Kol and Narayan Tripathi — who had voted with Congress in the assembly in July last year and have repeatedly praised CM Kamal Nath, skipped the introductory meet with BJP state chief V D Sharma on Tuesday evening. Congress seems to be placed comfortably for the Rajya Sabha poll.

“There could be some challenge for Congress only when BJP does something drastic, like defection of nine or more MLAs of Congress and the small groups supporting the Nath government. The drama that unfolded over the past couple of days was, perhaps, an attempt in that direction but timely action by our party, particularly Digvijaya Singh , scuttled the attempt,” a senior PCC functionary told TOI.

Former principal secretary of MP Vidhan Sabha, Bhagwandev Israni , while talking of provisions of anti-defection law, said: “If six or eight Congress MLAs had voted against the Congress candidate in violation of the party whip, they would have lost membership of the House, but their votes would have been valid.”

As the situation stands now, each of the three RS candidates will have to get at least 58 votes to win, said Vidhan Sabha principal secretary A P Singh. “Congress, on its own, can get 58 and 56 votes for its two candidates, while BJP will get 58 and 49, if they contest two seats. So, Congress has to get just two additional seats while it has support of seven MLAs from outside and the BJP has none,” said Singh.

While names of senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh and AICC general secretary Jyotiraditya Scindia are said to be among the top choices from the ruling party, it would be interesting to see who gets priority — the one to get 58 first-choice votes.

On the other hand, BJP has several heavyweights in contention for nomination to Rajya Sabha, say sources — from incumbent Rajya Sabha member Prabhat Jha to former Union minister Uma Bharti and BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya .

SRINAGAR: For the first time after the nullification of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, the Union territory administration on Wednesday allowed citizens access to social media. Though 2G mobile internet services were restored in Kashmir from January 25, this is the first time in seven months that access has been given to social media platforms.

However, the access is only on 2G mobile data services and fixed line internet provided by private players. Fixed line internet services by BSNL are yet to be operational. Moreover, the access to the websites, including social media platforms, will be given till March 17, according to a notification of J&K home department.

Communication links in the Union territory were snapped on August 5 last year when the Centre ended the special status enjoyed by J&K. Phone links were restored in the subsequent months and on January 25, access only to 300 white-listed sites (including websites related to emails, banking, education, jobs, travel, entertainment etc) was restored for a week. This was periodically extended. The fresh order by the home department came hours before the previous extension was set to expire on Wednesday midnight.

“Internet access across the Union Territory with internet speed restricted to 2G only and internet connectivity with MAC-binding to continue till 17 March, 2020. The directions to remain in force unless modified earlier. While the postpaid SIM card holders shall continue to be provided access to the internet, these services shall not be made available on prepaid SIM cards unless verified as per norms applicable for postpaid connections,” said the order, issued by J&K principal secretary (home) Shaleen Kabra.

The order was issued after assessing the reports of law enforcing agencies and the impact of telecom services regulation on the overall security situation.

About fixed line internet connectivity, Kabra said it would continue to be made available with MAC-binding, which essentially means to make a client machine work from a particular internet protocol (IP) address.

“It is further directed that the access/communication facilities provided by the government, viz e-terminals/internet kiosks apart from special arrangements for tourists, students, traders, etc. shall continue,” Kabra said.

Kabra asked the police chiefs of Jammu and Kashmir divisions to communicate the home department’s directions to service providers and ensure implementation with immediate effect.

While continuing the ban on social media, authorities had last month said that anti-national elements and people across the border were “misusing” these networking sites allowing peer-to-peer communication and virtual private networks (VPNs). Internet service providers (ISPs) were asked to ensure access to 1,674 white-listed sites only and not to any social media applications.

262,['5/03/2020'],"I was offered Rs 35 crore to switch to BJP, says Congress MLA Parmar","Mahesh Parmar

BHOPAL/INDORE: At the peak of Wednesday’s political drama, Congress MLA from Tarana seat — Mahesh Parmar — claimed that he was one of those contacted by BJP to switch loyalties.

At the Pradesh Congress Committee headquarters on Wednesday, Parmar told TOI: “On Monday, I received a call from former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan . He said that I will be given a ministerial berth if I switched loyalties and join BJP.”

Parmar alleged that he was offered Rs 35 crore along with the ministerial berth. “They promised to give me a ticket, help win the election and also said that I will be looked after by the party throughout my life. Shivraj Singh Chouhan told me that the faster I make the decision, the better,” he said. “The invitation was to go and speak to Chouhan and other BJP leaders”, he said, adding that he immediately informed CM Kamal Nath about the phone call.

The Congress MLA said that since he comes from Ujjain, he vows by Lord Mahakaal that the call came from Chouhan. “If Chouhan denies, let him place a hand on Mahakaal deity and say that I am lying,” he said. “I am loyal to Congress and the BJP ideology is very different from what I believe in. I could never imagine joining that party,” Parmar added.

Chouhan has denied all such allegations, saying BJP doesn’t indulge in horse-trading. On the other hand, as mystery continued over where Congress MLA Hardeep Singh Dang is, his supporters demanded that he be included in the Kamal Nath cabinet. But he would never quit his party, they said.

Dang, the Suwasara legislator, left his home two days ago and is incommunicado ever since. Congress says he has been taken by BJP from a hotel in New Delhi to Bengaluru. His representative Pavan Pandey said, “The MLA’s phone is switched off. He may be out of the city. I had a discussion with him around two days ago. All allegations of BJP tempting him with money are baseless. He belongs to a middle-class family but it doesn’t mean that he would leave Congress. The state government is under no threat.”

Pandey, a close confidante of Dang, acknowledged that the MLAs is unhappy with the state government after his demand for full compensation to farmers for crop loss in last year’s floods in Mandsaur went unheard. But Dang wouldn’t quit Congress, he said. “I want to request chief minister Kamal Nath and our senior leader Meenakshi Natrajan to give Dang a ministerial post. It’s not his wish but the demand of his supporters and local people,” he said.

Voices of dissent have surfaced from the Dang camp in the past. After BJP’s victory in Lok Sabha polls in May last year, rumours were rife about his quitting Congress. He was believed to be unhappy over not being given a ministerial berth in the Nath cabinet. The MLA had, however, dismissed these rumours and asserted that he would not leave Congress.

Bengaluru: In the income-tax matter related to Cognizant's Rs 19,000-crore share buyback that was effected in May 2016, the Supreme Court on Wednesday said the I-T department's communication dated March 22, 2018, may be treated as a show-cause notice and Cognizant is entitled to respond within ten days.

The I-T authority’s 2018 communication refers to a tax demand arising from the buyback. Cognizant had been asked to remit 15% of Rs 19,451 crore as tax, as also surcharge and interest payable, failing which the department would proceed with collection and recovery of taxes. The company's bank accounts were attached by the department following the communication.

Cognizant had placed an application before the Authority of Advance Ruling (AAR) on March 20, 2018, seeking a ruling on the issue whether it was liable to pay tax on the buyback of its shares. The company deposited Rs 495 crore towards tax payment and Rs 2,806 crore was invested in a fixed deposit pending a final decision.

“…We shall not be taken to have dealt with merits and demerits of the rival contentions of the parties. The merits of the matter shall be gone into independently by the concerned authorities without being influenced, in any way, by any of the observations made by the High Court and this Court (Supreme),” Supreme Court judges Uday Umesh Lalit, Indu Malhotra and Hemant Gupta said on Wednesday.

Cognizant had bought back 9.4 million equity shares at a price of Rs 20,297 per share from four of its shareholders and made a total remittance of over Rs 19,000 crore. The four shareholders were Cognizant Technology Solutions , MarketRx, Cognizant (Mauritius) and CSS Investments . The I-T department’s data showed that only Cognizant USA paid capital gains tax of Rs 898 crore in India. Cognizant made the case that the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) between the Indian government and the Mauritius government provided Cognizant Mauritius exemption from tax on capital gains. However, the authorities disputed this.

When TOI contacted Cognizant, the company said its legal team is studying the order.

268,['5/03/2020'],Sunil Joshi named senior national selection panel chief,"Sunil Joshi, Harvinder Singh and Rajesh Chauhan at the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai on Wednesday. (PTI Photo)

MUMBAI: Sticking to zonal system, BCCI's Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) on Wednesday sprung a surprise by naming former India left-arm spinner Sunil Joshi as the new chairman of the senior national selection committee and also picked ex-pacer Harvinder Singh for the five-member panel.

Joshi will replace MSK Prasad from the south zone while Harvinder will replace former central zone selector Gagan Khoda . The CAC, comprising Madan Lal , RP Singh and Sulakshana Naik, took the call.

Yet again, a key Lodha committee reform has been ignored. On the appointment of a selection committee, the Lodha panel had recommended that the decades-long zonal policy of appointing selectors be done away with. Nevertheless, even the previous selection committee appointed post the 2016 Supreme Court order, had included selectors from all five zones.

In another unprecedented decision, seemingly a brainchild of Board president Sourav Ganguly , the CAC will also review this panel's performance after one year and make recommendations accordingly when the term comes up for renewal.

Existing selectors Jatin Paranjpe, Devang Gandhi and Sarandeep Singh will continue to work until the 2020 AGM of the board when their term ends. New selectors will then be brought in on a fresh term to work alongside Joshi and Singh.

With the team for the three-ODI home series against South Africa set to be picked in a day or two, Joshi and Harvinder are set to attend their first selection meeting soon.

When new selectors are appointed at the next AGM to replace Paranjpe, Gandhi and (Sarandeep) Singh, and any candidate then comes in with more experience than Joshi (example: Ajit Agarkar ), the chairman will be replaced. ""We'll think about that when we get there,"" say sources.

Joshi played 15 Tests, 69 ODIs and 160 First Class matches for Karnataka while Singh played three Tests, 16 ODIs and 109 FC games for Railways.

Based on 'Test-match experience,"" the CAC had shortlisted five candidates for interviews - Joshi, Harvinder, Venkatesh Prasad, Rajesh Chauhan and LS Sivaramakrishnan - from a list of 40 applicants. Explaining why Joshi was thought to be the ideal choice, CAC member Madan Lal said: ""First of all, he is experienced and been all over. He is coaching for UP (Uttar Pradesh), and has (coached) with four to five other teams including J&K (Jammu and Kashmir). He has previously worked with Bangladesh (as their spin bowling coach). I asked him about how he handled Bangladesh's selectors. He has done the toughest of jobs and his thoughts were the best. I liked his straightforward nature.""

What the CAC found most impressive about the new selectors is (Lal explained): A) They were very clear about their though process; B) They were very clear and straightforward with their answers; C) Had impressive communication skills"".

The CAC too defended the Board's decision to pick candidates as per the zonal system. ""Our zonal system is the one of the best we have and keeping that in mind, we have picked the best selectors from each zone,"" Lal added.

BCCI 'door open' for Agarkar

MUMBAI: Favourite to come on board as chief selector, Ajit Agarkar has been ignored for the time being because the West Zone already has a representative in the selection panel. It is for the very reason that the BCCI had not sent Agarkar an invite for Wednesday's interview session held at its headquarters in Mumbai.

However, by ignoring the more experienced L Sivaramakrishnan and Venkatesh Prasad from the south zone and opting for Sunil Joshi, the BCCI has left the door open for Agarkar to walk in at the next AGM. Current West Zone selector Jatin Paranjpe's term and tenure will end by then.

BCCI rule says selectors can be appointed on annual contracts that can be renewed for a maximum of four terms. When the time comes for new appointments, the BCCI will once again call for applications and conduct interviews through the same members of the Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC).

272,['5/03/2020'],iPhone of 2020: This may be the latest update on Apple’s much-awaited iPhone of 2020,"NEW DELHI: There have been several reports about Apple gearing up to launch the successor of the iPhone SE. A lot of information has been reported about the alleged iPhone SE 2 — which some reports claimed will be launched as the iPhone 9 — right from the specs to price.

The latest information on this handset comes from MacRumours report that reveals that this iPhone has now entered the “final phase of production verification.” This information has been reported by Taiwanese publication DigitTimes who cites its industry sources.

“New LCD iPhone enters final verification stage: Apple will soon introduce a new LCD iPhone series, dubbed tentatively SE2, which has recently entered the final phase of verification at an assembly plant in Zhengzhou, China, according to industry sources,” said the report.

The iPhone SE 2 has been expected to be launched in March since a long time now, however, due to the worldwide outbreak of the Coronavirus, the possibility of the launch event seems slim, especially with all major tech giants — including Google and Facebook — cancelling their events. Therefore, even if the company does go ahead with a launch in March, it remains to be seen what method it chooses.

In the past, there have been contradicting reports about Apple’s production plans. A report by Nikkey suggested that Apple “will likely miss its schedule for mass producing a more affordable iPhone”. The report cited a source with direct knowledge of the matter saying that the “suppliers are doing their best to produce and ship the [cheaper] iPhone within four weeks.” However, a a Bloomberg report said that the production of upcoming phone is on track without any delay. “The model is still on track to launch in March, though the plans are still fluid,” the Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter.

JAIPUR: With the passage of amendments in the Rajasthan Municipalities Act 2009 in the assembly on Wednesday, the government can declare no-construction zone in the UNESCO's declared world heritage site Walled City of Jaipur .

""While declaring Jaipur's Walled City as a heritage site, the UNESCO had asked to declare the area as no-construction zone. Now, Jaipur can be declared as a no-construction site,"" said Shanti Dhariwal, minister, urban development and housing department. The Section 194 of the Act has enabled the state to declare any site as the no-construction zone. The state had the power to declare the same under Rajasthan Municipalities Act of 1959 until it was declared in the amendment made in the Act in 2009. The amendment has been made in three sections of the Act. Dhariwal informed the assembly that as per the Jodhpur High Court zonal development plan should be made first followed by the master plan.

""Zonal plan is necessary to be made in localities which has a population over one lakh residents. With the amendment the local municipal bodies can make the zonal plan,"" said Dhariwal. The amendment says that it has increased the fine from Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000 for anyone violating rules under the act.

274,['5/03/2020'],Delhi riots have investors rethinking India's future,"'Diminished outlook'

Growth slowdown

NEW DELHI: Through its worst slowdown in more than a decade India has had a constant positive to show investors: political stability. That no longer holds true.Street protests and violence, which culminated in a riot that killed more than 46 in capital New Delhi during US president Donald Trump 's state visit, have raised concerns about whether investors may need to further temper expectations for Asia's third-largest economy.India was the world's fastest-growing major economy until about a year ago, when a slowdown took hold amid waning consumer demand, rural hardship and ballooning bad loans in the banking system. Yet, since his landslide re-election in May, critics say Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has prioritized measures that have stoked divisions between the Hindu majority and Muslims, triggering deadly protests that have started to hurt India's image among foreign investors.""There is disappointment with India and increasing caution among investors since the last election,"" said John Lau, Hong-Kong based head of Asian Equities at SEI, which has $352 billion under management. ""The recent political moves and laws have distracted the government from economic reforms."" Lau said the disruptions had led SEI to cut exposure to the South Asian nation to below benchmark levels. He's not the only one sounding caution.In February, as protesters blocked streets for the third straight month, WisdomTree Investments Inc., the US-based fund with $64 billion under management — said it is concerned rising political and social tensions will delay the country's economic recovery. Western Asset Management Co., the $453-billion investor and affiliate of Legg Mason Inc., said in January — less than a month after protests intensified — that it was reducing its Indian government bond holdings after tensions around a new citizenship law and the Kashmir region.""If the Indian government came up with greater direct incentives to invest in India — such as greater economic reforms or specific plans on FDI — then they would be less minded to focus on the racial tensions, but all else being equal, yes, I would imagine the violence is off-putting to investors,"" said Jim O'Neill, chairman at Chatham House, a London-based think-tank.Calls to the prime minister's office went unanswered while a spokesman from the office of finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman was not immediately available for comment.Since December, tens of thousands across India have been protesting a new religion-based law that fast-tracks citizenship for religious minorities from neighboring countries but excludes Muslims. Taken together with a plan for a national citizenship register, the new law is seen by critics as a way for Modi's Hindu nationalist government to discriminate against India's Muslim minority — a claim Modi has denied multiple times.The protests cement the view ""that India remains too fractured and unable to rise above domestic cleavages,"" Alyssa Ayres, who served as deputy assistant secretary of state for South Asia during the Obama administration and is now at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in an email. ""People do worry about social instability and its significant costs.""Home minister Amit Shah has blamed opposition parties for provoking crowds and spreading rumors. Modi tweeted an appeal for peace and harmony. Yet, resentments are deepening: members of Modi's party have called anti-government protesters ""traitors,"" and authorities failed to quickly rein in the Delhi violence. The riots started within days of the BJP's resounding loss in local elections in the city, the third straight defeat in state polls since May.""With key elections in the states of Assam and West Bengal looming next year, the government is likely to maintain focus on its controversial social agenda, risking more agitation,"" said Akhil Bery, Washington-based analyst at Eurasia Group in a February 28 note. Coupled with India's ""diminished outlook for economic reform,"" the group downgraded the country's short-term political trajectory to negative while remaining neutral on the long-term trajectory.Modi won his first landslide victory in 2014 on the promise of growth and 10 million jobs each year. But now the headlines are dominated by religious tensions and deadly protests.Although structural reforms started last summer raised hopes — tax cuts, opening up the country to more investment and privatizing industries — the economic slowdown took a turn for the worse this year. India's economy slowed to a more than six-year low in the final three months of last year to 4.7%, according to government data released Feb. 28. The government estimates 5% GDP growth for the fiscal year through March, an 11-year low.Rising religious tensions may make it easier for investors to turn their backs on India as the economy stutters, according to Simon Chauchard, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Leiden University.""Investors don't always care about regressive governments — Modi built a career as an economic genius on a riot,"" said Chauchard by phone from Amsterdam.""But investing in India remains difficult. The economy is doing badly and the mood is changing,"" said Chauchard. ""The narrative of Modi being a great economic reformer is dead — among the people who matter the tide might be changing.""A global economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus outbreak, which is now starting to affect India, is expected to further complicate recovery amid supply disruptions of everything from automobile components to pharmaceutical ingredients. So too will India's decision to raise trade barriers and its failure to complete an expected agreement with the USThe violence in Delhi during Trump's visit will have a lasting impact, according to Amitendu Palit, an economist specializing in international trade and investment at the National University of Singapore who has also worked for India's finance ministry. ""There will be reassessment, if not really a withdrawal of some investments,"" he said.

Most shops also said there was a shortage of hand sanitizer. According to the sources, various medical storekeepers in Rajamandi and Fuwara market on Wednesday took advance payment of Rs 200 to Rs 300 for providing N-95 mask on Thursday.President of the Agra chemist association Ashu Sharma said, “Reports of spread of coronavirus have created a panic situation among the citizens in the city.

276,['5/03/2020'],"In Delhi, BJP keeps distance from ‘coup bid’ in Madhya Pradesh","Police set up barricades outside the CM’s residence on Wednesday.

BHOPAL: The failed bid to topple the government has left the BJP red-faced, as two of its top leaders— former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and chief whip Narottam Mishra — were allegedly involved in the coup drama. Amid a lot of fingerpointing and accusations, the only solace for the two senior BJP leaders is that none of the MLAs who had gone missing spoke against them.

The party national leadership is maintaining a silence over the entire episode that unfolded for two days. However, BJP state in-charge and Rajya Sabha member Vinay Sahasrabuddhe termed the political upheaval as ‘drama due to Congress infighting’. He also clarified that Delhi was in no way involved in any such activity. ""The Congress is divided into three factions. If Digvijaya Singh gets Rajya Sabha ticket, Jyotiraditya Scindia will be unhappy. The entire drama was due to the internal feud in the Congress. The squabble is likely to throw interesting results,"" Sahasrabuddhe told TOI on Wednesday.

He, however, denied that he was in know of any such development in the Madhya Pradesh politics till it came to the fore through Congress leader Digvijaya Singh. ""We are not involved. This is a state issue and Delhi is not involved. Whatever is happening in the Congress theatre is being staged at Bhopal,"" he said.

Meanwhile, former chief minister Chouhan returned to Bhopal from New Delhi on Wednesday and later left for Agar Malwa to attend the party's mega worker convention. Sources said that after the Congress crisis was blown over, Chouhan along with state chief VD Sharma and organising general secretary Suhas Bhagat have been asked by the national leadership to visit New Delhi.

Reacting to ‘poaching’ allegations, Chouhan and his senior colleague Narottam Mishra said that the crisis has been created to exert pressure on the government and the leadership to exapand the ministry, as chief minister Kamal Nath has been repeatedly postponing the ministry rejig and appointment in various corporations.

But the questions are: What did the BJP gain from the political drama? What could be the reason behind the unsuccessful coup? Was it premature? Sources disclosed that the whole exercise was meant for Rajya Sabha elections, but it exploded ahead of March 26, the poll date. If this could have happened two days before the Rajya Sabha elections, the BJP could have gained sufficient number to wrest an additional seat, said sources.

After the failed drama, the BJP leadership has become cautious. They are also relieved that none of the ‘missing’ MLAs has spoken against the saffron party and its two senior leaders.

The fate of Chouhan and Mishra also depends on the outcome of Rajya Sabha elections. Chouhan, who has been supporting the new state chief VD Sharma in mobilising party workers is still hopeful for better results in the future.

NEW DELHI:As Delhi reported its second coronavirus case on Wednesday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal , his ministers, and other assembly members announced that they won’t celebrate Holi this year. They cited the violence in northeast Delhi, which left 47 dead and over 400 injured, as another reason for staying away from the celebrations.“I am not celebrating Holi this year due to two reasons. Many families are in distress due to the recent riots, and then there’s the spread of coronavirus. The cabinet ministers and our MLAs will also not celebrate Holi,” Kejriwal said. Urging Delhiites to avoid large gatherings and crowded places, he said, “Please wash hands frequently, and avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unclean hands.”Leader of the Opposition in Delhi assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri , said the BJP MLAs had unanimously decided not to participate in Holi events as a precaution against the virus. Expressing concern over “an assault on the social harmony and brotherhood,” Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari cited the communal violence as one of the reasons for the party not celebrating Holi in the capital.Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, “Experts across the world have advised to reduce mass gatherings to avoid the spread of Covid-19 novel coronavirus. Hence, this year I have decided not to participate in any Holi Milan programme.”Also, the Centre has decided that all government departments will consult the health ministry before organising conferences and international meets in the country in the coming days in the light of recommendations made by public health experts to avoid “big public gatherings”.When someone coughs or sneezes, they release small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth, which may contain virus. Doctors advise avoiding crowded places or public gathering because one can breathe in the droplets, including the Covid-19 virus, if the gathering has an infected individual.Symptoms of the novel coronavirus infection include fever, cough and breathlessness. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia or breathing difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. “The mortality rate of Covid-19 is about three per cent which is lesser than the novel coronavirus like SARS and MERS that have led to outbreaks in the past,” say experts.Maintaining hand hygiene and coughing etiquettes is one of the most effective measures to prevent the spread of the virus, doctors say.“Mask isn’t required to be worn by all. Only those with respiratory symptoms (coughing or sneezing) need to use it to protect others from getting the virus. If you use a mask, make sure to dispose it of properly,” said Dr Arun Guota, a paediatrician based in Northwest Delhi.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74486160,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-504858,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-all-delhi-mlas-to-skip-holi-you-should-avoid-crowded-places-too/articleshow/74485741.cms

283,['5/03/2020'],Retro wheels win Goan hearts,"Sahil Parsekar from Bastora, an automobile engineering student who is also a part time mechanic, got his first two-stroke bike as a gift in high school. He himself worked on restoring the 1996 model 100 cc bike and painted it red — and “it has been my identity” since then, he says. He now has three similar bikes and rides them over the weekend, taking them to vintage bike shows regularly. Like him, entrepreneur Rahul Chandran transported his first two-stroke bike on a train from Chhattisgarh four years ago. Today, he explores several parts on Goa over the weekends on his two-stroke bike and even joins rider groups during holidays. Like Sahil and Rahul, several bikers in Goa have their own reasons for collecting and riding two-stroke bikes, sometimes, bikes that are out of production now, like the RX 100s, RD 350s and Yezdis. The two-stroke bike lovers’ community in Goa is growing, with more and more enthusiasts getting together for weekend rides, and some even using their machines for regular commute. We ride around Goa to explore their love for the two-stroke engine.While some enthusiasts have found their bikes within Goa, some had to search further away from home. Sairaj Sawant found his bike in Sangli, Maharashtra. “Since I didn’t know how to get it to Goa, my friends pitched in ,” he says. He recounts how on a winter morning, they rode in an open jeep to get it to Goa. “It was 14 degrees, and we drove at 2 am. It was crazy, how we got it back on the jeep,” he saysVishvesh Kotkar, an entrepreneur, acquired his RD 350 a few years ago. “I started the restoration process in 2018 and took a few years to get it ready before I could ride it around Diwali 2019. I got it done from Pune. There were just around 7000 bikes that were sold before it was discontinued in the 1980s, and there are very few which are still in working condition. The bike is 37 years old, and it works fine now. By the time my son is in college, the bike will be an amazing vintage bike for him!” he says.Rahul remembers how he couldn’t find the bike he wanted in Goa, but luck smiled on him when his cousin spotted a bike in Chhattisgarh “I took the bike to Kerala by train and then got it to Margao on another train,” he says. Shirish Naik from Taleigao who owns two Lambrettas, a 1973 and 1978 model says, “When I was younger, my neighbour used to have a two-stroke scooter. I was fascinated and wanted one of my own. I got mine six years back. I had restored it for a friend, but he gifted it to me instead. It’s very simple to restore these bikes once you understand the mechanism.”Aldrin Rebello from Chinchinim, who has restored his bikes by himself, says, “I have grown up in a family where several people rode the RX. I got my first one in 2013 but after that I realised that one is never enough. I have three right now. It does get difficult to maintain, and spares are sold at premium prices now. It is also difficult to find spares. I got my bike in a very bad condition and restored it myself, with some help from a mechanic,” says Aldrin. He now owns three two-stroke bikes.Some spend months working on restoring their bikes by themselves, while some get it done from a mechanic. Rahul says, “I dismantled the whole bike and listed the spares that I will require for the mechanical, electrical and other work. Then I started looking for spares in other states and calling people who deal in this, since most stores don’t stock these. I found a mechanic in Panaji who helped me restore it.” Vishvesh, who got his bike in scrap condition, knew someone in Pune who restores bikes. “It took a lot of patience, time and money to get it in working condition finally,” he says. Vinay Chari, from Porvorim, has been riding his RX Z for five years now. “I got it in scrap, and a friend of mine and I got together to restore it,” he adds.Some biking enthusiasts, despite not being professionals, help their friends restore their vintage bikes as well. Shirish also restores bikes for others in Goa. “Several people in Goa are now interested in restoring vintage bikes! They love riding it. Spares are reasonably priced, so it fits people's budgets. You require around `40,000-`50,000 to restore a Lambretta. And if you try to buy a restored bike, it would be anywhere between `1,00,000-`1,50,000. There are a few people who buy these, but most people prefer restoring their bike themselves.” Sahil first got a 1996 model RX100 as a gift, which he restored himself. “I restore and repair bikes for others as well, now,” he says. He currently has three RX 100s.For two-stroke lovers, these aren’t just trophy bikes. They ride it over the weekend, travel outside the state on it or even go on adventure trails. Some of them even use it for regular commute. “I used to ride it to office, and use it for regular commute too. I have done the Mumbai-Pune and Goa-Belgaum routes on my bike,” says Aldrin. Sahil used to ride them regularly earlier, but now uses them for weekend rides with friends, apart from attending vintage bike shows. Rahul typically takes his bike out on Sundays, while Vinay likes the ghat roads for his rides with friends.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74486230,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-2802823/74486230.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/retro-wheels-win-goan-hearts/articleshow/74486233.cms

UDAIPUR: The Banswara police on Wednesday unearthed a fake arms licence scam that was going on in connivance with the kingpin, a junior clerk of the judicial section of the sub district office (SDM) at Garhi block of the district. The accused clerk Prakash Bhoi has been arrested, while few others have been detained.

Police have recovered 38 muskets (topidar bandook) that had been purchased through fake licences allegedly issued by the clerk and his accomplices.

The clerk had allegedly forged signatures of IAS Pooja Parth when she was on probation as SDM Garhi, Prabhu dayal Sharma and the present officer, the police said. A detailed investigation is underway.

""The accused clerk Prakash Bhoi had issued over 100 fake firearm licences from 2018 onwards till day to different persons, he forged signatures of the SDMs and had made fake seals of their names to create fake licenses,"" Banswara SP Kesar Singh told TOI.

The matter came to light when the gunseller from Udaipur observed a sudden rise in musket sales in Banswara district and when he went through the documents, he found that the licenses had been issued despite containing some discrepancies.

Feeling something fishy, he informed about it to SDM Garhi Ramchandra Khateek who was surprised to know about the licenses since no single muzzle loaded gun licenses had been issued since 2013 from the SDM office. The SDM reported the matter to collector and SP and an FIR was given by him.

MUMBAI: CAC chief Madan Lal and his colleagues took a couple of key factors into account before finalizing the names of Sunil Joshi and Harvinder Singh as selectors.

The CAC, Lal admitted, was conscious of picking selectors who can deal with a skipper with a dominating personality like Virat Kohli .

""We had this (Virat) factor the most in our mind,"" Lal said, before his younger colleague in the panel, RP Singh threw more light on this critical issue. ""Our captain is a high-performing player. We have kept it in mind that we find somebody who can communicate well with him, because in the end it is the captain who has to run the team. The captain matters a lot to the team and so it is important on how you communicate with him. What is gone is in the past, the two selectors that we picked had the best answers on this topic,"" he explained.

Regarding the Dhoni issue, a source in the BCCI told TOI: ""The CAC asked the candidates whether they would pick Dhoni if he had a good IPL , even though he hasn't played domestic cricket for the last 7-8 months. Also, how would they communicate with a legend like him, especially if he is not picked. Joshi said that if MSD had a good IPL, he would be considered.""

The candidates were also asked about another burning issue. ""The CAC also asked the candidates whether they would straight away pick players coming off an injury for India, or ask them to play a first-class match, prove their fitness and then come back into the team,"" said the source.

The home department has sent a communication, signed by deputy secretary Shirish Mohod , to the state director-general of police as well as the state’s chief standing counsel in the Supreme Court.

TOI has a copy of the communication.The letter, issued on Tuesday, cites Supreme Court directives issued on January 24.

Later, based on the directives of the director-general of police, the probe was handed over to the state Crime Investigation Department on August 9, 2017.

“Considering the scale and scope of the scam...it is essential to carry out an indepth probe. A report has been sought from the state director-general of police on the formation of a special investigation team,” reads the letter.

Gutte, who was arrested on March 26, 2019, had contested and won the assembly elections that year from Gangakhed as a Rashtriya Samaj Paksh (RSP) nominee. RSP is a BJP and RPI (A) ally in the state. Former MLA Madhusudan Kendre , who has been following up on the case, said, “Gutte and his aides used 7/12 extracts of about 30,000 farmers, including those deceased, to obtain crop loans running into hundreds of crores.”

However Iran's Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said a cut of ""at least... around half a million barrels"" was necessary to stabilise the market.Saudi Arabia is also a supporter of further cuts, with Riyadh even thought to be amenable to a cut in the order of a million barrels per day.But Russia may be harder to convince on this score, with Russian President Vladimir Putin being quoted on Sunday as saying the current market price was ""acceptable"" and above the level foreseen in Russian economic planning.Russia's RIA Novosti agency reported Wednesday that Moscow's delegation was proposing an extension of the existing deal with no fresh cuts.Aside from bridging their differences on the effect of the virus on the market, the assembled diplomats are also having to accommodate changes to their routines in Vienna.Two medical workers were on hand to screen the temperatures of all those entering OPEC headquarters on Wednesday.OPEC's Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo and Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak were seen in a video tweeted by the organisation attempting a ""footshake"", gently bumping the sides of their feet together in a more hygienic alternative to a handshake.The cartel has also taken the extraordinary step of barring access to its headquarters for the media due to the ""risk that would come from convening such a vast number of people in one place"".Livestreams of the beginning of meetings will instead be made available to journalists at a press centre assembled in a nearby hotel.In a statement on Tuesday OPEC said it was following UN guidelines for such meetings and planned to ""shorten the format of such gatherings, limit the number of participants and cancel any related side-events"".",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74486321,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-241230,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/opec-divided-on-how-to-combat-coronavirus-fallout/articleshow/74486261.cms

297,['5/03/2020'],Coronavirus in Hong Kong: First human-to-animal infection: Pet dog infected with COVID-19 in Hong Kong,"HONG KONG: The pet dog of a coronavirus patient in Hong Kong was confirmed to be infected with the disease, in a likely case of human-to-animal transmission, authorities said on Wednesday.

The canine, which belongs to a 60-year-old woman patient, had repeatedly tested ""weak positive"" for the new coronavirus since Friday, when it was quarantined at an animal centre.

The city's Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said repeated tests suggest the dog -- a pomeranian -- has ""a low-level of infection"".

The AFCD said experts from universities and the World Organisation for Animal Health have unanimously agreed that ""it is likely to be a case of human-to-animal transmission"".

The pomeranian has not shown any novel coronavirus symptoms, it said.

New measures put in place by Hong Kong's government last Friday mean all pets infected with the coronavirus must be quarantined for 14 days. Two dogs are already in isolation.

The other dog in quarantine belongs to a second coronavirus patient that tested negative for the virus once and will be tested again before its release.

Authorities said they will continue to closely monitor the pomeranian and return it to its owner when it tests negative for the disease.

""Apart from maintaining good hygiene practices, pet owners need not be overly concerned and under no circumstances should they abandon their pets,"" an AFCD spokesman said.

The financial hub has confirmed 104 cases of the new coronavirus in humans, with two deaths earlier this month.

298,['5/03/2020'],Chennai: Nandambakkam to get piped water supply soon,"Water will be supplied from the Chembarambakkam Lake (in photo) and Veeranam lake

CHENNAI: Residents of Nandambakkam are likely to receive piped water soon. Metrowater has laid pipelines in the locality.

Metrowater executive director T Prabhu Shankar told TOI that the area was a ""small residential pocket with a few shops"". ""Residents will get water from Veeranam and Chembarambakkam reservoirs. A total of 1.5 million litres of water will be supplied to 1,000 households in the area a day,"" he said.

Metrowater laid pipelines along 9km, Shankar said. Residents will have to lay a pipe from the supply line on the road to their houses. ""For this they need not pay any amount to Metrowater. Once this is done, they will get supply,"" he said.

Work on laying pipes in the locality began in February 2014 and was completed within four years.

By August 2018, trial runs were conducted to check for leaks. ""Once the leaks were identified and plugged, the pipelines were ready to carry water to the households. However, the connections could not be effected last year as the city faced a severe water scarcity between March and July. So the completed work was not publicised by the authorities,"" a Metrowater official said.

Metrowater is slowly expanding its supply network to areas added to the Chennai corporation limits. In order to cater to the increasing demand, a new 450MLD (millionn litres a day) desalination plant is being set up at Karikkattukkuppam near Vadanemmeli.

BENGALURU: Since retiring from all forms of cricket in 2012, former India spinner Sunil Joshi has worn many hats - mentor, coach and commentator. He added another on Wednesday when he was named as chairman of the senior national selection committee by the Madan Lal-led Cricket Advisory Committee.

Joshi, who made his Test debut against England in Birmingham on his 26th birthday in 1996, made 15 (41 wickets) Test appearances and featured in 69 One-Dayers (69 wickets). His international career that lasted between 1996 and 2001 is best remembered for his figures of 5 for 6 in India's eight-wicket win over South Africa in Nairobi in September 1999.

Over the years, Joshi has been an inspiration to mofussil talent with his journey from Gadag in north Karnataka well documented. The wily left-arm spinner last turned out in India colours in an ODI against Australia in 2001. However, he continued to be a domestic warhorse with 615 wickets and 5129 runs from 160 first-class matches for Karnataka. He captained Karnataka to the1998-99 Ranji Trophy triumph as well. Joshi's tryst with coaching began in the 2011-12 season when he was surprisingly named as Hyderabad coach, even before he had announced retirement as a player. He marshalled the team into the Ranji Trophy quarterfinals that year. Since then, Joshi's profile has expanded, having coached in Oman, USA and Bangladesh, for whom he was the spin consultant until the World Cup last year.

On the domestic front, he has been with various teams including Jammu and Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh this season. He was named as the spin bowling coach of IPL franchise Kings XI Punjab for the forthcoming season. Now with the BCCI role, he will have to forgo the IPL assignment.

""It's an honour and privilege to serve my beloved country in a new role. I'm grateful to the CAC led by chairman Madan Lal and members RP Singh and Sulakshana Naik for the faith and confidence they have shown in me. I look forward to the new challenge with commitment and conviction,"" said the 49-year-old.

Joshi's recommendation did come as a surprise to many, especially since his former teammate and pacer Venkatesh Prasad was touted as a frontrunner for the post. Congratulating Joshi, Prasad, the former chairman of the junior selection committee said: ""I applied for the post because I believe I have the credentials. It was up to the CAC to pick the candidate they thought was best suited. I extend my heartiest congratulations to Sunil and wish him the very best for the new role.""

300,['5/03/2020'],South Africa vs Australia: Magnificent Malan guides South Africa to series win against Australia,"South Africa batsman Janneman Malan celebrating his century (AP Photo)

Opener Janneman Malan struck a sparkling unbeaten century to guide South Africa to a six-wicket win over Australia in the second one-day international in Bloemfontein on Wednesday, which sealed victory in the series.

SCORECARD

Australia won the toss and chose to bat, posting 271 all out as South Africa seamer Lungi Ngidi completed career-best figures of 6-58 on a slow wicket to halt what had been an electric start from the visitors.

Malan, who was out to the first ball of the match on debut on Saturday, anchored the South African reply, taming his usual swashbuckling style to score 129 not out from 139 balls and lead the home side to victory with nine balls to spare.

""Janneman read the situation really well and paced it beautifully to set up the win,"" South Africa captain Quinton de Kock said at the post-match presentation.

""It’s also great having Lungi bowling like this, he is really sticking up his hand and leading the bowling attack. We mustn’t take out foot off the gas now, we owe ourselves another win.""

Australia made a fast start to their innings, racing to 50 in the seventh over before David Warner (35) became the first victim for Ngidi, who later dismissed Steve Smith (13) and Marnus Labuschagne in consecutive balls.

Aaron Finch (69) looked fluent in the early part of his innings, but when South Africa strangled his scoring areas, he edged Anrich Nortje to wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock trying a flamboyant drive.

D'Arcy Short (69) put on 66 for the fifth wicket with Mitchell Marsh (36), and when they fell, Ngidi returned to mop up the lower order as Australia added only 49 runs for the loss of six wickets in the final 10 overs.

South Africa lost key batsman De Kock for naught to the third ball of their reply, but Malan, who has not been selected for South Africa’s ODI tour of India later this month, and JJ Smuts (41) put on a patient 91 in 20.1 overs.

In-form Heinrich Klaasen added a run-a-ball 51 that provided momentum when it was needed, and David Miller (37 not out from 29 balls) joined Malan to finish off a record chase in ODIs at the Mangaung Oval as the hosts reached 274 for four in 48.3 overs.

""We were 20 or 30 runs short with the bat,"" Finch said. ""We should have got more, our bowlers tried hard but the South Africans played well through that middle period. Klaasen’s innings changed the momentum.

""We lost our way (with the bat), we need to learn, we keep making the same mistakes. We need to improve.""

South Africa lead the series 2-0 and have now beaten Australia in 10 of their last 11 ODI meetings. The third and final match is in Potchefstroom on Saturday.

Jalota, an IAS officer of the 1988 batch who was GST commissioner for well over five years, was shifted to the rural development department. He did not join it, though, following which Arvind Kumar was posted in his place on January 17. Since then, Jalota is on compulsory waiting.

Another high profile officer on compulsory waiting is Ashwini Bhide, who headed the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation . She was relieved of the charge on January 22. An IAS officer of the 1995 batch, Bhide was locked in a controversy over cutting of trees for the metro car shed at Aarey. Both Uddhav and Aaditya Thackeray had raised concerns over largescale axing of trees.

Chief protocol officer Nand Kumar (1989), who has been replaced by Manisha Patankar, is waiting too.

The CM’s principal secretary, Bhushan Gagrani, an IAS officer of the 1990 batch, too, is on compulsory waiting. An IAS officer of the 1991 batch, Shyam Tagde , proceeded on leave after he was shifted from the minority welfare department to textiles. Tourism secretary Vinita Ved-Singhal (1996) is on compulsory waiting too.

Former chief elector officer and additional chief secretary Ashwani Kumar, an IAS officer of the 1987 batch, proceeded on leave on July 7, 2019, after being abruptly shunted out by the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis . The new government is yet to give him a new assignment. Marathi language secretary Atul Patne, an IAS officer of the 1999 batch, is on compulsory waiting.

Significantly, while several bureaucrats are waiting for new posts, additional chief secretaries Manoj Saunik and Sanjay Kumar, and principal secretaries I S Chahal and Ashish Kumar Singh hold additional charges of sensitive departments. Saunik looks after public works and finance while Sanjay Kumar looks after housing and home. Ashish Kumar is transport secretary as well as secretary to the CM while Chahal is the new urban development secretary and continues to lead water resources department.

A senior bureaucrat said, “We expect to grant new postings within a week or after the ongoing budget session. We have noticed a new trend with every bureaucrat insisting on choice posting. If they do not get it, they knock at the doors of politicians or proceed on leave.” A bureaucrat said, “Thackeray should bring out a policy so every bureaucrat gets an opportunity to work in infrastructure as well as social sectors. Transfers should not be a monthly affair.”

305,['5/03/2020'],Coronavirus: Why Wuhan evacuees at Delhi camp are a nervous lot,"NEW DELHI: There was panic at the Indo-Tibetan Border Police ( ITBP ) quarantine camp at Delhi’s Chhawla on Wednesday after 14 Italians and one Indian — who were admitted to the facility a day earlier — tested positive for coronavirus The other residents, who had returned from China’s Wuhan on the third evacuation flight on February 27, said they had used common spaces in the building like the staircase, a game room and a mess on the ground floor until Tuesday which could have exposed them to the virus.At present, 112 people — 76 Indians and 36 foreigners — are living in the first, second and fifth floor of the building. On Tuesday, 21 Italian tourists and three Indian tour operators had arrived at the quarantine facility and were moved to the third floor. Throughout the day, nervous residents kept approaching ITBP at the camp, asking them to shift the Italians to a hospital immediately.“We were allowed to use the ground floor since all of us had been cleared in the last test. But yesterday we heard on loudspeakers that no one was to step out of the room. People saw some ambulances too so we knew something was going on. But it was only on Wednesday morning that we learned that an Italian group had tested positive. We demanded that either them or us should be shifted,” said one of the residents.Those who tested positive for the virus were shifted from the building in the evening, ITBP DIG Vivek Pandey confirmed to TOI. He said, “Due procedure was followed and there was no contact between the Italian group which was brought in yesterday and all others. We have been following all safety measures.” A source in ITBP said that the Italians and an Indian who tested positive had been taken to a hospital while few others were sent to the embassy.Many residents, though, questioned why it took several hours for the authorities to shift those who tested positive. “This is supposed to be a quarantine facility. Confirmed cases should have been shifted immediately,” said a resident. A quarantine facility is to restrict the movement of people who might have been exposed to an infection but who aren’t yet sick. Those with confirmed infections are kept in isolation.Dr Shalabh Dass, a physician at Jag Parvesh Chandra Hospital, a government-run facility in Delhi, said the risk of infection depends on several factors. “Was there any person-to-person contact with a patient? If yes, then for how long? Also, one’s immunity plays a role and whether people took any precautions like regular use of sanitisers.”But apprehensions remain.

306,['5/03/2020'],Coronavirus wipes $50 billion off global exports in February alone,"UNITED NATIONS: UN economists announced a likely $50 billion drop in the worldwide manufacturing exports in February alone as the extent of the damage to the global economy caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) moved further into focus.Citing the China Manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI), Pamela Coke-Hamilton, who heads UNCTAD's Division on International Trade and Commodities, said that it had fallen to 37.5 - a drop of about 20 points – the lowest reading since 2004.“This also correlates directly to exports and also implies a two per cent drop in overall exports,” she said, with a resulting “ripple effect” worldwide “to the tune of a USD 50 billion fall in exports.”Because China has become the main supplier of finished products and so-called “intermediate” products used in countless industries - from chemical for pharmaceuticals to parts for digital cameras and the car industry - concerns about the long-term disruption to supply chains there, has left many companies around the world “fearful” that their own output may soon be affected, UNCTAD said.“Of course, if the virus continues to spread and gets out of control, and we see closures not only in China but also in India and the United States and everywhere else in the world, then it would be a big problem,” said Alessandro Nicita from UNCTAD's Division on International Trade and Commodities.“Ultimately, the economic impact of this virus depends on the measures that countries apply to contain the virus. So, China has done a great job in containing the virus, but it has sacrificed a little bit the economy, at least in the first few weeks. So, planned closures, restriction to movement of people, which were all necessary; but there is an economic effect when you take those measures.”In addition to the falling manufacturing levels, UNCTAD also highlighted a decrease in the number of container ships leaving Shanghai in the first half of February (from around 300 a week to 180), which then returned to normal levels in the second half of the month.“Right now, the impact on the global value chains is already being felt and will continue probably for a few months,” Coke-Hamilton said.“But if it rebounds, say in the next few months, then the long-term or year-long impact will be a little different and will be better. So, it depends on what happens in China.”In remarks made at a joint press conference with the head of the World Bank Group , the IMF Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, said that the UN-backed global funds would make up the shortfall, in effect, by offering to inject around $50 billion into low-income and emerging market nations, pending requests for support.""Thanks to the generosity of our shareholders, we have about $1 trillion in overall lending capacity,” she said.""For low-income countries, we have rapid-disbursing emergency financing of up to $10 billion (50 per cent of quota of eligible members) that can be accessed without a full-fledged IMF programme,” she added.The IMF chief added that members can access emergency financing through the Rapid Financing Instrument.""This facility could provide about $40 billion for emerging markets that could potentially approach us for financial support. We also have the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust – the CCRT – which provides eligible countries with up-front grants for relief on IMF debt service falling due.""The CCRT proved to be effective during the 2014 Ebola outbreak, but is now underfunded with just over $200 million available against possible needs of over $1 billion.""She called on member countries ""to help ensure that this facility is fully re-charged and ready for the current crisis"", and said that the Fund was ""fully committed to supporting our member countries, particularly the most vulnerable. We have the tools to help and we are coordinating closely with our partner institutions.”",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/coronavirus-wipes-50-billion-off-global-exports-in-february-alone/articleshow/74486323.cms

308,['5/03/2020'],Ulwe murder: Shooter used car with fake number plate,"Representative image

NAVI MUMBAI: The accused in the Ulwe murder case used a duplicate registration number on the car he used as he waited for his victim, Prabhawati Bhagat , 55, outside Maharashtra Bank in Sector-19, Ulwe, on Monday afternoon.

The police realized they had been misled after they tracked the car owner using the registration number. The owner turned out to be a professor at Kharghar. He was summoned to NRI coastal police station on Tuesday and his statement was recorded. He claims his vehicle’s registration number has been duplicated and misused by the accused.

Prabhawati and her husband, Balkrishna Bhagat (62), had driven to the bank in their Maruti Swift car. She waited in the parked car, while he went to the bank.

A police source said, “CCTV cameras installed at a shop in the locality had captured the accused’s car. There is no CCTV surveillance on the street near the spot from where Bhagat was driven away in her car by the accused, who shot her dead and abandoned the vehicle about 1.5 km away, in sector-23.”

The source said either the accused is using another duplicate vehicle registration number or he has hidden the car.

“We have some clues about the car and CCTV footage of all toll plazas in Navi Mumbai, Raigad and Mumbai are being scanned. A huge police force in both the zones is working round the clock,” the source said.

A police officer with information about the case said, “Teams from the crime branch and local police stations have got vital leads about the accused through human intelligence and by scanning CCTV footage from Bhagat’s house in Shelghar village near Ulwe.”

CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu government on Wednesday reached out to Andhra Pradesh urging it to sustain the supply of Krishna water - about 2tmcft - until April. Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami requested Andhra Pradesh C M Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy to take part in a meeting for inter-linking of Cauvery-Godavari rivers.

A delegation led by senior ministers S P Velumani and D Jayakumar called on Jagan Mohan Reddy in Vijayawada and made the request on behalf of Palaniswami. ""The delegation submitted the letter from TN chief minister thanking his AP counterpart for heeding to the request and ensured continuous water supply since last year,"" said a source.

Sources said the Andhra Pradesh government has assured the quantum required by Tamil Nadu to meet the drinking water requirements of Chennai. In August last year, Jagan Mohan Reddy responded positively to the TN government's request and told authorities to divert floodwater of Srisailam to Chennai, which was reeling under the worst drinking water crisis. The EPS government had to ferry water by train from Jolarpet for about four months, paying 8.6 lakh a trip.

""While the agreement between Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh is to supply 12tmcft a year, the state never realized the supply during any water year. This time, the concerted efforts of the state government had the neighbour supplying 6tmcft until Monday with inflow of 259 cusecs. The supply continues,"" said a senior official.

As on Monday, the combined storage of all four reservoirs, Poondi, Cholavaram, Red Hills and Chembarambakkam, stood at 6.174tmcft, which is 49% of their total storage capacity.

When counsel Karuna Nundy sought to argue Mander's PIL seeking registration of FIRs against BJP members who allegedly raised "" desh ke gaddaron ko ..."" slogans to whip up communal frenzy, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the activist himself was guilty of hate speech at Jamia Millia Islamia on December 16.

""Mander is heard inciting people to go for justice on the street. We have videos to show it to the court,"" Mehta told a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant. The bench asked Mehta to file an affidavit authenticating his charge against Mander and asked Nundy to respond. ""Till this is sorted out, we will not hear you (Mander),"" the bench observed.

Delhi Police filed an affidavit seeking dismissal of Mander's petition with exemplary cost. It cited his freely available speech. The court kept Mander's petition for hearing on Friday, brushing aside a request for a longer adjournment as he would return from a foreign trip only on Sunday. The SG said, ""He has left for the US after creating all this ruckus.""

Mehta claimed the videos showed Mander saying, ""We have seen in NRC , Ayodhya and Kashmir, the Supreme Court has not protected insaniyat (humanity), samanata (equality) or secularism. What will be the future course for this country will not be decided in Parliament or Supreme Court. It will be decided on the street.""

Mehta also claimed Mander had said, ""Muslims here are Indians by choice. We (the Hindus) are Indian by chance. We had no choice. Muslims had the choice."" The CJI-led bench told Nundy to ""look into the alleged speeches and respond"".

The SG also drew the court's attention to Mander earlier seeking recusal of then CJI Ranjan Gogoi , casting doubts on his impartiality, in an NRC matter. The court had struck off Mander's name from the petition and substituted it with the SC Legal Services Authority.

While hearing the petition, a Justice Gogoi-led bench had sought answers from the Assam government on whereabouts of 99,000-odd illegal immigrants who had not been located after tribunals declared them foreigners. It criticised the government's proposal to release them on bail on furnishing a bond of Rs 5 lakh if they had been detained for five years.

On May 2 last year, Mander had argued in person and based his perception of bias on the basis of social media reports to say that the CJI's observations were opposite to what his petition demanded - protection of human rights of illegal migrants who under international law should be released after a maximum six-month detention.

The bench of Justices Gogoi and Deepak Gupta had said, ""If the court agrees with you, then it is okay. If it does not, then it is biased. This is not acceptable.""

323,['5/03/2020'],MahaRERA: Buyers to decide fate of incomplete projects,"Representative image

MahaRERA has pulled up 984 developers, mostly from the city, Mumbai and Thane, for not completing projects within the deadline and seeking an extension from the real estate regulatory authority .

The Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRERA) has called these developers for suo motu hearings in April. The hearings will involve both the developers and consumers, who have invested in their projects. The consumers will have the powers to remove a developer by revoking project registration.

“Fifty-one per cent of the consumers in a project can form an association of allottees and, during the hearings, agree on giving the developer more time. The suo motu hearings are held to protect the consumers’ interests and ensure early completion of the projects,” a MahaRERA official said.

“Once this is done, an existing developer can be allowed to complete the project within a specific time and after payment of fees as prescribed under the (deadline) extension rules,” the official added. “In the entire process, the association of the allottees/society/cooperative society/ federation or any other body, consisting of a majority of the allottees who have booked plots or apartments or buildings, in the project would decide whether they will favour an extension or exit the project,” the official said.

The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, (RERA), mandates that a developer can apply for the first extension on failing a deadline. For further extension, MahaRERA has to hear the flat buyers before deciding whether to grant the extension or allow the allottees’ association take over and complete the project.

The promoters, who have failed to meet the deadline after the first extension, would not be able to sell or advertise any of their projects. On the other hand, consumers would not be able to register their properties because the RERA registration would lapse.

MahaRERA currently has 24,643 projects registered across the state. Of these, 7,666 projects in the state are in the “totally completed” category. Developers of 828 projects have sought deadline extension. Shirish Deshpande , chairperson of consumer forum Mumbai Grahak Panchayat, said MahaRERA had the power to initiate a suo motu investigation in case of any violation of RERA provisions.

“In case a promoter has failed or neglected to renew the MahaRERA registration, he or she can be summoned by the regulatory authority suo motu. It will be fair and appropriate to also call the association of allottees for such hearings,” he added.

324,['5/03/2020'],"Rahul Gandhi: President of Indian National Congress Rahul Gandhi visits Delhi riot-hit area, says hate won't help India","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi visited riot-affected Brijpuri on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: Around 10 days after communal violence took a toll of 47 lives and left hundreds injured in northeast Delhi, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi visited riot-affected Brijpuri on Wednesday. Among others, he visited a school owned by a former Congress MLA that had been torched by rioters.

""Hate and violence are the enemies of development and division and burning of India will not benefit Bharat Mata,"" Gandhi said while interacting with the media at Arun Modern Public Senior Secondary School, owned by former Congress MLA Bheeshma Sharma. The Congress group inspected the scorched classrooms and saw the school buses that had been burnt down.

The bus carrying the Congress delegation stopped near the school, the area around which had turned into a fortress with multiple security rings in place to make sure there was no untoward incident during the visit of the Congress leader. Police and security personnel were deployed in and around the area to keep vigil when Gandhi was in the area, which was one of the localities most affected by the communal turmoil and had faced the brunt of vandalism, arson, gun use and stone-pelting last week.

""This school is the future of India. Violence and hate burnt it down. This has benefitted none,"" Gandhi said.

Two separate delegations - one led by Gandhi and the other comprising mostly Congress MPs - visited different areas in northeast Delhi. Accompanying Gandhi were K C Venugopal, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Mukul Wasnik, Kumari Selja, Gaurav Gogoi , Randeep Surjewala and K Suresh.

At the school, Gandhi also said, ""Violence in India and its capital damages the global reputation of the country. Brotherhood, love and unity are our strengths and these have been hit in this place. Such politics does not only damage a school, but also India and Bharat Mata. The reputation which is needed for the future has been reduced to ashes.""

The group also visited Brijpuri Masjid near the school that was vandalised during the frenzy. Some Congress functionaries with a gaggle of locals were present near the school to receive the former party president. Gandhi wrapped up his visit in around 30 minutes. A Congress delegation had visited the areas days before the Gandhi's Wednesday tour.

Mohammad Fakhruddin of Brijpuri Masjid told TOI , ""Rahul Gandhi keenly listened to the narrative of the violence that overtook the mosque on February 26. A madrassa in the vicinity of the masjid was also vandalised. An irreparable damage was caused to the two buildings."" Fakhruddin said that the Congress leader promised to send another delegation to take stock of the damage in detail.

The other Congress delegation comprised of MPs who left for northeast Delhi in a bus from Kerala House . The There, the delegation interacted with shopkeepers whose establishment had been affect by the violence.

KOCHI: The district administration would be convening a meeting of officials and elected members of local bodies to explore the possibilities of expanding decentralized waste treatment projects in the district on Friday.

The meeting would consider entrusting workers of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme and Ayyankali Employment Guarantee Scheme with the job of collecting biodegradable and bio-nondegradable waste.

As part of expanding decentralized waste treatment to more areas, units of pit compost, bio-compost, pipe compost and ring compost units will be allotted to households. Plans are on the anvil for setting up a storage facility at ward-levels for collecting garbage.

District administration asked all the members of district panchayat, chairpersons and secretaries of corporation and municipalities, presidents and secretaries of block panchayats and grama panchayats to attend the meeting.

At a time when the district administration is planning to expand decentralized waste treatment, Kochi Corporation authorities have been turning a blind eye to it. At the council meeting held on Tuesday, some of the councillors challenged the corporation authorities' stand against decentralized waste treatment projects.

The corporation council held in July had given its approval for supplying garbage to a private firm which, in association with Kochi Metro , has been engaged in beautification of Metro medians. Despite the corporation council's decision, corporation authorities failed to supply the garbage to the company.

LONDON: Manchester City won a 20th consecutive domestic cup tie to move into the quarter-finals of the FA Cup with a 1-0 win at Sheffield Wednesday as Tottenham crashed out on penalties to Norwich.

Sergio Aguero scored the only goal for the holders eight minutes into the second half as Wednesday goalkeeper Joe Wildsmith failed to get a strong enough hand to the Argentine's low strike.

A solitary goal was scant reward for the dominance of Pep Guardiola's men as the Catalan was rewarded for naming a strong line-up against the Championship side.

Riyad Mahrez and Gabriel Jesus missed glorious first half chances, while Nicolas Otamendi and Benjamin Mendy hit the woodwork before Aguero finally made the breakthrough.

Despite failing to add to their tally, City maintained hopes of a cup treble after lifting a third consecutive League Cup on Sunday and beating Real Madrid 2-1 in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie.

""He is a good manager and crazy,"" said Aguero of Guardiola's relentless demand to keep winning.

City will travel to Newcastle in the quarter-finals.

Norwich will host Derby or Manchester United in their first quarter-final since 1992 after seeing off Spurs 3-2 on penalties after a 1-1 draw.

A bad night for Tottenham, who have now lost their last four games in all competitions, was compounded when midfielder Eric Dier climbed into the stands to confront supporters who had allegedly insulted members of his family.

""I think Eric did what we as professionals cannot do but when someone insults you and your family is involved, especially your younger brother,"" said Spurs boss Jose Mourinho.

""This person insulted Eric, the younger brother was not happy with the situation and Eric was not happy. But we as professionals cannot do what he did.""

Jan Vertonghen headed Tottenham into an early lead, but Mourinho's decision to hand 36-year-old goalkeeper Michel Vorm his first appearance of the season backfired.

The Dutchman spilled a long-range effort from Kenny McLean and Josip Drmic bundled home the rebound to level.

Both sides then tired badly in extra-time, but neither could find a winner and saves from Tim Krul to deny Troy Parrott and Gedson Fernandes allied to Erik Lamela's wild attempt that flew over the bar saw another shot at a trophy for Spurs slip by.

Mourinho again blamed the absence of key personnel such as Harry Kane and Son Heung-min to injury for defeat.

""Some of my players were really in trouble and they made an incredible effort to try,"" said Mourinho.

""I don't have one single negative feeling towards my players. I can cope with negative moments in football , but I feel really sorry for my players.""

Leicester also booked their place in the last eight with a much-needed 1-0 win over Birmingham thanks to Ricardo Pereira's late header.

The Foxes have won just one of their last seven Premier League games to stall their charge towards the Champions League next season.

Brendan Rodgers' men were again without Jamie Vardy through injury and needed right-back Ricardo to get the only goal when he headed home Marc Albrighton's cross eight minutes from time.

""I thought it was just a matter of time,"" said Rodgers, whose side will host Chelsea in the quarter-finals.

""In the second half we dominated -- lots of quick combos and the goal was coming. It was an excellent display.""

Sheffield United will host Arsenal in the other quarter-final tie.

Along with his son Rajashekar, the MP borrowed a loan to the tune of 17.28 crore from the bank, in collusion with Thiagarajan in 2013.Though the duo took the loan for construction of a new campus for the educational institution, it was found that the funds were diverted and utilised for several other purposes.As the account became irregular and interests remained unpaid, the bank initiated an internal investigation and found the manager at fault for providing loans to the father-son duo. A case was registered with the anti- corruption bureau (ACB) of the CBI in 2016.The three were charged for offences under Sections 120 B of the Indian Penal Code, read with Section 11 of Prevention of Corruption Act and Section 13(2) read with 13(1)(d) of said Act.During the trial, the duo and the bank manager submitted that they were not at fault and the entire transaction was carried legally. Opposing their submissions, CBI special public prosecutor contended that electronic evidences were available for the transactions between Rajashekar and the bank manager in 2013 in booking tickets and hotel rooms abroad for 2.53 lakh.Recording the submissions, the court observed that the elected representative should serve the public rather than collude with officials and get involved in fraudulent activities.The judge also noted that corruption in the country ""has to be controlled with iron hands"".",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74487684,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-444142,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ex-mp-of-aiadmk-son-get-7-year-jail/articleshow/74486628.cms

MUMBAI: Among several issues discussed by police commissioner Param Bir Singh and BMC chief Praveen Pardeshi on Wednesday, was a request from the police to the civic body to regularise police chowkies that do not have permissions in place.

There are around 189 such chowkies that have been constructed illegally. Following Singh’s request, Pardeshi is said to have called the development plan (DP) department staff, and asked ward-level officials to coordinate and resolve the issue.

The DP department was asked to check if Mumbai’s Development Control Regulations allowed illegal chowkies to be regularised at the site where they currently stand. A senior civic official said Pardeshi directed that those chowkies that could be regularised, should be done on priority. In cases where they cannot be regularised at the same site, then an appropriate space for them should be considered in the vicinity.

Shiv Sena leader and standing committee chairman Yashwant Jadhav said that a few chowkies were constructed in areas several years ago, when the authorities had felt that there was a need for them because of an incident that might have taken place at that time. “It is necessary to check whether these chowkies are still needed now at the same site, and if yes, they should remain there. If not, steps should be taken to move them,” said Jadhav.

A police team, which went as far as Odisha in pursuit of the suspects, said they have come across a well-established racket, which had taken up looting as a vocation.Police said the interstate racket consisted mainly of four persons who had a network of associates in Kerala which provided them with legal assistance when they fall in police net.It was on Tuesday that police recorded the arrest of Das Sahil (23), who police say, was the kingpin of the racket. Three other Odisha natives managed to give the slip to the police.According to officials who went to Odisha for the operation, the suspects used to lead a luxurious lifestyle.

NEW DELHI: Middle distance runner Prachi Choudhary , who had dragged the Athletics Federation of India ( AFI ) to the Supreme Court over her exclusion from the squad for the 2018 Jakarta Asian Games, has failed the dope test for an anabolic steroid, Oxandrolone metabolite, and has been provisionally suspended by the National Anti Doping Agency ( NADA ), TOI has learnt.

Uttar Pradesh's Prachi, a 400m specialist, was tested out of competition by NADA's dope control officers (DCOs) on December 30 at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports centre in Patiala and her urine sample returned dope positive for Oxandrolone at Qatar's Doha testing laboratory.

According to the adverse analytical finding (AAF) notice served to Prachi, she failed to obtain a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) certificate to justify the presence of the banned substance in her system.

As a result, Prachi, a bronze medallist at the Senior Nationals athletics meet in Guwahati 2018, has been provisionally suspended pending a hearing by the disciplinary panel. A period of four-year ineligibility has kicked-in for the presence of non-specified substance in her sample.

Prachi wouldn't be able to participate in any of the qualifying meets for the Tokyo Olympics, as well as the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) sanctioned events.

Prachi, along with fellow middle distance runner Chhavi Sharawat , both of whom had finished third and fourth respectively at the Guwahati meet which acted as a qualifier for the Jakarta Asiad, had levelled allegations against the AFI that the federation overlooked their credentials while favouring other competitors in the women's 400m run for inclusion in the 52-member athletics contingent for the Games. The two had dragged the AFI to the SC, but lost their appeal after the federation convinced the Apex Court about its selection policy.

336,['5/03/2020'],Former UN chief Javier Perez de Cuellar dead at 100,"LIMA: Former UN chief Javier Perez de Cuellar , who was known for his peace-making efforts including brokering a ceasefire in the Iran-Iraq war, died Wednesday in his native Peru, aged 100, his son said.

Perez de Cuellar served as UN secretary general from 1981 to 1991, when he was often described as a ""pacifist by vocation and nature.""

Lauded by his countrymen as one of the most illustrious Peruvians of his era, Perez de Cuellar led the United Nations through a period marked by the fight against world hunger, the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq, as well as the civil war in US-supported El Salvador which led to UN-mediated peace talks.

""My dad died after a complicated week. He died at 8:09 pm tonight (0109 GMT Thursday) and is resting in peace,"" his son Francisco Perez de Cuellar told RPP radio.

Perez de Cuellar was known for his efforts to reconcile warring parties.

He considered the 1990 independence of Namibia, one of the last colonial enclaves on the African continent, his greatest accomplishment as secretary general.

Perez de Cuellar's popularity prompted him to accept the presidential nomination from one of Peru's leading political parties -- the Union for Peru -- in 1995, which pitted him against then-incumbent president Alberto Fujimori.

The unifying force behind the Union for Peru, Perez de Cuellar won only 21.8 percent of the vote, coming in second behind Fujimori who got 64.4 percent.

In 1997, informants revealed that Perez de Cuellar had been subject to systematic surveillance and phone tapping during the campaign, ordered by the head of Fujimori's intelligence services, Vladimiro Montesinos.

Following the collapse of the Fujimori regime in November 2000, Perez de Cuellar was appointed head of a government of ""unity and national reconciliation.""

As prime minister, he helped expose a web of corruption woven by Montesinos over the course of Fujimori's 10-year rule.

After the election of President Alejandro Toledo in 2001, Perez de Cuellar was appointed ambassador to France.

Born into an upper middle-class family in Lima and educated in Catholic schools, Perez de Cuellar spent most of his professional life outside his homeland, in diplomatic posts in Britain, Bolivia, Poland, the former Soviet Union, Switzerland and Venezuela.

He was president of the UN Security Council from 1973 to 1974 and was UN permanent representative in Cyprus from 1975 to 1977.

The career diplomat's son and daughter are from his first marriage, along with six grandchildren. He and his second wife, Marcela Temple, had no children.

A lawyer by education, Perez de Cuellar received honorary doctorates from nearly 40 universities around the world.

Antonio Guterres, who currently heads the UN, wished him ""with pride & joy"" a happy 100th birthday on January 19.

""On this momentous occasion, we at the UN draw on his example for inspiration & are deeply grateful for his many contributions and achievements as Secretary-General,"" Guterres wrote on Twitter.

Perez de Cuellar's remains will lie at the Peruvian foreign ministry before burial on Friday, his son said.

337,['5/03/2020'],MH17 Plane Crash: Five key questions about the MH17 trial,"THE HAGUE: Four suspects are to go on trial in the Netherlands next week accused of playing a role in downing Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine on July 17, 2014.

All 298 passengers and crew on board the Boeing 777 jet died in the crash, which international investigators said was caused by a Russian-made BUK surface-to-air missile.

Here are five key questions about the trial:

Three Russians — Igor Girkin, Sergei Dubinsky and Oleg Pulatov, and a Ukrainian, Leonid Kharchenko — are on trial. All have been linked to separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine.

Girkin, 49, also known by his pseudonym ""Strelkov"", is a former Russian spy and a historical re-enactment enthusiast who helped kickstart the war in eastern Ukraine and ruled part of its territory with an iron fist.

Dubinsky, 57, is a former Russian military intelligence officer who also served as military intelligence chief for the separatists.

Pulatov, 53, is a former Russian special forces officer who served as Dubinsky's deputy.

Kharchenko, 48, also known as ""Krot"", allegedly commanded a separatist combat unit and is accused of securing the missile launcher.

They are charged with murder and deliberately and unlawfully destroying an aeroplane, leading to the deaths of the 298 people on board.

The four suspects ""closely worked together to obtain the BUK missile and (set) it up with the aim to shoot down a plane"", according to Dutch prosecutors.

Under international law, the men are accused of being ""co-perpetrators"", which does not mean they physically pushed the button but rather that their deliberate actions enabled MH17 to be shot down, said Marieke de Hoon of Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam .

If found guilty, sentences can range from 30 years to life as well as a fine of up to 87,000 euros ($95,000).

Russia and Ukraine do not extradite their citizens so none of the four suspects is expected to show up for the trial.

Only Pulatov has appointed a Dutch law firm to represent him, according to media reports.

The trial however is being conducted under a combination of Dutch and international law, which enables the suspects to be tried in absentia.

""The Dutch legal system is respected and acts with some authority. It has gone through a lot of judicial scrutiny,"" said De Hoon.

Yes. Relatives of the victims are expected to play an active role from the start, being present in the courtroom and able to watch proceedings at a secure location away from the media.

Relatives will also be asked later in the trial if they would like to make representations as well as eventually asking the court to award compensation.

The trial takes place at The Hague District Court's high-security facility next to Schiphol international airport -- a stone's throw from where the ill-fated flight took off.

The trial is taking place in The Netherlands largely because the plane to Kuala Lumpur left from Schiphol, and 196 of the passengers were Dutch.

The Netherlands also took the lead in the subsequent Joint Investigative Team (JIT), which also involved Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine.

The trial will be conducted in Dutch, with translations available in English.

341,['5/03/2020'],CAG: Local contractors favoured for Navi Mumbai airport land development,"MUMBAI: The CAG report clearly shows how local contractors were favoured in award of contracts for the development of the Navi Mumbai International Airport land.

The audit also observed that in six cases, where the estimated cost was Rs 890 crore, Cidco awarded the contracts though contractors did not possess the minimum prescribed value of work experience. These included Rs 627-crore airport land development (package IV) awarded to Constructors San Jose-GVK Projects and Technical Services Pvt Ltd. Other contractors similarly awarded were D G Belhekar & Co. Kalpana Struct-Con Pvt Ltd, P D Earthmovers, P P Kharpatil Construction Pvt Ltd and Vishal Construction.

Cidco even waived off marking criteria for technical qualification in seven contracts—they were awarded to local contractors—including the Rs 545-crore contract for land development awarded to Thakur Infraprojects Pvt Ltd and J M Mhatre Infra Pvt Ltd, a Rs 19-crore contract for integrated infrastructure development of sector 27 to Thakur Infraprojects, a Rs 158-crore contract for integrated development in sector 4 to 10 Pushpak Nagar to J M Mhatre Infra, a Rs 34-crore contract to P P Kharpatil Constructions Pvt Ltd, and a Rs 62-crore to P D Earthmovers.

In its defence, Cidco said the marking system was not applicable in physical infrastructure works. The audit said the reply was not tenable as rules for tenders above Rs 15 crore had two bid systems—mandatory eligibility criteria and scoring minimum stipulated marks—which were not adhered to.

Cidco even awarded additional works—again to local contractors—in 10 cases to the tune of Rs 69 crore without inviting tenders. The original contracts were valued at Rs 430 crore.

In another instance of favouring Thakur Infraprojects and J M Mhatre, the audit stated that Cidco had issued letter of acceptance to Associated Soap Stone Distributing Company -Supreme Infrastructure for airport land development. The firm had quoted Rs 204 crore, which was 9.8% below the estimated cost. Cidco, however, cancelled the bid stating the company failed to provide an additional security deposit (ASD) as its bid was less than the estimated cost. Tender conditions required that ASD be insisted upon only if the bid was 15% less than estimated cost which was also the opinion of Cidco’s legal counsel. The contract was then awarded to Thakur and Mhatre for Rs 530 crore, 2.8% less than the estimated cost of Rs 545 crore.

NEW DELHI: Kishwar Jahaan, a resident of riot-affected Khajuri Khas in northeast Delhi, stepped out of her home for the first time on Wednesday after more than a week. Jahaan put her anxieties aside to attend the mega parent-teacher meeting at her daughter's school in the area.

Delhi government had called a special PTM in the schools of northeast Delhi. These institutions have remained closed since February 24 after internal exams were postponed following the riots. Like Jahaan, a large number of parents made the effort to participate in the meeting.

Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia visited a government school at Gokulpuri in the vicinity of the tyre market that was targeted by arsonists during the riots. Gungun, a Class VII student, reported, ""He told us that if we needed anything we should inform our teachers. He also asked us to write our exams without fear.""

Jahaan, who was at the Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya, Khajuri Khas, told TOI , ""The teacher gave us the new dates for the postponed exams. I told the teacher that my children were very scared and hadn't been able to study. How will they write the exams?"" The eldest daughter, Parveen, was at the CBSE exam centre in Karawal Nagar for her Class XII board exams when the rioting began. Parveen was able to return home only the following day. ""She stayed at her teacher's house. But she saw people being beaten and killed and she is traumatised,"" said Jahaan.

At the Government Girls' Senior Secondary School nearby, Hindi teacher Krishna Kumari was surprised to see the large turnout for the PTM. ""We didn't think too many students would come,"" Kumari exclaimed, adding that the meeting was meant to ""counsel student and parents, guide them and give them confidence after the days of violence"".

Another teacher, Sarita, said, ""The students have been told that they shouldn't worry about coming to school because it is a safe space for them. If there are any students who have lost books or stationery items, we will provide them with what they need.""

The announcement on the PTM was sent through phone messages, though some mosques also publicised it on their PA systems.

CHANDIGARH: Police have booked a private school teacher for allegedly raping the mother of one of his students for last more than eight months.

Police said the accused had first molested the woman. When she objected, the accused allegedly threatened her that her son would be expelled from the school if she reported the matter.

Later, the accused started blackmailing her and allegedly forced himself on the woman. The accused allegedly took the woman to different hotels in the Tricity and raped her.

The woman attached hotel bills with her complaint. The complainant said once she got pregnant, the accused forced her to abort the child.

Later, the woman told her husband about the assaults and they filed a complaint at the SSP public window.

The SSP marked an inquiry. After carrying out an investigation and taking legal opinion, police registered a rape case against the accused under the relevant Sections of the IPC. Police said no arrest has been made so far. On February 17, a resident of Uttar Pradesh was arrested for allegedly raping a 16-year-old girl in the city. Both were working as domestic help in a house.

345,['5/03/2020'],Tax officials threaten to cut workload in protest over working conditions,"(Representative image)

MUMBAI: Indian tax officials on Wednesday threatened to cut their workloads in protest over working conditions, a move that could dent New Delhi’s tax collection just as the government scrambles to fill coffers before the fiscal year ends on March 31.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is pushing to shore up revenue as India’s once-booming economy grows at roughly 11-year lows.

Corporate and income tax collection for the current year is likely to fall for the first time in at least two decades, several senior tax officials have told Reuters.

In a statement on Wednesday, two unions representing some 97% of tax officials said they were beginning action for improved working conditions, including the resolution of “pay anomalies” and set contracts for casual workers.

If demands are not met, the unions are planning to stop submitting certain reports and halt search and seizure operations on March 12, before putting an end to overtime work on March 15.

“We go beyond our limits and work for the government. There should some recognition at least for that,” said Dipak Gupta, general secretary at the Income Tax Gazetted Officers’ Association’s Mumbai unit.

In a February 26 letter to the Central Board of Direct Taxes that was seen by Reuters, the unions said there was “undue pressure” on officials to collect taxes and that staff were suffering from unclear promotion rules and career stagnation.

In the letter, the unions said they believed the government would intervene by next Tuesday, in which case they would call off planned protests.

The CBDT and the finance ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the planned action.

Separately, a letter from the CBDT seen by Reuters on Wednesday said it was imperative for officials to make a new amnesty scheme, called 'Vivad se Vishwas', a success.

MUMBAI: Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant on Wednesday demanded former CM and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis ’ resignation following the CAG report on irregularities in awarding of Cidco contracts. Fadnavis though claimed the MVA government had made “selective leakages” of the report and said Cidco was an autonomous body whose its decisions did not come to the minister or CM for approval.

“Fadnavis was not head of Cidco, but as minister for urban development, it was his responsibility to provide a clean and transparent administration. In view of CAG’s stringent observations, Fadnavis must accept responsibility and quit,” Sawant said. Cidco is under the control of the urban development department. “It has been established that all norms were flouted in the tender process and works allotted to firms headed by then Cidco chairman, who was also BJP legislator from Panvel,” Sawant said. He added that the entire tender process was monitored through the CM’s office then headed by Fadnavis.

“In the Rs2,000 crore work for the Navi Mumbai airport, irregularities were of the highest order. It was found that inexperienced contractors were allotted works worth Rs890 crore. More shocking, the Cidco chairman himself was the main contractor,” Sawant alleged.

Fadnavis said, “In case of Navi Mumbai Metro Rail and Nerul-Uran railway project, all tenders were awarded prior to 2014. In case of the mass housing project, the objection is with regard to delay in allotment of tenements. Contract for the project was awarded through nomination in 2013, and it was worth Rs475 crore, but this fact has not been mentioned in the report, nor the fact that the contract awarded in 2017 was for a lesser cost. That this should be excluded is surprising. Perhaps this will be brought out in the CAG report in the next session.”

350,['5/03/2020'],Problem of plenty helps Vidarbha U-23,"Vidarbha U-23 cricketers. (TOI Photo)

NAGPUR: While Vidarbha boys have received deserving accolades for their on-field show in the ongoing Col CK Nayudu Under-23 Trophy, a lot of work was done in the background by the selectors, coach and think-tank.

Vidarbha reached their maiden final in the Nayudu Trophy, annihilating Mumbai in their own den inside two days on Tuesday. It wasn't easy for Suhas Phadkar-led selection panel and even more difficult for coach Trevor Gonsalves, who didn't have a settled playing XI in two successive matches.

When the new season began for Vidarbha Under-23 side last December, the selectors and team management had one major problem - how to rotate players between Ranji Trophy and Under-23 Col CK Nayudu Trophy.

While the selectors managed this quite admirably last year when Vidarbha won the Under-23 One-day and reached the semifinals of Nayudu Trophy, this year was different. Earlier, three Ranji Trophy players were eligible to make it to the final XI of the Under-23 side.

This year, the rule was slightly tweaked. Only three players who have represented their state teams in Ranji Trophy, Vijay Hazare and Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophies, were allowed to be part of the playing XI of the junior team.

When Vidarbha Under-23 started the season, Atharva Taide , Darshan Nalkande and Yash Thakur had already represented Vidarbha in Hazare Trophy. As the season progressed, Aditya Thakare, Aniruddha Choudhari and Siddhesh Wath joined the list. All three made it the Ranji Trophy on the basis of their exploits in the Nayudu Trophy. However, despite losing so many talented players, Vidarbha remained unbeaten in the competition.

Vidarbha openers Taide and Choudhari have seven hundreds between them. However, none could play the semifinal because of the tweaked rule. Choudhari, Nalkande and Thakur were not even part of the squad. ""The rules are such that senior players can't even enter the field as a substitute,"" a VCA source said.

In the quarterfinal, skipper Mohit Kale couldn't be part of the playing XI, while Taide had to miss out in the semifinal despite scoring 746 runs in the competition. Despite key players missing in important matches, Vidarbha have been ruthless. They have registered seven outright victories, out of which four were innings win.

While the priority for VCA was Ranji Trophy, the wider talent pool eventually helped Vidarbha Under-23. The Under-19 team has reached the semifinal of Cooch Behar Trophy for three successive years now, though they lost the last two finals. However, there has been a constant flow of talent.

Under-19 all-rounder Harsh Dubey made immediate impact when he was drafted in the squad for quarterfinals. He did well in the semifinal too. Pacers Nachiket Bhute and Dushyant, who were revelations in the Cooch Behar 2018-19 season sharing more than 80 wickets, filled up big shoes of Thakur of Nalkande perfectly.

Coach Gonslaves also did a great job with his boys. ""He has excellent communication skills. He handled the boys very well kept them in good space of mind. His man management skills are superb and he knows how to handle these grown up boys.

""Vidarbha have now reached the knock-out phase of every tournament since last year under him. While he has great bunch of youngsters, it's important to manage them properly, which he did with aplomb. The selectors also did a great job. They made sure every domestic performer was rewarded,"" the VCA source said.

So far, Vidarbha haven't put a foot wrong. They would be hoping to continue the intensity in the final as well.

353,['5/03/2020'],"Now, residents across Mumbai can ignore public parking lots, leave car on roads near home!","Representative image

MUMBAI: After giving a “special” exemption to residents of Shivaji Park area in the island city, the civic administration has now decided to waive off penalty for residents across Mumbai parking on roads near their homes despite having a public parking lot within 500 metres.

Locals will be issued passes and charged a monthly fee for parking on roads in their neighbourhood. However, this is not applicable to those who do not stay in the particular neighbourhood but park on the roads in the area. Besides, residents of societies that have parking space cannot avail of this facility.

Residents living in areas around public parking lots have been opposing the BMC’s move last year to impose steep penalties.

The BMC commissioner’s office said the civic chief has asked ward officers to coordinate with the traffic department and identify roads where parking can be allowed after examining the requirements of the local residents.

On Wednesday, TOI reported about two questionable decisions—largely favouring residents of Shivaji Park— of BMC to drop parking penalties and to allow vehicles to be parked on 15 roads that were designated no-parking zone in G-North ward, comprising Shivaji Park, Dadar (west) and Matunga (west).

Reacting to the BMC’s decision, Bandra corporator Asif Zakaria said, “This means they (BMC) are accepting that earlier they committed a mistake by implementing the (No Parking) policy haphazardly without any planning. It also means that the penalty imposed on local residents close to these PPLs earlier were wrong, so they should return their money.” He added, “It seems that the BMC not taken the Parking Authority into confidence . If you have the authority to suggest you on parking issue, but you are not taking their suggestion to implement related policy.”

Sources said the Mumbai Parking Authority, headed by former IAS officer Gautam Chatterjee , was not taken into confidence when the BMC took the decision to give Shivaji Park residents an exemption.

The BMC has set up the parking authority to deal with the city’s traffic problem, study vehicles movements, road congestion and advise on-off street parking.

Sources said that earlier also when the BMC took the decision to impose heavy penalty for parking near PPLs, it had not discussed with the Parking Authority. After Chatterjee expressed his disagreement over the penalties, the BMC revised them in January.

354,['5/03/2020'],CAG slams Cidco for flouting rules in awarding infra works,"MUMBAI: The Comptroller and Auditor General has come down heavily on the City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) for lapses in awarding contracts for major infrastructure projects. Among the projects it has looked into, as TOI had reported on February 28, is the Navi Mumbai Metro Rail, whose cost was revised from Rs 1,694 crore to Rs 3,064 crore.

The audit has shown the NMMR project was to be completed in May-June 2014. But by then, only 39% of work was completed, chiefly because of delay in completion of station work. Cidco terminated contracts only in February and December 2017, which, CAG said, had “a cascading effect on the completion of station work and related rail systems work.” In case of the viaduct over the railway crossing at Taloja, CAG said the consultant delayed finalising cost of railway crossing span work by 18 months.

The audit has raised questions about the tendering system, saying tender conditions were changed after ‘request for proposal’ were purchased by bidders, “which limited participation by other parties.” Cidco overpaid Rs 25 crore to the contractor for mobilisation of equipment. “As of August 2019 Cidco had already incurred an expenditure of Rs 1,759 crore on partly constructed facilities such as viaducts and elevated stations which could be put to use only when entire project is completed,” states the report. The report has blamed Cidco for “lack of vision,” stating it “ did not prepare any long, medium or short-term plans... with the result the proposals were sanctioned on a case to case basis.” NMMR is to be thrown open to the public this year. Trial run was held in 2018. The CAG looked at projects from April 2013 to March 2018. Unlike in the past years, when the CAG report would be tabled on the last day of the state legislature session, the Maha Vikas Aghadi government tabled it on Wednesday.

356,['5/03/2020'],social security: Prosecutors urge denial of early prison release for Madoff,"Former financier Bernard Madoff exits Federal Court in New York. Citing the scope and magnitude of his decades... Read More

NEW YORK: Bernard Madoff should not be released early from prison even if kidney disease kills him within months, prosecutors said Wednesday as they cited the scope and magnitude of his decades-long Ponzi scheme that cost thousands of investors billions of dollars.

Over 500 victims had written to a Manhattan federal court judge to oppose early release for the 81-year-old Madoff from a 150-year sentence imposed in 2009, while only 20, or 4% of letter writers, supported it, prosecutors said.

Madoff had demonstrated ``a wholesale lack of understanding of the seriousness of his crimes and a lack of compassion for his victims, underscoring that he is undeserving of compassionate release himself,'' prosecutors said.

Prosecutors cited numerous letters from victims, including one from a woman who said her husband of 40 years committed suicide after learning of the fraud and another in which an 84-year-old victim said: ``Why should he be shown any compassion, when he had none for his many victims?''

Madoff's lawyer had asked that he be released early under the terms of a program that permits compassionate release for some inmates if they have less than 18 months to live.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons has agreed he has less than 18 months to live but has denied early release on the grounds that it ``would minimize the severity of his offense.''

Madoff is confined to a wheelchair while he battles terminal kidney disease and other ailments, his lawyer said in an early February court filing.

The attorney, Brandon Sample, said Madoff has a back brace and medical shoes and is permitted to be aided by an inmate companion as he suffers from leg cramps, weakness, fatigue and uses an oxygen container to relieve shortness of breath.

``The government recognizes the serious nature of Madoff's illness and his general eligibility for a sentence reduction, Sample said in a statement Wednesday night. ``Madoff, despite what the government might claim, is remorseful for his conduct. A reply addressing the government's other contentions will be filed.``

Madoff began his sentence months after he confessed to his family and others that the $17.5 billion entrusted to him by thousands of investors had never been invested, even though he claimed it had grown in value by tens of billions of dollars. At the time, there was only several hundred thousand dollars left.

His Ponzi scheme, estimated to have begun as early as the 1980s, destroyed or crippled the finances of many individuals and charitable organizations worldwide.

Meanwhile, prosecutors said in their filing Wednesday, Madoff live extravagantly, using investor money to buy a $4.4 million Manhattan home, fund a $6.5 million loan for a home in Nantucket and to finance two yachts worth $11.5 million and the salaries of housekeepers and a personal boat captain.

In arguing for compassionate release for Madoff, Sample called his client's sentence ``symbolic,'' saying it was given for retribution, deterrence and for the victims.

He argued compassionate release was appropriate in light of his terminal illness, life expectancy of less than 18 months and ``our society's value and understanding of compassion.''

If freed, Madoff will live with a friend, financially supported by Social Security and Medicare benefits, Sample wrote.

Sample did not immediately comment on Wednesday's submission by prosecutors.

Last week, Irving H. Picard, a trustee appointed to recover money for Madoff's victims, reported that $13.93 billion had been recovered and nearly all of it had been distributed, meaning nearly 70% of the allowable losses reported by Madoff's customers will have been repaid.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Wednesday dismissed a public interest litigation ( PIL ) which challenged the AAP government's decision to grant compensation to all victims of the violence in the northeast district.

A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar underlined that grant of compensation is a policy decision and refused to interfere with the government's decision. ""This is not a compensation given on fault basis. The compensation is being awarded on a no-fault basis. There is nothing wrong with it,"" the court said, while dismissing a plea by former lawmaker, Nand Kishore Garg .

The perpetrators of the riots must be denied the compensation and they must not be treated as victims, the plea urged. It sought directions to strike down the order of compensation to all riot victims, claiming them as being unreasonable and arbitrary.

Garg sought that victims of the riots be identified before payment of compensation to ensure those who ""perpetrated"" the violence do not get the relief. But the high court disagreed with the contention, saying if the petitioner's suggestion was accepted, then the scheme ""would become totally unworkable."" ""It would be impossible to implement,"" the bench said.

Meanwhile, in a related development, the high court directed the AAP government and police on Wednesday to ensure there is no breach of security at the centres till all the Class X and Class XII board examinations are over in riot-affected northeast Delhi. Justice Rajiv Shakdher asked the cops to continue providing security till the last examination.

359,['5/03/2020'],Narendra Mehta: Former BJP MLA Narendra Mehta gets interim relief in rape case,"Representative image

MUMBAI: The Bombay high court in an interim order on Wednesday directed the Thane police crime branch not to take coercive steps against former BJP MLA, Narendra Mehta, in a rape case filed against him if he cooperated with the police.

Mehta had petitioned the HC to have the February 28 case against him quashed. At a hearing of his plea before a bench of acting Chief Justice B P Dharmadhikari and Justice N R Borkar, his counsel Aabad Ponda argued he was married to the alleged victim in 2001 and “so there can never be rape”. He said she had a baby, too, out of the wedlock.

Ponda argued Mehta had “been regularly in touch with her and even on phone’’ and that she had charged him with rape “after 20 years.” He said she had applied for a caste certificate only last month and that he could point to several documents to prove she belonged to the general category.

Appearing for the complainant, counsel Rizwan Merchant , opposed grant of any relief and submitted the FIR could not be broken into parts to selectively say it was “by consent’’. He argued Mehta had offered her a job, knew of her personal status and yet proposed to her and married her, but asked her to keep it under wraps to maintain his public image.

He argued the marriage was based on misconception of facts and, hence, consent could not be presumed. He also cited judgments to show his custodial interrogation was essential. He said Mehta had “22 FIRs against him and has not been arrested yet.’’ “He has clout and all witnesses will disappear, unless he is interrogated,’’ he argued.

The public prosecutor said the accused had made a “casteist slur’’ against the woman and there was a “threat to her life.’’ He said he would file a reply within two weeks on his plea.

NAGPUR: Rejecting all allegations made against him in the multi-crore irrigation scam, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar once against opposed any move to hand over the investigation to central agencies like the CBI, ED, Serious Fraud Investigating Office (SFIO), and I-T Department.

Ahead of next week’s final hearing into the PILs filed by petitioners Jan Manch and Atul Jagtap , Pawar, who is respondent number 7, asserted that no exceptional case was made out by petitioners for handing over the investigation to central agencies.

Earlier, the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) had opposed the handing over of the investigation to the CBI, ED, SFIO and I-T, saying it would hamper its ongoing investigations. It said it was working diligently and registered many offences against contractors and VIDC officials through its Special Investigations Teams (SITs) in Nagpur and Amravati divisions.

Pawar in his latest affidavit filed before the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court this week stated that change of government after assembly polls can not be the grounds for change of investigating agency. “When the petitioner has full faith in investigating agency earlier, how has he lost faith after the change in the government?” he said.

Questioning the locus standi of Jagtap, Pawar said he was himself the contractor and had filed many tenders in various projects. “The petitioner shouldn’t use courts for settling personal scores. He’s having a mala fide notion of a scam which is yet to be proved. The courts can’t look or supervise investigations and also can’t direct that particular person should me made an accused,” he said.

Denying Jagtap’s allegations that the investigation against Pawar was not being conducted properly, the three-time deputy chief minister said he was being questioned and interrogated on September 11 last year, and also made to provide written replies to questionnaire. “The petitioner shouldn’t have biased approach as investigations against him were conducted during previous government and various FIRs against contractors were lodged in their tenure. I can’t be called on to answer every question, as I am not made as an accused in any complaint so far.”

After the 2018 incident, a consultant was appointed to estimate the cost of a new bridge. The initial estimate was pegged at Rs87 crore, but civic officials expected the final cost to increase.

Gokhale Nagar

In an unusual order, theon Wednesday askedto pay the Rs 4.5-lakh loan taken by the kin of a patient who died during treatment at the hospital.Sarika Dongre, wife of deceased, complained to the charity commissioner, asking for refund of money paid to the hospital despite belonging to a poor economy class. However, the charity officer has refused to consider the refund demand.resident Dongre (34) was admitted to Ruby Hall Clinic for acute pancreatitis and secondary acute respiratory distress on December 11, 2019. He expired on January 16. The bill incurred amounted to Rs 12.68 lakh, of which the family had paid some and Rs 6.79 lakh remained unpaid. Soon after Dongre had died, his relatives vandalised the hospital, creating chaos at the hospital. However, the issue was sorted out by police with no case being registered.Ruby Hall Clinic officials had then complained to the charity commissioner, claiming the relatives were not ready to pay the bill after Dongre’s demise. “During the entire month, the family never spoke about indigent patients’ fund (IPF), a scheme under which poor are provided free or discounted treatment. Even his brother took responsibility of paying the bill. After Dongre’s demise, they created ruckus and were not ready to pay the pending bill,” the hospital said in a complaint dated January 29, 2020, adding, “On humanitarian grounds, the hospital has forgone the unpaid bill of Rs 6.79 lakh, which is a huge amount. In spite of this, the relatives are claiming for refund of the paid bill. We got information from the social media that the brother runs a business and they cannot be considered poor under any scheme. Despite this, the family is insisting and compelling the hospital to consider the patient for free treatment and asking for refund. Such behaviour is not acceptable.”On the other hand, Sarika complained to the charity commissioner, claiming that despite informing officials about the IPF scheme, the hospital “forced them to pay” on regular intervals. “Till now, we have spent more than Rs 20 lakh for my husband’s treatment, for which we took loans from kin. After his death, the hospital is avoiding to pay concession fees. We also informed them that I have two children who are studying, but to no avail. They kept telling us to approach the charity commissioner,” she said.Deputy charity commissioner Navnath Jagtap said their decision was accepted by both parties. “The bill paid by any patient cannot be refunded as it’s a charitable hospital. The family pays the bill when they have the capacity, but the charity office comes in the picture if poor patients have no money to continue treatment. It is always better to inform the hospital and us initially if they belong to the poor patient’s category, which avoids chaos in future. The hospital has waived a huge chunk of bill, which has to be appreciated. The deceased is survived by two children, looking at which we have asked the hospital to take care of the loan of Rs 4.5 lakh taken for treatment,” he said.An unhappy Bomi Bhote, chief executive officer of Ruby Hall Clinic, said, “The hospital, despite the patient not being a genuine case of IPF, on humanitarian ground gave a huge discount. If the loan has been approved, the family has a financial condition to repay it. On the other hand, the money paid was more than Rs 6 lakh, which they were asking for refund. Poor patients don’t have that money to pay or even don’t get loans. A person getting loan and paying lakhs can’t be financially poor,” he said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-103150,msid-74482888/74482888.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ruby-hall-asked-to-repay-rs-4-5-lakh-load-taken-for-patients-treatment/articleshow/74487141.cms

With Covid-19 infection reaching 70 countries including India which reported spike in, prominent clubs are leaving nothing to chanceAs thescare takes the country in its grip with 26 fresh positive cases reported from Gurgaon, Delhi, Jaipur, Agra and Telangana– and two suspected cases closer home in Ahmedabad – city clubs are cancelling Holi parties to avoid mega public gatherings.Karnavati Club, Rajpath Club,, YMCA Club and others had earlier planned dry Holi parties with gulal, giving the more popular rain dance parties a miss. However, now with a spurt in positive cases, the clubs are leaving nothing to chance.They have therefore decided to cancel Holi parties this year to do their bit to prevent spread of the deadly virus. According to the club managements, usually the members and their guests are well-travelled and take off frequently to countries abroad for business purposes. It is quite possible that people may be carriers of the virus and therefore it is only wise to put in place strict social distancing measures to avoid human-to-human spread of the disease, they say.Earlier on Wednesday, PM Narendra Modi too had announced his decision to not celebrate Holi in a tweet that stated: “Experts across the world have advised to reduce mass gatherings to avoid the spread of COVID-19. Hence, this year I have decided not to participate in any Holi Milan programme.”Ketan Patel, secretary of Karnavati Club, who was recently on a Delhi-Ahmedabad flight, said, “Seeing people with face masks at the airport and in the flight, I was terrified. The cases being reported worldwide are a cause for serious concern. Looking at the present circumstances, the club management decided to cancel the preplanned Holi party.”Likewise, Sports Club has also cancelled their Holi event. They have already put up a list of dos and don’ts on the club’s notice board to apprise members of the precautions that need to be taken.Chiranjiv Patel, Vice President of Sports Club, told Mirror, “Holi celebration is an annual event but with concerns mounting over spike in coronavirus cases, we didn’t want to take any chance and decided to cancel the event for the safety of our members.”Rajpath Club has not been conducting the rain dance parties for many years now and this time they aren’t planning a Holi party either. Talking to Mirror, Dr, Senior Vice President of Rajpath Club said, “We were among the first to introduce rain dance in the club circuit but for the past few years we aren’t organising these parties in order to save water. Moreover, in a situation like this we also cannot think of a mass gathering. Therefore, there won’t be any Holi party in Rajpath Club.”Aprivate party organiser had booked YMCA club for a Holi party about a month ago. However, they are in the process of cancelling it., CEO of YMCA Club, said, “With a sudden spike in the cases in India and more countries across the world reporting deaths and fresh cases, organisers are rethinking about the Holi event. In all likelihood, looking at the situation, it will be cancelled.”",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-38044,msid-74483548/74483548.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-clubs-cancel-holi-festivities/articleshow/74487187.cms
380,['5/03/2020'],India's mental and technical frailties were exposed by New Zealand: VVS Laxman,"Virat Kohli talks to Kane Williamson after losing the Test series against New Zealand in Christchurch. (AFP Ph... Read More

NEW DELHI: Former Indian batsman VVS Laxman expressing his disappointment at Team India's Test series defeat against New Zealand but was left impressed in the manner in which Indian captain Virat Kohli didn't offer any excuses for the defeat.

In his column for the Times of India, Laxman wrote, ""It was refreshing to hear Virat Kohli offer no excuses for the 0-2 loss in New Zealand and stress on acceptance of the outcome, but I hope India do address the issues that hurt them badly in probably one of their worst overseas outings of late. The next Test series isn't until December, so the temptation to write this off as a one-off could be overwhelming. But if India wants to avoid a repeat of this display in Australia later in the year, they can't afford to gloss over what transpired in New Zealand.""

In the two Tests, on traditional New Zealand green wickets, India managed scores of 165, 191, 242 and 124.

""I am sure the batting group would be hurting, especially, since they take a lot of pride in preparation but were caught napping by New Zealand's gameplans for two Test matches in a row. I agree the conditions were tricky and challenging, but that's no reason why there shouldn't have been a greater application from the batsmen. New Zealand's plans were straightforward enough - to get swing with the new ball and make use of the lateral movement and, should that fail to produce wickets, to resort to the liberal use of the short ball,"" Laxman added.

There were only four half-centuries across four innings in this series with techniques of some of the players like Ajinkya Rahane , Mayank Agarwal against seam and swing leaving a lot to be desired.

""Ajinkya Rahane's tortured stint in the second innings in Christchurch best illustrated India's confusion. For an experienced and accomplished batsman who has scored runs all around the world, Rahane seemed all at sea against Neil Wagner and Kyle Jamieson 's short-ball barrage, and tried to hit his way out of trouble. On that surface, it was a method never designed to succeed,"" Laxman opined.

Skipper Kohli's 38 runs in four innings was one of the biggest setbacks for the Indians in the series. Kohli's low contributions were 2, 19, 3 and 14.

""The other aspect that stood out was a repetition of mistakes from the same batsmen. Virat was trapped leg before to the ball coming in twice in the second Test, Mayank Agarwal fell in similar fashion in both innings in Christchurch to Trent Boult 's inswingers, Prithvi Shaw was cramped up and dismissed fending balls following him in the second innings of both Tests. Test cricket is an unforgiving cauldron where there is no room for tentativeness. India's technical and mental frailties were badly exposed by a New Zealand side that looked out for the count during the T20s, but that knows how to win at home better than most other teams,"" Laxman wrote.

Indian pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah endured a dry spell in the ODIs and drew flak from some quarters as India lost the series 0-3.

""It was great to see Jasprit Bumrah return to somewhere near his best after an iffy ODI series,"" Laxman concluded.

382,['5/03/2020'],Organic markets a big hit in Kochi,"Representative image

KOCHI: A unique vegetable market in Kakkanad is today one of the most sought-after destination for Kochiites looking out to buy organic vegetables and fruits. The Sunday market sells a wide variety of pesticide-free vegetables and fruits that include lettuce, pumpkin, lady's finger, cucumber, yam, tapioca, papaya, chilli, banana, string beans, snake gourd, bitter gourd vegetables and tubers, among others.

The market gained prominence after Nattu Nanma, a group of 30 farmers, came together four years ago to sell organic farm produce. Over the years, it has become popular among customers who come from various parts of the city. Farmers from Chalakkudy, Cherthala, Palakkad and distant areas of Ernakulam sell their products here.

Induchoodan S, vice-president of Nattu Nanma, said the farmers ensure that they sell only organic products in the market. ""We even visit the farm, where the vegetables and fruits are cultivated land and fix the rates keeping in mind the interests of both consumers and farmers. Since farmers sell their products directly to consumers by avoiding middlemen, they earn their profits,"" he said.

The consumers can also directly communicate with the farmers through a WhatsApp group and can book the products before they reach market.

The Sunday market at Kakkanad is not the only to hold the fascination of the customers. A few other such organic markets have come up in the city, which have also got takers. One such Sunday market is operational at Kacheripady for the past few months. ""I bring pesticide-free vegetables from Cherthala and get a good amount from the market,"" says Satheesh, who sells both vegetables and tubers .

The consumers admit the price is on a bit higher side. ""Though the price is high, I buy vegetables from this market. I believe these are organic products. When we eat banana, we know the difference between organic and the one grown using pesticides. Organic ones are tastier,"" says Abilash Sugunadas living in Kacheripady.

384,['5/03/2020'],Losing a partner makes you more prone to succumbing to skin cancer,"If you have misunderstood the headline, here is some clarity. Individuals who experience the loss of a partner are not likely to be diagnosed with melanoma or skin cancer but are said to be at an increased risk of dying from the disease, according to a new research.Stress can act in strange and dangerous ways. While previous studies have suggested a link between various types of stress and progression of melanoma, which may have played a role in the finding, the researchers suggest that an alternative explanation could be that bereaved people no longer have a close person to help notice skin changes.The absence of a close person delays the possible detection of melanoma, and therefore diagnosis. And by the time the cancer shows up, it is already quite advanced and is more aggressive and harder to treat.According to Angel Wong, lead author and Research Fellow at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, ""Many factors can influence melanoma survival. Our work suggests that melanoma may take longer to detect in bereaved people, potentially because partners play an important role in spotting early signs of skin cancer."" The paper was published in the British Journal of Dermatology.""Support for recently bereaved people, including showing how to properly check their skin, could be vital for early detection of skin cancer, and thus improved survival.""The researchers, led by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and Aarhus University Hospital, investigated whether bereaved individuals had a higher risk of being diagnosed with, or dying from, melanoma than the non-bereaved.They used data from two large population-based studies between 1997 and 2017 in the UK and Denmark.They found that melanoma patients who experienced bereavement had a 17 per cent higher risk of dying from their melanoma compared with those who were not bereaved, with similar results seen in both the UK and Denmark.This study also showed that those who had lost a partner were 12 per cent less likely to be diagnosed with melanoma compared with non-bereaved persons, with 620 and 1667 bereaved diagnosed in the UK and Denmark respectively over the 20 year period, compared with 6,430 and 16,166 non-bereaved.This delays detection of a possible melanoma, and therefore diagnosis, until the cancer has progressed to later stages, when it is generally more aggressive and harder to treat.Each year, 197,000 people are diagnosed with melanoma globally.The survival rate of melanoma patients is relatively high, depending on what stage the cancer is at detection. Early detection and treatment are crucial for improving survival.The researchers encourage family members or caregivers to perform skin examinations for the remaining partner, and call for clinicians to lower their threshold for undertaking skin examinations in bereaved people.""Detecting melanoma early can greatly improve survival and partners are key to this. Those without a partner should be vigilant in checking their skin, particularly in hard to reach locations such as the back, scalp, and ears,"" suggested Dr Walayat Hussain of the British Association of Dermatologists.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74478411,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-759849/74478411.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/de-stress/losing-a-partner-makes-you-more-prone-to-succumbing-to-skin-cancer/articleshow/74478408.cms

HYDERABAD: Two days after a 24-year-old software professional was confirmed as the first case of Covid-19 in Hyderabad, two more suspected cases tested positive in the first round of testing at the ICMR laboratory at Gandhi Medical College in Secunderabad. The samples have been sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, for final confirmation. Across India, 23 new cases were recorded on Wednesday, taking the total number of positive case to 29.

State health authorities also said that the first Covid-19 positive patient was stable even as 39 more with symptoms were isolated at Gandhi Hospital and Fever Hospital on Wednesday. Another 55 people, who approached authorities for tests, were advised to quarantine themselves at home for 14 days.

The two new cases whose samples have been sent to NIV include a software professional from Raheja Mindspace in the IT hub who had visited Italy. The other is a sanitation worker at Apollo Hospitals at Secunderabad where the first positive patient had been treated initially. ""The NIV report is expected on Thursday evening,"" said Dr G Srinivas Rao, Telangana director public health.

45 who tested negative discharged, isolated at home

The two patients are being kept in isolation at Gandhi Hospital. The 45 others who tested negative were discharged and advised strict home isolation for 14 days.” On Wednesday, state health minister Eatala Rajender asked IT professionals and others not to panic. “Currently we have only one confirmed positive case,” he said. “The two others are yet to be reconfirmed. The extensive sanitisation activity at Mahendra Hills is also a precautionary measure. We are not taking any chances. We are following protocol for surveillance but that doesn’t mean the virus has spread.”

NEW DELHI: Domestic equity indices edged up on Thursday, supported by a rise in Asian and US markets, but worries over a spike in coronavirus cases in the country kept gains in check.

The NSE Nifty index rose 0.25% to 11,276.3 in early trade, while the benchmark BSE Sensex was up 0.26% at 38,505.2.

The markets closed lower on Wednesday as the total number of known coronavirus cases rose sharply, fuelling concerns that a rapid spread could further hit an already slowing economy.

""Markets will be volatile as virus fears persist, it is very difficult to say that the trend has changed right now,"" said Siddharth Khemka, head of retail research at Motilal Oswal Securities.

Wall Street surged on Wednesday after former US vice president Joe Biden, considered less likely to raise taxes and impose new regulations than rival Bernie Sanders, rolled to victories on the biggest day of voting in the Democratic nomination campaign.

The US House of Representatives also approved an $8.3 billion funding bill to combat the spread of the coronavirus.

India is pushing state-run banks to approve new loans amounting to Rs 50,000-60,000 crore ($6.8-$8.2 billion) by the end of March, two government sources told Reuters, in efforts to shore up a stuttering economy as the virus spreads.

Consumer goods company Hindustan Unilever Ltd was the top boost to the indexes, rising as much as 3.6% to a one-week high.

IT stocks also contributed, with Tata Consultancy Services Ltd up 1.4% and HCL Technologies Ltd rising 3%.

Large cap banks and energy firms were among the top drags. ICICI Bank Ltd fell 1.5%, while Reliance Industries Ltd slipped 0.8%.

The state government has approved a proposal for providing Rs 100 crore for the project,’’ a senior official said.

The official said huge manpower will be required for setting up the courts. It has been proposed that for every court, there will be one judge and a staff of seven. “We will require a total of 1,104 persons, including 138 judges for these courts. We have approved a proposal for appointment of judges and subordinate staff on contract basis for one year,’’ he said.

As per the official order, while 26 courts will be set up in Mumbai, 18 in Thane, 16 in Pune, seven in Amravati and five in Nagpur, while one court under POCSO Act will be set up in each district. “All these courts have been set up for one year, we expect that all pending cases will be disposed of within the stipulated period,’’ he said.

DIBRUGARH: After 22 days of captivity, banned militant outfit Ulfa (Independent) finally released Baikuntha Handique - a supervisor of a stone-crushing unit who was abducted from Jagun area of Tinsukia district on Wednesday.

According to police, Handique was released early on Wednesday near Lungri basti village in Arunachal Pradesh 's Changlang district. The village, being a remote one, police personnel had to trek many kilometres to rescue him. ""He is in good health but seems a little disoriented. Though he spoke very little, he has confirmed that he was abducted by the Ulfa (I). He will be taken for a health check-up and we will initiate investigation as well,"" a police official said.

Handique, a resident of 9 Mile area of Jagun, is a supervisor in a stone-crushing unit owned by one Raju Khan of Digboi . On February 11, Handique had gone to visit a stone quarry at Wara area. It is from there that then his whereabouts remained unknown.

Enraged by the failure of the police to rescue the abducted person, hundreds of locals from Jagun had blocked NH-315 on February 20 for several hours demanding his immediate release. The protesters also made an appeal to Ulfa (I) commander in-chief Paresh Baruah to ensure his early release.

It is still unclear what made the insurgent outfit to release the employee but sources said that a certain amount of ransom was paid for his safe release.

NEW DELHI: Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc is finally stepping on the gas in India where it currently has only 3,100 rooms across 19 properties. The American hospitality major will add 3,200 rooms in 17 new properties over the next four years.

While Hilton will be adding properties in some cities where it is already present like Jaipur, it will also venture into new markets like Hyderabad and Varanasi. There will be a greater focus on tier II cities in coming times, said Dhruv Hoon, Hilton India ’s VP-development.

“We will be almost doubling our presence in India in next four years, with 1,300 rooms in seven hotels going to open in the next 22 months. These are going to mainly management contracts and a few franchises,” said Hoon. The group plans to brings its top of the line Waldorf Astoria to India and is looking at Delhi, Mumbai or Goa as one of the possible locations. It is also looking at bringing our luxury brands ‘Curio Collection’ and Tapestry Collection’ to India, Hoon added.

Thanks to its small presence in India, Hilton is not facing the brunt of coronavirus’ negative impact on travel in the country. “Operationally speaking (on an overall level) all industries are affected by the coronavirus outbreak. We hope this passes soon. On development side, it is not impacting our plans for India as having new hotels is a long term program that happens over three to four years,” Hoon said.

“With our current development pipeline (signed deals), we continue to expand in Mumbai, Bengaluru, Pune, Goa and Jaipur. Further, we will enter new markets such as Hyderabad and Varanasi. We are keen to expand to other exciting resort markets such as Udaipur and Lonavala amongst others. Going forward, we expect more development activity in tier II markets,” Hoon said.

All upcoming Hilton hotels in India will be “digital key” compliant. This opens any door a guest will normally access with a key card like room, elevators and fitness centre. “Open the app, and when you are within a few feet of a door, simply push the button to unlock. To use the digital key, you have to request access by opting in through the Hilton Honors app first,” says the Hilton website.

About 40 activists of KMSS and its allied organizations are likely to be grilled by the Crime Branch of Assam Police for their alleged involvement in the violence during anti- Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests in December last year.

On Wednesday, police grilled KMSS president Bhasco De Saikia, adviser Subrata Chakraborty and president of the Guwahati city committee of Satra Mukti Sangram Samiti (SMSS), Ashiq Ali. Apart from the three leaders, convener of Swaraj Asom and once a close associate of Akhil, Bhaben Handique, IIT-Guwahati research scholar Himalay Bora, Anusuchit Jati Yuba Chatra Parishad president Rubul Das and Raktim Thakuria of All Assam Publishers and Book Sellers' Association and some other top leaders of KMSS were also interrogated by the sleuths of the Crime Branch. They were later allowed to go home. All were summoned relating to the Crime Branch PS Case No 01/2019.

""The NIA court in Guwahati sought a reply from the Guwahati Central Jail authorities on his (Akhil's) health condition. Though the reply was furnished by the authorities, it came in the afternoon. So, we are expecting a judgment from the NIA court tomorrow,"" said KMSS joint general secretary Mukut Deka.

He added that the jail authorities also sought reports of Akhil's previous medical treatment from his wife on Wednesday and the same were sent to jail authorities immediately. ""If the jail authorities are unable to provide Akhil proper treatment, KMSS is ready to bear the expenses for his treatment. Akhil must be admitted to hospital without further delay,"" said Deka.

Swaraj Asom convener Bhaben Handique said, ""I was asked about my association with Akhil and how I came in touch with Arvind Kejriwal later as I was the founding joint coordinator of Aam Admi Party in Assam in 2013. I clearly said I believe in parliamentary democracy, while Akhil trusts street protests.""

KMSS insiders said those questioned by the Crime Branch on Wednesday were summoned in connection with the large-scale vandalism and destruction of property in Guwahati and upper Assam soon after the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill (CAB) was passed in Parliament in December last year.

Not only that, concepts like the struggle of a transgender mom or a female protagonist starting afresh in life breaking the taboo of a divorcee woman can also be seen on Bengali TV.Not to forget the dialogues which have reportedly become quite ‘bold’ talking about live-in relationship and other topics, which was a strict ‘NO’ on Bengali television even until a few days ago though Bengali films were never hesitant to talk about several topics which are considered as taboo.Adding to the list, the second promo of ‘Prothoma Kadombini ’ talks about menstruation and the taboo around it. The first promo featuring Solanki Roy as Dr. Kadambini Ganguly , the first female medical practitioner in the British-ruled era, drew much attention.The video starts with little Kadombini whose dad tells her, nothing is more important to a doctor than a patient. In the second part of the same promo, Kadombini is all grown up and she reaches the home of a patient. But she faces the first hurdle as the ladies deny allowing her inside crossing the puja room without the assurance that she isn’t menstruating. What comes hard-hitting is that the ladies of that particular household ask her to strip in order to prove that she isn’t menstruating. For a moment, Kadombini hesitates but she recalls how her dad once explained that a patient should be her highest priority. Following the demand of the ladies, Kadombini decides to satisfy their curiosity.Here's the promo:The promo tried to underline the similarity between the then era when the society was more conservative and now in 2020 when a recent incident of period-shaming took was reported in Gujarat Recently, in an incident female students of a hostel were allegedly taken to the restroom and forced to show their undergarments to prove that they aren’t menstruating.

423,['5/03/2020'],Narendra Modi: Saamna roasts PM Modi for social media ‘drama’,"MUMBAI: Saamna on Wednesday flayed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his “shortlived suspense drama” on giving up his social networking media. Stating that Ratan Tata has been using social media for “positive” results, Saamna advised the PM to take a leaf out of the noted industrialist’s book.

A day after Modi’s tweet hinting at the possibility of discontinuing his social media accounts, Saamna, in an editorial, said the PM had played the clever game of administering a shock to countrymen.

This is Saamna’s first onslaught on Modi after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray ’s recent meeting with the Prime Minister in New Delhi. Thackeray held talks with the PM for over an hour, triggering speculation that the Sena, which heads a tripartite alliance with the NCP and the Congress in Maharashtra, may be keen on inching closer to the BJP, its former power ally in the state.

“Social media is the heart of the BJP...They used the Goebbels’s technique, and the Congress party vanished from the political scene,” said the Shiv Sena mouthpiece, stating Modi’s talk of giving up his social networking account was a carefully planned strategic move. “When enough dramatic effect had been created, Modi administered the last shock by saying his accounts on Twitter, Facebook , Instagram and YouTube would be handled by women who inspire us on Women’s Day on March 8.”

Pooh-poohing Modi’s earlier announcement that he was contemplating giving up his social media account, Saamna said this was akin to the capitalist US adopting the policies of Communist China. “Five and a half crore people follow Modi on Twitter. Modi’s Facebook reaches out to five crore people. Modi has access to people through Instagram and YouTube. How can Modi take a decision to give up all this?” asked Saamna.

However, the saffron morninger warned that social media had its limitations. “It is certainly not a social indicator. The BJP’s cyber generals lost the Jharkhand assembly election. The party had to suffer defeat in the New Delhi polls notwithstanding the key role played by its cyber army,” recalled Saamna. Social media is the BJP’s oxygen and it seems impossible Modi would give it up, it said.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The opposition UDF staged a walkout in the assembly on Wednesday, alleging laxity on the part of state's GST department in collecting tax on gold, 'which has cost the state exchequer a huge GST income of Rs 2,700 crore in 2019-20'. The UDF also alleged that an 'underworld' in gold business was thriving in Kerala due to inefficiency and lethargy of the state GST officials.

""The state finance minister is making lame excuses and putting the blame on GST council instead of reforming the department under the GST regime,"" said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala before staging the walkout after speaker P Sreeramakrishnan denied leave for an adjournment motion on the issue.

The speaker rejected the notice for the motion issued by senior Congress leader V D Satheesan, based on the clarification given by finance minister T M Thomas Isaac, who said the matter could be discussed elaborately on March 10, when the House will discuss on demands for grants in the budget for the GST department. ""The department is not remaining a mere spectator as being alleged, but is carrying out inspections in shops, and the government might take stricter measures like deploying officials at shops during business hours,"" he said.

Raising the issue, Satheesan pointed out that the state's tax revenue from gold market in 2017 under VAT regime was Rs 750 crore, though the VAT was 1.25% under a compounding system. ""The tax on gold increased to 3% under GST and the state was to receive Rs 1,800 crore in 2018-19. But we received only Rs 200 crore,"" he pointed out.

But, there are also those who aren’t privileged with these options. I think when kids understand this, that too would make a difference. Also, until you face the exams, you would be constantly stressed out.

What’s going to matter in the future is how they handle life’s situations and the understanding that fear and courage go hand in hand. It also matters whether they have given their best. If the result isn’t great even after that, it’s not something they should take the blame for as it was beyond their control.

Board exam should be given like any other exams in school: Gopi Sunder, composer

Often, parents inflate the importance of Class 10 exams, from the time they are first graders and are told pathaam class jayikkanam. This would scare them, well in advance. They don’t try enough to find children’s talents. Many things, like the kind of mathematics you learn in school, is not even applied in real life.

My own life is an example of how you can be successful if you do things that make you happy. When I didn’t complete my Class 10, I was only worried about my parents. But, I started off my career at the age of 16, which is much earlier than my peers, which helped me reach where I am now.

I would say one must look at the Class 10 exam like any other examination, say, a Class 9 exam. One must also nurture what a child is interested in and show them the way.

Everyone will discover their inherent ability, growing up: Anees Salim, writer

I stopped studying after Class 11. Looking back, I consider it my best decision.

However, I don’t want it to influence anyone, including my own son. The road to getting my works published wasn’t easy. I wanted to write in English, but my education was in Malayalam medium.

t was a risk, considering that I was just beginning to explore the world of books. It was a brave decision, and it could have gone either way.

I won’t advice anyone to stop education to be something. As for today’s pressure, I tell my son to relax, do what he can and not compare himself to anyone. I’m sure everyone has an inherent ability and as you grow, one might discover that. That’s what I want to tell everyone. I would also like to tell the parents that the biggest let down children can experience is comparing them to others.

Children should study for themselves: Nisha Sarang, actor

Back in our times, we did not face this much pressure, though parents were concerned back then too. I was staying in my paternal house, when I was in Class 10, and because of that I was never put through tense situations. Even after my exams, I never felt or regretted that I should have studied more, as a majority of the excellent students are now confined to being housewives. That said, if an adult is well educated, he or she could transfer the knowledge to their children. Parents should love their children and give them the needed facilities, while at the same time make them aware of the difficulties one is in, as a family. They must be taught about their family atmosphere, but not pressurize them. Personally, I have never gone behind my children saying, ‘Padik padik’. As long as they have a goal, and you keep thinking about it and working towards the same, you will study. Study for you own selves, not for your parents or anybody. When you keep comparing yourselves to others, what you get won’t be the right one. Rather than going on a curvy lane, focus on the straight path, and you will get what you have to.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Congress has lodged a complaint with speaker P Sreeramakrishnan against the remarks made by industry minister E P Jayarajan in the assembly on Tuesday.

BENGALURU: A 19-year-old II PU student and his friend were arrested for circulating physics question paper on WhatsApp and other social media platforms in Vijayapura district's Indi town on Wednesday.

Second-year PU exams started across Karnataka on Wednesday, recording an attendance of more than four lakh students.

PU student Murughendra R Hiremath, who appeared for the physics paper at Shanteshwar Pre-University College, allegedly showed the question paper to his friend Bhagappa Sagar who was standing near the exam-hall window. Sagar reportedly clicked pictures of the paper and circulated it online.

Copies of II PU physics question paper began doing the rounds on social media platforms within one hour of commencement of the exam on Wednesday.

The department of preuniversity education (DPUE), however, denied it was a case of question paper leak, saying it was out only an hour after the exam began.

The incident took place at Shanteshwar Pre-University College at Indi town, Vijayapura district, where a student, Murughendra R Hiremath, 19, sitting near the window in the exam hall, allegedly showed the question paper to his friend, Bhagappa Sagar, who stood outside the building. Sagar is suspected to have clicked the photos and shared them on WhatsApp and other social media platforms.

Murughendra and Sagar were arrested and the former was barred from appearing for any exam. Vijayapura deputy commissioner YS Patil said Sagar climbed the 15-ft high college compound from the backside, where no security personnel was present. “He climbed the wall and stood outside the hall where his friend Murughendra was writing the exam. He clicked pictures of the physics question paper on his cellphone, and soon they went viral on social media,” Patil said.

The officer said seven other candidates at the same centre were debarred from the exam on Wednesday for other reasons.

Not a leak: DPUE director

M Kanagavalli, director, DPUE, said the duo’s real intention will be probed, but it was a clear case of malpractice to create nuisance. “We got in touch with the DC and SP of the area. An inquiry will be conducted, but I must clarify this is not a leak,” she stressed, adding Murughendra will not be allowed to sit for any more exams.

Kanagavalli said that Sagar and Murughendra have been arrested under Section 24(A) of the Karnataka Education Act. It deals with ‘prohibition of leakage of question paper’ and reads: “No person shall, during or after question paper setting, printing, custody and transportation either before or during exam, cause leakage of question paper or indulge in malpractice by various methods (buying, selling, etc).”

DPUE issued a circular on the incident and said strict action will be taken against those involved. Security at exam centres will be beefed up for the upcoming papers.

4.8L kids write exams; 8 cases of malpractice

II PU exams kicked off across the state on Wednesday, recording an attendance of 4.8 lakh students. Exams were held for three subjects: History, physics and basic maths. According to some students, the physics paper was easier than expected, while history was lengthy.

More than 1.9 lakh students appeared for the physics paper, while nearly 4,000 were absent. Nearly 2.7 lakh wrote the history paper; about 4,600 remained absent. Only 25 of the 8,002 students who applied for basic maths gave the exam a miss.

Eight cases of malpractice were reported from Vijayapura district other than the alleged paper leak. The exams, which will be taken by approximately 6.7 lakh students, will end on March 23.

In the latest order issued by the general administration department, the first phase will be from May 1 to May 30, and it will include house listing and housing census. This will include the condition of houses that covers the types as per construction, ownership status, number of rooms, details of main source of drinking water, households by main source of lighting, households by availability of latrines, etc. However, the order has also specified that no NPR data will be collected as decided earlier.

The state government had stayed all activities connected with the updation of NPR on December 20 last year, in congruence with the state government's anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) approach. Citing fears that NPR would make easy the implementation of NRC, the state government had announced that it will not cooperate at all with steps to update NPR.

""Considering apprehensions among the general public about the conduct of NPR-related activities would lead to national register of citizens (NRC) in the wake of CAA 2019, the state government orders to stay all activities connected with the updation of NPR in the state,"" the order suspending the NPR had said.

This upcoming phase will be followed by the second phase, wherein population enumeration will be held between February 9 and 28, 2021.

The state government's previous order kickstarting the census had entrusted district collector in each district as the as the principal census officer.

NAVI MUMBAI: An offshore company owned by the family of three-time BJP MLA Suresh Khade from Miraj in Sangli district has been fined Rs 25 crore for violating environment rules. DAS Offshore Engineering Pvt Ltd in CBD/Belapur has been executing a shipyard project at Rohini village, Mhasla taluka , Raigad. Supreme Court dismissed the company’s plea, by upholding an NGT order. A local resident had moved a civil court in Alibaug and then NGT. NGT’s penalty was upheld by SC.

DAS Offshore, which is into fabrication of offshore structures, is owned by the Khades.

Petitioner Naim Hasware had moved Alibaug civil court in 2014, seeking a direction to stop DAS Offshore’s project for violating environment norms. The civil court had transferred the matter to NGT-west zone bench, Pune. NGT on December 24, 2014, had penalised the company Rs 25 crore (Rs 5 crore to MCZMA for mangrove plantation and Rs 20 crore to state environment department for development of environment programme) citing the environment clearance as illegal. NGT rejected the petitioner’s plea for restoration of land to its original form, citing more harm to the environment.

The petitioner’s counsel, Rajesh Joshi, said, “The company had not obtained environment clearance from MoEF, central government. But the company obtained permission from Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB) and went ahead with the shipyard.”

DAS Offshore MD Ramakant Gupte said, “After depositing 50% of the fine amount, our company moved SC. Our company’s plea was dismissed by SC.”

HONG KONG: Hong Kong carrier Cathay Pacific has been fined HK$5 million by Britain's privacy watchdog over a huge data leak of more than nine million customers including passport numbers and credit card details.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said in a statement on Wednesday it has ordered the airline to pay 500,000 dollars for ""failing to protect the security of its customers' personal data"".

Between October 2014 and May 2019, a lack of security measures on the carrier's computer systems led to a massive data breach involving 9.4 million customers around the world -- including 111,578 from the UK -- according to the ICO.

""People rightly expect when they provide their personal details to a company, that those details will be kept secure to ensure they are protected from any potential harm or fraud,"" Steve Eckersley, ICO Director of Investigations said.

""That simply was not the case here."" He added that multiple serious deficiencies they found ""fell well below"" standard and the airline failed to satisfy four out of five of the National Cyber Security Centre's basic guidance.

The Hong Kong-based airline in October 2018 admitted that about 860,000 passport numbers, 245,000 Hong Kong identity card numbers, 403 expired credit card numbers and 27 credit card numbers with no card verification value (CVV) were accessed.

""It's time to give our public health experts and healthcare professionals the surge resources they need at this challenging time.""The agreement came together after Pelosi, D-Calif., dropped a demand, opposed by Republicans and the drug industry, to guarantee that any vaccines and drug treatments developed with government-backed research — but manufactured by drug companies — be offered at ""affordable"" prices. Pelosi opted to avoid a confrontation that could have delayed the legislation's path through Congress.Instead, more than $3 billion would be dedicated to research and development on vaccines, medicines for treatment, and diagnostic tests, including $300 million for the government to purchase such drugs from manufacturers at ""fair and reasonable"" prices to distribute them to those who need it — which is the standard applied in earlier crises like the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak.It also would provide more than $2 billion to help federal, state and local governments prepare for and respond to the coronavirus threat, including $300 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's rapid response fund. Another $1.3 billion would be used to help fight the virus overseas.Almost $1 billion would provide medical supplies and other preparedness steps: $350 million to aggressively go after the virus in ""hot spots"" like Washington state; $500 million to buy drugs, masks and other medical supplies for states, local governments and hospitals; and $100 million for community health centers. It would devote $500 million to Medicare for remote ""telehealth"" consultations that would permit sick people to get treatment without visiting a doctor.""This robust, bipartisan agreement goes far above the President's totally inadequate request to actually meet the needs we are hearing from our states and will help ensure tests and vaccines are available to everyone who needs them,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.The legislation comes as the outbreak in the US appears increasingly likely to affect workers who would be instructed to stay home, immigrants who may fear seeking treatment because they are in the US illegally, and homeless people. Widespread school closures are possible as well.""The American people are apprehensive about the spread of the coronavirus in the US and abroad. Global financial markets are on edge,"" said Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Appropriations Committee. ""Both are resilient, but vigorous action is needed to calm nerves, stabilize the situation, and get our arms around this crisis.""Vice President Mike Pence , who is coordinating the administration's response, returned to the Capitol Wednesday afternoon to separately brief House Democrats and Republicans, winning praise from both sides.""The vice president is trying to be as calming as he can and frankly his comments for the most part ... his comments seem to be pretty well aligned with where we are on this,"" said Ren Dan Kildee, D-Mich.Also Wednesday, top congressional leaders met to discuss what additional steps may be needed to ensure the safety of the Capitol complex — for lawmakers and staff, as well as the annual influx of visitors this spring.Afterward, Pelosi said it was a ""good, positive meeting about unity, and how we want to protect the Capitol and have continuity of operations for the Congress."" Asked whether the Capitol and its visitors center and galleries will remain open, Pelosi said, ""Yes, at this time yes.""Wednesday's developments also included a move by the Department of Health and Human Services to provide and initial $35 million in aid to 28 states and localities to help their public health departments respond to the outbreak and increase their surveillance for the virus.Washington state, which has seen 10 deaths, will get $2.75 million, while California will get $4.5 million. The money should be available to the states by early next week, federal officials said, and comes from more than $135 million that HHS Secretary Alex Azar transferred from other department accounts to help with the coronavirus response.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74488182,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-435380,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-house-passes-bipartisan-8-3bn-bill-to-battle-coronavirus/articleshow/74488203.cms
466,['5/03/2020'],BJP plans outreach events to mark three years of Yogi Adityanath govt,"Representative image

LUCKNOW: UP BJP will organise programmes at booth level between March 19 and 24 to mark the completion of three years of Yogi Adityanath government. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting presided over by UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and organisational secretary Sunil Bansal at BJP headquarters on Wednesday.

BJP’s move to unleash its foot soldiers to reach out to people comes in the backdrop of party’s efforts to take on the opposition ahead of 2022 assembly elections.

The party leadership has also decided to hold meetings of district-level working committees, an exercise essentially to assess the political situation at the ground level. Leaders also chalked out party’s strategy for panchayat and cooperative society elections.

“The party has decided to reach out to people and apprise them about the achievements of the Yogi Adityanath government,” Singh said. The booth-level campaign is similar to Gram Swaraj Abhiyan by the party last year in which leaders and ministers were asked to camp in villages and help people get the benefit of government schemes.

“The government has been driven by the promises made by the party in its ‘Sankalp Patra’ (manifesto) ahead of 2017 elections,” Singh said, adding that the government was working for all sections of the society including youths, farmers and socio-economically backward.

“The government has been working on issues related to education, health, housing, women, youth and Dalits. It also ensured a robust law and order situation besides policies for farmers,” the UP BJP chief said.

468,['5/03/2020'],Trade impact of coronavirus epidemic for India estimated at $348 million: UN report,"UNITED NATIONS: The trade impact of the coronavirus epidemic for India is estimated to be about $348 million and the country figures among the top 15 economies most affected as slowdown of manufacturing in China disrupts world trade, according to a UN report.Estimates published by United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Wednesday said that the slowdown of manufacturing in China due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is disrupting world trade and could result in a 50 billion dollar decrease in exports across global value chains.The most affected sectors include precision instruments, machinery, automotive and communication equipment.Among the most affected economies are the European Union ($15.6 billion), the United States ($5.8 billion), Japan ($5.2 billion), South Korea ($3.8 billion), Taiwan Province of China ($2.6 billion) and Vietnam ($2.3 billion).India is among the 15 most affected economies due to the coronavirus epidemic and slow down in production in China, with a trade impact of $348 million.The trade impact for India is less as compared to other economies such as EU, the US, Japan and South Korea. Trade impact for Indonesia is $312 million.For India, the trade impact is estimated to be the most for the chemicals sector at $129 million, textiles and apparel at $64 million, automotive sector at $34 million, electrical machinery at $12 million, leather products at $13 million, metals and metal products at $27 million and wood products and furniture at $15 million.“Besides its worrying effects on human life, the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has the potential to significantly slowdown not only the Chinese economy but also the global economy. China has become the central manufacturing hub of many global business operations. Any disruption of China's output is expected to have repercussions elsewhere through regional and global value chains,” UNCTAD said.Over the last month, China has seen a dramatic reduction in its manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) to 37.5, its lowest reading since 2004.This drop implies a 2 per cent reduction in output on an annual basis. This has come as a direct consequence of the spread of corona virus (COVID-19).“The 2 per cent contraction in China's output has ripple effects through the global economy and thus far has caused an estimated drop of about $50 billion across countries,""UNCTAD said.""The most affected sectors include precision instruments, machinery, automotive and communication equipment,” it added.UNCTAD said because China has become the central manufacturing hub of many global business operations, a slowdown in Chinese production has repercussions for any given country depending on how reliant its industries are on Chinese suppliers.“In addition to grave threats to human life, the coronavirus outbreak carries serious risks for the global economy,” UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi said.“Any slowdown in manufacturing in one part of the world will have a ripple effect in economic activity across the globe because of regional and global value chains,” he said.Pamela Coke-Hamilton, who heads UNCTAD's Division on International Trade and Commodities, said for developing economies that are reliant on selling raw materials, the effects could be felt “very, very intensely.”“Assuming that it is not mitigated in the short-term, it's likely that the overall impact on the global economy is going to be significant in terms of a negative downturn,” she said.The estimated global effects of COVID-19 are subject to change depending on the containment of the virus and or changes in the sources of supply.Meanwhile, the extent of the damage to the global economy caused by novel coronavirus COVID-19 moved further into focus as UN economists announced a likely $50 billion drop in worldwide manufacturing exports in February alone.Highlighting the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of the epidemic, in which there have been more than 90,000 confirmed cases in more than 70 countries (the majority in China) and over 3,000 deaths, Coke-Hamilton said that US measures “in terms of visitor arrivals, cancelling various meetings” were having a “knock-on effect” in terms of demand.“So right now, we're not clear on where it will go – a lot will depend on what happens with COVID-19; if they are able to come up with a vaccine then hallelujah, hopefully it will end very quickly, but if not, the impact can be severe,” she said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74488191,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-204394,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/trade-impact-of-coronavirus-epidemic-for-india-estimated-at-348-million-un-report/articleshow/74487999.cms

AHMEDABAD: A 21-year-old woman was held by cybercrime cell of the city police for displaying another woman’s picture on her instragram profile. The woman also changed the name of the Instagram ID. Police sources said she did this as the complainant woman, 25, looked pretty, and the accused wanted to increase her followers by using the other woman’s image as her own.

Inspector S D Sadat of cybercrime police station said the complainant woman works as a nurse in a private hospital and she had approached them last December. She had stated that some unknown person was using her name and picture in a fake Instagram profile. She also stated that her reputation was at risk as that unknown person could upload something objectionable on the fake ID.

“We lodged a case under Section 66 C of the IT act against the accused and wrote to service providers to give us the IP address of the device from which the fake Instagram ID was created,” Sadat.

Cybercrime police sources said that after getting the IP log of the device they approached the accused. “At first, the woman denied having made the fake ID, but broke down when faced with proof,” Sadat said.

“The accused, who has studied only up to Class X, said she found the complainant so beautiful that she took a screenshot of her profile photo and created afake Instagram ID with it to increase her followers,” an investigator said.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Law minister A K Balan , on Wednesday, said in the assembly that the government will not take any decision of its own in introducing reservation in private sector jobs. The government will hold discussions with all concerned organisations on this issue.

The SNDP had already extended their support in handing over all appointments under their institutions to the state public service commission. But the government is yet to take a decision.

The review is held every January for the special recruitment and the reservation is not lost during the promotions. For the SC, ST category, the government has ensured that the reservation opportunities are not lost for them. If at all there are any complaints on this, the government will soon rectify it, the minister said, adding that due to the financial crisis faced by the state there is a delay in disbursing the benefits for the SC and ST category. This has also affected the ongoing construction of Ambedkar colonies. The government had taken over 309 colonies and out of this, construction of 29 colonies have been completed.

'Govt will act against Muthoot management'

Labour minister T P Ramakrishnan said the government will take action against the management of Muthoot Group of Companies for violating labour laws and denying right to organise and freedom of opinion of employees. The government will take action against the management as per labour laws, the minister said.

While travellers booked for Singapore, Thailand and other southeast Asian destinations had started to drop out earlier, agents said that trips to the UK, US and Europe too are now being taken off the table.

""Today (Wednesday) I cancelled multiple bookings to Italy and London. In the last few days, I have cancelled 85 to 90% of my packages. Even our regular clients have put their plans on hold,"" said Abdul Majid Faheem, chairman, Travel Agents Federation of India (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana). ""Apart from those travelling for corporate events, nobody else is willing to go overseas now. We have cancelled holiday trips for March and April,"" he said.

Other local agents reported similar trends. ""In February we got enquiries from customers planning visits to Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Bali and Thailand. But all those people have cancelled their trips,"" said an official from Hyderabad Tours and Travels.

Some travellers that TOI spoke to said they are apprehensive about air travel. ""Given the situation, travelling in an aircraft with over 100 people, might not be a safe choice at the moment. So, we decided to postpone our plan,"" said a banker, Pallavi T, who had booked tickets for Dubai this weekend.

While agents are witnessing cancellations on the domestic circuit too, the situation isn't as alarming, they say. In fact, ahead of International Women's Day and Holi, many are travelling to places like Hampi, Goa, Alappuzha among others.

He was speaking at ‘Lok Mein Ram ’ Mahotsava which was inaugurated here on Wednesday. The three-day event will witness deliberations on the persona of Lord Ram by artists, painters and performers from different parts of India.

The event is being jointly organised by Ram Manohar Lohia Avadh University , notfor-profit cultural organisation Sanskar Bharti and UP culture department’s Ayodhya Shodh Sansthan.

In the welcome address, folk artist Malini Awasthi said: “The purpose of this initiative is to introduce the legacy of Lord Ram to millennial children who ultimately shoulder the responsibility of keeping the tradition alive.”

Chief guest and former Goa governor Mridula Sinha said: “The moment someone remembers Ram by singing a folk song or reciting Ramayana in America, his heart and mind travels to Ayodhya. The bond, which is beyond time and space, makes Ram truly universal.”

Proposing the vote of thanks, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Avadh University vice-chancellor Manoj Dixit said: “The freedom embodied in the persona of Ram is immense. The event has given a platform to diverse perceptions of the deity.”

476,['5/03/2020'],Bengal rejoices as NFAI acquires rare footage of Jyotish Banerjee’s banned silent-era film,"A still from 'Madhabi Kankan'

Kolkata: Of the 1,350 silent-era films produced in India, only 30 were known to have survived. But on March 4, National Film Archive of India ( NFAI ) announced that they had acquired rare footage of ‘ Madhabi Kankan ’ aka ‘Slave Girl of Agra’, a silent-era film directed by Kolkata’s Jyotish Banerjee of ‘Manmoyee Girls’ School’ fame. While the discovery takes the number of surviving silent-era films to 31, it is also a significant find, given that it is the first among the films made by Banerjee under the banner of Madan Theatres Limited of Kolkata that has been recovered.Banerjee had joined as a typist at the Madan Theatres and later went on to become the studio’s main film-maker in the silent era. He adapted several novels of Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay and plays by Girish Ghosh and Rabindra Mohan Moitra. An example of the Bengali literary film genre, his ‘Madhabi Kankan’ was an adaptation of Romesh Chunder Dutt ’s historical novel starring Mumtaz Begum, Lalita Devi, Nawab, Bhanu Bannerjee, Leelavati, Jainarayan Mukherjee and Farida Begum. The novel explores the story of tripartite love. It is written against a historical background. Narendra and Hemnalini love each other. But she is married to Shrish Chandra while Narendra joins the Mughal army. Jelekha, a Tartar slave girl in the Mughal harem, falls in love with Narendra and pursues him. The Filmland Magazine of 1933 makes note of the film and writes: “If not for any other merits, this picture certainly claims a high place for its superb locations”.Prakash MagdumThis is Banerjee’s first silent era film to have survived. According to film historian Virchand Dharamsey, “This film was initially banned, re-censored and released in 1932. There could have been political and/or religious reasons for that. I have seen the footage and I feel the performance of Nawab in the role of Shah Jahan was remarkable.” Shot by two foreign technicians Charles Creed and Marconi, the film revolves around the events in the 17th century when Mughal emperor Shah Jahan’ sons fight for the throne. The surviving footage has the characters of Shuja and Jahan Ara along with Shah Jahan.According to film scholar Sanjoy Mukhopadhyay , this recovery is huge in the history of Indian cinema. “It was brave to make a film adaption exploring an inter-religious love story with Mughal history as the backdrop in 1930. During that time, a film based on Bankim’s Rajsingha by Madan Theatre was also banned. That film has been lost. It is significant that another film of the same gharana and from that era has been recovered by NFAI,” Mukhopadhyay pointed out.During the silent era, three major film production houses — Madan Theatres, Dadasaheb Phalke’s Hindustan Cinema Films Company and Dwarkadas Sampat’s Kohinoor Film Company — made some 1,350 films in India. “While we have some elements of the other production houses, nothing had survived from Madan Theatres though it was the biggest producer and distributor during those days,” NFAI director Prakash Magdum said.In 2016, NFAI had acquired 594 metres long footage (run time 28 minutes) of Rustom Dotiwala’s ‘ Bilwamangal ’ from Cinematheque Francaise — the Paris-based film organization which holds one of the largest archives of cinema in the world. Produced by Elphinstone Bioscope Company in Kolkata (the earlier avatar of Madan Theatres) with Bengali intertitles, ‘Bilwamangal’ is credited as the first Bengali feature film. When the footage of ‘Bilwamangal’ was discovered, the search for other footage began worldwide. Magdum himself paid three visits to Cinematheque Francaise before this footage was recovered. The 13-minute-long footage has been digitised by NFAI. “Anyone keen on seeing it can come to the archive. At a later point of time, we can put it up on our portal. As of now, the film does not have credits or inter-titles. That’s how it used to work in the silent era. We are in touch with film historians in this regard so that things can be in order for a proper screening,” Magdum said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74487806,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-201195,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-rejoices-as-nfai-acquires-rare-footage-of-jyotish-banerjees-banned-silent-era-film/articleshow/74487741.cms
477,['5/03/2020'],Anxious parents could feel jealous of the first baby,"Relationships are complex and can turn more complex with the addition of a new child. According to a new study, researchers have said that couples should address relationship anxiety before the first baby is born as a new child can spark feelings of jealousy in a person who already fears being abandoned by his or her partner.The study was published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships. It found that partners who showed signs of relationship anxiety before the birth of their first child were more likely to be jealous of the child after it was born.""You might think, who could be jealous of a baby? But if you already have fears of rejection, it may be scary to see how much attention your partner showers on your new child,"" said study lead author Anna Olsavsky from Ohio State University in the US.The baby also induced a feeling of declined satisfaction after becoming parents, if either partner was jealous of the baby.For the findings, the research team used data from the New Parents Project, a long-term study co-led by Schoppe-Sullivan that is investigating how dual-earner couples adjust to becoming parents for the first time. In all, 182 couples, most of whom were married, participated in this study.During the third trimester of pregnancy, mothers and fathers completed a variety of questionnaires, including one that examined ""attachment anxiety.""According to the research, they were asked how much they agreed with statements like ""I'm afraid that I will lose my partner's love"" and ""I worry about being abandoned.""Three months after their baby was born, the couples completed a measure of jealousy of the partner-infant relationship. They reported how much they agreed with statements like ""I resent it when my spouse/partner is more affectionate with our baby than s/he is with me.""As they predicted, the researchers found that people with relationship anxiety before the child's birth were more jealous of the child three months after arrival.But it wasn't just the anxious partner who felt jealous of the baby - even their spouses felt higher levels of jealousy, they added.The reason may be that spouses of anxious partners are used to receiving a lot of attention from their partner, and that responsiveness may lessen when the baby arrives, the study said.""It is not just that you aren't receiving all the attention that you used to receive, but also that the child is receiving that extra devotion that once was given to you,"" Schoppe-Sullivan said.The researchers went into the study believing that anxious fathers may be most vulnerable to feeling jealousy of the new child because dads tend to spend less time with infants than moms do. But that's not what they found.Interestingly, the study also revealed that moms and dads who suffered from anxiety, were more equally likely to be jealous of the time their partners spent with the new baby.

The varification report can take around 15 days time, said a forest official.

We asked Anirban how much the industry has changed lately and the dashing actor says it has changed for the better“I believe in the next five years, it will evolve further. Who knew in the late-’90s that Bengali cinema could be better than those commercial potboilers? Young filmmakers like Srijit and others have brought a whiff of fresh air, and audiences have discovered their appetite for thrillers. I believe, people value trained actors like us a lot more than they did. And it’s because content has gone through a sea change. If you look at current national or Bollywood trends, you will observe that all medium- or small-budget movies that are hitting the bulls eye are based on small-town stories. People want to see their stories on-screen, and that’s why semi-urban plots work so well,” explains Anirban who will soon be seen in Debaloy Bhattacharya ’s ‘Dracula Sir’.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74488296,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-84984/74488296.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/bengali/movies/news/anirban-reflects-on-how-the-industry-has-evolved-lately/articleshow/74488316.cms
482,['5/03/2020'],Supreme Court refuses to allow Delhi violence victim intervene in hate speech case of activist Harsh Mander,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to allow a victim of the recent Delhi violence to intervene in a matter in which the Centre has raised the issue of alleged hate speeches by activist Harsh Mander during anti-CAA protests.

Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves mentioned the matter before a bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde and said the riot victim wanted to intervene in the Harsh Mander case, which is scheduled to be heard on Friday.

""We will not allow you to intervene,"" Bobde told the advocate.

Gonsalves said he had seen the video of an alleged hate speech by Mander and wanted to place it on record.

""We had asked the solicitor general to put it (video of alleged hate speech by Mander) on record. We don't need you in that proceeding,"" the Chief Justice of India (CJI) said.

When Gonsalves said he had appeared for Mander before the high court in the Delhi violence matter, the bench said, ""You can appear for him here also.""

The Delhi Police had on Wednesday filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court against Mander and sought initiation of contempt proceedings against him for alleged ""derogatory remarks"" making insinuations against the apex court and its judges.

The affidavit was filed after the Centre's allegation before the Supreme Court that Mander, who has sought registering of FIRs against some BJP leaders for their alleged hate speeches that purportedly led to the violence in Delhi, himself had made certain objectionable remarks against the top court, ""majesty of law"", the government and Parliament.

The Supreme Court had taken strong note of the Centre's allegations and not only refused to hear Mander's counsel Karuna Nundy till the issue of his alleged hate speech is ""sorted"", but also kept his petition to itself while transferring other pleas related to the violence to the Delhi High Court .

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had referred to some of the alleged hate speeches delivered by Mander during the anti-CAA protests and at the Jamia Millia Islamia on December 16 last year.

He had read out in court certain excerpts from alleged speeches of Mander and said they included objectionable statements about the apex court, Parliament and the government.

The apex court, in May least year, had come down heavily on Mander for seeking recusal of the then CJI from hearing his PIL saying it would not allow anybody to ""browbeat"" and ""damage the institution"".

The then CJI Ranjan Gogoi had struck off Mander's name as the petitioner and had rather appointed his lawyer Prashant Bhushan as the amicus curiae in the case.

484,['5/03/2020'],"After 2 weeks of pounding, 'Leaning Tower of Dallas' is down","DALLAS: The Leaning Tower of Dallas , the nearly iconic remnant of a high-rise building implosion gone awry, finally collapsed in a cloud of dust Monday after two weeks of being whacked with a headache ball.

The tower collapsed about 3:15 p.m. after a few last whacks with a wrecking ball swung by a high-rise crane. No injuries were reported.

The tower was the core of an 11-story building that was imploded with explosives on Feb. 16. The 11 floors surrounding the core duly collapsed, but the solid concrete core containing the stairway and elevator shafts remained standing at an angle. The demolition contractor has been whacking away at it ever since with a 5,600-pound wrecking ball.

A spokeswoman for De La Vega Development , which is redeveloping the site, had said immediately after the implosion that the tower’s demolition could take up to four days. It ended up taking almost four times that amount of time before it was taken down.

In the meantime, the tower drew hundreds of people who took often-whimsical photographs of themselves with the tower in the background.

486,['5/03/2020'],Schoolteachers must introspect on anti-national slogans in universities: Yogi Adityanath,"LUCKNOW: Putting the onus of nation building on teachers, chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Wednesday that if anti-national slogans are raised on university campuses then teachers at primary and basic education levels need to introspect and assess what had they taught them that they are now backstabbing their motherland.

Addressing the inaugural ceremony of a two-day seminar —Mission Prerna & CSR conclave in Lucknow, CM Yogi asked, “Who is responsible for violence on campuses and for those who are raising anti-national slogans on campus?”

Such incidents reflect badly on education standards and call for making an assessment as to what type of education was imparted to the students at primary and secondary levels, he said.

“Teachers have a big role in shaping the society and future of country. A good teacher is first a good student who keeps learning throughout life,” said Yogi.

Alluding to complaints of teachers being involved in other work, Yogi said, “If teachers are assigned population census duty, they should not be reluctant, rather they should take it as an opportunity to form a social connect and develop a better understanding of people and society. They can understand from what financial status are their students coming.”

He said one of the biggest challenges was the problem of proxy teachers. “Some were not coming to schools and were sending others to teach on their behalf by paying them from salary. If teachers don’t come to school than how can students be expected. Strict action solved this problem,” said Yogi. He said another challenge in front of his government was to improve infrastructure in schools and was done to big extent through ‘Kayakalp’ scheme.

Under the scheme, infrastructure of 92,000 of 1,58,000 primary schools was upgraded and smart classes, toilets, clean drinking water, been provided. He also inaugurated the upgradation of 350 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas from class VIII to class XII.

Yogi also launched two online learning and monitoring applications, ‘Samarthya’ — for differentially abled students of 6 to 14 age group — and ‘Sharda’ for increasing student enrolment.

KOCHI: The high court on Wednesday sought a report from the state government on the death of 33 inmates of a psychiatric hospital within a span of eight years.

Justice Sathish Ninan directed Kottayam district collector to file a report within two weeks regarding the deaths. The report should include the actions taken by the government since the deaths came to light, the court has ordered.

The court's interference came after the amicus curiae assisting in cases related to mental health issues brought the incident to the attention of the bench.

The deaths were revealed in an inquiry conducted by the jurisdictional ADM, Anil Oommen, following the deaths of three of the inmates of Puthujeevan psychiatric hospital at Kottamuri in Changanassery. The ADM had inspected the registers of the institution since 2012, which led to the discovery of the deaths. Of the deceased, 16 persons were below 60 years of age.

After noting that the deaths could also include suicides and age-related deaths, the ADM had recommended for a detailed probe, including scrutinizing of chemical analysis reports.

Of the three deaths within a week, the first was that of a 44-year-old woman on February 23. She complained of uneasiness and of paralysis later on, prior to her death. Two more inmates died of similar symptoms within a week while seven more inmates had to be hospitalized for treatment with symptoms such as swelling on legs, difficulty in breathing, and drop in blood pressure.

Anushka Shetty to tie the knot with her ‘Size Zero’ director Prakash Kovelamudi?,"Lady Superstar of Tollywood and a darling among the masses, Anushka Shetty is among the few actresses in the country who can carry the entire film on their shoulders.

Be it a period drama, suspense-thriller or a romantic comedy, the 38-year-old diva has proved her mettle time and time again with her solid acting chops and arresting screen-presence.Meanwhile, the never-ending speculations on Anushka’s marriage have once again grabbed the limelight on social media.

BENGALURU: There has been an increase in the number of people with cold, cough and other flu-like symptoms in the city and many are worried that their condition could be linked to coronavirus, doctors said.

They and their family members have been ringing up hospitals and clinics seeking tests for Covid-19.

Dr Anoop Amarnath, chief of clinical services at Manipal Hospitals said flu-like cases and respiratory infections had gone up by 15% in the past week. “However, there are standard protocols and criteria for screening and testing. Guidelines of the World Health Organization and the government of India state that testing can be done only if the person has developed respiratory issues and has a travel history involving affected countries. Tests are also done if the person was exposed to a confirmed Covid-19 case,” he said.

Hospitals in the city have been counselling anxious citizens who suspect they have symptoms of the disease. Doctors at the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD) said several people, with no history of travel to affected countries or exposure to a confirmed case, were turning up complaining of cold and cough.

Dr Deepak Balani, chief of medical services at Sakra World Hospital said it had received some cases of influenza. “Every day now, we get 20 to 40 patients who suspect they might be infected with the coronavirus. The fears are unjustified; no one has tested positive yet,” he said.

The number of H1N1, or influenza A, cases in BBMP limits has gone up. According to the state health and family welfare department, 109 cases were reported between January 1 and March 4. During the same period, the state recorded 256 cases. Three deaths have been reported, one each in Tumakuru, Bengaluru Rural and Davanagere.

“When winter ends, respiratory infections like H1N1 surge. Cases of flu-like symptoms, viral infection and even bacterial infections are commonly seen in outpatient units. There is a fear in the public, and it should be allayed through proper information. Most people read something in social media and become worried,” said Dr Jyothsna Krishnappa, an internal medicine specialist at Apollo Hospitals.

Every day, four to five people, who have visited one of the affected countries, report at Fortis Hospital, Bannerghatta Road seeking Covid-19 test.

“Most of them are sent by corporate companies, which want their employees to obtain a fitness certificate. But as per the guidelines, despite the travel history, they cannot be considered for testing if they don’t have any symptoms. In such cases, I write a note saying the person is not suspected to be infected with Covid-19,” said Dr Pratheek, internal medicine testing, Fortis Hospitals.

After being turned down for Covid-19 tests at private hospitals, many seek help at RGICD. “We have set up a help desk to deal with such queries. Not all cases require testing,” an official said.

497,['5/03/2020'],Church mag flays MP over 'love jihad',"Representative image

THRISSUR: Thrissur archdiocese-owned newsletter has criticized Chalakkudy MP Benny Behanan over his query in Parliament on the 'love jihad ' issue. The monthly newsletter 'Katholicasabha' alleges that Behanan has vested interests behind his Parliament query.

""The article 'Love Jihad: Ammamarude Kanniranu telivukal (Love jihad: Mothers' tears are the proof)' alleges that the proof of love jihad in the state are the tears of mothers who have lost their daughters to conversions. In Syro-Malabar Church many girls converted to Islam and some girls were sent to ISIS,"" said the church publication.

""Behanan who won the elections with votes of Christians has now turned against them. We suspect that the MP has vested interests for raising the question in the Lok Sabha. After Behanan's query the anti-Church gangs and media are targeting the Church,"" the publication said.

KCBC official spokesperson Fr Varghese Vallikkat said, ""We dont know what Behanan's motive was. Many political parties raised voice against love jihad. But Congress has not raised voice over the issue. It shows that the party needs to protect those behind the issue.""

Love jihad is a reality but Congress and its MP were unaware of the incidents, he added.

However, Behanan clarified, ""There was no vested interest behind my query in Parliament. We wanted to know details. I do not wish to create a controversy over the article in the Church's publication.""
