0,['25/03/2020'],Sandalwood celebs moot low key celebrations for Ugadi this time,"Ugadi, which marks the new year in Kannadiga households, is about embracing it with all the sweetness and a pinch of salt. This is done, quite literally, with households having a mix of bevu and bella (neem leaves and jaggery). This year, with the COVID-19 pandemic causing a dent in the celebrations, Sandalwood’s leading ladies say that the scale of their celebration might be much lesser, but their spirits remain the same, as they look forward to a happier, healthier year.Since the shutdown, I have been at home with my family. We keep switching between watching movies, playing games and chatting. Everyday feels like an extended weekend, and I think we’ll be doing the same on Ugadi too. It is going to be yet another day spent with my family and loved ones during this quarantine.A simple puja with family this year. I was supposed to be travelling, but the lockdown has come as a blessing in disguise, as I am able to stay at home and spend time with my family, especially my grandmother, who is also here with us. While the norm is to visit a temple and do a puja, considering the current situation, we are going to keep it low key and have a simple puja at home with the traditional bevu-bella.I will donate the money I normally splurge on myself. This time of the year is doubly special for me as it has both Navratri and Ugadi. I wanted to fast for eight days and have a big ceremony on the ninth day, but that won’t happen. Instead, this year, I plan on using the time to reach out to those in need. I have already begun by donating masks and gloves.I want to make the most of the time with family. Ugadi is a time to meet everyone in the family and other loved ones. This year, though, since we are social distancing, we will not have family over at our place. We plan on making the most of our time together at home. We will have a small puja, of course, followed by a simple,traditional meal.I’ll enjoy mom’s home-cooked delicacies and relax. I’m spending Ugadi at home with my parents. My mother might cook some delicacies, which will be the extent of the festivities for us. I’ll help my mother in the kitchen, and around the house. I have also been utilising the time I’ve had at home to just relax, watch movies, read books, and pursue hobbies that have been on my to-do list for a long while. During the lock down period, my mother has been trying her hand at photography, so, I might assist her with that over Ugadi.I wish to begin the new year on a positive note I am looking at beginning the new year with a lot of positivity, as that is the need of the hour. My mother and I will have simple celebrations of the festival at home, with a traditional home-cooked meal. We realise that this year is taxing for many households, so I pray for them and hope to help them in whatever way I can.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74792135,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-129483/74792135.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/sandalwood-celebs-moot-low-key-celebrations-for-ugadi-this-time/articleshow/74792135.cms

On Monday, RK Selvamani, the president of the Federation of Film Employees of South India ( FEFSI ), had appealed to the film fraternity to extend financial help for the over 26,000 members of the body, who depend on daily wages.Angamuthu, secretary, FEFSI, says that the body needs at least `5 crores to ensure the welfare of its members. “This is in addition to the other 10,000 people who are related to cinema,” he says, adding, “Actors like Rajini, Sivakumar family, Sivakarthikeyan, Vijay Sethupathi Parthiban , Narain, Roshan, Sachu, and others like filmmaker Vetri Maaran, producer Thanu have contributed to FEFSI. We are expecting other leading stars like Kamal Haasan, Ajith and Vijay also to do their bit. FEFSI has also requested the CMO to donate. We are awaiting a favourable reply and contribution from the government’s side, too.”Following his appeal, a stream of film personalities have now contributed to the relief fund for workers, either by donating cash or rice bags. While Sivakumar, Suriya and Karthi jointly donated `10 lakh, just a few hours after RK Selvamani's request, Sivakarthikeyan also donated `10 lakh for the FEFSI members. Parthiban, Prakash Raj and Mano Bala provided rice bags weighing 25kg each respectively.

Then, when the government affected a partial shutdown, factories and other establishments that were hitherto contributing to the poor air quality of the city, scaled down operations or shut them altogether. The result — readings on the Air Quality Index (AQI) across the city, right from Hebbal to Silk Board, have been phenomenal.“The pollution load has most certainly come down over the past 10-12 days because of COVID-19 and most of the stations have recorded moderate to satisfactory air quality levels,” says Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) Member Secretary Basavaraj V Patil. Even the Krantiveera Sangolli Rayanna Railway Station, which is a problem point for the pollution control board, has shown a marked decrease in the AQI level. “From March 9 to 19, the city railway station has recorded a reduction in pollution levels, but it continues to be above 100,” he adds.According to the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB), the city’s pollution levels dropped by 40-50% on Sunday's Janta Curfew. Basavaraj, though, is not thrilled that the city’s better air quality is a result of a forced shutdown. “We need to understand that the reason behind this improvement in air quality is not good. In the interest of current and future generations, we need to look at ways to reduce the pollution load even on normal days, and not just because of a pandemic,"" he adds.Seema Mundoli, faculty at Azim Premji University for urban sustainability, agrees and adds, “It would be foolish for us to celebrate a reduction in pollution levels because of the shutdown. One would not want to pay such a huge price for reduced pollution levels. To contain the city’s increasing pollution level, we need political will and resolve, which is, unfortunately, lacking. Air pollution is a national health crisis and will require a much better thought-out strategy to combat it.”",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74792446,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-386526,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-gets-a-whiff-of-fresh-air-but-will-it-last/articleshow/74792446.cms
3,['25/03/2020'],Peepal Tree’s new album is a tribute to good old Bengaluru,"City band Peepal Tree is all set to take you on a nostalgia trip with their latest album, for which they have collaborated with music composer Sandeep Chowta . The four-song album, titled 560001, is all about Bengaluru, focusing mainly on the positive aspects of namma ooru.Speaking about the new album, Sujay Harthi, vocalist of the band, says, “Bengaluru gets a lot of flak because of its bad traffic and poor infrastructure and. So, with this new album, we want to shed light on the positives that the city offers. There are two songs about Bengaluru in the album. The first track has a folk tune, Cheluvayya Cheluvo, which a lot of people will be able to relate to immediately, while the second number is about friendship. These songs, we feel, will immediately take Bengalureans back in time.”The album, which will be released online on March 30, also features Kannada rap artist Gubbi. Sandeep, who has composed and produced the album, says, “Since the album is about good things about the city, the timing of the launch is kind of perfect, given the lockdown and situation we are currently in. The music and lyrics are essentially about the memories we share in the city.”Why the title 560001? “It’s a Kannada album and Sandeep wanted it to be a tribute to the city, where all of us have grown up here. We thought of many names. But 560001 stuck with us, because it’s the pin code of MG Road, and this neighbourhood has been a hub of culture activities for the past few decades. Be it performance arenas or popular hangouts, MG Road has been the place to be. All of us have fond memories of this area, which is why we agreed on this title,” says Sujay. Giving a little insight into the genre of the album, Sujay says, “It’s a complete deviation from the our band’s sound, which is Rock Funk. But this was not a deliberate attempt. We, too, were surprised with the outcome. Hope the audience will enjoy it.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74791808,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-184651/74791808.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/music/peepal-trees-new-album-is-a-tribute-to-good-old-bengaluru/articleshow/74791808.cms

With schools shut due to #CoronaScare, summer vacation is fast approaching, and with it come warm memories of vacation, scoops of ice cream and time in the sun. But for children , it also means summer camps . In this testing time of the Coronavirus and social distancing, however, the summertime phenomenon has become yet another casualty.

With Section 144 being imposed in Chennai, for the time being, summer courses and sports camps, too, have been cancelled. M Raghu Raman, founder of UV Global pre-school, says that the current slot of summer camps offered by his school stand cancelled. “Given the current scenario, we have cancelled the first batch which was supposed to go on till April 8. We maybe cancelling future programmes based on the circumstances. It is dampening spirits, but social distancing is something that we all need to collectively follow,” he says, adding that the children’s safety will always remain top priority.

Zinnera, from Hello Kids Butterflies, adds that the inquiries for classes have dialed down. “We had scheduled two sets of camps in April and May each. We might have to push the camp dates to some time after April 15, now, if normalcy returns. There were a few enquirers in the beginning, but now it has been completely silent,” she notes.

This camp was supposed to be her first time organising such an event. “Our lineup included arts and crafts, self-defence, storytelling and toiletry training. We are hoping for the best as that is all we can do right now,” she adds.

While business has been hit hard, it is imperative to forgo whatever the situation demands, says Gayathri, founder of city-based organisation Little Walks, who has called off a five-batched set that was to begin from April 5. “We know that it will be hard on the parents as well who would have to pay attention to every action of their children while keeping them indoors. Hence, our team recently started sending tips, single-player board game ideas, and worksheets to our parents circle via WhatsApp,” Gayathri explains.

Going digital could just be yet another solution, Raghu chimes in. “We are trying to rope in some partners to get online material like programmes on storytelling and DIY hacks, etc. We are also connecting with parents to welcome ideas from their side. Given social distancing, we should see technology as an enabler,” he adds.

Personal attention and hand-holding, however, are unique to physical summer camps, adds Saritha, from The Brainbay Edu-Spark in the city. “We engage seven students with one teacher at our camp. But online, we can spend time with less students. Personal attention will be less and time management will be difficult,” she says.

Can children, however, make do without such collectives? Camps like these are essential in the development of motor and sensory skills, says Nandini, a young mother of three-year-old Sudhiksha. “Kids today are nothing like us, 90s kids. The world is getting competitive and every child is expected to be extremely talented, which is quite challenging. Summer camps like these help in the development of basic skills,” she says.

The closure of camps also poses a challenge to working mothers like her. “It is quite difficult to keep the kids occupied. Online programmes might work for kids above five years of age. But younger children need assistance to handle devices. For now, the kids are keeping their grandparents busy,” she says with a smile.

13,['25/03/2020'],Interesting food facts you didn't know about Ugadi and Gudi Padwa,"This is the first day of the Chaitra month in the Hindu Lunisolar Calendar (the first month of the year). For people in Northern India, this day marks as the beginning of Navratri. But, do you know what it is called in South? Across Maharashtra, the day is known as Gudi Padwa and the Telugu people celebrate the New Year with Ugadi. The most beautiful and interesting thing about all the regions is, they celebrate the day with traditional foods and rituals. Here are some interesting food facts associated with Ugadi and Gudi Padwa that you probably did not know:1. They both are harvest festivals of their respective regions. The day signifies the end of one season and the beginning of another. During this period rabi crop is just harvested and the market prepares itself for mangoes.2. The day is celebrated as Navreh by Kashmiri Pandits, Cheti Chand by Sindhis and Sajibu Nongma Panba Cheiraoba in Manipur.3. In many Maharashtrian families, the day begins with the preparation of traditional dishes like Shrikhand and Puran Poli.4. On the auspicious occasion of Ugadi, an interesting and healthy concoction of six ingredients is made. If experts are to be believed, each ingredient symbolizes an emotion and is to be consumed by the family members. These ingredients and emotions are neem buds/flowers (sadness), jaggery (happiness), green chilli (anger), salt (fear), tamarind (disgust) and unripened mango (surprise).5. In Andhra Pradesh, the day is celebrated with a stuffed paratha-type dish that is called Bobbattu. It’s a traditional flatbread recipe made with refined flour, chana dal, sugar, sooji, cardamom, salt, turmeric and oil. It is called Obbattu or Holigein Karnataka. It is eaten topped with ghee or milk or even coconut milk.6. On this auspicious day, people in the Konkani region of the country prepare Kanangachi Kheer. Apet from this, they also consume boiled sweet potato, coconut milk, rice flour and jaggery in varied forms.7. In rural parts of Maharashtra, there is a ritual of making a gudi (doll) om this day. The doll is made with a bamboo stick, neem and mango leaves, red garland, with an inverted copper or silver pot for a face. After the rituals are done, the doll is placed outside the main door, for others to see.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74800472,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-757266/74800472.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/food-news/interesting-food-facts-you-didnt-know-about-ugadi-and-gudi-padwa/articleshow/74800472.cms

Going sustainable with solar energy

Harshvardhan Joshi with solar panels at Mt. Himlung Himal in Nepal

The outbreak of coronavirus Covid-19 has thrown life off kilter in more ways than you can count. The world’s major events — political , social, sports, fashion and more — have been cancelled and postponed indefinitely, in addition to schools and colleges and places of work being shut. And recently, all expeditions to Mount Everest were cancelled, just ahead of the climbing season. Harshvardhan Joshi from Mumbai, an avid climber who was to make his first attempt at scaling the mountain, chats with BT about how his big dream to scale Mount Everest will have to wait. “I have mixed feelings. I was really looking forward to climbing Mt. Everest, and at first, I was very disappointed. People around me — my parents and friends — know how much it mattered. But of course, at this point, things are not in our control. My Everest dream awaits. I will not give up on it and I hope to climb there next April,” he says.This 24-year-old IT engineer has been nurturing his dream since the last four years. He says, “In 2106, I decided that I would attempt Everest. It’s something I have been cherishing.” From the word go, it involved a plot of planning, prep and effort. He affirms, “Every summer, in these last few years, I stay in the Himalayas for six to seven months. I was born and brought up in Vasai, but now I spend most of my time in Ladakh , climbing and training hard. I have been a mountain guide for many westerners. That is out of passion, but it’s also to train for Everest. In winter, I also go to Kashmir for skiing, for a month.” He’s definitely got the call from the mountains, then! “Definitely! I’m a Ladakhi by heart. I was trying to settle there, too, in 2018, but I couldn’t, so I thought let’s focus on Everest first.Harsh also planned to make it a completely solar-fuelled ascent, in keeping with the trend of sustainable travel. He says, “My aim was also to create awareness about solar energy. I believe in impact tourism, which is about going to a place and developing it sustainably. I thought I would carry solar panels to remote villages in the Everest region. I calculated the carbon offset — by understanding how much my sherpa and I would reduce carbon emissions by switching to solar energy.If we can be completely solar dependent in such fragile environs, then we can do so in the city, too. That said, the bottomline is, we all need to consume less, no matter where we are.”",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74799878,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-67407,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/i-was-looking-forward-to-climbing-mt-everest-i-will-not-give-up-on-my-dream-says-this-mumbai-mountain-climber/articleshow/74799736.cms

But as the coronavirus situation developed, my parents made me cancel the tickets. Now, I am staying at home and spending time with my fiancee Poonam and my dog Flirty.I was to attend a wedding with my family in Punjab. We had booked tickets for this trip for almost three months ago. We all were quite excited about it but we have called off the plan now. I think it was the best decision, given the scenario. In fact, after this, I have been proactively advising people to stay home and socially distance themselves to curb the coronavirus pandemic.I was supposed to come to Jaipur for an appearance at an NGO’s event. Dausa is also my hometown and I was looking forward to meeting my parents. But in these tough times, we should collectively stand strong as a nation and follow the precautionary measures. My show Lukka Chuppi’s shoot is stalled, like other shows, and I am spending quality time with myself.I was supposed to travel to Jaipur in April to meet my family after four months. But it was only a sensible and rational decision to cancel the plan and stay home. My parents offered to visit me in Mumbai, but I requested them to stay put at home. It is my humble request to everyone to refrain from stepping out of their homes. Hum ghar ke andar toh corona bahar. As citizens of this country, we must follow these protocols to curb the spread of the virus.On my birthday, I had planned a simple celebration with my family and sister-in-law, whom I was going to meet after three years. My wife and daughters were equally excited. We had planned a fun road trip to M’how in Indore. However, we will now celebrate my birthday at home. Self-isolation is the best way to tackle the spread of this contagious pandemic.My wife and kids were to go to Goa before me and I was to join them for three days a week later. We had planned our stay at a villa in south Goa. But in light of the coronavirus outbreak, we decided to cancel our trip.

I have been celebrating it from my earlier days in Pune. Given the current situation, we need a lot of good vibes and positive energy. So, I’m going to celebrate it at home in a low-key manner, but the traditional way.We must respect the lockdown as it is the need of the hour. But at the same time, we should celebrate every occasion that brings us cheer. This year, we will celebrate Gudi Padwa in a small way.Gudi Padwa is believed to ward off evil, invite prosperity and good luck into our homes. So, this Padwa will be all about offering prayers for the entire country to ward off the evil of coronavirus. This year's celebration is certainly going to be different as it is all indoors and without any guests.Every year, my sisters, Tejaswini and Shivangi, would get together with me to celebrate. But this year, we will perform the pooja in our respective homes. Balcony pe gudi ubharenge and we’ll have puranpoli after offering it as naivedya. This year, we all have to ensure that we don’t organise family gatherings.I’m at home in Mumbai and will not be able to meet my family in Pune. So, I'll just make video calls to my parents. It is going to be a virtual Gudi Padwa for me. I'll hoist a Gudi on my balcony, perform a small pooja and make some special food. I’ll also pray for everyone’s well-being.It’s going to be a very private celebration this year. We are not stepping out and no guests can come over. I won’t be making any sweets either, as with the gyms closed, diet is a big concern. I won’t be able to step out to buy the kadu-nimb and toran, with which we decorate the gudi. However, I will draw a rangoli outside my door. I will hoist a gudi with a new cloth and wish everyone on the phone.On Gudi Padwa, we invite auspiciousness, positivity and well-being into our lives. My parent’ wedding anniversary falls on this day as per the Hindu calendar and generally, we celebrate it with a massive feast with all extended family members. However, this year, because of the quarantine, we will limit it to a video call with them. At my marital home, I will be making some puranpoli with my daughter Rianna, who loves cooking. We will also create some multi-hued rangolis in our home temple.Gudi Padwa is synonymous with immense joy and positivity. Since I am at home, I will help my mother make puranpoli and shrikhand. This year, it is going to be all about family time for me.We are all anxious, as these two weeks are critical for India. This year, too, we will hoist the gudi, but I will dress it up in a simple manner.All of us are practising social-distancing and self-isolation, so we will make our gudi with whatever is available at home. We plan to make garlands from newspapers and paint them. During these tough times, celebrations and auspicious occasions lend a feeling of togetherness and the hope that we’ll win over all hurdles. The biggest change this year is that while earlier, I would pray for the well-being of my family, now, I am praying for the whole world.We’re celebrating the festival indoors. We may not get the flowers, but we’ll follow the other rituals. The celebrations will be intimate. Didi Maushi (Lata Mangeshkar) is at Peddar Road, Aai (Asha Bhosle) is at her residence in Lower Parel and I am at mine and yet, we feel so connected and together. My cousins and younger kids in the family, who were studying abroad, have returned home in time, so we’re all in this together. This pandemic has forced us to think about our priorities and just how important family time is. On this festive day, I hope that we become more responsible individuals.I hope that this Gudi Padwa puts an end to the spread of the coronavirus. I wish and pray for a year of positivity and peace of mind. May this new year bring a lot of good health and hopefully, everyone can make some money as people have incurred a lot of losses, too.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74795622,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-89185/74795622.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/celebs-go-low-key-with-gudi-padwa-celebrations/articleshow/74795421.cms

It has also put forth a list of educational platforms and resources in order to help parents, teachers and school administrators to provide an educational set up for children and interact with them during the long periods of school closure.Psychiatrists in the city said it is important for parents to stay informed about the current situation and to look after their children’s mental well-being. “In situations like these, children tend to get irritated and frustrated, which further leads to anxiety disorders and depression. Since, the usual lifestyle has completely changed in the lockdown scenario, the urge of going out is even more,” said Binda Singh, a clinical psychiatrist.She added: “Parents and adults in the family should limit their talks about Covid-19. Besides, they should be careful about what they say in front of their kids.”Some of the parents have been spotting behavioural changes in their kids. “My 11-year-old daughter suddenly started screaming about getting infected with coronavirus . She also said she had a sore throat. It took us several hours to calm her down. We then decided to limit her exposure to television and mobile phone,” said Arpita of Jagdeo Path.Several parents said they are using various ways to divert their kids’ minds. “Recently we found a website which has made a number of children’s books free to listen to.

Reason— scores of them have gone missing.More than 120 people from three districts in north Bihar — Muzaffarpur, Gopalganj and Saran are reportedly missing as the addresses and mobile phone numbers mentioned in their passports were found to be non-existent. Majority of them have either shifted to other places or changed their mobile numbers mentioned in their passports.“Among 150 returnees in Muzaffarpur, 68 are traceless. Similarly, 24 out of the 657 people are missing in Gopalganj followed by 30 out of 118 passengers in Saran district. Similar reports are pouring in from other districts as well,” Muzaffarpur civil surgeon-cum-chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Shailesh Prasad Singh said.The state surveillance unit (SSU), sources said, has handed a list of altogether 16,447 passengers with their names, addresses and cell phone numbers to the districts asking them to carry out a screening again in view of the coronavirus infection.Altogether 909 passengers, who have returned from coronavirus-affected countries after January 15, 2020 have been identified by the SSU and kept under home quarantine , according to a report issued by the health department on Tuesday.Patna topped the list where 100 passengers are under home quarantine followed by 74 in West Champaran, 72 in Gopalganj, 63 in Madhubani , 57 in Saharsa, 55 in Saran respectively.“It is possible that several of them skipped the screening at airports or later came in contact with people infected with coronavirus. So they need to be checked again,” says an SSU official.Saran, Siwan, Gopalganj, Muzaffarpur, Sitamarhi, East Champaran, West Champaran, Darbhanga, Madhubani, Madhepura, Saharsa, Supaul, Samastipur and Vaishali are among the districts, which are facing problems in tracing people.“We are caught in a dilemma. We have sought more details from the ministry of home affairs, which sends the list of passengers coming to India from corona-affected countries to the state. In fact, it’s an arduous task to comply with the order in the absence of relevant information,” said Gopalganj civil surgeon-cum-CMO Dr Nand Kishore Prasad Singh.Saran civil surgeon-cum-CMO Dr Madhveshwar Jha said, “As per the SSU’s latest order, we have to quarantine all those passengers at temporary quarantine centres set up in panchayat buildings or government schools in respective areas of the district. To date, they were quarantined at their respective homes.”Earlier, Gopalganj DM Arshad Aziz said government schools in panchayats have been turned into temporary quarantine centres to provide shelter to people who returned from abroad. He, however, claimed that all precautionary measures have been taken to contain the spread of coronavirus in the district, which shares its border with Uttar Pradesh.A senior IAS officer posted at the headquarters in Patna said a piquant situation was witnessed last week when residents of a village in Muzaffarpur district didn’t allow people to go to their homes without medical check after their return from abroad.

However, it gave up a large part of the gains as a similar package was not announced here during the day. The sensex closed 693 points up at 26,674. The Nifty closed 191 points higher at 7,801.The gains came despite a Rs 2,153-crore net selling by foreign funds, while domestic institutions were net buyers at Rs 1,554 crore, BSE data showed. Of the 30 sensex constituents, 19 closed higher, while 11 ended in the red.

Upon directions from the aviation regulator, DGCA, flights from 00:00 hours on March 25, 2020 to 23:59 hours on March 31, 2020 have been suspended. Following the order, a few airlines offered passengers with credit account in the same PNR with the same ticket value for later date, while others offered free rescheduling. Travel planners on the other hand are willing to pass on credit notes against tour bookings to customers.

Indigo in a statement said, “Please be assured that your Booking Reference/PNR, will stay safe as a credit account in the same PNR with the same ticket value. The credit account can be used for travel before September 30, by the same passenger.”

AirAsia India offered flexibility credit options for its passengers, which included booking to a new date for free and Spicejet said it will give credit notes with a one year validity.

Travel companies are facing acute cash flow issues. “With 90% bookings cancelled over the last few days, we do not have the resources to provide refund, thus we are offering credit share with customers. There is no expiry date for this credit, so one can use it for their next travel with us. For people who fear travel for the long run may use our other services like visa and passport, rail passes, cruise,” said Seema Ahmed, general manager of Gainwell Travel.

“At present, we have about 2%-3% of credit notes passed on to our customers, and expect it to go up going forward,” said Hari Ganapathy, co-founder of Pickyourtrail, which offers personalised travel packages.

“As a traveller, one may not want to go to the same hotel, or destination once this chaos ends. Thus, we do not recommend or offer hotel credits since it will not work on customers,” he said. Pickyourtrail has formed a recovery team to explain customers on trip cancellation and rescheduling.

Some are pushing their vacation to September and beyond. “Some customers are willing to reschedule holiday trips post October for countries like New Zealand, Australia, Bali, Singapore. However, everyone wants to cancel trips to Europe,” Ganapathy added.

One of the junior doctors said they were increasingly worried and doubtful that they could be expose not only themselves to the virus, but also their families and others.A resident doctor at AIIMS , Patna, claimed that there were enough PPE kits, but they are facing shortage of N95 mask. “We need N95 mask for doctors treating patients at emergency ward, because there are chances that the suspected cases may be carrying the Covid-19 virus. The surgical mask won’t be effective to protect doctors from the virus,” the doctor said.Sanjay Kumar, principal secretary of health department, told this newspaper that all necessary medical equipment are being made available to the hospitals. “It is an ongoing process and the medical equipment is consumable items.

PATNA: Heavy rush of passengers was witnessed at Patna airport on Tuesday as it was the last day for domestic flight operations . People from across the country landed here to return to their homes.

Altogether 23 flights were cancelled on Tuesday due to operational reasons and airport lockdown in other states. IndiGo and GoAir cancelled seven flights each mostly on routes connecting Patna with Mumbai, Delhi and Hyderabad, while five flights of Air India and four of SpiceJet were suspended.

A special flight was operated by SpiceJet between Kolkata-Patna-Kolkata (SG-911) on Tuesday for students from Bihar , who were stuck in West Bengal . “The flight arrived at Patna airport at 7pm with 100 passengers,” an executive of the airline said.

Meanwhile, four airport express special buses operated from the city airport on Tuesday for the convenience of passengers. Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said arrangements were made to send those people home who reached the city from Kerala and other places on Tuesday.

“Since operation of domestic flights will stop from 11.59pm on Tuesday, we were expecting rush at the airport,” Agarwal said.

PATNA: Deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi said on Tuesday that the government has extended the period of the one-time settlement (OTS) scheme by three months for the resolution of the pre-GST (Goods and Services Tax) tax disputes worth Rs 604.84 crore. It has also reduced the settlement amount of Rs 155.06 crore under the OTS scheme.

Modi said that the last date for the filing of applications was March 25. In accordance with the government’s move on the OTS scheme, the remaining tax disputes would be cleared over the next three months.

While the GST regime came into force in the country on July 1, 2017 after the merger of existing taxes like value added tax (VAT), entry tax, luxury tax, entertainment tax, etc in it, the tax disputes in question are related to the pre-GST or to the VAT regime.

“As per the OTS scheme, the traders concerned will have to pay 35% of the disputed tax amount, along with 10% of the interest and penalty charged on the disputed tax amount,” the deputy CM added.

He said that as many as 23,695 applications have been received till date. Of them, 6,080 applications had been cleared and Rs 20 crore deposited into the state exchequer. Prior to that, Rs 59.66 crore had already been deposited by the parties concerned, and Rs 75 crore remains to be recovered.

HYDERABAD: Though the state government claims to have made enough arrangements deal with Covid-19 cases, reality seems quite different. Despite a 24-hour helpline being set up for Covid-19-related concerns, few are able to get through to authorities, and even if they do, medical teams are not reaching their locality to conduct tests and take the infected to hospitals.

Syed Abdahu Kashaf, a resident of Malakpet, said, “I received a call from a lady who works in HiTec City. She had trouble breathing, high fever and throat pain which are symptoms of corona. I dialled helpline number 104 nearly 6 times, but there was no response.” He tagged minister KT Rama Rao on Twitter and said, “Sir @KTRTRS, we tried calling 104 for 6 times they failed to respond it’s positive case of #COVID-19 she came to Hyderabad on March 17 via flight from Jabalpur. She is ill from 5 days. She stays in a hostel and communicated with more than 50 other women. Please take necessary action.”

Similarly, P Suresh from Balanagar area said no action had been taken despite authorities being informed about a person who returned from Italy with symptoms of Covid-19.

GHMC deputy commissioner Prashanthi Vangeepuram and Cyberabad police responded after seeing the video on Twitter and collected details. Meanwhile, chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao, on Tuesday said, “ For any medical emergency, call 100. Police will take them to hospitals or make arrangements.“

Similarly, for office support, a small number of managers would come to office, while a higher number of remaining managers would work from home . Managers are rotated between these three work locations on a weekly basis to ensure social distancing, safety and business continuity. The standard operating procedures talk about what an ASM’s life would look like when he or she is in the market and what would it look like at home .“What’s happening today is unprecedented. The new set of protocols we have put in place will allow us to play a dual role of an employer as well as a provider of essential products like soaps and packaged foods to consumers,” said HUL executive director (HR) Anuradha Razdan.The company has plotted a large matrix classifying towns, areas and micro-areas that are operating in line with government advisories. “With this matrix, we ensure we continue to have contact with the trade and at the same time we minimise exposure and risk. For example, for our field force, there are clear guidelines and we make sure everyone has a shared understanding of this,” said Razdan.Considering that the situation is dynamic, leaders are required to demonstrate quick decision-making. The day starts with a virtual stand-up meeting and ‘check-ins’ to ensure all feedback goes upwards and then seeps down to the people. Leaders are told to listen in and share in. Every team has these meetings, preferably first thing in the day. “The objective is to create a virtual intimacy that will allow people to stay positive even through these very unprecedented times by keeping employees positive and bring transparency of communication,” said Razdan.At the top, the management committee of HUL meets CMD Sanjiv Mehta where the discussion is around the health & safety of people, business continuity, long-term strategy & opportunities, and how the company can keep the momentum going. Mehta is all set to hold his second virtual town hall, something that he would otherwise address once every quarter.“Communication is critical to reflect the new ways of working. So from the supply chain leadership team, it goes to the unit leadership team, or the factory heads and then to the factory leadership team, and then to the first level of manager who has a meeting on the shop floor with blue-collared employees,” Razdan said. In the next few days, the new protocols would reach over two lakh people in the extended ecosystem.The company is, however, not trying to centrally drive engagement, with team leaders developing their own personal style. “Teams are developing their own rituals and rhythm of work. For instance, we have a team that works in the big data. On the first day, they said they have set up a routine to have ‘coffee check-ins’. Another team celebrated a virtual birthday. Our R&D teams in Bengaluru decided to have a ‘Vitamin D stand-up meeting’ — sitting at home in a corner which gets sun, because otherwise in a WFH situation one wouldn’t get enough sun. We are channelling people’s ideas and learning from them,” said Razdan.Empathy is equally important. “When Sanjiv (Mehta) calls up, the first question is, ‘How are you feeling today?’ There’s also a plan to have a mindfulness session virtually to keep employees motivated.”Meanwhile, as the days progress and employees settle into their WFH routines, the tone of communication is expected to evolve to the next level. “This week was all about settling in. There’s a helpline especially created for the current stage, because they have a number of questions and they want to be heard. We want people to use this time to reflect and do things which one would not have been able to do earlier. In the coming week, once we’ve settle in this new normal, the entire focus should be back to business,” said Razdan.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74930982,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-749571,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hul-replans-ops-to-protect-staff-health-shield-biz/articleshow/74801151.cms

We have created isolation wards at different locations,” Pune ZP CEO Ayush Prasad told TOI.According to the district administration, about 50,000 people have returned to 1,000 villages in the district. “We have asked village-level revenue officials to ferret out details of these people and asked our health officials to check their health,” added Prasad.A section of revenue and health officials, however, conceded that carrying out such health checks would be a huge task for them since many people stay in far-flung hamlets. “Considering the skeletal manpower and inadequate healthcare facilities at the village level, it would be difficult to provide them timely and quality healthcare. We have asked village sarpanchs and police patils to provide details of these people,” said another ZP official.At many places, there is only one primary healthcare centre for 10 to 15 villages with very few beds. “The district administration has prepared quarantine facilities at tehsil and towns. Over 3,000 people are home quarantined and their health is being monitored daily,” the official added. The ZP administration swung into action after a 41-year-old anganwadi sevika from Velhe taluka tested positive for Covid-19. “The woman had gone to attend a wedding in Navi Mumbai and it is suspected that she contracted the disease from a virus-affected person there. The villagers are scared across Velhe as many people who were in Mumbai and Pune have returned to their native villages. Similarly, there are hundreds of people in other tehsils. How can we trace each of them in a very short time,” said another official.“Keeping people in home quarantine in a village is a tough task as most houses are small. Secondly, they use common toilets. Due to this reason there are high chances of villagers coming in contact with each other. Thus, creating adequate common quarantine facilities across the district is necessary,” a senior health official from the ZP told TOI.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74801106,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-46019,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/home-isolation-must-for-those-from-big-cities-zp/articleshow/74801107.cms

The MHS, which was launched to serve locals living around the reserve in January 2014, has come handy during the novel coronavirus outbreak.“Though Section 144 has been imposed in Nagpur and academic institutions have been closed down, health sector staffers are serving day and night in this critical situation,” said Kishor Rithe, president of Satpuda Foundation. Satpuda’s mobile health service has conducted health camps and offered medical assistance to 300 patients from six villages — Wagholi, Sillari, Khursapar, Sawara, Khapa and Ghoti.“Those suffering from fever and cough were particularly worried about the possibility of having coronavirus infection. However, it was found that people there suffered from routine fever and cough,” said Dr Manohar Khode , who is serving the tribals for more than 20 years in Melghat, after the health camps.“The MHS, which is also spreading awareness on dos and don’ts to prevent spread of coronavirus, has treated around 70,000 patients in the last six years and also offered further support for surgeries, eye operations and dental extractions. Medicine is also being distributed for free,” said Rithe.Satpuda’s conservation officer Mandar Pingle , Bandu Uike and Dilip Lanjewar informed that in the second phase similar screenings will be done from March 23 in six villages in the buffer zone of Pench on Madhya Pradesh side.Similarly, in the buffer zone of Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR), Dr Ashish Satav’s MAHAN (Meditation, Addiction, Health, AIDS and Nutrition), an NGO providing preventive and curative medical facilities to tribals, also screened many villagers for coronavirus-like symptoms in the last 20 days.Dr Satav said, “Our team is spreading awareness among tribals from 35 villages in the tiger reserve buffer.

While a Facebook India spokesperson did not reply to TOI’s queries till the time of going to press, Reliance could not be reached for comment. The FT report added that Google had also engaged with Reliance Jio earlier.For Facebook, India is the largest market in terms of users with its products seeing rapid adoption on the back of the proliferation of cheap internet plans. But the Silicon Valley-based company has also faced issues in India — from fake news across its platform to delay of payments services under its messaging unit WhatsApp.Last year, reports had stated that Japan’s SoftBank may invest in Reliance Jio. A JP Morgan research report gave Jio a potential valuation of $50 billion, while Bernstein pegged it at $60 billion.At the RIL AGM in August last year, Ambani had said that the company will become a zero net debt company in 18 months. This is being done through a slew of equity partnerships in various businesses. RIL has been in talks to sell stake in its petrochemicals business to Saudi Arabia’s Aramco, but the deal has reportedly faced delays.It has already finalised deals for its retail petrol pump business with BP and for telecom tower assets with Canada’s Brookfield, which is scheduled to be closed by the end of the financial year ending March 31, 2020.

49,['25/03/2020'],Sena MP opposes rly line through Melghat,"Nagpur: Known for his wildlife love, Shiv Sena MP from Buldhana Prataprao Jadhav has urged Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar not to sanction gauge conversion through Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR). Instead, he wants the line to pass through his constituency in larger interests of both, people and wildlife.

In a letter written to Javadekar on March 17, Jadhav has pointed out that Melghat is among the first 9 tiger reserves of the country declared in 1973. The reserve has 50 tigers and upgradation of meter gauge line to broad gauge will cause disturbance to wildlife and also reverse benefits accrued from rehabilitation of 13 villages from core area of the reserve.

As per the uni-gauge policy of the Union government, all meter gauge lines are being converted into broad gauge. Accordingly, the 176km line between Akola-Khandwa passing through the tiger reserve is also being upgraded by the Indian Railways.

Of the 176km railway line — Akola-Akot (44km), Akot-Amlakhurd (78km) and Amlakhurd-Khandwa (54km) — 38km passes through the core buffer area of the tiger reserve and requires forest diversion of 161 hectare area. The railway ministry has sanctioned Rs 1,421.25 crore for the project.

Jadhav said the project needs clearance from the Supreme Court and also the environment ministry. The proposal contains dismantling and open cutting of Talai tunnel of 360 metres which will require major cutting and blasting of rocks using heavy machineries and explosives.

“The proposal also contains realignment away from the existing meter gauge track to ease sharp curves of 23.48km out of the 38km track length from the reserve. The proposal has been recommended by Akot deputy conservator of forest considering the dangers,” said Jadhav.

The Sena MP said the gauge conversion will in the long run increase train traffic which will result into huge disturbance to the presence of 8 tigers and other rich wildlife in the project area.

Jadhav said country’s premier Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, in its recommendation on January 17, 2019, had recommended that best mitigation for the railway line through the tiger reserve is ‘avoidance’ and go for alternative alignment.

If the alternative alignment is taken, then the track passes through Jadhav’s constituency and he says it will not only benefit at least 2 lakh people but also bring about economic development of the backward region. “It will save precious forest and wildlife too,” said Jadhav.

Earlier, 30 NGOs, including Vidarbha Chamber of Commerce, Satpuda Foundation and political representatives of the region had voiced their concern against the project. Over 60,000 individuals from 68 countries have signed an online petition to save the tiger reserve.

Uber and Ola typically charge 25-30% as commission per ride from drivers, IFAT’s national general secretary Shaik Salauddin said. IFAT, in a letter dated March 22 to the PMO and the finance ministry also sought assistance for the delivery staff of Zomato and Swiggy with state-level minimum wages. Over the past week, earnings have taken a severe hit for app-based cab drivers, while online food delivery orders are declining as well, affecting the income of delivery partners.

“Even today, amid the coronavirus situation, cab platforms are sending reminders to our drivers to pay EMIs. Is this being helpful in a time like this when earnings are down drastically?” added Salauddin.

This comes at a time when Uber and Ola have temporarily shut operations in some cities in line with government orders from Monday.

Ola said it is already waiving off lease payments for drivers operating vehicles owned by its subsidiary, Ola Fleet Technologies. “Driver-partners, who are currently in distress due to the temporary lockdown to arrest the contagion of COVID-19, will stand to benefit with the reduced economic burden during these times,” an Ola spokesperson said. Uber and Swiggy spokespersons declined to comment, while TOI could not elicit a response from Zomato.

52,['25/03/2020'],Smartphone shipments to India may dip for the 1st time,"Chennai: India — the world’s second largest and the fastest growing smartphone market will witness a forgetful year with shipments into the country remaining flat or registering a fall over last year, as Covid-19 dents demand.

The Indian smartphone market surpassed the US for the first time in 2019 on an annual level, becoming the second-largest smartphone market globally, reaching 158 million shipments in 2019 with 7% YoY growth, due to the expansion of Chinese brands with their aggressive pricing and promotional strategy. It was expected to grow by up to 14% in 2020, according to analyst firm TechArc.

With the Coronavirus pandemic smashing the supply chain and bringing Chinese production to a screeching halt, the supplies to the global market are severely impacted. Just as the Chinese factories are getting ready to restart production, India has announced an unprecedented lockdown with factories remaining shut or working with truncated production schedules.

“The Indian smartphone market is expected to decline 4.2% for the full year 2020 in the worst case scenario, while the best case scenario a growth of 3.2% year-on-year. Sell out in offline channels will be impacted immediately, although ecommerce sites such as Amazon and Flipkart are still operational with work in progress deliveries,” analysts at research firm Canalys wrote in a note.

Earlier the slump was predicted based on supply side issues, but with the Indian government locking the country down, coupled with economic uncertainty, the issue has shifted from supply side to demand. “An optimistic view is growth returning sooner than later with China resuming production slowly, a pessimistic view would be a washout while a probabilistic view is a recovery in the last quarter (of calendar year),” said Navkendar Singh, research director – devices and ecosystem, India & South Asia, IDC. He said, in a post Corona situation, the buyer might look at smartphone replacement as a non essential and hence hold back fresh buys.

Demand drop will not be restricted to India. “The combination of a slower return to normal levels of demand in China (where we now expect a double-digit decline yoy), high-single digit decline in Europe, and low-single digit decline in North America is now leading us to forecast a (-) 3.1% decline in industry volumes – which in magnitude will eclipse the declines seen in recent years,” wrote analysts at JP Morgan in a research note.

53,['25/03/2020'],We may become more productive working from home,"By Prabir Jha As the country and the world battles the threat and hysteria over the Covid-19 virus, organisations and governments have responded in varying degrees. Some have encouraged their teams to work from home , others have mandated a more severe shutdown. Curtailing of travel facilities and other support systems have also made a new acronym familiar to many — WFH (work from home).This round of WFH is more to push for limiting group contact and prevent the risk of the spread of coronavirus , and not as much for work-life balance or flexi-work. But my sense is that this will take us to another phase of influencing the future of work — a subject for another day. The big debate is: Will this WFH shift lead to reduced emotional connect at the workplace?While the ruling is not out yet, organisations and leaders can use this time to create a stronger emotional connect within their teams and with the firm:*Encourage sharing of WFH stories: Most organisations turn sterile and believe there must be some firewall between home and work. Managers hardly appreciate the domestic distractions, interests and predicaments of their teams. If only they knew, some could empathise and encourage better. Today, there is an opportunity to share a glimpse of the “person” behind the role. As people share, they will express another side of their persona. I am convinced that it will only help build greater empathy , respect and support for each other.*Change the nature of meetings: Office meetings are constrained by a physical environment. WFH meetings will be quicker and shorter. However, it could allow itself to more enquiries about each other, at the beginning or the end, given the health worries. Leaders could learn to lead meetings with empathy rather than just run directive meetings. To me, this is an opportunity for nuancing leadership development. And yes, if you want meetings to be an opportunity for high-potential people to sit and observe, you can more easily invite younger talent to “sit in” and observe. This could be a great way of becoming more egalitarian and yet develop your talent.*Smart home working may leave more time for emotional connect: A lot of time at work is sitting through hours of unproductive work and meetings. Possibly, we will get more efficient and productive at work, operating from home. Companies could share virtual tips and training inputs on these. These will be techniques that can help carry forward improved productivity at even a physical workplace. The time saved could be used to call another colleague or relative, text with those you have not for a long time, help with stuff at home without the stress of travel and just connect with family better to improve relationships at home. Companies could even explore some games and group exercises for families to try out at home, and even run a fun competition along those lines. As a CHRO, I always encouraged family days, as a better engaged family is a better engaged employee. Let families be grateful to the company for helping them get closer. And more grateful families will improve employee engagement. Most of all, the hysteria and tension will be somewhat dissipated too — an important societal contribution to be made.*Create more virtual clubs for interest groups: WFH could be a very good time for organisations to think of creating virtual interest groups, cutting across locations, functions and designations. Imagine creating a community of dog lovers or photo enthusiasts. Away from the classical barriers of a physical workplace, it could be such a silo-breaking opportunity. And common interests can even dissolve frosty work relationships as they discover some things that they never ever knew about one another. Positive emotions are incubated, never directed.*Use time away from home to pause and reflect: WFH also is a great time to take anger, angst and frustration away from the recall of an inimical workplace or work relationship. It helps put life and relationships in perspective. As one has more time to pause and reflect, it can help many to wonder if many of the disturbed relationships were worth it. And to resolve to repair and let go.To attempt new beginnings. And if companies could help with some virtual counselling support through their employee-assistance programmes, many could be encouraged to liberate themselves from dysfunctional relationships. A more self-aware mind surely will bring to work a more empathetic heart. And positive relationships indeed build better business results.Every crisis has its silver lining. Am sure the current health scare and a responsible WFH regimen will enable us to see a more emotionally sensitive future of work. Let’s not see these days as a break from work. Let’s make this count more. Let’s help build more emotionally stronger relationships and, in turn, enhance the ‘Optimism Quotient’ of our workplace to bounce back stronger.(The writer is the founder & CEO of Prabir Jha People Advisory",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/we-may-become-more-productive-working-from-home/articleshow/74801173.cms
54,['25/03/2020'],"Whisky, rum distilleries to make sanitisers now","Bengaluru/Mumbai: You know the drill: Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand-rub or wash them with soap & water to control the transmission of the coronavirus. But, with an extraordinary demand for the hand sanitiser , it’s hard to find it on retail shelves or is out of stock on e-commerce platforms.

It’s here that the distilleries are stepping in. With alcohol being the star content of the sanitiser, the distillers want to make it in a bid to fill a national need during this time of crisis. They have approached the Centre with the proposal and are hoping for permissions from the states and Union territories as alcohol is regulated by them.

“It has been brought to our notice that distilleries can also produce sanitiser, for which necessary permissions may be accorded by the states and Union territories on a priority basis,” read the circular issued by the consumer affairs ministry.

Diageo is the first big player to have received permission to manufacture hand sanitisers from its 15 units across the country. The maker of Smirnoff vodka and Vat 69 whisky said its distilleries will be “repurposed” to produce around 3 lakh hand sanitisers.

Radico Khaitan, on the other hand, has geared up to make hand sanitiser from its Rampur distillery in Uttar Pradesh. “The drug officers will visit the distillery. Production should begin as soon as we get the licence,” said the company’s COO Amar Sinha .

The alcoholic beverage sector’s move comes when it has been losing sales because of the closure of bars, pubs and discotheques in several parts of the country.

With this, Indian spirit makers join their US and European counterparts, which have switched from distilling alcohol to producing hand sanitiser to help communities battle the Covid-19 crisis. The WHO has recommended that the hand-rub solution should contain at least 60% alcohol concentration to stem the spread of the virus. “The ministry has urged the chief secretaries of states to provide a waiver in excise duty for units distilling alcohol. Excise duty is prohibitive and, when included in the manufacturing cost of sanitisers, it doesn’t work out to be feasible,” said Indian Spirits & Wine Association chairman Amrit Kiran Singh. States earn 20-30% revenues from excise duty and value-added tax on alcoholic beverages. The other option, said Singh, is to allow distillers to “denature” alcohol for units that have GST registration. “Denatured alcohol, which is alcohol not meant for human consumption, is under GST and is lower than excise duty. This will make alcohol available in a cost-effective manner to the sanitiser industry,” added Singh.

A few days ago, craft beer maker Goa Brewing Company tweeted that it was making sanitisers available at a nominal cost to fight the shortage. “Our brewing team is making them using WHO guidelines for our tribe in Goa. If you carry your own bottle, you can take a free refill from our brewery.”

Reacting to the tweet, Albinder Dhindsa, CEO of online supermarket Grofers, said, “We would love to sell it on @Grofers if you can make enough.” Dhindsa had earlier said that his firm ran out of stock with its in-house sanitiser brand O’range after demand spiked for it this month.

55,['25/03/2020'],‘RBI needs unconventional measures to boost liquidity’,"Mayur Shetty | TNN

Mumbai: Bank chiefs have said that mutual funds, corporates and some private lenders are facing a liquidity crunch and the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) needs to take unconventional measures to unfreeze the markets in the coronavirus crisis. “All cash collections and consequently cash flows have gone into a freeze. Mutual funds are facing redemption pressure and unprecedented selling has hit bond markets,” said a bank chief.

Bankers said that most of RBI’s measures have been conventional — providing additional liquidity to banks through repos and open market operations. However, given the distressed situation of businesses, banks cannot provide loans. “The US Fed has taken some really exceptional measures to prevent a credit freeze. Other central banks are taking similar steps. Many were expecting the RBI to announce its package on Monday,” said the chief of a second public sector bank.

On Monday, HDFC Bank chief Aditya Puri said that there was no choice but to provide forbearance to borrowers. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision — a global bank watchdog group — on Friday discussed easing rules to avoid banks facing huge provisions for supporting companies hit by the coronavirus crisis.

Puri said that his bank had over Rs 35,000-crore surplus funds but had a simple condition for lending — borrowers should demonstrate that there will be cash flows to be able to make the repayment. The government has nudged public sector banks to provide additional credit lines, but they say providing cash support without assurance is difficult.

In the US, the Federal Reserve has re-introduced a term asset-backed securities facility that was there during the global financial crisis. It has also enabled employers to claim funds through primary market corporate credit facility and secondary market corporate credit facility. Smaller lenders are seeing demand for funds from state governments where different departments are drawing the deposits. “Once the damage is done, it is difficult to come back. Companies are not able to keep up their commitments and are sitting on potential defaults. What is needed is a 15-day or a one-month window where everything is frozen,” said a banker.

Obligations include letters of credit that come up for payment, taxes, and salaries which the government has asked all employers not to hold back. Bankers said that while the economic package can take some time, liquidity is a problem for some players and the RBI needs to provide a window for mutual funds to raise funds.

56,['25/03/2020'],No screening of cane cutters at Beed border,"Aurangabad: With a surge in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Western Maharashtra, with five fresh cases being reported from Sangli and Satara districts, many sugarcane harvesters are now leaving the region and making inroads into Marathwada.

A group of sugarcane harvesters from Satara district, which reported a confirmed coronavirus case on Monday, entered Beed district in a tractor trolley on Tuesday. TOI found them violating the lockdown at Shivaji Chowk in Beed city.

Around five men, five women and three children were travelling in a double trolley attached to a tractor. They were carrying utensils, bedding and clothes and were headed to Takalwadi village—around 10 to 12km from Beed. The group was traveling via Baramati route on Ahmednagar highway and entered Beed from Jamkhed.

Incidentally, the Beed administration has deployed teams at 14 of the district’s border check posts to screen new arrivals. However, the aforementioned group was not screened.

When asked about the cane cutters, district collector Rahul Rekhawar said that as thousands of people pass the check posts, it was not possible to screen all of them. “We are taking down details of all the new arrivals. Our teams will be reaching to their respective villages or residences in the city and screening them,” said Rekhawar.

Notably, a large number of people from the villages in Beed travel to western Maharashtra during the crushing season for harvesting sugarcane. Now that the crushing season has come to an end and many sugar factories have shut their operations following the outbreak of coronavirus in the state, many people are returning to their hometowns. Therefore, the district administration is required to take alert steps to ensure the workers are screened properly.

Meanwhile, Beed police found two men having the stamp of quarantine on their hands roaming outside in Bashirganj on Tuesday. According to sources, the duo were from Pune. The men have been sent to quarantine by the police.

58,['25/03/2020'],Bihar govt plans to assess impact of lockdown on informal sector,"PATNA: The industries department has planned to make an impact assessment of the lockdown on the informal sector of the economy as this sector is the major provider of job opportunities through self-employment in the state.

“The impact assessment will be a prelude to the most likely announcement of incentives for the people involved in the informal sector,” a highly placed source in the department said.

While CM Nitish Kumar on Monday announced incentives for the families of the poor and agricultural workers as well as pensioners, it was also felt that the impact of the lockdown on the informal sector should be assessed for the ameliorative measures to be taken in the future.

The impact assessment and announcement of ameliorative measures would also require holding discussions with the representatives of industry and trade bodies, like Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industries and Bihar Industries Association .

While Bihar is basically a non-manufacturing state as the share of its manufacturing sector in the state’s GSDP was 8.2% in 2018-19, the volume of the informal economy is second biggest after the agriculture and allied activities (forestry and fishing) whose share in the state’s economy is 21.3%.

In tune with the same, the volume of the informal economy comprising employers as self-employed persons and workers involved is large. It includes small scale labour intensive work, like trade, repair, tailoring, food preparation, loading, shoe repairing, helper in household and roadside vendors (cheap clothes, fruits, vegetables and popular food items).

The impact of the lockdown due to coronavirus on these activities has been glaringly visible. The Maurya Lok shopping complex here wears a deserted look, and so are the sites in other localities and along all major and minor roads. The sellers of handloom clothes and tailors accompanying them have become jobless, as was visible on Beerchand Patel Marg, off the Income-Tax roundabout here.

Most of the handloom cloth dealers and tailors were from distant Darbhanga, Madhubani and Jehanabad districts. One of them, Khalid, said, “Yes, today we are jobless. Around 100 others were given licences by Patna Municipal Corporation last year, but their fate hangs in balance now.”

Shekhar, who is from Mohaddinagar in Samastipur district , had been selling fruits worth Rs 5,000 per day near the branch of State Bank of India (SBI) in Sri Krishnanagar locality, but has now been sitting idle. Tuntun Sah from Buddha Colony, who was selling fruit juice near the same bank branch, has also been left lamenting the big hit that his daily earning has suffered due to the pandemic coronavirus.

NEW DELHI: Having realised that the janata curfew was just a trailer and the lockdown could now last for days, people on Tuesday seemed to be falling in line. Unlike Monday, few people ventured out on Tuesday. Even within gated colonies and housing societies, streets were rather empty. The morning walk at the neighbourhood park or taking the dog out for a walk were, however, activities that could not be postponed or sacrificed, it seemed.

Not everyone agrees with people’s reluctance to give up that walk for catching the early morning air. Bhavreen Kandhari, a resident of Defence Colony, expressed his concern. “We have a WhatsApp group for the colony and people had all sorts of excuses to go out to the park and exercise. When there is a pandemic raging, people need to stay indoors as much as possible and not go out for something that is not essential,” he said.

Many RWAs are themselves enforcing the curfew, keeping gates locked and asking people not to step out unless it’s urgent. In several parts of the city, RWAs have stopped the entry of outsiders, including domestic helps and car cleaners. Those who were stepping out said they were going only to the nearest grocery store. “My baby is just three months old and even though we have stocked up quite a few things, there are a few more that we need. We don’t know what the situation is going to be in the coming days and I cannot take a risk with my child,” said Sahil Malik, a resident of Hari Nagar.

At cooperative societies in Dwarka, RWAs said they had coordinated with the district magistrate to get passes issued for essential services workers like guards and plumbers for each society. “Some people with dogs did step out during the morning, but most people have complied. No maids are being allowed now and these passes once issued will make the entry of essential services workers much easier,” said Sudha Sinha, president, Federation of CGHS, Dwarka.

RWAs at Janakpuri have asked people to allow their domestic helps to stay at home. “They were all paid their salaries and told about the safety measures they should adopt at home. One of the residents in the colony has recently returned from Toronto and has been quarantined at his house along with his family. Even though he tested negative, we want to make sure that everyone here stays safe,” said Bhavneet, a member of the C Block RWA.

“My employer has declared work from home for all employees. It has now dawned on me that my maid too needs to be at her place just as we are at ours. We decided to pay her salary and asked her to stay at home,” said Vishal Banga, a resident of Janakpuri. An elderly resident of Rajouri Garden, Brijender, said they had advised all domestic helps to come at their own risk and asked their employers to pay their salaries and explain to them why social distancing was important.

While the domestic helps do appreciate the concern and gesture of their employers, they have other worries. “I have been working at a colony for the past 10 years and have been paid regularly too but we have to pay rent for the one-room house we live in and I am sure that our landlord will not let us stay if we don’t pay up. If I spend less on other necessities, I will be able to pay the rent this month, but I just hope that this problem does not last long because otherwise it will become a major crisis for people like me,” said Shakuntala. Another maid, Usha, said that she and her daughters have paid their dues but she fears that if the crisis gets prolonged, they will not be able to stay afloat.

Meanwhile, people are getting used to their new situation. For 28-year-old Romi Bhatia, this is the time for bonding with her husband as they are both working from home. “I have been working from home for the past three days and my husband for the past two days. We got married recently and couldn’t even go for our honeymoon since the situation started deteriorating suddenly. Even though this is a terrible reason for being confined to our homes, I’d like to look at this positively and take it as a chance to spend time together. Now that the maids have also been advised to not come to work, we will also be doing the cleaning together,” she said.

HYDERABAD: Bhadradri Kothagudem deputy superintendent of police (DSP), whose London-returned son tested positive for Covid-19 recently, has tested positive for the infection. The DSP’s cook also tested positive, while his wife and two Home Guards, who were in contact with the patient, have tested negative. The police officer have been quarantined.

On Monday, Kothagudem police registered a case against the DSP and his son, who returned from London via Dubai on March 18, for hiding his son’s travel histroy and violation of home quarantine rule, after the latter tested positive for coronavirus. After the DSP’s son tested positive, health officials carried out contact tracing and zeroed in on the people whom he came in contact and started the isolation process.

Earlier, Bhadradri Kothagudem superintendent of police Sunil Dutt had said that among those who have been isolated, the DSP’s wife and two home guards tested negative for the coronavirus. The SP had also said that four others, including his relatives and staff working for DSP, are still in isolation as their results are yet to come.

Meanwhile, Abbayya, inspector of Aswaraopet in Bhadradri Kothagudem district, was transferred on Monday and attached to the district police headquarters for hosting a dinner for several people in the town, violating the restrictions over mass gathering of people and social distancing.

They urge people with depression and anxiety to take extra care at a time when a lot of misinformation is being circulated on the social media.Associate professor and nodal officer of the de-addiction centre at the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH), Santosh Kumar, told this newspaper that people should try maintaining a routine amid the lockdown.“Staying at home for a long time can get monotonous, but adopting unhealthy practices during this time can have a long-term impact. People, especially young adults, should ensure that they stay active, do exercises and do not disturb their sleep cycle in order to remain physically and mentally fit,” Kumar says.He adds, “Instead of using their cellphones and watching TV continuously, people should do something productive like reading their favourite books, cleaning their wardrobes, cooking or sketching. Those suffering from mental illnesses should stay in touch with their specialists.”City-based clinical psychologist Dr Binda Singh shuns those, who spread fake news on social media. She says, “A lot of people tend to believe everything that is shared online. That leads to anxiety among them.”She, therefore, asks everyone to use social media only to stay connected with their friends and relatives, “instead of sharing irrelevant and fake news about Covid-19”.Meanwhile, some Patnaites claim that they are going through a tough time these days. “I am in my house for more than five days now. I have severe headache every time I check my cellphone, which is loaded with unnecessary messages related to Covid-19,” says Radhika Sinha (35), a resident of Kadamkuan Jagdeo Path resident Sumit Singh (23) says the feeling of being isolated is enough to make him anxious. “My sleeping and eating habits have changed because of which I am not able to concentrate on anything.

68,['25/03/2020'],Hospitals ‘deny’ treatment to Rohtas youth with Covid-19 symptoms,"PATNA: The family members of a 22-year-old youth, who returned from Pune on Monday, have alleged that their son has been refused treatment despite showing symptoms related to Covid-19 virus. Pune, where he works at a cement factory, was placed under lockdown by the Maharashtra government recently.The family from Darihat in Rohtas district is running from pillar-to-post for his treatment. The youth’s father, Awadhesh Singh, said his son, Sikandar, fell sick soon after he returned home from Pune on Monday. “We took him to a private hospital at Dehri-on-Sone from where he was referred to the government sub-divisional hospital after his condition deteriorated on Tuesday,” he added.The victim’s family had to persuade the staff at the sub-divisional hospital to get him admitted for treatment. “But as soon as the para-medical staff got to know about Sikandar having symptoms of coronavirus , they asked us to shift him to Narayan Medical College and Hospital at Jamuar near Sasaram in Rohtas district for better treatment,” he said.Shockingly, Sikandar was denied admission there and reportedly asked by the staff on duty to take him to home. “My repeated pleas to get him admitted fell on deaf ears at the Narayan Medical College and Hospital,” said his brother Shailendra, who had accompanied him.Seeing no hope, they brought him back home after taking advise from a local private medical practitioner.“I contacted government officials right from the sub-divisional level to the state headquarters but to no avail. Even the Rohtas district magistrate as well as the SDO of Dehri-on-Sone didn’t take notice of my repeated request,” said the hapless father.When contacted, Rohtas civil surgeon Dr Janardan Sharma said, “As soon as the matter came to my knowledge, I directed officials of Narayan Medical College and Hospital to get the patient admitted. I am not getting connected to the family to convey this message.”The PRO of Narayan Medical College and Hospital, Surendra Singh, however, denied the charge levelled by the victim’s relative. “We have created an isolation ward of 25 beds to provide treatment to patients with coronavirus symptoms,” he said, adding, six samples were sent to RMRI in Patna for test. Earlier, the test reports of two suspected patients were found to be negative.The ordeal of the family, however, didn’t end there. A police officer deputed at the Dehri town police station intercepted the vehicle carrying the patient for treatment. “He (cop) was asking for money to allow the vehicle to move on the road as there was lockdown in the entire state,” lamented Shailendra, who had returned from Pune with Sikandar on Monday.Both brothers left Pune for home on March 21 after senior officials of the factory in which they worked told them about the lockdown and closure of the factory for indefinite period. “We will contact you once the situation normalises,” Shailendra quoted the factory officials as saying.The journey from Pune to Dehri-on-Sone in Rohtas was not an easy task. “We alighted from the train at Mughalsarai (now Dindayal Upadhyay) railway station from where we caught another train to reach Dehri-on-Sone. As there was lockdown, we had to pay a hefty sum to the auto-rickshaw driver to reach home,” Shailendra added.",patna,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74803778,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-112903,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hospitals-deny-treatment-to-rohtas-youth-with-covid-19-symptoms/articleshow/74799238.cms

However, providing healthcare, food, transport and sanitation facilities in the time of corona has not been an easy task for these frontline heroes.“Most of us are doing our job without wearing masks and gloves. Officials may claim to have provided such equipment, but we are yet to get these facilities. There is so much pressure of sweeping roads and completing other sanitation work that we hardly have time to think about these things,” said Rajendra Mewati of United Front of Municipal Corporations of Delhi Employees.Chhoturam, a sanitation worker, travels almost 10km to work from his Trilokpuri residence. “I pick up garbage in the morning and then work in the sanitary department. Some residents refuse to even come downstairs to hand over their garbage bags,” he said.Saurabh Gupta, a ration dealer running a fair price shop in south Delhi, does not have the luxury of social distancing because he provides subsidised ration to poor. He has kept a sanitiser bottle outside his shop to ensure beneficiaries clean their hands before approaching the counter. “I try to maintain a distance of one meter, but when the illiterate beneficiaries require support in making a thumb impression, I have to get closer to them,” said Gupta.“I wear a mask and keep sanitiser at my shop. But getting vegetables from the nearby Okhla Mandi is a risky affair as a large number of vendors gather there,” said Arun Kumar, who runs a vegetable shop at C-Block Market, East of Kailash.Kumar’s daughter Ankita, 18, is a student of first year BA (Hons) Hindi.

72,['25/03/2020'],Pune: Court to hear pre-arrest bail pleas of Girivan project directors on March 27,"Representative image.

PUNE: A sessions court on Tuesday posted for March 27 the hearing of the pre-arrest bail pleas of Jayant Mhalgi (63) and his wife, Sujata (58), the two directors of Sujata Farms Private Limited, in the alleged Rs 96.99 lakh cheating case related to a plot scheme at Girivan hill station project in Mulshi taluka near the city.

Additional public prosecutor P S Agarwal told TOI, “The matter came up before additional sessions judge S N Sonawane, but the court had to put off the same for March 27 for want of the Paud police’s report on the pleas. Also, a written submission is expected from the lawyer of the original complainant who joined the matter today.”

Lawyer Suchit Mundada , representing the Mhalgis, told TOI, “We have made a request to the court to issue directions to the police against taking any coercive action against the applicants till the matter is heard.” However, prosecutor Agarwal said the court did not pass any directions on it.

The Paud police recently booked Mhalgi and his wife, Sujata, managing director and director of Sujata Farms Private Limited which floated the Girivan project at Dongargaon and Hotale villages 30 years ago, following an FIR by Kothrud resident Jayant Bahirat (57) alleging that they had cheated him and 14 other investors in the plot scheme.

Noted actor Vikram Gokhale, who has been named in the FIR as chairman of the company, has been granted interim bail by the court and his pre-arrest bail plea is scheduled for a hearing on March 31.

The complainant has alleged that the three company office-bearers misrepresented the scheme as “government recognised” and misused the goodwill as well as their relationship with late former MP Rambhau Mhalgi to lure investors. He further alleged that after collecting money, the firm failed to get the plots demarcated by the state land measurement officials.

In their plea, the Mhalgis have contended that they have not committed any crime as alleged and the company being a co-owner of the remaining plots in the scheme, had objected to land measurement. They stated that the firm never claimed the project as being `government recognised’ and the FIR itself describes the project as a private hill station. Moreover, sale deeds have been executed between the firm and the complainant and other investors, their names have been entered in the mutation entries and appear in the 7/12 extracts as owners.

They stated that the complainant and other investors have obtained actual possession of land, have developed it and were enjoying the properties.

The government had issued notifications in 2009 and 2016 restraining illegal process of land measurement and still the complainant and others got the land measured, they stated.

A civil suit is also pending related to the matter, they said and added the entire case is based on documentary records and no custodial interrogation was required.

PALANPUR: Thousands of labourers working in Ahmedabad have been forced to walk back to their natives in Rajasthan after their employers shut down their establishments in wake of the state-wide lock down.

Labourers carrying their belongings as well as children were seen going by foot on the highway in Sabarkantha district on Wednesday. Many of them arrived in Idar, Himmatnagar and Prantij on Wednesday afternoon, totally exhausted due to blistering heat.

“I was working in Ranip area of Ahmedabad and my employer asked me to leave. He gave me bus fare, but all public transport is closed so we were forced to walk back to our villages,” said Tejabhai, a labourer from Rajasthan.

The families found it hard to find food and water as all highway hotels are shut due to prohibitory orders. Most of them them having received a paltry Rs 500 as compensation from their employers.

However, they found help from Sabarkantha police who distributed food to them.

“I have assure these labourers that some help will be provided in the form of transport to reach their villages in far away Sirohi, Udaipur or Dungarpur in Rajasthan” said Chaitanya Mandlik, superintendent of police, Sabarkantha.

Mandlik said, “We provided them with food, biscuits and water in cotton bags. These labourers have taken an uncalculated and grim risk but they have no option.”

The labourers have been asked to walk in a group of four as prohibitory orders ban assembly of more than four people. Heavy vehicles going towards Rajasthan will be asked to give transport them home, said Mandlik.

Nagpur: Nagpur police, which is doing a good job of enforcing curfew in the city, has, however, gone into an overdrive by not allowing meat, poultry and fish shops, bakeries , etc to remain open. As a result, these items are not available in the city since the last few days.

Talking to TOI, home minister Anil Deshmukh said that he did not issue any such order. Even chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had made it clear that shops selling all types of eatables, including those selling meat and fish, will be allowed to remain open. Deputy resident collector Ravindra Khazanchi also said that no order was issued to close these shops. “Any shop selling eatables can remain open,” he said.

Police officials, however, said that they had not received any orders from the district collector to allow these shops to operate.

“We have been told to allow only grocery, medicine, fruit and vegetable shops to function. If we receive the order from the collector, we will allow meat and fish shops, bakeries, etc to remain open,” said a police officer.

Clearly it is a case of miscommunication between the two departments due to which Nagpurians are suffering.

Activist Anil Wadpalliwar slammed the officers of the two departments for the mess. “Many people are advised by doctors to have non-vegetarian food for their health. The cops are damaging the health of such people. Even otherwise when the CM has allowed non-vegetarian item shops to remain open, who are the local police officers to order them to close down? Same is the case with bakeries. Why should people be deprived of bakery items when the government has not banned them,” he said.

Tauby Bhagwaghar, who runs a chain of bakery shops, said that the cops were interpreting the order in their own way. “I read in the newspapers that all factories manufacturing food products are to be allowed to function. However, cops came to my factory in Civil Lines on Tuesday morning and harassed me for making bread. They refused to listen to my contention that bread is a food item. Similarly, our outlets are not allowed to function, which is depriving people of bread,” she told TOI.

Revti Patil, a resident of Bajaj Nagar, slammed the cops for restricting the sale of eatables. “Why do the cops want us to eat only dal chawal? Bread is a staple item for breakfast for many people but they are not getting it. Similarly, many people cook non-vegetarian items at home frequently. Why should they not eat meat and fish due to the wrong interpretation of orders by cops. The police commissioner should immediately instruct the field officers to not go overboard,” she said.

PUNE: The Baramati city police on Monday booked 16 people — trustees and office-bearers of a Madrasa — for ostracizing a 30-year-old man from the community after he raised his voice against fudged account statistics and illegal constructions on the premises of the facility.

A member of the Madrasa, the man lives at Bhigwan-Baramati Road and runs a photocopy shop in his village.

The FIR stated, the man came across a few incidents of corruption in the accounts of the Madrassa in December 2019. He brought it to the notice of trustees and other office bearers of Madrassa, but to no avail.

The man urged Madrassa office bearers to demolish an illegal wall which had been constructed a few months ago without seeking permission from Baramati municipal council and other authorities, police said.

Then the man approached government authorities with his complaint against the trustees and office bearers for constructing the wall illegally and sought to have the Madrasa’s account examined, police said.

The trustees and office bearers were not happy with the move and called a meeting in February. The the meeting was attended by the 16 trustees and office bearers of the Madrassa. They then decided to ostracize the man from the local community. The man was upset and approached the trustees but they did not listen to his plea. As the community members stopped talking to the man and inviting him to social gatherings he decided to approach police.

Senior inspector Yunus Shaikh of the Yerawada police said, “The girl’s father shifted her to a school in the neighbouring Satara district, but the suspect managed to trace her and continued stalking and harassing her.”

Shaikh said the girl’s father took a call to lodge an FIR on Tuesday after the suspect continued to call the girl.

“We have arrested the suspect on charges of stalking, criminal intimidation and sexual harassment, under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act,” he said.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

81,['25/03/2020'],No shows hit ‘Tamasha’ mandals &amp; artistes hard in Pune's rural areas,"There are about 350 Tamasha mandals in Maharashtra.

PUNE: Tamasha mandals in the rural areas of Pune are staring at huge losses in view of the Covid-19 spread, which has forced the district administration and panchayats to cancel annual fairs (Yatras) and events drawing large crowds.

Tamasha is a traditional form of Marathi theatre that involves singing and dancing. There are about 350 Tamasha mandals in the state, with each employing about 100 artistes, including women, from humble background.

The period between March and May is considered crucial money-making phase for Tamasha mandals every year. As per the tradition, the mandals set up their pandals at Narayangaon for fixing dates of their shows. However, much to the chagrin of the mandals, they are not getting any orders this time around due to the Covid-19 scare.

Avishkar Mule, the president of Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Tamasha Patishad , Maharashtra , told TOI, “The situation is not conducive in villages as many of them have cancelled our shows. We are not sure how to look after our people and get returns on money invested in buying new equipment before the beginning of the season. The state government should help us financially. Otherwise, many of our workers or artistes will be jobless in the coming days.”

Mule estimated the total loss to be around Rs 20 crore this year. “Many mandals don’t know how to pay their artists when no shows are being held. These workers and artistes completely rely on the shows for livelihood,” he said.

He said maximum districts in the state had suffered from drought last year, which hit the mandals hard. “Besides, we couldn’t get contracts due to restrictions imposed during the general elections on our shows. Because of this, it has become a question of survival for many of us now,” Mule said.

On an average, Tamasha artistes earn around Rs 2 lakh per annum each.

Senior artists Raghuvir Khedkar , who has been running a Tamasha mandal over three decades, said, “Many smalls mandals will shut down in the coming months, rendering thousands of Tamasha artistes jobless. Since they are completely dependent on shows to make their ends meet, what will they do for survival.”

Khedkar said people were asking the mandal for refund as shows were being cancelled.

AURANGABAD: Police across the eight districts of Marathwada resorted to force in order to send people, flouting the norms, back to their homes.

Scores of videos have gone viral on the social media showing policemen from Aurangabad , Jalna, Beed, Parbhani, Nanded, Latur, Osmanabad and Hingoli canning people on the road.

Initially, senior police officers did not pay any heed to these videos saying these videos would act as deterrent to those stepping out of homes for no reason, but later in the evening, instructions were passed to not record such videos as it may boomerang and fuel public sentiment against the administration and police.

Later during the day, authorities from different districts — through a series of communications — reiterated that curfew would continue to remain in place and except for essential services all the business would remain closed.

The authorities also appealed to the people to stay indoors unless in emergency situations. Aurangabad district collector Uday Choudhary said the administration is going all-out to prevent the spreading of this disease.

“People should understand that the outbreak of this disease would result into mass casualty. For us every life is precious and the orders are aimed at preventing the disaster from happening,” he said.

In Aurangabad city, 24 offences were registered by police against autorickshaw drivers and shop owners on Monday. Along with the 21 cases registered on Tuesday, the total has risen to 45.

With imposition of ban on sale and supply of country-made as well as foreign liquor, the number of cases involving local smuggling of liquor has also registered a surge.

Aurangabad commissioner of police Chiranjeev Prasad said, “Our ultimate aim is safety of the commoners. We are on the road so that unwanted people remain indoors.”

Police have also started helpline numbers so that in case of doubt or any emergency, people can get assistance without stepping out

Aurangabad rural superintendent of police Mokshada Patil informed that they have started a dedicated helpline number +91-7768932222 for the commoners to contact them for any assistance during the lockdown period.

She also said that even social media accounts of Aurangabad rural police are open for assisting the commoners. Beed district police led by Harssh Poddar on Tuesday registered 14 offences against those caught violating the curfew.

Beed police appointed a nodal officer and have appealed people to get in touch with him on +91-9921070690 for getting any emergency permission during the lockdown period.

84,['25/03/2020'],Two friends travel 700km on bike to reach home in Wardha,"The youths were stranded at their respective locations in Pune and Jalna as transport services came to a halt

Nagpur: After spending days in isolation without proper food and water, two youths from Vidarbha took a leap of faith by riding around 700 kilometres on a two-wheeler to reach home in Wardha. Since the whole state is currently under lockdown, the youths were stranded at their respective locations in Pune and Jalna as the bus and trains services were at halt.

Two friends — Anurag and Pratik--- hailed from Wardha and were working at different companies in Pune and Jalna. They went through several hiccups along the way including being stopped by cops but in the end managed to reach home.

Speaking to TOI, Anurag, who works in Pune, stated he was living as a paying guest and all of his roommates had left for their home. “I wanted to come home too, but my seniors told me to wait till Monday. However, since Sunday all transportation was closed, including buses and trains, and I was left alone. In initial days, I was ordering food online but after Janata Curfew on Sunday, I went without proper food. I had bought some fruits which were the only things I had left to eat. Finally I decided to ride home on bike,” he said.

“Initially I was worried as there were reports that district borders are closed for private vehicles too but I had no choice as I wanted to go home. So, I contacted my friend Pratik who was also stranded in a hotel in Jalna since last few days and we decided to ride all the way to Wardha,” he added.

Anurag left his PG accommodation in Pune on Monday at around 12pm for Jalna where Pratik was waiting for him.

“I had come to Jalna on Saturday for some company work, but as soon as I reached most shops closed down. I was staying in a hotel but there was no room service. I was dependent on outside food but all restaurants too closed down. I was only eating biscuits and chips for three days, so I decided to ride along with Anurag,” said Pratik.

Anurag reached Jalna on Monday at around 8pm where he rested for the night at the same hotel where Pratik was. The duo started their journey towards Wardha early Tuesday morning.

“We crossed several police check posts but were not stopped until Karanja where they asked us to go back to Jalna. We explained to them we need to go home as we don’t have any place to stay at Jalna. Finally the police let us go. We reached Wardha on Tuesday around 4pm,” said Pratik.

“It was a journey of a lifetime as we travelled from so many places and went through hiccups to reach our home,” added Pratik.

Ever since the ‘janata curfew’ was announced, people have been on a buying-spree — which has led to exhausted stocks in supermarkets and grocery shops. This rush has also led to black marketing of essential goods. Worse still, it has also led to to crowding in front of super markets and grocery shops , defeating the very purpose of lockdown in the city.

At a supermarket at Mandakini colony of Kolar, over 200 people had gathered following PM’s Tuesday’s address. The super stores have already stopped selling anything else other than food.

Prices of fruits and vegetables have shot up during the lockdown period. Tomatoes, which were selling for Rs 15 a kilo till a few days ago, disappeared from the market on Tuesday.

To allay the fears of people, patrolling cops began announcing in the evening that grocery shops and those selling essential goods will be open during lockdown.

Panchayat member R Baby, representing the ward in which the Amritapuri ashram is located, came out with a Facebook post criticizing the math’s reluctance to pass on the information to authorities in spite of repeated efforts.

He said, based on the panchayat’s report, the district collector had asked for convening a meeting and the official representing the math had said that no health worker or panchayat authorities had visited the math and demanded any information on quarantined people. However, Baby said that they managed to take 68 inmates self-quaranined at the math to conduct a test for Covid-19.

Panchayat vice-president M B Saneev Meenath also said that the health standing committee meeting held on Tuesday decided to place around 200 natives working at the Amritapuri ashram under observation in their own houses.

Matt’s version

When contacted Amritanandamayi math authorities told TOI that the Facebook post by the panchayat member was based on a misunderstanding. Harikrishnan, media relation officer of the math, said there were 58 foreign inmates who reached the ashram since February 25. “We have been strictly following the government’s direction. The report that we did not disclose the details of self-quarantined devotees was not true. Everyday, health authorities from the Alappad panchayt came to the math and they knew that the 58 of the inmates have been quarantined,” he said.

He said the math authorities were sending a daily report to the DMO and anyone could examine the email details.

88,['25/03/2020'],Home quarantine posters put up in Delhi to prevent spread,"More than 15,000 such posters had already been put up till Tuesday (Photo: ANI)

NEW DELHI: To prevent the spread of novel coronavirus, Delhi government started putting up posters of ‘home quarantine’ outside the houses of those who recently came back from abroad or were in touch with suspected Covid-19 patients.

According to officials, more than 15,000 such posters had already been put up till Tuesday to make the family and neighbours aware that they were under quarantine. Officials said strict action would be taken against those violating the orders including registration of FIR under Section 188 of IPC for disobedience to order promulgated by a public servant.

The posters were in addition to the hand-stamping process at the airport, which was started on March 18, for those who were not showing any symptoms for Covid-19 but were advised home quarantine.

According to officials, there were around 30,000 residents of Delhi who arrived at the Indira Gandhi International Airport since March 1 and had been put under quarantine. This included 18,573 passengers of category C, screened at the airport between March 18 and 22. Officials said these passengers were asymptomatic (with symptoms) when they reached Delhi and put in category C as ‘low risk’ by doctors screening them and suggested home quarantine for 14 days. Another 1,173 passengers of category B, high risk, (above 55 years of age and with medical history or co-morbidities) were under quarantine at government facilities.

After a number of complaints poured in that some home quarantined people were not following the orders, the government decided to put up such posters outside their homes, which was done by ASHA workers. Officials said the purpose of the posters was to create a sense of awareness and urgency in mind of the quarantined person, their family and the neighbours that that they have to stay indoors. “This was done in overall public interest,” New Delhi district magistrate Tanvi Garg said.

89,['25/03/2020'],Battle to save Bhilwara from clutches of corona,"Jaipur: Rishi Sharma begins his day with prayers to keep him safe. He has a town to save. Bhilwara.

The 24-year-old government nursing staffer is part of a huge team of 1,500 health workers and 2,400 police personnel undertaking the country’s largest screening exercise for the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) after 13 cases of virus infection surfaced in Bhilwara.

The magnitude of the task feels overwhelming. The textile town of 6 lakh people in Rajasthan is under curfew. Bhilwara’s borders have been sealed and the vast majority of the population is struggling for essential services. Officials said they have planned three rounds of screening and expect to complete the first round in the next two days.

So far, 5,392 persons in Bhilwara have been told to quarantine themselves at home, probably the most in any city in the country, and 38 have been put in isolation wards so far, after three doctors and nine healthcare workers from the city’s Banger Hospital were declared Covid-19 positive last week. A family member of one of these doctors, too, tested positive, taking the total number of infections to 13 till Tuesday.

Rishi Sharma’s (name changed) family watch him go with a mixture of dread and pride, and plenty of do’s and don’ts, but from a safe distance. They know their son is the only person from their locality going out every day to save a city from doom. ""Emotionally it is very draining for my family who know the danger of my job. My mother keeps messaging me and calls me to know whether everything is all right,"" says Sharma. He and others in the screening team of 1,500, split into smaller units to cover more ground, work 8 to 10 hours every day. He goes from home to home collecting information vital to identifying Covid-19 suspects in pandemic-hit Bhilwara.

The health workers include doctors, nursing staff and anganwadi workers working round the clock with assistance from the police and home guards.

CMHO Mushtaq Khan said the screening process will be challenging because the potential carriers (those who had visited Banger Hospital) are spread across the district. ""So far, 38,000 houses have been screened. The remaining 25,000 houses will be screened in the next three days. The second and third phases will be in areas which will have positive cases,"" the CMHO said.

So far, all 13 cases have been linked to the city’s Banger hospital. The local administration has identified for the second phase areas where positive cases are likely. ""A total of 120 people related to the last two cases have been quarantined and samples of 78 have been sent to the labs. If anyone is found to be virus-positive we will restart the process of screening the entire area based on their location,"" Khan said.

The sense of fear widespread, so much so that people are losing confidence and being uncooperative with the health workers.

""People are paranoid that health workers will infect them. Secondly, rumours that once the suspect is taken he/she will never come back are preventing them from cooperating. Sometimes one household takes half an hour to give us the required information, further delaying the process,"" said Subhash Goyal, a health worker in Bhilwara.

Meanwhile, in many areas families have reported shortages of milk, veggies, food grains and medicines. ""We have decided not to touch anything coming from outside, like milk and veggies, or to entertain any person from outside, even if we have to starve,"" says Akram Khan, a resident of Bhilwara’s Chippa Mohalla.

The stillness deep in the city is eerie, says Sharma, who accompanies an aanganwadi worker. ""Sometimes it’s scary moving into the interiors without hearing any human voice. The fear escalates when we knock on doors but get no response,"" says Sharma.

Strangely, such is the sense of fulfilment of a job well done that Sharma likens finding a person with virus symptoms to winning the jackpot. ""Our aim is to identify suspects and inform the doctors. The feeling doubles when the doctor, based on my input, says the patient must self-quarantine or takes him/her to the isolation ward,"" says Sharma.

At the end of a working day, any elation changes to anxiety when he heads home, back to the family he loves, even after following all sanitising protocols. ""I have maintained a distance from the family and I keep away from my parents and my nephews. They also do not interact with me too much,"" Sharma says over the phone from Bhilwara.

The health workers are received well in some places but households sometimes question their motives. ""Many Muslim households try to confirm whether we are part of an NPR or NRC team,"" said Sharma.

Around 2,400 police personnel are at the front of the battle in Bhilwara. They don’t have a manual to help them deal with a pandemic of this scale so they are following a 10-point guideline that tells them, among other things to eat a hearty breakfast and sanitise their batons and vehicles before the day begins. “It is an unprecedented situation for all of us and we are following all guidelines and turning to experience to maintain the confidence of the police force,” Bhilwara SP Harendra Kumar says. The SP's office has been regularly updating its staff via WhatsApp groups on how to keep themselves, and other, safe.

The advisory says that every policeman starts his/her day by wearing a fresh face mask and refilling a water bottle. Before leaving home they have to self-check their health status. Anyone with Covid-19 symptoms is advised to report to the doctor.

""The job is very distressing due to prolonged hours and the danger. It has been advised to share light jokes and motivational quotes to keep confidence high, said Kumar.

There was, therefore, a drastic change from Monday in the number of people on the streets. Unlike the thousands who were out of their houses a day earlier, those who stepped out on Tuesday were mostly on foot going to the nearest grocery store.While police stepped up efforts to keep people off the streets, even placing barricades on the colony lanes to prevent cars driving to the main roads, rainfall around 4pm helped keep citizens indoors. However, some hours later, after the Prime Minister announced a 21-day national lockdown from midnight, there was a flurry on the roads with people scurrying to the shops for essentials.Arpit Bhatia of Jangpura Extension stayed inside through the day but had to step out at night for food. “There was no clarity on grocery shops remaining open in the PM’s speech so I had to arrange stocks in case there are restrictions in the coming days. There were long queues everywhere,” said Bhatia.Unlike Bhatia, Parvinder Singh Nanda was out most of the day. Nanda, who is part of the NGO United Sikhs which provides welfare and assistance to the needy, said his group has been delivering food and essentials to those who require them. “There was strict checking on the roads, but we had made curfew passes,” said Nanda.Jahangirpuri resident Akhil Khanna reported seeing people on the streets throughout the day. After the PM’s announcement of a national lockdown, Khanna went with his father to purchase some groceries in the fear that shops would be told to close down. “The shops were packed with people. They were all in a panic and I had to wait in the queue for around 45 minutes despite being there for only a few basic things. Mad time, indeed,” Khanna exclaimed, before thoughtfully adding, “However, the lockdown is the need of the hour.”In order to stop people coming to and gathering at markets, the cops had deployed mobile patrol teams. They monitored the crowds around the markets and used public address systems to warn people against massing there. Drones were also used in some places to keep an eye on the throngs.In some parts of the city, the cops roped in the residents’ welfare associations to deter people from heading to the markets in groups or lingering around after buying whatever they needed for their daily needs.The cops also prevented daily-wage workers from walking into the city in groups and from gathering at spots from which they then went their ways. Section 144 of CrPC, which bans assembly of more than five persons, is in operation across the city.

91,['25/03/2020'],Cops show danda to stubborn citizens who ventured out during curfew hours,"Nagpur: City police, enforcing the statewide curfew to check the coronavirus outbreak, swung between tough and being moderate on Tuesday with violators straying onto the road with or without vehicles.

The cops, which used mild caning to even 'uthak baithak' or sit-ups holding ears with uncooperative citizens on road, will now switch to a tougher mode from Wednesday onwards with still around 10% citizens refusing to heed to government orders and police appeals.

City guardian and energy minister Nitin Raut said he had held meetings with senior officials regarding essential services and supply of commodities. “We will not allow citizens to suffer without supply of the essential commodities. In case transporters of essential goods are held up at the nakas they should contact the govermment agencies and helpline number,” said Raut.

Despite city police chief BK Upadhyay's more accommodating approach, citizens kept violating curfew leading to registration of six offences, 366 detentions and 387 penalized at the nakabandis across city.

Hassled by the relentless venturing out of citizens out of their houses with obscure reasons, trying to fit excuses within the ambit of exemptions of grocery, essential services and medical needs, Senior PI Narendra Hiware of Lakadganj police station made a bunch of violators do 'uthak-baithak' or sit-ups holding their ears at Telephone exchange chowk.

CP Upadhyay had sounded positive on his intentions to cooperate with citizens but had to change his approach after many citizens were found on the streets without any valid reasons. “Our objective is to ensure there is no crowd on the road and citizens do not throng at one place,” he had said earlier in the day.

Upadhyay, along with Zonal DCP Vinita Shahu, was present at the Variety square. At the chowk, he too confronted citizens for venturing out asking for their reasons. The top cop also urged all-women 'Damini squad' to ensure there was no romancing on the roads or public places by couples.

In a video released later in the day, Upadhyay sounded tougher. He urged the citizens to procure their daily needs of grocery, vegetables, fruits or medicines from the local shops in the vicinity which can be reached by walking.

A day ago, Upadhyay had warned citizens of seizure of their vehicles if they ventured out without the exempted reasons. He had also instructed citizens to procure passes from the nearest police stations to be able to venture out with their vehicles.

There were long queues of citizens at the police stations for the emergency passes. Around 3,500 passes were issued on the first day amid the spiralling confusions about their validity and requirement. At Sitabuldi police station, which had set up two emergency pass help-desks, there were several applicants thronging for various reasons. Cops had a harrowing time managing the crowd.

With the temperature soaring, cops too got a breather in the afternoon as citizens refrained from venturing out. In the hot afternoon, the long stretch of the Central Avenue was found deserted from Ram Jhula upto Pardi and even beyond.

As the outside temperature started dipping in the late afternoon, citizens once agains started testing cops' patience leading to harsh action at some places including the internal lanes. Strict action was seen at the slums like Kachipura and Futala basti.

In the rural, SP Rakesh Ola said there was strict sealing of four nakas leading to Madhya Pradesh and eight places of inter-district borders. ""Vehicles were screened at every place and only ones with essential commodities were allowed,"" said Ola who inspected the border sealing exercises.

92,['25/03/2020'],Virus paranoia aggravating mental health conditions,"Jaipur: Extensive coverage in the media of the spread of coronavirus pandemic globally and the number of fatalities, has led to many seeking help for mental health conditions.

Psychiatrists in Rajasthan have been receiving phone calls from patients with a history of mental conditions complaining about anxiety they have been facing in the last few days, due to the spread of coronavirus. In times when people have been staying at home in isolation, many find themselves vulnerable in terms of mental health.

Chitra Singh, psychiatrist at Sawai Man Singh Hospital, said that it is mostly the people above 55 years, who have been calling her. “We have stopped meeting patients in person due to the epidemic, but we are available on call. I have been receiving calls from the elderly as this virus affects them the most and they are facing anxiety and depression issues. Hypertension and high blood pressure are becoming common. They are feeling isolated sitting at home,” said Singh.

It is not just the isolation, but a feeling of emptiness is hitting the patients as well. Senior professor of psychiatry and principal of Medical College Sikar, K K Verma said that many people are feeling that the world is going to end soon.

“People with a history of depression, have started to feel that the world is ending and that we are all in danger, due to the discourse on social media . People are in a panic mode and not going out of the house is getting them more anxious. I have been advising my patients not to believe everything on WhatsApp. They need to divert their minds from the news and focus on positive energy,” said Verma.

Doctors have been suggesting to develop a hobby to divert their minds from the outer world. It is better to read one newspaper or watch television news for a fixed hour. Doctors are trying to encourage people to do terrace farming, cooking, chat over phone or read books.

“People should not get worried about the epidemic but just take precautions. Fix a time-table and do some exercise at home. Cleaning is a very good therapy so people should start dusting and cleaning the corners of their house that they have been waiting to find the right moment for. The phone calls are increasing and there is a possibility that the lockdown might stretch further, but that doesn’t mean more stress. Just stop reacting to all the social media and WhatsApp forwards,” said R K Solanki, head of psychiatry at SMS.

JAIPUR: Outbreak of epidemics is not new to Rajasthan and measures have been taken from time to time to prevent the spread of the diseases.

From 1937 to 1941, the state of Rajputana was hit by cholera and tuberculosis in which hundreds of people lost their lives. According to documents available at the Rajasthan State Archives, special measures were taken by the British government and rulers of those times to prevent the diseases from spreading through quarantine and vaccination.

In 1941, there was an outbreak of cholera in the state of Rajputana especially in Bundi, Jhalawar, Kotah and Udaipur regions. In Bundi state, 381 people tested positive out of which 125 had died within a few days. Residents travelling out of the state of Rajputana had to go through the screening process.

Documents from the archives mentioned that Indore state at that time built special check posts on roads and rail routes to screen people coming from the state of Rajputana.

“Travellers had to present a certificate which stated that the person has been inoculated against cholera. Huts were constructed at the check posts where people suffering from illness were detained. Only patients with the certificates were allowed to enter the state,” the document stated.

A Cholera Advisory Committee was established at the national level which suggested the usage of anti-cholera vaccines.

At the time when tuberculosis spread in the state, British government along with then rulers started crowd funding to collect money for anti-tuberculosis treatment. From the state of Jaipur, Rs 2,83,916 was collected, majority of which was utilised in establishing tuberculosis clinics in various districts of the state.

A State Tuberculosis Association of Jaipur was established whose purpose was to prevent and control the spread of the disease. They regularly visited schools, rural areas and spread awareness about the disease. Ruler of Jaipur was the patron and prime minister was the president of the association. A doctor from Delhi was called having special knowledge to deal with the tuberculosis cases.

As per the documents, on the outskirts of the city a sanatorium was built where patients were given treatment. Officials handling the disease were asked to prepare extra beds in the hospitals in case of emergency.

Later on, world came up with effective vaccines to curtail the disease. This period was remembered as good governance by the government at that time when the communication system wasn’t developed enough.

MADURAI: The Madras high court has quashed an FIR registered against a PhD holder for posting certain remarks on social media about the Manonmaniam Sundaranar University (MSU) in Tirunelveli district , after he gave an undertaking that he will be careful and measured while using social media.

The petitioner, J Mohammed Khan who had completed PhD at MSU had posted about the irregularities in the university. Based on the complaint lodged by the registrar of the university, a case was registered against him by the Pettai police station in 2018. The petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench seeking to quash the FIR registered against him.

Hearing the plea, justice G R Swaminathan observed that the relationship between the petitioner and the university was not all that smooth. The petitioner was an active user of social media and it was a remark which had triggered the university to lodge a complaint against him.

The judge observed that a perusal of the FIR reveals that the petitioner had condemned the management of the university in caustic language. The judge noted that the petitioner who appeared before the court gave a clarification.

The judge also took cognizance of the fact that the petitioner has got a bedridden dependent mother and the petitioner is eking his livelihood as parotta master. The petitioner underwent his college education on a part time basis and he was a full time research scholar.

“A person coming from such a disadvantaged section ought not be entangled in a criminal prosecution merely because he made some offending posting in social media,” observed the judge.

Since the petitioner undertakes that he will be careful and measured in his conduct while using social media, the judge quashed the FIR which was registered against him.

99,['25/03/2020'],"Grocery, veggie supply open, but citizens still go shopping","CORONAVIRUS AND VEGETABLE MARKETS: Vegetables markets in Nagpur on Tuesday March 24th, 2020

Nagpur: Curfews are not easy to survive, especially when they are as long as the 21-day lockdown announced by the prime minister on Tuesday. The state government has clarified that citizens will be able to purchase vegetables and groceries any day. Hence, TOI took a look at the pantry situation of some citizens, to find out how they are surviving the isolation and curfew. While some are stocking up on groceries, some are taking it easy and purchasing only the required commodities each day.

Rohan Baxi, Talent Acquisition Specialist with Torana Inc, resides in Shivaji Nagar and is finding it convenient as he is getting his daily commodities from a nearby grocery store.

“We are getting our daily vegetables, groceries, milk etc from the nearby grocery store. All essential commodities are available in ample quantities, and people should not panic and worry about availability in the future. The police are monitoring and enquiring when we step out, but they are making sure that people who are outside for getting daily essentials can pass without any trouble,” he said.

Kruttika Mohite, an architect staying at Tatya Tope Nagar, shared some insights about her pantry organization and stocking up on grocery. “Regarding groceries, we purchased it in bulk last week. But as we need milk from time to time and can’t go daily, so for emergency we purchased milk powder. We will ensure that visits are less often with the help of bulk purchases,” she said.

Neha Kinhekar, a student who lives near Indraprastha Nagar, is not only stocking up her kitchen with healthy items, but also has an alternate solution, if one runs out of vegetables. “Good health is the first priority for me and my family. Quarantine and janata curfew has surely taught us to adjust and manage everything with limited resources, so we can replace vegetables with pulses. Milk powder can be used instead of milk,” she said.

Agreeing with Neha, Anushree Pingley, a business analyst working at TCS, said, “The moment coronavirus was declared a pandemic, and all shops were supposed to close, I wisely stocked up on all my groceries and essentials. As of now, there is adequate supply of vegetables and milk in Dhantoli area. But their life matters too. Staying at home is for everyone. While staying back at home, I am practicing Sahaja yoga meditation, which is helping me to be calm and at peace.”

Citizens surely believe that during this difficult phase we must not lose faith in the government. Even if we run out of groceries, there will be adequate arrangements for all. “We may run out of groceries or essential commodities, but one must not forget that the current situation isn’t going to last forever,” believes Apeksha Gandharva, a student residing at Wanjari Nagar.

Showing a positive approach, she added, “There are several people who are hard hit by the current situation and are barely getting daily bread and butter. Opting for alternative daily use items or cutting down on requirements would help till the time we are back to normalcy,” she added.

Vishal Khatri, a resident of Wardhaman Nagar, is also fortunate to have a small grocery shop near his apartment. He buys fresh veggies and runs to the shop whenever some items are needed. “Our grocery shop is right downstairs. We buy milk packets, and wash the packets before cutting the packaging. We are maintaining extra hygiene when we bring some products from the grocery shop,” he said.

The decision was taken in the wake of lockdown being imposed in the state and the government has ordered the reduction of timings of all trading establishments that are allowed to function, from 7am to 5pm (except in Kasaragod where it is 11am to 5pm).

However, since the usual functioning hours of Bevco which begins at 10am will continue to be so. Though the timings have been fixed as per foreign liquor rules, the time can be reduced but not extended beyond the maximum permitted limit, without making any amendment to the rules.

The government is also considering allowing the bar hotels, that have been asked to shut down, to sell liquor through takeaway counters, on which a decision is likely to be taken on Wednesday in the cabinet. The government has ordered closing of all bar hotels, beer and wine parlours and clubs with liquor licenses till March 31. However, as per section 13 (3) (b) of the foreign liquor rules, liquor cannot be sold outside the hotel, even if it is for the residents of that hotel. This would mean that sale over the counter is illegal as per the rules in bar hotels (FL3 license). The sale is permitted only in locations within the hotel like restaurant, rooftop, adjacent to swimming pools, banquet halls etc.

Similar conditions have been laid out in the license for beer and wine parlours (FL11), clubs (FL4A) etc. tnn

106,['25/03/2020'],Lockdown Day 1: Many come out,"Bareilly: With the state government extending the lockdown across 17 districts to stem the coronavirus from spreading, residents’ response to self-imposed isolation was lukewarm in the city on the very first day, on Monday. The lockdown will be in place till March 25.

A day after janata curfew, local residents seemed to have thrown caution into the winds. Social distancing is vital to prevent the virus from spreading and that is why the lockdown was necessary. However, people came out of their houses either to buy essential commodities or simply to loiter about on the roads.

A large number of private vehicles were seen plying in Civil Lines, Qutubkhana, Bara Bazaar, Ayub Khan Crossing, Circuit House Road and others.

Police personnel deputed on roads were seen struggling to intercept the vehicles and asking the drivers to go back home, warning them of action if they ventured out unnecessarily.

Shailesh Kumar Pandey, Bareilly SSP, said, “Even as the lockdown period has been extended, many local residents were spotted on city roads on Monday. People, especially two-wheeler riders, started venturing out since 11 am as a few shops like grocery stores, ration shops, medical stores, petrol pumps, etc, were opened for a short period after the almost 24-hour janata curfew. Maximum people were spotted in the Civil Lines area in the afternoon where general stores and shops etc were opened. Besides, the vegetable market in Qutubkhana also witnessed significant footfall as people came out to purchase vegetables and fruits.”

Police officers said guidelines had been issued by state government to local administration to ensure proper implementation of the lockdown in respective districts and initiate relevant action in case of non-compliance.

UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday, announced lockdown across 16 Uttar Pradesh districts till March 25.

JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his deputy Sachin Pilot on Tuesday differed on the Election Commission’s decision to postpone Rajya Sabha polls in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic.

Elections for the three seats from Rajasthan was scheduled on March 26.

Questioning the decision, Gehlot accused the commission of giving more time to the BJP for ‘horse trading’. However, his deputy and PCC president Sachin Pilot supported the poll panel saying, “It is the right decision in the current scenario.”

“The decision to postpone the elections definitely comes under the scanner as the BJP did not succeed in horse trading in Gujarat and Rajasthan. They want some more time. Sad day for democracy,” Gehlot tweeted.

Gehlot said the decision was taken without taking political parties into confidence. He alleged that the poll panel ‘intentionally ignored’ that Parliament was in session till Monday and the oath-taking ceremony in Madhya Pradesh was held on the same day.

According to the order issued by the commission on Tuesday, elections to fill the remaining 18 of the 55 seats in the Upper House of Parliament were to be held on March 26 as 37 candidates have already been elected uncontested.

Pilot said, “I do not want to criticise the poll panel as it is a constitutional body.”

He added that even MLAs have expressed apprehension and demanded that the polls be postponed in the backdrop of the virus scare.

Congress had named K C Venugopal and Neeraj Dangi as its candidates, while the BJP fielded Rajendra Gehlot and Omkar Singh Lakhawat.

Lakhawat’s entry into the fray in the last minute necessitated election for the three seats. According to the party position, the Congress could win two seats and BJP one.

Congress’s only Rajya Sabha member from Rajasthan is former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh who was elected unopposed in the bypolls held last year.

The Congress, which came to power in the state in December 2018, enjoys the support of 123 MLAs, including independents, while the BJP has the support of 75, including its ally RLP. CPM has two MLAs in the 200-strong assembly.

Alleging inadequate safety arrangements and high human density in the jail, they said that they were at high risk of infection.

In a letter addressed to the Chief Justice of India, they have cited Section 144 stating that more than four persons could not assemble at one place, while the jail has so many inmates crammed in a barrack, which was violation of social distancing protocol.

The letter said that there were no adequate medical facilities, if infection spreads in jail through the jail guards, who keep coming and going in and out of the jail.

“They bound to meet the jail inmates and there was no proper screening facility in jail for these guards. Not only this, but inmates from outside are brought into the jail premises and there was always a threat of them getting infected,” letter said.

They also termed the delay in judicial proceedings due to effect on work in courts. They have stated that due to this delay, their prospects were being affected.

With these allegations and apprehensions, they have demanded release from jail through bail, interim bail and parole by way of a designated format and warned of protest in jail from Tuesday.

Reacting to this protest, jail superintendent Kailash Trivedi said there were adequate medical facilities in jail and doctors of jail have been keeping close watch on the health conditions of the inmates.

“Even in routine, inmates’ health is properly taken care of. But these days in view of corona outbreak, we have been keeping adequate caution with regard to the health of the inmates,” he said adding that it included proper screening of every outsider.

He said that the capacity of Jodhpur Central Jail was 1475 while the present head count in the jail is 1,350, which was 175 below the strength. Recently, 15 inmates from Pali and 30 inmates from Bhinmal jail have been shifted here due to over-strength in these jails.

According to Trivedi, the demand of inmates was nothing but to get freedom from jail under the veil of corona outbreak.

He said that entire jail premises has been sanitized and fumigated and every aspect of the outbreak was being properly taken care of so that the virus did not affect jail.

NEW DELHI: With the capital in complete lockdown to check the spread of the novel coronavirus, the faithful will not, as usual, gather at temples when the Navratri festival begins on Wednesday. The major city temples instead are prepping to offer Delhiites the novelty of participating in the aarti and having a darshan from the safety of their homes. This is one win for technology over the virus’ ground assault.

Dedicated to Goddess Aadi Shakti, the Jhandewalan temple near Karol Bagh is among the oldest in Delhi and attracts lakhs of people during the nine-day Navratri period. It has made extensive arrangements to deter people from congregating there. “We have informed everyone besides putting up huge banners on all four sides of the temple warning of a closure till the next update,” said Sandeep Kumar, the temple spokesperson. “Devotees should worship Devi Maa in their own homes.”

But that will not deprive worshippers of participation in the pujas. Kumar elaborated, “The aarti of Devi Aadi Shakti will be live streamed on YouTube as Jhandewalan Devi Mandir Live Aarti. While the 4am morning aarti and the7pm evening aarti will be available live on all nine days, we have made arrangements to have a 24-hour live session on the auspicious day of Ashtami.”

Authorities at south Delhi’s Kalkaji Mandir have decided to appeal to devotees to carry out the Navratri rituals in their houses. Lokesh Bharadwaj, general secretary of the Shri Kalkaji Mandir Prabandhak Sudhar Samiti, said the pooja-archana-sringar will be carried out by the temple priests, but the lakhs who came to the shrine to take jyoti will be urged not to venture to the shrine this year.

Bharadwaj said that a meeting between committee members and the temple high priest will decide whether the proceedings will be streamed live. Perhaps for the first time in the history, there will neither be langars or bhandaras nor people thronging the temples. Jai Prakash, chairman of North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s Standing Committee, said anyone wishing to organise a bhandara should instead have a “bhandaras of soaps and hand sanitisers” for poor people as a service to Devi Maa.

The Chhatarpur Temple has been closed from March 21, and the shrine management has made arrangements for the live streaming of morning and evening aarti on the temple website.

City commissioner BK Upadhyay had said on Monday that people who need to travel in city for some emergency should approach the nearby police station and collect passes after giving valid reason. On Tuesday, citizens lined up at police stations to get passes so they can travel in city for their work. Several government employees, doctors, pharmacists, relatives of people admitted in hospital approached police stations to get the passes.

After checking credentials and reasons given by the citizen the passes were issued from several police stations.

Sitabuldi police officials went a step further and installed a booth for issuing passes at Variety Square. Several citizens lined up at the booth to get passes.

Manoj Chandak, a pharmaceutical store owner, who has an office at Dhantoli, said, “I need to go to Gandhibagh regularly to buy pharmaceutical items. I wanted the pass so I can legally go to buy items without any hiccups.”

Another citizen Pranita Deshpande had come to the police station along with her husband to get a pass as the couple runs a grocery store at Sitabuldi. “I wanted the pass so that I can work properly. I also had some work at the bank, so if I have the pass I can go there without any problem,” she said.

Dr Abhay Pathak, who had gone to Sitabuldi police station, claimed that he was dismayed by the behaviour and language of the police towards common people. “I received the pass, but the cops were yelling at citizens, which is not right,” he said.

A senior police official told TOI that several people had come to the police station claiming they need the pass. “Most of them used medical emergency as the reason to get a pass, so we had to issue it,” he said.

He posted a video which is circulating on social networking sites.

He has sent message to all those hiding their travel history to evade home quarantine or admission in isolation wards. “All Dhola villagers are requested not to worry. I am fine. I opted for Covid-19 testing in the interest of the village and for my country,” he said.

He had returned from Dubai on March 18 and tested positive for the disease when he reached Pali. He was the first case from Jodhpur division. He has been admitted to the isolation ward in Bangar Hospital in Pali and his entire family has been quarantined at home. Now, he has been shifted from Pali to MDM Hospital in Jodhpur.

“I had fever, so I decided to go to hospital for Covid-19. Don’t worry about me. People are worried because of coronavirus. But, I am fine and I don’t have fever now. I am fine. Don’t spread rumour in the village. My family also lives in the village and rumours will give wrong message to my family. I will reach village soon. I will take part in Charbhuja jagaran soon,” he said.

However, health department officials claimed that a man from Dhola village in Pali district had returned from Dubai on March 18 but in spite of symptomatic indicators, he did not visit the hospital.

“On the information about a foreign visit by him, our team went to his home and took him to the hospital for isolation. His sample was sent for examination which tested positive for COVID-19,” said the official.

The official said, there have been multiple cases, where such persons have escaped reporting to the medical department for screening despite having symptomatic indicators.

Nimu had even called her brother Chetan Thoriya, who lives in Vankvad village, and asked him to convince Chatur. Chetan had told her not to worry and said that things would settle soon. However, she took the drastic step at around 11pm on Monday. Following Chetan's complaint, Kuvadva Road police booked Chatur under IPC section 306 (abetment to suicide).

120,['25/03/2020'],"BMHRC to treat only Covid-19 patients, gas survivors &amp; activists slam govt move","Bhopal: State government has identified Bhopal Memorial Hospital and Research Centre as a state-level Covid-19 treatment institute. Hereafter, only Covid-19 patients will be treated in this hospital.

Principal secretary, public health and family welfare Pallavi Jain Govil issued this order on Tuesday.

This move has drawn protests from survivors of the Bhopal gas disaster and activist groups working among them. The order said that BMHRC, a super specialty hospital, has been identified as an institution for treatment of Covid-19.

Only coronavirus positive patients will be treated in the hospital and the order will come into effect immediately.

As the BMHRC administration started evacuating the hospital, constructed for treatment of the gas disaster survivors at the behest of the Supreme Court, activist groups working among the gas victims swung into action, lambasting the decision and demanding its immediate withdrawal.

“The order spells doom for gas victims who were getting treatment here. Where will they go? How can a hospital with an OPD of 4,000 (inclusive of its six mini units) be converted into an isolation centre? Moreover, it’s a closed campus with families also living there. It can’t be converted into an isolation centre,” tweeted Rachna Dhingra, co-convener, Bhopal Group for Information & Action.

She claimed that she tried the whole day to talk to Goel, but the latter she didn't pick up her phone.

Goel didn't respond to phone calls by journalists either. Convener of, Bhopal Gas Peedit Sangharsh Sahyog Samiti (BGPSSS), N D Jaiprakash, was also surprised by the order. Stating that it is a clear violation of the Supreme Court order, he said that his outfit would move the apex court to get the order revoked.

Dhingra also said that her organisation would move the apex court as early as possible because the court —in its order—had observed that right to treatment for gas victims was equivalent to the right to life. Senior doctors of the BMHRC were also upset with the order.

“Six gas victims are on ventilator. More than 4,000 gas victims turn up at the BMHRC OPD or its mini units and 230 gas victim get dialysis here. Where will they go?” asked a senior faculty at the hospital, on the condition of anonymity.

Purnendu Shukla, member of the Supreme Court Monitoring Committee, set up to supervise medical facilities being given to gas victims by gas relief hospitals, including BMHRC, said: “It’s blatantly wrong. It is against the mandate with which the BMHRC has been set up. I also tried to talk to the principal secretary, health, but she didn't respond.”

124,['25/03/2020'],Shaheen Bagh News: How Delhi cops end 100-day Shaheen Bagh protest,"Police said a dozen people were detained from Shaheen Bagh for violating prohibitory orders

NEW DELHI: The colourful tent that once was a symbol of “resistance” against the Citizenship Amendment Act was dismantled on Tuesday, 100 days after it was set up. As police personnel cleared the Shaheen Bagh protest site due to Covid-19 outbreak, the women said it was a “pause” not a defeat.

“Shaheen Bagh has become a thought process. It isn’t a neighbourhood anymore. The protest will continue. We will first fight novel coronavirus and then come back to defeat hateful and divisive politics,” said Hena Ahmad.

On December 15, shaken by images of violence against Jamia Millia Islamia students, a group of women had taken over the streets, determined to raise their voices for the country’s children and to register their protest against Citizenship (Amendment) Act, NRC and NPR. They sat through the harshest Delhi winters, didn’t budge when it rained and remained undaunted despite the risk to their safety when a man opened fire. Over the days, the canopy under which hundreds of women sat, changed colours, speeches from the makeshift stage became more measured and public address systems became more sophisticated. But the aim of the protest remained same — “to fight for the Constitution”.

Ahmad said that police officers removed everything within an hour. “They gave a clarion call in the beginning that they were following orders to impose curfew conditions. But there were just five people sitting under the tent then. We were following the rules,” she said.

Although the eviction led to disappointment, it was soon replaced by new-found stamina by the first-time protesters, who resolved to continue the protest on social media till the health crisis got over. “We will win the fight against novel coronavirus and against CAA, NPR, NRC too,” said Ritu Kaushik, at the forefront of the resistance.

In the weeks since the gravity of Covid-19’s spread was realised, protesters at Shaheeen Bagh had discussed whether to call it off or continue on low-key — following all directives. “Shaheen Bagh’s stature was such that if the protest was held in abeyance, perhaps, just perhaps, police would not have dared touch the tent,” said Shaheen Kauser, a mature voice whose firm reasoning had brought many disparate views together over the last three months.

Many said that no matter whatever precautions are taken, “all the blame will be heaped on Shaheen Bagh”. In the last few days, just five women at a time were present at the tent, wearing masks and carrying sanitisers.

“What the Shaheen Bagh protest has become in 100 days was beyond imagination when we started. Similarly, the threat of Covid-19 is beyond imagination. Our constitutional fight will continue, but we always held that in such a healthcare crisis, we stand with all and heed all directives. We have been doing that. I am very sad today. There was no need to remove the tent. The women were following all precautions,” said Kauser.

“Police took advantage of the protesters paying heed to the fight against coronavirus and forced eviction,” said one of the protesters, while discussing on social media plans to ramp up the fight online till the lockdown is over.

Kaushik said, “Delhi Police came to the spot at a time when the case of the road was still in Supreme Court. They removed not just the tent, but the library, posters, everything. It was evident that the government was not only fighting Covid-19 but also the Shaheen Bagh protest.”

It is also sensitising staff at MPs, judges and bureaucrats’ bungalows and servant quarters about coronavirus. An NDMC official informed that all precautionary measures are taken from their side and staff is regularly submitting action taken report to senior officials. “Though footfall has decreased in state guesthouses, to be on the safe side, two teams are checking these areas and contacting RWAs,” said the official.

On Delhi government’s direction, civic agencies have set up a facility to quarantine suspected Covid-19 cases at Bakkarwala, Kalkaji, Malka Ganj and east Delhi areas.

The NDMC on Monday sanitised its newly constructed complex at Bakkarwala for quarantine. “The complex has around 240 flats and was constructed for economically weaker families living jhuggi clusters,” said an official from NDMC health department. The department had earlier dedicated six isolated beds for keeping infected patients at Charak Palika Hospital in addition to reserving four ambulances for carrying such patients.

The South Delhi Municipal Corporation has developed a similar facility at Purnima Sethi Hospital and North Delhi Municipal Corporation at Hindu Rao.

In east Delhi, Municipal Corporation has converted the private ward at Swami Dayanand Hospital for infected cases.

“This is a valuable service consistently provided by compassionate individuals. The absence of it may cause many animals and birds to suffer and die, and the carcasses may further spread different diseases,” AWBI director Dr O P Chaudhary, said in the communication.

The AWBI also sought a directive to authorities concerned to create awareness among the public to take care of stray animals during the Covid-19-triggered lockdown.

“The law enforcement authorities may also be directed to see that animals and birds do not suffer,” the communication said.

It also demanded the inclusion of veterinary services in the list of ‘essential services’.

128,['25/03/2020'],Health workers stigmatised for working in isolation wards,"Medical shops use ropes to distance customers in Bhopal on Tuesday

New Delhi: In his address to the nation on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi once again lauded the work of health workers out in the trenches battling coronavirus. Yet in certain parts of the country, these soldiers of humanity are facing social stigma. Fresh reports from Kerala, Bengal and Karnataka highlight cases of discrimination against them.

Union health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan too acknowledged the problem posting a tweet on Tuesday evening. “I’m DEEPLY ANGUISHED to see reports pouring in from Delhi, Noida, Warangal, Chennai etc that DOCTORS & PARAMEDICS are being ostracised in residential complexes & societies. Landlords are threatening to evict them fearing #COVID2019 infection. Pls don’t panic!”

In Kerala, three young male nurses, who had voluntarily opted for duty at the isolation wards for Covid-19 patients in the Government Medical College Hospital, Kottayam, had to leave their rented accommodation after the landlord voiced his concern. More shock lay in store. None in the locality were ready to rent out their homes as they were associated with the Covid-19 patients.

“We had voluntarily come forward for this duty. We have been extending all support to the state government in its fight against this disease. But there is nobody with us. We are in a helpless situation,” a nurse said. Following the intervention of collector P K Sudheer Babu, the hospital superintendent agreed to allot an unused quarter on the campus on March 13 for two weeks. The quarter was handed over to them four days ago. “We don’t know when might be asked to move out from this temporary home,” wondered one of the nurses. In Kolkata, it was a similar story for some nurses attached with hospitals where Covid-19 patients are either getting treated or have died. They too were asked to vacate their rooms by their landlords.

A male nurse who shared a flat in Salt Lake with two other colleagues faced problems when the neighbours came to know of the death of a 57-year-old Covid-19 patient. Another nurse from the Infectious Diseases and Beliaghata General Hospital, the apex hospital for Covid-19 in the state, was asked to leave her rented apartment. A government doctor from the Murshidabad Medical College and Hospital (MMCH) was thrown out of his rented accommodation in Behrampore by the landlord on Monday.

In Karnataka, three private medical colleges in Devanahalli, who had joined hands with the state government to provide quarantine facilities to suspected Covid-19 patients, are facing an acute shortage of housekeeping staff. Reason: Fellow villagers come do not want the health care staff to work in the quarantines. Those who do are barred from coming back home. “We have about 100 housekeeping staff to maintain a 400 bed hospital. Since the time we started admitting senior citizens returning from Covid-19 affected countries in quarantine, the housekeeping staff have stopped coming. They come from the neighbouring villages. We are working with just four members to clean the hospital,” said the spokesperson of a private college near the city.

It’s a different story in Jharkhand and Bihar. Health workers in Jharkhand haven’t faced any kind of ostracisation. Instead they are being appreciated for their hard work. Doctors and nurses working at major government as well as leading private hospitals said that they are being applauded for their work from common people.

“I stay in a rented accommodation in Bariatu with my family and visit RIMS daily but neither my landlord nor the neighbors have raised any objections due to my profession. On the other hand, they always inquire me on the situation on COVID-19 and ask me about the preventive measures,” said a senior surgeon with RIMS.

IMA Bihar member Dr Harihar Dixit said he had not heard of any instance of doctors or nurses being ostracized in the state. Dr Neeraj Agarwal, posted at community medicine branch in AIIMS-Patna, gave a similar reply.

Mangaluru: Inspired by an apartment in Vietnam , Orchard Apartment at Arya Samaj Road in Mangaluru has introduced the “toothpick system” for lift buttons to curb the spread of Covid-19 .

“Drawing inspiration from several videos that we received on various social media platforms, and a report that stated that an apartment in Vietnam has introduced the toothpick system in lifts, we have placed a thermocol board inside the lift, on which toothpicks have been placed for single use, to press the lift buttons. A plastic bottle to dispose of the toothpicks, and sealing the lift button with cling foil has been undertaken,” stated the Orchard Apartment Owners Association.

In addition, the apartment has issued several guidelines to curb the spread of Covid-19. A washbasin has been placed at the entrance, making it mandatory for all to wash their hands before entering the apartment. The entrance has been restricted to one door only so that everyone adheres to the guidelines. The association stated, “Delivery partners have to report to the security counter only.”

Some of the guidelines include restricting only four passengers at a time in the lift and encouraging people to use the staircase without touching the railings, if possible. Residents will have to collect their parcels themselves from the security counter, and have been requested to avoid inviting guests’ home. Residents have been asked to strictly avoid conduct any civil work or work on the interiors of their apartments, or any sort of renovation involving labourers, until further notice. No labourer will be allowed inside the building to carry out any kind of work, except the electrician and plumber who do routine maintenance works of the building. No shifting of any kind of household items are permitted where labourers are involved. However, if there is an unavoidable circumstance, for shifting of an item, the building manager has to be contacted, who in turn will make suitable arrangements.

Residents have been asked to relieve their domestic help and housekeeping staff, and to segregate and dispose of waste at the designated area. The 16-floor building has 92 apartments.

Elevators are considered as a high-risk place for the spread of viral diseases as they are in a confined space where buttons are pressed with bare fingers numerous times a day.

130,['25/03/2020'],"Confusion prevails on first day of lockdown, police register 402 cases","Thiruvananthapuram: Confusion over the term ‘essential goods’ prevailed widely on the first day of state-wide lockdown, with many trying to find loopholes and police trying to enforce the lockdown order. On day one, police registered 402 cases across the state for violations, with Thiruvananthapuram city leading the chart with 121 cases. As many as 47 cases were registered in Ernakulam city.

In the capital and many other parts of the state, people came out citing purchase of essential goods , while several shops opened for customers including roadside tea shops, citing that they are selling essential goods like fruits and milk.

Though state police chief Loknath Behera came out with clarifications about the instructions laid out in the order, the ambiguity over which shop would be categorized as those selling essential goods and which are not, prevailed in many places.

However, he clearly said that the use of autos and taxis will be limited only for procurement of essential goods. ""There are several instructions laid out in the order including social distancing, opening of certain shops alone. There are several exceptions also. But use of taxis and auto for procuring essential goods or medical requirements alone can be permitted as said in the order,"" he said.

Behera said that police will issue passes for those who are working in the essential category, which will permit them to go to their respective work places. ""For exempted category, we are issuing a pass which is not required for media persons and government servants. Objective is to reduce the possibility of transmission (of Covid-19),"" he said. The passes will be issued by all the district police chiefs in their respective districts.The police have also introduced a condition that those using their own vehicles for going out will have to give a declaration. ""We are issuing another order, using private vehicle, coming out of the house has to give a declaration that I am going out on such a specific purpose. We will verify it, and if it is found false, there will be action against them,"" he said.

Later in the day, the state police chief asked all the police officials across the state to come out in the public to strictly enforce the lockdown that has been declared by the state government. He also said that no public should come out in the public without any specific purpose, violating which strict action will be taken against them.

131,['25/03/2020'],Daily wagers on brink of unemployment,"Visakhapatnam: The coronavirus outbreak has added insult to injury for daily wage labourers, especially construction workers, in the Port City, who have been recovering from the aftershocks of sand crisis.

Around three lakh daily wage labourers are on the brink of unemployment following most businesses being shut down and construction work being suspended as precautionary measure against Covid-19.

There are allegations that GVMC staff have been closing down shops, including eateries, as against the higher officials’ instruction to only shut shopping malls and multiplexes. Moreover rumours have only compounded the problem.

A large section of the three lakh daily wagers are from neighbouring districts of Srikakulam and Vizianagaram. Many of them stay at Allipuram, Jnanapuram, Thatichetlapalem, Kailasapuram, Isukathota, Venkojipalem, Arilova, Chinnagadili, Thotagaruvu, Madhurawada, Akkayyapalem and One Town areas.

But since the coronavirus positive case was reported in the city, people are hesitating commissioning work.

“My employer told me that till March 31, there will be no work as the virus threat is looming large. We came from Palasa in Srikakulam district to Vizag for livelihood eight years ago. We can survive if we do not have work for one or two days, beyond that we will not manage,” said a construction worker K Ramunaidu of Isukathota area said.

Men usually earn Rs 400 to Rs 450, while women get Rs 300 to Rs 350 per day. “Although there is no instruction to suspend construction work, we have decided not to take risks. So we will slow down our work till March 31,” a builder, on condition of anonymity, said.

Speaking to TOI, district joint collector Venugopala Reddy told TOI that there are no instruction to close small shops and eateries. “We are urging people to minimise their routine travel and practice social distancing as part of precautionary measures against COVID 19,” he said.

132,['25/03/2020'],Chennai: Patients receiving live-saving treatments in a fix,"Representative image

CHENNAI: Thousands of patients in Chennai, who visit hospitals periodically for life-saving treatments, are in a fix as all public transport options will be shut from Tuesday evening.

This included treatments like dialysis for kidney patients, chemotherapy and radiotherapy for cancer patients.

These are patients, who need not be hospitalised for a longer period, but face the risk of losing their lives if they miss out a single session. Even if some patients can afford to get admitted for long, not all hospitals have enough beds to accommodate them.

There are around 50,000 dialysis patients in Chennai and many depend on autos, buses and taxis.

“Not sure if hospitals are equipped to pick up and drop patients at their doorsteps. Also, 108 service can be availed only during emergencies. So they should be exempted and allowed to engage private taxis or autos,” said Rajan Ravichandran, director of MIOT Hospital, Manapakkam. The government can set up a helpline for these patients so that transport can be arranged on request, he said.

Some patients travel from suburban areas to hospitals in city because of the demand, quality and their personal conditions. For instance, those with hepatitis B, C or other viral infections can only visit hospitals which have specialised kits.

These patients can neither opt for nearby hospitals as an alternate option temporarily, nor can they be treated at home. as the procedure is still not popular in Indian cities.

R Saraswathy, an elderly woman from Valasaravakkam who visits a private hospital in Vadapalani at least twice a week, said she is more scared to step out after watching videos of police forcefully dispersing those coming out.

“We request the government to sensitize police not to stop vehicles transporting patients,” said Latha Kumaraswami, managing trustee of Tanker Foundation, which runs three centres in Chennai in association with Greater Chennai Corporation .

Not only these centres, but many other hospitals have provided authorisation letters to their patients explaining their condition and need to reach hospitals without delay. This might help them in convincing the police at checking points and district borders.

A dialysis session takes four hours and costs somewhere between Rs.1,500-2,500. Since demand is high, patients can’t afford to miss their slots. So any delay en route to hospital will put their lives at risk.

“Until now, patients have reached on time. Wednesday will be a litmus test. We have deployed vans for staffs without own vehicles and increased their travel assistances. Because their safety is also equally important,” Latha added.

In a video that went viral on the social media on Tuesday, the IndiGo crew said she and her mother were being harassed by the RWA and even groceries were not being provided to them, in the fear of her spreading the novel coronavirus.

“My job requires that I be there for duty, and my company is taking complete precautions for me to be safe from Covid-19,” the crew member said in the video. “When I’m not at home, they (RWA members) come and harass my mother. She cannot go to the market to buy groceries, because people are telling her that ‘your daughter has corona and you might also have it’,” she said.

136,['25/03/2020'],Shaheen Bagh: Lawyers say viral fight priority,"Shaheen Bagh protest site was cleared by Delhi Police on March 24

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court-appointed mediators, who had urged the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protesters at Shaheen Bagh to move to an alternate site, said the country was facing a “grave pandemic”, which was a matter of everyone’s priority.

Reacting to the clearance of the protest site on Tuesday morning, lawyers Sanjay Hegde and Sadhana Ramachandran pointed out that while some rigours of the blockade were relaxed by the protesters by clearing peripheral roads, the remaining few Shaheen Bagh protesters were finally dispersed “peacefully with minimal force”.

Owing to the communal riots in northeast Delhi, the apex court had adjourned a plea to shift the Shaheen Bagh protest to an alternative site to March 23. Following their first round of dialogue, the mediators had submitted their report in the court in February. During the second round of dialogue on March 3, they praised the protesters for maintaining peace and calm despite tensions surrounding other parts of the city.

The lawyers, on Tuesday, requested people not to perceive the clearance as a question of “winning or losing” while urging both the administration and the protesters to not do anything that could aggravate the situation. “The country has a grave pandemic threatening it and currently that must receive priority in terms of everyone’s attention,” the interlocutors said. They also requested the administration and the protesters to not do anything that would “exacerbate the underlying tensions that culminated in the street protests”.

According to the mediators, the process of interlocution had reinforced a number of valuable lessons, including the need for continued dialogue at all times. “We believe that the Supreme Court mandated interlocution kept the protests at Shaheen Bagh peaceful even while violence erupted in other parts of Delhi,” they added.

The interlocutors have, until now, submitted two reports to the SC detailing their efforts and the situation prevailing in the area. They have also held several dialogue sessions with the protesters following the direction from the apex court.

In all their meetings, the lawyers urged the protesters to find an amicable solution and lauded them for carrying out peaceful protests. They had, however, raised concerns over public inconvenience. During one such dialogue, they told the crowd that “Shaheen Bagh barkarar rahega” (Shaheen Bagh will survive) but it was necessary to ensure that others were not inconvenienced. “Nobody should be troubled. We live in this country to help one another and not trouble each other” they had said.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police vacated all the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act sites , including the one at Shaheen Bagh in south-east Delhi, where protests have been going on for over 100 days. On Tuesday, as police enforced the lockdown announced to check the spread of Covid-19, they also cleared these places. At Shaheen Bagh, some people were detained for violating prohibitory orders despite being warned against it.

The cops moved in with cranes to remove the temporary structures erected by the protesters in these places. The massive tents under which the sit-ins were held were dismantled in Shaheen Bagh, Seelampur, Hauz Rani and other areas. Police had earlier requested the protesters at these sites to disperse to avoid infection by the novel coronavirus.

At Shaheen Bagh, police officers arrived with paramilitary personnel at 6:45am, having asked the protesters late on Monday to vacate the site on the road to Kalindi Kunj. The officers once again directed the protesters to move out of the area. However, some protesters were reluctant to give up, and a few tried to push away the cops. This forced police to detain nine people, including six women, for violating Section 144 CrPC banning assembly of more than five persons.

Eight trucks and two trailers, hydraulics and cranes each were pressed into service to clear the site, helped by around 300 labourers. The hydraulic cranes dismantled the tents and removed the other structures from the protest site. The materials and structures removed will now become case properties.

RP Meena, DCP (South-East), disclosed, “We have been requesting the protesters for some time now to leave the site to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and due to the lockdown. At this time the movement of essential goods and services is crucial and this road is an important stretch connecting Noida with various parts of Delhi.”

As the cops were getting the Shaheen Bagh site vacated, action was also taken to clear the other sites at Jamia Millia Islamia, Turkman Gate, Hauz Rani, Sadar Eidgah, Bara Hindu Rao, Inderlok, Seelampur and Nizamuddin. At most of these places, there was little resistance from the locals. In fact, the eviction drive on Tuesday was supported by the locals of all the affected areas.

While clearing the Seelampur protest site, 17 people, including five women, were taken in, while a lone woman was detained at Inderlok and released later.

Soon after, police approached the civic bodies to re-construct the damaged portions of the roads where the protest sites were located. At Shaheen Bagh, DCP Meena said, “We have requested the municipal corporation and PWD to assess the damage and fix the road.”

At Jamia, the cops removed the nails dug in the road and dismantled the tents and banners put up on the road. Some labourers were later seen whitewashing the walls that had graffiti painted by the protesters.

Many of them offered roses to police personnel and even garlanded the area deputy commissioner of police (DCP).

Mohammad Riyaz, president of the Shaheen Bagh residents ’ welfare association, said, “I am grateful to police for clearing the road. In these times of the novel coronavirus scare, it was an important step. Even if one person was infected, it could have spread and worsened the situation. In these tough times, we need to be together to fight this out.”

As police officers, including DCP R P Meena and area assistant commissioner of police Jagdish Yadav, went into inner lanes, many residents came forward to thank them.

Most residents said they were supportive of the police move as the road was vital in connecting the rest of the national capital region to Delhi and other states. Even essential items can be supplied to several bordering cities and states through this route now, one of them said.

Tanvir Jahan, a social worker and a resident of Shaheen Bagh, said, “We were only worried whether the protesters could be removed easily, especially after the recent violence in northeast Delhi. But it went on smoothly and no one showed any resistance.”

The flowers and garlands were given to the policemen as a mark of respect and to show them that local residents were grateful that the site was vacated peacefully, he added. “We’ve had sleepless nights fearing if anything would go wrong. The rising scare of the virus only added to our worries,” he added.

The functioning of the teams has been fixed on a rotation basis,"" said state secretary of Kerala Government Medical College Teachers Association (KGMCTA) Dr Nirmal Bhaskar.

When the first team goes home, the second team will take over Covid-19 duty and the third, which was the standby team, will take over the mantle of other emergency departments.

The present three-tier duty system is helpful since the entire team of doctors will not be put under risk.

KGMCTA has been asking medical education department to put doctors on rotation duty ever since Covid-19 was reported in state.

Apart from this, for the one week duty, three shifts have also been put in place so that one team is not put under strain.

""This is the best practice that can be adopted. This would lessen the burden for the doctors and prevent the risks involved,"" said state secretary of Kerala Government Medical Officers Association Dr G S Vijayakrishnan.

However, doctors are of the opinion that this rotation system will not work if at all there is a community outbreak and there is an increase in the number of patients.

At present, this system works since each hospital is having a limited number of cases. When there are more patients, all doctors will have to be pressed into service.

This, they said, was the best possible scenario.The government’s Covid-19 spokesperson, Subroto Bagchi, said the number might increase up to over 36,000 Covid-19 positive patients in the state. The figure for the country was projected to be at least 58,000 people and a maximum of 10 lakh, Bagchi added.The spokesperson said 3,861 foreign returnees had registered on the 104 helpline and the government portal. Of them, around 100 have shown symptoms of coronavirus. “The government is monitoring their condition,” he said.Bagchi said 45 people — both foreign returnees and their close contacts — were in hospital isolation. The other foreign returnees and their close contacts are in home quarantine.The number of confirmed Covid-19 patients in the state remains two. Their condition is stable.Chief minister Naveen Patnaik announced launch of a new programme — ‘Mo Jeebana (My Life)’ — in which people were encouraged to swear in the name of their family that they would not step out of home. In an emotional appeal, he said, “In the last 20 years, whatever requests I have made, you have responded positively to them. The request I am making today is the most important of all. Do swear in the name of your family not to venture out. If it is urgent, ensure 20 seconds hand-washing on return. Make a video of your pledge and share the same in social media,” he said.Bagchi also asked people to take the lockdown seriously, saying it would be impossible to manage the situation if there was a spurt in corona patients. “In India, there are an average of 70 hospital beds per one lakh population,” he said.During the lockdown, patients needing emergency treatment, healthcare professionals and those involved in essential services can move around. The government will curb all non-essential travel. To ensure compliance with the lockdown, the government has stopped all construction works across the state and closed all parks and non-essential commercial establishments.

145,['25/03/2020'],Long queues persist even after HC order,"Kochi: Almost three years after HC asked Bevco ( Beverages Corporation ) to take steps and avoid long queues in front of its outlets, customers stand within ‘sneezing distance’ of each other even today.

This is happening when administration has issued prohibitory orders under Section 144 to curb the spread of Covid-19. A research by Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that coughing spreads droplets up to 6m, while for sneezing it is 8m and they stay suspended in air for 10 minutes.

In the judgment (WP-C No. 12881/2017) delivered by justice Devan Ramachandran on July 5, 2017, the court had said the failure of Bevco in providing adequate space for customers to buy liquor results in long queues. It is a public nuisance and excise authorities are bound by law to act, the court had said.

The court had said in the judgment, “The singular reason why such long queues are formed and why such queues spill over on to public roads and streets is because Bevco does not retail liquor through shops into which customers can walk in and wait, if required, but through counters which are created by barricading and grilling the entrance area of the licensed shops, effectively forcing the customers to stand outside even on roads and streets on which such shops are situated, thus causing long queues and resultant pandemonium in public space including streets. These queues often cause traffic snarls, brawls and several times unrestrained disorder on public roads and streets.”

The court ordered that Bevco would be the best authority to take remedial measures because it is aware of the logistics involved, the demand and the number of customers.

They fear that many of these labourers, who work in big cities, could be potential carriers of Covid-19.

“Tracking them down from remote villages is a huge task. A bigger exercise is to convince them for screening,” officials said.

Village-level committees comprising patwaris, panchayat employees and rozgar sahayaks (employment assistants) in Chhatarpur, Tikamgarh, Panna, Sagar and Damoh are busy identifying labourers and compiling a list of their names and family members.

For years now, people migrate in droves to Delhi, Mumbai, Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh in search of livelihood. They work at construction sites, agricultural fields, ride rickshaws and autos besides working at brick kilns. Due to this mass migration, many villages only have elderly and children.

“Officials of the district administration are compiling lists. The process of compilation is on. Many of those who have been identified have already been screened and follow up actions are being taken,” said Sheelendra Singh, district collector of Chattarpur.

“Many villagers, who were identified, have been screened for Covid-19 symptoms,” said Saurab Sonwane, SDM of Jatara tehsil in Tikamgarh.

Arrangements are also being made quarantine individuals who test positive for the virus, Sonwane added.

The order finally came on Monday. All papers of HSC are over, while just one paper of SSC (Geography) is now pending. It now seems that by the time Geography exam is held, all papers would have already been evaluated. The state board however clarified that the decision is only for this year.Ashok Gavhankar, general secretary of Vidarbha Junior College Teachers Association (VJUCTA) said, “During a time like this, paper evaluation work should definitely be given to the teachers to finish from home. Right now, containing the outbreak is the priority. Few years ago, the system was like that only but due to certain malpractices, evaluation was mandated from school premises,” said Gavhankar who is also principal of Rao Saheb Thawre High School and Junior College, Nagpur.Madhusudhan Mude, president of Headmasters Association (Nagpur district) said state government’s latest move is a good one. “This will ensure that board results will be declared on time which is extremely important for student to make future plans. Teachers will also remain productive in such a time. However, I don’t feel that this should be made into a norm for the years to come and correct way to evaluate papers is to come to the school and do it,” said Mude who is also principal of Major Hemant Jakate School and Junior College.Dilip Bose, secretary of School Headmasters Charitable Association said the board made a wise decision. “Moving out of home was a dangerous thing to do for teachers. This decision will now protect them from the wrath of coronavirus. Working from home is the need of the hour,” said Bose. Principal of Bhola High School Premlata Tiwari said “It is important to announce the results on time so that there are no hindrances for the student’s future education.”Ashnarayan Tiwari, principal of Adarsh Vidya Mandir said the problem will be to procure answersheets in times of a complete lockdown and hence wants evaluation to be delayed. “If teachers go out to collect papers won’t it be violation of curfew.

150,['25/03/2020'],Hydroxychloroquine pills fly off pharmacy store shelves,"Bhubaneswar: Almost all stocks of hydroxychloroquine, a relatively safe and widely used variant of malaria pill chloroquine, were exhausted in pharmacies across Bhubaneswar on Tuesday, following media reports that the medicine might work as a vaccine for Covid-19. People have not only started buying the medicine for immediate use, they are also hoarding it.

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has recommended hydroxychloroquine as a preventive medicine for high-risk population such as asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of Covid-19 and asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory confirmed cases.

It has also issued an advisory that the drug should be given to customers only on prescription by a registered medical practitioner, but that has not stopped people from getting the medicine at stores.

“The recommendation of hydroxychloroquine by ICMR is based on pre-clinical trials and in-vitro study results. It has been tested with success on animals in laboratories but no human trial has taken place,” said Hyderabad-based pharmacologist M R Singh, who works with a company that deals with clinical trial of drugs. “In the current situation, in which no other effective option is available and human trials are not possible with scientifically accurate results, hydroxychloroquine is one of the very few options available to the people. However, it is only recommended for healthcare workers and first-hand exposure cases,” he added.

Though a few medicine stores are turning away customers asking for the pills, many stores said they were almost out of them. Prakash Sahu, owner of City Medicine Store, said, “We have exhausted our stock of hydroxychloroquine over the past two days. We don’t know why people are buying this medicine. They are showing prescriptions too.”

Similarly, stocks of hydroxychloroquine pills in most of the Apollo Pharmacy stores have been exhausted. “Some genuine patients, who regularly take the pill for treatment of arthritis and lupus, had to return empty-handed as we are out of the pills,” said a salesman at the Apollo Pharmacy store in Unit-IV.

His samples were tested negative on Tuesday. As per protocol, one more test will be conducted in next 24 hours. If this test comes negative, the patient will be allowed to discharge.

However, as district collector Ravindra Thakare has said earlier, the administration will not discharge the patient for next seven days even if he become free from Covid-19 as they want to monitor the patient for one more week.

Doctors collected his swab samples on Tuesday afternoon and they were sent for testing the same day. Sources at the lab facility at IGMMCH informed that the samples were tested negative late in the evening.

Earlier on Tuesday, the patient, who is doing well now, messaged TOI that he was also excited about the test results. “I will let you know,” he messaged.

Meanwhile, Tuesday was the eighth consecutive day on which no suspect was tested positive from Vidarbha region. All 34 samples tested in the morning batch were tested negative. While 26 of these samples were from Nagpur, others were from Chandrapur , Wardha, and Yavatmal .

“What was a weeklong lockdown has now extended up to three weeks and since it is monthend, we don’t have enough essentials at home,” said Sheetal Sheth, who was waiting in a queue outside a grocery store in Prahladnagar. “What if the three-week shutdown is extended further?”

At the main vegetable market in South Bopal just opposite Sobo Centre, people stood in a half-a-kilometre queue for groceries. Similar queues were seen at a milk parlour near Tejas School.

A police official deployed at Vastral said that many people caught breaking the curfew said they were out to buy medicines. “When I asked them to show a prescription or even recall the medicine’s generic name, they were speechless,” said the cop.

At Bhairavi towers in CTM, residents have decided to prevent the entry of all visitors. “We have been distributing herbal medicines in the evening so that other diseases can be prevented,” said Minesh Patel, a resident of the towers.

Following the customer rush, a number of grocery stores and chemists in Prahladnagar and Anandnagar shut shop within minutes, saying that they would reopen the next day.

Barodians too came out in large numbers to shop. At vegetable markets in Sama and Gorwa and other places it was like an everyday scene. Citizens were seen buying vegetables in bulk to ensure the stock lasts them for at least another week. Chaos prevailed despite shopkeepers ensuring everyone that shops will stay open even during the lockdown of 21 days.

A large number of apartment schemes have banned the entry of housemaids, courier delivery boys, food delivery personnel, car washers, etc. Some are not even allowing newspaper delivery boys. Only the milkmen are exempt. Many of these societies are home to millionaires, who have decided to do domestic chores themselves than take the risk of exposing themselves to the pandemic.

Godrej Anandam, a mini-township in Ganeshpeth, which has very rich occupants, has banned the entry of outsiders except the relatives of flat owners. Even family friends are not allowed.

The executive body of Rachana Sahil Apartments, Subhash Nagar, on Monday banned entry of domestic helps, car washers, delivery boys, etc. Only those delivering newspapers and milk will be allowed entry. They will have to sanitize themselves before entering the premises. There were some flat owners who opposed the decision but they were overruled by the majority.

Monali Mudholkar of Narhari Residency, Mangaldeep Nagar, Besa Road, said her society had banned entry of outsiders to reduce the risk of coronavirus and help government in battling the pandemic. “Household helps do not come under essential services. Most flat occupants are at home as schools, colleges, offices and factories are shut. Hence we decided to do domestic chores ourselves. The government is doing its job and we citizens must also contribute,” she said.

Suchitra Mange of Tech-Op Laxmi Apartment, Tirupati Nagar, Koradi Road, said that her society office-bearers had also decided to ban entry of outsiders. “I am facing problems because I am not well and I have small kids. However, these are not normal times.”

Dhiraj Khandelwal of Rachna Srushti Apartments, KT Nagar, said that the decision had been taken for the safety of the flat owners as well as that of maids. “We told the maids how to keep themselves safe when they are at home,” he said.

Some other flat schemes where maids and delivery boys are no longer allowed are: Rachana Aangan (Jaitala Road), Capitol Heights (Imambada), Pioneer Regency (KT Nagar), Shiv Society (Besa), Patrakar Colony (Civil Lines), etc.

The ban on maids is causing problems for many people. A female media personnel had to take leave as her mother recently had an operation and her daughter is very young. Both the nurse and child’s maid were not allowed entry. A lady doctor’s husband, who is now at home, is having difficulty handling their two small kids. There are several senior citizens living alone who depend upon domestic help for everything from cooking to purchasing essential items.

The government has asked collectors, municipal commissioners and executive officers of all 114 urban local bodies (ULBs) to make arrangements accordingly.

In an order, Vishal Dev, OSD to chief secretary Asit Tripathy, asked the authorities to involve field-level functionaries of various departments for smooth delivery of ration and old-age pension to the people. The state government had earlier said beneficiaries under the National Social Assistance Programme and the Madhu Babu Pension Yojana would get four months’ (April-July) pension. The government had also said both urban and rural beneficiaries would get three months’ ration (5 kg of rice/wheat at Re 1 per person per month).

“People don’t need to come to fair price shops or panchayats/urban local bodies to collect their ration or pension. The collectors have been asked to make arrangements so that beneficiaries get them at their houses. There should not be any overcrowding at the distribution points,” said a senior government official.

With announcement of the lockdown, the state government on Tuesday ordered immediate stoppage of all construction work across the state, except those of healthcare facilities or related to Covid-19.

Chief minister Naveen Patnaik, in a recent video-conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had asked for a relief package for construction workers. On Tuesday, Union labour minister Santosh Gangwar asked all chief ministers to provide financial aid to construction workers from construction cess.

158,['25/03/2020'],"Nagpur markets deserted, prices of fruits &amp; veggies skyrocket","NAGPUR: With the entire state under curfew, most of the markets in the city wore a deserted look on Tuesday. “The markets are not the same any more in the light of social distancing advisory to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Sales have drastically dropped due to virtually no footfall,” said Dilip Yadav, who owns a wholesale grocery shop on Koradi Road.

In the wholesale grain markets in Itwari , which are usually packed with people, the narrow lanes were uncharacteristically deserted. Streets that are usually swarmed by people had hardly any customers in sight.

The sale of fruits and vegetables has drastically dropped even in local vegetable markets like Khamla, Gokulpeth, and Itwari as a result of the low footfall. Many shopkeepers sold vegetables at discounted rates fearing that these would rot and turn into waste, said vegetable vendor Rajnath Sahu.

To maintain social distancing at local markets, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation has used chalks and demarcated lines outside every unit in almost all markets.

Amit Hoshing, a resident of Trimurti Nagar, said the prices of vegetables have increased sharply. He, however, admitted that there was no choice left and appreciated the efforts of district & civic administrations and city police for allowing shops of essential commodities like vegetables, grocery etc to remain open during the lockdown period.

Akash Hubalkar, a fruit vendor, said the demand for fruits has gone down drastically. “From Monday itself, we stopped bringing fruits from Kalamna wholesale market,” he said and claimed to have spotted wholesale vendors dumping tonnes of oranges and watermelons as garbage.

Shalu Gupta, a vegetable vendor from Khamla Road, said, “As we could not afford sanitizers and masks, we are using clothes as masks,” he said. Like Gupta, most vegetable vendors here have started covering their face with cloth.

Even orders at food chains, especially kitchen restaurants, have dropped drastically. Owner of a kitchen restaurant from Sadar, requesting anonymity, said that online food orders have dropped since Monday. Prashant Sahare , a professional and a bachelor staying in an apartment in KT Nagar, said that he continues to get food online since his firm has asked him to work from home.

A total of 426 persons were detained and were later released during the lockdown.

“A few complaints about the problems faced by the citizens have come to our notice and we are trying to resolve it. I want to appeal to the people of Gujarat to avoid going out unnecessarily and adhere to the social distancing even when you are out to get essential goods and services. Societies should form groups to ensure that there is no crowding,” said Jha.

The DGP announced formation of a special control room to keep an eye on the lockdown conditions and redress any issues arising during its implementation. “The entire initiative would be supervised by two ADGP-level officers. If the citizens face any unnecessary issue, they can contact respective police stations or police control room numbers,” said Jha.

Jha said that there were a few reports of stopping media and a few trucks of essential supplies in Ahmedabad. “We will discuss the issues with city police commissioners and district SPs during our video conference today,” he said.

He said that police on duty are also taking adequate precautions including wearing masks and washing hands frequently.

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat government has decided to promote all students of Classes 1 to 9 and 11 to higher standards without examinations. The decision was taken because of the uncertainty brought by the lockdown and the spread of COVID-19 in Gujarat.

Ashwani Kumar, the secretary to the CM, told the media on Tuesday: “The decision has been taken to ensure students’ safety.”

Examinations in primary schools were scheduled in March and April. The state government had earlier this month announced the closure of all educational institutes including schools, colleges, and tuition classes across the state until March 29.

The state government cancelled the final examinations after pressure mounted on it to do so in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The president of the School Management Association, Bhaskar Patel, said: “We had been telling the authorities not to insist on exams and exempt students from this formality.” Patel went on to say: “Any kind of gathering has become dangerous. It is good that the administration has finally heeded our demand.” More than 70 lakh students in nearly 55,000 schools across the state have been exempted from the final exams.

In Gujarat, this will be the fifth instance of school students being given mass promotions. It happened in 1974 during the Navnirman agitation; in 1985 during the anti-reservation riots; in 2001 after the earthquake; and in 2002 after the post-Godhra riots.

The state government has also withheld its plan to start the new academic session in April and said that it will roll out the plan from next year.

The circular issued by the education department also exempts all teaching and non-teaching staff from going to schools, unless they are specifically assigned work either by the state government or by the local administration. They will have to strictly follow instructions issued to them in future by the administration.

The teaching and non-teaching staff in self-financed schools has been exempted from school duties as well.

Sources said that a section in the education department wanted an early vacation for teachers and wanted them to resume their duties much before the summer vacation concludes, but the state government discarded the proposal.

BHOPAL: Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Tuesday trained his guns on former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia whose supporters including 22 MLAs resigned bringing down the 15-month Kamal Nath government.

Singh tweeted an open letter for the people of Madhya Pradesh . “Recently, Jyotiraditya Scindia defected to BJP causing the fall of Congress government in Madhya Pradesh. I am sad that he joined BJP at a juncture, when its divisive agenda is exposed to all,” he said in the open letter.

“Ït is being said that he had lost hope of a suitable post and honour within the Congress party. But this is untrue. If he indeed wanted to be the MPCC president, then he could have taken over in 2013, when this post was offered to him. But he preferred to remain a Union minister,” Singh said.

“Ïn 2018, he was offered post of deputy CM, but he declined and instead, proposed the name of Tulsi Silawat .”

Singh also took on the RSS and said: “Today Congress politics is not just about power, it is also about confronting Sangh ideology. These two ideologies visualise India differently. The future of India now depends on the victory of one of these ideologies. That is why, the loss of Congress government has pained not just Congress workers but all the common citizens also, who are struggling against the hegemony of RSS philosophy,”the Congress leader wrote.

165,['25/03/2020'],Animals relieved as this zoo in Tamil Nadu shut for visitors,"Vandalur Zoo

CHENNAI: The animals and birds at the Vandalur zoo have never been seen in such a relaxed mood, say their keepers.

From K Chellaiah, who is in charge of the white tigers’ enclosure, to M Nagammal, who takes care of the enclosures for deer and the regular tigers, almost every staff member says life for the animals has been most peaceful since March 17 when the zoo was shut over Covid-19 fears.

This is the second time the facility has been closed for a long time. The first time was from January 23 to February 23 in 2002, when a wild leopard strayed into the zoo and the authorities trapped it after a month.

The present situation, though comfortable for the animals, could prove costly for the zoo in terms of revenue, say officials. They, however, admit that the behaviour of the visitors, some of them unruly, causes a lot of strain for the animals.

From 9.45am, when the gates are opened and the first visitors stream in, to when the zoo is closed, the animals are subjected to almost continuous noise. Some try to get as close to the enclosures as possible to take selfies; others shout and clap to draw the attention of the animals. A few others even throw stones at the animals, sometimes hurting them and causing a lot of stress. All this, says

renowned veterinarian N Kalaivanan, leads to loss of natural behaviour for animals and their stress levels go up.

A good example is the Sariska reserve in Rajasthan where the huge number of vehicles affected the reproductive system of tigers and their numbers in Central India fell significantly, he said.

“When animals in captivity are not disturbed, their wild behaviour is restored. Their physiological behaviour is also good and helps in better functioning of their reproductive system,” he said.

Now, Chelliah says, with no visitors to disturb them, the white tigers have been frolicking with their cubs happily.

Nagammal agrees and says the sambar deer, in particular, react instantly to noise and sometimes abandon their feed. No such instances have occurred in the past one week, she says.

It is not only the carnivores such as tigers and leopards that are stressed. Even small mammals such as mongoose and palm civet among a host of animals too get affected badly, Kalaivanan said. That may return when the zoo is ultimately opened, he added.

Senior police officers said that the goods have been seized as case property and South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) and public works department (PWD) have been asked to start the repair work of the damaged stretch. A survey will be conducted for restoration work to begin.

Meanwhile, the graffiti on the walls at the anti-CAA-NRC protest site outside Jamia Millia Islamia were whitewashed by some unknown people on Tuesday. While no organisation claimed to having done it, Jamia students alleged that it was done by policemen who had gone there to remove the tents.

A senior SDMC official said a team of 35 people used five auto-tippers to carry the waste and debris from Shaheen Bagh. Another 15 people and three tippers were used at the Jamia protest site. “These roads are more than 60-feet wide and belong to PWD, so the repair work of signage, central verge and road furniture will be carried out by them,” he added.

Rajpal, deputy chairperson of SDMC standing committee, said penalties would be imposed on people responsible for causing damage worth crores to public property.

A senior PWD official said that police have asked them to wait till Thursday to start work in case some retaliation occurs on Wednesday. “The money spent on restoring the stretch will be used from the maintenance fund of Delhi government,” he added.

The graffiti had come up on the Jamia campus walls after the violence on December 15. The Jamia administration denied having any knowledge of the whitewashing. “The proctor told me that 40-50 people came in the morning and without informing us started to paint over the graffiti,” said Ahmed Azeem, Jamia media coordinator.

Jamia’s Joint Coordination Committee member Alameen Kabir said, “The protest has been called off temporarily. We will be back after the Covid-19 pandemic ends and so will the graffiti.” JCC, in its press statement, also alleged that police took away the relief material kept for riot victims.

Delhi Police, SDMC and PWD denied having any knowledge about the whitewashing.

Track the pollution level in your city

Met officials said a western disturbance is influencing parts of north-west India, which could bring a spell of very light rain in the next few days too. The maximum temperature on Tuesday was 33 degrees Celsius, two notches above normal, while the minimum was 18.6 degrees Celsius, a notch below normal.

“Light rain along with thunderstorm is likely in Delhi-NCR in the next couple of days due to the western disturbance. The wind speed would be around 25-30 km per hour. Dust storm or thunderstorm accompanied with light rain is expected on Friday along with wind at a speed of 30-40 km per hour. The temperature will remain around 31 degrees,” Kuldeep Srivastava, head of regional centre at the India Meteorological Department (IMD), said.

The increased wind speed and light rain have further aided in decreasing Delhi’s pollution levels, which, despite remaining in the ‘moderate’ range, are expected to drop to ‘satisfactory’ in the next 24 hours.

The AQI on Tuesday was 122, similar to Monday’s 124, categorised as moderate according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)’s index.

As per CPCB, Delhi-NCR’s average PM2.5 levels were recorded at 61.1 micrograms per cubic metre at 9pm on Tuesday, just above the safe standards. The average PM10 levels were recorded at 122.2 micrograms per cubic metre the same time. The “emergency” benchmark for these pollutants under GRAP is, respectively, 300 and 500 micrograms per cubic metre, while the safe standards are 60 and 100 micrograms per cubic metre.

“The AQI is likely to be at the higher end of satisfactory to lower end of moderate category on Wednesday. The satisfactory category is forecasted for Thursday and Friday, too,” a SAFAR report stated.

172,['25/03/2020'],Govt’s 104 helpline a bulwark in virus fight,"Bhubaneswar: The state government’s 104 helpline number has become a major shield to stop spreading of novel coronavirus in the state. It is not only registering names of the persons returning from Covid-19-affected countries, but is giving medical advice during their quarantine or isolation period.

According to state government’s chief spokesperson on Covid-19 Subroto Bagchi, 104 is like a moat around a fort. “It helps us fight against the spread of coronavirus,” he had told mediapersons while discussing about the helpline two days ago. This helpline, launched in 2015, has been receiving around 500 calls per day, but now the call centre is getting more than 7,000 calls a day. It may increase further.

Works secretary Krishan Kumar, who is overseeing the helpline, said, “The 104 helpline number is helpful in storing database of people returning from Covid-19-affected countries. There were around 45 people in the call centre, but now we have strengthened the centre by engaging 150 people.”

As many people ask for doctor consultation, the government has created a team of doctors, led by retired director of health Saroj Nayak. To assist him, 14 doctors have been deployed in the centre to provide consultation over phone to people under home quarantine or isolation. The doctor team and 150 members of call centre sit at Smart City office. The government has also set up an outbound call centre to act on the information received through the 104 helpline. It has been set up at Odisha Computer Application Centre (OCAC).

“Main purpose of the centre is to call the people in quarantine or home isolation twice a day and take feedback from them. More than 150 persons are handling the calls and seven doctors, including senior professor Braja Das, are giving medical advice to the people, an official said.

If any person wants to talk to a doctor about symptoms or anything related to Covid-19, the professionals at the centre forward the call to a doctor. They also suggest the people, who return to Odisha from other states, to talk to the local administration and report if they find any symptoms of infection.

The number of calls made to 104 helpline from 7am on Monday to 7am on Tuesday was 11,187. A total 3,816 persons returned from abroad have registered with the state government through the 104 helpline and ‘covid19.odisha.gov.in’ portal by 7am on Tuesday.

Besides, people can report to state control room (0674-2390466) or to state surveillance officer (9439994857, 9439994859). The government agencies, including Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC), have issued helpline number 1929 to address issues faced by residents during the lockdown period, but nobody picked up call in this number on Monday. This correspondent called this number eight times between 10.25am and 4.19pm on Monday. The response was either “Sorry, the network is congested’, or “Sorry, there is no reply from the number you have called”.

BMC deputy commissioner (sanitation) Subhendu Sahu had said, “The problem happens when many users call at a time. A caller should try more than once to get connected.” The number was found working on Tuesday.

173,['25/03/2020'],"Anti-CAA protests ‘take a break’ in western UP, to resume after Covid-19 is defeated","Meerut/Agra/Bareilly: After Delhi and Lucknow, women protesters staging round-the-clock sit-in against CAA and NRC withdrew their stir in all cities of western UP, but with a rider that they will resume it once the novel coronavirus is wiped out. The “conditional break” was achieved after a lot of persuasion by police, authorities and religious leaders who termed large-scale gathering as unsafe amid the threat posed by novel coronavirus.

In Deoband, a town in UP’s Saharanpur district housing one of the world’s largest Islamic seminaries, a protest was going on for the last 57 days. On Tuesday, it was discontinued. However, the protesting women left their bangles and ‘burqas’ at the protest site, Eidgah ground, under the “guard of CCTV cameras”.

“We will resume the stir from April 5. Until then, no one will touch these burqas and bangles or else we would resume our agitation, then and there,” one of the protesters said. Over 500 women were at the sit-in site at any given time for the last almost two months in Deoband’s Eidgah, making it the largest protest site in UP.

According to Vidyasagar Mishra, Saharanpur superintendent of police (rural), “We had been talking to the representatives of this agitation for some time. On the day of janata curfew, the attendance became thin. And on late Monday night, they finally agreed with some conditions.”

Fozia Usmani, a member of Mutahida Khawatin Committee (MKC), the organising committee of the ‘dharna’, said, “We are leaving our bangles and burqas behind as our symbolic presence. We are only leaving the place for time being to mitigate chances of community spread of novel coronavirus.”

In Aligarh’s Shahjamal area, another major protest site in the state, the agitation was called off on Tuesday. The protesters were staging the sit-in for the last 57 days. They vacated the protest site after getting a “written” assurance from police that their tents and other items will not be removed from ‘dharna’ site, as they will resume the sit-in after spread of the virus is controlled.

City magistrate Vineet Kumar Singh, who was present at the site, said, “The protesters were told about the health issues and they agreed to vacate the site.” When asked about any kind of assurance given to the protesters, Singh refused to comment.

“Our priority is to check the spread of Covid-19,” the officer said.

“This is only temporary, and we will be back once the situation is under control,” said one of the protesters, adding that the protest against the government will continue till they accept their demand to withdraw Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

In Moradabad also, Eidgah was cleared of protesters. Additional superintendent of police (city) said that tents and other things have been removed from the sit-in site. Similarly, superintendent of police in Sambhal said that all protesting women have gone back to their homes calling off the protest there.

“Today, we reached among the protesters and interacted with them after which, except a few, everyone was ready to go back to their homes. Later, rest of them also vacated the spot and we cleared the ground after uprooting tents. An FIR was lodged against 12 named and 160 unknown people for their stubborn attitude,” ASP Amit Kumar Anand said. Earlier in the morning, the DM also gave the example of Shaheen Bagh of Delhi where anti-CAA protesters called off their protest on Tuesday morning.

The four positive cases of Gandhinagar are of the same extended family — a man and his wife, sister-in-law, and maternal uncle. While the couple had travelled to Dubai, the other two got in touch with them and got infected.

“The couple initially told the health department that they had come in contact with about 54 persons,” said a health department official. “All the persons were tracked and their health was recorded. However, the couple had not mentioned a senior citizen, who is also a pharmacist at a government-run health centre. That case turned out to be positive.”

Due to the case, a special team has been formed consisting of officials from the collector’s office, police, and municipal corporation to track down all the persons who might have come in contact with the four.

DEHRADUN: Amid the statewide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus, a leopard was found holed up in a vacant private school building in Rishikesh on Tuesday.

The animal, aged around three to four years, was tranquilised after an operation of around four hours. A forest department staffer was however injured in the process and admitted to AIIMS Rishikesh.

Meanwhile, forest officials have urged the state government to include the forests and wildlife department in the list of ‘essential services’ during the lockdown. A senior official told TOI, “This is the time when poachers will try to make money as they hardly have any other source of income. ”

Another IFS officer said, “Patrolling has reduced significantly in areas surrounding forests due to the lockdown. This is likely to cause a spike in human-animal conflict. Also, who will tackle forest fires in the coming days if the department is not exempted from the restrictions?” Notably, the Forest Survey of India has given out over 35 forest fire alerts to Uttarakhand this month alone.

My wife supports what I do.”The lockdown will affect not just humans but animals too. On Monday, Maneka Gandhi appealed on Twitter, requesting people to feed animals. “In the event of a lockdown, if they are not fed, many will die, creating another serious problem. I have asked all animal welfare workers to feed the animals during this period. I will be doing the same,” she wrote.Animal welfare activists in the city and other individuals have risen to the challenge. With hotels shut, stray animals in the city are finding it difficult to find food. If many starve and die, it will worsen the situation.At shelters, volunteers and staff are staying on to do their bit. “Twenty two of us, including two vets, two volunteers and Blue Cross staff will stay at the shelter to care for the sick and injured animals. We have 1,263 animals and have to ensure they are fed nutritious meals, and get exercise. We also have to attend to the upkeep of the shelter and go on rescues,” says Dawn Williams , general manager, Blue Cross.Dinesh Baba, who runs Cloud No 9 Kennel and Nursing Care, is providing cooked food to street animals. “On Monday, I cooked about 75kg of dog food, and fed strays,” says Dinesh, who commutes from Porur to Injambakkam every day.Sumita Pai, who lives in Alwarpet, has been regularly feeding birds and community animals but plans to make a more concerted effort during the lockdown. “I will follow all government guidelines and directives. I will feed the animals on my own and step out only for a brief period,” she says.Animal lovers say it is necessary to feed strays but do so in a responsible manner. “You can feed animals in your locality so you don’t have to step out much. Also, do not do it in groups, social distancing is must,” says Dinesh.In a related development, the Animal Welfare Board of India wrote to all the chief secretaries of all the states and UTs, saying that it had come to their notice that a large number of pet shops or animal breeding facilities where animals and birds are kept for sale are now shutdown. ""The animals stranded in such places are likely to suffer and die without food, water, temperature control, etc. All such pet shops are to be evacuated by the State Animal Welfare Boards through SPCAs.

COIMBATORE: Walayar check post was crowded on Tuesday with several hundreds of Tamils returning to the state from Kerala, where they are employed, since morning following the announcement on imposition of Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Similarly, there was an outflow of Keralites, who have been working in the state, to their hometowns through the check post. They were all allowed in or out only after screening.

A public health department official said the rural police and doctors were deployed at Walayar check post to screen the people who were travelling in and out. “People were allowed in only after verifying that they are the citizens of the state. The crowd was too large for the team of doctors, who were deployed there, to handle. They really had a tough time screening the people travelling in and out. People were advised to maintain distance, but they hardly paid heed to the doctors’ advice.”

The official said the crowd wasn’t aware about the seriousness of Covid-19.

Dr Azhagu Rajamani, assistant director, public health department, Coimbatore, said they had been screening people at Walayar check post for the past 10 days. “The government invoked CrPC Section 144 to avoid large gathering at a place. But thousands of people gathered at the check post on Tuesday. Some of them used ambulance to shift people to Tamil Nadu from Kerala. It’s an offence. People should stay at home.” He said all the vehicles were stopped at the check post and that they were allowed in or out only after screening.

Goutham, a native of Ooty, said the health department should have appointed more staff at the check post for screening. “I had to cross Mettupalayam, Coonoor and Ooty check posts to reach my hometown. The screening process was too slow.”

However, the district administration closed the border on Salem-Kochi bypass road exactly at 6pm and vehicles were not allowed to enter the district. Similarly, all roads leading to inter-state borders were blocked at 6pm.

The district administration, meanwhile, warned to book people, who violate Section 144, under the epidemic diseases act. It said the objective of imposing Section 144 was to maintain social distancing and take precautions to contain Covid-19.

City police commissioner Sumit Sharan said only a maximum of five people could gather at one place. “They have to tell us the purpose. If anyone is deliberately coming out of houses to roam around the city, we will book them under relevant sections of law.”

On his part, collector K Rajamani appealed the public to extent their cooperation to implement Section 144 effectively in the district. “Violators will be booked under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. Medical shops should not sell face masks and hand sanitizers at a high price. If they do, shop owners will be booked under the act and their licence will be cancelled.”

Enterprising shops too have seized the opportunity to cash in on the situation by keeping ready enough stocks in the last few days.``When we were kids, we would sit down for a game of cards after dad came back from work, mostly after dinner every day,’’ said T Kumar of Anna Nagar . But he rues that such habits had become forgotten today as children rarely find time to leave their phones and get family time.Parents say they are thinking of ways to ensure the participation of everybody at home. Poornima of Anna Nagar said they had bought board games such as scrabble, ludo and monopoly. ``This is the first time we are actually buying games which we can play together and not just gift them to others. Besides, these games are great stress-busters,’’ she said. Many young parents have found that they did not know the rules of several of these board games as well as their parents did. Hence, these games end up as contests between children and grandparents in many homes.Some small shops which opened on Tuesday saw people enquiring about cards such as UNO and the regular as well as ordinary cards. ``We don’t keep more than five packs at a time but they were all sold out last week,’’ said Thirupathy , a shopkeeper in K K Nagar. ``I didn’t know my grandfather could play games so well. He is a master at carrom and beat all of us on all the days we played,’’ said 16-year-old Sudhesh for whom his 80-year-old grandfather’s finger strength came as a revelation.Children are also into colouring together and pulling out jigsaw puzzles from their cupboards in many homes. Mohan Raj, owner of Freak Sports in Madurai , said he had sold 200 carom boards in three days.``Usually we sell about 30 boards per month but now there is a boom in sales. Since I also make boards, I have been able to supply them, but other shops have run out of stock,’’ he said.On Tuesday, a consignment of 60 boards came to the shop in the morning of which 58 were sold off like hot cakes by evening.

NEW DELHI: It was a race against time for a 64-year old man who urgently needed to be taken to a hospital for a dialysis. Ashok Goyal, a resident of northeast Delhi’s Vijay Park lived alone. One Tuesday morning, he tried to catch a bus to reach the hospital but failed. After he was unable to get an ambulance either, a policeman helped him receive the treatment.

Speaking to TOI, Ashok Goyal said, “I have been a dialysis patient for the last six years. Thrice a week I need to go for dialysis to Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital in Tahirpur.”

He said that the patrol cops were asking people to stay indoors at the bus stop. “I was carrying my medical bag and showed my papers to them. However, in the meantime the bus left before I could board it,” he said. “I sat on the edge of a footpath and called 112 for an ambulance.

Goyal said he waited for over an hour but the ambulance never came. “As I can’t afford to miss my sessions, I panicked. Some media people also tried calling ambulance for me but to no avail,” he said.

A call to DCP northeast Ved Prakash Surya, however, showed results. Additional DCP Sukant Ballabh was patrolling the area and immediately reached Goyal. The patient reached the hospital in time in the cop’s car.

“I am grateful to police for saving me in this need of hour.” added Goyal. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also appreciated the efforts of the police officer and praised him on Twitter.

Q. I am sure you have never been through this kind of situation before. How are you coping with it?

A. Yes. But it is our job. Monitoring so much of manpower and material being used to bring the situation under control is quite a task, but I am happy that people in place of talking to helpline no. are talking to me. You won't believe it, my mobile was charged seven times a day in the past couple of days.

Q. Do you want to say anything to people?

A. I want to tell people forcefully, ""Don't ask for exemption. Stay at home.”

Q. Where do you see the situation heading from here?

A. I feel, if the people show self-discipline and observe the protocol they are being told, the situation may become normal soon. But if they are not serious about it, the situation may also worsen. I hope with the cooperation of people we shall be able to overcome the Coronavirus threat soon.

While passenger trains have been cancelled, the freight trains are running to supply foodgrain, coal, milk, vegetables and other essentials across the country.

Freight trains are running faster than their usual speed, said general manager of North Central Railway (NCR) and Northern Railway (NR) Rajeev Chaudhary in video message on Tuesday. He said, “In order to keep services operational, hundreds of thousands employees of the Indian Railways are working day and night to ensure that movement of essential supplies are not hampered and life of common man is not made more difficult. Passenger trains have been stopped only to promote social distancing to curb the virus from spreading in the community.”

Additional divisional manager, Moradabad division of Northern Railway, Maan Singh Meena said he has written to district authorities, asking them to allow railway staff to reach their place of work without any hassles due to the lockdown in many districts. He said since all passenger trains have stopped running, police are under the impression that there is no work for the railway staff. “Railways is working 24x7. Goods trains are still running and in order to maintain traffic movement and other related work, all railway employees are on duty,” he clarified.

201,['25/03/2020'],Lockdown is for your own safety: DIG Wali,"TOI Conversation D.I.G Irshad Wali PICS: Rajeev Sarathe

Bhopal: Just after hectic duty due to the high-voltage political crisis in Bhopal, which lingered on for around three weeks, city cops were pressed into relentless service to enforce restrictions amid the Covid-19 outbreak that led to the ‘janata curfew’, followed by a total lockdown and curfew.

TOI talked to DIG Irshad Wali over the extraordinary situation. Excerpts from the interview

Q: Although you are known to be a workaholic, what are your present working hours?

DIG Wali: My working hours are not fixed. I start working since 6am and am engaged till 2.30am at night. I monitor the situation across the city and give necessary instructions. People do not understand that the lockdown is for their own safety. Despite the lockdown, many Bhopalis are hell-bent on coming out and also seek every facility.

Q: You meet a lot of people during the day and are exposed to health risks. How do you manage yourself?

DIG Wali: One has to deal with it. I change my clothes and take a thorough bath as soon as I reach home.

Q: There are reports that you stayed at the police control room the whole night. Is it true?

DIG Wali: Yes. On Sunday night Bhopal district collector Tarun Pithode and I decided to stay at the police control room. If police and administration get information of a single coronavirus positive case entering the city by flight or any other route, they need to plan accordingly.

Q: What measures have been taken to avoid infection of the deadly coronavirus among the police force?

DIG Wali: We planned it around 7-8 days back, even before the advisories were issued before the lockdown and placed sanitizers at police stations. Masks have been provided to the police staff. Efforts are on to provide them sanitizers and masks individually once again. I myself briefed the force on precautions to be taken to avoid the deadly infection.

Q: Cops were already stressed due to the rigorous law and order duty during the recent political crisis in the state and are now enforcing a curfew. How do you plan to rotate the staff?

DIG Wali: Definitely, the staff is stressed, and we have asked for additional force from the police headquarters. Police is one department which only gets criticism. We try to motivate our staff. People try to find fault in us. If policemen enforce lockdown, ask for papers, they are severely criticised. People should take this unprecedented situation positively. It is a matter of life and death. People move out of their homes for silly reasons — just to take a glance at the empty roads during curfew. People should understand that the energy of police staff is also limited, and they get frustrated after a certain point of time.

HYDERABAD: More than 100 flat owners have approached the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Hyderabad, urging it to declare Emaar Hills Township Project Ltd insolvent by initiating corporate insolvency process against the company.

They believe this is the only way-out to make Emaar company deliver their villas and flats at Gachibowli as promised. The dream project of several home buyers a decade ago later turned into a major scam with CBI arresting several accused in the case, including IAS officers.

T Sudhakar, counsel for the home buyers, said the wait has become too much and they have now approached the tribunal seeking a direction to Emaar to complete construction and hand over the villas. CBI and the Enforcement Directorate unearthed the Rs 100-crore scam and narrated how the tainted money had gone into the hands of certain individuals with fictitious companies.

It may be recalled CBI, which probed the deal, filed a chargesheet in the trial court charging Emaar-MGF chief Sravan Gupta along with kingpin Koneru Rajendra Prasad with turning the project into a huge scam. Many of the buyers were NRIs, who invested crorers of rupees to own villas. The other accused were Vijay Raghava and Sunil Reddy of South-end Projects. Dubai-based Emaar PJSC had originally entered into an agreement with the then Andhra Pradesh government to develop villas, but later allowed firms like MGF to use its name. The charge against the IAS officers was that they allowed 500 acres of government property in Gachibowli to go into the hands of players like MGF which committed fraud. Gupta, who obtained a conditional permission from the CBI court to go abroad, has gone absconding in the last five years. Senior counsel P Venugopal, who appeared for Emaar, sought transfer of all Emaar cases to one bench.

With NCLT also beset with coronavirus scare, sources said the Emaar case is likely to be heard at a later stage.

Volunteers had donated thousands of rupees worth masks, gloves, liquid soap and sprayers to carry out disinfectant works.

Recently, the corporation released a poster requesting people to donate disinfection items.

Pointing out that items like masks and gloves are on high demand, he said they had placed preorder and purchased reusable cloth masks from a Tirupur-based garment factory as most of the shops had already run out of masks. We had already purchased over 1,000 masks from the garment factory and have placed more orders to Pasumai Angai, who had put up a stall in front of corporation main office at Town Hall , he added.

S Natrajan from the federation said that they were acting only as a bridge to meet out the demands and many people have come forward to donate things.

Meanwhile, the corporation is looking for sponsors to arrange transportation facilities for the sanitary workers. As most of the workers are staying in faraway places like Vellalore, Kovaipudur and Malumichampatti, it would be difficult for them to travel to the assigned wards when the state government has suspended all the public transportation.

The big cat was first spotted two days ago at Chandupur village, 3 km from the present location.

Forest authorities suspect that the tigress could be pregnant and is out of the forest to find a safe place to give birth to cubs and protect them from adult male tigers who tend to kill them.

Divisional forest officer, forest and wildlife division, Sanjeev Kumar said the tigress may have strayed out of Barahi forest range of PTR.

Praveen Khare, sub divisional forest officer of PTR’s Puranpur forest circle, said a nylon net had been encircled around three sides of the field to enable the tigress to retreat into the forest.

HYDERABAD: CM K Chandrasekhar Rao on Tuesday announced that the crucial agriculture and dairy sectors in rural areas have been exempted from the purview of the lockdown, and that MGNREGA and irrigation works would also continue.

“Agriculture and dairy in rural areas will remain unaffected until further orders to ensure regular supply of food and milk to the people. However, more than five farmers will not be allowed to gather at any one place and it would be ensured that they maintain a distance of atleast five feet,” said the chief minister.

To ensure that farmers do not gather at the procurement centres and market committees located in towns, the government has decided to set up procurement centres in each village. “Procurement centres will go to the doorsteps of the farmers. A centre to procure paddy will be set up in each of the 12,751 villages in the state. To prevent farmers from gathering at procurement centres, token system with time slots would be given,” said an official.

Though the lockdown and economic slowdown have dented the state’s revenues, the state government will spend Rs 25,000 crore to procure paddy seeds from farmers. The CM minister has issued directions to the finance ministry in this regard. The state is expecting bumper paddy crop of over 70.7 lakh metric tonnes.

Bareilly: Taking a precautionary measure, Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) has suspended the out-patient department (OPD) services at its polyclinic to avoid big gathering with the number of novel coronavirus cases increasing across the country.

“There is no evidence that the contact with animals can infect humans with coronavirus, but the OPD services have been suspended to avoid big gathering on the campus,” said scientists.

According to IVRI authorities, more than 150 people visit the OPD with their animals daily.

IVRI director RK Singh said, “The OPD services at the polyclinic have been suspended, but the emergency facility is fully functional. The decision has been taken to avoid large gathering as a preventive measure against novel coronavirus spread. However, a few people are still visiting the polyclinic OPD with their animals and we are providing services to them. We will review the situation after a few days and if the condition improves, we will resume the OPD services.”

Talking about the spread of corona infection through animals, Singh said, “People should not be scared of coming in contact with animals as there is no evidence which can suggest that animals transmit the virus.”

According to sources, the state government has sought personal protective equipment (PPE) kits from IVRI to give it to hospitals dealing with Covid-19.

When asked, Singh said, “On the request of state government, we will provide 25 PPE kits to them.”

Meanwhile, the Bareilly mental hospital, too, has suspended the OPD services.

COIMBATORE: Taxi and auto drivers in the city said the imposition of CrPC Section 144, which would be in force until April 1 morning, would hit their earnings hard. Pointing out that they won’t be able to pay EMI on their vehicle loans, they urged the state government to help them by directing banks and other non-banking financial companies to offer them moratorium on loan repayment till the situation improved.

There are more than 3,000 taxi drivers in the city, some of who have tied up with app-based cabs. According to them, their woes started on Sunday when the entire nation shut itself down for janata curfew. Since then, the number of rides has come down by 10 times drastically, they said.

T G Sivanath, a taxi driver, said earlier he used to earn anywhere between Rs 1,800 and Rs 2,500 a day. “But since the curfew, my earnings have plunged to Rs 200 a day. There is no hope of getting any rides in the coming days as Section 144 would be in place.” The state, in its notification on Section 144, has exempted only those taxis running to and from airports, hospitals and residences. In this scenario, Sivanath said, they won’t get long rides.

P Babu, another taxi driver, said earlier he used to get 17 to 18 trips in the city in 10 hours. He had been roaming around the city idly in his vehicle for the past three days, barring occasional trips. “I usually shell out Rs 500 daily on fuel. But in the past three days I have spent only Rs 300 and that too i couldn’t recover from the trips,” he said.

The drivers said they had mailed the cab aggregator firms, which replied that they were mulling ways to help the former. They appealed to the state to take cognizance of their situation and direct banks and non-banking financial entities to give them moratorium on loan repyment until everything returned to normalcy.

Similarly, there are around 13,000 auto-rickshaws in the city and another 2,000 in rural parts. P K Sugumaran, general secretary, Coimbatore District Auto Workers’ Union, said, “Their livelihood is also at stake. It is only fair that the state announces a moratorium on loan repayment.”

Due to the on-going lockdown and almost absent public transport system, hundreds of workers walked several kilometres to reach their home, only to face what some described “disheartening” situation.

“There was a time when my friends used to wait for me to come home. We used to spend days together. But now, the same friends are scared of me, they are not even talking to me. I was asked to get a no-coronavirus certificate before entering the village. Amid uncertainty about our future after losing work, the behaviour of our own people is really disheartening,” Kumar said over phone.

When contacted, emergency medical officer Dr Mohammed Meeraz at Shahjahanpur medical college told TOI, “Several patients are being sent to the hospital just because they were coughing or have returned from other districts. Since we cannot give any medical certificate, we are simply writing on their patient slip that their condition is normal.”

Similarly, administrative and health officials received several distress calls from villagers asking them to treat those who have returned from other states. A few villagers even dialled emergency ambulance service and police helpline 112 and asked them to take away people to the hospital for the treatment for coronavirus.

Sunandu Sudhakaran, SDM of Dhaurahra tehsil in Kheri district, told TOI, “We are receiving several calls from villages. People are asking us to conduct health check-up of people who have returned from cities.”

“People were advised to call the medical services if they find someone ill and displaying the symptoms of Covid-19. In case if someone is trying to create panic and disturb the social life of people who have returned from other states then appropriate action would be taken,” a police officer said.

Teams of health department along with administrative officials are visiting several villages every day and sharing the ways to fight against this disease.

As transport was being stopped, the checkposts would intensify checks and only permit vehicles to ply after proper screening. Fifteen checkposts had been established on the borders of Madurai district .

Maintaining social distancing was a must and more than five people cannot gather at any spot. The services that would be allowed during the curfew other than health are grocery shops, milk supply, vegetables, meat and fish stalls, ration shops and medicine shops.

COIMBATORE: In what could be a relief for people who were made to quarantine themselves under the sweltering heat, the city has been experiencing brief to moderate summer rain on and off since Saturday. Though the rain may not be enough to change water levels in tanks, it seems to have brought down temperature by 1C to 2C. Farmers too say the rain will help preparing soil for summer cultivation.

TNAU’s agro climate research centre recorded 8mm of rainfall on Monday and 37mm of rainfall on Saturday. This was the first summer showers in the district after the last drizzles that were recorded in January third week. While the centre did not record rainfall on Sunday, other parts of the district, like Peelamedu, Periyanaickenpalayam and Narasimanaickenpalayam, recorded 4mm to 10mm of rainfall. “This is convectional rain. If temperature keeps increasing and more clouds keep forming, it will result in more rainfall,” said director of the centre S P Ramanathan .

After rain, maximum temperatures at various places across the district fell by a couple of degrees. According to the regional meteorological centre, the district, which recorded average temperature of 36C on Thursday and 37.6C on Friday, saw average temperature fall to 35.4C on Monday and 36C on Tuesday.

The rain and relatively moderate afternoon temperature brought cheers among housewives and people working from home. “Rather than cooped in an airconditioned room, the rain made it tolerable to spend afternoon in balcony or play in the garden,” said Aparna Ram , a housewife in R S Puram.

Farmers also welcomed the beginning of the summer rain, as it will reduce the salinity of the soil and help getting better yield of their long terms crops like banana, sugarcane, turmeric, among others. “The summer rain gives crops the much needed moisture at the point when the leaves begin to dry up without irrigation. It will also help desalinate the soil making the crops grow well,” says district secretary of the Tamil Nadu Vivasaigal Sangam P Kandasamy. “It will also help summer cultivation of millets and pulses, which is done after mid-April. This moisture will help prepare the soil for it,” he added.

MADURAI: Madurai MP Su Venkatesan has asked the central government to give a three-month exemption to individuals, industries and traders from paying their Equated monthly loan instalments (EMI) dues.

According to a press statement, Venkatesan has written to the Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman , stating that all sections of the society including small scale industries , self-employed people, traders and unorganised workers have suffered huge losses due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

Even organised workers are incurring extra expenses due to the lock down being enforced. The prices of essential commodities have also risen.

In this unprecedented situation, people are not equipped to pay their EMI within the stipulated time.

Hence the MP said that a three-month relief from payment of EMIs should be granted. This would give some solace in the period of crisis.

Meanwhile, President of Madurai District Tiny & Small Scale Industries Association, B Muruganantham , welcomed the extension provided by the government for payment of GST and linking of Aadhaar and PAN card to June 30.

Penalty, interest and late fee waiver for companies with a turnover of Rs 5 crore should be enhanced to Rs 50 crore, he has said.

Boat owners from Thoppumpady, Kalamukku, Murukkinpadam and Chellanam have decided to stop fishing until further notice.The decision comes after the health and fisheries department’s advisory to harbour managers and boat owners to stop auction of fish to avoid crowding of people to ensure social distancing.Many of the fish peeling centres that provide the raw material to the seafood processing industry have closed down. “The seafood export industry is facing one of its worst dips in the recent past with seafood exports coming down to less than 40% of normal business due to lockdowns in many countries. With harbours closing down, seafood processing will be affected severely. Peeling centres run by private contractors have already shut,” said Seafood Exporters Association of India (SEAI) regional president Alex K Ninan.“Many fishing boats in Kochi do not have enough employees due to Covid-19 fear. Most employees are from other states and many of them have already returned to their home states. Moreover, the harbours and fishing centres are frequented by people from different parts and there is high chance of physical contact between them.

NEW DELHI: Strictly implemented social distancing measures such as home quarantine can reduce the overall expected number of cases by 62% and peak number of cases by 89%, thus “flattening” the curve and providing more opportunities for interventions, a mathematical modelling done by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) shows.The findings of the study also suggest that screening of travellers at entry points can delay introduction of the virus into the community by three days to three weeks. However, it concluded that as a public health measure, health system and community preparedness would be critical to control any impending spread of Covid-19 The study was conducted in February and the findings are based on the initial data and understanding of the spread of Covid-19. Such model projections are subject to substantial uncertainty but are often useful in indicating steps that may help reduce the impact or tackle the crisis, experts say. Dr R R Gangakhedkar, ICMR’s head of epidemiology, maintained that the modelling was done in February when the numbers were not very high and the focus was not to predict the number of cases that might occur but what methods would work towards control of the outbreak in India. “Lockdown and thermal screening works is what our study shows,” Gangakhedkar said.The calculation determined an epidemiological characteristic known as the reproduction number that determines how quickly an infection is spreading in a population. A value below 1 means the virus is on course to die out, while any number above 2 is difficult to contain without severe interventions.The study ‘Prudent public health intervention strategies to control the coronavirus disease-2019 transmission in India: A mathematical model-based approach’ shows that in the pessimistic scenario, when reproduction number is 4, and asymptomatic infections being half as infectious as symptomatic, the projected impact of social distancing falls to 2%.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74801665,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-203774,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/icmr-isolation-may-cut-peak-numbers-by-89/articleshow/74801667.cms

Nagpur: Following the directives of state government, most government departments barring those providing essential services are working with 5% staff in office. The heads of department and a few officers come to the office but there is no work and they go home after sometime.

Ulhas Debadwar, chief engineer of public works department (PWD), said only 5% staffers were working in his organization. “I have asked one staffer from each wing to attend office. This staffer has the passwords of computers of his colleagues. The other staffers are not relaxing but are available on WhatsApp. We are issuing necessary orders on WhatsApp and those working from home can print it and treat it as an office order. As such there is no work but we can’t relax because an emergency can arise any time and all of us must be prepared for that,” he told TOI.

A MahaMetro spokesperson said trains had stopped plying and all the staffers had been sent home. “However, construction activity is going on at a couple of places. We have the permission from district collector. We have sent another communication to him seeking further directions. If he asks us to stop construction fully we will do that. The construction workers have been provided masks and sanitizers,” he added.

Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC), which manages reservoirs, however has not reduced its field staff. “All the staffers are on duty at the dams because water supply is an essential service. However, at offices we have only 5% staff,” said chief engineer B Swami.

Resident deputy collector Ravindra Khajanchi, however, said that district collector office was functioning with 20 to 25% staff as the office was supervising the whole district. “We have asked the staffers to come to duty on rotational basis,” he said.

Banks come under essential services and they are working with 50% staff. An employee of State Bank of India (SBI), Congress Nagar branch, said that number of customers had reduced a lot. “After the curfew from today, the number of people coming to the bank was even less than Monday,” she said. An employee of SBI’s Jai Prakash Nagar branch said the same thing.

He was asked to contact Dr S M Bandekar , dean Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim.Naumov said some Russian tourists are facing difficulties as the lodges or hotels they stay at have started demanding doctor’s certificates or test reports that confirm that he or she is negative for Covid-19.“Goa is very hospitable, but few (tourists) do face problems,” he said. Several of them, including families, he said, have been unable to leave India due to the lockdown.

249,['25/03/2020'],"Anti-CAA protests ‘take a break’ in western UP, to resume after Covid-19 is defeated","Meerut/Agra/Bareilly: After Delhi and Lucknow, women protesters staging round-the-clock sit-in against CAA and NRC withdrew their stir in all cities of western UP, but with a rider that they will resume it once the novel coronavirus is wiped out. The “conditional break” was achieved after a lot of persuasion by police, authorities and religious leaders who termed large-scale gathering as unsafe amid the threat posed by novel coronavirus.

In Deoband, a town in UP’s Saharanpur district housing one of the world’s largest Islamic seminaries, a protest was going on for the last 57 days. On Tuesday, it was discontinued. However, the protesting women left their bangles and ‘burqas’ at the protest site, Eidgah ground, under the “guard of CCTV cameras”.

“We will resume the stir from April 5. Until then, no one will touch these burqas and bangles or else we would resume our agitation, then and there,” one of the protesters said. Over 500 women were at the sit-in site at any given time for the last almost two months in Deoband’s Eidgah, making it the largest protest site in UP.

According to Vidyasagar Mishra, Saharanpur superintendent of police (rural), “We had been talking to the representatives of this agitation for some time. On the day of janata curfew, the attendance became thin. And on late Monday night, they finally agreed with some conditions.”

Fozia Usmani, a member of Mutahida Khawatin Committee (MKC), the organising committee of the ‘dharna’, said, “We are leaving our bangles and burqas behind as our symbolic presence. We are only leaving the place for time being to mitigate chances of community spread of novel coronavirus.”

In Aligarh’s Shahjamal area, another major protest site in the state, the agitation was called off on Tuesday. The protesters were staging the sit-in for the last 55 days. They vacated the protest site after getting a “written” assurance from police that their tents and other items will not be removed from ‘dharna’ site, as they will resume the sit-in after spread of the virus is controlled.

City magistrate Vineet Kumar Singh, who was present at the site, said, “The protesters were told about the health issues and they agreed to vacate the site.” When asked about any kind of assurance given to the protesters, Singh refused to comment.

“Our priority is to check the spread of Covid-19,” the officer said.

“This is only temporary, and we will be back once the situation is under control,” said one of the protesters, adding that the protest against the government will continue till they accept their demand to withdraw Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

In Moradabad also, Eidgah was cleared of protesters. Additional superintendent of police (city) said that tents and other things have been removed from the sit-in site. Similarly, superintendent of police in Sambhal said that all protesting women have gone back to their homes calling off the protest there.

“Today, we reached among the protesters and interacted with them after which, except a few, everyone was ready to go back to their homes. Later, rest of them also vacated the spot and we cleared the ground after uprooting tents. An FIR was lodged against 12 named and 160 unknown people for their stubborn attitude,” ASP Amit Kumar Anand said. Earlier in the morning, the DM also gave the example of Shaheen Bagh of Delhi where anti-CAA protesters called off their protest on Tuesday morning.

COIMBATORE: In view of Covid-19 outbreak, at least 165 prisoners , five of them women, have been released on bail in the past two days to decongest the central jail in the city.

253,['25/03/2020'],Goa market sees brisk business without hiccups,"PANAJI: A strange anxiety was palpable in the Panaji municipal market for the first time in recent memory as shops opened for business early Tuesday in the backdrop of the lockdown . There was no commotion, as shopkeepers and buyers went about in near grim silence.Vendors entered the market at 5am and by 5.30am buyers started lining up outside. Of the 400-odd stalls and stores in the municipal market complex, only 40% opened. Outside, only food and grocery stores were operational.“Most of the grocery items are overpriced and in limited quantity. We have to eat to survive so we have no other option, but to purchase food at the price being quoted,” shopper Afzal Bawanwar said.Aware of the gravity of the situation, many shoppers were seen moving around with either masks or handkerchiefs on their face. Purchasing was carried out smoothly without any law and order situation.“There were no fights or stampede. We had made announcements and the government carried out necessary awareness. People are also well informed about the situation,” PSI Manjunath Naik told TOI.Some police constables stood outside the building, while some stood on the first floor along with CCP mayor Uday Madkaikar and monitored the situation .“Those who were rushing, gathering into a group to purchase from the same vendor or on the verge of touching each other were told to maintain adequate distance. Our main objective is to avoid people touching each other,” Naik said.While some buyers engaged in panic buying, others shopped limited quantities of items with a long shelf life, like pulses and rice. The fish and meat markets were emptied even before the 11am deadline. Shoppers, who came in post 10am, were left high and dry. “If there is nothing available, what will people come out and buy. They must ensure that people don’t go hungry,” a shopper said.At about 10.45am, a siren went off indicating that it was time for shoppers to disperse. Vendors hurriedly shut shop in the next fifteen minutes while police gathered at the gates to seal them.Rohit Naik, a resident of Tonca said, “The government should’ve been very clear about markets being closed. Many people adhered to the PM’s appeal to avoid panic buying and as a result we did not stock up.

254,['25/03/2020'],"Locked down, Delhi anxious for necessities","NEW DELHI: When announcing the national lockdown, Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured the people that essential services , including supply of food and milk, would operate normally. The ground reality was otherwise on Wednesday with complaints from across Delhi about local police preventing deliveries, disrupting goods movement and closing down shops. There were reports of short supply of paneer, milk, curd, flour, noodles and processed food items with long shelf life.While Deepanshu Agarwal of Sadar Bazar said the milk outlet on Delhi Cantt Road had started rationing due to limited supplies, Nikhil Rishi of Dwarka narrated how he had been asked to come for milk at 6.30 in the morning, but had found the queue “frustratingly long”.One of the reasons for this artificial shortage, according to Jasola resident Safura Ubaid, is because of interference by the cops. “Policemen are beating the delivery guys and not allowing people buy grocery, milk or medicines,” she alleged. Samarpal, a vendor in Laxmi Nagar, accused the cops, both of Delhi and UP, of asking for bribes to be allowed to sell vegetables.The owner of Kajal General Store in south Delhi’s Old JNU campus glumly said that he hasn’t been able to refill depleted stocks. “Forget about delivering supplies, the wholesale agents are not even releasing stocks even when you pay for them in advance. There is not one pack of flour in this whole area,” he said.SB Tripathi, a Supreme Court lawyer, grumbled, “Shopkeepers in Dwarka are selling vegetables at elevated price. Ladyfinger, earlier costing Rs 80/kg, is now selling for Rs 120.” Gaurav Singh, a resident of Shankar Vihar, added darkly, “People are hoarding and this is not how it should be.”Many have managed to buy essentials to last a few days, but are worried about the future. “Though we have adequate groceries at home, I thought of stocking up on meat and fish for the week,” revealed Sheikh Sarai resident Jayanta Ghosh. “But when I called the meat shop, the owner said supply had stopped and he wasn't sure when he could reopen his shop.”It’s not just grocers and vegetable sellers who are affected. Sandeep Nangia, who heads the Delhi Chemists’ Association, said members had complained of police beating them for being on the streets. He requested senior officers to instruct the policemen on the roads to check identity cards before taking action.Perhaps because of hassles of this sort, some medicine stores remained closed on Wednesday. Amrita Chugh in Karol Bagh said, “Uneasy about what would happen in the next few day, I decided to buy some medicines. But the shop nearby was closed. If it continues to stay shut, how will we make it through the lockdown period?”Deliveries of online orders of essential goods and food items have also been hit. Siddhant Wangdi, who runs an online meat business, stopped deliveries across the National Capital Region because of lack of clarity in the lockdown guidelines. “Ground staff have been sent home from the roads and delivery executives have also been hit,” he disclosed. Big Basket released a statement saying it was “not operational due to restrictions imposed by local authorities on movement of goods in spite of clear guidelines provided by central authorities to enable essential services”.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74821263,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-42723,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/locked-down-city-anxious-for-necessities/articleshow/74819166.cms

KOCHI: Even though people prefer to stay at home over the past few weeks due to the spread of Covid-19, the sale of liquor and beer in Ernakulam has not seen much of a decline.

Figures show that the Kerala State Beverages Corporation (KSBC) outlets and bars that take the supply from the three KSBC warehouses in the district — Tripunithura, Aluva and Vengola — have together sold 13.67 lakh litres of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) and 10.62 lakh litres of beer during March 1-22 compared to 20.55 lakh litres of IMFL and 13.86 lakh litres of beer during February 1-29. As per the data, there is an average daily sale of 7,086 litres of IMFL and 4,779 litres of beer in February compared to the daily sale average of 6,213 litres of IMFL and 4,827 litres of beer in March.

This means there was only a decline of daily sale of around 800 litres of IMFL and an increase of around 50 litres of beer in March compared to that in February.

According to KSBC officials, with the new restrictions regarding queuing in front of outlets, closure of bars and the fear of possible shutdown of KSBC outlets in the coming days, people have started panic-buying of liquor and beer too, hence could easily overtake the overall sales of February by the end of March.

“Almost all outlets in the district witnessed steady sale even after the government brought in restriction in queuing. People are coming to outlets twice or thrice daily to buy bottles in bulk quantities. With seven more days to go in March, it will easily break the sales in February when there were no restrictions,” said a KSBC official.

Excise officials said that with the closure of bars, the sale of bottles in Bevco outlets will see a soaring high in the coming days. “Though government has asked people to stay at home, many are going out to buy liquor. Even police won’t stop them when they say they are going to the KSBC outlets,” said a senior excise official.

Meanwhile, officers said that many toddy shops have decided to stop operations. “Though toddy shops have not been asked to shut, many of the owners are closing them on their own,” said an officer.

BENGALURU: Rumi Basu, 63, visited a bank on Tuesday morning only to be turned back. The staff advised her to use online banking as they have been instructed to minimise face-to-face interaction. “But I don’t know how to go about it. People of my generation are not tech-savvy,” said a clueless Rumi.

In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, senior citizens like Rumi are facing several concerns. Many who live alone are unable to keep up with the mad rush for groceries that the city witnessed on Tuesday and Wednesday.

“Several shops were closed. Those that were open were too crowded. Some of them like Hopcoms functioned during irregular hours depending on the arrival of fruits and vegetables. It became extremely difficult for senior citizens to get even basic necessities. Many pharmacies ran out of medicines . Many elderly persons can’t make rounds of shops, shoving crowds or walking long distances,” said Santhosh Abraham, who runs a social enterprise called ElderAid Wellness. Santosh said there’s a spike in calls seeking help from his organisation.

Senior citizens are among the worst affected, said Mahita Nagaraj, a digital marketing professional who is a caremonger now. “We have received calls from elderly patients who need to undergo dialysis saying they have been unable to arrange transport to hospital. There are others whose home nurses did not turn up,” said Mahiya.

“My domestic help has not been coming for two days now. It’s not easy for a healthy adult to run a home without the maid. So you can imagine my situation,” said 66-year-old Nalini V, who stays with her 70-year-old husband in Nandini Layout.

Susheela Venkat, who lives in an apartment complex on Cambridge Road, said the children of several senior citizens stay in different parts of the country and the world. “They are concerned not just about themselves but about their children as well. We are keeping a regular check on them. We have a group of youngsters running errands for them,” she said.

“Many senior citizens, including several of my friends, are worried about contracting the disease. We fear if there is acute shortage of medical facilities, we may not be top priority for doctors and will be left to our destiny,” added Rumi.

Even their routines have taken a hit. “It’s difficult to pass time now. We used to go for a morning walk every day, sit on the benches in the neighbourhood park, have coffee with friends at the local darshini and again get together for a chat in the evening. Now, parks are closed and so are darshinis,” said Siddappa Shankar, a retired medical officer.

However, members of the opposition and treasury benches urged the government to curtail it in the wake of the lockdown enforced in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19.

The house passed the appropriation bill and approved demand for grants in the absence of the opposition after Yediyurappa replied to the debate.“It is undemocratic on the part of the ruling party, which chose to pass the budget when the entire opposition stayed away.

As many as 35 ,000 people from Surat and Mumbai, those mostly engaged in the diamond industry, started to pour into Amreli in the past one week after businesses and industry started shutting down.

Talking to TOI, Amreli district collector Ayush Oak said, “Nearly 35,000 people returned to Amreli district in the past one week. We have created checkposts and screened everybody before they entered into the district.”

According to the district administration, 99 people had a travel history of foreign countries, while 38 had flu-like symptoms and have been ordered home quarantine for two weeks.

Kamal Patel, a diamond worker, who returned to Abhrampara of Savarkundla taluka on March 21 said, “We were jobless as the industry has shutdown in Surat. We are also scared of contracting Coronavirus. So we decided to come back to native for a few days.”

According to sources, with every taluka of Amreli district seeing people rush in, in private vehicles, there is a heavy traffic jam on the roads connected to Amreli.

A private bus operator who runs between Surat and Amreli said, “There was a heavy rush of people coming to Amreli last week. But even buses have stopped now.”

Bhupendrasinh Jadeja, sarpanch of Dhulia Domla village of Lodhika taluka in Rajkot district said that he hasn’t seen so many people during Diwali festival coming to their native. “I feel that it’s the rebirth of villages,” Jadeja added.

However, after the lockdown, all the districts have sealed their borders, even for private vehicles. This has actually made the scene pathetic for many unprivileged people, who had no option but to walk long distances as their employers shut shop asking them to leave at once.

We have been experiencing lockdowns and a strict quarantine for 15 days in Gurugram (in February) when we returned from China. In a way, we have lived in isolation in the past two months and it is likely to continue for another 21 days. This is the time to maintain restraint and keep clam.

If China has controlled the virus, it is because of the public and government cooperation. People were not disturbed even though they were given the option of coming out of the house once in a week and one person in a family was allowed. The apartment main doors would be closed. We were confined to our rooms with no outside connection. Doctors used to monitor temperature twice in a week.

The isolation, in fact, brought many of us together. We were working from our rooms but built close bonding with many people. My roommate got into a depression, worried over the developments. All of us got together and consoled him. Now, we have become good friends.

The isolation definitely is a bitter pill but offers better cure. After attending to our office duty, we would chalk out a plan. We dowloaded many e-books and tried to gain knowledge on coronavirus.

Sawant said that “although there is no positive case of Covid-19 yet, it doesn’t mean there are no coronavirus patients in the state”.“A 100% lockdown and 100% curfew is being ordered under the Epidemic Diseases Act,” Sawant said, adding that he expects the public to cooperate.“We can live without milk and food for some time, but we have to be united to fight coronavirus,” Sawant said. “Coronavirus is in Goa, but till date, it has not been reported...Only if we observe this lockdown till March 31 can we remain safe.” He also said that community transfer of coronavirus hasn’t taken place in Goa.The latest government decision was taken during an all-party meet.Sawant said that the government is concerned about the supply of essential commodities, and that within the next three days, arrangements would be made to supply the same to people in need. “The collector will put in place a system through which essential commodities like rice, dal and oil can reach people in need,” he said. He also said that ATMs of nationalised banks would be allowed to function, and that “if possible”, Goa Dairy’s milk centre would offer home delivery of milk.Speaking to reporters, Sawant said that no shops would be open from Wednesday onwards, and that only emergency services of the government would be operational. He also said that pharmacies would be kept open.“I know that people will be inconvenienced and face difficulties, but we have to bear it in the interest of our health,” Sawant said. He also said that people do not understand the severity of Covid-19 “When the market opened today (Tuesday), people did not maintain distance from one another,” he said.The CM also said that outpatient departments (OPDs) will be closed in primary health centres and other centres, but casualty facilities would be kept open. “I urge people not to visit hospitals to check their blood pressure and fever,” he said. “Only in emergency cases people should visit the hospital.”Sawant also said that police will act against those who do not adhere to curfew restrictions. “Police will stop people at various points,” he said. A high-level committee has been formed under the CM’s chairmanship, and the cabinet has given it all powers to take any decision with respect to Covid-19.Meanwhile, the government has received over 1,000 messages on the WhatsApp number it circulated so that the public could inform it about Covid-19 suspects in their locality, and over 500 people have already been home-quarantined. “I urge the people not to come out of their houses and stop the spread of community transmission,” Sawant said.The state government has already closed its border. However, the CM said that anyone who has entered the state, even if healthy, can spread Covid-19. “Those who travelled to Goa during the past eight days should home quarantine themselves,” he said. “They should visit Goa Medical College to check if they have any coronavirus symptoms. If they don’t quarantine themselves, we will force them to.”Sawant also urged people to inform the government about people who recently entered Goa. “One person can transmit Covid-19 to three persons,” he said.Meanwhile, the government has said that the state had three suspected Covid-19 patients, who were serious, but have recovered. “Doctors feel that they can’t be Covid-19 patients,” he said. People should not fall prey to rumours concerning coronavirus, Sawant said. “If we maintain community distance, only then can we stop the transmission of the disease.”",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74804825,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-365870,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-assures-supply-of-essential-items-to-those-in-need/articleshow/74801282.cms

BIJNOR: In the wake of the coronavirus scare, UP government has given the nod to relax lockdown norms for sugar mills, distilleries and cane farmers .

Accepting some demands of the Uttar Pradesh Sugar Mills Association, UP government has permitted them to procure raw material like sulphur and lime from Rajasthan to process cane into sugar and deliver the products derived from cane to markets.

According to sources, most of the 119 mills in the state had virtually run out of raw material to process 2.5 crore tonnes of yet-to-be harvested standing cane crop. In this context, the sugar association had written to the government, demanding that cane harvesting should continue and labourers be allowed into the fields and sugar mills.

The association pointed out that due to the lockdown, sale of petrol had fallen and so would the sale ethanol. So it sought an increase in the amount of ethanol mixed in petrol from the present 10%. Besides, it would help in preventing accumulation of stocks. In case, the stock is not lifted, the mills would have to shut down their ethanol plants. However, government is yet to take a stand on this matter.

Reacting to government’s move, Bijnor district magistrate Ramakant Pandey said mills had been allowed to transport their product and purchase cane at assigned centres and sugar mill gates. Apart from this, labourers would be allowed to harvest the cane and farmers to bring their produce to purchase centres and mill gates.

At the same time, the administration has asked the farmers and labourers to take necessary precautions against the virus while working and transporting cane, raw material, etc.

According to officials, there are 119 sugar mills here in the state which crush around 70 lakh quintal cane per day. Around 46 lakh farmers supply their produce to these units.

Around 4 lakh construction workers are registered with Construction Workers Welfare Board (CWWB) of the Delhi government. All of them will be provided the financial assistance from CWWB Fund.According to sources, the government is also considering developing a mechanism for identification and fund disbursal for those construction workers who are not registered with the Board and other daily wagers who have lost their livelihood due to the unprecedented lockdown. The government is also increasing the number of night shelters so that those who have no source of earning now can get food. It will also distribute food at different places for people affected by the lockdown.In a digital press conference, Kejriwal said that no new case of coronavirus had been reported in the last 40 hours in Delhi. But, leaving nothing to chance, the Delhi government has constituted a team of five doctors which will review the city’s preparedness for handling the situation if we reach the third stage of community transmission. The committee will submit a report within 24 hours to the chief minister on the steps required to deal with this and suggest ways to strengthen the system. “We have started preparations to build a foolproof health system to combat the situation if we ever get into stage three of this pandemic. We have to be fully prepared in terms of medical support,"" Kejriwal said.""In the last 40 hours, there has not been a single new coronavirus positive case in Delhi. Earlier, we had 30 such positive cases, and among them, many people are getting better and going home. Till now five people have survived and gone home. Currently, we have only 23 positive cases in Delhi,” Kejriwal said, asking people to observe the lockdown strictly since otherwise cases may increase.Kejriwal urged people not to discriminate against those who work in airlines, hospitals and other coronavirus sensitive jobs. “I have received complaints that somewhere in Delhi people did not allow a pilot to enter the colony because they thought he could be affected by coronavirus and the same has happened in some other cases. This is something absolutely unacceptable....doctors, nurses, pilots and air hostesses are our responsibility... These are the people who are working relentlessly to give you proper medical help and support and they should be welcomed,” he said.In response to another call by the chief minister, many landlords have announced waiving of rent for tenants for now.

265,['25/03/2020'],Hyderabad: Drug production units face trouble despite govt order,"Representative image

HYDERABAD: Bulk manufactures of drugs in Hyderabad and surrounding areas have been facing trouble due to police action since the lockdown announcement by the state government. Buses transporting employees, vehicles supplying raw material for drugs are being stopped or seized at various police stations.

The Bulk Drug Manufacturers Association had written to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao but despite principal secretary Jayesh Ranjan’s clarification, bulk drug units continued to face similar issues.

“The government had issued GO-45 wherein the pharma industry had been exempted from the lockdown keeping in view the essential service of making enough stocks of critical drugs and pharma products available. However, most employees and busses of drug companies are being stopped by local police officials. Some are also not accepting the clarification addressed to district collectors by the principal secretary,” executive director of Bulk Drug Manufacturers Association, P Eshwar Reddy told TOI.

“Bulk drug and pharma unit operations are continuous and work round-the-clock. An inspector from Dundigal is not allowing pharma employees despite them showing the principal secretary’s letter and other relevant documents. Cops at Dundigal also seized medical supply vehicles,” Eshwar Reddy said.

Meanwhile, police claimed that they only seized pharma company buses that were violating social distancing norms. “On the first day (of lockdown), around 20 buses of pharma companies were stopped, counselled and later released. They were violating social distancing norms during transportation and there were no sanitisers or masks in the buses. They were told to give it in writing that they would not violate the norms again,” an inspector from Dundigal said. “Today (Tuesday) we seized 18 buses carrying employees without following proper measures. We also booked cases. Out of 400 buses we checked, 18 are seized. We did not seize any trucks supplying raw material,” the inspector added.

BDMA national president VV Krishna Reddy has written letters to chief ministers of Telangana and AP in this regard. “Over 35% of bulk drugs and pharmaceutical production in India takes place in Hyderabad, Rangareddy, Medchal, Sangareddy and Kothagudem and three districts — Prakasham, Krishna and Vishakapatnam — in Andhra Pradesh. We are already under pressure to operate units at full capacity to mitigate the issue of shortage of essential drugs. As most operations in bulk drug processing are continuous, it would be difficult to abruptly stop the reactions which could lead to unsafe operation,” Krishna Reddy said.

“All our member units have introduced thorough checking of all employees, casual workers and indirect workers...There is a need to implement the exemption to the bulk drug industry,” the BDMA president added.

HYDERABAD: Several villages in the state have ensured that locals abide by lockdown guidlines and have stopped the entry of outsiders. Only those attending to emergency work are being permitted to go out.

In many districts, villages have temporarily sealed their borders by erecting wooden barricades, tree branches and stones on the roads. Some villages have even passed resolutions to impose a fine Rs 1,000 on violators.

Hipnelli village in Nirmal district, which is located on the Maharashtra border, decided to seal their village borders by erecting fences. Similarly, Jukkal villge on the border of Karantaka has also banned the entry of outsiders from the neighbouring state. In Khammam district, several villages have dug up trenches and placed thorny bushes to prevent entry of outsiders.

“We are allowing only daily needs such as milk and vegetables into their villages. We feel it is the responsibility of every villager to implement the lockdown and cooperate with the government,” said Rachannagudem sarpanch, K Ganapathi.

In some villages like Ibrahimpatnam, Polkampally and Yeliminedu, the panchayat has posted a guard to see no vehicle or person from outside enters the village. Similar steps were taken in Koyagudem in Tekulapalle mandal of Kothagudem district and Marlakunta village in Khammam. Since Nalgonda, Rangareddy, Kamareddy, Nizamabad and Mahbubnagar districts are close to Hyderabad, many villages are not even allowing their locals who are residing in Hyderabad to come back.

Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, during his press conference on Tuesday lauded the people who have been voluntarily implementing lockdown and maintaining social distance. The CM said that in Hyderabad, Rachakonda and Cyberabad, the situation was improving.

However, the SI came from behind and hit the journalist without even asking him who he was,” said a member of the Telangana Union of Working Journalists (TUWJ).

In another incident, the bureau chief of an English daily was manhandled by Begumpet police. The incident was brought to the notice of senior police officials including the DGP.

“The DGP said what happened was very unfortunate and apologised. He also spoke to the senior officer of the city police and directed him to initiate corrective measures,” TUWJ general secretary Virahat Ali said.

HYDERABAD: With many airline operators cancelling services at the last minute, several passengers were stranded at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport on Tuesday, the last day before domestic airspace is locked down. While some passengers were accommodated on alternate flights, many were rerouted to different destinations close to their original destination. A lack of cabs and public transport meant many even had to cancel their tickets on Tuesday.

“My parents, both senior citizens, were travelling from Dehradun to Coimbatore via Hyderabad, but their connection to Coimbatore was cancelled. They were stuck at RGIA for hours. Later, the carrier booked them on a flight to Chennai,” said Nikunj Rathi. “We have to manage to get them from there,” he added.

Similarly, a group of 60 passengers from Rajahmundry and Hyderabad, were told that their flight to Thiruvananthapuram was cancelled. “We were informed about it only after we checked into the airport. We felt helpless because we knew that all services would be suspended post-midnight. Fortunately, by late afternoon our flight was restored and it departed at 3.40 pm,” said Neetu Roy.

A last-minute cancellation of a Hyderabad-Mangalore service left four young doctors stuck at RGIA. “I am a worried father. My daughter left for Mangalore via Hyderabad at 7:30 in the morning and is still at Hyderabad. Please help four such doctors stuck at Hyderabad,” tweeted one of the doctors’ father.

Many were forced to cancel their flights owing to unavailability of cabs and Pushpak services. “My relative was supposed to travel to Chennai for a family emergency. In fact, he was initially booked for March 25, but we advanced his ticket after hearing about the lockdown. But we just could not get a cab, either from an aggregator or a private rental agency, to ferry him to the airport. We do not have a private vehicle,” said Jayaganesh.

Also caught in a helpless situation was CK Mishra, who was scheduled to travel to Ranchi by a 5.45 am flight. “I tried to book a cab from 4 pm on Monday (since the lockdown was to start at 7 pm). I even reached out to the police, but they could not help. I went around looking for help till midnight and then gave up. Later, I saw an email from the airline that the flight was cancelled,” she told TOI.

273,['25/03/2020'],Lavelle Road residents pool in money for daily-wage earners on their street,"TimesView It is during moments of extreme crisis that the gnawing gap between the haves and the have-nots becomes obvious. And it’s also at such trying times that little acts of sharing and caring can make a world of difference to the less fortunate. In their gracious gesture, the Lavelle Road residents have shown how empathy should be cultivated not just in words but in deeds too. With the country going under a prolonged lockdown and supplies fast drying up, living with a little less of everything but a little more of concern for others could help all of us stay afloat.

Free boxes for strays

BENGALURU: As days get tougher with the lockdown, small acts of kindness are warming hearts. In a touching gesture, around 100 residents of Lavelle Road came together to donate money to daily-wage earners on their street.Under the Living Lavelle Group, eight familiar faces in the locality, including the flower seller in front of the temple, the vegetable vendor, the laundry man and the chaiwala are being given Rs 6,000 and a mask each. Every resident of the locality has donated Rs 500-Rs 1,000.“When the lockdown began, we realised that the group which would be hit the most would be daily-wage earners. They have disappeared from the roads. The chaiwala who used to sell hundreds of cups to the neighbourhood offices is literally selling one or two to the security persons at the gate. We had to do something to help them. The least was to give them money so that they could at least have two meals a day for a month,” said Moumi Moola, an entrepreneur, who initiated the idea.And the daily-wage earners said they couldn’t be more thankful. Arun Kumar , 35, who has been ironing clothes on Lavelle Road for the last 10 years and earning a minimum of Rs 500 per day, has been struggling to earn Rs 100 a day for the past one week.“I have been at home for almost a week now. Even before the lockdown began, people stopped giving me clothes to iron. My earnings dropped to Rs 100 or less. I got calls from my regular customers, but when I stepped out of home to get to work, cops asked me to return. I will collect the money from the association on Wednesday,” he said.With the temple in the area shut, Sharada, a flower seller, is left without a job. The single mother of two said she was extremely worried about their livelihood and the donation is a major relief. Sharada and the vegetable vendor got the money on Tuesday.Meanwhile, Heads Up For Tails, a pet store outlet on Magrath Road gave away free food boxes for stray dogs on Monday. Some of these boxes were delivered to customers when they ordered food for their pets. “The worst affected will be stray dogs in commercial areas. With restaurants and offices closing, they will be out of food. These boxes can be kept around road corners where the dogs can find them. Around 30 boxes were delivered on Monday,” said Ritima Coelho , co-founder of the pet store chain.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74803388,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1484344,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/lavelle-road-residents-pool-in-money-for-daily-wage-earners-on-their-street/articleshow/74800129.cms

AHMEDABAD: With six more positive cases of coronavirus registered in the state on Tuesday, the total number of persons who have tested positive for Covid-19 has reached 36. One person from Surat and Vadodara and two each from Gandhinagar and Rajkot tested positive on Tuesday.

One person has died so far in the state because of the pandemic. Even as a 21-day lockdown across the country has been announced, the state government assured people that supply and availability of essential commodities will remain uninterrupted.

FIR have been filed against four patients in Gandhinagar for violating quarantine norms. A couple who returned from Dubai, along with their relatives, have been booked by Gandhinagar police on Tuesday.

Local transmission now is close to one-third of all registered cases in Gujarat. By Tuesday evening, over 30 lakh persons have been surveyed across the state, according state government officials.

The Rajya Sabha election for four seats of Gujarat, scheduled to be held on March 26, has been postponed indefinitely by the Election Commission of India on Tuesday. New dates for the election will be announced at later, state chief electoral officer S Murali Krishna said.

Cops were seen enforcing the lockdown in all other major cities of Gujarat, even as the state government urged people not to venture out of their homes, except in cases of emergency.

KOLLAM: Even as reports about Karnataka government blocking patients from Kasaragod avail healthcare in the state had hit the headlines, a Malayali doctor has been left stranded at the border after Kerala authorities refused entry to her.

Over the past two days, the 23-year-old doctor from Kunnamangalam in Kozhikode who has been doing her internship after passing out from Subaiah Institute of Medical Sciences in Shivamogga, has contacted the Kerala chief minister, health minister, Wayanad district collector and SP to allow her entry to her home state but to no avail.

She was on her way to present herself to serve at Government Beach Hospital in Kozhikode as an intern but was blocked by Kerala police officers when she reached the checkpost at the border town of Kutta.

When she spoke to Wayanad collector and SP they explained that they need a government order to allow her in. She got in touch with health minister KK Shailaja’s office and told them that she was alone and stranded on the street and that the ministers’ office should intervene. She was told to contact the chief minister’s war room.

However, despite repeated efforts, she was not able to contact the war room. Subsequently, as advised by her parents, she requested the Karnataka police’s help to arrange her a conveyance to a friends’ house at Mysore.

Though the friend’s family allowed her to stay with them for two days they too expressed reluctance in allowing her to stay there for long in view of Corona scare.

She said on Tuesday too her efforts to get in touch with the chief minister’s office or the health minister’s office did not bear fruit.

As she has already vacated the college hostel at Shivamogga, she cannot return to there as well.

“I expected that the authorities would allow me to cross the border as I am a young woman and travelling alone. They could have quarantined me. I had sent all relevant papers to the health minister’s office and to the CM’s war room. How can they leave a girl alone on the road,” she asks.

Wayanad district collector Dr Adila Abdulla said she has been given strict orders not to allow anyone across the borders. “There is nothing I can do,” she said in a WhatsApp message.

When the issue was brought to the attention of the health minister’s office, an official said it was up to the authorities at CM’s war room to handle ‘interstate issues’.

Since the applicant is a doctor, the Kozhikode DMO could take a decision to help her, said an official at the war room.

“If the Kozhikode DMO writes to the government stating that she could be deployed as an intern, then the Wayanad collector could allow her across the border,” an official requesting anonymity said.

Besides, small companies were sought to be protected from insolvency action by raising the threshold under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code to a loan of Rs 1 crore, instead of the current Rs 1 lakh floor.The minister also said IBC provisions may be waived in case the coronavirus crisis persisted till beyond April. The announcements, which are a precursor to the much-anticipated economic package to aid industry and individuals facing income uncertainty, offer concessions of filings for a limited period and are not permanent.Sitharaman — who assured 24x7 customs facilities for exporters and importers — made it clear that the idea was to ensure that people stayed in lockdown and took care of their families instead of exposing themselves to the deadly virus by venturing out to be ""honest taxpayers"". As a result, the GST filing deadline for three months, starting February, has been deferred until June 30. Besides, companies with an annual turnover of up to Rs 5 crore do not have to worry about paying any late fee or interest.In case of the larger entities, the penal interest has been halved to 9%. On the income tax front, the last date for filing returns for the financial year 2018-19 has been extended from March 31, 2020 to June 30, 2020, which is also the new deadline for linking Aadhaar with PAN. But it will benefit only a small section of the population as the bulk of the returns have already been filed.There was a bigger gain for those looking to settle their direct tax disputes via the Vivad Se Vishwas scheme. Instead of the the March 31 deadline, no additional 10% amount will be levied if the payment is made by the end of June 30, the FM said. On the indirect tax side too, the payment deadline under the Sabka Vishwas scheme has been extended until the end of June and no interest will be levied. The move was welcomed by the industry, which had been pitching for the concessions as they were finding it tough to comply with the norms due to a majority of employees working from home.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74801676,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-182861,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/fm-nirmala-sitharaman-eases-rules-for-bank-customers-taxpayers-firms/articleshow/74801677.cms

Many of them even wanted the schools to be closed when the first Covid-19 case was reported.Children, though the least affected group in China, are found to be the fastest transmitters of novel coronavirus and can have a devastating impact on the elderly in the family, who belong to the most susceptible group. Many experts have called children “super spreaders” as it is difficult to implement the social-distancing approach in their cases.To understand the public opinion, LocalCircles conducted the survey among parents and received 10,860 responses from 207 cities/towns. While 81% of the respondents were in favour of keeping the schools closed till May, 9% voted against it while 10% were unsure.The majority of the parents feel keeping the schools closed would largely minimise the risk of the virus spread. With the next session starting on June 1, there will be negligible loss of working days for the academic year, they claimed. The spring session starts in the first week of April in many parts of the country.LocalCircles will submit the findings to various stakeholders at the central government and the chief secretaries of all states.The statistics from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control & Prevention show 2,000 confirmed or suspected cases of the novel coronavirus infection among children. In the national capital region, the first school-related case was reported when a man, whose sons are students of a school in Noida, was found to be positive on March 2.

One reason for return of trains was lack of space at the end stations where these trains had reached before withdrawal of operations . “This was done for rake balancing,” says ACM (Goods) SG Rao.With suspension of train operations, mechanical department’s role now is crucial in maintaining trains that have been held up in the yard. Railway Board on Tuesday issued an advisory asking to avoid congregation of people and regulate working of coaching depots.Senior divisional mechanical engineer (SrDME) Akhilesh Choubey said, “Timings of most of the trains originating from Nagpur are in the evening. Hence, these can be maintained in morning the same day after orders to restart operations are issued. As of now all these trains have been locked and stationed in the yard.”“We are focusing on freight train maintenance now for which teams have been segregated for social distancing. In office also not more than 5% staff is working. Contractual staff has been sent home after sanitizing entire station, waiting halls and rooms etc,” he added.Officials said Indian Railways is working 24X7 to ensure uninterrupted supply of essential commodities across the nation. Commodities like foodgrains, salt, sugar, milk, edible oil, onions, fruits and vegetables, petroleum products, coal etc are being loaded at railway terminals.Nagpur being a coal loading division, no essential commodities are being loaded here.Due to coronavirus outbreak, passenger train operations across the country have been suspended till March 31, 2020.

Medical waste should be disposed of in the dry waste segment by households only on Wednesdays.Dnyaneshwar Molak, head of the Pune Municipal Corporation’s solid waste management department, said, “We have about 57 solid waste management plants in the city. Many workers engaged in these units hail from the villages. The Covid-19 scare has sent 25% of them home. Hence, there is a load on the system. But, we are managing with the remaining staff. In this time, we request citizens to be more responsible and dispose of waste as per the give schedule,” Molak said.Suman More, a SWaCH worker said they have some complaints from wastepickers about some societies not providing them water to wash their hands.“The PMC is providing masks, soaps and gloves in phases. But to wash hands, we need water. While a majority of the societies are nice to wastepickers, some have told the wastepickers not to use the water facilities. This hampers their work and can harm their health. They go to work at 6am or 7am and come home after 1pm or 2pm. So when there is no water, they can’t wash their hands, and hence cannot eat food. They can do so only after taking a bath after returning home, which is not good for their health,” More said.“Procuring soap, masks and gloves has become difficult due to the unavailability of many hygiene products. But we have placed the orders as we anticipate that the need will remain for some time now,” Molak said.Societies that have engaged individuals to clear garbage are in a spot.Many have no system to dispose of wet waste on their premises.Even those that have the facility said their housekeeping staf are not coming to collect the garbage as they are scared to leave theri homes in this period of lockdown.Some have engaged people from outside the state.

282,['25/03/2020'],"Societies tell maids to stay at home for one month, with no salary cut","PUNE: A paranoia about the coronavirus has prompted many housing societies to keep the maids out and view foreign-returned residents with suspicion.

Maids working in societies that have reported Covid-19 positive patients are being asked by many households not to report for a month. Residents are also wary of those who have returned from abroad.

Speaking to TOI, a resident said, “Our maid used to work in a society where a person tested Covid-19 positive. She did not turn up for work on the day the person tested positive, but we were not aware of it. It was when a video of the building started circulating on WhatsApp group that my wife spotted her coming out of it.”

“The maid remained at home for some days. We called her and asked her not to report for work for a month. Though we have decided to pay her full salary for a month, she said that she has lost a couple of jobs and not everyone want to pay her. In fact, she and her friend, who also works in the same society, are being discriminated against in their own community,” said the resident.

Many housing societies have in fact circulated messages in their society groups asking residents not to allow anyone inside their home. Even delivery boys are not allowed inside the society and residents asked to collect the parcels from the main gate.

With the news of a cab driver getting infected while ferrying a passenger from abroad, people are even reluctant to travel in auto rickshaws and cabs, thus affecting the livelihood of drivers, said activists.

Meanwhile, psychologists said that the moment an individual feels he or she is at risk, he/she stops behaving like a social animal and succumbs to an inherent behaviour of self-preservation. Psychologists also feel that the city might record an increase in cases of post-traumatic stress disorders, especially among health workers and those who were quarantined.

Anuradha Patil, senior professor, Karve Institute of Social Service, who has worked extensively with HIV positive people, said that more than racial discrimination it is fear of the unknown disease which causes discriminatory behaviour among people.

“We are on a vacation in a place where no incident of Covid-19 has been reported, yet we were looked at suspiciously. This behaviour is evident every time the society faces something unknown,” said Patil.

Psychologist Kinjal Goyal felt that the ongoing scare has brought us face to face with a basic human instinct for self-preservation. “It is this instinct of protecting oneself from harm that makes people turn against their neighbours. Checking on those quarantined at home over the phone is a basic step that can alleviate their feeling of loneliness and dread.”

However, she also stressed on the need for bringing back those who have faced quarantine into normal life. “Healthcare professionals, people who have tested positive and are recovering, those who have been isolated due to recent travel to foreign countries affected by the virus all are at risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorders. Providing counselling to all such individuals will help in minimising the coronavirus scare,” added Goyal.

PITHORAGARH: A joint team of police and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) destroyed the iron ropes on Kali river between Pangla and Tawaghat villages of Dharchula Tehsil on Tuesday. These ropes were used to cross the river and enter India illegally. The action has been taken to check illegal movement of people between India and Nepal amidst Covid-19 pandemic.

SP Pithoragarh Priti Priyadarshni told TOI that these iron ropes were destroyed at seven places — Ghasku Ghat, Barati Ghat, Malkatia Ghat , Dokat Ghat, Tintola Ghat, Jingati Ghat, and Tawaghat.

Notably, Kali river demarcates border between India and Nepal. In areas like Dharchula, Baluakot, Jauljabi, Dyada and Jhulaghat, there are suspension bridges which make legal entry points. However, cross border movement through such illegal and temporary routes is often reported in the district.

PUNE: The city and 18 other districts are likely to see their first spell of summer rain from Wednesday. Light rains, lightning, thunderstorm, gusty winds, and hail in isolated places, are expected in Pune, Satara , Nashik , Ahmednagar , Aurangabad and many other districts.

Light rain and thundershowers are also expected in Thane, Mumbai on March 26-27, but most of the activity will be in the interior of the state.

Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, India Meteorological Department , Pune, told TOI that the heat load has been going up over Maharashtra. “Temperatures have been on the higher side since the past few days. Along with an upper air cyclonic circulation over South Madhya Maharashtra and north south wind discontinuity from south Tamil Nadu to north Madhya Maharashtra have created ideal conditions for summer’s first spell of light rain to isolated moderate rain, thundershowers, lightning and hail in isolated places in state,” he said.

Day temperatures in Pune shot up to the season’s highest at Shivajinagar and Lohegaon on Tuesday at 37.6 degree celsius and 37.8 degree celsius, respectively. In Akola, the day temperature shot up to 40.3 degrees celsius making it the hottest spot in Maharashtra on Tuesday. The heat load and moisture incursion have acted as a triggering mechanism in creating local level convection in Maharashtra and adjacent areas which will continue for a couple of days.

Kashyapi said two western disturbances have been approaching western Himalayan region, one being over Iran and another over Pakistan. “Also, an induced cyclonic circulation has formed over West Rajasthan and adjacent areas. The combined effect of these has been causing moisture incursion into parts western India including areas of Maharashtra. The availability of this moisture along with major moisture incursion from Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal as well as the increase in heat load over the state is likely to result in adverse weather during the next 4 to 5 days in parts of Maharashtra,” he added.

During the next five days, Konkan is likely to receive very light to light rains including Mumbai on March 27 and 28. “We have forecast light rains at isolated places during the next five days in Madhya Maharashtra too with a chance of thundery activity, lightning. Rainfall will marginally rise and is likely to range from light to moderate at scattered locations in Madhya Maharashtra (including Pune city and Pune district ) on Wednesday as well,” he said.

The spell of light rains is likely to continue in parts of Maharashtra till March 28, he added.

Police took the decision after officials of different departments engaged in emergency services were found crowding the DCP office for passes. Police introduced the pass system to ensure social distancing and not allow unreasonable people out in the streets.

DGP Abhay, who has sent letters to all the district SPs, DCPs and range DIGs, said police were working to develop a web-based system of passes for all exempted people. “Because of lack of capacity and other constraints, pass system during lockdown is not yet robust. Since a web-based system will take time to develop and stabilise, doctors, nurses and healthcare workers employed in government and private hospitals should be allowed to move during lockdown in their vehicles showing their identity cards,” said the DGP’s letter.

Taking a similar line, twin cities police commissioner Sudhanshu Sarangi said people need not panic because they don’t have passes. “People who need to travel because of medical or other emergencies are being allowed to move around if there is a patient or medical paper,” he tweeted. He further said police were cancelling the process of issuing passes to emergency workers as too many people congregated for it. “We will introduce an IT platform to automate the process of issuance of passes,” Sarangi said.

The government has exempted emergency service providers such as employees of health, police, urban local body, fire, bank, telecommunication, postal and hospitals among others from restricting the movement.

On Tuesday, the Khurda administration seized 36 vehicles, which included five cars, for violating lockdown norms. The government on Tuesday came up with the ruling that the movement of essential commodities will not be disrupted due to police check during lockdown.

The government said showing of trade licence will be considered authentic to allow a vehicle transporting essential goods. “Trade licence certificate is given to a trader by the respective urban local body. The trade licence should be photocopied and a copy should be available with the driver of the vehicle transporting the goods. The vehicle should be allowed to move freely without obstruction,” said the government order.

The East Coast Railway (EcoR), divisional railway manager (Khurda), Sashi Kant Singh, has also written to collectors of 12 districts seeking permission for free movement of vehicles carrying essential commodities and railway staff. Even after stoppage of passenger trains, the railways is operating goods train to transport essential commodities, said the letter.

Even some traders, who come under essential services, have downed their shutters out of fear or to support government’s call for maintaining social distance.

Rajdhani Haata Byabasayi Sangha president Gayadhar Swain said the small farmers, who grow vegetables and come in small transporting vehicles, are not coming to the city for two reasons. One, the vegetable growers are afraid that they might contract the virus if they come to Bhubaneswar since two corona positive cases have been detected here. Two, the farmers are not coming because of restrictions. They don’t want to go through gruelling stages to sell the vegetables. Therefore there is limited stock of vegetables resulting in price rise, he said.

The Gandhi market and Unit-I market here are considered two big vegetable markets, which witnesses rush mostly in the evening. Since all the 17 markets have been asked to close down by 6pm, many vendors feel they will get less customers and their stock will rot.

“We will have to sit for hours waiting for customers even with limited stock of vegetable given the present situation. Still, the stock does not exhaust. The problem is with the tweak in timing. You don’t get rush of customers in the afternoon,” said Sridhar Khilari, a trader in the Gandhi market.

The city requires 250-300 tonne of vegetables, which are sold in the markets on a day. “Now we should ensure that there is less surplus of vegetable in the retail market,” Swain added. The Unit-I vegetable market witnesses a footfall of 6,000 every day.

Swain said with the government relaxing vegetable transportation norms by asking drivers to produce only trade licence certificate, the situation will improve. The traders, who now prefer not to come, will carry vegetables in small vehicles. The government has said the furnishing of trade licence will be considered authenticate to allow plying of a vehicle transporting essential goods. Trade licence certificate is given to a trader by the respective urban local bodies.

The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Tuesday decided to appeal to people using different mediums and public address system to provide food to stray animals. A dedicated vehicle will also move in the city with the message. The stray animals, after lockdown, are suffering due to shortage of food source for them.

As a result, the deliverymen refused to provide the service until the issue was resolved and orders given by people on online stores like Big Basket and FreshToHome were cancelled.Later, Delhi Police met representatives of e-commerce companies to facilitate the supply of essential items. A WhatsApp group was set up to report any harassment. Companies like Big Basket, Grofers and MedLife were asked to provide identity cards to their delivery executives, who would also be issued curfew passes.Delhi Police spokesperson Mandeep Singh Randhawa said, “Curfew passes have been issued and police have assured the delivery agents of smooth movement. Delhi Police will be live on Twitter wherein a one-hour session will be held to report any issues.”Saptarshi Chatterjee (32), a resident of Vasant Kunj, said not only did his online delivery for groceries fall through, but his attempt at ordering food online also failed as the deliveryman returned after being allegedly thrashed by police. While the company refunded his money, he is now contemplating stepping out to buy supplies.For those who rely on tiffin boxes, the problem was severe too. A tiffin delivery person in Chilla Gaon in Mayur Vihar-I told TOI that he was unable to complete his deliveries to students and the elderly after being stopped by police. “Some cops stopped my scooty and roughed me up despite me telling them that food delivery was an essential service,” he added.Prakash, a delivery executive with Medlife, said despite having requisite documents, police in Todapur didn’t listen to him. Medlife CEO and co-founder Ananth Narayanan said in a statement, “Prakash was bringing back curfew passes and was hit by policemen on the way to the fulfilment centre. He suffered bruises on his face and body. We also have reports of similar incidents in Bengaluru.”A resident of South Extension-II said that vegetable vendors in her area were being harassed by police. “The vendor told me that cops took money from him,” she added.

PUNE: Police commissioner K Venkatesham on Tuesday assured action against police personnel found caning motorists while implementing Section 144 CrPC orders in the city.“We will identify all such cases and take action if complaints are received. The policemen on the roads have been instructed to follow all the rules and directives issued under Section 144 CrPC. We have directed them not to use force, but the 144 Section orders are as clear as the writing on the wall. People are not to come out on the roads,” Venkatesham said.The assurance followed reports of policemen caning two-wheeler riders and autorickshaw drivers in the fringe areas of the city, including Sinhagad Road. As per motorists, vehicle users were made to hold placards proclaiming that they were ‘enemy of the society’ and they ‘won’t cooperate with the administration’ at some places.When asked about these instances, the police claimed that in most of these cases, the vehicle users were found moving around without any purpose and in defiance of the Section 144 orders. “We have also come across instances where people, who were not willing to go on their jobs or government employees not willing to go for emergency services, claimed that they were being blocked by the police. However, on verification, we have found such claims as incorrect,” Venkatesham said.The Section 144 orders, issued on Monday, have banned movement of all private and non-essential vehicles on the roads as a part of a state-wide lockdown for maintaining the social distancing norm to counter the massive health scare caused by the Covid-19 spread.When contacted, joint commissioner of police Ravindra Shisve said, “We have asked policemen to file cases under Section 188 IPC (disobedience of an order promulgated by a public authority) against the errant vehicle users defying Section 144 orders instead of caning them. If a policeman is using force, it is wrong. Inquiry will be ordered against such high-handed approach.”While the police have identified a list of essential services, which stand exempted from the ban, others have been directed to strictly stay at home or contact the grievance cell numbers for permission to ply their vehicles in case of emergencies like need for medical attention. People are allowed to visit their neighbourhood grocery/vegetable outlets for buying essentials. The police have installed barricades at several junctions for stopping vehicle users, moving around without any purpose, from going any further.Despite these measures, a significant number of two-wheeler riders and motorists ventured out on the roads on Tuesday morning. Senior inspector Anil Patil of the Pune traffic branch told TOI, “Many vehicle users came on the road for buying essentials, vegetables and even articles needed for Gudi Padwa (Marathi New Year) celebrations. We had to counsel them about the prevailing health scare and asked them to return, which they did,” he said.A large number of people were seen at market places like the Gultekdi market yard and on Satara Road, near Pune University chowk , Sinhagad Road, old parts of the city, Yerawada , Vishrantwadi and Deccan Gymkhana. This prompted the police to take “action”.The police chief insisted on optimum use of the grievance cell numbers (see box) by the people to seek clarifications regarding their queries and permission for vehicular movement in case of an emergency. “We are trying to be perfect, but things will take time to settle down. We are helping people in many other ways including blood donation, assistance for PG students and senior citizens,” Venkatesham said.Shisve said, “We are not issuing any fresh orders, but are focusing on the implementation of the Section 144 orders issued on Monday.”A resident of Kalyaninagar who had stepped out to buy some medicines said, “I saw policemen hitting some youngsters on the roads who had ventured out on their scooters and bikes. The police had sticks and they were stopping these men and hitting them. I noticed that they were not troubling women, but the solo riders who were young men were being targeted.”A resident of Shivane near Warje Malwadi said on Monday morning, a vegetable vegetable vendor had to bear the brunt of the police. “When the police noticed more than 10 people gathered near the stall, they first told everyone to leave the stall and then reprimanded the vendor. They also told the vendor to leave the area immediately,” he said.In another incident, the police stopped two youths who were driving the motorcycle. As the duo was not wearing the masks, the police told them to remove their shirts and cover their faces. The duo were then allowed to go.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74805135,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-347503,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-personnel-caning-motorists-will-face-action-says-pune-cp-venkatesham/articleshow/74801323.cms

NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand High Court (HC) on Monday put a stay on the use of heavy machines for mining in the Sarayu river in Bageshwar district.

A bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe gave the order while hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by Bageshwar-resident Pramod Kumar Mehta.

The petitioner had argued in the PIL that the state government, through an advertisement, had asked for public biddings for mining into the river. ""By inviting open bidding, the administration has given approval to use of machines in the river but for years, the mining in the holy river has been done manually. The administration is trying to benefit the mining mafia with such an order and therefore, its illegal,"" Mehta said.

He added that the use of big machines will not only affect the local economy but also lead to environmental degradation. ""The Sarayu river is of immense religious significance and therefore, it is necessary that it is protected,"" Mehta said.

The HC has given three weeks to the state government to respond to the PIL. The court ruled that the case will be heard next when the government files its affidavit.

There were also concerns over the complete breakdown of the social distancing rule.“People panicked after they heard about the lockdown,” said Yuvraj Chaudhary, a resident of Wanowrie. “I saw people rush out of their homes to get to the nearest store. This has also led to overcrowding outside the shops, which increases risk of infection.

I managed to buy enough for my immediate requirements. People rushed because it was not immediately clear if these stores would stay open on Wednesday.”Residents said goods were being sold at extremely high prices. Half a kilo of pumpkin was being sold at Rs 100. A kilo of potatoes was being sold for Rs 90. We have to eat. What if these shops don’t open again?” said one customer.At Sinhagad Road, many residents said they were unable to make purchases because police had shut down shops in the area by noon on Tuesday. “Shops did open later in the evening, but the situation immediately became worse around 8.30pm.

Many ignored the requests,” one resident said.There were also reports of hoarding and bulk buying from Vimanagar, Kalyaninagar, Wadgaonsheri and Wakdewadi areas.

COIMBATORE: In view of Covid-19 pandemic, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the district have shut their operations from 6pm on Tuesday till March 31.

Representatives of 14 MSMEs met district collector K Rajamani and took the decision to shut their units.

With Prime Minister Narendra Modi announcing 21-day nationwide lockdown on Tuesday evening, the MSMEs, however, must decide on extending the shutdown period.

For non-working days, MSME associations have decided to pay their workers and provide them with food and other necessities.

MSME units in the district employ around 1lakh migrant labourers, mostly from northern states, said J James, district president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises (TACT).

“It is our responsibility to provide them with food and safety measures. We would support them,” he said.

While bigger industries have said they would offer full payment to their workers, micro industries, which have already been reeling under crisis, would ensure them at least half their pay.

To meet with payment necessities, MSME associations have sought that the Centre provide them with subsidies for the lock down period and exempt them from ESI and PF.

The associations have also sought that statutory payments such as property tax, water tax, licence fee and electricity bill be deferred for three months.

“The electricity board has asked us to pay the same amount we paid last month as personnel could not take readings. But it is not fair as this month we have operated very little. We should be charged only for what we have used,” said S Surulivel, state vice president of Laghu Udyog Bharati.

MSME representatives also said they would not be able to pay loan dues and EMIs and sought a nil interest on loans and cash credit till the end of the current situation. They also sought a moratorium for one year from now.

R Ramamurthy, president of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association (Codissia) said MSMEs were in no position to pay any dues as they had already been in a crisis and owing to the lockdown. He said the collector had asked the lead bank manager to consider and process their request.

Meanwhile, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday announced that all GST returns for March, April, May and composition returns would be extended to June 30. For companies which have an annual turnover of less than Rs5crore, no late fee or penalty would be charged and for those with annual turnover above Rs5crpre, interest rate would be brought down to 9%.

Having to make sea-change in their approach, dealing with Covid-19 suspected cases or patients, cops are trying to adjust to their new ‘avataar’ foisted upon them overnight by the unprecedented crisis.The different roles assigned to the cops so far against the backdrop of the viral outbreak are ranging from being posted as guards outside the isolation Ward 24 at Mayo hospital where four positive patients are recuperating to avoid any untoward incident like the escape of suspect cases last week to accompanying health officials to track down such quarantine fugitives.Some suspected cases are unwilling to get tested or quarantined and are keeping the cops on their toes with district administration not yielding to their requests. Cops and health officials have been asked to follow such cases persistently and ensure they get tested.The cops have also been assigned the role of checking the persons quarantined at home on a regular basis. Every police station has been provided with a list of quarantined people. Every day cops are visiting their homes and themselves risking getting infected to see whether they are following the orders.Cops are also posted outside the MLA hostel which has been earmarked to quarantine people arriving from other places. They have also taken up the role of preachers and agents of social change through awareness drives and delivering messages for the masses.A senior cop said that it was scary to visit homes of the quarantined people and even worse when the person himself or herself opens the door. “We stepped back with apprehension when a quarantined person opened the door for us. Whenever we ring the door bell, we pray to God not to send the patient for opening the door. Even them peeping out of the window at us leaves us in cold sweat,” he said. “It’s more challenging and tricky when some suspects try to disobey or hide,” said the cop.The issue turned worse with police department delaying purchase and distribution of masks and sanitizers for want of funds for bulk orders following which the top brass had to intervene.City police chief BK Upadhyay said the responsibilities of being part of the fire-fighting team of the government to contain the epidemic had re-moulded their image and re-shaped their convictions. “This newer responsibilities transformed us to a new avataar where we are switching fro from being enforcers to preachers. Suddenly, we realized we were not chasing criminals but helping patients who are generally from common masses who has never dealt with us. We had to scale up our humane side, patiently listening to them and convincing them to follow the norms and save the rest of the society,” he said.Upadhyay said every police station was sending out updates, awareness messages and information to the alert citizens through social media regularly. “We are campaigning on our own and also channelling messages sent to us by the government,” he said. “We are enforcing the norms of keeping road vendors away, keeping paan and tea kiosks closed, shops shut as much as possible. We are also requesting the people to restrict house parties and programmes so as to avoid mass contacts,” said the top cop.Bajaj Nagar police, teamed up with NGO, are extending help to senior citizens and children.

The Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC), as it had announced, established makeshift vegetable markets at Indira Gandhi Municipal Stadium (IGMS), Gymkhana grounds, Patamata High school and other open spaces.

Officials permitted the sale of essential commodities from 6 am to 9 am. A soon as they opened the gates at IGMS stadium, thousands of buyers rushed to the stalls ignoring the announcements made on the mics by municipal authorities. Consequently, the police had to intervene to restore order. But that order lasted momentarily as buyers ignored social distancing and resumed scrambling to buy essential commodities.

Meanwhile, authorities have restricted bulk sale to prevent black marketing. “We have closed Swaraj Maidan Rythu Bazar as it is overcrowded, which increases the risk of the virus spreading. Makeshift market at IGMS is spacious and we have allocated stalls, which are at least three meters away from each other.

COIMBATORE: The curfew that kicked in from 6pm on Tuesday sparked off a major inter– state as well as intra-state reverse migration of people flurrying to get back to their native places.

With train services cancelled, the state transport machinery grappled with milling crowds in all the major transit points across Tamil Nadu, particularly Chennai, Madurai and Trichy. Scores of people started gathering at Walayar check post at Tamil Nadu–Kerala border in Coimbatore district from morning. They were natives of Coimbatore and adjoining districts working in various places across Kerala, anxious to return to their hometowns before the curfew was imposed.

As the health workers struggled to screen everyone and bring in order, there was occasional commotion since the crowd got restless due to the delay.

They were asked to produce documents to show that they hailed from Tamil Nadu. A team of doctors screening the people were taken aback by the unexpected crowd. Much to the disappointment of health workers, several of them failed to cooperate and did not maintain a distance of one metre among them. The health workers also spotted a few trying to bypass the queue to get across the border posing as patients in an ambulance. They were screened and let off with a warning.

“The health department should have appointed more staff for screening anticipating the crowd. Also, if someone is screened at one check-post they should be let off in the next instead of stopping them at every district border,’’ said Goutham, a native of Ooty in Nilgiris district who was travelling from Kerala to Nilgiris.

The chaos started from Koyambedu in Chennai where hundreds thronged the buses heading to cities and towns across Tamil Nadu. Those who managed to squeeze into the buses and reach Madurai had to face a tougher challenge there since transportation to smaller towns down south was not available.

Long distance private buses had one last run with their seats full before they went off road. Some private buses operated special trips from Chennai to Nagercoil, Coimbatore to Nagercoil and Chennai with all the seats booked.

Groups of friends shared their car rides from places like Chennai and Bengaluru to Madurai, Coimbatore and Trichy. “Seeing the crowd at Koyambedu we knew that we could not get a comfortable seat. So, we shared the fuel cost and the toll charges and drove in our car,’’ said Shiju of Nagercoil.

Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) operated around 550 special services in Trichy to clear the rush of passengers who descended from Chennai to head to various districts in Central and south Tamil Nadu on Tuesday morning. This was in addition to the 930 buses operated regularly every day.

“At least 2.5 lakh people travelled to their respective districts from Trichy till Tuesday evening. Most of them have come from Chennai,” said a TNSTC official in Trichy. The buses were gradually reduced towards evening and by the time the curfew set in, they were moved to the depots.

Even after the curfew was imposed many sought to step out into the streets. In Dharmapuri, the police resorted to lathi-charge to chase the crowd near the bus stand in Dharmapuri town on Tuesday evening around 7pm, an hour after the curfew was enforced in the state.

PITHORAGARH: Doctors who have been posted at the inter-state border in Champawat to check for Covid-19 patients are complaining of lack of protective gear. The doctors added that they are forced to work in makeshift camps which don’t have running water or any other basic facilities.

“The Champawat district administration had on Monday sealed the inter-district and international border with Nepal. At the seven entry points in the district, doctors and police personnel have been posted for screening,” said Champawat district magistrate SN Pandey. “Many persons come here from different parts of the country, which is why screening is necessary. Doctors check for symptoms like cough, cold or respiratory problems and ask them where they are coming from,” added the DM.

The doctors, who did not want to be named, said that they had been sent 40km away from their postings and transportation being restricted, they had received few medical equipment. “The district administration has sent us no masks or sanitizers. We have made makeshift camps with no facilities whatsoever. Work is not a problem for us as long as we get proper medical equipment and protective gear,” said one of the doctors.

District Aurvedic and Unani officer Umesh Chandra Pathak admitted that the doctors’ concern was genuine. “We have sent a demand for the equipment to Champawat chief medical officer. The gear should reach the doctors shortly,” said Pathak.

“Till now, the administration has been busy handling the issues of Nepal border and Purnagiri mela. The administration will shortly take care of the scarcity,” said the DM. “The district has four thermal guns. Some will be sent to Almora and Pithoragarh border points as per necessity. The administration will take over government vehicles and provide them to the doctors,” he added.

317,['25/03/2020'],Pune: Response time to WhatsApp travel request messages irks some people,"Policemen enquire about a mototcyclist’s purpose behind venturing out.

PUNE: A section of residents on Tuesday supported the ban imposed on the movement of traffic by the police and hailed the release of WhatsApp numbers to address travel-related queries, but the response time was a sore point for a few.

The city police, on Monday night, shared two WhatsApp numbers for citizens who sought to travel. Two more numbers were added on Tuesday morning and the city police released a format for seeking permission to commute. The applicants concerned need to furnish name, phone number, destination, vehicle number and specific details related to the cause of travel in the WhatsApp message sent to the police seeking permission to travel.

According to a senior officer from the special branch of the Pune police, the WhatsApp numbers were flooded with travel requests. “The special branch, till 4pm, had received over 3,000 requests on WhatsApp and email,” the officer said.

Several citizens stated that they received permission to travel quickly. Twitter user ShashiM had sent a request to the police stating, “Will go to dairy twice a week and once a week to veggie/grocery shop, without bike, alone, walking to neighbourhood store.” The department replied to his request immediately with an “Ok Sir”.

Another city resident had messaged the police on one of the WhatsApp numbers seeking permission for another person to reach the airport at 11.52pm on Monday night. The resident got the approval within minutes.

Getting the travel permission was not easy for all residents, though. Ganeshkhind Road resident Deepti Pundale said, “I had sent a message on the mentioned numbers in the morning fir going to pick up a gas cylinder from the agency but did not get a response till the evening. If we delayed further, the agency would close for the day. My mother and I walked down to the closest junction and spoke to the policemen on duty there. He said cylinder was an essential item and fetched an autorickshaw for us to go and get the cylinder.”

Amee Parikh from the US sent messages to the Pune police WhatsApp numbers seeking travel permission for her father’s caretakers in Pune. “I sent WhatsApp messages on two numbers at 2.30am IST, but not in the given format. On reviewing the tweets, I sent another message as per the format at 7.17am IST. Another message for the second caretaker was sent around 9am, India time. I had sent the messages from both my US and Indian numbers but did not receive a response till Tuesday evening. Both the caretakers reached my father, but they were stopped on the way,” said Parikh.

Kharadi resident Nitin Kamath also tried to seek travel permission but did not get a response till late on Tuesday evening.

The special branch officer said, “We gave permission to many people after verifying their travel requests and a majority of them were still in pipeline on Tuesday evening. Many requests for trivial reasons were categorically rejected.”

Cell to handle commute issues

The city police on Tuesday constituted a dedicated grievance redressal cell to grant permission and exemption for vehicular movement.

The cell would comprise six personnel during the daytime and two at night. Deputy commissioner of police, crime branch, Bachchan Singh, would supervise the functioning of the cell.

“Grievances regarding serious ailments, hospital visits, urgent airport travel and emergency scenarios are being addressed on priority,” said a police officer.

“We are also working towards automating the whole process to smoothen the grievance redressal system,” one of the officers said.

To break the human contact chain, Rangoli Gardens Owner Welfare Society has prohibited the entry of all outside visitors including daily vendors. Bhawani Singh, a resident of the society said, “Since March 21, there has been a ban on the entry of maids, cooks, car cleaners in the premises. Only milk suppliers and newspaper hawkers are allowed. However, their access is till the ground floor of the blocks. Every society needs to take stringent measures likes ours to prevent the virus from spreading.”Though, many residents’ associations have not imposed restrictions on the movement of people, they have stopped allowing any doorstep delivery personnel inside the complexes and have asked the residents to either come to the reception and pick the order by themselves or to collect it later from the security personnel.However, there are many residential buildings where it is expected that the residents are intelligent enough to follow social distancing because of which no restrictions have been put in place. Anand Jain of Girnar Apartment said, “We have not imposed restrictions on people as they are educated and well-informed. Most of them have isolated themselves on their own, but there are a few elderly members in our society who cannot work without domestic help. It will be unfair to them if we make them do so.”Also, there are many apartments where the residents can be seen walking inside the premises without even wearing masks. A resident of Mahima apartment in Jagatpura on the condition of anonymity said, “Many elderly people are walking freely.

MADURAI: The more than 36,000 Class XII students in Madurai district who had appeared for the state board exams this year breathed a sigh of relief as they completed their final exam on Tuesday just before Section 144 was imposed across the state.

A total of 34,869 students sit the final exam in Madurai on Tuesday. Amid the Covid-19 scare, the exams began half an hour late at 10:30 am and ended by 1:30 pm. All the 120 centres here were disinfected and students had to sanitise their hands before entering the exam hall. However, after the exams, students were seen celebrating and running out of the exam halls in groups, prompting police and teachers to discipline them.

Instead of the usual cheers and tears, all students were immediately sent home with many not even returning to their schools to say a farewell. “During our Class X board exam, the whole class celebrated in school with teachers. Today, we were just relived that exams are over instead of getting postponed,” said Sruthi R, a Class XII student of a private school.

Meanwhile, teachers and students said that the new syllabus, introduced for the first time across all subjects, was challenging but not too daunting. “The questions were asked from all chapters for all subjects. Students were quite happy since they did not feel cornered by one or two difficult topics. It may be difficult to get high scores because of everything being new but students can easily get pass marks. We are all hoping for the best,” said the headmaster of a government school.

The evaluation of Class XII board exam answer sheets, in view of the curfews imposed in the state has been tentatively postponed to April 7.

This happened despite the fact that there is 100% ODF coverage in Bihar.

The incident took place around 7am at Haranbadha village under the Maker police station area in Saran district, around 60km north of Patna. A 15-year-old boy was caught defecating in the field of Sanjay Thakur and his brother Sunil Thakur, which led to thrashing of the former on the spot.

When the victim returned home and narrated his ordeal, his mother Ranju Devi (50) went to Thakurs’ house to know about the reason for the assault on her minor son. She was attacked with a sharp-edged weapon causing grievous injuries on her head, which led to her instant death.

When Ranju’s minor son, Subhash, came to the rescue of his mother, he was again beaten up and assaulted with a ‘daab (a sharp edged weapon used to cut hard substance)’ by Sunil and Sanjay. Subhash suffered serious injuries in the process. He was rushed to the local primary health centre from where he was referred to the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH). He, however, succumbed to his injuries on way to the PMCH.

Four other family members — Pana Devi (55), Etbari Thakur (57), Soni Devi (30) and Babli Devi (28) — were injured when they intervened and tried to save the deceased from the clutches of their offenders.

Marhaurha sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Indrajeet Paswan said three of the seriously wounded have been referred to for better treatment. Babli Devi, who suffered minor injuries in the altercation, is undergoing treatment at the local government hospital.

The SDPO said the incident was fallout of an altercation over defecation in the field of Sunil and Sanjay, stated to be neighbours of the deceased. Saran SP Har Kishor Rai said two persons, including the main accused, have been arrested and the weapon used in the crime recovered.

While Sanjay was arrested, his brother Sunil is absconding. The incident has sent shock waves among the residents of the village.

“We have our staff continually sanitising the hospital with Lysol and hypochlorite formulation as recommended. We are also providing the public with hand sanitizers and hand wash liquids to cleanse their hands when entering the hospital,” added Dr Vairavasamy.

The visitors while waiting with their animals have also been asked to maintain a distance of 1 metre between themselves.

The staff are particularly careful in handling sick animals, sanitising their hands before and after handling them. They have been given masks, gloves and caps as well.

“Though we have been asked to not handle any animal which is too sick and seems infectious, taking precautions, we put in our best efforts to save it,” said Dr Vairavasamy.

As per the decision, the local body should have set up the facilities at 50 places.

The local body is unable to set up the facility even in 20 places. “At many places we identified for setting up the facilities, other agencies have installed it. Moreover, there is shortage of wash basins as well. Wash basins are being hired by many agencies,” said corporation health standing committee chairperson Prathibha Ansari. The plan was to set up the facilities at places like market, bus stations, railway stations, etc. Wash basins, soaps and sanitizers are being provided there.

Another plan was to procure one lakh face masks and distribute it among vulnerable persons like vendors at markets who contact many persons every day, autorickshaw drivers, passengers heading to railway stations, taxi drivers, etc. But the local body is unable to procure adequate face masks. “Due to shortage of masks, we were finding its procurement very hard. Now, we have managed to procure an additional of around 25,000 masks. We are distributing them,” said corporation secretary Anu R S. Though the local body planned to buy two infrared thermometers, it could purchase only one. “We are using the thermometer for testing temperature of those visiting the corporation office,” Anu said. “As per the decision, we are distributing food packets to the needy,” she said.

Shortage of staff for cleaning and other activities as part of fighting Covid-19 is another hurdle faced by the local body. “Our health staff like junior public health inspectors are going to the streets and imparting awareness to the public,” Anu said. On Tuesday, corporation staff, along with fire and rescue personnel, visited an apartment complex where 43 persons have been quarantined. As part the efforts to prevent community spread, the entire apartment complex and its surroundings were cleaned using bleaching powder and phenyl. Fogging was also conducted in the area. “Shortage of staff for carrying out the activities in this regard is a problem for us,” Anu said.

Corporation authorities said they are taking measures to ensure that public places like market are clean and hygienic. If a vendor is found to be adopting unhygienic practices, his or her licence should be cancelled. “We are doing the bare minimal work so far as our office administration is concerned. We have turned the entire focus on activities related to the measures to fight Covid-19,” corporation secretary said.

They will stop other state vehicles trying to enter into the district. They will insist drivers and passengers to wear face masks, maintain social distancing as well as follow other guidelines prescribed by the state and the central governments,” she said, adding that “Vehicles and people will be allowed only after sanitising them.”

We have set up 10 checkposts along the city border and they will monitor the situation round the clock,” he said.

Namakkal SP R Arularasu warned that criminal case will be registered against vehicle users especially bikers if they violate Section 144 of the CrPC during the lockdown. “People should not travel on bikes or any other vehicles including cars in the town without any valid reasons,” he said. “People are allowed to use the road only to buy essential commodities such as vegetables, milk, food items and medicines. Violating vehicles will be confiscated, if any cases are registered. Parents will face criminal action if their minor son or daughter violates the government order.”

Erode district collector C Kathiravan said the district administration has taken all the steps to enforce Section 144 in the district. “We have asked vegetable vendors to open their shops only between 6am and 10am. Farmers and merchants those who have identity cards will be allowed in the Uzhalavar shandies during this period. Street hawkers and vendors will not be allowed to set up shops,” he said.

He added that in the past, teachers and employees have played a crucial role while dealing with natural disasters.

Meanwhile, some teachers took to Twitter to reach out to their respective collectors and offer their services.

LUCKNOW: The stock in grocery stores is also drying up due to decline in supply, mainly because many wholesalers have shut shop due to restrictions imposed to check the spread of coronavirus. Many said that they will be left with no stock of wheat, oil, rice, pulses and other essential items over the next 10 days.

“Since all supermarkets and big provision stores are closed, people are flocking to small grocery stores in their localities. This has resulted in increase in demand. However, the supply is short as many wholesalers and dealers have closed down following the lockdown. Though these services are exempted, employees at many places have stopped coming in view of the corona threat,” said Tarun Jaiswal , a grocery shop owner in Aliganj .

Ramesh Ahuja, a store owner in Gomtinagar, said that there has been no major shortfall in supply of big brands through authorised agencies, but supply of local brands and loose wheat, rice, flour, pulses and oils have stopped.

“For me, stock of branded products is exhausting at a rapid pace. If this continues, we will neither have branded nor local ration to sell,” said Mohd Naaem , a grocery shop owner in Jankipuram .

ADM civil supplies RD Pandey said, “Supply of ration will not be stopped. We will come up with a solution within next five days.”

With UK going into a Covid-19-triggered lockdown , many have been asked to check out of hotels and homestays by March 31. Since flights between UK and India were suspended on March 18, the young medics have been left in the lurch, trying to get in touch with the Indian High Commission in London seeking visa extension and alternative accommodation. But till Tuesday morning, they have got no response from the Indian authorities. PLAB 2 — taken by medical graduates from all over the world to join the national health service in UK — has now been postponed to July.Calcutta National Medical College graduate Priyadarshini Bhattacharjee had landed in Manchester on March 10 along with several other doctors from Kolkata. They had no idea that the exam could be postponed till they received a mail on March 16 from the General Medical Council, which conducts the exam, that PLAB 2 has been cancelled. “We were not ready for this and tried to return immediately. But a scamper for tickets had already started and most of us failed to book a berth on any of the last flights. We have mailed to the Indian High Commission in London but did not get a reply. Some of us have our visas expiring soon and others have accommodation issues,” said Priyadarshini. Even though she has got July 22 as her new exam date, Priyadarshini is not sure if she will return.While she is lucky to be hosted by a ‘kind family’ which has allowed her to stay back, many of her fellow examinees are in trouble. “I know of 5-6 candidates from Kolkata who will run out of funds if they can’t return by March 31. Also, some of them have been asked to move out of their hotels once their booking expires on March 31,” she said.Sayantan Basu and Sharodia Mitra — both NRS graduates — are stuck in Manchester. “We are in a fix and will be in deep trouble if we can’t return by the end of the month. It has become difficult for us to fund our stay since we had expected to return by March 22 and are now left with very little money. We hope that the high commission will arrange an accommodation for us,” said Sayantan. He added that one of his friends from India — a doctor from Delhi — has been served a notice by his landlord asking him to vacate his rented apartment by this week.Priyadarshini was booked on an Emirates flight in late-March that got cancelled. “I tried for a berth on March 18 — the last day that flights operated from UK — but they were full. Now, I plan to return in mid-April, provided my visa gets extended. I have no idea what’s going to happen if it doesn’t. It is difficult for us to cope up in foreign land during a worldwide crisis such as this, with little support from our country.

CHENNAI: Grocery stores, bus stands and Tasmac shops -- that’s where most of the city congregated on Tuesday before the lockdown came into effect. As the day dawned bright and clear, people rushed to neighbourhood stores to stock up on provisions. People crowded stores in Anna Nagar, Choolaimedu , Saidapet, Triplicane, Royapetah, Mylapore and T Nagar.

“I was not planning to stock up but many people were coming and buying things. I realised the seriousness when I found out that the packet of milk powder I picked up was the last one in the shop,” said P Anusuya, a resident shopping at a store on Ellis Road.

The sense of hurry was palpable – whether it was on the busy road or in the shops and small businesses that continued to function. By noon, a few shops started to run out of supplies such as milk powder. Along with noodles, biscuits figured high on the list for customers, who feared stocks may be scarce in the coming days.

Despite the heat and humidity, Zam Bazaar market was bustling with activity at noon and also later in the day when the 6pm deadline drew near. People rushed to buy fruits, vegetables, rice, wheat flour, coconut oil and milk products, with many buying provisions in bulk. They feared that the neighbourhood grocer or supermarket may not get supplies during the lockdown.

“I have stocks but I am not sure whether I will be getting fruits and vegetables from tomorrow. Everything that we sell here comes from Andhra and a few other districts in Tamil Nadu . I do not know how long it will take for the supplies to arrive,” said Mahesh , a fruit shop owner.

With people as well as retail outlets rushing to stock up, vegetable prices in Koyambedu market soared. For the first time, wholesale prices of some of the vegetables were higher than the retail prices. Tomato was sold at Rs 25 per kg in retail outlets while it was priced Rs 40 per kg in Koyambedu. While onions and potatoes sold at Rs 30 and Rs 33 at retail, sellers at Koyambedu charged Rs 10 more.

The Koyambedu bus terminus also saw a lot of activity as people hailing from southern and western districts desperately looked for buses so that they could reach their hometowns before authorities locked the borders. Auto drivers made a killing fleecing passengers who wanted to reach the stand.

Yet another place saw people jostling with one another so that they could stock up for the dry days ahead – Tasmac outlets were crowded from the moment they opened at noon. People with bags in hand waited patiently throughout the afternoon but as the 6pm deadline neared, there was a mad rush. In Choolaimedu, the staff had a tough time dealing with people when it was time to down the shutters. People even prised open the shutters and demanded that they continue to sell booze.

In Zam Bazaar, as the lockdown began, police asked all shop owners, and also restaurants to close. Only medical shops and pushcarts selling fruits were spared. People quickly converged on the vendors to buy the last of their produce.

“They told us in the afternoon that we can function but now they say that it is better to close when the shutdown begins. The police said that we can open in the morning,” said N Mani, who runs an eatery.

Post 6pm, police patrolled the city, asking traders to shut shops. Just as quickly, silence fell over the city, and the main thoroughfares looked deserted. The busy city settled down for the night, and braced for the long fight ahead. 21 days.

Even the heavy vehicle factory (HVF) in Chennai that makes battle tanks has been roped in for the job. Chemical factories making TNT and RDX are gearing up to make sanitisers. In the wake of lockdown the factories have already closed production of the regular defence items.Sources said since the sanitisers will have to be made in chemical factories under OFB, there are chances it may be taken up at factories in Chandrapur and Bhandara in Vidarbha also. The masks will be made at the clothing factories spread throughout the country. There are plans to take up manufacturing of ventilators also which are also in short supply in the country. A decision about ventilators is yet to be taken.The request has come from the government to the directorate general of OFB.In turn, a letter has been sent to the factories. There are plans to make 2 lakh masks and 10,000 overall covers, and 5000 litres of sanitisers. A source in the board said this will be an intial quantity to establish that the factories can make these items too. In fact, the ordnance factory at Khamaria that makes a wide range of ammunition from aerial bombs to hand grendades has already prepared the initial quantity of sanitizers.A letter in possession with TOI states the material may be needed for people living in the factories’ estates, but sources said it may be provided to general public too.

376,['25/03/2020'],"Be on guard, fraudsters may cash in on virus fear: Cops","Kolkata: The cyber cell of Kolkata Police CID and cyber experts have advised people that they should be careful while downloading information about the coronavirus . They have also warned people of opening any SMS that claimed to be sent by the Government of India, asking users to download “necessary documents”. The advisory came from the police on Tuesday when some people reportedly received texts from unknown numbers, which asked them to download mobile apps to get details of coronavirus. Cops said that fraudsters used this trick to get access to the mobiles of those whom they had sent the texts.Though no specific case has been registered yet in this regard, cops have come across such texts, where they found some fraudsters from Jharkhand tried to dupe people worried about the Covid-19 outbreak.“The fraudsters keep changing their modus operandi. Last year, they had used the World Cup frenzy while they had played the same trick in the name of a popular game show in 2018. Since everybody is on the tenterhooks for the coronavirus scare, the fraudsters are trying to make the most out of the situation,” said a police officer. According to cyber security experts, the spam texts include offers on masks, survival guides and even medically-unsupported Covid-19 treatments like CBD oil. Links within the spam SMS take people to other fake sites where they fall into the traps of the fraudsters and lose money. A CID officer said the risk of organized crime was most likely from the virtual world as the state had been in lockdown and people were not stepping out of their houses.Cops said that it is virtually impossible to trace the money once it is siphoned off. “The gangs use the details of their targets to hack into their accounts. They start recharging mobile numbers over the internet. Each of these mobile numbers used to send SMS is directly connected to different accounts of ‘mobile money’. These mobile money providers earmark one ‘wallet’ against each cell number. The gang transferred the victims’ money to such wallets over internet. This makes it difficult for cops to trace the money,” said a police officer.The recharge operators kept around 30% as commission. Police said no one should divulge personal details over phone.“We have been continuously telling people that banks don’t deal with customers over phone. No bank asks for PIN or CVV number over phone,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/be-on-guard-fraudsters-may-cash-in-on-virus-fear-cops/articleshow/74801008.cms

AHMEDABAD: Even after instructions from the Gujarat food and drug control administration (FDCA), to not sell hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin without prescriptions, several chemists across Ahmedabad have run out of stock of hyrdoxychloroquine. After a social media message went viral that these drugs are effective for treatment of Covid-19, several people bought these drugs as a preventive measure.

“A lot of people bought hydroxychloroquine till the government imposed restrictions on its sale without prescription. We have run out of stock for the past two days and are not sure when the new stock will arrive. Due to the lockdown, supply of medicines and all other items has fallen,” said Arvind, who manages the franchise of a chain of pharmacies on Anandnagar Road.

Manish Shah, the manager of a standalone medical store in Makarba also said he had run out of stock of hydroxychloroquine as well as azithromycin. “A lot of people bought these medicine in the past week. We have placed an order for more stock and are likely to receive it in a few days. However, now there will be restriction on the sale by the state government.”

Industry sources said that despite warnings, many people bought these medicines as a preventive measure. Gujarat principal secretary (health) Jayanti Ravi on Monday said that the state received guidelines from the central government for use of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine for treatment of Covid-19 patients.

“The mix is found to be effective and the state has adequate stocks of these medicines. These medicines are not for preventive or prophylactic use and will be available only against prescription,” Ravi told reporters on Monday evening.

According to the Federation of Gujarat State Chemists and Druggists’ Association (FGSCDA), these medicines are rarely used and therefore may not be readily available, but this doesn’t mean there is a shortage. “These medicines are used for specific purposes and are procured in limited stock. There is no shortage in the market and these drugs will be made available with prescriptions at chemist stores,” said Alpesh Patel, president, FGSCDA.

A railway officer pointed out that the entire department was scared. “This man had been a friend of the deceased and had even helped his family admit him to a nursing home.

What he’s incapable of doing is stopping thinking about the next day and what the future holds for him and his family while in his solitary self-confinement.

As the state today has 11,108 persons under 14-day home quarantine, their mental health is a growing concern for not only their families but society.

Dr Kalrav Mistry, a city-based psychiatrist, said individuals have difficulty dealing with uncertainty. “As Covid-19 is a new phenomenon, we don’t know what to expect. It leads to anxiety. Its different how different individuals cope with it. Thus, along with the physical well-being of these individuals, their mental well-being is equally important for their recuperation and assimilation in society,” he said.

Thus, the Government Hospital for Mental Health (GHMH) on Tuesday conducted a special session for health workers and caregivers with emphasis on coping with Covid-19.

Dr Ajay Chauhan, medical superintendent, GHMH, said those who are termed positive and those who in quarantine have a lot of questions and apprehension. “They are influenced by images in the media and have fears about what can happen to them.

Thus, it’s important that immediate caregivers understand this condition and try to quell their distress,” he said.

He added that in some cases, epidemics can also lead to post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). “Mental health professionals will provide telephonic counselling and also visit these persons if necessary. We will also follow up with patients after they are out of quarantine,” said Dr Chauhan.

KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday made the rounds of all the major government hospitals in the city, asking after the doctors , paramedics and health workers in the frontline of the battle against the novel coronavirus and advising them caution. The CM’s visit, which included Beliaghata ID Hospital , where all the Covid-19 patients are being treated and New Town’s quarantine centre, where several of the corona suspects are housed, came as a moral boost for the health workers.

“Apnara bhalo thakle amrao bhalo thakbo (Our well being is in your safety and good health),” the CM told health workers, whom she gave masks and sanitizers. She promised more personal protection equipment from the health department to ensure safety for doctors and all others handling Covid-19 patients.

Accompanied by Kolkata Police commissioner Anuj Sharma, Banerjee first went to R G Kar Hospital, where she urged officials and health workers to be extremely cautious during the treatment of patients. Even as she advised all health staff, including those involved in cleaning the hospital, to strictly observe safety norms, she requested the doctors and nurses to don masks and repeatedly wash hands to stay safe. Given that many were finding it difficult to commute to the hospital from far during the lockdown, Banerjee told the principal and superintendent of RG Kar Medical College & Hospital that the state government was in the process of hiring hotels, where doctors and nurses living far would be accommodated during the period. Apprehensive that the number of patients might rise, R G Kar is set to have a 50-bed quarantine facility.

Banerjee’s next stop was at Medical College and Hospital, where she enquired about the progress of work in converting the entire hospital into a Covid-19 treatment facility. The CM had earlier asked state health officials to evacuate all patients from the hospital and prepare it exclusively for Covid-19 patients. The hospital authorities told her they had started discharging the non-critical patients and trying to shift critical ones to other hospitals. The facility would be ready to handle 3,000 Covid-19 patients by next week, Banerjee was told. Next, she visited NRS Medical College and Hospital, where she discussed the health conditions of doctors and nurses as well as interns. It is the latter who are now serving corona patients at the hospital. She advised repeatedly caution to all.

At SSKM Hospital, she asked the authorities how the infrastructure could be improved immediately to handle more corona-affected patients whose numbers are expected to multiply in the weeks ahead. She also enquired about the testing facility at SSKM Hospital and patient turnout.

Around 5pm, Banerjee reached the quarantine centre at New Town, where she discussed how to step up the infrastructure further. Several corona-suspects are currently housed there. Banerjee asked after their health status and wished them speedy recovery. She donned the N95 mask at the centre and asked everyone around her to maintain social distancing norms. The CM also asked the health workers to be very careful about the health status of their family members as the virus could spread easily. “Your moral health and well-being will help us fight this challenge,” she said.

Her penultimate stop was the Beliaghata ID Hospital, currently the ground zero in the state’s efforts to fight the virus. Praising health workers for their professionalism, she discussed how the existing resources could be used even better. “We have a long battle on our hands,” she said and thanked the staff for their dedication before heading to MR Bangur Hospital to inspect its 150-bed isolation facility. Here, too, she had words of encouragement for health professionals.

AHMEDABAD: Ever since a partial lockdown has been imposed in Ahmedabad to curb further spread of COVID-19, the movement of all public transport vehicles including cabs and autorickshaws has been strictly restricted. The restricted movement of vehicles would have hampered movement of scores of travellers who landed at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad on Tuesday, however, Ahmedabad city police officials came to their rescue by issuing special permission to private cabs to ferry passengers.

With no cabs and private vehicles available at the airport, a number of passengers who did not have someone picking them up, were left hassled and confused on how to get home. “We saw several passengers walking hassled around the airport when we realized that they are unable to move due the restriction on movement of cabs as well as other modes of public transport. The ACP and DCP took a decision to issue special permission to cab drivers to ferry the passengers,” said K C Rathwa, police inspector, Airport Police Station.

“We contacted a few cab drivers who are regularly visiting the airport and they later informed other cabbies to help passengers move to their destinations. A special letter was issued to each cabbie by the police station, enabling one to move in the city only to drop the concerned passenger and return to the airport, based on which several passengers were sent home,” Rathwa further added.

At least 350 passengers who landed at the city airport on Tuesday, were facilitated by the city police officials by issuing special permission to cab drivers. To prevent further spread of COVID19 pandemic, the Union government has announced discontinuing of all commercial passenger flights from 11.59pm on Tuesday and therefore, airport saw unprecedented rush of passengers who arrived in Ahmedabad on Tuesday.

KOLKATA: The state transport department is running a skeletal bus services for frontline health workers, hospital staff, patients’ relatives, security personnel and employees of medicine shops so that these citizens working in emergency services are not stranded during the lockdown.

West Bengal Transport Corporation, the state transport undertaking that serves the Kolkata metropolitan area, has deployed buses to and from all major hospitals since early on Tuesday so that health workers and patients’ relatives did not face commute problems.

According to an order of the chief secretary, these emergency routes were chalked out, based on demand. “But we are ensuring that no crowding takes place and commuters can maintain safe distance from each other. A hourly frequency is maintained and identity card or hospital admission tickets are being checked before allowing them to board the buses,” said a WBTC official.

WBTC, officers said, was maintaining safety protocols. All bus crew have been given protective gears, like gloves, masks, aprons and sunglasses. After each ride, the interiors were being sanitized. The sterilization workforce are also given personal protective equipment to safeguard themselves against possible infection. Each and every commuter is being given hand sanitizer. “We are trying our best to support emergency services in this demanding time,” said RVS Kapur, managing director WBTC.

On the contrary, there were not many to catch the last flight to their homes.In the eerie silence, a dozen of passengers who had reached Jaipur from Hyderabad in the afternoon flight could be seen haggling with a taxi driver at the outer entry gate of the city airport. He was asking Rs 2,000 to drop them at Tonk Phatak and there was not a second taxi around to turn to.On the road to airport from Jawahar circle, where on normal days cars would zip through, the emptiness was overpowering. A few people could be seen walking down towards the airport with their bag and baggage. It’s hard to notice taxis or private cars.“The airport handles around 55 flights a day but today we have only 25. Despite the reduction in number of flights, not many passengers are there. That's why the level of activity has declined in the airport,” said airport director Jaideep Balhara.With the city under lockdown and transport services having been shut down for travelling from Jaipur to other towns and villages, the demand for air travel has also come down significantly.“We don't know how to reach Sikar. We came from Hyderabad but now the challenge is to go to Sikar. One of our friends is coming in a car to pick us but he said he is having to plead with police who don't allow him,"" said a youth in another group of seven sitting at a bus stop.He said this is another reason why people are not travelling because it is tough to travel to home towns from the airport.The police manning the checkpoints to restrict movement of people at Jawahar circle said they allow people who show air tickets. But family members or friends going to receive those arriving are not allowed by the police.""As such it is very hard to control people. They give you false excuses to move around. That's why if there is a proof behind the travel and if it merits a permission, we allow.

394,['25/03/2020'],Flyers throng airport just before domestic flights are grounded,"The city airport witnessed crowd for the entire day on Tuesday

Nagpur: From urbane frequent flyers to rustic workers, everyone reached Nagpur airport on Tuesday to reach their homes before even the last flight was grounded. Still low by normal standards, yet the number of passengers reaching Nagpur went up significantly compared to last one week. TOI inquired with travellers who said flights were nearly full as this was the last chance to reach their destinations.

The last flight of Indigo Airlines scheduled to reach Nagpur at 8pm and supposed to take off for Bengaluru in half an hour reached by 10:10pm. It quickly turned around and took off for Bengaluru by 10.35pm. The turn around could happen fast as there were only 59 passengers and there was no rush at the airport. It takes an hour and thirty five minutes to reach Bengaluru. Four aircraft that could not fly further due to the timings will remain parked at Nagpur, said a source.

The counter of a private airlines was thronged with flyers buying tickets just before they boarded, a scene resembling railway ticket window. As against 34 flights normally scheduled on Monday, the Nagpur airport had only 20 flights operating. The rest were cancelled.

TOI reached the airport in the noon and could find passengers coming from Mumbai and Ahmedabad as well as those leaving for Delhi and Chennai.

A group of young boys engaged as labourers and other work at mobile tower sites waited for their contractor, standing near the departure terminal. The contractor quickly bought tickets for Delhi from the counter. They had to reach their villages close to the national capital.

Soon a group of Tamil speaking workers and site engineers alighted from an SUV. Engaged by a sugar factory here, they were rushing to catch the flight to Chennai. They were followed by Kartik and Singanayakan who move door-to-door selling utensils, even they had to reach Chennai due to an emergency.

Despite the rush, inquiry at the airlines’ counters showed that there was no spike in ticket rates. Many travellers who bought last minute tickets paid Rs3600 to 4,000 which is the normal fare, they said.

However, the taxi operators were seen making a killing. The fares charged by the operators designated by the airport had gone up to Rs1000 to 1,200 per person. Some autorickshaw drivers were offering motorcycle rides for Rs500 to 400 per person. “Just keep your boarding pass ready to show the cops if they stop,” said Ramesh Thakre who was offering bike rides.

Manish Patidar, who had came in GoAir’s flight from Ahmedabad, said he had gone to Anand in Gujarat to meet his sister who had also come from abroad. He has to fly back to London in April, so he reached back in time. “As the flight was nearly 80% full, passengers were sitting close by but there was no scare as such and the scene remained normal all through the journey,” said Laxman Patel from the same flight. Of course, the flight attendants were also wearing masks, added another.

The fight from Ahmedabad was the last of GoAir’s flight to reach Nagpur on Monday. The pilots went back as passengers in a different airlines’ aircraft. Swapnil Suryawanshi had to wait for nearly three hours before he could start his further journey for Chhindwara in Madhya Pradesh. As no transport was available, his relatives came down from Chhindwara to pick him up.

Kalwant Singh who reached the airport from Parseoni was stranded after his flight to Delhi was cancelled.

After the shutdown, minimal staff will remain at the airport to carry out essential services. Even the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel will be partially returned for the airport’s security. The air traffic control tower will continue operations for international flights overflying Nagpur. The airport will be ready for emergency services and operations of government and defence aircraft.

With international flights already off the radar since Sunday, Kolkata airport has shut down completely and will reopen only when the DGCA makes a fresh assessment on Covid-19 threat.“The last set of departures were over by 9.30pm and we had intimated airline officials to wrap up their proceedings and staff as and when their operations got over so that we can shut down the airport as per the government mandate at the stroke of midnight,” said airport director Kaushik Bhattacharjee. Following the shutdown, the airport authorities will take up a massive decontamination and disinfection drive in the terminal, similar to the one that had been carried out in international wing of the terminal on Monday.Meanwhile, passengers making a final dash to return home before the flight ban had a harrowing time on landing at Kolkata airport as they struggled to find a transport back home at a time when the city is under lockdown.Marketing consultant Satyajit Mukherjee had reached the airport from Bangalore on Tuesday but failed to find any transport to Garia. Finally, he called his brother who came all the way to the airport to pick him up, that too, with an “airport emergency” handwritten sticker pasted on the bike.Hired cabs that operated also made a killing. While Rishra resident Ranjit Kumar Singh said he had to pay Rs 1,600 for a ride to Hooghly from airport, another elderly couple said they had to pay Rs 1,200 for a ride till Belghoria. “I had no option but literally beg before the driver to take us home and that too for steep price of Rs 1,600,” said Singh, who returned from Guwahati. Several stranded flyers also took to social media to vent their frustration against the lack of transport options. The only help was from a few government buses that left the airport at long intervals and travelling to fixed destinations like Howrah station.“Passengers to please note, #Kolkata is under lockdown & taxis/cabs are not available at the airport.

This could be the biggest turning point in the fight against coronavirus outbreak as our testing capacity will increase significantly. Interestingly, one of the brains behind development of this ‘Made in India’ diagnostic kits is Dr Gautam Wankhede, a Nagpurian.An alumni of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Dr Wankhede is trained in the United Kingdom where he specialized in transfusion medicine. He is the son of Dr Ravi Wankhede, who pioneered the preparation and use of blood components in Central India in 1989 and later led the Zonal Transplant Coordination Center (ZTCC), Nagpur, as its secretary for many years.“Mylabs is planning to supply first batch by Thursday. Currently, we have manufacturing capacity for 15,000 tests per day and we will increase it up to 25,000 soon,” said Dr Wankhede. He is credited with launching some pathbreaking concepts in India such as molecular blood grouping and antenatal red cell antibody screening.“We already have raw material and been in the molecular diagnostics manufacturing for the last three to four years. So, we can start supplying kits immediately. Majority of components used in our kit are from India,” he said. They import a very few components from other countries, but not from China.Apart from Mylabs , German company Altona Diagnostics has also applied for an import licence from the Drug Controller General of India. But, this company cannot start supplying kits to labs before next week.Speaking to TOI, his proud father Dr Ravi said, “Gautam got inspired to take transfusion medicine as he watched our blood bank activities quite closely. After coming back from the UK, he worked with Fortis-Escorts Hospital and later moved over to the industry side,” he said.Dr Gautam was involved in the development and patenting a transfusion safety system ‘Haemovigil’ that is now being used in leading hospitals across India. Many reputed laboratories in the country are using ID-NAT screening kits for blood banks/hospitals, quantitative HIV, HBV and HCV kits, all developed under his supervision.Mylab is aiming to manufacture up to 1 lakh tests in a week. Further, the company claims that its test kits can test about 100 patients with one kit.

397,['25/03/2020'],"1,800 going north given food, sent back to Ahmedabad","By 5pm, the district police had distributed 1,800-odd food packets.

AHMEDABAD: On Tuesday, the first day of the state’s lockdown, the Gandhinagar police officials were surprised as hundreds from the direction of Ahmedabad were seen in areas such as Nana Chiloda, Mota Chiloda and Adalaj.

When the persons were questioned and were asked reason for flouting CrPC Section 144 – related to ban on assembly of more than four persons – the groups told cops that they were daily wagers especially working in small units and construction sites and as the work was closed indefinitely, they don’t even have a day’s meal.

Mayur Chavda, Gandhinagar SP, said that the persons were stopped and district police along with volunteers were mobilized. “Our staff supervised making and distribution of food packets when we realized that the groups intend to cover distance of over 100km on feet as all public transport is suspended,” he said. “Makeshift counters were created as a few teams even tracked many down on the roads and supplied them with food packets and water bottles.”

By 5pm, the district police had distributed 1,800-odd food packets. When Gandhinagar police contacted Ahmedabad administration, the officials advised not to allow the persons to go northwards and asked police to send them back to Ahmedabad. Police officials said that the district administration would take care of the groups now.

398,['25/03/2020'],"On first day, cops arrest 1,003 for violating lockdown rules","Kolkata: Kolkata Police arrested 1,003 people on the first day of the lockdown for not adhering to restrictions imposed to contain novel coronavirus and sent home the message that they meant business while implementing the shutdown order.

The police adopted a carrot-and-stick policy from early Tuesday morning as they went about implementing the complete safety restriction. Among those booked was a man driving a luxury car at Esplanade and another drinking in the open at Convent Road in Entally. But it was the south division that had the maximum arrests — 271 — followed by the south suburban division.

Lalbazar received clippings from markets like Gariahat and Garden Reach where people not only defied the lockdown but also challenged the cops over ‘right to free movement’. Several shops were kept open, prompting cops to forcibly shut them across several pockets of north and south Kolkata. A middle-aged man on Rashbehari Avenue even questioned why he could not enjoy a walk in a desolate street when he had no recent travel history of visiting a coronavirus-affected country.

In the densely populated north Kolkata, police entered a locality at a time and challenged anyone who was found outside his home. “This is not an easy place to enforce a lockdown. Hence, we have to do it with a firm hand,” said an officer.

A majority of the arrested comprised youths aged 20 to 27, who had ventured out for a chat with friends or had taken their bike out for a spin. In several pockets of the city like Tiljala, Topsia, Park Circus, Rajabazar and Maniktala, police had a tough time enforcing the lockdown as bike-borne youths sped past the checkposts that had been set up. Youths were also found gossiping by the roadside or crowding around teastalls. Cops, armed with batons, went on an overdrive in some localities, chasing violators and arresting those who refused to disperse.

“We have deployed all our officers on the road who have been pleading and at times forcing people to get back to their homes. But there are instances when the men were back on the road the moment our team left the area. They need to understand that we are trying to implement the lockdown for their safety,” said a senior officer of Topsia police station.

The scene was similar at Rajabazar and Park Circus where residents called up police stations, urging cops to take action against shops selling non-essential items that had opened and about men loitering in the road. On VIP Road, too, men were spotted moving in herds atop mini-trucks and in ambulances. When the violation was pointed out, the cops gave a chase but didn’t arrest anyone.

In Salt Lake, youths were seen riding bikes and driving cars around PNB crossing. When police stopped them to ask what they were doing on the road, they cited flimsy reasons. Councillor Anindya Chattopadhayay joined the cops to explain the urgency for them to return home and follow the lockdown rules.

At checkposts in Kolkata, police did let people through if they cited valid reasons for being out during the lockdown. In Santoshpur, cops asked those who were outside to stop making excuses and go in. “We don’t want to use force. Please abide by the law,” a policemen told a group.

But there were odd allegations about police excesses too. A youth in Baguiati claimed he had been beaten by cops when he had stepped out to buy medicines. In the morning, the Vidyasagar traffic guard stopped six vehicles — coming from as far as Delhi, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar — on the second Hooghly bridge. Coming to know that they were migrant labourers, the cops shifted them to a quarantine centre.

In Howrah, police had to canvass on the lockdown with loudspeakers. “Don’t treat this like a bandh. The consequences of staying out can be serious and can affect your entire family,” a policeman said over a louspeaker.

Back in Kolkata, police commissioner Anuj Sharma tweeted: “I appeal to all citizens to #StayHome and cooperate with the administration. @KolkataPolice will continue the drive against violators. #CoronavirusPandemic.”

But these stores are part of emergency services exempted from the lockdown; every household would have people who need their daily dose of medicines. There should be some way to keep at least some chemists’ stores open in every area/neighbourhood.

KOLKATA: Supply of medicines may be impacted in the coming weeks not because of stock deficit but due to the suspension of trains and buses that is making it difficult for staff members to commute.On Tuesday, the first day of lockdown, many medical stores operated with skeletal staff as those who come from far-flung areas were unable to attend work as there were no local trains and buses. Several medical stores around the city were also shut because either the owner or the workers could not commute.Medical stores can remain open during the lockdown as it falls under the essential supply category.Anirban Mitra of College Street Blueprint said he was in the shop for the whole day with only one employee. “We have adequate stock for the next seven to 10 days. Since this is an essential supply, the stock will be replenished soon. But we are facing problems of a different kind. We do not have enough staff to run the shop. Many of them stay in the suburbs and have not been able to come to work today. If the situation remains like this, we do not know how we will keep the shop open for such a long time,” said Mitra.“We ran out of masks and sanitizers a week ago and that has not been replenished. People are buying a lot of paracetamol, medicine for common cold and oral rehydration salts. But we have enough supply,” he added.A representative of Apollo Pharmacy on GC Avenue said: ""There is no reason to panic as we have adequate stock to last two weeks and our employees have come to work as they have identity cards.”Suresh Goel, who owns Medical Plus on Mahatma Gandhi Road, did not open his store on Tuesday as local trains are not plying and other modes of transport were not available. “I stay in Belur and commute on local train and bus to reach my shop on Mahatma Gandhi Road. I could not go to my shop because trains and buses are not plying. Even if I manage to reach my shop, I will face immense difficulty in returning home at night,” said Goel.The news from the stockists is not as good. In Kolkata, the stockists keep medicines for up to 15 days. Sajal Gangopadhyay, secretary of the Bengal Chemists’ and Druggists’ Association, said the companies have not supplied any consignments since 3pm on Monday. “They said they do not have the staff. If this problem is not resolved, the stock will start depleting and we won’t be able to replenish it. There may be a crisis after 15 days,” said Gangopadhyay.Many stockists said they do not requisition big consignments just before the end of the financial year. “We have to clear payments and reconcile the stock before the ending of the financial year on March 31. The orders are placed much in advance and we did not know we will be facing such an unprecedented situation. But we do have enough stock for the coming days, but the problem is there are no staff members, goods vehicles and even the retailers are not coming,” said Chandresh B Sanghvi, general secretary of the Calcutta Wholesale Medicine Market Area Committee of Bengal Chemists’ and Druggists’ Association.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74802330,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-579829,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/stocked-up-but-chemists-face-acute-staff-crunch/articleshow/74800334.cms

402,['25/03/2020'],Kolkata: Respite from panic buying short-lived,"Koley market wears a nearly empty look on Tuesday morning

KOLKATA: Following the announcement of a 21-day nationwide lockdown, panic buying returned to the city markets on Tuesday evening. Immediately after the announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , people rushed to buy staples. The grocery stores in the city had long queues of buyers wearing masks. Within an hour, items flew off the shelves.

Shankar Adhikari, owner of Annapurna Bhandar of Behala, said, “I exhausted my stocks in the last one hour. People were confused. If delivery does not come tomorrow, I have to shut down my store. Hopefully, things will normalize in a day or two.” A similar situation prevailed across the city. In some areas police had to intervene to maintain the queue in front of grocery stores.

Senior bureaucrats of food and civil-supplies and agriculture marketing department assured that there is no dearth of staples and vegetables in the state. Since, we are already under lockdown, the same restrictions will apply for next few days. People must keep their cool and purchase things judiciously,” said the officers.

A semblance of normalcy returned to the markets briefly across the city on Tuesday when prices of perishable commodities dropped a little. Those who burnt holes in their pockets in panic buying on Monday regretted as prices plunged nearly 50%. However, the gap between the wholesale and retail prices is yawning and enforcement agencies have a role in reducing the gap.

The crowd in the city markets thinned considerably on Tuesday. However, some vendors who come by trains, could not reach the markets. Most of the stalls had limited stocks of varieties of fish other than Rohu and Katla.

“Yesterday, we had limited supply, but a huge number of buyers. This automatically spiked the price of each vegetable. Customers bought double or triple of their daily requirements. Today, the opposite happened. There is enough supply yet fewer customers,” said Gautam Rakshit, a vegetable vendor at Behala market.

There was a steady supply of vegetables and fruits to the city wholesale markets and prices dropped. However, the sharp drop is wholesale prices of vegetables did not reflect proportionally on the retail prices. The difference between the wholesale and retail prices should not be over Rs 3-4 per kg. But on Tuesday it was much higher than that, said market experts.

For young parents, this reality comes with the challenge of balancing a 10-hour job schedule, managing hyperactive kids and basic home chores.“I had initially thought it would be fun. But staying at home and working remotely for the last few days has taught me a lifetime lesson. First, in the absence of maid, I need to help in the daily chores and then comes the kid who seeks attention almost always and with that, comes the real challenge of meeting the work deadlines and the conference calls keeping out the distractions around. It’s a tough life. I am just waiting for my office to reopen and rush back to my cozy cubicle,” said Satarupa Chakraborty, who works at a top accounting and consulting MNC.Jadavpur resident and techie Soumya Bandyopadhyay said he hated to handover digital screens to his son, but such is the situation with both he and his wife working from home, often he has no other option to keep the child engaged. “I have done work from home on several occasions before. But this time, with the schools closed and the child stuck at home, it has become a major issue. I am trying to make him read as much books as possible but at times, I have no other way than to hand him over the tablet,” said Bandyopadhyay.A web graphic artist from Baguiati said such is the situation that he had to lock himself in the balcony of their 2BHK flat on Tuesday for three hours to finish an assignment even as his three-year-old daughter kept banging the door, pleading to allow her watch rhymes on his laptop. “I am feeling crazy at times and am also losing my cool. I know I shouldn’t but I can’t help,” the designer said.Doctors and psychologists said it’s a situation Indians are not very used to and is an extremely challenging situation for all the family members, including the elderly and the children. “Staying for two days at home with all the family members is a different ball game but to stay back for an indefinite period is a pressure cooker kind of situation. In a scenario like this, one has to accept the situation. It has to be clearly discussed with all the family members and ask everyone to keep calm. Everyone should have their own pursuits at home. Also, the positive aspect is, a family can come together and solve much of their existing problems during this period,” said Siladitya Roy, clinical psychiatrist.Neuro psychiatrist Baidyanath Ghosh Dastidar said: “The outbreak can be stressful for people. Fear and anxiety about a disease, coupled with people working from home with the entire family locked together at home, can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions in adults and children. Take care of yourself and follow normal routine, eat well, exercise regularly, have six to eight hours of sleep and avoid alcohol or sedatives.” Dastidar has even opened a 24x7 helpline number (9830177145) asking people to speak to him and his colleagues to seek free counselling on coping with the situation.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74804278,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-689268,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/work-from-home-tough-to-handle-find-young-parents/articleshow/74800341.cms

406,['25/03/2020'],"Despite night shelters, homeless forced to sleep on footpaths","Nagpur: Noor suddenly found himself helpless from last Sunday when the road, which had become his home, was deserted after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s janata curfew call. The mentally deranged man, who strayed on the road outside Laxminarayan Institute of Technology (LIT) for nearly a year, used to feel at home on the footpath.

Barely able to tell his name, Noor had became a known face for street vendors who not only provided him with food, clothing but also arranged a bedding for him at the footpath. However, things changed after the lockdown was extended.

Since Sunday, a puzzled Noor was seen spending his time alone, hoping for his friends to help. Many such homeless persons like him would be seen spending their lives on the footpath at Khamla Square, Sitabuldi, Alankar Square and other places. Ironically, the pavement dwellers continue to be on road despite nearly half of beds at the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC)-operated five shelters for homeless remaining vacant.

As per NMC officials, only 112 beds are occupied at all the five shelter homes, which means 108 are still vacant.

Some NGOs, however, complained that these shelter homes allow entry only for men while families were prohibited, which was precisely the reason these migrants were seen wandering on roads with their wives and children.

“As the entire world is caught in the coronavirus pandemic, we’ve conducted an awareness drive related to the deadly disease at three places — University Library Square, Yeshwant Stadium and Santra Market — where such families usually stay,” Kiran Kalantari, a member of a city-based NGO Upay, which has been working for homeless kids for the last many years, told TOI.

A group of 10 to 15 families, staying near University Library Square earns livelihood by selling home decoration items. The NGO’s help came as a timely boon for them, as they had lost their only source of income after the lockdown was imposed. “The NGO members are helping us out by not only providing food for at least three days, but also supplying liquid soaps and masks to all of us,” said Shankar Chakar, one of the pavement dwellers.

Kalantari said Upay was in touch with many other NGOs for providing ration and other daily needs products to the homeless people in the city.

In a communiqué, the NMC directed its officials to provide free food to the shelter home inmates. Moreover, if any of them was found with symptoms like cough, cold, fever and difficulty in breathing, they should be provided with proper medication and sent to the testing centres if the condition is serious.

“The inmates have already been guided on how to maintain hygiene and wash hands with soap at regular intervals to protect themselves from contracting the disease. Masks have also been distributed after apprising them of its importance,” the communiqué informed.

416,['25/03/2020'],India Lockdown for 21 days: All of India under lockdown for 3 weeks due to Coronavirus in India,"More on Covid-19

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday ramped up the fight against coronavirus by announcing that the entire country was being placed under lockdown — he called it as good as curfew — for 21 days starting midnight in order to break the chain of Covid-19 transmission and save India from a massive outbreak that could overwhelm the healthcare system.Saying there was no other way to save the country from coronavirus, the PM said nations were facing a growing challenge and even the health care systems of developed countries like the US and Italy were struggling to respond to the unprecedented situation resulting from the rapid global spread of Covid-19.“At 12 midnight... listen carefully, at 12 midnight, all of India will be under total lockdown. This is being done keeping in mind the experiences of other nations. This is the only way to save India. Save you and your families. No one steps out of their house. No one steps out. All states, all districts, all mohallas, will be locked down. It is a curfew. It is much more than a janata curfew. It is tougher. It is a decisive fight. It will indeed come at an economic cost but every life is important,” the PM said in a televised address, his second on coronavirus in a week. Drawing what he called the “lakshman rekha” for people, Modi bluntly said, “Forget about venturing out. For the next 21 days, you have to do just one thing, stay put at home, stay put at home and stay put at home only.You don’t have to take a single step beyond the ‘lakshman rekha’.” Modi acknowledged that the country would have a huge economic cost to pay, and that the poor would suffer the most. But he suggested it was time for the nation to choose its priorities and, clearly, saving people’s lives took precedence.“Jaan hai to jahan hai (If there is life, there is the world)... We must strengthen our resolve at every step and also be restrained,” he said. He added, “Come what may, you have to observe social distancing. From the common man in villages to the Prime Minister, nobody should breach this lakshman rekha.”As reports came in of panic buying after his speech, Modi tweeted, “By converging around shops, you are risking the spread of Covid-19. No panic buying please. Please stay indoors. I repeat— Centre and state governments will ensure all essentials are available.”The 21-day lockdown is arguably the first measure taken by any country to deal with the threat and Modi, like his address on Thursday, minced no words in underlining the gravity of the challenge facing the country and even people, citing the opinion of WHO and public health experts that a 21-day lockdown could break the chain of transmission, and by pointing to the tragic experience of developed countries reeling under the global pandemic.“Even the most capable nations have been rendered helpless. Not that they do not have resources or are not making efforts. But the virus is spreading so fast that despite efforts, these nations are facing a mounting challenge,” he said.However, he suggested that India could still find a way out of the crisis by exercising social distancing. “India is at the stage where our actions will decide the extent to which we can mitigate the crisis. We have to renew our resolve. This is the moment to exercise restraint and maintain discipline. We will come out victorious if we maintained utmost restraint,” the PM said. “There is only way one way to effectively combat this disease. It is social distancing. That means we have to stay away from each other. Stay indoors. There is no other way to save yourselves, your families and friends from coronavirus,” he added. Modi said there were misconceptions that social distancing was only for patients.“That is not correct. Social distancing is for everyone, for every person, including thePM.” The unprecedented step of placing the entire nation under lockdown comes days after more than 500 districts were put under such restrictions. There is a list of exempt services such as healthcare workers, media, sanitation staff and police that the PM mentioned, but he plainly suggested that implementation would be rigorous. “Treat your doorstep as your ‘lakshman rekha’ that you will not cross for the next three weeks,” he said.Hinting at the lack of seriousness with which lockdowns and restrictions have been observed, the PM said, “The carelessness and wrong thinking of some people could endanger yourselves, your families, friends and finally the nation will be in a big trouble. If such carelessness continues, India will have to pay a heavy price of which is not even possible to estimate.” While the rules about how the lockdown was to be observed and exemptions were notified by the home ministry, crowds were seen at grocery and convenience stores.The PM appealed to people to keep in mind the sacrifices being made by healthcare professionals, sanitation workers, media personnel engaged in reporting the situation without caring for their own safety and the police that was sometimes having to deal with unruly public. “I am appealing with folded hands, whereever you are, stay there. It will be for three weeks. I had said recently when I spoke to you that I am asking for a few weeks... To break the cycle, we will need 21 days. If we don’t control this, the country and your families will go back 21 years. Many families will be destroyed forever. I am speaking, not as a PM but as a member of your family. So forget what it is to step out,” PM said. He reminded people that the illness could be deceptive, and in the early stage of infection there was nothing to distinguish that coronavirus had struck.“Many times a person is quite healthy. No evidence of illness is apparent. This is need to stay alert,” he said and held up a sign doing the rounds on social media which said no one should come out on the roads in Hindi, spelling out“Co-ro-na”. The PM pointed that the number of infected persons had climbed steeply. It had taken 67 days to reach 100,000 people, 11 days to add another lakh and the third lakh came in only four days. The experience of countries that beat back the threat was that citizens needed to remain indoors. “Follow the directives of the central and state governments 100%. We are not to step out of homes. Come what may, from the PM to villager. Only then we can save ourselves,” he said.Modi said steps would be taken to ensure supply of essential materials and the problems of the poor would be attended to. “The highest priority will be given to repairing health facilities and working with WHO and Indian institutions. Efforts will be made to ensure we have ICUs, ventilators, beds, medical and paramedical staff.” He said that wittingly or unwittingly, rumours get around and asked people not to believe in them. He particularly asked people not to indulge in self-medication. “A 21 day lockdown is a long time but it is for all of you, for your safety, it is important that every Indian face this successfully.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74801599,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-333657,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-lockdown-for-21-days-all-of-india-under-lockdown-for-3-weeks-due-to-coronavirus-in-india/articleshow/74801459.cms

SURAT: Over the past two days, the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) has delivered vegetables, groceries, and fruits to the homes of 800 residents in various parts of Surat. The strict implementation of the lockdown has spiked online orders.

Two days ago, the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) had tied up with the APMC for home deliveries to prevent residents from leaving their homes. Surat reported its first death due to COVID-19 on March 22.

Talking with TOI, the secretary of the APMC, Nilesh Thorat, said: “The response to the online delivery service is overwhelming.” Customers place their orders on the APMC website. “We deliver the orders within half-an-hour,” Thorat said.

“We have a team of 30 delivery persons,” Thorat said. “The majority of the orders are coming from posh areas including Vesu, Parle Point, Athwalines, Adajan, and Pal.”

Thorat said customers must place an order of at least Rs 500. “We are not taking a single penny extra from customers,” Thorat said. “Our vegetable and fruit prices are lower than wholesale rates.”

The director of the APMC, Babu Shaikh, said: “We will continue online deliveries till March 31. On average, we are catering to about 400 people in the city a day.”

Deputy municipal commissioner (health and hospitals), Dr Ashish Naik said, “When people are getting their essential supplies delivered home, there is no need for them step out of their homes and risk their lives.”

However, to ensure only those involved in essential services are allowed to travel, DTC has now made it mandatory for all passengers to show identity cards. An order in this regard was issued by DTC managing director on Tuesday.“This was necessary as even those who were not involved in essential services were roaming around in buses, putting other passengers and our staff in danger,” an official from DTC said.“Our buses are being thoroughly sanitised, but with unnecessary crowding, maintaining social distancing becomes difficult,” he added.“With more DTC buses in place, vehicles were comparatively less crowded today. The situation will improve on Wednesday with only those with official identity cards allowed to board buses,” he asserted.While barring all types of public transport from operating on Sunday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had allowed only 25% buses of the DTC fleet to operate from Monday. Due to the overcrowding witnessed on the first day of the lockdown, DTC was asked to operate 50% of its fleet.

KOLAR: With the threat of Covid-19 spreading to rural pockets running high, 800 residents of a village on the Karnataka-Andhra border have initiated extreme measures: Cutting contact with the outside world for two months by sealing all roads leading to the village.

M Golahalli, 110km from Bengaluru and in Kolar district, took this decision as residents don’t want any of them to get infected and spread it to others. The village has mainly agricultural workers who depend on farms for their livelihood.

According to M Gopal, a progressive farmer and national secretary of All India Kissan Manch in the village, the villagers are unanimous in their decision and 100 volunteers will oversee the arrangements. There are four committees on health, sanitation, security and communication. Checkposts have been set up to prevent entry or exit of any person.

KV Jagganath, president, district Primary School Teachers Association, said villagers will keep vigil at these checkposts. He said over 700 litres of milk is being produced in the village every day and this will be filled in cans and be placed outside the border and vans that collects milk should lift the cans from the border itself. The excess vegetables would be placed in boxes after subjecting them to sanitisation and would be placed outside the border.

N Rajgopal, former ZP member said: “In a bid to prevent shortage of groceries and other food stuff, villagers were asked to get required groceries and other items which can last long for two months, including medicine. All those who have gone out of the village have been asked to come back. There are four temples in the village and rituals are being allowed. This morning, villagers swept the village and sanitised the roads using cow dung and cow urine. The villagers decided to clean their village regularly. This self-isolation will be in place for two months.”

In case the situation eases, farmers will rethink the period of isolation. Interestingly, a young man from the village who lives in London as been asked by villagers not to return till this crisis is over.

Even coaching centres have shut operations. Nearly one crore students are limited to their homes for almost a week now, and there’s every possibility of the lockdown being extended. Several busy academic centres in the state, including Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, Tirupati, Rajahmundry, Kakinada, Guntur and Anantapur have been witnessing muted activity due to the closure of colleges, schools, universities and hostels.

Other than international students, most universities have vacated students from hostels. Some varsities have also postponed practical examinations. Meanwhile, thousands of teachers and faculty members have also been voluntarily observing self isolation due to the ‘lockdown holidays’.

Prof M Jagannadha Rao, vice-chancellor of Adikavi Nannaya University, has asked students to limit themselves to their homes and refrain from going to crowded places during the lockdown period. “We have already postponed the exams. We have conducted various awareness programmes for students on the prevention of the pandemic,” he told TOI.

Andhra University registrar Prof V Krishnamohan, dean (international affairs) Prof Dhanamjaya Rao and Dr Paul Douglas (chief warden of AU international hostels) have been visiting the hostels housing international students and reviewing measures being taken there in view of the prevalence of the pandemic.

Prof Dhanamjaya Rao said they interacted with international students residing in the hostels. “All students expressed satisfaction regarding the sanitary and hygienic conditions there. We have requested them to follow the self-imposed curfew for a few more days,” said professor Rao.

M Ravikrishna Kumar, a maths lecturer at a corporate college in the city, said his college has asked faculty members too to remain at their homes. “Students attended college even during cyclones and heavy rains. But for the first time, all faculty members have got holidays for an extended period due to Covid-19,” he said.

The state government is of the view that the appointment of Sanchaita should be looked from a broader constitutional perspective. At a time when a constitutional debate is going on the issue of gender bias in case of whether or not to allow women into Sabarimala temple, the present appointment need to be looked in broader perspective.

They argued that in view of the Covid-19 outbreak and consequent lockdown imposed by the state government, they could not submit their grievances in time.

The state government opposed the interim application as it was moved on the last day of the time period given by the CRDA. Ample time was given to submit grievances and the lockdown came only two days ago, said the counsel for the government.

The high court considered the request of the petitioners in view of the prevailing situation and allowed the interim application by granting two weeks to submit grievances.

PUNE: City-based molecular diagnostics company Mylab Discovery Solutions and Germany’s Altona Diagnostics have been approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to make diagnostics kits to test people for Covid-19.The two companies received approval to mass manufacture the kits after they received commercial approval from Indian FDA/ Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO).“ICMR NIV Pune has completed evaluation of nine non-US FDA EUA/CE IVD kits. Only test kits with 100% concordance among true positive and true negative samples have been recommended for commercial use in India,” the council said in a statement.Currently, the probes required for testing a patient for Covid-19 are procured from the USA and these kits will continued to be used after due approval from Drug and Controller General of India (DCGI) and intimation to ICMR.“Even early stage infection can be detected with highest accuracy as has been seen during tests at ICMR,” Shailendra Kawade, executive director of Mylab, said in a statement.For the government labs, it would cost nearly Rs 1,200 per test kit, about one-fourth of what ICMR pays, and the terms are still being worked out for private labs, he added.“The support and immediate action from regulatory bodies (CDSCO/FDA), evaluation centre of ICMR, NIV, Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) and the central and state governments is commendable,” Hasmukh Rawal, managing director, Mylab Discovery Solutions, said.Altona Diagnostics could not be reached for its comment.The company set up a diagnostics centre in Germany in February 2020.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74802392,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-97894,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-lab-gets-approval-to-make-1l-diagnostic-kits-for-covid-19/articleshow/74801860.cms

MUMBAI: “There is only one message I would like to give senior citizens and those battling coronavirus: With good care and patience, you will fight and come out of it,” said a 70-year-old Andheri resident who was discharged on Tuesday after nearly 14 days of treatment. The septuagenarian and his 68-year-old wife, also called Mumbai’s index patients, had tested positive on March 11 following their return from a Dubai and Abu Dhabi trip.

They were among the eight patients to be discharged from the civic-run Kurla Bhabha Hospital on Tuesday evening. After being initially treated at Kasturba Hospital in Chinchpokli— the city’s nodal isolation centre—some were shifted to the Kurla hospital last week after two of their consecutive test reports came negative. Among those who went home was a threeyear-old girl from Kalyan, whose parents continue to be hospitalized, and a 62-year-old Kamothe man.

‘Kasturba doctors are masters’

A 49-year-old US-returned Ghatkopar resident and his 68-year-old domestic help were discharged too.

The three-year-old Kalyan girl’s father, who had tested positive after returning from the US, is currently serious and under treatment at Jaslok Hospital.

Speaking to TOI, the Kamothe resident said, “I was among the luckier ones who didn’t get very severe symptoms. I hardly had any fever or cough. After my initial report came positive, all the three subsequent ones were negative.” He said he was happy to go home but apprehensive about how people in the locality would behave around him.

“My wife and sons had a tough time after news got out that I was positive. I even got a phone call from a neighbour who said his tenants had vacated the house after learning of the infection,” he said. “I hope as people become more aware they understand that it’s just a flu and people recover from it,” he said, adding he was moved out of Kasturba on Sunday along with two others. “People should not step out of their homes and maintain social distancing,” he said. His wife, son and daughter-inlaw, too, are nearing the end of their home quarantine period.

The Andheri couple—Mumbai’s index patients—said they were relieved to be home after all. “Fear and anxiety is there because it’s a new disease, but Kasturba doctors are masters. They know their job. No disease is painless but, of course, multiple jabs through the day for blood tests were no fun,” he said, adding his wife was still battling a stomach bug, but she would be fine now that they were home.

While they were happy to head home, the lockdown posed a hindrance for some. The son of the 68-year-old domestic help said, “Our home is located far from the hospital and now with a complete lockdown in the city, I am unsure of how to bring her back home as public transportation has shut.” He has only spoken to his mother over phone since she was admitted on March 11.

Explaining why the BMC did not wait for 14 days to discharge patients, as was the protocol followed across the country, additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said all these patients had tested negative for the virus. “Once that happened, we didn’t want them to stay very close to positive patients or even on the same premises. Also, a team of doctors was formed to see if any of them had other ailments before they were discharged,” he said.

MUMBAI: With suburban and long-distance train services suspended from March 23-31 to curb the spread of Coronavirus, the Mumbai division of Central Railway (CR) and Western Railway (WR) is staring at cumulative losses of over Rs 220 crore.

A CR official said, “We have an average daily earning of Rs 2.50 crore from the suburban network, Rs 6.50 crore from mail/express trains and Rs 5 crore from freight trains.”

CR runs a total of 1,774 suburban services daily, around 80 mail/express trains and 20 freight trains in Mumbai division.

A CR official said, “Freight trains are being run, but while there were 20 goods trains daily, now only four to five trains are leaving as there is no movement of goods by road to freight terminals with the workforce home due to the lockdown.”

Similarly, WR is facing a daily loss of Rs 8 crore, including over Rs 2 crore from the suburban system in Mumbai division. A WR official said, “The losses do not include the refunds to the tune of Rs 3 crore that we have released for train cancellations.”

Meanwhile, Indian Railways is working 24/7 to ensure uninterrupted supply of essential commodities across the nation. Across Indian Railway, on March 23, a total of 474 rakes were loaded with essential commodities like foodgrains, salt, edible oil, sugar, milk, fruits, vegetables, onion, coal and petroleum products.

‘This Ugadi is special ’cos my first performance with my daughter Viya will be telecast on TV’

‘For the first time ever I’ll actually get to watch my ‘Ugadi specials’ on TV’

‘We’ll make Ugadi special this year with our hearts’

‘I’m going to miss the Ugadi pachadi, but spending time at home with my dad is the best way to start

‘I’m looking forward to cooking a meal with my mother this Ugadi’

‘Celebrating Ugadi under quarantine brings back memories of Bigg Boss’

‘Let’s forget the rituals and focus on the spirit of the new year this Ugadi’

With six ingredients — raw mangoes, jaggery, tamarind, neem flowers, chillies, salt — that bring in six varied tastes, Ugadi pachadi is a metaphor for life itself. For, what’s life if not bitter-sweet? (Okay, and spicy-tangy-salty as well!) And this Ugadi, that truth has come alive for countless Telugus. As we stand on the threshold of yet another new year, with the fear of COVID-19 looming large, and changing the very world as we knew it, everyone is taking a moment to mull over it all. And all that reflection has only made everyone a lil’ more grateful for the small joys of life. As we enter another new year, our favourite celebrities, who’ve confessedly been too busy to spend festivals at home, tell us what they’re thankful for, how are they are ushering in their new year, and why staying at home with your loved ones is the best way to celebrate Ugadi.We’ve never managed to have a big celebration at home on Ugadi day. All these years, Ugadi has been about my mum making the pachadi in the morning which I have a spoonful of before rushing off for training with my dad. But this Ugadi is different because finally I get to stay at home the whole day. On the agenda is just a lot of chilling and watching TV. I will also work on my fitness and practise on my make-shift badminton court on the terrace. So it’s a special Ugadi alright, since I willbe home with family. But we’ll all be 7-ft apart (laughs). Let’s all pledge to stay home and stay safe.— PV Sindhu, badminton playerEvery Ugadi, I’m under house arrest because my family never lets me go anywhere (laughs). So this Ugadi is no different in that sense. Jokes apart, this year, it’s all the more important that we all stay home because public safety is paramount and there can be no excuse to go out. What better way to start your new year than spending it with your loved ones? Personally, this Ugadi will be special for me because I performed on stage with my four-year-old daughter, Viya. This is the first time we performed together and it will be telecast today at 11:30 am. So in the morning, my mom and wife will make the Ugadi pachadi, after relishing it, we will all sit in front of the TV to watch Viya and me in action. I can’t wait!— Ravi, TV anchorI live with my brother, so it’s just the two of us celebrating Ugadi this year. I’ll be missing out on the Ugadi pachadi because I’m too scared to go outside to get the ingredients to make it. Instead, we’ll be staying home, cleaning the house, washing hands and of course, video-calling our parents. But it’s not all gloomy. Some of my Ugadi specials on television, which were shot a while ago, will be aired today. So for once, I’ll actually get the chance to watch my show on TV rather than watch it on OTT platforms a few days later. I’m grateful to be home with my brother at this time. I hope this crisis is averted soon and that we all have a wonderful year ahead.— Sreemukhi, TV starIt’s just me and my father here in Hyderabad this Ugadi as most of my family is in Ireland. We’re in quarantine and won’t have the usual celebration we have with family every year, but we will have a pooja. This year, our Ugadi is filled with hope to beat corona. We don’t know how to make the Ugadi pachadi, eppudu tinna amma chetide. We have also asked our cook not to come so we will be cooking for ourselves tomorrow too. We don’t know how to cook any festive dishes, so we will makethe festival special with our hearts. And, of course, we will video-call everyone else in the family so we do not miss them too much. Adivi Sesh , actorI will be spending Ugadi at home after a long time. In a way, I think it’s nice that we are all getting a chance to spend time doing nothing other than bonding with loved ones. I think this is a great way to usher in the new year. Ugadi meant going to the temple and visiting cousins. This time it’s going to be different. This Ugadi, it’s just my dad and me at home. we plan to binge watch TV (laughs). I have two sisters — one is in London and the other, in Bengaluru. I’ve been video-calling them every two hours. In fact, because we’re all under self-quarantine, we’re talking more than ever before. This crisis has brought us all closer. The only thing I’m going to miss is the Ugadi pachadi. Because of the long queues, we were unable to buy the ingredients needed to make it. We will make it special someother way though. Eesha Rebba , actressEveryday feels like Ugadi as I’ve been home with my parents. It’s been a while since I’ve spent so much time with them. We’ve been watching movies. Usually on Ugadi day, we have a small get- together. This time, it’s just the three of us. To start with, I’ve been assigned the task of cleaning my room so that’s how I’ll start my day (laughs). Cooking will be next but I am not revealing what’s on the menu. Yes, the pachadi will be there. But what I’m looking forward to the most is playing carrom with them. I found my old carrom board, and we decided to play together. It’s the little things that give you joy. I feel blessed to just be home with family at a difficult time like this. Pradeep Machiraju , TV anchorI stay with my extended family, including my two babayyas and their families. So, this Ugadi is nodifferent for us because we’re all in isolation together. What’s different however, is the fact that every year I have to make it back home despite shoots and sometimes I can’t because I’m in a different state or country all together. But this year, we have been all been spending time together and it’s been wonderful. Can’t wait for Ugadi specials like pulihora mavudkai pachadi , playing games with cousins.– Naga Shaurya , actorThis is a difficult time for all of us all over the world, but it gives us an opportunity to spend Ugadi at home with our loved ones. This year, Ugadi will be a low-key affair and considering we can’t really step out to buy ingredients. My mum and I will be cooking together, so that’s going to be fun. We plan to make a simple meal that includes dal-chawal, aloo fry and soup. Also, given that the stray animals don’t have food to eat, I’ll be doing my bit to feed them too. In our culture, celebrating afestival means being with family. I am just grateful that we have each other in our lives. Rashmi Gautam , TV anchorBeing under quarantine makes me feel like I’m back in the Bigg Boss house all over again. My family members are telling me that they now realise what it was like for me when I was in the house. Jokes apart, Ugadi for us, is usually a fun affair with numerous delicacies, meeting extended family, roaming the roads with friends and chilling endlessly. However, this year it’ll just be me with my parents and sister. The usual bellam annam, pulihora and bobbatlu will be there, but I’m not surewe’ll have the Ugadi pacchadi due to the lockdown. But unlike in the Bigg Boss house, at least we have access to phones, so I’ll be video-calling my cousins. Small mercies!– Roll Rida, rapperThe COVID-19 pandemic has given us all an opportunity to pause, reflect and re-evaluate our lives. On Ugadi, there are no big celebrations for me every year, but a constant fixture is the Ugadi pachadi. This time, however, I don’t think we’ll be able to buy raw mangoes, etc., to make it at home. But I think we should all take this as an opportunity to focus on the spirit of the new year rather than sulking about the rituals we can’t follow.

452,['25/03/2020'],CM writes to PM for raising FRBM limit,"Kolkata: Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to allow states to go for more borrowing by relaxing the fiscal discipline under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budgetary Management (FRBM) Act in view of the “near catastrophic fiscal parameters” of state following the COVID 19 lock down.

“You would agree that the acutely necessary lock downs and closure of business in many states including our own will severely cripple resource mobilisation by states. There is no doubt that the GST collection will plummet when GST constitutes 70% of the state’s tax collection,” the Bengal said in her letter to PM.

Mamata in her letter also pointed out that the fall in tax collection would adversely hit the Centre’s tax pool and in turn reduce devolution of tax to states.

The Bengal CM urged the PM to raise FRBM limit of fiscal deficit from 3% of the state GDP to 5% that will give states an elbow room to grapple with the “growth-recession.” The Bengal legislature will pass the amendment once the Centre makes the change in the FRBM limit, the CM said.

The FRBM Bill was introduced in Parliament in 2000 by the then finance minister Yashwant Sinha. The Bill was approved by the Union Cabinet in 2003 and became effective from July 5, 2004. The purpose of the FRBM Act was to enforce fiscal discipline in both the Centre and the state with an aim to bring down the burgeoning fiscal deficit to 3% of the GDP. Accordingly, the states passed similar legislation to follow the principle in their state Budgets.

The Bengal CM’s appeal to relax the fiscal deficit cap at 3% comes after the week-long lock down in the state following the outbreak of COVID 19 resulting in scaling down of the economy. The CM fears that this will affect tax mobilisation. Bengal has been grappling with the debt burden left behind by the Left Front regime. The Mamata Banerjee government has been raising crucial capital expenditure, expenditure in the social sector despite the outgo of Rs 50,000 crore as capital and interest repayment of debt through better tax management and also by expanding the tax net. The CM fears that Bengal also other states won’t be able to keep up with the pace for the 2020-21 financial.

KOLKATA: At 5pm last Sunday, millions of Indians clapped, rang bells and blew conch shells to laud the efforts of doctors and health workers in the frontline of the war against the coronavirus . A day and a half later, three nurses in Kolkata faced a more personal battle — one against prejudice and social ostracization. They were told in no uncertain terms to vacate their rented accommodation just because they were employees of the hospital where a Covid-19 patient died on Monday.“My landlord, accompanied by some locals from the neighbourhood, came knocking on the doors of my PG accommodation on Tuesday morning and asked me to leave,” said one of the male nurses, who shares the flat with two other colleagues of the private hospital in Salt Lake. The turn of events shocked the trio as everything was fine with the neighbourhood till Sunday. Many locals had even sought their help on different occasion. But the mood changed dramatically when the news of the death of the 57-year-old Covid-19 patient spread like wildfire.“I explained that none of us was involved in the treatment of the particular patient, but they would have none of it. They argued that since we work in a hospital where a Covid-19 patient was treated we should leave and not return to the locality. They made us feel as if we had committed a crime,” the male nurse told TOI.The three colleagues have informed the hospital management about their ordeal and the authorities have assured them of alternative accommodation. The hospital, in fact, had isolated 15 healthcare workers, including six doctors, who were involved in the treatment of the deceased patient. The swab samples of 11 were tested and the results were all negative.Another nurse at the same hospital said he had stopped sending his daughter to tuition classes after other students and their parents started asking her odd questions. “I do not want my daughter to go through the trauma of ostracization and so have decided not to send her to the tuition class for now,” he said.“I wasn’t part of the team taking care of the Covid-19 patient. But so what if I was part of that team? This is our duty and we do that after taking all precautions. One day you clap for us and the next day you shoo us away,” said another dismayed male nurse at the hospital.Another nurse with the Beliaghata ID hospital, the apex facility for Covid-19 in the state where all eight confirmed patients are currently undergoing treatment, was also asked to vacate her rented apartment near the hospital where she lives with her husband. She had gone to visit her native place in Kalyani a few days ago when the landlord called up and asked her not to return. She had to seek police intervention to return to the house.News of such social ostracism is pouring in from across the state and the country as the number of Covid-19 patients rise. In Behrampore, a doctor of Murshidabad Medical College and Hospital was evicted by his elderly landlord on Monday and had to be put up at a hospital facility by the authorities.In Kolkata, several medical students and doctors complained that last week many app-cab drivers had cancelled their rides once they realised that the pick-up address was the premises of a hospital.“We are risking our lives to stop the spread of the virus and treat suspected and confirmed cases. We will go on doing it come what may. I request our society to be with us and not ostracize us for doing our duty,” said Indrajit Malik, a post-graduate student at NRS Medical College and Hospital “It is absolutely shocking that a nurse has been asked to leave her rented house just because she works in ID Hospital? Our society needs to be more sensitive to healthcare providers, especially in such a time of crisis when healthcare providers are the frontline warriors,” said cardiothoracic and vascular surgeon Tapas Raychaudhury.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74804697,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-654866,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/frontline-healthcare-workers-face-ostracization-from-landlords/articleshow/74801408.cms

455,['25/03/2020'],"Ugadi: Let’s stay home, stay safe and count our blessings this Ugadi","With six ingredients — raw mangoes, jaggery, tamarind, neem flowers, chillies, salt — that bring in six varied tastes, Ugadi pachadi is a metaphor for life itself. For, what’s life if not bitter-sweet? (Okay, and spicy-tangy-salty as well!) And this Ugadi, that truth has come alive for countless Telugus. As we stand on the threshold of yet another new year, with the fear of COVID-19 looming large, and changing the very world as we knew it, everyone is taking a moment to mull over it all. And all that reflection has only made everyone a lil’ more grateful for the small joys of life. As we enter another new year, our favourite celebrities, who’ve confessedly been too busy to spend festivals at home, tell us what they’re thankful for, how are they are ushering in their new year, and why staying at home with your loved ones is the best way to celebrate Ugadi.We’ve never managed to have a big celebration at home on Ugadi day. All these years, Ugadi has been about my mum making the pachadi in the morning which I have a spoonful of before rushing off for training with my dad. But this Ugadi is different because finally I get to stay at home the whole day. On the agenda is just a lot of chilling and watching TV. I will also work on my fitness and practise on my make-shift badminton court on the terrace. So it’s a special Ugadi alright, since I willbe home with family. But we’ll all be 7-ft apart (laughs). Let’s all pledge to stay home and stay safe.— PV Sindhu, badminton playerEvery Ugadi, I’m under house arrest because my family never lets me go anywhere (laughs). So this Ugadi is no different in that sense. Jokes apart, this year, it’s all the more important that we all stay home because public safety is paramount and there can be no excuse to go out. What better way to start your new year than spending it with your loved ones? Personally, this Ugadi will be special for me because I performed on stage with my four-year-old daughter, Viya. This is the first time we performed together and it will be telecast today at 11:30 am. So in the morning, my mom and wife will make the Ugadi pachadi, after relishing it, we will all sit in front of the TV to watch Viya and me in action. I can’t wait!— Ravi, TV anchorI live with my brother, so it’s just the two of us celebrating Ugadi this year. I’ll be missing out on the Ugadi pachadi because I’m too scared to go outside to get the ingredients to make it. Instead, we’ll be staying home, cleaning the house, washing hands and of course, video-calling our parents. But it’s not all gloomy. Some of my Ugadi specials on television, which were shot a while ago, will be aired today. So for once, I’ll actually get the chance to watch my show on TV rather than watch it on OTT platforms a few days later. I’m grateful to be home with my brother at this time. I hope this crisis is averted soon and that we all have a wonderful year ahead.— Sreemukhi, TV starIt’s just me and my father here in Hyderabad this Ugadi as most of my family is in Ireland. We’re in quarantine and won’t have the usual celebration we have with family every year, but we will have a pooja. This year, our Ugadi is filled with hope to beat corona. We don’t know how to make the Ugadi pachadi, eppudu tinna amma chetide. We have also asked our cook not to come so we will be cooking for ourselves tomorrow too. We don’t know how to cook any festive dishes, so we will makethe festival special with our hearts. And, of course, we will video-call everyone else in the family so we do not miss them too much. Adivi Sesh , actorI will be spending Ugadi at home after a long time. In a way, I think it’s nice that we are all getting a chance to spend time doing nothing other than bonding with loved ones. I think this is a great way to usher in the new year. Ugadi meant going to the temple and visiting cousins. This time it’s going to be different. This Ugadi, it’s just my dad and me at home. we plan to binge watch TV (laughs). I have two sisters — one is in London and the other, in Bengaluru. I’ve been video-calling them every two hours. In fact, because we’re all under self-quarantine, we’re talking more than ever before. This crisis has brought us all closer. The only thing I’m going to miss is the Ugadi pachadi. Because of the long queues, we were unable to buy the ingredients needed to make it. We will make it special someother way though. Eesha Rebba , actressEveryday feels like Ugadi as I’ve been home with my parents. It’s been a while since I’ve spent so much time with them. We’ve been watching movies. Usually on Ugadi day, we have a small get- together. This time, it’s just the three of us. To start with, I’ve been assigned the task of cleaning my room so that’s how I’ll start my day (laughs). Cooking will be next but I am not revealing what’s on the menu. Yes, the pachadi will be there. But what I’m looking forward to the most is playing carrom with them. I found my old carrom board, and we decided to play together. It’s the little things that give you joy. I feel blessed to just be home with family at a difficult time like this. Pradeep Machiraju , TV anchorI stay with my extended family, including my two babayyas and their families. So, this Ugadi is nodifferent for us because we’re all in isolation together. What’s different however, is the fact that every year I have to make it back home despite shoots and sometimes I can’t because I’m in a different state or country all together. But this year, we have been all been spending time together and it’s been wonderful. Can’t wait for Ugadi specials like pulihora mavudkai pachadi , playing games with cousins.– Naga Shaurya , actorThis is a difficult time for all of us all over the world, but it gives us an opportunity to spend Ugadi at home with our loved ones. This year, Ugadi will be a low-key affair and considering we can’t really step out to buy ingredients. My mum and I will be cooking together, so that’s going to be fun. We plan to make a simple meal that includes dal-chawal, aloo fry and soup. Also, given that the stray animals don’t have food to eat, I’ll be doing my bit to feed them too. In our culture, celebrating afestival means being with family. I am just grateful that we have each other in our lives. Rashmi Gautam , TV anchorBeing under quarantine makes me feel like I’m back in the Bigg Boss house all over again. My family members are telling me that they now realise what it was like for me when I was in the house. Jokes apart, Ugadi for us, is usually a fun affair with numerous delicacies, meeting extended family, roaming the roads with friends and chilling endlessly. However, this year it’ll just be me with my parents and sister. The usual bellam annam, pulihora and bobbatlu will be there, but I’m not surewe’ll have the Ugadi pacchadi due to the lockdown. But unlike in the Bigg Boss house, at least we have access to phones, so I’ll be video-calling my cousins. Small mercies!– Roll Rida, rapperThe COVID-19 pandemic has given us all an opportunity to pause, reflect and re-evaluate our lives. On Ugadi, there are no big celebrations for me every year, but a constant fixture is the Ugadi pachadi. This time, however, I don’t think we’ll be able to buy raw mangoes, etc., to make it at home. But I think we should all take this as an opportunity to focus on the spirit of the new year rather than sulking about the rituals we can’t follow. A new year basically means we’re turning over a new page, and we can write whatever we want on it. Let us all emerge as better individuals from this crisis and start afresh.– Nandini Reddy, director",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74796659,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-87490/74796659.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/events/hyderabad/lets-stay-home-stay-safe-and-count-our-blessings-this-ugadi/articleshow/74796659.cms

Don’t crowd the shops. Maintain safe distance. Your hands shouldn’t touch others; your breath shouldn’t reach others. People should maintain safe distance while standing in a queue in shops and banks. Don’t play cricket on the streets.”Earlier in the day, Banerjee had extended both the geographical ambit and period of the lockdown to March 31. PM Modi’s address later stretched it — nationally — till April 14. On Sunday, the state government had clamped the “complete safety regulations” on the city and district municipal areas from March 25 to March 27.Banerjee also announced an assistance scheme — called ‘Prochestha’ — to address the problems faced by daily wage-earners who are facing a loss of income because of the lockdown. Under the scheme, if they apply to the government between April and April 30, they would be entitled to a monthly grant of Rs 1,000. Prior to this, the state government had decided to give free rations to a total of 7.9 crore people below the poverty line and students under the mid-day meal programme. Each family under this arrangement will get five kilos of rice and wheat a month.Both of the state’s new cases had a recent travel history abroad. The chief minister, during her address, advocated extreme caution because of the rise in Covid-19 cases, particularly those who carried the virus from abroad. Later, she paid a visit to Medical College Hospital , Kolkata, SSKM and RG Kar to take stock of the state’s preparedness in treating the victims.“The situation has reached alarming proportions,” Banerjee said. “We are at a crossroads. We were doing a case study that revealed that it took 67 days for the virus to affect one lakh people. The same number of people were affected in the next 11 days. And now, another one lakh people have been affected in only four days.... Many people have returned home. I appeal to them to stay in home isolation for 14 days. We need to take the virus seriously.

Bio-medical waste

CHANDIGARH: To tackle the coronavirus situation in the state, the Punjab government on Tuesday declared 16 hospitals in the state, having a capacity of 2,156 beds, as isolation facilities. Four rehabilitation centres with 250 beds have also been converted into isolation centres.The district administrations and authorities concerned have been directed to make these operational by March 25.So far, as many as 29 people have been tested positive for the virus while one has died. The positive cases are either family members of people coming from aboard or those they have come in contact with. Around 90,000 Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) residing in the most virus-hit nations have entered the state in last one month. As the virus is being largely transmitted by people coming from aboard, the state government fears that the number of positive cases will rise in coming days.These facilities will be set up at MCH wing of the Rajindra Hospital, Patiala (350 beds); Civil Hospital, Nawanshahr (50 beds); Civil hospital, Jalandhar (350 beds); Gain Sagar Hospital, Banur (350 beds); Advance Cancer Care Centre, Batinda (80 beds); Guru Nanak Dev Medical College, Amritsar (116 beds); district hospital, Ludhiana (100 beds); Super specialty block in Government Medical College, Patiala (250); Jalalabad Hospital (100 beds), eye department in district hospitals (50 beds), Ferozepur; rehabilitation centre, Muktsar (50 beds); rehabilitation centre, Kapurthala (100 beds); rehabilitation centre, Gurdaspur (50 beds); New Mother and Child Hospital , Pathankot (50 beds); district hospital, Hoshiarpur (75 beds); district hospital, Ropar (50 beds); rehabilitation centre, Barnala (50 beds); New Mother and Child Hospital, Tarn Taran (30 beds); GGS Medical College, Faridkot (100 beds); district hospital, Mansa (30 beds); and Community health centre, Bagha (25 beds) have been converted into isolation facilities equipped with trained health staff and adequate equipment.Principal health secretary Anurag Agarwal shared that a notification has been issued and treatment will be provided to all the patients free of cost. “These isolation centres will help the government in its fight against the virus,” said Agarwal, who added that these facilities are following the guidelines issued by the central government.Each bed, in these hospitals, is separated by 2-metre distance and all rooms have proper lighting, ventilation and other basic infrastructure. Only authorised and trained persons will be permitted to enter the quarantine areas and the doors of the rooms will be kept closed at all the times under surveillance of a guard.Civil surgeons and concerned senior medical officers will ensure setting up of proper sample drawing facility at all these facilities as per the laid-down standard operating procedures.Emphasis has been laid on collection of biomedical waste management as per the set guidelines. For ensuring proper collection of biomedical waste management in these facilities, separate yellow, red /black, foot operating dustbins have been kept at each floor and outside the facility. Instructions have been issued to ensure that doffing of infectious material is done in designated area and the bins are to be collected at least twice daily by biomedical waste management vehicle.

NEW DELHI: Amid concerns that panic buying of hydroxy-choloroquine may lead to shortage of the drug after the government allowed prophylactic use of the anti-malarial medicine for prevention of Covid-19 in high-risk cases only, All India Organisation of Chemists and Druggists (AIOCD) asked all its member retailers to keep a stringent check on prescriptions and not sell a dosage of more than 15-20 days per customer.

Separately, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) as well as some state drug authorities also issued advisories to pharma retailers and chemists to not sell hydroxy-choloroquine, chloroquine , as well as the anti-retroviral combination of lopinavir and ritonavir - approved for emergency treatment of Covid-19 - and related products to anyone without prescription of a registered doctor having an MD (Medicine) degree or a pulmonologist.

While manufacturers maintain there are adequate stocks of the drug as of now, India exports almost 80% of its production to countries like Africa as the drug is almost redundant for use in India.

On Monday, the health ministry issued an advisory allowing prophylactic use of hydroxy-chloroquine for prevention of Covid-19 in high-risk cases like healthcare workers involved in the care of Covid-19 patients, and asymptomatic household contacts taking care of such positive cases.

However, TOI spoke to several chemists who said people are randomly coming to buy the drug to avoid the infection .

MUMBAI: A total of 113 citizens, including four who were in home quarantine, were booked for violating prohibitory orders under section 188 (disobeying an order of a public servant) on Monday. These cases were registered in the light of the curfew order issued by the state to contain the spread of Covid-19. Apart from these cases, 35 others have been registered from March 18 to March 21. When booked under section 188, one can face a punishment of six months jail or a fine or both.

Four people who were stamped with ‘home-quarantine’ at the airport after arriving from Dubai were booked on Tuesday as well for disobeying quarantine instructions. Three of them had left the hotels they were asked to stay in and come to Wadala, where they were found. They were sent to forceful institutional quarantine, said deputy police commissioner (Port Zone) Rashmi Karandikar. A 62-year-old woman from Sanpada was also booked on Tuesday for violating home quarantine orders. Civic officials checked on her on Tuesday, and found that she had gone to Santacruz. She, along with three of her family members, were sent to Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation’s quarantine centre in Vashi.

The maximum number of people booked for an offence on Monday was 53. These were people found running shops selling non-essential commodities. Following these were hawkers (18 cases) and hotels (16 cases) that remained open despite the curfew declared by CM Uddhav Thackeray. Motorists out for non-emergency purposes were also caught after the curfew was announced.

“The 112 were booked under section 188 of Criminal Procedure Code. Among the 112, three were those who had returned from abroad and were stamped for home quarantine for 14 days. They were found roaming outside,” said city police spokesperson, deputy police commissioner Pranaya Ashok. The fourth citizen booked on Monday for violating home quarantine orders was a 24-year-old man from Nerul. The youth, who had returned from UK on March 18, had travelled to Dombivli. Authorities there were informed and he was quarantined in Dombivli itself.

Ashok said action was taken against hotels and other establishments for flouting lockdown rules, by police teams and civic ward officials. Police also said that people were violating orders despite instructions, and that strict action would be initiated if they continued to do so. Lockdown and curfew are in force in the state to contain the spread of coronavirus.

Four people who were stamped with ‘home-quarantine’ at the airport after arriving from Dubai were booked on Tuesday as well for disobeying quarantine instructions. Three of them had left the hotels they were asked to stay in and come to Wadala, where they were found. They were sent to forceful institutional quarantine, said deputy police commissioner (Port Zone) Rashmi Karandikar. A 62-year-old woman from Sanpada was also booked on Tuesday for violating home quarantine orders. Civic officials checked on her on Tuesday, and found that she had gone to Santacruz. She, along with three of her family members, were sent to Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation’s quarantine centre in Vashi.

The maximum number of people booked for an offence on Monday was 53. These were people found running shops selling non-essential commodities. Following these were hawkers (18 cases) and hotels (16 cases) that remained open despite the curfew declared by CM Uddhav Thackeray. Motorists out for non-emergency purposes were also caught after the curfew was announced.

“The 112 were booked under section 188 of Criminal Procedure Code. Among the 112, three were those who had returned from abroad and were stamped for home quarantine for 14 days. They were found roaming outside,” said city police spokesperson, deputy police commissioner Pranaya Ashok. The fourth citizen booked on Monday for violating home quarantine orders was a 24-year-old man from Nerul. The youth, who had returned from UK on March 18, had travelled to Dombivli. Authorities there were informed and he was quarantined in Dombivli itself.

Ashok said action was taken against hotels and other establishments for flouting lockdown rules, by police teams and civic ward officials. Police also said that people were violating orders despite instructions, and that strict action would be initiated if they continued to do so. Lockdown and curfew are in force in the state to contain the spread of coronavirus.

THANE: A Bangladeshi who had allegedly jumped bail after being convicted in a triple bomb blast case in the neighbouring country has been arrested from Thane. The convict, Mofazzal Hussain (42) —alias Mofa Ali Kazi alias Mafijul Kera Ali Mandal—was caught near the Cidco bus stop near Thane railway station on Thursday. He was currently staying in Turbhe village in Navi Mumbai where he took up odd jobs to earn a living, said Nitin Thakre, senior inspector of the Thane crime branch.

Hussain had been convicted for triple bomb blasts that had taken place inside a mosque in Bangladesh in 2002, said an official from the Thane crime branch. One person had died the explosions. He hailed from Khulna state of Bangladesh.

While two bombs had exploded, the third had exploded in Hussain’s hand due two which he sustained major wounds to the left hand. Subsequently, the limb had to be amputated. In 2004, Hussain was arrested and a court in Bangladesh convicted him and sentenced him for life.

“The same year, he was granted bail on medical grounds. Since then, he was absconding from Bangladesh,” Thakre told TOI.

He moved to another part of his country and assumed a different name, Mafizul Keraali Mandal, and eventually fled to India. Sub-inspector Datta Sarak said that he initially lived in West Bengal and often visited Mumbai and Navi Mumbai.

As he sneaked into the country without any valid travel documents, he has been charged under sections of the Indian Passport Act and the Foreign Nationals Act. A local magistrate has remanded Hussain in police custody till March 27, the police said.

The police said that Hussain has confessed to his involvement in the triple bomb blasts case that took place in the mosque in Bangladesh. The police said they have also verified the conviction order.

Sarak said that there were no no crimes against him in India. The police said that are also coordinating with the embassies in India to have Hussain repatriated to Bangladesh.

Yet in certain parts of the country, these soldiers of humanity are facing social stigma. Fresh reports from Kerala , Bengal and Karnataka highlight cases of discrimination against them.Health minister Harsh Vardhan too acknowledged the problem by posting a tweet on Tuesday. “I’m DEEPLY ANGUISHED to see reports pouring in from Delhi, Noida, Warangal, Chennai etc that DOCTORS & PARAMEDICS are being ostracised in residential complexes & societies. Landlords are threatening to evict them fearing #COVID2019 infection. Pls don’t panic!”In Kerala, three male nurses, who had voluntarily opted for duty at the isolation wards in a governement hospital in Kottayam , had to leave their rented accommodation after the landlord voiced his concern. Others in the neighbourhood were also not ready to rent out their homes. After the collector P K Sudheer Babu intervened, the hospital superintendent agreed to allot an unused quarter on the campus to them for two weeks.In Kolkata, it was a similar story for some nurses attached with hospitals where Covid-19 patients are either getting treated or have died. They too were asked to vacate their rooms by their landlords.A male nurse who shared a flat in Salt Lake with two other colleagues faced problems when the neighbours came to know of the death of a 57-year-old Covid-19 patient. Another nurse from the Infectious Diseases and Beliaghata General Hospital, the apex hospital for Covid-19 in the state, was asked to leave her rented apartment. A government doctor from the Murshidabad Medical College and Hospital (MMCH) was thrown out of his rented accommodation in Behrampore by the landlord on Monday.In Karnataka, three private medical colleges in Devanahalli, who had joined hands with the state government to provide quarantine facilities to suspected Covid-19 patients, are facing an acute shortage of housekeeping staff.

But for the last two days he did not get food as due to coronavirus spread the city had been under a lockdown and curfew.On coming to know about this, Narinder washed his hands and gave him his food to eat.Later, the video footage of his offering food went viral on the social media and people also started circulating the footage largely on social media and appreciated the kind gesture of the inspector.However, all are not lucky as this poor person. Sonu, a resident of Ghaziabad, was working at a meat shop in the booth market in Sector 46. Sonu said as the Covid-19 pandemic spread in the city, it was put under a lockdown and his shop was also shut, due to which he was facing starvation.Sonu further said he used to sleep outside the shop but now the cops were not allowing him to sleep outside the shop and besides, it is too small and he would not be able to sleep inside the shop. All temples and gurdwaras are also closed so he has been strugling to get food for the last one week. He said he reached his employer's house in Sector 29 on foot and took money from him for food, but the question is from where he would buy the food as all hotels, dhabas and restaurants are closed in the city. ""The administration should arrange shelter and food for people like me in city,"" Sonu said.",chandigarh,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74802045,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-618875,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-a-cop-and-a-good-samaritan/articleshow/74802025.cms
477,['25/03/2020'],Swwapnil Joshi: Marathi celebs to have low-key Gudi Padwa celebrations this year,"With Gudi Padwa today, the Marathi New Year begins. Traditionally, the celebrations involve hoisting a gudi, eating the sakharechya maal and gorging on puran polis. However, this time around, with the COVID-19 outbreak and the lockdown in Maharashtra, the New Year celebrations in Maharashtrian households are going to be low key. We asked some Marathi celebs about their plans for the day and here's what they had to say…Gudi Padwa symbolises new beginnings, new hopes and aspirations. I celebrate the festival since the time I used to stay in Pune and continue to do so even today. Looking at the current scenario, we need good vibes and positive energy. So, I’m going to celebrate this festival at home in a traditional way.We must respect the self-imposed lockdown we all are in as it is the need of the hour but at the same time we must celebrate the auspicious days that bring us cheer. We will celebrate Gudi Padwa in a small way.We need to understand the gravity of the situation and welcome the New Year. Our gudi will be a gudi of responsibility this time. A responsibility of staying healthy, and that will happen by staying indoors only. Let’s pray this time passes soon. Since it’s my grandfather’s 95th birthday as well, we will have a small celebration at home today, of course only with the family. I urge everyone to celebrate the day responsibly, by staying at home and not inviting anyone over.Gudhi Padwa is believed to ward off evil, invite prosperity and good luck into our homes. So this Padwa will be all about offering prayers for the entire country to ward off the evil of coronavirus. This year’s celebration is going to be indoors and minus any guests.We all crave for family time otherwise and wish to be at home on special occasions. Now that we have that time to spend with our loved ones, I am making the most of it daily. Gudi Padwa for me is about bonding with my family and that’s precisely what I plan to do today. It goes without saying that no one will be venturing out of the house and so, it’s going to be an intimate celebration for us.We have cancelled today’s celebration. It was a conscious decision of not celebrating anything in a situation like this. We will stay home and go on with our daily chores. Safety is most important right now.I’m in Baroda this year at my parents’ home. I was supposed to be in Mumbai with Abhishek for Gudi Padwa, but due to the lockdown in Maharahstra, I have cancelled that plan. So, we will have a small celebration at my parents’ place. I will wear my mother’s sari and help her make puranpolis. But going out or inviting guests over is a strict no!It’s a difficult time for everyone and so, there won’t be any big celebration in our house. We will just do the basic rituals and hoist a small gudi. No meetings, no going out. The real celebration will happen when all of us are out of this danger called the coronavirus outbreak.I am definitely not going to step out to meet people. It’s time we exercise social distancing and follow the government order to stay at home. I haven’t decided on celebrating Gudi Padwa yet because of the situation globally, but even if I do, it will be a very basic affair with my wife and kids.This year everybody is at home. So, we will hoist the gudi and have a small celebration at home. I might cook something special today, but beyond that, I think it’s important for all of us to stay home in these tough times.It’s going to be a very intimate Gudi Padwa this year. I plan to celebrate it just like a normal day, while being vigilant. We are not stepping out and no guests can come over either. I won’t be making any sweets either. But I will draw a rangoli, put up the gudi and wish everyone over the phone. We should all abide by the directives issued by authorities and have a safe and healthy Gudi Padwa.This time it is a virtual Gudi Padwa for me this time. I am at home in Mumbai and will miss being with my family in Pune. But I am making the most of social media and will connect with them virtually today and spend a virtual Gudi Padwa with them. I’ll also put up a gudi in my balcony, perform a small pooja and make some special food. I’ll pray for good health for all my loved ones and betterment of the world.Gudi Padwa is the beginning of the New Year for Maharashtrians. This year, the relevance is completely different. I hope that its arrival puts an end to the spread of the coronavirus and all the suffering that people are going through. I wish and pray for a year of positivity, good health and peace of mind. This Gudi Padwa, my family and I are going to pray for ourselves and the entire world as a family.Since we are all stressing on the importance of staying at home, we must not step out to even buy things like gaathi. Instead, we should use whatever is available at home and keep the celebration low-key. My gudi this year is going to be a gudi of health. Hopefully, we will be out of the coronavirus pandemic soon.Usually, we have friends and family meets on this day, but we are avoiding that this year. We will call our dear ones and wish them over the phone, but there will be no gatherings. We will have a small celebration at home with just those in the household present.Every Gudi Padwa, I go home to Sangli and celebrate with my family. But this time, I have cancelled my travel and will be at my house in Mumbai. I will cook for myself and connect over video call with my family. In the current scenario, exercising caution and being responsible is important than anything else.Gudi Padwa is one of the most special festivals for Maharashtrians, but this year it will be a low-key affair at home. We must follow directions issued by the authorities for the benefit of all. There will be no grandeur and we will prepare food with whatever grocery is available at home instead of going out and buying something.Any festival is about spending time with the ones you love and with the lockdown in the state, we are all getting to do that. It won’t be a grand celebration in any household, I am sure, because everyone understands the gravity of the COVID-19 outbreak. At home, we will prepare puranpolis and gorge on them.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74799840,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-4712907/74799840.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/marathi/movies/news/marathi-celebs-to-have-low-key-gudi-padwa-celebrations-this-year/articleshow/74799743.cms
478,['25/03/2020'],Michael Livett: ‘We will be fine’;Nobel winner sees hope in coronavirus stats,"What Levitt noticed about Covid-19 in China

More on Covid-19

Think that is just draconian China?

So, fact remains we can’t take it all that easy...

...But it doesn’t pay to panic

‘It will get worse before it gets better.” That is what experts widely seem to be agreed on. But how bad things will get? And how long before they start getting better? Stanford biophysicist and the 2013 chemistry Nobel winner Michael Levitt has stuck his neck out to say that the outbreak will not really be the horror story many are anticipating it will be. Of course, as LA Times says in a report, he does stress on the need to “control the panic”, but believes its trajectory is less fearsome than is popularly believed.The clue to predicting the Covid-19 trajectory for Levitt lies in the rate of daily increase. Around the last week of February, Levitt reportedly told China Daily News that the virus’ rate of growth had peaked. Further, he predicted that the number of confirmed cases in China would hit about 80,000. And that the disease would claim about 3,250 lives. As of March 24, around 2 pm, there were 81,558 cases in China and 3,281 deaths from Covid-19. As the chart shows, new cases are being identified at a slower rate.Levitt says similar turning points can be observed for other countries — even those without authoritarian clampdowns — although most countries hit by Covid-19 are still trying to bring down the number of daily new cases. South Korea is one of the countries Levitt cites to point to a decline in the number of daily new cases.The report says Levitt analysed data from 78 countries that have had more than 50 new cases every day and that he sees “signs of recovery” in many of them. “Numbers are still noisy, but there are clear signs of slowed growth,” he says However, he reminds that countries that have recovered from an initial outbreak must still prepare for a return of coronavirus. China is now facing new waves of infection coming in from “places where the virus is spreading out of control” and other countries would face the same problem, he says.For Levitt, the target for health systems has got to be “better early detection” — not just through testing but perhaps also with bodytemperature surveillance — and immediate social isolation. In fact, Levitt said he is for taking strong measures to fight the outbreak and believes that social distancing is a “critical” tool.On the whole, Levitt feels there is unnecessary panic due to an almost exclusive focus on the galloping number of cases. He says that the “virus can grow exponentially only when it is undetected and no one is acting to control it”. While other experts quoted by LA Times advocated a wait-andwatch policy, Levitt says as long as there are strong efforts to fight Covid-19, things should get back to normal. “The real situation is not as nearly as terrible as they make it out to be,” he said.(Source: LA Times, Johns Hopkins)",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74802751,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-84585,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/we-will-be-fine-nobel-winner-sees-hope-in-coronavirus-stats/articleshow/74802034.cms

480,['25/03/2020'],"After 2 arrests, pvt security agencies added to essential services list","Kolkata: The Bengal government on Tuesday stepped in to include private security guards in its list of essential services, which will be exempted from lockdown.

The Union home ministry notification, which came late on Tuesday, also exempted private security agencies from lockdown.

Several representations were made to the state pleading that the five lakh-odd private security personnel in Kolkata and two-lakh more across the state manning the hospitals, banks and other establishments be exempted from the lockdown.

On Tuesday, things turned for the worse when a security guard heading for work on CIT Road, was arrested by Beniapukur police and another person working for a bank was arrested by the Ballygunge police for defying the lockdown order.

Cops can arrest or detain any person under the lockdown laws and slap them with charges under section 188 IPC, which has a six-month prison term. Both the security officials were later released by police.

Satnam Singh Ahluwalia, general secretary, Central Association of Private Security Industry (CAPSI)’s West Bengal chapter, said: “We had flagged this problem to the state government. We had been trying to impress on the importance of including security personnel in the exemption list. We are grateful that our request has been considered and the fresh order issued on Tuesday,”

“The Bengal government has considered the private security services and conservancy services as Essential Services and has kept these services outside the scope of complete safety restrictions. This measure comes to the security and conservancy personnel as an acknowledgement of their roles in times of crisis,” said Debajit Choudhury, CMD, NIS Management Limited.

484,['25/03/2020'],Weight loss or fat loss? What it means and what you should know,"We all strive and work hard to reach our ideal body weight. However, losing weight should not be the only goal of your weight loss regimen. Your body weight is not only ruled by the amount of fat, but also muscle mass, bone mass and metabolism. This is where the difference between weight loss and fat loss lies. Your workout should work on losing the extra fat in your body.The body weight is a sum of your muscle mass, fat mass, body water and also bone mass. Losing weight can sometimes backfire if not supported with a proper diet. Crash diets and other shortcuts may lead to a loss in muscle mass instead of fat mass. It may show fast results in the beginning, but your weight will shoot right back up the moment you leave exercising.It is important that your workout adds muscle mass too. Too much body fat stores unwanted water and calories which makes you feel out of shape. However, some amount of fat is required for the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and provide a cushioning to internal organs. Be regular with your exercise and reduce the number of calories you consume to make sure you lose fat mass.If you do not substitute your workout with a proper diet or take to diets and shortcuts to lose weight, it can cause you to lose muscle mass instead of fat. Here are a few signs that you are losing muscle mass –· Regular workouts feel harder to complete· You feel sluggish throughout the day· Lower endurance· You have poor balance· You weight is stuck at one pointHere is how you can ensure that you do not lose out on the important muscle mass and get rid of only the fat in the body.It is important to maintain a proper diet when you have a regular workout routine. Eating less is not the answer. Instead, eat a balanced diet that gives the body enough nutrition to help muscles recover after your workout. If you do not eat well, you may lose muscle strength and eventually lose muscle mass as well.You must consume some form of protein in every meal. It’s easy to complete your protein intake with eggs for breakfast or meat, cottage cheese, nuts and seeds throughout the day. It is important that you replace the protein that your muscles lose every day.Do not cut on carbs completely. Instead, keep an eye on refined or processed carbs. You can substitute them with whole grains like ragi, bajra or jowar. Carbohydrates are your steady source of energy.High-intensity interval training offers better results instead of long cardio activities. They add to muscle mass. You can also try and add weight training to help you maintain muscle mass. It is necessary that you take a day’s rest from your workout to help your muscles time to rest and recover.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74797355,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-143580/74797355.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/weight-loss/weight-loss-or-fat-loss-what-it-means-and-what-you-should-know/articleshow/74797336.cms

GURUGRAM: Online grocery stores such as Milkbasket and Bigbasket have partially suspended their operations in the national capital region amidst the lockdown, leaving many residents stuck as their orders scheduled for Monday and Tuesday stood cancelled. The Chemists and Drug Association in the city also spoke about the problems faced in the transportation of medicines and that could impact supply in the coming days.

Big Basket completely stopped operations from Tuesday in Gurugram. The website stated, “We are not operational due to the restrictions imposed by the local authorities on the movement of goods in spite of clear guidelines provided by the central authorities to enable essential services.” It further stated that they are working with the authorities to resolve the issue.

Online grocer Milkbasket which also failed to deliver to several locations across NCR on Monday and Tuesday. According to sources, due to the restrictions imposed by the local police, they could only operate at 40% of their capacity in Gurugram on Monday and the figure was even lower in Noida. ""We will not be able to deliver any fresh milk in Gurugram, Noida and Hyderabad on Wednesday as well. However, we shall be able to deliver most orders for groceries,"" said the company in a statement issued for the customers.

Grofers also faced similar hurdles while delivering essential items.

This left many residents, who were expecting their orders to be delivered, in despair. “We are following the orders and staying home. But essential items are not being delivered which is likely to aggravate our problems in the coming days, if not resolved. As of now, I wear a mask and go out to buy stuff and even then, I do not get many essential items. Milk has been in shortage for the past couple of days as well,” said Rohit Motwani, a resident from Orchid Island, Sector 51.

Meanwhile, local chemists also accused the police of restricting their movement. ""We are already running low on medicine stocks, and now, if the medicines cannot be transported, we might as well have to shut shop,"" read the statement issued by the Chemist and Drug Association, Gurugram.

Many others had similar apprehensions and said that if the situation persists, it will be very difficult to stay indoors. Responding to several complaints, the district administration has decided to resolve the issue. “We have decided to issue passes to all those involved in the delivery of essential services to ensure their smooth operations,” said a district official.

However, that is only one aspect of the problem as many offline retailers are also facing issues in sourcing staples because the supply chain is interrupted at many points. “While the supplies were coming in smoothly till yesterday, we faced some issues in procurement today as the supply has been hit. We are making whatever arrangements we could to meet the demand,” said Rajesh, a store owner in Sector 55.

PANCHKULA: Police teams were deployed to maintain law and order at liquor vends in Panchkula, which received a few customers on Tuesday. No liquor vend is open in curfew-bound cities of Chandigarh and Mohali.

Soon after liquor vends opened, people started stocking up. A person buying a crate of whiskey said, ""This lockdown will be imposed for a long time and liquor is needed in such hard times.""

Police teams were deployed to prevent crowding and taverns were closed. People were excited at Haryana government's announcement that liquor vends would be opened on Monday. Police said the situation at all liquor vends was peaceful. On Monday, seven salespersons from three liquor vends were arrested for selling liquor without permission and allowing people to gather at one place.

On the other hand, many Panchkula residents were unhappy with the decision. R K Aggarwal, president, Panchkula Vikas Manch said, ""The government should not open liquor vends. This will create more problems in society and vends should be shut down with immediate effect.""

Deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Mohit Handa said, ""A total of 200 police personnel and 20 special checkposts were laid in Panchkula to maintain law and order. Anyone found violating the norms should be punished under the law. Residents must cooperate with the police at checkposts and during other duties.""

Borders of the district remained sealed all day and only people involved in the business of essential commodities were allowed to enter and exit the city. The lockdown was strictly imposed and followed, officials said.

Jenny was initially handed over to her walker Rajiv Yadav by her owner before he got admitted to a Greater Noida hospital after testing positive for Covid-19.And after Rajiv refused to keep the dog at home fearing spread of infection, members of People for Animals, Greater Noida, rescued her. The rescuers were promised a vacant sanitisation centre to house the dog in the morning, but refused in the afternoon. They have sanitised the dog and housed it in their shelter.“We reached out to the district administration, the chief veterinary officer, SPCA but nobody wanted to take the dog in, so we finally came back with it to our shelter and made separate and special arrangements for it. We have washed and sanitised it,” Kaveri Bhardwaj, People for Animals, Greater Noida, said.“While the canine itself may not be a carrier, his collar and accessories could be contaminated, so mass housing in any animal shelter too is not a possibility, we could house one dog, but if there are more of such incidents, the government might have to create a quarantine ward for pets,” she said.In the morning, Noida Authority veterinarian Prem Chand had sanctioned a vacant sterilisation centre for the dog. But in the afternoon, he backed out, following a decision by GNIDA CEO Narendra Bhooshan.According to Bhooshan, GNIDA would not take any additional responsibility at this time apart from sanitisation and he would not allow a facility to be opened for a dog without the consent of the chief veterinary officer of the district. The chief vet, Virendra Srivastava, could not be contacted, despite multiple attempts.However, vets say dogs have no threat to be infected by coronavirus. “Till now we have heard of two dog deaths, one in China and another in Hong Kong from a possible Covid 19 infection, but these are not authentic reports, there are no legitimate tests available for the dogs here, also these are untested waters for everyone,” said city-based vet Abhishek Daber.“I am under treatment and my condition is improving. I will be getting out and taking back the dog from the shelter soon,” the dog’s owner said on phone from his hospital.",noida,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74801014,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-76481,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/all-doors-shut-for-9-year-old-labrador-as-owner-tests-positive/articleshow/74801015.cms

On Wednesday morning, we will receive the reports. Four patients are in isolation ward at DMCH and samples of three were sent to a Patiala lab,” said DMCH secretary Prem Gupta.

This is the first local person to test positive in the preliminary examination. Gupta said, “The 55-year-old woman from Gurdev Nagar was admitted to the isolation ward on Monday afternoon with respiratory symptoms. She was screened as per guidelines and samples were sent to Rajindra Hospital, Patiala.”

The health department claimed that all the suspected cases kept in the isolation ward had a travel history and faced minor issues.

However, health officials are still awaiting the final reports of seven more suspected cases, whose samples were sent to the national virology lab.”

“We have sensitised our staff and are carrying out mock drills to prepare them for emergency situations. Authorities have provided adequate number of protective kits to medical staff of the civil hospital to deal with patients facing initial symptoms. The health department has established rapid response teams at the civil hospital and they have been given proper training about taking samples and sending those to laboratories,” he said.

Appealing to citizens not to create panic by spreading fake news on social networking sites, he said everything was under control and people should cooperate with the local administration, police and health officials.

The health department officials asked people to report any cases of illness and about those with foreign travel history. Large-scale awareness drives on the lines of pulse polio campaign have already been launched with the help of local administration in the city, an official said.

At some places, cops made them lie down on road and apologise and at others, they made them do sit-ups, holding their ears. Two scooter-borne youngsters at Mata Rani Chowk were made to sit in the ‘murga’ position, a punishment reminiscent of schooldays.

Unlike Monday, fewer people came out on roads. In Dairy Complex, Haibowal, a dairy owner started distributing free milk in the locality, making residents rush there. The Haibowal police reached the spot and dispersed them. Thereafter, the cops ensured that the residents got milk one by one.

Near Clock Tower, cops made two violators do sit-ups while holding their ears. At Books’ Market, two men in a car were made to lie down on the road and apologise. In Giaspura on Monday night, police made people apologise by holding their ears.

On Tuesday, the Munidya police conducted a raid at a packaged food factory in Hari Nagar of Mundiya Kalan and found it open despite curfew. Sub-inspector Harbhajan Singh, in charge of Mundiya police post, said people were working in the factory without precautions. The police have registered a case against factory owners Inderpal Singh and Harjinder Singh under Section 188 (disobedience of orders duly promulgated by a public servant) of the IPC.

Division 8 police booked one Deepak Kumar and his two unidentified accomplices for triple-riding.

Shimlapuri police station SHO inspector Amandeep Singh said, “Kulwinder had joined the firm about 15 days ago. Naveen was on night duty and Kulwinder and Mahavir on day duty on Monday. While Naveen was at the office at night, Mahavir and Kulwinder were having drinks at their accommodation.”

“The two had an argument over an issue following which Mahavir abused Kulwinder. In a fit of rage, Kulwinder attacked Mahavir with an iron rod, which led to his death, and escaped from there,” the SHO added.

On Tuesday morning when Naveen went upstairs, he found Mahavir lying in a pool of blood and Kulwinder missing. He called up his employer, who sounded the police.

Cops sent the body to civil hospital and apprised Mahavir’s family of the incident.
