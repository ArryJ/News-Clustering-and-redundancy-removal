1,['16/08/2020'],"Malgudi Museum is a tribute to Shankar Nag, says John Devaraj","The news of the long-awaited restoration of the Arasalu Railway Station, in Shivamogga district, has once again brought back fond memories of RK Narayan’s fictional town, Malgudi, which was made popular by the Doordarshan serial Malgudi Days, directed by the late Shankar Nag. Some of the scenes of the 1980s television series were shot at the Arasalu station. Decades later, the Mysuru Division of the South Western Railways took the initiative to renovate the dilapidated station. What’s more interesting, however, is that the premise now houses another space, exhibiting memorabilia of the TV serial. Called the ‘Malgudi Museum’, this new building promises to give visitors a tour of nostalgia through its artefacts. The museum is conceptualised and designed by sculptor and art director John Devaraj.Talking about the challenges he faced while creating the museum, John says, “The railway station is around 120 years old. So, when we were given the task to restore the crumbling structure, we decided to reconstruct it brick by brick. The initial phase itself took nearly two months to complete.” In a bid to retain the old-world charm, the team decided on strengthening the lime-and-mortar walls, instead of demolishing the structure. To create a bucolic atmosphere, installations and mural art replicating flora and fauna of the surroundings – such as peacocks, pangolins and cobras – have been added to the premise, while there are also three animal-themed gates dedicated to the rich wildlife of the region. Those interested in knowing a little more about the storyline of Malgudi Days can take a peek into the termite mound on the wall. There is also a tiger, which appears in the episode A Hero, and a leopard installed on teakwood. These were in possession of the Forest Department earlier. The entire project took 15 months to finish.“When at the museum, visitors can have a glimpse of an old clock that was seen in the serial. The episode, called Gateman’s Gift, which features Swami’s grandmother’s house has been recreated in the museum. The rail bogies that were built using plywood sheets for the show are also on display, while the tea shop has already turned into a selfie-spot for visitors, just within days of the museum’s inauguration,” reveals John.According to the artist, a façade embellished with ceramic murals gives the message of peace and oneness. “The museum has a separate hall dedicated to the late Shankar Nag,” he sums up.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77565461,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-194209/77565461.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/malgudi-museum-is-a-tribute-to-shankar-nag-says-john-devaraj/articleshow/77565409.cms
2,['16/08/2020'],Why Bengaluru must take cue from PM’s speech,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi

BENGALURU: Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day address stressed for multi-modal connectivity and infrastructure, something Bengaluru needs to implement on a war footing.

“We cannot work in silos. The entire country has to move towards multi-modal connectivity infrastructure,” the PM said.

Experts say Bengaluru, plagued by poor coordination between various government agencies and also lack of first- and last-mile connectivity, could take a leaf out of the PM’s speech.

The draft Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP) had proposed elevated walkways of 300-1,500m at 10 locations, but it remains on paper.

The city’s major bus stations like Shantinagar, Mysuru Road Satellite terminus, Yeshwantpur and Peenya are not yet connected with Metro.

For instance, Yeshwantpur Metro station is not yet connected with the railway station, notwithstanding promises of a foot-over-bridge by BMRCL and SWR.

“There is no integration in Bengaluru with various transport modes. BMTC constructed TTMCs as standalone projects using JNNURM funds wherever they got land, without looking at multi-modal integration. Bengaluru has missed the bus and the government should now come up with a plan to integrate different modes,” said RK Misra, urban mobility expert.

Rajkumar Dugar, founder of Citizens 4 Citizens (C4C), blames BMRCL for the lack of integration. Bus and railway stations were already established, but Namma Metro was a new infrastructure facility which failed to integrate, he pointed out.

An urban development department official said the absence of an umbrella agency like Unified Metropolitan Transportation Authority (UMTA) is the main issue.

“It’s difficult to coordinate with multiple agencies and execute a project as there different stakeholders involved. We’re working hard to improve the integration,” the official pointed out.

Respect for India's sovereignty is supreme for us. What our brave soldiers can do for this resolution, what the country can do, the world has seen this in Ladakh,"" Modi said.The remark was seen as a reference to the Galwan Valley clashes where, according to the defence establishment, Indian jawans retaliated against PLA’s aggression by inflicting many casualties on the Chinese side.The PM said despite recent adversities — a reference to the Covid-19 pandemic — there have been “misadventures” on the borders.While he did not name either China or Pakistan, the PM referred to the threats of expansionism and terrorism, in that order, represented by the two hostile neighbours, saying that India’s tough stance has been appreciated. “Recently, as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, 184 countries out of 192 supported India. This is a matter of great pride for every Indian. This is an example of how we have made our place in the world. And this is possible only when India itself is strong, India is powerful and safe,” he said.The brief reference to the ongoing military stand-off in Ladakh came as discussions to disengage at friction points and de-escalate are stalemated due to China’s refusal to pull back its troops despite several rounds of talks. The two sides are now digging in and Indian forces are preparing supplies to last through the winter.“When we embark on an extraordinary journey with an extraordinary goal, the path will also be full of challenges and these challenges too are extraordinary. Notwithstanding the recent adversities, there have been misadventures along the border which threw a challenge to the country. But whoever tried to threaten the sovereignty of our country right from the LoC to the LAC, the army of the country, our brave soldiers have given a befitting reply,” he said.Modi said, “The whole country is full of zeal, driven by conviction and moving forward with unwavering devotion to protect India’s sovereignty. The world has seen what our brave jawans can do in Ladakh...Today, I pay obeisance to all the brave men and soldiers who sacrificed their lives”.In the rest of his speech, Modi expounded in detail on the theme of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ in the context of decisions such as curbs on defence imports that are to be indigenised, national infrastructure projects, a new education policy, development of Tejas fighters, a plan to connect all villages by fibre optical networks, and reforms in taxation and the MSME sector. India can’t continue to be an exporter of raw materials and receiver of finished goods, he said.Modi also said the beginning of the construction of the Ram Temple at Ayodhya is a “peaceful culmination” of the age-old Ram Janambhoomi issue. “The citizens of India have shown exemplary restraint and wisdom, and acted responsibly... Peace, unity and harmony are going to be the strengths of self-reliant India.”There was a pointed reference to the middle class as Modi reassured this vocal segment that the government has not lost sight of their needs. “Whether it is the agriculture sector, small-scale industries sector or the people in services sector, almost all these people, in a way constitute a huge middle class of India,” he said. The government is constantly working to fulfil dreams of the middle class. The middle class has the power to do miracles. So middle class families get the greatest benefits of ease of living. Cheap internet, affordable smartphones and flight tickets — all these things are going to increase the strength of the middle class,” he said.

6,['16/08/2020'],Sweden seals ‘dream’ move to Hyderabad FC,"Panaji: FC Goa winger Sweden Fernandes has secured his dream move to the Indian Super League ( ISL ) after inking a three-year deal with Hyderabad FC .

Sweden, 20, who was part of FC Goa’s developmental squad will get the chance to train under Spanish coach Albert Roca, who famously guided Bengaluru FC to a runnerup finish and took them to the AFC Cup final.

“I was scouted and this is a good opportunity for me. I thank God for everything. I am very excited to train and learn from such an experienced coach,” Sweden told TOI .

Sweden started with junior sides of Sporting Clube de Goa and Dempo Sports Club before his three-year spell with FC Goa. He was nurtured by Gavin Araujo in the U-18 side and later by Clifford Miranda, now assistant in the senior team.

“The three years at FC Goa were very fruitful. They gave me a platform to prove myself and I’m thankful. I played most of the matches in the Second Division I-League this time and it helped me build my confidence,” said Sweden.

FC Goa knew his potential and offered him another three-year contract with a possibility of promotion to the senior side after a year. But amidst interest from some I-League clubs, Hyderabad came calling at just the right time.

At Hyderabad, Sweden will join former teammate Liston Colaco and other Goans Sahil Tavora, Laxmikant Kattimani and international Adil Khan.

Talking about his reason to do a Punjabi show, the actor tells us, “Since I am a Punjabi, I wanted to do something in Punjabi, especially now, when there is so much good content being made in Punjabi.

So I think I learnt how to talk in Punjabi because of my friends in Mumbai! When this show was offered to me, I did wonder if I would manage to speak in Punjabi, but as I began shooting, I realised that I am doing pretty well, and am still getting better at it,” says Angad, who is now also planning to do a Punjabi film soon. “I think this is just a beginning.

18,['16/08/2020'],From pursuing higher studies to starting their own ventures: Models follow alternative career paths as work dries up in corona times,"Travelling to different cities for multiple fashion weeks, juggling their schedules for designer shoots, brand commercials and appearances at fashion events – this is how a typical summer for popular models in the country would usually look like. But amid the global pandemic, when major fashion events are going online and designers and brands are still strategising ways to bring business back on track after the lockdown, many models are left with no option but look for alternatives that might help them sustain their “survival” till next year.One of the models, not wanting to be named, shares that she had pinned her hopes on a fashion week in March, supposed to be held in Delhi, for her major earnings this year. But the cancellation of the fashion week due to COVID-19 was the worst thing that could happen to her. “If that fashion week would have happened, I still would have had savings at least for some months, but now there is no hope. After the lockdown, I am getting a few queries about shoots, but no one really wants to pay. Right now, I think there is no point in staying in Delhi, waiting for work, and paying rent. I am planning to move to my hometown in Punjab and I will prepare for my MBA. Even if I decide to do some modelling assignments, I won’t be completely dependent on it for my income,” she says.In the last so many years that she has been working, supermodel Lakshmi Rana rarely got time to take a break, so her dream of starting a business that focuses on sustainability could never materialise. It was during the lockdown that she realised that this is the best time to invest in her business. “Modelling assignments will keep happening, but I am assuming that the pace at which I was working will not be the same for a long time, not until next year. So I am in the planning phase of starting my business that will focus on sustainability. Having my own business will not just keep me busy, but is a more safe and secure option,” says Lakshmi.Supermodel Sonalika Sahay adds that apart from being part of different exhibitions and taking online workshops, she is in talks to start some more projects in the future.For the male models, the road ahead seems somewhat tougher. “Modelling is a female-dominated industry and women get more and better work than male models, usually. So some female models are still getting some shoots now, but that’s not the case with male models. Since digital is the future, I am switching to taking online grooming and modelling classes,” says supermodel Amit Ranjan.Model Saud says that he is planning to start his own business and is using this time to do his research. “I know so many models who have moved from Mumbai to Delhi recently because the cost of living in Mumbai is much higher, and they can't sustain themselves in Mumbai at a time when assignments have dried up. In these times, even if one does get to do a shoot, it is not financially lucrative. One cannot even earn one’s bread and butter while doing just one shoot a month. So I am planning to start my own business soon and over time, I plan to pursue modelling as a hobby, while my business will become my priority,” says Saud.Going by the popularity of the online medium, many models are taking to online classes and some are turning to social media influencers. Model Erika Packard has already started promoting her digital platform as an influencer and supermodel Hasleen Kaur is working to launch her online venture soon and says that she will soon share details about the same.“Modelling was always a freelance field, but we never felt that we were working on freelance projects as there was always a lot of work and it was a full-time profession till last year. This year has made all of us realise that we are a partof an unorganised sector with no job security. As of today, we do not know when the fashion industry will again have that kind of money and work that we were getting till last year, so it is better to switch to online business as that is the future,” says Hasleen.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77561578,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1053801/77561578.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/fashion/buzz/from-pursuing-higher-studies-to-starting-their-own-ventures-models-follow-alternative-career-paths-as-work-dries-up-in-corona-times/articleshow/77561292.cms
19,['16/08/2020'],Dating online? Beware of being ‘wokefished’,"Looking for someone special in today’s times can be as simple as ‘swiping right’. With the bunch of dating apps available today, they’ve made the whole process of meeting a potential partner rather easy. But virtual romances also bring in their own evils — from people sharing a fake picture or lying about their age aka catfishing, vanishing physically and digitally on you à la ghosting, or even dial-toning, where someone gives you their phone number, but never picks up when you call. And to add to the many negative dating trends is the new term, ‘wokefishing’. Yes, it is an offshoot of being ‘woke’, which refers to a perceived awareness of issues relating to social justice. But this one takes things further — it’s about pretending to be ‘woke’ to just impress a potential date. Why is it relevant today? Because like it or not, in today’s times, appearing to be aware of issues that matter — politics, social, racial or more — defines the new progressive millennial.Using knowledge to charm someone is one thing, but pretending to be someone you are not, is another, says Purvi Shah, psychologist and mental health advocate. “It takes time to get to know someone, and that also holds true for online dating. Don’t believe everything the person says or give away too much about yourself, which is anyway the number one rule for any relationship. A lot of non-verbal cues also give signs of a wokefisher, for instance you might see him or her appearing uncertain when you ask about something on a video chat. If someone is trying too hard to gain your trust, it’s a red flag. Take time to read the person. For instance, he may say, ‘I am a feminist’, but tends to speak about women in a degrading manner, then that’s a question mark.” She makes another important point. “We gravitate towards people who share, or say they share your belief on certain issues. But that should not be a mandate, don’t look for someone only in your plane of thought.”Marketing executive Tanisha Karani was wokefished recently and the experience was an eye-opener. “I met this guy online during the lockdown. He mentioned that he was a climate warrior, and that greenery and sustainability defined his life. But a week later, when I casually spoke about how climate and sustainability needed to be subjects in college, he scoffed at that. I think he forgot that he had mentioned these things as being important to him. At first, I was confused, but then I realised that he might be masquerading about a lot of other things. I decided to hold off our plans to meet after that.”Interior design expert Sonya Naresh had a similar experience. “This person I came across on a dating app had a cool profile and his bio mentioned that he is a feminist and an advocate for human rights. I liked that and as we got chatting, we started to discuss the ‘Black Lives Matter’ issue. But he didn’t seem to know anything about it. After a little bit more of conversation, I realised that he actually wasn’t aware of any of these issues. I ended the conversation politely and had a private laugh.”",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77566083,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-168076/77566083.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/dating-online-beware-of-being-wokefished/articleshow/77566012.cms
20,['16/08/2020'],Abhishek Pathak: OTT platforms are competitive and choose content very carefully,"FacebookTwitterPintrest

As a young content creator, producer-director Abhishek Pathak has taken several leaps of faith — casting newcomers, backing newer directors, and releasing a project close to his heart on an OTT platform. The filmmaker, who believes that the film business is poised for change, talks to BT about his first direct-to-OTT release, Khuda Haafiz , and more. Excerpts:Yes, we were excited and nervous, because this is new for us. The film reached a much wider audience. We have spent about two years developing, writing and filming it. Vidyut Jammwal and Shivaleeka Oberoi (lead actors) have been fabulous to work with.I am particular about the stories of my films, and always insist on a two-minute narration. I ask a filmmaker what he will put into the trailer of his film. If it grips me, I read the screenplay and take it further. I’ve known Faruk Kabir (director) for long. He asked for five minutes to narrate the story of Khuda Haafiz, and it impressed me so much that we decided to make the film in the first meeting itself.Previously, when films went to OTT platforms, they had already been through the box-office litmus test. But now, when they’re directly releasing on digital platforms, the pressure of delivering box-office numbers is low. Also, the audience’s taste differs from cinema halls to TV screens to OTT platforms, people don’t consume the same things everywhere. So, parallel businesses will come into existence now. Even OTT platforms are competitive and choose content very carefully. In the long run, this will turn out to be a fabulous option for creators. Previously, one had to think about the logistics of releasing a slightly unconventional film in cinemas. This is a good way to take every deserving film to its audience.The film was going through edits when the lockdown happened. So, even if we wanted to, we would not have been able to release it in theatres. Khuda Haafiz has been mounted on a scale meant for the big screen, but eventually, when we got the offer to open on an OTT platform, and there was no date for cinemas to open, we had to make a decision.Yes, we waited for 45 days to see how things are going. And then, we started locking projects, because things won’t settle so soon. Though shoots have begun, people are taking it slow. All eyes are on the team of Bellbottom. If everything goes well there, many producers can also hope to start work soon.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77567379,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-200176/77567379.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/abhishek-pathak-ott-platforms-are-competitive-and-choose-content-very-carefully/articleshow/77567380.cms

Karnataka

Outfit accused of inciting Tuesday’s violence says that is not their agendaSocial Democratic Party of India (SDPI) which is in the news in connection with inciting violence in parts of East Bengaluru on Tuesday night, traces its origin to the banned Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), says Prof. Mohyiuddin N Karassery, writer and activist from Kohzikode, Kerala.Launched on June 21, 2009 in Delhi, SDPI is the political wing of the controversial Popular Front of India (PFI) which several intelligence agencies and the BJP term as a ‘terrorist outfit.’On April 13, 2010, SDPI was registered as aand started contesting elections. But over the years its electoral presence has been minimal and limited toand Kerala.SDPI on its official website says that it is a cadre-based party that prepares members from ‘’grass roots to assume leadership to tackle social and political challenges.’’More than its electoral campaigns, SDPI was in the news whenever there were violent protests - be it during the anti Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), or Padarayanapura violence and the Tuesday night arson in Bengaluru. PFI was accused of being involved in the murder of RSS worker Rudresh in Bengaluru besides inciting violence in the coastal region of the State.Prof. Karassery says, “ SIMI believed in engineering an Islamic Revolution like in Iran. Like SIMI, PFI and SDPI believe in resisting the atrocities against Muslims, if required with arms,’’ he said adding that it is only recently that SDPI is talking about democratic process, otherwise they never believed in democracy.‘’That is a propaganda by the BJP and the RSS,” says Tasleem Ahamed Rehmani, National Secretary of the SDPI and president of the Muslim Political Council, Delhi.He accuses the State government of using violence to consolidate its base ahead of the BBMP elections besides diverting attention from the Rs 2,000 crore covid-19 scam in Bengaluru.Karnataka Tourism Minister CT Ravi says that it is an open secret that SDPI is a fear mongering and divisive outfit whose main agenda is inciting violence using Islamic fundamental ideology.PFI, the parent organisation of SDPI, was formed by merging three different organisations - Karnataka Forum for Dignity (KFD), National Development Front (NDF) in Kerala and Manitha Neethi Pasarai (MNP) in Tamil Nadu on November 22, 2006.Some of the founders of PFI include E Abubacker and Prof P Koya who were also the founding members of SIMI in 1977 in Aligarh Muslim University, Uttar Pradesh.NDF got a firm footing in the Malabar region after the Islamic Sevak Sangh was banned in 1992 after the Babri Masjid demolition. After NDF was banned in 1994, PFI was formed.One of NDF’s agenda was to adhere to the Dawa (missionary work) and work for welfare of the minorities with a focus on Kerala Muslims.Prof. Karassery says that SIMI became NDF and later PFI and SDFI.“SIMI of those days (1977) and the SIMI which was banned in 2001 were two different outfits. SIMI in the 1990’s was a radical outfit,’’ says Rehmani dismissing theories that SDPI is a new avatar of the banned SIMI. SIMI is the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH), a pre-independence organisation, which was founded in 1941. SIMI, formed in 1977, severed ties with JIH and turned militant in two years, says Prof Karassery. The Central government banned SIMI post 9/11 terror attacks. In 2019, the ban was extended by another five years.CT Ravi alleges that PFI and SDPI are new fronts of SIMI. ‘’Look at the people who are behind these and it becomes clear,’’ he said.Rehmani, however, says that many groups from Southern States had come together to form NDF. “SIMI was not banned in those days. ubsequently, NDF was banned by Kerala government after which the PFI was formed,’’ he said.Rehmani says that the SDPI doesn’t believe in violence and like any other political party in India, they are law-abiding and uphold the constitution of India.He said that despite several attempts by RSS and the BJP to project SDPI as a terror organisation, the party has been given a clean chit by investigating agencies and police in several States.‘’The BJP and the RSS are using us as the face of hatred, to show the Hindu masses or to their Bhakts that these are the Muslims and they are a threat to the Hindutva movement. Every now and then they use the media to focus on us. Earlier they used to name Jaamat - e - Islam Hind which was never a radical outfit. Now they name us,” Rehmani pointed.Prof Karassery says that SDPI has no stable political stand. ‘’In Kerala, they have aligned with the UDF and LDF. They praise Osama Bin Laden. They believe in Jamaat-e-Islam founder Abul ala Maududi’s hukumat-e-ilahia or the Allah’s Kingdom,’’ he said.‘’Like RSS, PFI also claims that they are cultural organisation. But everyone knows who they are what their intention is,’’ Prof. Karassery said.The Congress, however, says that there is more to this than meets the eye. The party has time and again accused the BJP of propping up PFI and SDPI with a plan to weaken secular parties and pursue its divisive and hate politics.‘’Why has the BJP government not banned it even one year after being in power in Karnataka?,’’ asked the former home minister Ramalinga Reddy, accusing the two of being hand in glove.Rehmani, however, denies the charge and says that SDPI is caught between the between the Congress and BJP.“We are hardcore opponents of BJP. This is the truth,” he said.""On the other side, secular parties think we are taking away their vote base. But their biggest threat is hardcore Hindutva. After August 5 (Bhoomi Pooja at Ayodhya), every secular party is trapped and resorted to the same politics. They fear that 80 per cent of Hindu votes might go to the BJP. The left over Muslim votes will also be going to SDPI,’’ is their worry, he argues.CT Ravi dismissed the charge of promoting SDPI and PFI. ‘’Why would we promote an anti-national force? They are a threat to the country and the BJP would never join hands with such elements,’’ he said and accused the Congress of indulging in appeasement politics by backing SDPI and PFI.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-630931,msid-77568112/77568112.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/the-what-why-where-when-how-about-sdpi/articleshow/77569340.cms
23,['16/08/2020'],"Dhoni, Raina retire, leaving fans asking Thala pola varuma?","For the rest of India, they are Dhoni and Raina. For people of Tamil Nadu, they are Thala and Chinna Thala. The cricket-crazy fans of the state adopted these two distinctive cricketers as their own. Now, as cricket fever was slowly gripping them again, thanks to the upcoming IPL, Dhoni and Raina’s retirement announcements have left their legion of fans stumped.I would simply say that Dhoni is one of the greatest captains and the most successful cricketer I have ever seen. I am fortunate to have pleasant memories with him as the chairman of the selection committee during the 2011 World Cup. The T20 World Cup, the 2011 World Cup and then, the Champions Trophy — all those are outstanding achievements. My congratulations to him and may he have happy retirement days. And Raina has been a dangerous player in both ODIs and T20s.- Krishnamachari Srikkanth, former cricketer and former chairman of the selection committeeIt is very difficult for someone who is from outside Chennai to be accepted here, but Dhoni was accepted and he became a cult hero. It’s a different level of achievement altogether. Dhoni embraced Chennai, the whistle podu culture and everything about the city. He genuinely loves the city. Whenever I got a chance to interview him, I felt a certain aura around him. When you think of CSK , Dhoni and Raina are two names that are synonymous with the team. Raina announcing his retirement with Dhoni sort of establishes the kind of relationship they have. Raina has always been there when Dhoni needed him on the field. This is a start of new partnership.- Suhail Chandhok, commentatorDhoni and Raina are two players who get a lot of love from all over India, not just Chennai. Dhoni is the greatest captain India has ever produced. He was a great batsman who could finish matches at will. He had an outstanding career. Raina was also a great cricketer, especially in ODIs and T20s. It’s such a big loss to Indian cricket. I was the chairman of the selection committee when Dhoni was selected as the captain for the T20 World Cup, in 2007. Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Zaheer Khan had expressed their inability to play the World Cup. We had to pick a fresh captain for a new team that hadn’t played in the format! He was very happy, but since he is not expressive, he remained calm when we told him that he was going to lead the team. It was wonderful to see him lead the team and win the World Cup. I’ve been watching Raina from his U-14 days when I was the chairman of Talent Resource Development Wing. I’m very happy we spotted him and groomed him at the National Cricket Academy (NCA).- Dilip Vengsarkar, former cricketer and chairman of the selection committeeDhoni and Raina are not only 200 per cent fit to play in the IPL, but also in T20 international cricket. Dhoni is indispensable in the T20 format even today. So, he must be in an upbeat mood with the IPL just around the corner. And that could probably be the reason why he made his retirement announcement in Chennai. He knew he would not feel low if he announced his retirement in Chennai.- Bosskey, cricket show host and actorRetirement was an idea planted in Dhoni’s mind as people kept on asking him about his future plans. He’ll be missed in the blue jersey. There are so many life lessons to learn from the way he plays a match. In real life, too, his matches inspire us to give our best with whatever we have without worrying about the result. I met him for the first time in 2014. Since then, he acknowledges me every time he sees me. There may come another captain who might help India win one more World Cup, but there won’t be anyone to replace Dhoni behind the stumps.- Saravanan Hari, Dhoni’s super fan",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77567857,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1004157/77567857.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/dhoni-raina-retire-leaving-fans-asking-thala-pola-varuma/articleshow/77567857.cms

According to the PMC’s Bogus Doctors Committee, Todkar was previously found to be practising as an alterna- tive medicine expert without affiliation to any medical council. In this regard, an FIR was filed against him on July 18 this year atpolice station, under sections 33 and 36 of the Maharashtra Medical Practitioners Act.Now, health officials of PMC and even those in Sangamner have come across fresh ads on social media, retailing his immunity booster named TONO-16 and proclaiming its availability at the aforementioned drug store.Dr Suresh Gholap, taluka health officer (THO) of Sangamner, confirmed that the man was also earlier booked by them for practising sans licence; and yet, ads for his medicines have gone viral on social media just now. “We have issued a notice to the drug store in question as the man is already accused of bogus doctor charges. Now, orders have been given to file an offense against him under sections 33 (2) (act in contravention of any of the provisions of sub-section) and 36 of Maharashtra Medical Council Act, 1961, and the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisement) Act, 1954, for peddling the immunity booster. Primary investigations are going on in this case and an offense will be registered soon,” he said.On a similar note, SB Patil, joint commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA-Drug) Pune division, said investigations will be carried first, after which the required action will be taken based on the violation. “We need to first check if the centre that manufactured the said immunity booster tonic has the licence to do so. Even if the manufacturer has a licence, we will take samples to find out if the product is genuine and as per norms. Then, further action will be taken as per the findings,” said Patil.Confirming the case, PMC health chief Dr Ramchandra Hankare said Todkar has already been booked for practising without a licence under the civic body’s limits, and officials have now written to the cyber-crime cell about removing the objectional advertisement from social media. “The review meeting of the Bogus Doctors Committee did not take place recently due to the pandemic. We plan to write to Pune CP to take stern action against Todkar. He has no affiliation with any medical council and is still practising as an expert,” he said.Despite repeated attempts by Mirror, Todkar was not available for comment on the development.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-240630,msid-77552646/77552646.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-moves-cp-to-act-against-bogus-doctor/articleshow/77569351.cms

28,['16/08/2020'],New cybersecurity policy coming for digital India,"Representative photo

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday that India will soon have a new cyber security policy as the country goes digital, and dependence on cyberspace increases manifold.

“In a short span of time, a draft of new cyber security policy would be presented to the nation. In the coming times, we will have to integrate everything and then work within the framework of this cyber security. We will formulate strategies to move forth,” he said in his Independence Day speech.

The focus on a fresh framework to secure cyberspace comes amid heightened threat due to the tension at the borders and was accompanied by a reiteration on connecting the country’s six lakh villages through an optic-fibre network over the next three years.

PM also set a 1,000-day deadline for connecting Lakshadweep through a submarine optical fibre cable network to provide high-speed internet connectivity on the lines of a recent initiative in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

Modi said that while India’s dependence on cyberspace is increasing strongly in an era of technology, cyberspace carries its own risks and threats which were evident to the world.

“It can be a threat to the social fabric of our country, our economy and can even threaten the development of our nation; we are very well-aware of that. India is very cautious and is planning to take steps to combat these risks,” he said, adding that new systems to protect the cyberspace are continuously being developed.

The government had first prepared a National Cyber Security Policy in 2013, Last year, the National Security Council Secretariat had sought inputs for a new five-year framework. Over the years cyber attacks have become more complex with the population using the internet for its daily needs growing at a rapid pace. India has the second-highest number of internet users and among the top spam senders and is seen to be highly vulnerable to cybercrime . Several government establishments, such as NHAI, have faced attacks in recent weeks.

29,['16/08/2020'],"Govt mulling revising legal age of marriage for girls, hints PM Modi","NEW DELHI: In a hint that government is considering revising upward the legal age of marriage for girls which is currently 18 years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday a decision on “what should be the right age of marriage for girls” would be taken as soon as a committee set-up to study the issue submits its report. “To end malnutrition among girls, to assess what should be the age of marriage, we have set-up a committee,” the PM said.As of now, while the legal age of marriage in India is 18 years for girls, it is 21 for boys. Anaemia and malnutrition are common afflictions in underage mothers and relate to marriages taking place in the 16-18 age group. That proportion, though declining, is significant even now.The task force headed by social activist Jaya Jaitly was set-up in June as a follow-up to the announcement made by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Union budget for 2020-21 where she stated, “women’s age of marriage was increased from 15 to 18 years in 1978, by amending the erstwhile Sharda Act of 1929. As India progresses further, opportunities open up for women to pursue higher education and careers. There are imperatives of lowering maternal mortality ratio (MMR) as well as improvement of nutrition levels. The entire issue about the age of a girl entering motherhood needs to be seen in this light.”The task force has the mandate to examine matters pertaining to the age of motherhood, imperatives of lowering maternal mortality rate, improvement of nutritional levels and related issues. It has to also suggest suitable legislations or amendments in existing laws and a detailed rollout plan with timelines to implement these recommendations. TOI has learnt that the task force which was supposed to give its report till July 31, is yet to submit it to the government.The 2001 census said, “In the age group of 15-49 years — the prime child bearing age group — 81.4% of women are married. This percentage is high due to lower female age at marriage in many parts of the country.""The age of marriage has been a point of debate for long. The National Human Rights Commission too has raised the need for uniform age for marriage for both men and women from time to time. In 140 countries the age of marriage is 18 for both men and women. Even the Law Commission in a consultative paper on family laws in 2018 suggested that the legal age for marriage for both men and women across religions should be recognized at 18 years, the universal age for majority. It does not, however, seem likely that the male age of marriage will be reduced given the government's focus on dealing with malnutrition in underage and young brides.Settling a very critical issue pertaining to under age marriages, the Supreme Court in 2017 had ruled that “sexual intercourse with a minor wife amounts to rape, as under no circumstances can a child below 18 years give consent, express or implied, for sexual intercourse”. However, the government’s proposal to bring the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act in synchronisation with the judgement to make child marriages “void ab initio” (invalid at the outset) is yet to take the shape of a decision.An analysis of child marriage and teenage pregnancies shared by National Commission for Protection of Child Rights and voluntary organisation Young Lives in 2018 shows that while overall prevalence of child marriage among 15 -19 year - old girls declined significantly from 26.5% in 2005-06 to 11.9% in 2015-16, poverty and status of education are key factors in the circumstances that lead to child marriage. The study also reveals that amongst the married girls aged 15 to 19 years, 31.5% girls were found to have babies. Almost a quarter of the married girls in the age group of 15 to 16 years had at least one baby.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77570187,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-194714,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-mulling-revising-legal-age-of-marriage-for-girls-hints-pm-modi/articleshow/77568323.cms

""Kamala Harris. Will we all know she's smart, she's tested, she's prepared. But another thing that makes Kamala so inspiring is her mother's immigrant story to America that started in India, with the pure courage and brought her daughters to this moment,"" he said.

WASHINGTON: The Joe Biden Administration will place a "" high priority "" on continuing to strengthen the US-India relationship, his campaign said on Saturday adding that if elected he will have ""no tolerance"" for cross-border terrorism in South Asia.

Biden campaign on Saturday released a policy document, which says Biden Administration will work with India to support a ""rules-based and stable Indo-Pacific region"" in which no country, including China, is able to ""threaten its neighbours with impunity.

""Biden will deliver on his long-standing belief that India and the United States are natural partners, and a Biden Administration will place a high priority on continuing to strengthen the US-India relationship,"" it said.

""No common global challenge can be solved without India and the United States working as responsible partners, Biden's campaign said on Joe Biden's agenda for the Indian American community,"" it added.

On immigration, Biden will ""preserve family unification as a core principle of our immigration system"", increase the number of visas offered for permanent, work-based immigration -- Green Cards, overturning the Trump administration's switch to a merit-based system.

""He will support first reforming the temporary visa system for high-skill, speciality jobs to protect wages and workers, then expanding the number of visas offered and eliminating the limits on employment-based green cards by country, which have kept so many Indian families in waiting for too long. Biden will restore and defend the naturalization process for green cardholders,"" the document read.

On the rising tide of hate and bigotry on India Americans, Biden will ""enact legislation prohibiting someone convicted of a hate crime from purchasing or possessing a firearm.""

""Biden will appoint leaders at the Department of Justice who will prioritize the prosecution of hate crimes, and he will order his Justice Department to focus additional resources to combat hate crimes -- including religion-based hate crimes -- and to confront white nationalist terrorism,"" the policy document read.

""As the world's oldest and largest democracies, the United States and India are bound together by our shared democratic values: fair and free elections, equality under the law, and the freedom of expression and religion. These core principles have endured throughout each of our nations' histories and will continue to be the source of our strength in the future,"" the document said.

Biden will ensure that South Asian Americans are represented in his administration, starting with his Vice-Presidential nominee, Senator Kamala Harris , whose mother emigrated from India to study and build a life in the United States.

""Our government will reflect the diversity of the United States, and Indian American voices will be included in shaping the policies that impact their communities. From fighting COVID-19 to building our economy back better to reforming our system of immigration, a Biden-Harris Administration will be one that Indian-Americans can count on,"" it said.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump said on Saturday he would move next week to trigger a "" snapback "" of sanctions on Iran at the United Nations .

""We'll be doing a snapback,"" Trump told reporters one day after the U.N. Security Council rejected a US bid to extend a U.N. arms embargo on Iran. ""You'll be watching it next week.""

The United States has threatened to trigger a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran using a provision in a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, known as snapback, even though Trump abandoned the accord in 2018. Diplomats have said the United States would face a tough, messy battle in any such move.

NEW DLEHI: Now, in its sixth month, work from home ( WFH ) in India has had its share of hiccups. From erratic internet connectivity to power cuts to uncomfortable chairs, the transition hasn’t been quite smooth for many. But since it’s part of the ‘new normal’, companies are taking steps to make remote working easier for employees.A couple of months ago, Google had announced it would give every employee $1,000 to buy necessary equipment and office furniture. Now, several Indian startups have also introduced benefits to keep up productivity and motivation of their staff.Edtech startup Great Learning , which has announced WFH till September, started a monthly Covid-19 allowance of Rs 1,000 in June, which covers Wi-Fi , internet and UPS installations, official phone expenses and workstation setup. Recently, they’ve also started collaborating with furniture rental apps to home-deliver ergonomic chairs and desks. Until now, about 204 of their 500-plus employees have availed the benefits.“By the end of May, we accepted that this would be a fairly long drawn work-from-home situation,” says Karthik G, director, people operations. “It hit us that a lot of our employees are young and working from home for the first time, and would never invest in a good internet connection or comfortable chair.” In addition to the allowance, the company also offered to pay for special requirements such as LAN cabling for employees who required high speed internet.For companies, WFH allowances make good business sense apart from the empathy, says Kartik Mandaville, CEO of HR tech firm Springworks. Besides a one-time allowance of up to Rs 25,000 for a home office setup, it offered a one-time reimbursement of Rs 3,000 for headphones and a monthly internet reimbursement of Rs 1,500.Bengaluru-based cloud service provider G7 CR Technologies has even shipped free chairs and desks from its office to the homes of employees who required them, apart from providing home inverters to those who had frequent power cuts.

43,['16/08/2020'],PM Modi pushes for self-reliant India with 'Make for World' call,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the call for ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ the central theme of his seventh Independence Day speech, seeking to pitch the country as a manufacturing hub , with “Make for World” as the mantra so that that local value additions help the country make the switch from a supplier of natural resources and raw materials and importer of finished products.“Our country has plenty of natural resources. It is the need of the hour that we start the value addition of these natural resources and human resources; and to take the country to new heights. How long shall we continue to export raw material to the world? How long will the process of exporting raw material and importing finished goods continue? So, we will have to be self-reliant,” Modi said, while pointing to self-sufficiency in key food products such as wheat. In address to an industry chamber two months ago, he had called upon companies to play a big role in the global supply chain.On Saturday, the PM indicated that the government intends to integrate rural industry and the farm sector into the overall strategy, promising to set up special economic zones in rural areas. “A web of agriculture and non-agriculture industries will be created. We have tried to create FPO (Farmer Product Association) which will go a long way in their economic empowerment,” he said.In mid-May, the PM had given a call for self-reliance while announcing the phasing out of the coronavirus-induced lockdown and amid border tension with China, which has intensified since then, prompting the government to impose curbs on Chinese imports, investments and mobile applications. India is heavily dependent on China for mobile phones, electronic goods and pharmaceuticals, resulting in a massive trade deficit. In the first term, the government had launched the ‘Make in India’ campaign, focused on boosting domestic production, increasing the share of the manufacturing sector in the economy.Drawing upon his earlier slogan of manufacturing in the country with “zero defects”, while ensuring “zero effect” on the environment, Modi suggested policies, processes and products must be “par excellence”.Referring to the skepticism over the call for self-reliance, Modi said the goal of self-reliance would indeed entail challenges, but the country had found solutions to various challenges and pointed to the production of N95 masks and PPE kits, which were not manufactured in the country until the Covid-19 outbreak.He also said that ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ meant an overall strategy, that was not limited to limiting imports. “When we talk about becoming self-reliant, we do not merely refer to decreasing the import demands. When we talk of self-reliance, it is about our skills, our human resources. When we start sourcing things from abroad, our capabilities start depleting and consequently, it gets completely destroyed over generations. We need to preserve it and enhance that calibre of ours. We need to accentuate our skills, our creativity and with that we need to touch new heights. We need to strengthen skill development for a self-reliant India, for improving our competency.”",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77568589,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-39693,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-pushes-for-self-reliant-india-with-make-for-world-call/articleshow/77568558.cms
44,['16/08/2020'],Hail Britannica! The new uses of old encyclopedias,"Among the things I never dreamt I’d grow close to again, until lockdown, was my parents’ encyclopedias. During the pandemic, I’ve spent months back in my family home, and the old boxed dictionaries and encyclopedias have a new place in my life: underneath my laptop. They had the right dimensions and solidity, which no other household item offered, to raise coffee-tables to writing-desk height.It’s an honest but solemn demotion, like a great teacher from your school-days now retired and driving the bus. As a kid, I spent long enchanted hours splashing around in my children’s encyclopedia set. Printed on each volume’s spine was a pair of words, marking its alphabetical range; Aborigines to Comets, Comics to Ghana, Ghosts to Monsoon . These pairings still give me a thrill, recalling that pristine sense of how much there was in the universe, all with epic names waiting to be known – Monsters to Sculpture, Sea to Zulus. When I die, the words I’ll have re-read most often will probably be entries of the 1994 Oxford Children’s Encyclopedia.The adult volumes had a whole different aura. They were not friends for imaginative play, but hefty proud Gods to be touched with respect and carried against the chest with both arms. Unbelievably, their pages were numbered in the thousands. They heaved open like ocean swell, cold and deep and dense with matter, most of it strange and unknown, like Praetoria and Spinoza and tort. One of these boxed double-volumes, amazingly called an Oxford “compact” dictionary, has an actual drawer with a stately magnifying glass inside, which we weren’t meant to touch.As privileged members of the ‘Xennial’ generation, we never actually used them. The Columbia Encyclopedia (Fifth Edition), which I am typing on top of right now, was published in 1993, the fateful year when Microsoft released a product called Encarta on a CD-ROM. It was a few more years before I watched Encarta ’95 load up at a friend’s home, its audio-montage lifting off on the voice of Nelson Mandela , saying, “Let there be justice, for all. Let there be peace, for all.” (A slick corporate appropriation that no Zoomer would abide, but which I cooed at lovingly in the late nineties).It should have just said: Let there be Wikis for all. Encarta compressed multiple giant encyclopedias into a weightless silver disk, and the rest is browser history. Wikipedia is now my favourite thing online – boundless, free, participatory and collectively governed; the only site I use that still feels true to the original promise of the world wide web. The encyclopedia under my laptop runs to over six million words, but the one on my laptop screen has more than six million full entries, just in English. And it occupies no physical space in my world at all.I vaguely remember, in the late ’90s, how the print encyclopedia became declassed: a product for families who couldn’t afford a PC. Before long, it was reduced to being hawked door-to-door by distressed sales trainees. Angstfully I would answer the door to encyclopedias, and shut it on their faces. Nobody needed them. Meanwhile, the mighty idols of my parents’ bookshelves turned still, then petrified – shifted only for dusting, or this year, to be laid on their sides for me to type on.It makes me almost emotional, but mostly just thoughtful, to see the most learned of books become the most basic of furniture; their paper as good as wood again. They still have the appeal of antiques – I condescend to love their weathered texture and sheer weight. I even Instagrammed some pictures of them, surrounded by my coffee cups and laptop and Bluetooth headsets. I call that “booksing”. Almost a decade ago, I noticed a sudden online explosion of appreciation for books, which seemed to have less to do with reading them than with using them as interior design. “Booksing,” I complained, “is a palliative appreciation for books as things, which muddles up the nostalgia for a more tactile world with our anxiety about just not reading enough.”Now it’s 2020 and I’m nostalgic for booksing. Little of what I write appears on paper anymore, to clutter or to flatter anyone’s home. Yet all the best work I did as a journalist, through my twenties, has disappeared from the internet – erased or deleted with websites that failed technical or political tests. Nothing I’ve done has brought those stories back. And everything online is susceptible in the same way, encoded in formats we will one day forget how to read, just like all those Encarta CD-ROMs. Digital content promises to last forever, but could vanish at a click or an electronic flicker. This boxed encyclopedia before me? You couldn’t erase it with an axe. We may yet come to rely on its knowledge – preserved in old-fashioned mass and dimensions – even if, for now, all we need is an old solid block and nothing else we have is like that anymore.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77565679,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-480234,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/hail-britannica-the-new-uses-of-old-encyclopedias/articleshow/77565672.cms

Instead of debating the pros and cons of menstrual leave after Zomato’s announcement, we spoke tofemale — and male — employees who already have this option on how it’s working for themMy company introduced menstrual leave in 2017, giving female employees the option of taking one day of paid leave every month. I’ve been working at this digital media company for the last two and a half years, and yet I’ve never availed of this option because I don’t get really cramps or discomfort the way a lot of other women do. The leave is optional and given in goodwill. I don’t feel the need to take advantage of the leave just because it’s given to me. However, in the future, if I do get cramps or can’t bear the discomfort, I will definitely take it.A lot of other employees do take it, and are not afraid to talk about it. To my knowledge, nobody has misused/taken advantage of it. Before this option, women either have had to come to work on the most painful day of their menstrual cycle or make up some excuse. Of course, the holiday can’t take away their pain but it does give women a break on the days they are most uncomfortable.I think more companies should adopt this policy since it also helps reduce the taboo. We have also educated male managers about this leave and introduced an online system of self-approved leave so women are comfortable taking it. Since it is not a part of the existing casual or sick leave, it has been called ‘First Day of Period’. It is fair to keep it over and above sick leave because menstruation is not a sickness.In 2018, the company introduced ‘rahat leave’, through which we get a day of paid menstrual leave every month. Since then, I have taken three menstrual leaves when I got severe pain. But I’ve seen other female colleagues in my department who have PCOD and get cramps avail it more often.I work an eight-hour shift in the control room of the blast furnace , so my job is to keep the furnace parameters stable and ensure hot metal quality control. It is a continuous process, and we have the most responsibility because if anything goes wrong, it affects the quality of the metal. Earlier, if we had pain, we had to bear it or apply for a casual leave because to get a sick leave you need to be certified unfit. But even then, when you apply for casual leave too often, others ask why you need leave every month.Now, we don’t need separate approval. We just need to send a message or call our superior. Some women feel shy in asking for menstrual leave, so it helps that it is called rahat leave. We’re very happy and use it responsibly only when we need it. We also have a sanitary pad vending machine and disposal bin at work now which is very helpful.When the policy was first introduced, there was a meeting for women employees where we were told that we shouldn’t hesitate in asking for rahat leave. We even told our male colleagues that we’ve been granted this leave, and they understood since they too get paternity leave.‘I use day off to help my wife who gets bad cramps’I’ve been married for two years but I’ve been in a relationship with my wife for 12 years so I know how painful her period is, especially the first two days. So when my company, a platform for aspiring entrepreneurs, announced a one-day menstrual leave policy for married men to take care of their partners (and two days for female employees) in June, I thought it would help me support my wife, whether it is household chores such as cleaning or helping out in the kitchen during the lockdown when we had no help, or heating the water bottles for her. I’m just trying to be there for her physically and emotionally in any form.To apply for the leave, we just have to drop an email a day in advance. I’ve availed the policy in the last two months. I feel it’s a step towards a more holistic working environment for people. If a policy helps employees perform to their optimal level, then I feel there shouldn’t be a problem.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77565641,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-697999,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/meet-the-people-who-have-period-leave/articleshow/77565635.cms

The government having decreed that Covid-19 patients who were either asymptomatic or suffering mild symptoms could opt for isolation at home, the elderly man opted to stay in a room on the second floor of his home, which had an adjoining bathroom.The 67-year-old man admitted to TOI that he could not sleep on the day he was confirmed infected. “I was given tablets for the fever I had, and the next day, it abated a little. By the third day, my condition had improved. I had no fever and my throat was no longer sore. I was also being given kashaya made at home, and I started practising yoga. I never watched TV, but started reading books. Healthy food, good sleep and some pills helped me recover, and I was declared fit to be out of quarantine after a fortnight,” he said.In another case, a 37-year-old man, resident of Old Hubballi, working at a private firm, said that he had a sore throat and fever when he was confirmed infected. “I stay with my mother, and I opted for home quarantine . I consulted our family doctor, and my neighbours were kind enough to get me the medicines I needed, and they provided us food for nearly a fortnight,” he said.The patient was equally effusive in expressing gratitude to doctors at the Dharwad Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, who called him regularly and ensured he stayed positive. His routine was not dissimilar to that of the elderly patient, only that he opted to watch movies during his stay at home, while staying on a healthy diet that included lot of dry fruits. “I started feeling much better from the very third day,” he added.",hubballi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77571098,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-187795,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/these-patients-opted-for-home-quarantine-beat-the-pandemic/articleshow/77567781.cms

The government has already cleared proposals worth Rs 30,626.50 crore in a month.

Minister of large and medium scale industries Jagadish Shettar told TOI that the government is committed to ‘Kalyan’ (welfare) of the region. “As a result of various subsidies and concessions announced for investors, many are approaching us voluntarily and we are clearing proposals on priority basis,” he added.

Gaurav Gupta, principal secretary to government, commerce and industries department, Bengaluru, said the government has already allotted land and provided all infrastructures. “Though the outer limit to set units is two years, some industries may start production within 6 months and some in a year. As the region is near to Hyderabad airport, and as Kalaburagi airport is expected to attract more airlines, all industries are expected to start operations within two years,” he said.

Over 3,000 acres of land is being developed at Kadechur village in Yadgir district for the past 4-5 years, he said further. “Now, 16 pharmaceutical and drugs industries have been allotted land and they are investing Rs 962.5 crore and will create over 3,000 jobs,” he said.

Karnataka Udyog Mitra (KUM) managing director H M Revannagowda said Kalaburagi district is getting investment to the tune of Rs 1,680.3 crore while Ballari has cleared proposals worth 16,962.9 crore. “Koppal has got investment of Rs 761 crore, while Kalaburagi and Yadgir have got joint investments of about Rs 82.20 crore. As of now investors have assured us of creating 7,000 jobs,” he said.

“We welcome this development wholeheartedly, but our three long pending demands — 100% tax exemption on the lines of Himachal Pradesh to pharmaceutical industry, introduction of turnover-based tax exemption to ensure investors focus more production, to set up inland depot container at Wadi Railway Junction and runway upgrade at Kalaburagi airport on par with international airports to promote exports — have not been met,” said Hyderabad-Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kalaburagi) president Amarnath Patil.

HUBBALLI: The Old Hubballi police have arrested five accused in the Irfan alias Fruit Irfan murder case on Saturday.

The arrested accused are Aftab Mohammadali Bepari,23, a resident of Manikilla area of Dharwad, Tousif Sadiq Nippani,24, of Shaikh Compound, Dharwad, Atiyabkhan Tadkod,23, a resident of Madarmaddi , Dharwad, Amir Tamatgar, 22, of Old Hubballi and Mohin Dadasab Patel,29, of Madihal area in Dharwad.

The police stated that they have recovered three pistols, seven live bullets, an SUV, a moped, two motorbikes and four mobile phones from the accused.

An officer who is part of the investigation said that the investigation is continuing, and some more arrests in this case are yet to be made. They said prima facie it looks that Fruit Irfan was shot dead over a property issue. The deceased was involved in the real estate business and was a rowdy-sheeter. Old rivalry or real estate disputes may be the reason for the murder.

The police said it is still not clear who fired at Irfan, and only a detailed investigation will throw more light on it.

Irfan was shot dead on Karwar Road on August 6.

In Ludhiana in Punjab, which is where most of the bicycle manufacturing companies are based, scarcity of labourers has resulted in the firms struggling to ensure continuous supply,” he said.Shah said that, a bulk of the customers in the 20 to 50 age group were keen on purchasing premium bicycle models, while the elderly opted for the standard models. “In the urban areas, many milkmen, vegetable vendors and daily wage labourers are using bicycles,” he added.Amrut Pavaskar, partner of Born 2 Pedal, echoed Shah’s observations on the spike in the sale of bicycles. He said that his company had registered a rise in the sale of the premium models. “People are apprehensive about taking walks in the park, and the closure of gyms, swimming pools, yoga studios, et al, means that cycling is one sure way to keep fit, and so the demand for bicycles,” said Pavaskar, noting that a small section of the populace in the twin cities had taken to riding bicycles even for routine activities and carrying out of everyday chores.Owner of Lalpath Lab Collection Centre Sudhindra M, has been riding his bicycle for the past four to five years, pedalling 30km on average daily. “I use my bicycle to collect blood samples. Earlier, it cost Rs 700 in fuel every week, but I am spending only Rs 100 on fuel now. I am also keeping myself fit, and I feel much healthier. It is my contribution to the environment,” he said.",hubballi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77571175,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-191205,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/in-covid-times-bicycles-help-youngsters-stay-fit/articleshow/77566651.cms
51,['16/08/2020'],'Cardiology at Doorsteps' gets a dedicated website,"MANGALURU: Cardiology at Doorstep Foundation , an initiative led by Dr Padmanabh Kamath , professor, and HOD cardiology, KMC Mangaluru, launched its website on Saturday.

Cardiology at Doorsteps is a flagship WhatsApp group initiated by Dr Padmanabh Kamath in February 2018, to help patients in rural and remote parts of the country.

So far, about 30,000 ECGs have been posted in two Whatsapp groups and more than 5,000 heart attacks diagnosed. The group has saved more than 10,000 lives through these initiatives and has been instrumental in installing 232 ECG machines in rural health centres and Jan Aushadhi Kendras , Dr Kamath said.

Speaking TOI, Dr Kamath said, “Our mission is to save lives with the help of modern IT infrastructure and by providing medical equipment to rural areas. During this Covid pandemic, we have seen so many bizarre things happen around us. We have seen people getting alienated because of quarantine rules or isolating themselves for the fear of Covid, especially the underprivileged and the elderly patients. All this has led to greater disasters due to delay in diagnosis and treatment. With the launch of the website and with 24 hours of Cardiac helpline as an active interface, we intend to circumvent all these obstacles. I could not have launched it on a better day than our Independence Day. The whole concept of liberating our patients from dependence on others and giving them independence and freedom is our motto.”

Nearly, 2,500 members are part of the Whatsapp group that covers 20 districts of Karnataka and there are two separate groups for overseas patients and jawans. By the end of this year, the aim is to install 250 ECG machines, cover three more districts including those bordering Kerala and reach out to at least 50 lakh people.

“On Friday, we distributed Covid essentials kits to most of our CAD ECG machine donors aged above 65. Our prime concern is our senior citizens and their well-being,” Dr Kamath said.

52,['16/08/2020'],AP: Blame game begins over Swarna Palace hotel fire,"VIJAYAWADA: While the preliminary report by Krishna district joint collector has pointed fingers at Ramesh Hospitals for the fire at hotel Swarna Palace on August 9, the latter has shifted the blame to the district administration and hotel management.In an audio message released on Saturday, managing director of the hospital group P Ramesh Babu alleged that the probe into the issue is biased and targeting the hospital only. Why have the doctors, who were not even present at the time of the fire, been detained but not anyone from the hotel management, he asked.Explaining the agreement they had with Swarna Palace, he said the maintenance, housekeeping and facility management services were with hotel, while emergency medical care, doctors and nurses were the responsibility of Ramesh Hospitals.“The hotel was taken on lease as it had been used as a quarantine centre by the district administration for passengers who came from abroad. It was turned into a Covid care centre with the permission of the district medical and health officer. The district collector referred many government officials for treatment to the centre and they recovered,” he said, adding that a deliberate attempt is being made to vilify him.Ramesh Babu reiterated that the police did not arrest any one from the hotel management but have targeted the hospital management unilaterally though they had nothing to do with the unfortunate tragedy. Ramesh Hospitals was the first in the state to get fire NOC in 2012 and they have JCA certification for patient safety, he said.Meanwhile, film actor Ram Potineni has come to the defence of Ramesh Hospitals. In a series of tweets, he said a “huge conspiracy” is being hatched to show the CM of AP in bad light. “I request @ysjagan garu to look into it as some people under him might be doing this without his knowledge. This is causing huge damage to his reputation and honest approach, amongst all of us,” he tweeted.He further said that diverting the issue from fire to fees is “only to fool all of us”. He also posted screenshots of bills issued by Swarna Palace, and held the hotel management, not the doctors, responsible for the fire. In another tweet, Potineni said Swarna Palace was being run as a quarantine centre by the state government till Ramesh Hospitals took permission to turn it into a Covid care centre. “Had this fire accident taken place three weeks earlier when it was being run by the government, who would they blame?” he asked.",vijayawada,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77569665,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-696776,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/blame-game-begins-over-swarna-palace-hotel-fire/articleshow/77566541.cms
53,['16/08/2020'],Tamil Nadu: Pilot clinics to monitor patients post discharge,"Tamil Nadu health secretary J Radhakrishnan

CHENNAI: After reporting an average of 5,700 cases for the past 15 days, the state health department is now working aggressively to push the Covid-19 curve downwards. Health secretary J Radhakrishnan tells TOI the road ahead is tough, but the state’s new plans that include the new sequela clinics for treating complications in people who have recovered, wards for people who show Covid symptoms despite testing negative and micro plans for peri-urban areas, will help check the infection.

Do you think we are at the beginning of the end in the Covid-19 pandemic?

We are not seeing a huge increase in the number of fresh cases reported across the state every day. The positivity rate – number of people testing positive over the total number of people tested — is around 8% and active cases are less than 53,000. There is a plateauing in the graph, but we are continuing to test aggressively using RT-PCR. We are also encouraging people to follow the golden rules of wearing masks, social distancing and hand hygiene. We can’t drop the guard now.

Public health experts are praising the state’s decision to stick to RT-PCR for diagnosis. But doctors are saying many there are false negatives. Some of them show clinical symptoms of Covid. We don’t account for them?

Some patients admitted with severe acute respiratory infection test negative in RT-PCR. As per protocol they are not recorded as Covid-19 cases. The sensitivity of RT-PCR is just 70%. There is margin of error is up to 30%, and doctors are now finding an increase in such patients walking into hospitals. We now consider them as “clinical covid” case. We don’t just to RT-PCR on patients anymore. We look for inflammatory markers in the blood and results of chest X-ray and CT scans. If there are signs of Covid, they are admitted and treated. RT-PCR test results may be negative probably because the virus is not in the active reproductive phase. Yet symptoms are severe because the virus may have invaded several parts of the body, including lungs. We are now recording all these patients as clinical cases. Such patients are now kept and treated in isolation over the past few days across all GHs.

Doctors are also saying that many patients are returning to hospitals with complications after discharge.

That is true. This is why we have started sequela clinics at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital and Rajaji Government Hospital. Doctors here will look into residual and new symptoms in patients post discharge. Nearly 80% of the patients in Tamil Nadu have recovered from the viral infection. Many don’t completely recover from pneumonia and some return with heart attacks, strokes and life threatening clots in other parts of the body. Patients are now being asked to come back to hospitals for review if they experience any abnormal symptoms. The sequela clinics in two hospitals will be a pilot for the entire state.

While hospitals may be treating people who are discharged and those who are clinical Covid, will their deaths be recorded as Covid?

Now, protocol allows us to record patients who test positive for Covid-19 in RT-PCR to be added into the toll. But we must keep track of these people to understand the effects of the disease and its after-effects. We are telling doctors to state the cause of death clearly so they can be analysed. We have asked scientists from NIE to analyse deaths due to Covid considering overall mortality.

Why are we not able to bring down the infection rate in the state?

The positivity rate in some districts is high. Chennai, and its neighbours Tiruvallur and Chengalpet continue to report large number of cases. We see similar trends in Theni, Tenkasi, Cuddalore, Tiruvannamalai, Ranipet and Vellore. While Coimbatore is peaking, we are seeing a decline in Madurai and Virudhunagar. The dip was possible in Madurai because of aggressive testing, like in Chennai. Micro containment plans are ready for Tiruvallur and Chengalpet. As per the new plan, aggressive testing will be done in any area outside the containment zone where fresh cases are detected. This focussed testing will help isolate people early. The target given to health workers is to track and test all close contacts within 72 hours. Over time we are confident will see a downward spiral.

54,['16/08/2020'],Can blended learning bridge the digital divide?,"Representative image

VISAKHAPATNAM: The Covid-19 pandemic has severely disrupted academic activities. Academic institutions have closed down and exams have been cancelled. Some schools have shifted to online classes overnight in an attempt to make the best of a bad situation. However, the digital divide with access to technology still a far way off for large parts of the population, the online model has hit a few roadblocks.

It is in this context, Prof Nimma Venkata Rao, former dean and faculty of education at Andhra University, is conducting research on online learning at the school-level and whether it can replace the conventional classroom structure. Prof Rao’s research delves into the concept of online learning, its own rules, advantages and challenges.

“Education does not mean the mere acquisition of knowledge and experiences delivered across screens. It also means the development of habits, attitudes and skills which helps a person lead a full and worthwhile life,” said Prof Rao who has taken feedback from hundreds of parents who are concerned about their children’s education amid the pandemic.

Speaking to TOI, Prof Rao said, “A majority of parents said that their children are missing the conventional classroom structure which involves interaction with peers and teachers. However, they are still going for home schooling if not online learning owing to the pandemic.”

“But it is not wise to make 2020-21 a ‘zero academic year’ as there is a threat of dissociation with the learning process. At this juncture, a blended learning approach can serve the purpose with a scope of experiential and experimental learning,” he added.

Prof Rao, who is also a member of the committee on new education policy constituted by the Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education, stressed on the need of devising adequate and suitable curriculum and online modules. “This will be an additional burden on teachers. Every state will have to evolve its own suitable model taking logistics into consideration,” the professor said.

According to Prof Rao, Andhra Pradesh is in an advantageous position with regard to school education due to the various development schemes such as Nadu-Nedu, Amma Vodi and Gorumudda at work in the sector. “Village secretariats can be used as online (education) centres by provision of digital labs and video conferencing facility. This could become a model for other states,” Prof Venkata Rao said.

CHENNAI: After a dry spell, a system brewing over the Bay of Bengal could bring showers to the city for the next two days, say weathermen. The IMD has forecast another system likely to form over the Bay by the middle of next week, but weather enthusiasts say it may not have any effect on the Tamil Nadu coast.

The regional meteorological centre (RMC), Chennai has forecast, “Sky condition is likely to be generally cloudy. Light rain is likely to occur in some areas. Maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to be around 34C and 27C,” in the city for the next 48 hours.

For the state, the RMC has forecast light that moderate rain may to occur at isolated places.

According to meteorologists, the city is likely to get some spells due to favourable wind convergence caused by the low pressure near coastal Odisha. IMD’s regional weather inference said, “Yesterday’s well marked low pressure area over north coastal Odisha and adjoining areas of northwest Bay of Bengal and Gangetic West Bengal persists.”

The nodal weather agency has also forecast, “A fresh low pressure area is likely to form over north Bay of Bengal around August 19.”

Weather blogger Pradeep John said chances of the city getting rain is somewhat less when the monsoon is active over the northwestern regions like Gujarat, due to unfavourable wind patterns over this part of the country. “There are chances of light spells, mostly late at night or early in the morning, in the city between August 17 and 20,” he said.

While the monsoon intensity may be somewhat less in Kerala, Karnataka and parts of TN, it is likely to be active in the northwest and central parts of the country for the next 10 days, he said. “The chances of rain for us from the fresh low pressure is less because it is likely to form over north Bay of Bengal which is quite far,” he said.

64,['16/08/2020'],Getting down to the brass tacks,"CHENNAI: On July 25, after pulling off her longest zero shopping spell lasting four months, Viji Narasimhan placed herself a fat online order that left her over the moon for a whole week — two shift dresses, a pair of distressed jeans, a couple of shirts and a sexy blouse. For the 30-year-old city techie, it was a reward for ""surviving the worst months of my life and not resorting to retail therapy,"" — an addiction she’d vowed to break during lockdown.

As someone who spent her evenings ‘impulse buying’ at least thrice a week at the mall, this indeed was a feat. But what surprised Viji more is that every single garment she purchased last month comes from an online thrift store — something her fast, retail fashion-consumed soul could have never been satiated with, previously.

Viji could be representing a changing consumer dynamic in the fashion industry that several experts are predicting following the pandemic. As with any luxury goods industry, a critical need for recreating the ecosystem with ethical production, and safe, environment-friendly business practices has taken centrestage. This, alongside a sudden e-commerce boom and social media marketing, which is where most of the business takes place in the post-Covid era. Throwing light on the changing consumer behaviour, online searches examined by global fashion search platform Lyst revealed that during the pandemic months, customers looking for women’s sustainable fashion have been on the rise. It also showed a growth in consumers repairing and re-wearing what they have than buy new clothes and accessories.

""The lockdown has given us time to take a long, hard look at what we are consuming and why. This, along with the obvious financial strain, is definitely making buyers look at sustainability in a new light — both in terms of the product and how much of it they need,"" says city designer Vivek Karunakaran.

That’s why this may be a good time for homegrown brands built on the three Rs of ‘reduce, reuse and recycle’ to make their presence felt, as young city designer Sruti Ashok found out three months ago. Her Instagram thrift store, The ReLove Closet started with a charity initiative in April to raise funds for the NGO, The Kindness Foundation. ""We ended up raising `7 lakh in a month by selling pre-owned clothing, bags, shoes and accessories,"" says Sruti, who, encouraged by the response, went on to launch it as a full-fledged online store soon after. The ReLove Closet now functions under two models — a reseller model where contributors can sell their pre-loved clothing and accessories, and a donation model wherein majority of the proceeds are donated to a social cause or NGO of the contributor’s choice. Garments are washed and dry cleaned, and the packaging sanitised, before going out for delivery.

Witnessing the shift are also slow fashion advocates like Karishma Sehgal, who runs The Baksa Project, a label she started in Chennai in 2018 to repurpose her mother and grandmother’s saris into clothes for herself. She has also been advocating conscious fashion by educating people to cherish old clothes by mending them with creative tailoring or embroidery. ""I’ve had at least 15 people reach out to me to learn these techniques, and am contemplating holding upcyling workshops online,"" says Karishma, who works out of Pune now.

Labels like Karunakaran’s are also adopting innovative ways to retain the integral experiential, ‘touch and feel’ characteristic of luxury retail, without compromising on safety. The designer has tied up with Hyatt Regency to open a studio space for his brand, ‘Viia by Vivek Karunakaran’, in one of its suites, where customers will be met strictly on appointment and the space sanitized every few hours.

Not only would this reduce overhead expenditure but it would also avoid crowding, while ensuring every customer is attended to, says the designer, who is also reinventing the brand to focus on high-end staples rather than occasional wear. ""Instead of cocktail gowns, suits and jackets, we’re looking at garments people would go back to every day, like linen shirts and shorts. We’re also trying to eliminate excess raw material by planning ahead, and doing away with plastic packaging wherever we can,"" he says.

Bigger brands across the country are also seriously looking at circular fashion and reducing their carbon footprint. Designer Anita Dongre has been working towards empowering traditional artisans and evaluating vendors and partnerships by their carbon-neutrality. The pandemic has shifted the way fashion seasons will be shown in the future, says popular designer Payal Jain. ""It is time to merge seasonal collections into a simple format, with comfort, practicality, versatile usage and long term sustainability as prime concerns for the future, be it for the creators of fashion brands or the consumers,"" she says.

PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Saturday said policymakers will adopt all of Goa’s 191 villages panchayats and 14 municipalities, including the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP), by October 2 to make them self-sufficient with an economic revival plan.

The directorate of higher education (DHE) and Goa Institute of Public Administration and Rural Development (GIPARD) have submitted a report on steps to take to make the civic bodies self-sufficient. The study was carried out under the state executive committee and Disaster Management Act.

Sawant said that the report has looked at cleanliness and beautification, maintaining of cultural heritage, developmental and ecological balance, civic and academic education to all, employment, entrepreneurship and opportunity, health living, time-bound service, people partnership, good governance, improving the happiness portion self-reliance in village panchayats and municipalities “Policymakers (colleges and various departments) will visit these villages and adopt them by October 2. Based on the potential of the village, they will be made self-sufficient,” he said.

Sawant congratulated DHE and GIPARD for the report.

“This report will give directions on how Goa will move ahead in the coming days. It will help the state to make villages and municipalities self-sufficient on the lines of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Atmanirbhar Bharat,” he said.

A senior officer said that during the course of interaction with teachers, villagers sought packages for revival of their businesses in the form of tax concessions and a loan waiver scheme.

DHE and GIPARD had been tasked with surveying all civic bodies, so that a detailed economic revival plan could be drawn up for the state.

The idea was to analyse the potential for revival of sectors related to agriculture, animal husbandry, fishing, horticulture, tourism, MSME, traditional means of livelihood and the employment potential in each individual village.

67,['16/08/2020'],Temples’ coffers dry up in Telangana,"Temples struggle to pay priests

HYDERABAD: Temples of Telangana are feeling the Covid-19 heat. With revenues falling due to low turnout of devout in view of the pandemic, several temples are seeking the state government’s hand-holding to survive.

Yadadri, one of the major temples in the state, earned Rs 20 crore less in the last four months from its normal income, forcing the temple management to meet the expenditure from its reserve funds. “Yadadri temple had earned Rs 110 crore in 2019-20. Since April this year, there is a deficit of Rs 20 crore,” temple executive officer N Geetha told STOI.

The famed Sri Sita Ramachandraswamy temple has been down and out ever since the boat tragedy near Papikondalu last year. “After the tragedy, boats have been stopped and devotees from AP are not coming. The Covid-19 pandemic has spelt doom on the temple revenues further,” a senior endowments official said.

Endowments officials said the plight of nearly 670 temples, which survive on hundi collections, is worse. A majority of temples are not only struggling to pay salaries to priests and other employees but also finding it hard to conduct daily rituals to the deities. The temples, which were shut from mid-March to June first week, reopened on June 8 but devotees are few. The situation is such that all the temples have stopped arjitha sevas and started offering online puja services.

Vemulawada temple in Sircilla district earlier received over 10,000 devotees a day. “But now, hardly a 1,000 devotees have darshan of the lord,” in-charge EO D Krishna Prasad explained. The second biggest temple in the state is now finding it difficult to pay salaries to about 450 employees. “We may have to withdraw our FDs of Rs 30 crore,” he said. The temple’s annual income is Rs 80 crore. “Since April, the temple earned only Rs 5 crore revenue. Worse still, the staff salary bill alone is Rs 2 crore a month,” the EO explained.

Kondagattu temple in Jagtial district is facing a severe financial crunch. Though its annual income is around Rs 14 crore, management of the Anjaneya Swamy temple had to withdraw Rs 2 crore towards payment of salaries to staff. “We are trying to meet the regular expenditure from the sale of prasadams like laddu and pulihora,” an official said.

Officials said the endowments department’s woes are far from over. “From Rs 330 crore earnings in the last financial year, our income has fallen to less than Rs 30 crore,” an official rued.

68,['16/08/2020'],Goa: Feast at Raj Bhavan chapel low-key with invitees only,"The feast mass was recorded and uploaded on YouTube

PANAJI: The annual morning mass held at the 500-year-old Raj Bhavan chapel on the occasion of the Feast of the Assumption of Mary was restricted to invitees and staff only this year due to the pandemic.

“This had to be done due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The people of Goa have been very cooperative and watched the mass online instead of visiting the chapel. Next year, hopefully if the situation improves, we can open the place to devotees again,” secretary to governor, Rupesh Kumar Thakur told TOI.

Rosario Rodrigues, a resident of Marivel , Dona Paula, who attends the feast mass every year said that he watched it online this year. “With even Sunday mass suspended across churches we couldn’t expect to be allowed at the Raj Bhavan for the feast mass,” Rodrigues said.

During the annual feast on August 15, people from different walks of life attend the mass at the chapel, which is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, under the invocation of Nossa Senhora do Cabo.

The feast mass could not be live-streamed. The technical team recorded the mass and then uploaded it on YouTube.

“The Raj Bhavan staff is usually in charge of making arrangements for the devotees’ welcome. Hindu and Muslim staffers also believe in the power of ‘Our Lady’ and help out with tasks with enthusiasm,” sources said.

“The pandol, which is erected for devotees to have refreshments after the mass, was not put up this year. Also, there was no stall set up for the traditional ‘khajekar’ to sell ‘kadio-bodio’ as part of the feast,” sources said.

A flight of stairs from the chapel leads to a grotto within which is the altar dedicated to St Paula. Each year, the feast day sees devotees from from the nearby villages forming a serpentine queue at the grotto to seek the saint’s blessings.

“Hundreds of people would line up every year at the grotto to seek blessings. But this year, there was no queue,” sources said.

Besides the annual feast held at the chapel, the chapel is open to the public only for Christmas, Easter and morning mass on Sundays.

Other flat owners are worried about how to handle the situation. Do we need to sanitize the common spaces like rooftops and elevators? There is no one to guide us.”Residents say they are worried because the government was earlier demarcating localities with many Covid-19 patients into containment zones. But in case of complexes, there are no restrictions apart from the specific flats where Covid-19 patients are housed.Doctors, however, have categorically stated that there is no reason to panic and that neighbours should help Covid-19 patients in home isolation while ensuring that they do not come into physical contact with them.Visakhapatnam-based surgeon, Dr Alok Mazumdar said, “Don’t make any physical contact with Covid-19 patients until they test negative. Otherwise, you can move around your complex freely. There is no reason to panic.”According to health department guidelines, asymptomatic patients and those with mild symptoms can stay in home isolation along with caregivers and relatives in the same house. In fact, AP was among the first states to allow home isolation when a family of three tested positive for Covid-19 in East Godavari on May 23.Dr J Sudhakar said, “If a patient staying in a complex tests positive then common spaces should be sanitized.

71,['16/08/2020'],Delhi: SDMC to e-auction shops lying vacant to generate funds,"South Delhi Municipal Corporation

NEW DELHI: To increase its revenue, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has finalised a policy for e-auctioning of shops lying vacant for a long time. Most of these shops are located in central and south zones at places like Lodhi Road, RK Puram and MB Road.

The civic agency has reduced their rentals and decided to lease them at Rs 56-Rs 70 per sq feet or existing market rate, whichever is higher.

“The vacant shops can be e-auctioned on the basis of auctions held for nearby similar shops in the same market and therefore, the minimum reserve price of Rs 70 per sq feet may be fixed for auctioning of shops in central and south zone. In case, the rates for nearby shops are not available with the department then the rates of Delhi Development Authority, may be adopted. Likewise, the minimum reserve price for shops in the west zone may be fixed at Rs 56 per sq feet,” the proposal said.

The terms and conditions for leasing out these shops have been decided by a committee headed by additional commissioner, land and estate, AA Tazir. There are over 110 such shops/stalls, which will be open for e-auction and the committee has recommended fixing a ceiling of allotting a maximum of two shops or units to one person on licence basis.

A senior SDMC official said, “Despite being at prominent places, some shops have been lying vacant since long and their condition is dilapidated and renovation, if any, is to be made by the highest bidder.”

The shop will be licensed for 10 years from the date of commencement of licence deed on monthly fee payment basis. After getting allotment of the shop, the licensee cannot contest thereafter and complain that the licensed public premise is not complete in any respect. If any internal changes are required, he/she can do it at own cost after obtaining prior written permission, as stated in the proposal. Also, the shops cannot be transferred to other people.

Her guru, legendary musician M L Vasanthakumari (MLV) helped her master not just the seven notes but also the culinary arts. That’s why, when the lockdown extended, Sudha decided to regale her rasikas by launching her own show, Sooda’s Kitchen, wherein she dishes out delicious food to the beat of her own music.

Clad in a brown kanjeevaram, and adorned with minimal jewellery, Sudha stands over the stove, stirring Neelgiri dum aloo while singing a ‘thillana’ she created for the occasion. ""I created one with ‘dum, dum’ in it just for fun,"" says Sudha, who launched the show on her YouTube channel, Simply Sudha, during the lockdown.

""When the national lockdown was announced, I enjoyed the downtime doing things I loved. But, when it got extended, I realised this would not end soon,"" says Sudha, adding that her son Kaushik, encouraged her to try out things online. ""People were getting panicky and anxious with all the uncertainty. And I wanted to give something back to the audience. A singer reaches a certain stature only when you get acknowledgement and appreciation from the audience,"" says Sudha.

And that’s how Sooda’s Kitchen — named after her mother Choodamani, better known as Chooda, and herself — was born. ""When I was with MLV amma, who loved cooking, she would instruct me how to make various dishes. She would say there is a strong connection between cooking and doing a concert — just like you cook with different ingredients, a concert has several elements such as swaram, ragam, compositions, how you connect to an audience,"" says Sudha. ""You are preparing a concert to serve to the audience.""

She chooses the dishes and music, with care. ""I go by the sound of the name of the recipe or find some connection between the two,"" says Sudha, who has done eight episodes so far. For instance, when she made cashew or mundiri pakoda, she sang Mandhari Begada raga. ""When I made a saptaswara cutlet with seven veggies, I sang the Sobhillu saptaswara, a composition of saint Thyagaraja, and another of his songs, which had the word ‘saptaswara’ in it,"" says Sudha. ""When I made mullangi chappati, I sang a raga called Lathangi to rhyme with it.""

And her fans have been loving it, with some of her videos getting more than one lakh views. ""They try out the dishes also and tell me how it turns out,"" says Sudha, who plans to bring out more episodes. ""I do it when I am inspired; suddenly the dish and the raga to go with it just lights up in my mind""

GITP said that quick implementation through a single-window system will help improve rural connectivity.

GITP president Gurudev Naik said that earlier policies meant to improve the state failed due to a “lackadaisical approach” to implementation. “Only time-bound implementation through the much touted single-window-system will have the desired impact and help the citizenry in these most difficult times,” said Naik.

Over a month earlier, an IT professional had strung up a portable modem on a tree for better signals and the video of the incident was widely circulated. With the pandemic , all sectors shifted to work from home (WFH), but the lack of reliable overground and underground telecom infrastructure has affected productivity.

A few weeks earlier, Goa technology association said that productivity of Goan IT companies has plummeted due to poor internet services.

“Despite starting in 2007 and opting for a supposedly robust public private partnership-based, Goa Broad Band Network (GBBN) as opposed to state wide area network (SWAN), majority of the state is still struggling with connectivity woes,” said Naik.

CHENNAI: The Covid-19 pandemic has brought with it several challenges and some new opportunities too like the resuscitation of virtual labs project of the ministry of human resources development that had remained moribund for almost a decade. Though online classes have started, professional colleges were unable to conduct experiments without opening their labs to students.

The virtual labs project, which allows students to do their experiments remotely by using cloud computing, will also help them access video lectures, demonstrations and reference books. “Virtual labs are like simulators. All engineering experiments except chemical and biotech ones can be done in virtual mode,” said Sandeep Sancheti, vice-chancellor, SRMIST. The labs are essentially graphical front-end working in synchronization with a back-end consisting of a simulation-engine running on a server or actual measurement data or a remotely-triggered experiment. “Virtual labs are safer and better for experimentation.

The students are doing experiments individually instead of groups where one or two will do the experiments and others will just measure the readings,” he said. The virtual experiments can be done 24x7 instead of four or five hours in the regular mode. “Many institutes can come together and offer virtual experiments to their students to make it affordable. There is no limit for the number of attempts and they will get access to high-end equipment,” he added.

He further said virtual labs can lead to virtual education and universities. “There are many tools for online classes and exams. If we develop effective virtual labs, it would give final push to establishing virtual universities,” Sancheti said.

“We are sensitizing our staff to virtual experiments. We will allow our students to do virtual experiments from next week,” said RM Kishore, vice-chairman, RMK Engineering College.

Students have to do 12 to 15 experiments per lab course in a semester. The virtual experiments will cover most of the experiments.

“A student would get just one chance in a physical lab experiment. He or she can get a chance to do multiple experiments. It is free of cost. Anybody can join and access the website and do the experiments. At present, we are giving it as value-addition,” he added.

“In the present situation when students are not able to come to colleges and do physical experiments, virtual labs would offer them help. These labs can develop the curiosity of students. It will play an important role even after Covid,” said M K Surappa, vice-chancellor, Anna University.

National Institute of Technology, Karnataka in Surathkal is one of the pioneers in setting up virtual labs. Many TN institutions have already approached the NITK for setting up and accessing virtual labs.

Due to this, large number of migrant labourers, along with their families and children, have returned to their native places and are likely to stay there for varying periods.

Such children, who have left, may be shown separately in enrolment as temporarily unavailable or migrated. While all care must be taken to ensure that their names are not struck off the rolls (as the possibility of their return anytime is always there), their numbers may be reported class-wise to the DoE to compensate for any input costs to be incurred by the school such as mid-day meals, distribution of textbooks and uniforms if not already completed,” the education ministry said in its guidelines.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77571090,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1119384,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/data-on-migrant-students-to-ensure-education-continuity/articleshow/77567798.cms

This, they said will not benefit Goans or the state.

“Any observer, including BJP, needs to be clear that destruction does not equate development of the state and is a fallacy unless ‘the state’ now means ‘wealthy individuals and selected business interests ’,” the group stated in its pressnote.

It is fundamentally clear that this destruction will benefit industrial interests that will maximise profit with no safety nets to the well-being of Goans, the group said in its pressnote.

“Around 150 scientists and tourism experts have called for Cumulative Impact Assessment study to understand the impacts of all three of these projects, that the BJP spokesperson has deemed as ‘well-studied’,” they stated.

Until such a cumulative assessment is made, there cannot even be an implication that the projects are “well studied”, the group claimed.

“The statement that Goa has no potential to generate electricity, shows that the state government has paid no attention to advances being made in the rest of India. In the last eighteen months itself, power generation has exceeded demand, with peak power shortage being 0.7%,” the group stated.

CHENNAI: The Centre should enact a law prohibiting candidates with criminal background from participating in elections, the Madras high court has observed.

“It is reported that persons with criminal backgrounds are becoming policy makers in many parts of the country. It has to be prevented and the system has to be cleansed. This is possible only if the top leaders of political parties are firm in not admitting criminals in their political parties. The leaders should have a vision for decriminalisation of politics ,” a division bench of Justice N Kirubakaran and Justice VM Velumani said.

Citing a 2019 report of Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), the court said, “The report reveals that 43% (233 out of 539) of elected MPs are facing criminal cases. Of which 29% (159 MPs) have serious criminal cases pending against them.”

Therefore, the central government has to come out with a comprehensive legislation to prohibit persons with criminal background from contesting elections to parliament, state legislatures and local bodies as observed by the Constitutional bench of the Supreme Court in Public Interest Foundation and others Vs Union of India case, the court added. The judges made the observations while hearing a habeas corpus petition challenging detention of Janarthanan under the Puducherry Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act. According to the detention order, the accused faces 19 criminal cases for alleged offences including murder and attempt to murder.

Recording the same, the court said, it is evident from media reports that criminal elements in Puducherry have close connection and support of political parties. Political parties are having criminals as their members and also office-bearers.

“It is brought to the notice of this court that many cases pending against the detenu are in connection with inter-gang rivalries and in which country made bombs are used to murder opposite gang members,” the bench said.

Pointing out the delay in probing the cases, the judges said, this would speak about his clout with political parties, especially ruling parties and police. But for political interference, police would have filed charge sheets, the court added.

“It is appearing in the media that rowdy gangs are operated by many politicians, communal and religious leaders throughout the country. There seems to be a syndicate between the police force, political leaders and rowdy gangs and hence, the safety and security of the people are jeopardised,” the court said.

The bench then suo motu impleaded DGP of Puducherry as party respondent and directed to file a report as to the number of such persons accommodated in political parties, and the status of such pending criminal cases in the union territory.

Also, many citizens and students wrote to chief minister Pramod Sawant on the occasion of Independence Day to raise their concerns over the projects.

Citizens in different parts of Goa created a human chain as a way of protesting against the projects to which approvals have been granted by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (Moefcc). “As our representative, we hope that today serves as a good reminder to reflect the aspiration of Goans from across the state, a very important one being protecting our ecology and biodiversity . Almost 16 different representations have been sent to the National Board for Wildlife, Central Empowered Committee and your office. This includes 150 tourism stakeholders , the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa to more than a 100 architects and 700+ students,” citizens said in their letter to the CM.

Students created a virtual human chain by standing in front of a tree or at a favourite green spot and sharing it on social media.

Nine-year-old, Taleigao-based, Jake Dias, said, “It is important to fight the Mollem campaign as our wildlife will be destroyed forever and our birds will have no home.”

Many musicians also came forward to rally around the forest through their own Earthsongs for Mollem. Ponda based, Jyotsna Dessai student of MSc Zoology, said, “When you visit a place like Molem, even once, you are bound to form a connection with it and I feel that there is no better tool than music to portray this bond.”

“The economy of the state is in turmoil and expecting parents to pay high fees during this difficult time is next to impossible,” said Mulla.

He said that because of financial constraints, many students are willing to drop out of college, which will in turn affect education and put the future of the state at stake.

“Considering the financially weaker students, NSUI strongly demands for a fee waiver for all students who cannot afford fees during this difficult time, failing which NSUI will sit on a hunger strike on August 17,” said Mulla.

NSUI had also submitted a plea to governor Satya Pal Malik seeking a waiver of school and college fees because the Covid pandemic has affected the ability of parents to pay the academic fees.

The centre released a video as part of Independence Day celebrations where in the woman was seen taking up her first physiotherapy session with the new prosthetic leg.

The woman’s ankle was severely damaged due to uncontrolled and severe diabetes. She lost her ability to walk after her heel bone on left leg was removed a year ago. One of her toes too was removed.

Director of orthopedic institute at CMCH Dr Vetrivelchezhian said, “The artificial limb centre was set up to ensure all our amputees get the ‘independence’ to perform their own functions and duties and return to work. The woman’s measurements were taken last week, and we created a mould for her prosthetic leg. Once we were satisfied with the mould, we then created the prosthetic using polypropylene, the most sought-after material for light weight calipers. On Friday, it was prepared and ready for a fitting.”

The limb centre planned to discharge the woman only once she is able to walk comfortably without a walker.

Stating that the woman worked at a mill for Rs 250 a day, CMCH dean Dr P Kalidas said, “We want her to get back to work or at least find another comfortable job that pays her a good salary. The 10-bedded artificial limb centre that was recently inspected by health minister Dr C Vijaya Baskar and local administration minister S P Velumani, now has at least 10 amputees, who lost their limbs over the last one year. We plan to create limbs for them. For now, we will focus on fitting lower limbs and then move to upper limbs.”

The hospital has at least 10 patients undergoing amputation due to accidents or diabetes every month.

“After we amputate them, patients go home and are completely dependent on their families,” said Dr S Vetrivelchezhian.

The district disability welfare department and district social welfare department does give amputees prosthetics under the state scheme for artificial limbs, but they have provided limbs for only 50 to 60 people so far because it depends on fund allotment.

""Getting an artificial limb in our centre requires no submission of extra documents. The limb creation and physiotherapy are covered under the Chief Minister's Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme. We received Rs 50 lakh as reimbursements from the scheme for the many surgeries we performed,"" he added.

89,['16/08/2020'],"Not testing brought-dead, kin can be disastrous, say experts","Coimbatore: The state government’s decision not to test people, who are declared brought dead to hospitals, for Covid-19 has evoked mixed reactions from epidemiologists and doctors.

In the district, 15 people were found positive for the virus after death. They were all patients who were brought dead to hospitals.

District collector K Rajamani said, “Though we don’t have exact numbers, at least 30%-40% of these cases were earlier treated in private hospitals and referred to government hospitals after their survival chances dropped to nil. There are also instances of bringing patients to hospitals too late.”

TOI has data showing that another 40 Covid-19 patients had died within 24 hours of hospitalization.

Earlier, samples were collected from the body of a brought-dead patient for Covid-19 testing and the body was either cremated by city corporation officials or given for deep burial, and not handed over to the family members, if according to kin the deceased had flu-like symptoms and acute respiratory illness. But with changed regulations, while the body would be packed as in the case of a positive fatality, that would be handed over to the family.

Dr G Ramesh Kumar, deputy director of public health, said, “We will closely monitor the family and ensure more than 20 people are not attending the funeral. If they develop symptoms, they will be tested. We are only following the central government’s policy not to test people who are brought dead.”

Many epidemiologists with the health department fear that the state has taken this decision to reduce the number of Covid-19 deaths on paper. In the district alone, this would bring down the death numbers by 10%.

An official, who requested anonymity, said, “There has been a lot of pressure on the health department to bring down death numbers or provide reasons for the spike. However, the move to stop testing people who are brought dead, especially if they had flu-like symptoms or SARI symptoms, could lead to spread of virus.”

The official says a brought-dead Covid-19 patient must have infected at least two close family members, who might remain asymptomatic. “Once the body is returned to them, the family will conduct a funeral that is likely to be attended by at least 30 people. Another 100 people might visit them in batches of five or 10 daily. Those leading funeral rites might also get infected. It could have disastrous consequences.”

Less than two months ago, a 77-year-old communist party member from Velandipalayam was brought to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) with severe breathlessness. He died a few hours later. Doctors collected two samples of sputum from his chest, one before death and after death. As both the samples tested positive for the virus, authorities screened his family and contacts, and found his wife and three of his associates were infected.

In Jothipuram too, a woman was tested positive for the virus after her father, who was declared brought dead to CMCH, found to be infected.

There are many cases of funerals becoming Covid-19 transmission points, including in the Nilgiris.

Experts too say when the district is in the surge phase, it would be advisable to test at least the family members of the brought-dead patient. Dr K Kolandaswamy, former director of public health, said, “In the case of brought-dead patients who had SARI symptoms, the family members, especially who attended to the patients, must be tested.”

While daily cases being recorded at the Indira Gandhi International Airport are around 10% of what they used to be, the ‘carriers’ are not trained men and women, but instead, migrants who cannot afford to purchase airline ticket Customs officials said in several cases, they found labourers and people from the lower economic strata being used to smuggle gold or drugs in exchange for an airline ticket, with the smugglers promising them a journey to their hometown.In order to avoid arrests, the gold is being distributed to several such ‘carriers’ so that neither is carrying more than 1kg. “In a recent case, 11 people were caught, each carrying less than 1kg of gold and while the gold was seized, only large recoveries can lead to an arrest. So in many cases, while a case is made against the labourers, there are no arrests as the amount is so little,” a Customs official told TOI.The officer stated that while passenger profiling is generally done for smugglers coming out of certain regions, like Rajasthan and Kerala, no such recoveries has been made upon the resumption of commercial flight operations.“The usual modus operandi would be concealing the gold in the rectum, or even turning it into gold-coloured paste. All these methods are not coming through at the Delhi airport, which is an indicator that the regular channels in terms of experienced carriers is yet to resume,” said the official, adding that those caught smuggling gold over the past two months have generally been bringing them in their luggage.On August 6, two men were apprehended at IGI, trying to smuggle gold bars weighing 466 grams from Riyadh. Later in the same week, four more men were apprehended bringing in gold biscuits, weighing around 800 grams.“The profiling of the men showed that generally, those arriving in with the gold had no prior experience and therefore were not concealing it in the rectum or using ingenious ways. It appears that they are promised a ticket journey in exchange for smuggling gold, where they are instructed to hand it over to another person at the airport,” the official added.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77569885,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-306254,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ticket-to-home-labourers-made-gold-carriers/articleshow/77567223.cms

93,['16/08/2020'],"As land prices spike, so do bribe amounts","Hyderabad: Keesara tehsildar EB Nagaraju on Friday night was caught by ACB sleuths taking a bribe of Rs 1.10 crore. The bribe was offered in connection with a land in Rampally Dayara in Keesara mandal in favour of some persons and a real estate agency.

ACB officials said two businessmen offered the bribe to the tehsildar to issue the proceedings of the land and start developing it. Medchal-Malkajgiri district officials said an acre of land now costs Rs 20 crore and this could be the reason the businessmen offered him Rs 1.10 crore to settle the row over 28 acres.

This was only the tip of the iceberg of land litigations. Sources said skyrocketing land prices in Hyderabad and surrounding areas have become a major source of cash flow to some of the revenue employees. At least half a dozen major cases reported in the city and surrounding areas in the last one year have revenue officials caught in the web of bribery and land litigations.

A senior revenue official pointed out more complaints had started coming after the government initiated the land records updation programme (LRUP) in 2016 and Rythu Bandhu scheme. Due to high land rates, there is competition among the officers to bag plum postings like tehsildar in Rangareddy and Medchal districts. A majority of them get postings with the purported blessings of politicians, sources said.

A case in point: Nagaraju, who began his career as a junior assistant in the revenue department , continued to function in RR district despite rising through the ranks and expanded his network of operations.

“The entire department (revenue) is getting a bad name following the actions of a handful of officers, especially those working in Hyderabad and erstwhile RR districts. We have represented to the state several times to transfer field-level officers in the erstwhile RR district. But, our pleas have fallen on deaf ears,” Vanga Ravinder Reddy, president of Telangana Revenue Employees’ Services Association (TRESA), told STOI.

Interestingly, there was no let-up in the bribery cases involving revenue officers even after CM K Chandrasekhar Rao made no bones about the growing corruption in the department. “The fact that the department is being revamped, including a merger with the panchayat raj department shows the government’s seriousness in putting an end to corruption,” an official said.

Last year, ACB had come out with a list of ‘most corrupt’ departments based on the number of cases registered. The revenue department had the dubious distinction of topping the charts, followed by the municipal administration and home (police) department.

COIMBATORE: Days after the University Grants Commission (UGC) told the Supreme Court that states cannot override its direction to hold end-semester exams for final year students within September 30, student bodies in the district on Saturday reiterated their demand to cancel final year exams, stating conducting the same amid the pandemic would be a risky affair.

Dhinesh Raja, district secretary, Students Federation of India, said results were crucial for final year students as they had to decide on taking up higher studies or jobs. “Many students are in their hometowns doing part-time jobs. If exams are held during the lockdown, which is extended till this month-end, how would they reach their colleges and exam halls?”

Pointing out that states were presently dealing with different kinds of issues, he said it was unfair for the UGC to ask them to hold exams now. “Kerala, for instance, is dealing with rain and landslide issues. Tamil Nadu is trying to contain the Covid-19 spread. How can states hold end-semester exams amid these issues? If final year exams must be held, they could be allowed conduct the same after the pandemic subsides.”

PANAJI: Heavy rainfall that has been lashing parts of the state since Friday is expected to continue on Sunday.

The India meteorological department (IMD) had attributed the reason for the showers to the formation of a low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal, which intensified on Saturday.

“The formation over the Bay of Bengal is currently in the stage of a well marked low pressure area, owing to which the windspeed has increased over Goa and so has the rainfall activity. The intensity of rainfall is likely to reduce from August 17 onwards after the well marked area dissipates,” IMD scientist, Rahul M said.

IMD had earlier warned of heavy rainfall and issued an orange alert from August 14-16.

There are chances of another low pressure likely to form above the Bay of Bengal by August 19, but its development and impact of rainfall over Goa are being monitored by IMD. “The impact of that system is not showing very significantly right now but we can expect some increase in rainfall by August 19 depending on its intensity. IMD will have a clearer picture about this phenomenon by August 17.” Rahul M said.

The lab is functioning in the building belonging to the public health department and the space is not adequate, the experts said. Though a team of forensic experts met district revenue officer Ramadurai Murugan a few weeks ago seeking land for a new facility, the district administration was ready to provide only one acre near Sulur, they said.

“The government should allot the land at Thomas Park in Race Course belonging to the Tamil Nadu Housing Board. We don’t need money from the state government as the Union government is ready to provide more than 100 crore to set up a lab, which will function round-the-clock,” an expert told TOI. “The new facility will be able to analyse DNA samples. Now, DNA retrieved from samples is analyzed in the Chennai forensic lab. We can also set up a training centre to train judicial and police officers. The facility will also house staff quarters and have rooms for trainees.”

Sleuths of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), Central Bureau of Investigation and National Investigation Agency had visited the lab at Race Course, the expert said. “RAW officials visited the lab two weeks ago to discuss about the death of Sri Lankan gangster Angoda Lokka.”

The lab started functioning at Race Course in 1974. It has seven divisions. The main division is toxicology, which analyses internal organs like liver and kidneys, and urine and blood. Toxicology experts can detect presence of poisonous substances like pesticides and insecticides. The lab result is given to courts within five days. The lab receives 2,000 viscera every month in connection with cases in Coimbatore, Nilgiris, Tirupur and Erode.

The prohibition division can analyze illicit liquors including arrack and toddy. The narcotics division can analyze only ganja, not drugs like ketamine, heroin or opium. The biology division can trace blood and semen stain on clothes and weapons, and also hair, saliva and diatom. The serology division can identify animal blood, human blood and bird blood. The computer division can retrieve audio, video and image files from mobile phones and computers. The division is rendering assistance to CBI, NIA and crime branch -CID police. The excise division can analyze and certify liquor made in three distilleries in western Tamil Nadu.

COLVA: Two unusually large tar balls measuring 1.5ft in length and 1ft in height have washed up on the Benaulim beach.

It is normal to find small tar balls deposited on Goa’s beaches, especially just before the onset of monsoon and thereon till October. Former scientist from National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), Antonio Mascarenhas said that it could be that smaller units got aggregated on the sea bed before being pushed and transported by the waves. The tar balls need rapid analysis for correct interpretation, he said.

Tar balls are lumps of solidified crude oil found in or on the sea that get washed ashore. According to experts, tar ball pollution has severe consequences not only on the scenic beauty of beaches, but also to marine life.

Another ex-NIO scientist, Virupaxa Banakar, said that tar balls on beaches are the result of washing off of crude oil on open oceans. They are indicative of oil spills and are hazardous to marine and beach environment.

The layer of oil that forms on seawater undergoes physical and chemical alteration called weathering before it finally washes up and get deposited on beaches as sticky black lumps or balls.

“We plan to use the service of a Tirupur-based expert for voice analysis as the government has not appointed staff for the lab,” said an official. Currently, voice analysis is done at the forensic science lab in Chennai.

During the visit of the President, Prime Minister and chief minister, food samples are tested at the laboratory. But it lacks the national accreditation board for testing and calibration laboratories’ accreditation.

“Our results are accurate and reliable. Recently, the Rajasthan forest department sent us samples collected from a tiger carcass to detect presence of poisonous substances,” the official said. “We can also collect DNA from fingerprints.”

The state does the highest number of RT-PCR tests in the country and maintains a high recovery rate.In his Independence Day speech, the fourth in a row at Fort St George, Palaniswami said the government was taking efforts on a war-footing by following proper procedures, “honestly and truthfully,” to rescue the people from coronavirus. “Certainly, the government will stand by the people forever.

As a result, 4.11 lakh acres have seen kuruvai cultivation,” the chief minister said proudly. The state government also enacted in February a legislation to protect Cauvery basin agricultural zone, to prevent hazardous industries from setting shop there. The state realized 100tonnes of food grain production for six years in a row.The state government has allotted Rs 700 crore for Cauvery-Gundar river link scheme, and was implementing several water resources programmes, including Athikadavu-Avinashi scheme and Tamirabarani-Karumeniyar-Nambiyar interlink, the CM said.

The loan was obtained to also pay dues to TSRTC Credit Cooperative Society and towards remission of pending dues to the provident fund account of the employees.A senior official admitted that Telangana State Road Transport Corporation had no choice but to utilise the loan amount to make salary payments to the employees as there was no income to the corporation in April and May due to total lockdown.

112,['16/08/2020'],Kallar tribes protest seeking land at alternative location in ATR,"Coimbatore: Twenty-three Kallar tribes families, who were moved from their settlement in the Anaimalai Tiger Reserve (ATR) after heavy rain and landslips last year, protested at Theppakulamedu on Saturday urging officials to provide them land for housing in new location. All the 23 families are currently residing in six houses in the quarters of tea workers at Thaimudi estate near Valparai.

Over 50 people staged the agitation holding placards. They demanded land at Theppakulamedu, which is three kilometres away from their previous settlement. About ten people from Udumanparai settlement also joined the protest extending support to the protesters.

The Kallar tribes were originally nomadic farmers inside the ATR. Some decades ago, they settled at a piece of land which they named as Kallar settlement. They were cultivating pepper in the surrounding areas and during off seasons, they collected honey and weaved bags from forest-based products for their livelihood.

“In August 2019, our houses were damaged due to heavy rain and landslips that followed. When we attempted to construct straw huts, officials stopped us and assured us to provide us an alternative location within ten days. Until then we shifted to quarters of tea estate workers at Thaimudi estate,” said S Anish Kumar, 23, one of the protesters.

“We have been attending multiple meetings and selected Theppakulamedu as a place for our new settlement. Theppakulamedu will suitable for our lifestyle. But nothing has happened on the ground,” Anish said.

Another protester Jayalakshmi Jeyapal, 30, said with our farmland inside the forest, it has been difficult to travel to the settlement on daily basis to look after the crops. “Besides, due to practical problems, we stopped collecting honey. While we are struggling to sustain financially, the estate management has been repeatedly asking us to vacate the houses in its quarters.”

When contacted, an official from ATR said, “As per the Forest Rights Act, title deed could be given only to tribal families that had been residing in a piece of land in the forest for three generations (75 years) prior to December 2005. Accordingly, we had prepared title deeds for the families at the Kallar settlement and forwarded it to the district administration.”

“It is violation of the act to give title deed for the alternative location that the families were seeking as it was occupied only this year,” the official said, adding, “However, if the families insist on deed for the new location, we could forward their resolution passed at their committee level seeking deeds for Theppakulamedu to our superiors for consideration.”

113,['16/08/2020'],Hubballi: Spartan ceremonies mark Independence Day celebrations,"Children in Hubballi soak in the patriotic fervour on India’s 74th Independence Day.

HUBBALLI: Although it was a ceremony stripped of frills and pageantry, the Independence Day celebrations held at Nehru Ground in Hubballi on Saturday amid the Covid-19 crisis, was certainly not lacking in either patriotic zeal or fervour.

The absence of children, who have for long been an integral part of the Independence Day celebrations, was conspicuous on Saturday, since the fear of the pandemic had prompted the government to decide against their participation.

Hubballi tahsildar Shashidhar Madayal unfurled the Tricolour at Nehru Ground, and was offered the guard of honour. Although there was no parade, a group of teachers rendered patriotic songs to mark the occasion. Paying tribute to the martyrs, the sacrifice of whom helped India cast off the shackles of imperialism, Madayal called on people to throw themselves into nation building.

The tahsildar also listed some of the government’s marquis initiatives, and called on people to avail of the benefits of schemes. He said that, as many as 1,47,719 families with either antodaya or BPL cards had been given rice, wheat, pulses and kerosene during the lockdown.

Covid-19 warriors honoured

In Ballari, Karnataka forest minister BS Anand Singh unfurled the National Flag, which was hoisted at a height of 150m at the Rotary Circle in Hospete. The event was witnessed by a large crowd. Healthcare personnel and others who had served as frontline Covid-19 warriors were honoured on the occasion for staking their life in the battle against the pandemic.

Creation of jobs, infrastructure development top priorities: Shivaram Hebbar

In Karwar , Uttara Kannada district in-charge minister Shivaram Hebbar, who unfurled the National Flag at the Police Parade Ground, on Saturday outlined his two-pronged vision for the coastal district: Generating employment and upscaling infrastructure in the district.

Emphasising his commitment to ensuring the overall development of Uttara Kannada, Hebbar said that he was keen on heralding an era of prosperity in the district by developing ports, agriculture, tourism and fishing. He said that development of all sectors would generate direct and indirect employment opportunities for thousands of people.

“The government is eagerly pursuing irrigation projects in Kali, Gangavali, Aghanashini and Sharavathi rivers, which will benefit the farmers. Farmers can now assess their crop losses and submit their assessment on an application. The government has acknowledged the need for an airport to give a fillip to tourism, and Rs 200 crore has been earmarked for a new civilian terminal at the Naval Airbase in Karwar,” said Hebbar.

Asking environmentalists not to oppose all developmental projects, Hebbar said that the government would try to reach an agreement with fishermen protesting against the Sagaramaala project in Karwar. He also asked activists not to take up protest against the Hubballi-Yellapur project, which he said would hamper development of Uttara Kannada district.

Hebbar also expressed regret over the violent clashes in Bengaluru, and urged people against taking law into their hands. “The government will take stringent action against anti-social elements indulging in violence,” said the minister.

Karwar MLA Roopali Naik, Uttara Kannada deputy commissioner Harish Kumar, superintendent of police Shiva Prasad were among those who attended the ceremony.

“We had created the nine checkposts based on people movement and keeping in mind the inter-state borders. But now with e-pass issuance being relaxed and test positivity rate below 10%, this posting becomes invalid. The officials will be used for other Covid duty,” said T Jeya Sheela, assistant commissioner, general department.

Police will continue to monitor the checkposts, a civic official said.

“We will continue to monitor people entering the city using details in e-pass applications. Every day, the data is shared at the zonal level and then to the ward level workers. Through the home quarantine and isolation monitoring system, we will track all travellers,” Jeya Sheela added.

CHENNAI: Covid-19 has taken education further away from children of economically backward families living in resettlement colonies in the city. Most children living in the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board tenements in Perumbakkam are struggling to get access to the internet.

“We are unable to afford it, especially now that both my husband and I have no job,” said T Kayalvizhi, a domestic worker and resident of the tenements. She said since the school year began earlier this month, her son has not been able to attend a single online class. “The classes go on for six hours a day and all learning material is online. We do not have the means to access it,” she said.

A few parents have also removed their children from private schools they were attending due to a sudden hike in fees. “I tried requesting them for concessions or at least to give my daughter a scholarship since she’s a top student. But they denied it saying they themselves are struggling to pay teachers. I am looking for other schools that charge nominal fees,” said T Raghavendran, another resident. He said the decision to pull his daughter out of school has affected her deeply. “She is very upset, cries a lot and is worried that she will not be able to study further. While I won’t let that happen, we are also worried about her future, given the current scenario,” he said. Raghavendran said many children, who are going through similar situations, are affected more.

“My daughter has stopped eating properly and is constantly worried. She feels that she will not be able to study further or achieve her dreams,” said P Rukmini, whose daughter studies at the government high school at Perumbakkam. Here, even the teachers have been having a hard time taking online classes.

“A majority of the students have no means to get online. So we are calling them over the phone, sending study material on WhatsApp. We can’t even visit the tenements as it’s a containment zone,” said a teacher from the school.

The tenements have more than 25,000 children and only two government schools — one for primary and one high school. The others have enrolled their wards in private schools and many parents are struggling to afford it since the pandemic left them unemployed. They urged that more government schools be set up in the locality.

121,['16/08/2020'],Eyebrows raised as PCCF revokes RFO’s suspension,"NAGPUR: In an unusual case, the principal chief conservator of forests (HoFF) has revoked the suspension of a range forest officer (RFO) Sachin Shinde from Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR).

Shinde was suspended in the Rs29 lakh scam. PCCF N Rambabu’s decision has perplexed many senior forest officials who asked whether such a suspension issued by an IFS officer, who heads the administration, can be revoked?

Shinde was suspended on July 16, 2020 by Poonam Pate , deputy director (core) of NNTR, after an inquiry committee report indicted Shinde for various irregularities like non-payment of wages.

However, Shinde lodged a complaint with the PCCF office on July 23, and also sought the help of the Forest Rangers’ Association countering his suspension as illegal and demanded revocation. He also condemned a press note issued by Pate highlighting his suspension in the media.

As an administrative head, Pate had suspended Shinde RFO under Section 4 of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Discipline & Appeal) Rules, 1979. Senior officials feared revoking such suspensions will set a wrong precedent.

Justifying his decision, PCCF Rambabu said, “As the post of deputy director (core) is not notified in the Maharashtra Civil Services Rules, Pate is not competent to suspend the RFO. Under these rules, a conservator of forest (CF), deputy conservator (DyCF) or a deputy director of social forestry has been granted suspension powers.”

However, a section of forest officials said that Pate is using powers under the Maharashtra Civil Services Rules as head of the office and is taking administrative and financial decisions related to the establishment and accounts matters by passing bills, sanctioning tenders, leave of staff, including RFO cadre. “Therefore, she is competent to suspend the RFO. Otherwise, all the administrative and financial decisions taken by her as deputy director are illegal and need to be cancelled,” they said.

“Even if the suspension order of Shinde is technically wrong, either the suspension order should have been ratified or the field director should have been asked to ratify it. On the contrary, it has not been done. It has been revoked without taking the opinion of Pate’s immediate superior, field director or APCCF (wildlife), Nagpur East,” they said.

Officials said the proposal of revocation of suspension of RFO cadre goes to the state government for approval even if it is technically wrong. But in this case, it has not been done.

On the contrary, Rambabu says, “The department head of Shinde is conservator of forests & field director. Had the decision been taken by him then I would have had no problem. The suspension order has been revoked and the field director has been asked to take a call,” Rambabu said.

Rambabu also said that after the suspension, the RFO’s headquarters have been kept at Sakoli only where Pate herself is based. Besides, she should have not made Shinde’s suspension public.

The plan is to have these two lines up to CSMT, but in phase I it will be built till Parel. These two lines will help segregate mail/express and suburban traffic, so more suburban services can operate on the fast corridor.CR’s chief public relations officer Shivaji Sutar said, “The 5th and 6th lines will be laid on the west side of the existing tracks. Now, the space where the tracks are proposed is infringed by the bridge’s pillars. The pillars will have to be shifted so that space can be made available for laying of tracks.”CR will float tenders for the bridge work above the tracks. A senior CR official said, “The tenders will be finalized in three months, after which work will take at least 30 months to complete. The cost of work above the tracks is estimated to be Rs 25 crore.”BMC will undertake work on the approach roads outside railway area, which will cost Rs 25 crore too.The bridge width of 15m will stay the same. The official said, “Right now, the span of the bridge is 27m with one pillar at 13m and another at 14m. The new bridge will have a single span of 52m, opening up enough space for tracks.”CR will also demolish another bridge between Sion-Matunga which has direct access to Dharavi, but that will be done only after the Sion bridge work is over.The official said, “As part of the 5th and 6th lines we have begun work on building a platform on the west. At Kurla, an elevated track is being built for Harbour line. The harbour line tracks at the ground level will be used as 5th and 6th lines after the elevated work is completed.”",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77568909,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1424470,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sion-bridge-to-be-rebuilt-cr-will-add-5th-6th-lines/articleshow/77567386.cms
123,['16/08/2020'],Tamil Nadu: Deserted Wellington railway station turns training ground for athletes,"Athletes maintain social distance while training

CHENNAI: Till March this year, the scenic Wellington station — part of the Nilgiri Mountain Railway — was a popular tourist attraction. It has, over the years, played host to numerous film shoots but with the Covid-19 pandemic bringing train services to a halt, the railway station soon became a pale shadow of itself. A group of 10 state and national level athletes have made the station premises their training floor for the past four months.

For six hours every day — three each in the morning and evening — they use the station’s length, about 120m, for speed and strength training. The platform comes into play during endurance training sessions and the road leading to the station is used for long-distance runs. A small patch of ground near the station is utilized by these athletes to train with spikes.

In order to follow social distancing norms, they have split into two groups. Tamil Nadu ’s Sreekiran Nandakumar, who won 800m gold at the U-20 Eurasian athletics meet in Kazakhstan last year, feels the station provides a peaceful atmosphere to train. “We do have other roads where one can run, but there will be vehicles and we have to make way for them. Thankfully, we don’t encounter such issues here,” the 18-year-old told TOI. Sreekiran is gearing up for the Indian Grand Prix scheduled to be held on September 12. Apart from Sreekiran, the other prominent athlete in the group is Mujamil Ameer, who won 800m bronze at the senior Nationals last year.

Mohamed Azarudeen, who has been the coach and mentor to these athletes, made sure the necessary clearances were in place before the sessions commenced. “We have a few athletes who are employed with the Railways and they ensured all permissions were taken ahead of training at the station,” said Azarudeen, a level-2 coach.

Interestingly, a 400m synthetic athletic track was opened at Ooty’s HADP (Hill Area Development Program) Stadium in June. However, with the stadium about 18km from Wellington, the athletes are happy training where they are currently. “The Wellington station is close by for all the athletes. While the facilities at the HADP Stadium are top-notch, commuting becomes an issue,” said Azarudeen.

127,['16/08/2020'],Maharashtra: Nine minors get bail in Palghar lynching case,"Representative Image

MUMBAI: Nine of 11 juveniles , all tribals, accused in the lynching of two seers and their driver in Kasa taluka of Palghar district on April 16, were granted bail by the juvenile justice board (JJB), Bhiwandi, on Friday, after police failed to file the final report.

This came over a week after 10 accused, against whom a charge-sheet was not filed within the stipulated 90 days, were granted default bail by Dahanu sessions court. The accused, released on personal surety of Rs30,000 each, are likely to walk out of prison next week.

State crime investigation department (CID), which took over investigations from Kasa police, had arrested 11 persons aged 12-17. Nine of them were arrested two days after the crime, while two were nabbed few weeks later. They were sent to Bhiwandi children’s remand home.

CID, which had strong evidence against two minors , filed a final report against them with JJB on August 7. They were held guilty of murder, attempt to murder, rioting, public mischief (for circulating rumours) and other charges.

Guardians of the nine, through their lawyer, sought bail as police had not found evidence against them. JJB presiding officer on Friday granted them bail as CID did not file the final report against the nine within the stipulated 90 days. Police were unable to gather evidence against the minors in the lynching and subsequent mob violence.

Seers Chikne Maharaj Kalpvirkshagiri (70), Sushilgiri Maharaj (35) and their driver Nilesh Telgade (30), heading to Surat for a funeral, were lynched by a mob in Gadchinchale village on April 16.

Police had arrested 154 adults, 226 witnesses were examined and 808 suspects were detained.

Three charge-sheets in three FIRs registered with Kasa police were filed in Dahanu court on July 15 and August 6. Twenty-eight accused had applied for default bail on as the charge-sheet was not filed in time. The court granted them default bail but for 18 a charge-sheet was filed later.

CALANGUTE: The Covid-19 induced lockdown that began in March and the continued near-total shutdown of tourism businesses in the months that followed had an unexpected side effect in the Calangute-Candolim tourism belt fear of a dengue outbreak due to stagnant water in swimming pools, water tanks and low-lying areas in shuttered properties, especially when the monsoon arrived in June.

That fear led to timely preventive measures being taken by the Candolim primary health centre (PHC) along with the Calangute panchayat.

“There have been no dengue cases. While there were a few malaria cases, none has been reported over the past few weeks,” Dr Roshan Nazareth, medical officer of Candolim PHC, said.

The PHC decided to act on the situation in May itself. “Hotels were shut, so we knew that water would stagnate in swimming pools and tanks. With the help of the local panchayat, we introduced fish in the pools that feed on mosquito larvae,” Nazareth said.

Some swimming pool and tanks were emptied. “At other places, we sprayed larvicide, which prevents mosquitoes from breeding, but that was mostly at construction sites. We even instructed hotel owners to put more chlorine in their pools , which is also effective against mosquito breeding,” Nazareth said.

There are around 200 swimming pools in Calangute and around half of that in Candolim.

131,['16/08/2020'],No preliminary investigation report yet for Calicut AI Express crash,"Mumbai: A week has passed following the Air India Express Calicut crash that killed 18 people. Since then, over a dozen flights have been landing daily in Calicut, flying in about 2,000 passengers. There has been no official word yet on initial findings, at least for the benefit of the pilots operating into these table top runways or for the sake of families of the deceased. Going by a statement issued by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) on Thursday, the stakeholders will have to wait till January to learn the lessons from the crash.

“Let’s wait for the accident report the much heard refrain is a bureaucratic approach to accident prevention,” said wing commander (Wg Cdr), K Dinesh, a former Indian Air Force (IAF) officer. Wg Cdr Dinesh, an aviation safety consultant, has been part of IAF “Go Team” , that rushes to the site to make a first assessment of what went wrong. “Unlike accidents that occur in remote areas or over the sea, those that take place at airports leave several clues. The Go Team can make an assessment, within a day or two, of what most likely went wrong based on evidence collected from the scene, wreckage, speaking to air traffic control, first responders etc. The assessment is usually 99% correct,” he said. “The team submits the assessment to the chief of air staff and immediate advisories are issued to avert any further accident. The findings are also made public, to assuage fears. Subsequently, a detailed Court of Inquiry looks into the matter and submits a final report within two months,” he added. “Waiting longer than required to learn lessons from a crash is akin to pushing aviation safety out of the window. It’s important to identify, without much delay, what happened and convey it to the relevant stakeholders. It is the most important aspect in the chain of accident prevention,” he said.

Keeping the public informed in the initial days following the crash is also an aspect followed in civil aviation accidents. US National Transportation Safety Board’s (NTSB) note about its investigation process says: “At least once daily during the on-scene phase of an investigation, one of the five members of the safety board itself, who accompanies the Go-Team, briefs the media on the latest factual information developed by the team…There is no speculation over cause.”

Another important step is releasing a preliminary report to learn the initial lessons following a crash. Under International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Annex 13 norms, a preliminary report should preferably be released in a month’s time, it may or may not be made public. Pakistan made public its preliminary investigation report about four weeks after the May 22 PIA crash. But the AAIB order issued on August 13 says nothing about submission of a preliminary investigation report for Calicut crash.

Capt Amit Singh, an air safety expert, said that the Indian Procedure Manual of Accident investigation, 2012 (6.1.1) says that a preliminary investigation report should be submitted preferably within ten days of the accident. “It shall contain the requisite information including safety hazard, either in human factor, aircraft factor or other relevant factor that is prima facie evident during the early stage of investigation such as lack of piloting proficiency, if any… to enable framing and implementation of immediate corrective safety measures,” he quoted.

Wg Cdr Dinesh says: “The fact that Indian authorities want us to wait until the final report publication indicates that we do not have the practice of initial assessment by a Go Team. Safety is yet to be understood by us in its full form yet,” he said. Under ICAO norms, an accident investigation should not be carried out to apportion blame. It should be carried out only to know the causes of the accident so as to prevent future occurrences. “Not releasing a preliminary report. Waiting for months together for the final report to learn the lessons goes against the very purpose of carrying out an investigation,” says Wg Cdr Dinesh.

135,['16/08/2020'],Karnataka: Village-level screening centres enrol community in Covid fight,"HOW THEY WORK

Lack of funds a hurdle

BENGALURU: In an effort to involve the village community in the pandemic battle, the government launched Gram Arogya Seva Kendras (GASK) to screen people for Covid-19. The initiative, which began from a hamlet in Chikkaballapura’s Gauribidanur taluk, has now grown in size, covering districts like Hassan and Belagavi among others.The screening centres, simply put, are for the people and by the people. Anganwadis or other government structures have been turned into GASKs, which are run by local ASHA and anganwadi workers with the assistance of villagers , who have contributed towards the purchase of basic health equipment like the infrared thermometer, pulse oximeter, digital blood pressure meter and a glucometer. Each of these kits is valued at Rs 6,500 to Rs 10,000.The concept was introduced in Gauribidanur’s Vidurashwatha village, popularly known as the Jallianwala Bagh of the south as 32 people were massacred by British forces in 1938, in early April. The number of GASKs has grown to 120 in the past few months.As the fear of Covid-19 gripped the entire region, a few officials conceptualised involvement of the community in tackling the health hazard effectively. Special officer deputed to the taluk, Varaprasad Reddy, and Chikkaballapura ZP CEO Fauzia Tarannum decided to experiment with the concept by setting up sub-centres or health screening centres at the village level.“We decided to create these sub-centres, which helped us in pandemic management. The screening was effective and tracking of people was easy. We could also shift the infected to the designated centres quickly with a better turnaround time,” explained Tarannum.The district administration used the initiative to reach out to residents in villages with no access to primary healthcare centres (PHCs). Chikkaballapura has 16 PHCs in its jurisdiction.After door-to-door surveys are conducted, GASK staff screen the vulnerable section of society —those aged above 60 and below 10 years and people with co-morbidities — on a daily basis.“The staff check their saturation levels, BP and sugar levels. If the parameters are above or below the normal range, the GASK refers the person to the nearest PHC for further course of action,” said Tarannum, adding that all staff at the centres have been equipped with PPE kits and trained in screening by the district health officer.All gram panchayats in the state have been asked to replicate the concept, which is proven an effective tool in containing virus spread in the hinterlands. However, officials say there’s a lack of funding from the state to sustain the initiative during and after Covid-19.“For the current fiscal, we don’t have a separate allocation for GASKs to help the 6,021 GPs. As a result, we have written to all district CEOs to generate internal revenue and look for donors to procure health equipment kits for GASKs,” said RDPR principal secretary LK Atheeq.Also, With normalcy likely to be restored in the coming months, the government may not be able to divert ASHA and anganwadi workers for GASK duty.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77569070,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1059320,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/village-level-screening-centres-enrol-community-in-covid-fight/articleshow/77566965.cms

The CM spoke to the chief secretary, director general of police and ministers and asked them to monitor the situation round-the-clock.

With some districts receiving heavy rains and facing floods, he instructed the officials to set up two control rooms in Hyderabad. Following CM’s instructions, two helicopters have been kept ready. They will be utilised to rescue those stranded in floods. Along with the helicopter owned by the state, one chopper from the military is also kept for use.

According to the CMO, ministers have been told to camp in their respective districts and coordinate with district collectors and superintendents of police on the flood situation.Following the instructions of CM, chief secretary Somesh Kumar held a teleconference with the district collectors and took stock of the arrangements put in place for handling the situation arising out of incessant rains.

The municipal administration department asked all municipal commissioners to be at their headquarters and set up 24x7 control rooms.

138,['16/08/2020'],"Now, HAM operators assist teams on ground with contact tracing","Picture for representational purpose only.

BENGALURU: Amateur radio operators or HAMs have once again been roped in to fight Covid-19. While previously they helped monitor home-quarantine violations, this time they’ve been tasked with assisting the government in facilitating contact tracing via real-time radio communication .

With the government dividing Bengaluru into 8 zones to handle cases, Bommanahalli appears to have become the focal point for the HAM operators , who have set up ward-level control rooms in their homes to coordinate with the zonal team.

Eighty to 100 HAM operators are presently helping booth-level volunteers and ward committees carry out door-to-door surveys, assist patients and trace contacts of those testing positive for the virus.

“The service of HAM operators is crucial as they are keeping the volunteer force and ground staff informed through real-time radio messaging. It has drastically cut down the turnaround time for contact tracing and patient assistance as none of the smaller booth-level teams have to reach the zonal control room to receive their next assignment,” explained IAS officer P Manivannan , who’s the zonal in-charge.

As per the duty roster of HAM operators, each ward-level control room has to conduct roll calls at 8am, 2pm and 8pm to assess people on ground. “We have installed our wireless systems in bureaucrats’ cars to get real-time feed of Covid operations,” said S Satyapal, director, Indian Institute of HAMs.

The main reason why the government has roped in HAM operators is that it doesn’t have a licence for the specific purpose. The licensing system for radio frequencies is rigid — it may take three to four months, involves expenditure worth lakhs and has to be authorised by the Union ministry of telecommunication — and Karnataka can’t afford to wait for so long. “As a result, we have decided to rent out equipment from HAM operators and utilise their services,” said Manivannan.

While HAM operators and Manivannan believe radio communication is helpful in real-time messaging, the government appears to be reluctant to use the same across the city. “With over 300 to 400 active HAM operators across the city, we are ready to pitch in. However, there has been no request from the government for our services in other zones,” said Satyapal.

Other zonal heads and IAS officers are contemplating whether there is a need for HAM operators’ services or not. “With mobile services quite efficient in the city, there is no lag in our daily operations. It is to be seen whether the service will prove effective if introduced in our zone as well,” said IAS officer Manoj Kumar Meena, who is in-charge of east zone.

139,['16/08/2020'],IAF Leads 4-hr Op To Rescue Stranded Farmers,"Hyderabad: A massive rescue operation was launched by the Indian Air Force at Kundanpally village in Telangana’s Jayashankar Bhupalpally district, on Saturday, after 10 farmers were left stranded in the floodwaters. It took two IAF helicopters, pressed into action on orders from minister K T Rama Rao, close to four hours to bring the farmers to safety.

The incident took place when the farmers went to retrieve the motors from their agricultural wells around 10am. Before they realised, the stream connecting their farmland started overflowing due to heavy rains forcing them to climb onto a tree to take shelter. From there, the farmers made multiple calls to the police and relatives. Pushed into action, villagers alerted the local MLA Gandra Venkata Ramana Reddy and panchayat raj minister, Errabelli Dayakar Rao, who in turn got in touch with KT Rama Rao.

On KTR’s orders, chief secretary Somesh Kumar coordinated the rescue. Two IAF helicopters arrived around 2pm and later dropped them at an agriculture field nearby.

In another incident near Baswapur bridge in Siddipet’s Koheda mandal, a lorry driver, M Shankar, went missing after his vehicle was washed away by the flood water early on Saturday morning. While the IAF was called in here too, the chopper could not take off from Hakimpet on time owing to bad weather. When the team finally arrived at the site 11.45am, the driver was ‘missing’, said local authorities. The mishap occured when Shanker (45) and a cleaner were heading from Siddipet to Husnabad. S Mahender, ACP Husnabad, said, “The driver was travelling in a sand lorry when a stream nearby was in spate at 5.30am. Caught in it, he held onto a tree waving to villagers to rescue him.” As news reached finance minister Harish Rao, he ordered the police commissioner and NDRF to launch a rescue operation to save the man. “But in the meantime, the man tried to crossover the floodwaters and villagers lost sight of him,” the ACP added.

In a third incident in Karimnagar, a woman police officer led a team to rescue a biker stranded on a flyover in Huzurabad police stations limits, late on Friday. Mahender, who works in a wine shop, was stuck on a causeway while returning home after his stock arrived late. Stranded with water from a stream gushing, Mahender was holding on to his bike and a pillar for support for nearly an hour. Alerted about the incident, inspector Madhavi led a six-member team that reached the spot around an hour later. “The team members used a stick to check the depth of the floodwaters. Each member using a rope to lead one another on. When we reached near Mahender, we threw the rope at him and he was rescued,” confirmed one police official involved in the operation.

Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education ( TSBIE ) on Friday issued proceedings to commence classes from August 17 and withdrew the order within a few hours.

In fact, BIE commissioner Syed Omer Jaleel, who had issued proceedings with regards to online classes on Friday, was forced to withdraw them as per instructions of higher officials as educational institutions cannot resume academic year till August 31 as per the central government instructions issued in Unlock 3.0 guidelines.

“The orders issued in the commissioner’s proceedings in the context with attendance of all staff to their respective institutions with effect from August 17 onwards is hereby withdrawn,” another proceeding from the commissioner’s office said, adding that instructions on the functioning of government and private aided junior colleges and monitoring of online classes would be issued at a later stage.

In the proceedings issued on Friday, which was later withdrawn, the commissioner had asked all junior lecturers to make efforts for admissions of students into their colleges. They were also asked to create WhatsApp groups of students for hand-holding and reach out to students who were not having television or smartphone connectivity.

Principals and junior lecturers were further instructed to monitor online classes to be telecast on Doordarshan (DD) Yadagiri, T-SAT, and YouTube and ensure all students of second year attend online classes. A BIE official said they were ready with the required material to start digital classes and were waiting for government’s nod to begin classes. Principals working in government junior colleges, meanwhile, said that instead of issuing proceedings a day or two before classes were scheduled to begin, time should be given to sanitise colleges and for staff to make arrangements to reach their workplaces.

Students and parents said the board should give clarity as they were expecting classes to start from Monday. “ If classes are not going to start any time soon, the board should inform parents and students,” M Srinivas, a parent, said.

HYDERABAD: In view of the incessant showers, which are likely to continue over the next few days, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has now pressed into action services of town planning department officials.

The officials have been instructed to check dilapidated buildings across the city and inspect sloping terrains, especially in Jubilee Hills and Banjara Hills. Those residing in dilapidated structures or in huts near sloping terrains were cautioned to either repair the premises or vacate. The instructions were given following a wall collapse in Malakpet circle. No casualties were reported.

“Instructions to identify dilapidated buildings were given ahead of monsoon. On Saturday, after the minor incident occurred wherein a chunk of an old wall collapsed, the circular with additional guidelines was issued,” a GHMC official said. As per the civic body’s records, 668 buildings are structurally unfit of whom 453 were identified in the previous year. The remaining buildings were identified as part of this year’s monsoon action plan. “All buildings need not be demolished, some of them can be renovated. We have already demolished 71 buildings in parts of city,” said a GHMC official.

Meanwhile, GHMC commissioner DS Lokesh Kumar instructed officials to inspect cellars of buildings. Officials were instructed to inspect safety measures taken up around cellars such as soil strengthening and construction of retaining walls. “Officials have bben instructed to act immediately on complaints or messages received from India Meteorological Department (IMD) and GHMC control room, and be ready in case of emergency,” the commissioner said.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Saturday hoped for an early end to the delimitation exercise in J&K so that it could pave the way for elections that will result in the participation of elected MLAs and a chief minister in the UTs’ development.

Modi described the year following the nullification of Article 370 as regards J&K as a “major milestone in the new development journey”. He said, “The delimitation exercise is going on in J&K under the leadership of a retired chief justice of Supreme Court. We want early completion of the delimitation exercise so that there are polls... there should be J&K MLAs, its own cabinet, its CM so that it can march towards development with a new vigour.”

The PM said basic rights were provided to women and Dalits in J&K over the past one year and a life of dignity ensured for refugees. He added that it was a matter of pride that the grassroot representatives — panch and sarpanch — were actively pursuing development in the UT with sensitivity.

On Ladakh, Modi said a central university, research centres as well as hotel and management courses were coming up. He said Ladakh, like Sikkim that has emerged as an ‘organic’ state in the northeast, could create its own niche as a carbon-neutral unit.

Meanwhile, TOI has learnt that the delimitation panel with former SC judge Ranjana Prakash Desai as chairperson and election commissioner Sushil Chandra and state election commissioner of the state concerned as ex-officio members, has held several meetings since April 29. Besides J&K, the panel has been set up to carry out delimitation exercise in four northeastern states — Asaam, Nagaland, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh. The assemblies of the states have already nominated the associate members who will aid the delimitation commission.

The panel, a source told TOI, is studying the census data submitted by the Registrar General of India to work out a broad map of the new constituencies, keeping in mind not only the Delimitation Act but also the J&K Reorganisation Act.

148,['16/08/2020'],Jaganmohan Reddy vows to continue fight for special category status,"VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy on Saturday reiterated the demand for special category status for Andhra Pradesh. Incidentally, this is the first time in many months that the chief minister has spoken about the SCS, one of the main poll planks of all political parties in the 2019 state assembly and Lok Sabha elections.

Jagan, who hoisted the national flag and took guard of honour at India’s 74th Independence Day celebrations in the city, reiterated the SCS demand after a year-long silence in his address, stating that the state government would continue to fight for its constitutional right of SCS till it is granted.

The last time he made a reference to SCS was in his speech at the Niti Aayog conference in 2019 in Delhi, where he emphasised the need to roll out the promise made during the state’s bifurcation.

It was only the other day that the government, in its affidavit to the high court, mentioned that the implementation of the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014 is not over as several provisions of the Act and some promises made on the floor of the Parliament have not been rolled out yet. In continuation to this, the chief minister said his government will continue to raise the demand even though the central government has been indifferent to it.

He said the wounds of bifurcation are still afresh and not healed yet. “We are initiating measures to heal those wounds and address the aspirations of the people of all regions,” he said.

He further said that untouchability still prevails in the society much against the constitutional spirit, and his government has been trying to give social justice through different forms.

“Decentralisation of governance through three capitals, introduction of English medium in government schools, implementation of economic and political reservations for the neglected sections are some of the measures this government has initiated in the last 14 months. These initiatives would establish social justice and create equal opportunities to people and places,” he asserted.

Jagan termed the opposition to English medium as a “different form of untouchability” prevailing in the society. He also termed the opposition to decentralisation of power as “denial of equal justice and equal opportunities to the people of three regions” in the state. He expressed concern over the high levels of illiteracy rate in the state among the neglected sections and asserted that his government is working to correct this injustice.

He recalled how his government has been working to give life to health and education sectors in the state through Nadu-Nedu. “The schools, colleges and hostels in the education sector and hospitals in the health sector are being given a facelift with better infrastructure,” the chief minister said.

NEW DELHI: Indira Gandhi International Airport saw a unique set of travellers from the Philippines on Saturday morning. Six children , all requiring liver transplant and one who needed post-transplant assessment, had arrived from Manila in a special flight with their parents, six of whom are also the liver donors.

According to Dr Anupam Sibal, group medical director and paediatric gastroenterologist at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, where the transplant will be carried out, the children suffer from a rare birth defect known as biliary atresia in which the duct connecting the liver and the intestines is either absent or malformed at birth. “Without a transplant, these children can’t survive for long,” said Dr Sibal.

Because the Philippines doesn’t have advanced medical facilities and many Filipinos requiring life-saving surgeries travel to India, several children were scheduled to fly to Delhi for liver transplants around the end of March. However, the Covid-19 restrictions on international flights scuppered their plans. At least four children died awaiting a flight to India, while two others became too sick to travel.

“We managed to bring these seven children, aged between one and three-and-half years, with the help of the embassies of the two countries and charitable organisations that offered to pay for their treatment. Actor Sonu Sood helped arrange the flight,” disclosed Dr Sibal. He disclosed that if the children had been forced to wait any longer, they could also have developed fatal complications.

A problem for Apollo was in deciding who would accompany them on the flight to the hospital. “We couldn’t send our doctors because they would then be required to be in quarantine for 28 days— 14 days in the Philippines and 14 in India,” said Dr Neerav Goyal, head of Apollo’s liver transplant, hepatobiliary and pancreatic unit. But realising that some Indian students studying medicine in the Philippines were returning home on the special flight, the Apollo team trained them for any exigencies during travel. “Thankfully, no medical emergencies arose,” Dr Goyal said.

The seven youngsters are in quarantine at Apollo with their parents, also the liver donors. Once they complete their isolation and test negative for Covid-19, the transplant procedures will begin.

Bernie said he was relieved to finally have his only son, Barak, in Delhi after months of waiting. “One other child was supposed to come with us but died a day before our flight to India. I feel lucky, therefore, that my son survived two bouts of pneumonia in May and June,” the 35-year-old church minister said.

Rollam Mendoza’s daughter, Emma, underwent liver transplant at Apollo three years ago. The girl needed to visit Delhi urgently after developing some complications. “I have mixed feelings because I am happy about my daughter's treatment, but sad to see so many babies suffering,” Mendoza said.

Every year, hundreds of patients visit India for specialised medical treatment and surgeries from countries like the Philippines, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Uzbekistan, Kenya, Nigeria and Malaysia, where advanced medical facilities aren’t readily available. Such patients couldn’t fly in because of the Covid lockdown. Some were also scared to visit, given India’s high incidence of infection, said doctors.

Dr Goyal noted, “We have many patients from within the country who require urgent transplant but they are reluctant to come to the hospital for the fear of Covid infection.” He added that people shouldn’t postpone or delay life-saving surgeries because hospitals are taking the utmost precautions to prevent the spread of any infection. “We screen all in-patients and their attendants for the coronavirus. Strict zoning and segregation are done for Covid-positive patients to ensure there is no cross infection with the remaining hospital patients,” claimed Goyal.

Despite plans, testing in the state remained low with 21,239 samples being tested on Saturday even as the state government had planned to cross 40,000 samples per day.Among districts, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) recorded 394 cases, followed by 175 cases in Medchal Malkajgiri which recorded the second highest number of cases.This was followed by Rangareddy with 131 cases, Karimnagar with 104 cases, Warangal Urban with 101 cases, Rajanna Sircilla with 90 cases and Sangareddy with 81 cases.All other districts in the state recorded new cases as well.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77568999,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-714245,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-records-10-deaths-1800-covid-cases/articleshow/77567457.cms

Three vaccines are in various stages of testing. When scientists give us the green signal, there will be production on a mass scale and all preparations have been made for it,” Modi said.Modi also announced the launch of the National Digital Health Mission, which includes linking all health records of an individual with a health ID.

HYDERABAD: The state’s judiciary is making rapid strides towards turning its functioning from the physical mode to online methods. A Venkateswar Reddy, high court registrar general, said out of the 10 judicial districts in the state, half of the districts have already equipped themselves with mobile vans and video-conference facility.

Reddy said remaining districts would also be provided with the facility by this month-end. “This will enable the state’s judiciary achieve giant strides in dispute resolution,” he added. The authorities were taking the district courts in mobile vans to the doorsteps of litigants and lawyers, he said.

These mobile vans are equipped with video-conference facilities and their inner view resembles a court room. These mobile vans are being arranged with the help of district collectors to assist lawyers and parties in person who cannot afford computers and internet at their homes to argue cases through video-conference or online mode.

Warangal, Karimnagar and Nizamabad courts have already equipped themselves with vans to take district courts to the doorsteps of lawyers and litigants. On Saturday, two more districts — Adilabad and Mahabubnagar — acquired these vans. In Adilabad, the facility was inaugurated by principal district judge Indira Priyadarshini on the occasion of Independence Day celebrations.

154,['16/08/2020'],"Covid-19: Schools won’t open till govt sure about safety, says Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal","CM Arvind Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Saturday that Delhi government would not open schools unless it was convinced about the safety of students. At the Independence Day function organised at Delhi Secretariat, Kejriwal said the Covid situation was under control and thanked all, including the Centre, corona warriors and different agencies and people, for together making it possible.

From next week, the government will start sending oxygen concentrators to homes of the patients whose oxygen levels drop to lower levels even after recovery, Kejriwal announced. From next month, the AAP government will launch a two-and-a-half-month campaign against dengue.

Kejriwal devoted the large part of his 22 minutes speech to Covid fight and the ‘Delhi model’ besides revival of economy and hailed corona warriors who helped people during the pandemic by risking their lives. Seven corona warriors representing their community were present at the function, which was shifted to the Secretariat from Chhatrasal Stadium in view of the current situation. The CM also remembered soldiers who lost their lives on the borders while protecting the country.

“In June, many people were leaving Delhi because of coronavirus spread and many were afraid of coming to Delhi. But in a few weeks, two crore people of Delhi have controlled the situation with their resolve, hard work and dedication. We have a long way to go, we have not won the battle but we are in a much better position now,” Kejriwal said adding the Delhi model is now being discussed all over the country, and has become a case study across the world.

Kejriwal said the capital fought Covid-19 with a scientific approach and came up with various new initiatives.

“We have come across some recovered patients who lost their lives at home because their oxygen levels dropped even after being Covid negative. We will send oxygen concentrators to the homes of such patients,” Kejriwal said adding that the home isolation model of the government helped reserve a lot of beds for serious patients and many beds got vacant because of it. “In many states, people are not getting tested because they do not want to be sent to quarantine centres for 14 days,” Kejriwal said.

Kejriwal said Delhi government is the only government to provide an assistance of Rs 1 crore on the death of a corona warrior. “This gave the corona warriors assurance that there is a government that takes care of them,” Kejriwal added.

“Delhi was the first state where plasma trials began and a plasma bank was created. More than 750 patients have received plasma and their lives have been saved,” he said further.

The CM said the government has taken steps like opening a job portal and reducing VAT on diesel to get the economy back on track. “Despite the revenue of Delhi getting drastically reduced, we did not let our subsidy get affected during the crisis. The subsidies will continue even in the coming days,” Kejriwal added.

Over opening of schools, Kejriwal said: “I want to assure parents that we care about your children as much as you do. Unless fully convinced, we are not going to open the schools. The safety and health of your children are very important to us.”

155,['16/08/2020'],"Delhi: No freedom from Covid cloud, Red Fort wears a ‘deserted’ look","NEW DELHI: Covid-19 took away a lot of shine from the traditional Independence Day ceremony at Red Fort , though it did not deter Prime Minister Narendra Modi from delivering his customary speech of an hour and a half. The forecourt overlooking the ramparts did not have the cheering schoolchildren, the VIP seating courteously deferred to social distancing, and the guests did not mind the six feet that separated each of them, accepting the necessity smilingly, though the smiles were hidden behind face masks, some, of course, designer ones as becoming of India’s 74th anniversary of freedom from colonial rule.As resplendent as always with the saffron-white-green preponderance, the whole ceremony, however, was scaled down due to the pandemic. Around 4,000 invites had been sent out instead of four times that in a normal year. Even of that, as a security official revealed, many did not turn up on Saturday due to the risk of infection. Of course, there was special attention paid to this aspect of Independence Day 2020. At the main entrance, the invitees underwent thermal scanning by security personnel garbed in personal protective equipment gear. On each seat in the VIP enclosure were a hand sanitiser kit, a pair of gloves and a hand towel.The number of guests seated on the ramparts was reduced from 400 to 130, with the foreign dignitaries and other guests being provided a separate enclosure on the lawns, all at arm’s distance from each other. And when the PM arrived around 6.50am, it wasn’t the schoolchildren’s enthusiastic cheers that greeted him. Instead, he found NCC cadets occupying the space usually seating the white-dressed children.Modi stepped out in a cream-coloured, half-sleeve kurta, on his head a white turban streaked with saffron. He was greeted by defence minister Rajnath Singh and escorted to the guard of honour. On the red sandstone ramparts, the PM unfurled the national flag, assisted by major Shweta Pandey. As the Jana Gana Mana played, Modi solemnly saluted the flag and afterwards waved to the audience.At 7.30am, Modi began his third longest Red Fort speech ever. At 90 minutes, it was two minutes shorter than his 2019 oration. As in the past few years, Modi spoke extempore and continued with his practice of not being shielded by a bullet-proof glass panel.Conspicuous by their absence at the Red Fort function were the school children. Dressed in white and national colours, they have become as synonymous with the function as the medieval Mughal fort. But with the virus lurking everywhere, the kids were not included in this year’s ceremony. In their place were 500 youngsters from the National Cadet Corps.The Prime Minister, who has made it a habit to interact with the school kids, appeared to miss the energetic gaggle. In his address, he said, “Today, our children are not here with us. The coronavirus pandemic has halted all of us.”Security was tight at the venue and across the city. Red Fort itself was under the scrutiny of 4,000 security personnel, NSG snipers, SWAT commandos and more than 300 cameras. The 350 Delhi Police personnel who were part of the guard of honour had been in quarantine as a precautionary measure.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77568856,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-321709,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-freedom-from-covid-cloud-red-fort-wears-a-deserted-look/articleshow/77568288.cms

The market which was sanitised on Friday was back to being dirty and several buyers were seen shopping flouting safety norms.Not only did maintaining social distancing go for a toss, shoppers were seen pulling their mask down to negotiate with the fish vendors.“The CCP must keep a watch on such irresponsible people and take them to task. Despite the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Panaji, the CCP inspectors are failing to ensure social distancing among buyers and sellers,” a customer, said.Another complaint of shoppers was that the market was back to its dirty state despite being cleaned and sanitised on Friday.“The fish market is filthy. There is no cleanliness being maintained by the vendors and all the fish waste is thrown around in the open,” said Kenneth Fernandes, a resident of Old Goa.Panaji mayor Uday Madkaikar said that some CCP workers went on leave Saturday being Independence Day. “A few cleaners are deployed at the Panaji fish market to clean it on a daily basis. However, after they went on leave, the premises were left uncleaned for the day. We are, however, monitoring the workers to ensure that pending tasks are completed,” he said, adding that the premises will be cleaned on Sunday.The unsealing of the fish market building however has brought smiles to the faces of fish vendors. “People have started to slowly trickle in and are confidently purchasing fish like earlier. However, it may still take a few weeks for the crowd to regularise since many Hindus do not eat fish during Shravan,” vendor Deva Lamani said.With many trawlers anchored due to rough weather and lack of migrant labour, most of the fish in the market is from Malvan, Devgarh and Karwar, vendors said.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77569143,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-526120,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/buyers-forgo-safety-as-sanitised-panaji-market-opens-for-biz-on-sat/articleshow/77567934.cms
157,['16/08/2020'],"Despite kids living in Hyderabad, old turn to NGOs for help","HYDERABAD: The pandemic has dealt a heavy blow to Hyderabad’s elderly population. Shunned by their families living in the same city, many of them are left at the mercy of NGOs to source their basic essentials. Representatives of social groups and helplines say, they have been flooded with calls — since the lockdown was lifted — either from aging couples in dire straits or children asking them to provide help to their parents, as they are unmwilling to take on the responsibility.HelpAge India’s helpline number, for instance, has been receiving at least 40 such calls every month. “In some cases the children, staying in the same city, have thrown their elderly parents out of the house and in other cases, they have refused to take care of them during the pandemic,” said Shyam Kumar, advocacy officer, HelpAge India, sharing one such case of Jayakanth (name changed), a 70-year-old retired employee living with his 65-year-old wife in Uppal.Since the pandemic hit the city, he has been requesting his IT professional son and daughter-in-law, who live in Kondapur, to stay with them. “But the son flatly refused. He said he is willing to shell out money, but not move in with his old parents,” Kumar said adding, “The old couple can hardly manage without any domestic help. And more than that, they are lonely and scared of being confined inside the house. They fear if anything happens to them, they have no one to reach out for immediate help.”But Jayakanth's isn’t a standalone incident. Other NGOs too admit to getting multiple such calls. “We received a call from a private employee from Begumpet who asked us to send free groceries and medicines to his elderly parents staying in Secunderabad. He said that he doesn’t want to take the risk of meeting his 80-year-old parents as they are more prone to contract the coronavirus. I asked him to use an online shopping portal to help his parents but he didn’t want to spend a rupee on them. Such instances are heart-breaking,” said the founder of Youngistaan Foundation, Y Arun Daniel.After receiving multiple such calls, Arun started helping the elderly with grocery and cooked food, with the limited resources the NGO raised. “While we do get calls from NRI children — from the US, Australia and Gulf countries — requesting us to check up on their old parents to provide some help, their situation is understandable. But it is sad to see how children staying in same city as their elderly parents, in some cases in same locality, are refusing to look after them,” he added.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77569363,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-191097,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/despite-kids-living-in-city-old-turn-to-ngos-for-help/articleshow/77567496.cms

On Saturday, she was a guest of the current occupant of the iconic residence. As an invitee to the At Home reception by President Ram Nath Kovind on the occasion of Independence Day, Maan was one of the three police personnel present — for the first time in the history of Delhi Police —at the customary event at Rashtrapati Bhavan.Maan, deployed at Maidangarhi police station in south Delhi, worked with the large migrant population at Bhati Mines during the Covid-19 lockdown . “The President mentioned the corona warriors in his speech and I was overwhelmed,” Maan said. “To hear my 10-year-old daughter say, ‘I am proud of you, mum’ when she learnt I had been invited to Rashtrapati Bhavan made me realise I had done something to make a difference.”During the lockdown, Maan visited localities where a substantial number of teenagers and women resided and educated them about menstrual hygiene. Drawn by her kindness, the residents later approached her with their problems during the lockdown and she was able to manage dry rations for them.Liker her, head constable Manish Kumar, posted at the office of DCP, Dwarka, the second of the three invitees, was a messiah for the impoverished people living during the lockdown. From setting up a community kitchen — an act that was mentioned by the PM in his Mann Ki Baat talk — to providing milk to newborns, Kumar took it upon himself to ensure no one slept hungry during the difficult time. Kumar also hit upon the well-reported Covid awareness drive in Dwarka in which he modified helmets to look like the novel coronavirus to draw people’s attention.“I got tested for Covid on the insistence of my colleagues, but I proved negative both times,” smiled Kumar. “From trying to bring a smile on the faces of senior citizens by celebrating their birthdays to ensuring masks and hand sanitisers for all, my colleagues and I tried to make the lockdown an easy experience for all.” Kumar, who writes poetry, had gone to Rashtrapati Bhavan during a poetry event, but not entered the building.The third invitee, head constable Jitender, 43, felt he was triply lucky to be ushered into the President’s house on Saturday. “It’s my son’s birthday today and my daughter’s tomorrow,” he said on Saturday. “When working in traffic, I was once deployed outside Rashtrapati Bhavan. It was a remarkable experience to be sitting inside for high tea.”Jitender got infected and spent part of May in isolation.

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday urged Aam Aadmi Party workers across the country to put in personal efforts to save lives around the country during the Covid-19 pandemic. The convener for the party urged workers to set up oxygen-testing centres, especially in villages, and advocated the use of home isolation in the fight against Covid.

Kejriwal said that AAP was planning to distribute the responsibilities of providing oximeters in villages among its volunteers. “The person responsible for the oximeter in a village will send his machine to the houses of the people who need it to test their oxygen levels. Along with getting tested, this will help them to go to a nearby hospital in time. The biggest problem with Covid is the failing oxygen levels, which results in loss of lives,” he said, appealing to volunteers, supporters and donors.

The CM explained to the party workers how Delhi has managed to bring the Covid situation under control and said its experience can be used in other parts of the country. “We are not trying to find faults. All governments are doing their best in this situation. We are just trying to extend a helping hand. We will work together to ensure all lives are saved,” he said, to ensure that the efforts do not turn into a confrontation with ruling parties of different states.

Kejriwal asked the party workers to help set up oxygen testing centres in as many villages as possible, saying that they will be trained on how to use a mask, sanitisation and other steps.

The CM underlined that over 60,000 new cases and around 1,000 deaths were being reported in the country every day. He added that every government, including central government, is addressing the situation in different ways but the society cannot run away from its responsibility. Kejriwal claimed that Delhi’s home isolation formula and provision of oximeters to the patients is better way to prevent deaths in the country. “People can receive treatment at home, and panchayats can help ensure oximetres and oxygen cylinders reach patient’s homes to help save more lives,” he said.

Many people from different parts of the country have come forward to donate oximeters. AAP MLA Jarnail Singh stated on Twitter that as an advance birthday gift to the CM, the Tilak Nagar unit of the party will provide 500 oximeters to the Punjab unit and oximeters would be taken to villages of Punjab. Kejriwal’s birthday is on Sunday.

161,['16/08/2020'],"Banned, but manjha injures hundreds of birds on Independence Day in Delhi","Banned kite-flying manjha leaves hundreds of birds injured in Delhi on 15th August

NEW DELHI: With kites covering the sky across the capital on Independence Day , hundreds of bird injuries were reported on Saturday. More than 90% of the “sharp” cuts were caused by glass-coated kite string, hospitals said. The number of birds reported injured is expected to spike further in the next 48 hours.

Dr Haravtar Singh, who works at two charitable bird hospitals — at Chandni Chowk and Karol Bagh — said most of the cases he operated had suffered injuries due to the banned manjha. “Till 2 pm at Chandni Chowk, I had received around 35 cases, out of which over 30 had suffered manjha injuries. The situation at Karol Bagh was similar. The birds can suffer long-term damage and some may be unable to fly again,” said Singh, adding that a majority of the cases were of pigeons.

“There will be a sharp spike in the cases by Sunday. More people will discover injured birds and the manjha, which is stuck at places, is likely to cause injuries to more unsuspecting birds,” he added. The manjha was banned in 2017 by Delhi government, citing a large number of injuries and deaths caused to both humans and birds.

Sunil Jain, who runs the charitable bird hospital at Chandni Chowk, said despite a ban existing on paper, manjha continues to take away lives. “Last year, we recorded more cases than the year before that and it shows how the ban is not being implemented. We have already received a number of injured birds this year and by Monday, this figure will rise even further,” added Jain.

Wildlife Rescue, a bird hospital in Wazirabad , said till Thursday evening, eight injured kites had arrived at their hospital. “We expect this figure to increase by Sunday and Monday,” said Shehzad.

PETA India says people can reach out to them on their emergency and helpline numbers to report injured birds. “Last year, 700 birds were injured due to the manjha in Delhi. In the next couple of days, more birds with manjha-induced injuries are expected to be rescued and hospitalised even as trade and use of banned sharp kite threads continue in the capital,” said a PETA spokesperson.

MARGAO: They have no roof over their heads to shield from the vagaries of nature. Their thatched huts don’t have lights for their children to study. There are days they go hungry when they find no work. Nevertheless, despite abject poverty and deprivation, a sense of patriotism glows bright in their lives.

The 100-odd Makadmare tribals got together in their settlement at Nirankal, near Bethora, Ponda on Saturday and celebrated India’s 74th Independence Day.

Rustic though in form and substance, the spirit of the celebration was by no means inferior. As the kids cried “Bharat mata ki jai,” and saluted the Tricolour, a sense of pride of being an Indian resonated from the depth of their beings.

“It was a soul-searching moment,” says the person who helped the Makadmares prepare for the celebrations, insisting on anonymity.

“The state may have failed them by depriving them of the basic necessities of life even after 74 long years after independence, but here they are, celebrating their Indian-ness with more of gratitude than grudge.”

Tribe headman Gopal Pawar said they have been celebrating Independence Day for the past few years “in our own small way, ever since we came to know about its significance.” “This year, we hoisted the Tricolour, and our hearts swelled with pride and joy ,” he said.

This, when until a few years ago, the government had not even acknowledged the existence of the Makadmare tribe in Goa. It was only after a spirited movement by social activists to get them enfranchised that the tribals voted for the first time in the 2017 state assembly elections. Three years later, for the political class and the officialdom, the existence of the tribe is still confined only to the electoral rolls.

Taking suo motu cognisance of TOI’s article ‘For the Makadmare tribe, a roof and electricity remain distant dreams’ published in the edition dated June 15, the Goa Human Rights Commission had called for reports from the director of tribal welfare and the chief electrical engineer of the electricity department by July 2.

Responding to the notices, both the tribal welfare department and the electricity department expressed their inability to bring any ‘light’ into the lives of these tribes citing statutory orders and official circulars.

Director of tribal welfare Sandhya Kamat in her reply said that the Makadmare tribe didn’t figure in the list of the tribes notified in the Constitution (Goa Daman and Diu) Scheduled Tribes order, 1968, and as inserted by Act 18 of 1987, as also in the circular issued by the state director of social welfare in terms of SC and ST Order (Amendment) Act, 2002.

“…it is submitted that the Makadmare tribe does not fall under ST community and hence the said matter doesn’t pertain to director of tribal welfare. The department of tribal welfare doesn’t have any documents/information pertaining to Makadmare tribe as per office records,” Kamat said.

The chief electrical engineer, Raghuvir Keni, in his reply to the notice, said that as their dwellings are made up of inflammable materials, “it will be unsafe to release electrical connection to such structures, which may cause fire accident (and therefore) hazardous to life and property.”

The TOI article had pointed out the hardships faced by the 20-odd families of Makadmare tribals living in thatched huts with no electricity connection, which invariably leads to darkness enveloping their settlement by sunset. The TOI report had also pointed out that in the absence of toilet facilities, the tribals are compelled to answer nature’s call in the open, inviting the wrath of the locals.

165,['16/08/2020'],Three out of four naval gallantry awards for Goa-based Navy men,"(From L) Capt Mrigank Sheokand, Cdr Dhanush Menon and Haridas Kundu

PANAJI: Three of the four Indian Navy personnel who received gallantry awards on Independence Day are based in Goa at INS Hansa . The list of gallantry awardees includes commanding officer of the MiG 29K White Tigers squadron Captain Mrigank Sheokand, who manoeuvred a MiG 29KUB fighter away from populated areas in South Goa before ejecting from the stricken aircraft that was on fire.

The defence ministry said Sheokand displayed exemplary presence of mind, extreme selflessness and pointed the aircraft towards the only unpopulated barren land behind Verna industrial estate before ejecting along with the trainee pilot.

The incident occurred on November 16 last year during a routine training sortie when the aircraft suffered multiple bird hits and lost both its engines. Sheokand took over the controls of the blazing jet and directed the aircraft away from the Zuari Oil Reserve and the heavily populated region of Vasco.

Sheokand is one of the most experienced pilots of the Navy’s MiG-29K fleet. He is a qualified flying instructor with more than 2,000 hours of total flying experience. For his bravery, he has been awarded the Nao Sena Medal (gallantry).

The bravery of the other two naval personnel from INS Hansa is no less daring, with helicopter pilot Cdr Dhanush Menon and air crew diver Haridas Kundu displaying courage and exceptional skill to rescue two men during operation Varsha Rahat at Belagavi. The two have also been awarded Nao Sena Medals for gallantry.

Menon is the flight commander of INAS 322, the ALH squadron at INS Hansa.

A search and rescue mission on August 9 last year saw Menon and Kundu in an advanced light helicopter trying to rescue the men who were trapped on a tree in Haloli for three days. The situation was made worse due to low visibility, heavy rain and power transmission lines.

“The officer took the extremely dangerous decision to reduce hover height to 125ft, displaying courage and exceptional skill to maintain the aircraft at hover for 25 minutes only 15 feet clear of the hazardous obstructions and saving the lives of two souls in distress. Lowering the rescue basket at the tight spot, between the dangers of transmission tower, roof of the shed and the tree called for exemplary situation awareness and alacrity for a precise rescue,” the defence ministry said.

Kundu braved the six-feet deep water and the tumultuous current and even opted to stay behind while the men were winched up.

NEW DELHI: There will be no idol immersions in the Yamuna , public congregations, or even community celebrations in parks this Ganesh Chaturthi . Delhi Pollution Control Committee ( DPCC ) has come up with guidelines for the festival, asking people to immerse idols at homes using buckets or containers.

All upcoming idol immersion festivities may follow the same protocol. “Idol immersions shall not be allowed during the forthcoming Ganeshotsav in any public place, including the river Yamuna, any other waterbody, public place, pond, or ghat,” said the order, dated August 13.

A DPCC official said that religious functions and large congregations cannot gather under the guidelines by the District Disaster Management Authority as part of Unlock 3.0, so permission cannot be granted for celebration and immersion procession. This year, Ganesh Chaturthi will be celebrated on August 22.

“Last year, we allowed community celebration at local parks where artificial ponds were created for immersion. However, this year even that is not possible as a large number of people gathering at a place is against the rules. This will increase the risk of transmission of infection by the novel coronavirus and is against the guidelines issued dated July 31,” said the official.

The official said that for other upcoming festivals, the body may issue fresh directions based on the next set of guidelines.

Regarding the idols, DPCC directions state they should be made from natural materials, like traditional clay. Baked clay and plaster of Paris, on the hand, are a no-no. Painting of idols is also discouraged. “In case idols are painted, only water-soluble and non-toxic dyes should be used,” said the notice. The violations of any of these directions, which are issued under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, include imprisonment for up to five years, or fine up to Rs 1 lakh, or both. DPCC has directed all agencies to also submit an action-taken report each week in this regard, beginning Monday.

It is in view of these rising numbers that the state had charted plans to conduct the survey — to identify patients and begin early treatment.“The survey is conducted by field level medical personnel, Asha workers and ANMs (auxillary midwives) as they are the ones who have maximum access to villagers. Currently, certain districts are finding it difficult to carry out the surveys routinely,” said an official from the state health department.“While there is already a shortage of manpower — some PHCs have just two ANMs — the fact that many field workers are now affected by coronavirus, has made matters worse,” he added.The Centre for Covid monitoring, which is a think tank comprising experts from FICCI (Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry), ASCI (Administrative Staff College of India) and FTCCI (Federation of Telangana Chambers of Commerce and Industry), has projected that by the end of September, new cases being recorded per day will cross the 4,000 mark.

NEW DELHI: East Delhi Municipal Corporation ( EDMC ) is planning to use crop stubble (parali) in place of wood at crematoriums under its jurisdiction.

The matter was discussed at a standing committee meeting on Friday after a resolution was moved by Ajay Sharma, a councillor from Welcome Colony (ward 39) for purchasing the cakes made from stubble. He said that burning of stubble in farms has been the main source of pollution in the city every winter.

Leader of House, EDMC, Parvesh Sharma also supported the proposal and informed the committee that an NGO, which is purchasing stubble from farmers, has already agreed to supply cakes made with stubble at a reasonable price to the civic body.

“We are all aware how the national capital becomes a gas chamber after neighbouring states start burning stubble while preparing their farms for the next crop. While they are doing it to save the cost of disposing of stubble, we can contribute in reducing pollution and also helping these farmers financially,” he said after the proposal was approved in the standing committee.

Sharma further stated that the eco-friendly solution will help resolve the problem of environment pollution and also minimise the use of wood.

There are five crematoriums under EDMC’s jurisdiction and all these places use wood for cremation. The proposal will be placed in the next house meeting for final approval.

A senior official, present in the meeting, said, “The proposal has been sent to the commissioner and after understanding its aspects, viability etc. it will be presented in the House. At present, around 5,000 -6,000kg wood is required in a month. Naturally, their use will decline if we get an alternative.”

Doctors are urging the public to consult them immediately if they show any symptoms to avoid the illness turning severe and resulting in mortality.In Madurai district, the total number of cases is 12,643, of which 1,028 are active. There have been 315 deaths. However, of the active cases, more than 700 are hospitalized and require oxygen support. Infrastructure has not been an issue so far as the district has facilities for 1,200 beds with oxygen support and 357 intensive care unit (ICU) beds.“Patients should not underestimate Covid-19. Nowadays, we are finding some patients consulting a doctor only after their symptoms turn highly severe. Even Covid-19 patients, who are asymptomatic or show mild symptoms must understand that their condition may worsen any time, especially if they have comorbidities,” said a senior doctor at the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH).Doctors further warned the public not to try self-medication with paracetamol and antibiotics and try to manage symptoms without consulting them. “There is no hard and fast rule as the disease is still unpredictable. Whenever someone shows even mild symptoms of Covid-19, they must always consult a doctor,” said Dr Prem Ananth P, a consultant interventional pulmonologist.He added that there are instances of patients showing clinical symptoms even after results of swab samples tested through RT-PCR are returning negative. “In such cases, we find clear signs of viral pneumonia through the CT scan.

TRICHY: As the 74th Independence Day celebrations turned out to be a low key affair across the country on Saturday, it was no different in the state too. The Trichy district administration restricted its celebrations to flag hoisting and awarding of frontline health workers in the fight against Covid-19.

Hoisting the Tricolour at the Armed Reserve Police force ground in the city, collector S Sivarasu accepted the guard of honour accorded by the police force. As advised by the government, the march past was not performed. The collector honoured 98 frontline health workers including doctors from modern medicine, Indian medicine and homeopathy streams, nurses , sanitary workers and 108 ambulance workers in the health department and staff of local bodies for their service in the past five months.

“The role of frontline health workers must be appreciated. So, we have used this opportunity to appreciate them with certificates to encourage them,” the collector told TOI. Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH) dean Dr K Vanitha, medical superintendent of MGMGH Dr R Yeganathan, district epidemiologist Dr A Aravinthkumar and district programme manager, district AIDS prevention control unit (DAPCU) Dr S M Manivannan and staff nurse S N Jayabharathi were among the recipients of the award.

Before flag hoisting, the collector paid tributes to the martyrs of World War 1 at the memorial site in Gandhi market area. Unlike previous years, the collector visited 10 freedom fighters at their houses and honoured them. Usually, Independence Day celebrations would see the participation of about 1,000 spectators but the number was down to about 300 this year as the state government cancelled the cultural programmes of school and college students.

The wage is fixed on the basis of skill-level and the rates are revised from time-to-time.Around one-fourth of wages that convicts earn are used to pay compensation to the victims of the crimes they have committed. Jail sources said that wage hike will benefit about 4,000 convicts who are employed at the production centers at the jail or are engaged in housekeeping, gardening or at the kitchen.Tihar authorities said that apart from the wages, convicts maintaining good conduct have been granted special remission by the prison department.

NEW DELHI: Kite flying is an integral part of Independence Day celebrations, but this decades-old tradition can be hazardous, even fatal, when metal-coated manjha (kite string) is used to fly kites.

On Saturday, a total of 37 incidents of power lines tripping were reported from different parts of the capital due to the entanglement of manjha in electric installations. The number went up from 26 last year.

Metal-coated manjha is a good conductor of electricity and not only poses grave danger to the kite flyer, but also results in disruption of electricity supply in an area. Discoms had appealed to Delhiites to not fly kites near electric installations and overhead power lines on the occasion of Independence Day.

Discoms had said that people needed to be cautious due to the ongoing pandemic as entanglement of manjha may interrupt power supply to hospitals and other essential services. On Saturday, Tata Power-DDL reported 22 cases of tripping in its area in north Delhi, while 15 such incidents were reported from areas under BSES Rajdhani Power Limited and BSES Yamuna Power Limited.

“The entanglement of kites in electric installations led to a total of 22 tripping in Tata Power-DDL areas. One 33KV grid, two 66 KV circuits and one 33KV circuit were impacted. These trippings impacted power supply to approximately 56,000 consumers,” a Tata Power-DDL spokesperson said.

According to estimates, tripping of one 33/66 KV overhead line can disrupt power supply to over 10,000 residents of an area, while tripping of a single 11 KV line might cause disruption to over 2,500 residents. Discoms said disrupting power supply and causing damage to power equipment is punishable under the Electricity Act and the Delhi Police Act.

VIJAYAWADA: Rains and the Covid-19 outbreak failed to dampen the observance of Independence Day in the city as schools, colleges and offices shifted celebrations online.

Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy hoisted the national flag at state-level celebrations at the Indira Gandhi Municipal Stadium in the city. Large portions of the ground were waterlogged following continuous rainfall and a special track was laid inside the stadium to facilitate the movement of the chief minister’s vehicle and parade.

Traffic was diverted on Mahatma Gandhi Road from Benz Circle to Old Bus Stand in view of the celebrations.

Chief secretary Nilam Sawhney hoisted the flag at AP secretariat. “Freedom enjoyed by us is the result of sacrifices made by the freedom fighters. Similarly, frontline warriors are sacrificing their lives to protect us from Covid-19 and we should respect them,” Sawhney said.

MADURAI: At a time when there is talk within AIADMK on the chief ministerial candidate for the next assembly election, people of a village in Theni have put up posters expressing the desire that O Panneerselvam , a native of the district, should become the next chief minister.

Posters saying ‘OPS, #2021 CM for OPS’ have been put up throughout the district by Kenjampatti villagers. Incidentally, the village is the native place of Krishnan, personal assistant to Theni MP and OPS’ son O P Ravindranath Kumar. However, he denied he has anything to do with the posters.

AIADMK office-bearers in Theni said they were not linked to the posters and were as surprised as others who saw them on Saturday. S Murugan, 32, who works as a programmer in Bengaluru, said he was part of the team that put up the posters. “Appa (OPS) was the person selected by Amma(Jayalalithaa) to occupy the chief minister’s chair. He is the only person who deserves to occupy it by all means and hence we just came out with this poster,” he said.

Asked about AIADMK’s prospects in the next election and alliance with BJP, he said the alliance with BJP was something that Jayalalithaa herself had entered into and he did not see anything wrong with it. Palpandi, another villager, said their village has 220 votes and the posters were long due. “If you come to our village you will see that we have nothing more to desire in terms of infrastructure like roads and water supply, as we got it all from OPS. So it is natural that we would want him to be the next CM,” he said.

Selvam (name changed), another villager, said that the villagers had decided to come up with the posters after hearing that there was a proposal to make EPS the chief minister candidate again. “It is something that many ministers are against, and our village is the first to say it out loud,” he said.

While the more tech-savvy doctors have switched to telemedicine to consult patients, doctors of Shri Krishna Hospital in Kakkinje, Belthangady taluk in Dakshina Kannada have opted for a rather adventurous method to offer treatment to those in need – garbed in personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, doctors are trekking to remote villages in the far reaches of the Western Ghats Medical director of the hospital, which is located at the foot of the Western Ghats in Belthangady, Dr Murali Krishna Irwathraya pointed out that theirs was the only healthcare institution within a 40km-radius in the Charmadi area. “Our ambulances can be booked with a phone call. Since doctors are generally disinclined to work in rural areas , we are a small team of doctors working at our 30-bed facility. One of the doctors is my wife Dr Vandana M Irwathraya. Many patients visit our hospital from distances as far as 25km. We also have a dedicated ambulance to ensure that accident victims are brought to the hospital without delay,” Dr Murali Krishna told TOI.He said that, following the enforcement of the lockdown, the hospital was compelled to suspend operations under the ‘Shri Krishna Yogakshema’ initiative under which the doctors made door-to-door visits to patients in surrounding villages.. “But when we found that patients were struggling, we resumed door-to-door services a month ago. There have been instances wherein doctors have had to trek for a kilometre wearing PPE kits since the terrain is such that the ambulance cannot go all the way to the patients’ homes. We provide general body check-up, dressing, nebulisation and ECG services on such visits. All staff deployed on these visits are provided PPE kits,” Dr Murali Krishna added.The doctor said that patients and those in charge of tending to them were also imparted basic lessons on hygiene, yoga and the benefits of pranayama. “This programme was launched five years ago, and it turned out to be a blessing for the people when the pandemic struck,” he said.One of the instances that Dr Murali Krishna said they were unlikely to forget was of a fortuitous visit to the home of a patient, the family members of whom were convinced was dead, and had started preparing for her final rites. “When our team checked the patient’s vital parameters, the doctor found that she was alive, and suffering from severe hypoglycemia – a condition wherein the sugar level in your blood drops – and was given IV fluids.

187,['16/08/2020'],"No corruption, claims Delhi University, seeks funds for 12 colleges","Delhi University

NEW DELHI: Taking “strong exception” to allegations of corruption levelled against it by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia , the Delhi University administration has claimed that the charges are false and that the government should release the necessary grants for all 12 fully-funded DU colleges. In response, the government reiterated that it ordered a financial audit of seven colleges, including six of those fully funded by Delhi government, only after “many parents and students of these colleges complained about financial irregularities.”

The press release issued by DU’s dean of colleges on August 14 stated that the varsity has taken “strong exception to the sweeping statement alleging graft charges in the 12 colleges by GNCTD.”

Sisodia had recently alleged corruption and ordered audit at a few of the colleges. “The inability of Delhi government-funded DU colleges to pay staff salaries despite a 70% increase in budget allocation in the last five years indicates corruption,” the deputy CM had said.

In its response, DU stated that there are three types of audit, which are conducted on an annual basis in the university— internal audit conducted by DU-approved panel of auditors, examiner local funds account audit conducted by Delhi government and the AGCR conducted by CAG.

“The audit reports of all these colleges till date reflect that the financial affairs are managed as per norms of University of Delhi and general financial rules.”

DU explained that the increase in expenditure was due to the implementation of the 7th Central Pay Commission, which increased the salary per person by approximately 25%; the increase in wages paid to contractual staff; an increase in salary of ad hoc faculty by approximately 60%; and an annual increment of 3% over the period of five years. Increase in dearness allowance and addition of new courses also resulted in increased expenses, the varsity added.

Apart from salaries, the increase in expenditure is due to “inflation; increased number of students due to implementation of EWS reservation; and increase in electricity, water supply, sanitation and security bills on account of shifting to new campuses.” “The cumulative effect of all the above factors increased the expenditure under the head other than salary by approximately 300% - 500%,” the dean of colleges added in the statement.

DU also said that the governing bodies of all the 12 colleges have been formed as per rules and regulations. “As per DU rules, there is no linkage between formation of governing body and release of grant-in-aid. Withholding of funds has caused extreme hardship to staff and students of these colleges.”

Asking the government to release grants, DU said that the “colleges cannot be involved in graft cases at all and it is unfortunate that the statement in the media by the deputy CM has offended the sentiments of staff members and students who have worked hard to build the academic standards of their institutions.”

Delhi government officials in a statement said that “funds being given by Delhi government to the colleges are public money and it is the responsibility of the government to keep an account of public money on the complaint of the public. For this reason, the government has decided to conduct a financial audit of colleges of DU. Why is the University of Delhi scared of audits is beyond comprehension. If Delhi University feels that there is no financial mess, then there is no need to fear. The truth will come out in the audit.”

They also questioned why DU has not paid the salary of staff for the last three months despite the government releasing the funds.

Police lured the peddlers into their trap and caught them red-handed with the drugs that were packed in cake form in small bundles of brown paper.

The accused have been identified as K Senthil Kumar, 43, of Nagercoil and M Durairaj, 44, of Nanguneri. Inquiry with them revealed that two men Mani and Maheswaran had handed over the drugs and asked them to deliver it near Tiruchendur in Tuticorin district.

“They are former Goondas Act detainees. They did not have any idea about smuggling and acted only as carriers. We are on the lookout for the two main accused from Dindigul and Nagercoil, who operated the arrested men. Only after arresting them, we will know the source of the contraband item and its destination,” Jayakumar said.

In the last one month, the Tuticorin district police had registered 25 cases and arrested 32 people for peddling drugs. Probe with accused in one of the cases led to the arrest of the two on Saturday. The arrested duo had initially brought samples worth a few thousand rupees and made to bring a larger quantity, following which they came on a bike with a 25kg stock and were caught. The operation began late on Friday and continued till Saturday. Cases pending against the arrested duo include murder, theft and brewing illicit arrack.

Her husband Balamurugan, who is with the intelligence unit of Tirunelveli city police, had returned to work after recovering from Covid-19. With him under quarantine for two weeks, Maheshwari was busy with Independence Day parade rehearsal and looking after her children. Sunk in grief over her father’s demise, she wanted to leave immediately, but she did not want things to go wrong at the parade as it would be inappropriate to have a substitute at the last moment to lead it.

She did not inform her seniors and was at the VOC Stadium ground on Saturday morning. The mask helped cover her grief as she led the parade with her usual deep voice. The guard of honour was accepted by district collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish. Soon after the parade, Maheshwari and Balamurugan hurriedly left the ground, rushing to Vadamadurai.

It was only at this point that officers came to know about her loss. Praise and condolence messages started pouring in for her on social media as pictures of the officer leading the parade were widely circulated. Maheshwari was inconsolable and was not in a position to talk about her act and the grief she hid for more than 13 hours. She reached Dindigul in the afternoon and paid her last respects to her father.

HYDERABAD: A high-power committee, formed to investigate the alleged rape of a 14-year-old girl at an orphanage in Ameenpur, plans to interview children who were earlier staying at Maruthi Home, where the incident occurred.

The committee met the family of the minor at Bowenpally and some former inmates of the orphanage on Saturday. “No children, so far, have alleged similar abuse or harassment. They may open up in due course of time,” a WCWD official told TOI.

According to Rangareddy DCPO, Maruthi Home, where the 14-year-old girl was sexually assaulted, was last inspected in April. “The inspections are done once every three months. But even during the inspection, the incident did not come to light. At least four members from the inspection committee would go for inspection. They check the medical profile of the girls,” said DCPO Satish Babu.

According to a official, several girls from the Bharosa Centre and WCWD were also shifted to the home. “Elopement victims from Bharosa Centre and rescued girls by WCWD were also sent to that home. They were up-to-date with documents and would maintain the home well following Juvenile Justice Act. The incident came as a shock for many of us,” the officer added.

A fake e-pass racket at Pallapati in Karur district was busted by the district administration on Saturday, resulting in the arrest of five people.

The Aravakurichi police arrested a car driver G Venkatesh, 23, of Nanguneri in Tuticorin district, the owner of TT travels in Pallapatti, Thamimun Ansari, 25, of Pallapatti and three passengers Iqbal, 22, Shakeel , 22 and Kaja Mohideen, 22, of Pallapatti.

The racket came to light through messages circulated on WhatsApp groups in Pallapatti by Ansari. According to the message, he offered to take anyone to any part of the state using e-pass for 2,000 per head. However, it was revealed during investigation that they did not have a valid e-pass.

As the issue came to the notice of the Karur district collector, T Anbazhagam, he directed the revenue divisional officer (RDO) of Karur, N S Balasurabamanian, to plan an operation to nab Ansari and his aides.

Balasurabamanian assigned village assistant of Aravakurichi, Subramanian to go ahead with the mission. Following this, Subramanian contacted TT travel agency and asked them to take him to Chennai. After striking a deal, Subramani went to the agency on Friday evening and paid 2,000.

As planned by the agency, Subramani waited at a particular location in Pallapatti when a car driven by Venkatesh arrived there. Iqbal, Shakeel and Mohideen were already inside. Subramani boarded the car and as the car reached the Aravakurichi bypass on Saturday morning, a police team led by sub-inspector of police, Aravakurichi, R Saravanan intercepted the vehicle.

“Inquiry revealed that they had been doing this for the last few months. They took some people to Chennai and few to other parts during the period,” said Saravanan.

Police booked all of them on charges of violation of lockdown norms.

“I never expected a small help to a pregnant woman with blood donation to bring such laurels. But I feel very honoured. If such encouragement is given, it will boost the force’s morale and they would do better service ,” he told TOI on the way to Trichy from Chennai after receiving the award.

What brought Abuthahir the award was his compassion towards a pregnant woman, Sulochana, 25, who was sent back by a private hospital due to shortage of O positive blood to perform caesarean delivery in Manapparai on April 6. On seeing the woman and her husband waiting for a vehicle to return during the lockdown, Abuthahir, who was on duty on the road, approached them and volunteered to donate blood.

As he donated the blood at the right time, the caesarean was performed and a baby girl was born the same night at the hospital.

201,['16/08/2020'],Lesson on Karnataka freedom fighter included in Maharashtra varsity syllabus,"Mailar Mahadeva

HAVERI: Although he was the only Kannadiga to participate in the epochal ‘Dandi March’ led by Mahatma Gandhi, few people in Karnataka, leave alone the rest of India, have heard of Mailar Mahadeva, a freedom fighter who has also participated in the ‘Quit India’ Movement. However, a lesson on this little-known historical personality, once known as the Bhagat Singh of Karnataka, has been included in the syllabus of the Kannada optional paper at the Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University in Nanded, Maharashtra .

The lesson on Mailar Mahadeva is a drama written on the freedom fighter by Manu Baligar , president of the Kannada Sahitya Parishat (KSP).

Member of Mailar Mahadeva National Memorial Trust VN Tippanagoudar said that the organisation had managed to get lessons on the freedom fighter included in the Kannada textbooks for class VII. “We are in talks with the authorities concerned to set up study centres to encourage research on Mailar Mahadeva at the universities. But varsities have not expressed interest to undertake such an initiative,” Tippanagoudar said.

Baligar said that he had been intimated by the Maharashtra university about the inclusion of his drama on Mailar Mahadeva, which is a narrative focussing on his heroics in the freedom struggle, in its curriculum. “It will help the younger generation learn about the sacrifice of Mahadeva and his family members. It is disappointing that universities in Karnataka are disinclined to include him in their curriculum,” he added.

Aam Aadmi Party member Vikas Soppin rued the neglect that Mailar Mahadev had suffered in his home state. He urged varsities in Karnataka to establish a study centre in Mahadev’s name to educate the next generation about his legacy and contribution to the nation.

Chairman of the department of Kannada at Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University Prof Ramesh Mulage said that Mailar Mahadev was a staunch follower of the Mahatma, who had never taken up arms in his struggle against the British. “His life and the sacrifices he made need to be remembered, and will serve as an inspiration for the youngsters,” he said.

The corporation on Saturday floated a request for proposal (RFP) for collection, transportation, processing and management of construction and demolition waste under public-private partnership (PPP) model.

As per the plan, the plant will accept the construction debris for a price and recycle the same into flooring tiles and pavement blocks, and sell them. A private organisation with expertise in operating the plant will be identified. Two acres of land is okayed near Panjapur sewage treatment plant (STP).

“We have carried out a study through which we inferred a significant demand for the construction debris recycling plant. Design, build, finance, operate and transfer (DBFOT) model is considered,” a senior corporation official said.

Srirangam and K Abishekapuram zones that have a significant number of decades-old buildings were identified as potential localities to generate construction waste.

“The absence of C&D plant was a blot in Trichy’s cleanliness accolades which robbed the city’s chances of securing top 10 ranks in cleanliness surveys. The facility will safeguard water bodies from pollution,” the official added.

A suitable private player will be identified within the next two months to materialise the proposal.

According to officials of the women and child welfare department (WCWD), there are over 200 such shelters up and running in the state — most of them in Rangareddy and Medchal districts. Within Hyderabad, there are at least five. Apart from flouting norms under the Juvenile Justice Act, many of them operate out of crammed spaces — some as small as a bathroom — often discreetly, with no signboard outside the CCI.“Most of them spring up in the outskirts and not core city limits as the arrangement make its easier to escape from the officials’ watch,” said a WCWD official, raising an alarm about the safety of children living in these CCIs — a fear echoed by many activists.“The children in these places are very vulnerable to all kinds of abuse. Since these CCIs — rapidly growing in numbers — are not on the government’s radar, nobody knows what happens inside the homes. The children could be abused or forced to beg by the staff or even trafficked,” said Mamatha Raghuveer, founder of Tharuni NGO, who works with Telangana Women Safety Wing. She added, “Most of them are running a business, using those kids to attract charity funds...Maybe just 10% of these unregistered orphanages are genuine.”Given the large number of these shelters, WCWD officials say it is impossible to initiate action against all of them. “Whenever we identify an unregistered CCI, we crack the whip on them. But often, they go unnoticed. Also, while some owners, after our intervention, shut the orphanage down, they open another one within two years,” the official said. In 2019, 18 unregistered homes were shut in Rangareddy.While the District Child Protection Officer (DCPO) of Rangareddy, Satish Babu, maintained that regular inspections are conducted to weed out those lacking proper facilities “like food, hygiene, utilities and audit reports”, Dr Tripurana Venkataratnam, former chairperson of Telangana State Commission for Women raised doubts over the quality of these inspections. “Though there is an inspection committee that monitors the CCIs, it exists only on paper.

The organisation’s Sri Ramakrishna Vidyarthini Bhavan at Lalbagh , a hostel meant for students as well as working women from all communities, has started making traditional Bunt masala powders used in day-to-day cooking .

This came about since hostels are closed since the lockdown was clamped, and the authorities are finding it difficult to maintain the infrastructure as well as pay the salaries of the hostel staff.

It’s no secret that the Bunt community is well known for their hospitality, as many from the coastal district have established hotels and restaurants in other parts of the country, especially in Mumbai. Even videos of actor Shilpa Shetty cooking traditional Tulu cuisines have gone viral on several occasions.

The hostel consists of two cooks, three assistants, four house-keeping staff and two security personnel. Ajith Kumar Rai Maladi, president of Buntara Yane Nadavara Mathr Sangha, and the management committee were of the firm opinion not to fire anyone. However, they had to find a way to pay the salaries of the staff and maintain the hostel.

After discussions with members, the president and the woman members of the committee arrived at a solution—to manufacture traditional Bunt cooking masala powders. This includes the coastal districts’ favourite ‘kori aajadina masala (chicken fried masala)’, 3 in1 chicken masala, royal chicken masala, sambar powder, rasam powder and an exclusive herbal immunity booster kashaya (herbal powder).

Sarika Bhandary, secretary of the hostel committee says, “We operate on a no-profit-no-loss basis. The mess bill is calculated at the end of the month, and shared among the hostellers. In the meeting several suggestions came up, but everyone was for making masala powder. Our members Latha Shetty, Sharmila Shetty and Mamatha Marla are experts in the field of making traditional Bunt style of masala powders, and they voluntarily supported with their recipes.

The women have successfully manufactured 200 kg of masala powders in the first consignment, by maintaining hygiene and taste, and the second batch is ready for sale.

THANJAVUR: District collector M Govinda Rao has instructed Covid-19 positive patients who have opted for home quarantine to have a pulse oximeter and a thermal scanner for their own usage. He also warned medical shops of stringent action if found charging exorbitant prices for the devices.

“People in home quarantine should have one oximeter to monitor their oxygen level being supplied to their brain and a thermal scanner to check body temperature frequently. If they find anything abnormal, they should immediately approach the government hospital for further treatment,” the collector said.

“If anyone is found selling pulse oximeter and thermal scanner at rates higher than the maximum retail price, action will be taken against the concerned medical shops by the district administration,” he warned.

A pulse oximeter costs between Rs 1,800 and Rs 3,000. Few companies are offering up to Rs 2,000 discount on the device. Likewise, a thermal scanner costs between Rs 1,500 and Rs 3,000, sources said.

The district administration has taken various measures to combat the spread of coronavirus in the district. People infected by the virus are sent to isolation wards established in Government Medical College Hospital in Thanjavur for treatment. This apart, three more Covid-19 centres have also been established in Vallam, Annai Engineering College in Kumbakonam, and slum clearance board building in Pattukottai .

As of now, around 100 people are under home quarantine in the district, health officials said.

About 95% of development works that include the construction of toilets, installation of solar lamps and dustbins and greywater treatment plants have been completed. Currently, peripheral works like parking area are being undertaken by KRIDL and gardening work by the PWD is under progress. The beach is getting ready for inspection by the national and international jury.”

To plan sustainable tourism and healthy coastal management, the ministry of environment , forest and climate change has conceived an integrated coastal management scheme, Beach Management Services (BEAMS), to reduce existing pollutants on beaches and to aspire and achieve high international standards like Blue Flag in India.

There are 33 very stringent criteria to be complied to, based on which a beach is certified as Blue Flag, and permitted to hoist its flag. The moment a blue flag is hoisted on a beach, the mention is made in the global headquarters of the Foundation for Environment Education in Copenhagen , Denmark. Tourists who are familiar with Blue Flag beaches and its standards then plan their holidays in that country.

Some of the works undertaken include bio-toilet blocks, changing rooms with shower panels, jogging track, and children’s play area for recreational activities of beachgoers, provision of purified drinking water on the beach to avoid plastic bottle on beaches, CCTV cameras for 24x7 surveillance , watchtowers and safety flags.

MANGALURU: Teachers from the Government Higher Primary School , Nallur in Karkala ensured that every child enrolled in this school celebrated Independence Day at home. Nagesha, the headmaster said, “We were inspired to involve the students more systematically and purposefully following the TOI report.”

TOI recently reported how this school rings the bell every day for students to study at home.

“Since the school is located in an elevated area, we bought a new mike set, and the horn speaker is tied to a mango tree and now we not only ring the school bell every day but also conduct an assembly. At least 75-90 students can listen to the school assembly and participate in it from their homes,” he said.

On the occasion of Independence Day, we requested parents to purchase a cloth/paper flag and to distribute sweets in their homes after the celebration. Students were asked to wear their white uniform. “We were surprised that most students hoisted the national tricolour and shared pictures on the school’s Whatsapp group. I am thrilled at the response,” he said.

The school also organised a formal function at the campus attended by all the seven teachers, including the headmaster along with Dr Rajesh and Dr Prashanth, alumni of the school, businessmen Bhaskar Shetty and Sathish Shetty, SDMC president Umanath and a few localites.

It has been a week since the school started organising regular morning assembly that also allows the children to speak through their mobile phones. Every day, a child gets an opportunity to make a presentation and introduce a book that the he/she has read — lessons learnt from it, what he/she liked about it and where it is available.

Under the government’s Vidyagama programme, teachers are conducting ‘Vatara shale’ in eight places. Students in small groups are introduced to a competency bridge course held between 9.30am to 12.30pm every day. The school’s current student strength is 123 (Class 1 to 7).

218,['16/08/2020'],FB guided by ‘political considerations’ in application of hate speech rules: WSJ report,"NEW DELHI: The Rupert Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal newspaper has claimed in a detailed report that Facebook is guided by “political considerations” when the social media giant applies hate speech rules to prominent Hindu nationalists in India.

The report refers to BJP politician T. Raja Singh , who has made several controversial comments on his Facebook account, following which the moderation team had classified him as “dangerous”.

The investigation, which was conducted with the help of several current and former Facebook employees, claims that the moderation team asked for him to be banned from the platform worldwide, saying that his “rhetoric could lead to real-world violence”. But he still functions on Facebook, where he is followed by 1.23 lakh, though his page is no longer verified with a blue badge.

“The company’s top public policy executive in the country, Ankhi Das, opposed applying the hate speech rules to Singh and at least three other Hindu nationalist individuals and groups flagged internally for promoting or participating in violence,” the report states. WSJ said that it had reached out to Das, Singh and BJP for comments, but did not receive any inputs for the story. The report says “Das has provided the BJP with favourable treatment on election related issues.” According to WSJ, Das told the tech giant staff members that punishing violations by politicians from the BJP would “damage the company’s business prospects” in India, which is Facebook’s biggest market in terms of number of users.

The report also quoted Facebook’s spokesperson, Andy Stone, who acknowledged that “Das had raised concerns about the political fallouts that would result from designating Singh a dangerous individual, but said her opposition wasn't the sole factor in the company’s decision to let Singh remain on the platform.”

219,['16/08/2020'],18 of 106 waterways fit for transporting cargo: Study,"A study by the Inland Waterway Authority found 25 waterways suitable for tourism purposes. (PTI)

NEW DELHI: Only 18 national waterways are feasible for cargo movement and 25 others are feasible for ferry and cruise for tourism purpose out of the 106 national waterways notified in 2016, a study by the Inland Waterway Authority of India (IWAI) has found.

Before 2016, only five NWs were notified and cargo movement is operational to some extent on these waterways. These include Ganga-Bhagirathi and Brahmaputra rivers .

The government had enacted the Inland Waterway Act in 2016 to give national waterway (NW) status to another 106 rivers and canals in one go taking the total number to 111. Sources said this was done after the ministry was struggling for more than nine years to get a bill passed to declare Barak river in Assam as a new NW.

Earlier, the shipping ministry required a new law for declaration of any NW and no work, including feasibility study, could be carried out.

Sources said developmental activities have been initiated in the case of 13 NWs and work is yet to start in the remaining four for cargo vessel movement. A master plan is also being prepared for feasible NWs in both freight and ferry categories, they added.

Based on the feasibility studies and detailed project reports of the additional 106 NWs, the IWAI has found that rivers such as Barak and Kopli in Assam, Mandovi, Zuari and Kumerjua in Goa, Narmada and Tapi in Gujarat can be used for cargo movement.

221,['16/08/2020'],"The hypocrisies of Indian liberals are on full display with Kashmir, says author Pankaj Mishra","has long been held out as a universal ideal.

Pankaj Mishra

takes the doctrine apart in his collection of essays, ‘Bland Fanatics: Liberals, Race and Empire’. He tells

Amulya Gopalakrishnan

how liberalism has always served a small minority, and has a troubled relationship with genuine

and human rights

How did liberalism emerge and shift shape in the West, from the 19th century onwards?

What does liberalism mean in the present moment?

What is India’s history with liberal ideas? What are its evasions?

You describe the Economist as a distillation of this creed, which it preaches with utter confidence. How has it drawn in the powerful and those aspiring-to-power, around the world?

How and why does liberalism entwine with Islamophobia?

As Anglo-American power wanes and the liberal consensus looks shaky, what might take its place?

It is best to see liberalism as a theory, and like all political theories, as a rationalisation of interests. What we know as liberalism emerged as an ideology of the propertied white male - of a rising entrepreneurial class that found itself constrained by traditional authority, whether the aristocracy, monarchy or the church. The ambitious men demanding freedom in political and economic realms assumed that the pursuit of self-interest would result in a common good. The question my book raises is how the liberal vision of individual freedom and social harmony came to be ‘transmuted,’ as the American writer Reinhold Niebuhr once put it, ‘into the sorry realities of an international capitalism which recognized neither moral scruples nor political restraints in expanding its power.’British and American liberals were not always hostile to slavery and imperialism. John Locke, often described as the philosophical father of liberalism, was a stockholder in a slaveholding company. John Sturt Mill assumed that Indians were too barbarous to be trusted with self-rule. By the 20th century, however, too many political and economic disasters had resulted from liberalism. There was a broader recognition that classical liberalism had to be moderated, that ruling classes had to embrace progressive taxation and basic social welfare, to defuse rising discontent.What looks like Anglo-American liberalism today started to emerge around 1945, as fascism lay defeated and communism appeared another mortal enemy. Indeed, recent scholars have argued that liberalism acquired inner coherence and intellectual ancestry only as the default ‘other’ of the 20th century’s ‘totalitarian’ ideologies of the left and right.During the Cold War , it became synonymous with ‘democracy,’ ‘capitalism’ and the ‘West’ in general, its moral prestige underwriting such coinages as ‘liberal capitalism’ and ‘ liberal democracy .’ It seemed like the only viable ideology left when its old rival communism collapsed in the early 90s. Liberalism re-emerged as a ‘fighting faith’ after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, when in the eyes of its publicists it seemed more than ever to define the liberal West against such illiberal enemies as Islamofascism and authoritarian China.There are many well-educated, upper-caste and relatively affluent people in India today, the self-proclaimed children of Nehru, who proudly call themselves liberals. It is important to remember that the people who led India to freedom, and indeed almost all major anti-colonial thinkers and activists in Asia and Africa, did not call themselves liberals. Why? Because in their experience, liberals were mostly false friends, as eager to endorse neo-imperialist adventures in Asia, Africa and Latin America as they had been to support the imperialism that ravaged India and much of the world.But liberalism, as I said, became the default ideology of the anti-communist Western world after 1945. It seemed more seductive when communism collapsed and history suddenly seemed to end in liberal democracy; and in postcolonial Asia and Africa many Western-educated and Westernising elites that found themselves besieged by autocrats, communists and religious extremists also started to pin this glamorous label, ‘liberal,’ on themselves. This of course didn’t hide their inherited class and caste advantages, nor their support to a belligerent nationalism when it suited them. The hypocrisies and evasions of Indian liberals are most garishly on display in Kashmir. As I write in my book, it was their neo-imperialist and hyper-nationalist rhetoric about saving the supposedly barbarous Kashmiris from themselves that first provoked my interest in the construction of liberalism as a self-serving ideology of the elites.“Liberalism,” the Economist claimed last year on its 175th anniversary, “made the modern world' and “the core liberal causes of individual freedom, free trade and free markets have been the most powerful engine for creating prosperity in all history.” This is historical illiteracy, though of a supremely confident sort. The magazine carries informative articles on science and technology and has many useful reports and statistics. But its political intelligence is not to be trusted. The Economist, as I show, has been steadfast in its support for slavery and imperialist wars, not to mention anti-democratic military coups. In recent years, it has monetised best the glamour of liberalism, offering itself as a how-to guide for people who want to become, or fancy themselves as, members of a powerful and intellectually sophisticated elite.Those wedded to universalising their modern conception of a freedom-seeking, continuously expanding individual are naturally hostile to traditional worldviews that stress either the emancipation of the individual from material desires (Hinduism) or emphasize collective solidarity (Islam). But liberalism entwined with Islamophobia particularly frictionlessly after 9/11, when many liberal cold warriors came out of retirement to fight what they saw as another long battle with another ‘totalitarian’ ideology. We can see now the calamity to which this folly led: imploding societies in large parts of West Asia and North Africa.It is too early to say. The scope for change is limited by the antiquated nature of political institutions and processes. After four traumatic years of Trump, Americans are being asked to invest their hopes in Biden, who is complicit in every disaster of the last few decades. Moreover, the journalists and columnists who cheer-led American-style capitalism and the war on terror are entrenched in the media, and show no signs of renouncing their shattered delusions.

223,['16/08/2020'],NHAI live bid for collection of toll to thwart cartelisation,"NEW DELHI: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will hold live online auction of completed highways for collecting toll to eliminate any scope of cartelisation.

The auction will be held for a specific duration, say for 30 minutes or an hour, allowing people to bid live and the highest bidder will get the contract. Prior to the live auction, the NHAI will float the bid documents giving details of the project and current tollable traffic so that the bidders can make informed decisions.

Sources said the proposal will be cleared by the highways authority next week. “The proposal came up before the Executive Committee last week and it was felt that we need to provide some on-screen facilities at our regional offices or other centres where the prospective bidders can come and participate in the live auction. Now these plans are being fine tuned,”

NHAI bids out highway stretches built with 100% government funding to private toll collection agencies for a year. The successful bidder pays the quoted amount in monthly instalments. Sources said the live auction was disbanded after trial a few years back when provision of online auction was not available.

The highways authority has also identified 6,400 km of NHs, which can be tolled after completing small remaining stretches and this would generate additional revenue of around Rs 1,200 crore annually. “While private builders take provisional approval for tolling after completing 75% work, we have not been doing so even if the road is 95% complete. We have taken it as a priority to complete them and collect toll,” said an NHAI official.

In 2019-20, NHAI had earned nearly Rs 8,000 crore in the form of toll collection from public funded roads.

Meanwhile, some of the private players collecting toll on NHAI funded highways said the live online auction may not be that encouraging.

224,['16/08/2020'],"NREGS work demand slows, gives hope against blowout","How the rural jobs scheme goes further from here will depend on how the Covid-19 pandemic pans out.

NEW DELHI: Even as MGNREGS continues to turn over record performance in the pandemic year as compared to previous financials, the demand for work has actually dipped over the last two months after the initial sharp spike. The graph is being seen as a first, though uncertain, sign that the programme may not become unsustainable as it appeared in the immediate aftermath of post-lockdown opening up.

The “work demand from households” under the job scheme is a significant parameter of employment needs on the ground. The households that are provided actual employment is much less.

According to the scheme performance reviewed by TOI, 3.08 crore households sought work in July while the figure stood at 4.07 crore in June.

The dip in July was sharp which was surprising because the post-lockdown demand trend was moving upwards expectedly given that conventional avenues of employment had come to a halt over Corona restrictions.

By mid-August, 1.48 crore households have demanded work, which is in line with the July trend. This is in contrast with the graph for April and May. As many as 3.33 crore households sought work in May which was part of the rise following the opening up.

The scheme opened on April 20 and within ten-odd days in the new financial year, the number of households which registered for employment stood at 1.17 crore.

Union rural development ministry believes the work demand based on households seeking employment indicates that the programme is stabilising and will not go through the roof as it appeared.

However, officials refused to hazard a guess on whether the fall in demand July onwards can be called a definitive pattern. The onset of monsoon and agriculture season was anyway expected to dilute the demand.

How the scheme goes further from here will depend on how the pandemic pans out, with key influencing factors being economy and return of migrants to cities. “We cannot forecast the future because nobody knows how the pandemic will behave,” an official said.

As per figures, the 143.91 crore persondays have already been generated in 2020-21 as compared to 217.62 crore persondays in 2019-20 — 66% in just four months.

While the output this year is still likely to overshoot last year’s, a slowdown in demand will limit the year-on-year jump. The initial spike had raised concerns that MGNREGS may just break all records and could become financially unsustainable.

As many as 53 separate petitions including 15 PILs (Public Interest Litigations) have been filed before the Andhra Pradesh High Court contesting the government’s decision.While majority of the petitions have been filed by individual farmers, most of the PILs have been filed by Amaravati Parirakshana Samiti and other farmers’ associations in Amaravati. These associations have moved the high court with a fresh petition or through an interim application whenever the state government has taken a decision with regard to the capital.The farmers’ associations have challenged the government for not completing development work in Amaravati even before the government announced its plans for decentralisation. They have challenged the government’s call for objections to the expert committee report as well. More than five petitions have been filed for inviting objections to the expert committee report without revealing the same and not specifying the context of the notices.Further, the state government’s proposal to give house sites in Amaravati to the landless poor from Vijayawada, Guntur and other places and the decision to shift vigilance commission and commissionerate of enquiries have also been challenged by farmers. Farmers have managed to get interim relief in those matters as the high court has stayed the shifting of offices and also set aside the government orders on land allotment.The farmers have also opposed the proposed changes to the master plan to include a new zone in the Amaravati master plan to facilitate land allotment for housing. Relying on the promissory estoppel and the doctrine of legitimate expectations, the farmers have moved a number of petitions seeking completion of works as per the Amaravati master plan and have sought compensation for the delay in completion of trunk infrastructure work.While the state government is firm on the three-capital formula, farmers as well as other litigants are firm on exploring all legal options.

VISAKHAPATNAM: Authorities have begun scouting for a suitable piece of land in Visakhapatnam to shift the headquarters of Organisation for Counter Terrorist Operations ( Octopus ) headquarters from Amaravati.

According to sources, over 235 acres of land would be allotted to the anti-terrorist force on the outskirts, between Anandapuram and Padmanabham mandals.

Earlier, the state police department had decided to set up a regional centre of Octopus in the city keeping in view possible terror threat perception to the Port City.

The department planned to set up one unit of commandos. Former DGP RP Thakur had announced it during his visit to the city before the general elections in 2019.

“An Octopus wing should be here because the city is vulnerable to attacks through seaways. We have many sensitive defence establishments here. Keeping this in mind, we asked for one unit of 100 commandos. Now, we are getting an entire unit, which will strengthen the Port City,” said an IG-rank officer to TOI.

But with no major Independence Day celebrations scheduled this year and public gatherings at a minimum, the dog squads will spend a relatively stress-free August 15.

A Chandrasekhar, reserve sub-inspector of city’s security wing said, “We don’t have a specific schedule for the dog squad this year. We have asked handlers to keep them ready so that they can be deployed as and when required.”

Officials in charge of dog squads said that the deployment of dog squads usually increased four to five days before important dates such as Independence Day, Republic Day or major festivals.

While these dogs usually attend two to three calls a day, on significant dates like Independence Day, they have to attend to nearly five or even six calls in a day.

“But this year, the scenario is different. There is no programme involving VIPs in our district. Nor will public places be very crowded,” said S Chiranjeevi, reserve inspector of Vizinagaram police. Chiranjeevi added that the dog squads will be kept on standby.

The situation is the same in Guntur district. Officials have decided to deploy dog squads if and when there is a requirement. “We are gathering local inputs. We will deploy dog squads if there is a requirement,” said SVD Prasad, additional SP of armed reserve of Guntur police.

232,['16/08/2020'],PM announces a solar park to fulfil dream of green Ladakh,"NEW DELHI: The Prime Minister on Saturday set Ladakh on course to a carbon-neutral future and announced a 7,500MW solar park there, even as funding incentives are being lined up to energise the mega project at the heart of Narendra Modi’s vision for India’s youngest Union Territory .

“Ladakh has several specialties. Not only do we have to preserve them, we have to nurture them as well. As Sikkim has made its mark as an organic state in the northeast, Ladakh — Leh and Kargil — can also create their own niche as a carbon-neutral unit,” Modi said in his I-Day speech, listing the proposed solar park among the Centre’s initiatives.

Parallelly, the renewable energy ministry is moving to partly fund the linked transmission line, the cost of which was making power unaffordable. “The transmission project is being included in the Centre’s Green Energy Corridor Phase-II for viability gap funding (VGF),” renewable energy minister Raj Kumar Singh told TOI. This will make the line eligible for up to 40% VGF.

TOI was the first to report on January 13, 2019 the project being planned by state-run renewable energy agency SECI at an estimated investment of Rs 45,000 crore. The project is to be completed by 2023 and estimated to save 12,750 tonne of carbon emission annually.

The project envisages a 5,000-MW unit at Morey plains, 215km east of Leh. A 2,500-MW unit is to be built at Suru in Zanskar, 245km east of Kargil. Some 25,000 acres in Leh and 12,500 acres in Zanskar has been earmarked for the project. The Leh and Kargil hill councils will earn Rs 1,200 per hectare, with 3% annual escalation.

Until February, Thanmayee would wake up in the morning, get her cricket kit in order and march to Visakhapatnam cricket stadium for practice. But for the last four months, this budding sportswoman has been confined to her home owing to the Covid-19 outbreak and the consequent lockdown.

Speaking to TOI, Thanmayee said, “I have been practising every day for the last five years. Never did I imagine that I would have to stay off the 22 yards for such a long time.” A student of class 10, Thanmayee has spent the lockdown taking online classes as well as attending online cricket practice sessions hosted by the district and state cricket boards.

A middle-order batswoman and an off-spinner, Thanmayee is desperate to resume net practice. She was selected in the under-19 state team recently and was scheduled to play a T-20 cricket tournament in Agartala in March. “But the tournament got postponed due to the pandemic. We are hopeful that the tournament will take place in the near future and the same team will be retained,” Thanmayee said.

Budding table tennis star Manasvi Dhulipalla shares Thanmayee’s experience. A member of the state girls’ table tennis team, Manavsi has played the SGFI National School Games held in Vadodara. Manasvi’s lockdown too was spent in attending online table tennis coaching sessions organised by the district table tennis association.

“One thing I want to say is the lockdown really helped me brush up on my academics. Since there have been no practice sessions since March, I have been able to attend all my school classes online and concentrate on my studies. I have started attending practice sessions again since last month,” Manasvi said.

Jnanita Asapu, a student of class 12 and the vice-captain of AP under-19 women’s lawn tennis team, has spent the lockdown preparing for competitive examinations and attending online classes. Jnanita won a gold medal at the SGFI National School Games in December 2019 held in New Delhi.

“I used the time I had to prepare for competitive exams. I joined my training sessions again this month and am going for practice to the Andhra University campus regularly,” said Jnanita, who wishes to join the Indian Police Service.

Both will have 2 mega watt of battery storage for round-the-clock supply,” Singh told TOI.

The Siachen project will meet the lighting and heating needs at Base Camp I, II and III. The Partapur project will meet similar needs of the Army’s 102 Brigade tasked with defending the strategically vital glacier. Singh said the projects will reduce the Army’s dependence on diesel for running generators and more than halve the cost of power. “Siachen base camp will get power at Rs 9.89 per unit and Partapur at Rs 10.34 against Rs 24-25 per unit for supply from generators,” he said.

245,['16/08/2020'],Mumbai: Demand for self-storage doubles amid lockdown,"Demand doubles for home storage spaces in city

Though she works for an ecommerce startup, Catherine Rency doesn’t post reviews. However, the meticulousness of the two masked men who covered the mirror of her cupboard in bubblewrap that frantic Friday in June, got a glowing testimonial out of her. The men belonged to a ‘self-storage facility’ that would vertically cram all her worldly belongings at a sliver of the huge rent for her Andheri 3BHK. This temporary 16-sqft vault helped Rency-—whose lease was expiring in July—return home to Tuticorin a lighter person.

All the invisible baggage of Covid—WFH, layoffs, cost-cutting, midnight evictions—is translating into visible baggage at warehouses in Bhiwandi, Govandi, South Mumbai and Navi Mumbai, as the demand for self-storage facilities in the city has doubled during the lockdown.

Renters vault to large stowing units to stack sofas, clothes and toys

Once favoured chiefly by expats and commercial enterprises, this nascent industry—that was born almost seven years ago to decrease your clutter by offering storage space in the region of Rs 100 to 250 per square foot a month—has suddenly seen a boom with takers including everyone from renters boomeranging to their parents’ home after being laid off to students packing upon realising that the only classrooms they need to attend are virtual.

Unlock these measured vaults full of sofas, almirahs, clothes, prams, toys, oil paintings and office chairs and you will find the pivots forced by the pandemic in many lives, an unexpected comma between the old and the new normal. “Everyone has their own story,” says Deepali Sanghavi, pan-India coordinator of on-demand warehousing facility BoxMy-Space, whose phone has been ringing from 8.30 am to 11.15 pm from the start of lockdown with calls from strangers living in chawls and in rowhouses alike who confide about everything from the loss of job to a nightmarish landlord. ""We get almost 100 calls a day, which is double the amount before March,"" says Sanghavi, whose firm recently stowed away 100 chairs from an office. “We even get mails at midnight now,” she adds.

Space Valet, a self-storage facility which offers boxes for small items, as well as storage units for businesses and households, has now been getting as many enquiries per day as it used to get per week before Covid. As the lockdown sprawled on, so did the demand for space. “Initially, our smaller storage units and spaces were the most popular as professionals living alone or sharing flats were vacating with their items,"" says co-founder Devak Davda. “Then, we saw demand for larger spaces increase when businesses started taking drastic steps and slightly more established professionals, some with young kids, started also moving out of the city,” says Davda, adding that the lockdown has thrown up clients in the age group of 20 to 35 from neighbourhoods like Andheri, Bandra, Goregaon, Thane, Parel, and Santacruz.

Desperation has been the chief catalyst for the concept of self-storage, a billion-dollar industry in countries like Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore. Though it has been around for years in India, the industry has floundered for recognition. It took a crisis to lead people to search for keywords like “rented storage”. “Earlier, when we tried listing ourselves online, we would be clubbed with either real estate or packers and movers, both of which are very different segments from ours,” says Disha Doctor of Your Space, a self-storage firm that launched in 2017. Doctor’s firm has four warehouses in different pockets of the city and is now signing on more warehouses to cope with escalating demand.

Apart from virtual tours of the storage facilities—some embellished by what can be described as elevator music-—these portals and apps let you take an online inventory of your items stored and segregated neatly enough to please the likes of Marie Kondo. Except for gas cylinders and combustible items, most stuff is welcome in these spaces. Which is perhaps why besides householders, business, renters, pub owners, online art exhibitioners, Doctor's firm—that offers humidity controlled environment for musical instruments and artworks—also received enquiries for “food storage” during the lockdown. “We had to redirect them to cold-storage facilities as we don’t store perishables at the moment,” says Doctor Sometimes, callers themselves need to be put in a box. Sanghavi, for instance, has identified a category of renters: “They get a quote from us simply to threaten their landlord into lowering the rent.”

MUMBAI: Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday indicated he is in no hurry to completely lift the lockdown. While virtually interacting with state Covid task force members Dr Shashank Joshi and Dr Rahul Pandit, Thackeray pointed out that wherever there’s been a hurry to end the lockdown, it has had to be reimposed.He also said that there is a misunderstanding that Covid only affects senior citizens and not children.Referring to news reports about 97,000 children getting infected with Coronavirus after schools reopened in America, he said Covid affects everybody from a six-month-old child to people of any age. “It will not be proper for us to push them into this due to overconfidence,” Thackeray noted.“We are in the first wave and I don’t want the second wave in Maharashtra under any circumstances. And the second wave comes when we pat our backs on how we controlled the coronavirus and become complacent,” he said.Thackeray said he knew the poor were badly affected but expressed fear that if students in schools get infected after they open or if an office is reopened and the virus spreads among employees, ending the lockdown that will then have to be imposed “will not be in our hands.” “We will gradually keep opening up as part of Mission Begin Again,” he saidOn the measures taken by the state government , Thackeray said that in the country, the state was probably the first to form a task force in Mumbai and in the districts too. The task force of the state has not been restricted to Mumbai and has helped share knowledge about drugs and treatment guidelines to doctors even in remote areas. Referring to the health issues faced by those who have recovered, Thackeray said there is a need to look at post-Covid care.Thackeray also spoke on the need to have permanent large facilities like the Nesco grounds and said there is a need to create them across the state and also focus on research in the fields of immunology and virology.

The work is preliminary and such trials would not replace large-scale, Phase 3 trials already underway, according to a statement by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. Most vaccine trials rely on inadvertent infection. ""Should there be a need for human challenge studies... NIAID has begun investigations of the technical and ethical considerations,"" the agency said. That includes efforts to manufacture a suitable Sars-CoV-2 strain, draft a clinical protocol and identify resources that would be required to conduct such studies. Small challenge studies would be done in small isolation units to control the virus. Larger studies involving 100 people or so would have to be done at multiple spots.

248,['16/08/2020'],‘Say sorry’: 12 teens bully boy in Gurugram,"Representative image

GURUGRAM: The family of a 17-year-old boy, a British resident of Indian origin, has approached police with a complaint against 12 boys, who roughed him up on July 23 in Sushant Lok.

According to the complaint, the boy stopped attending online classes and engaging with his family and friends after the incident.

After much coaxing, the boy finally opened up to his family on Saturday. The family then approached police, following which a medical test was also conducted on the 17-year-old. An FIR was registered under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 147 (rioting) of the Indian Penal Code at the Sushant Lok 1 police station.

The boy told his family that when he was returning from a birthday party on July 23, the group stopped him and asked him to apologise to a particular boy. What happened before this, and why they demanded an apology is not known. The family said that incident took place in Sushant Lok 1. A video of the assault, which the family shared with TOI, shows the accused tearing up the boy’s T-shirt and asking him to say sorry multiple times.

The video also shows the boy being shoved around and thrashed even as he starts apologising. He is then made to repeat after them that he will say sorry for what he has done. At least two boys in the group recorded the assault on their cellphones.

The family said that when the boy reached home, his clothes were torn but when asked, he vaguely referred to an incident at the party. He stopped stepping out of the house after this.

On Saturday, his mother took to social media and narrated the incident. She wrote, “A group of teens viciously attacked & tortured my 17-year-old son physically, mentally & emotionally on July 23 at Peach Tree, Sushant Lok. My son did not retaliate or fight back or even attempt to call anyone as he knew his life was in danger and he was outnumbered. He was too scared to even inform his own family as he thought that if he told anyone, the boys will thrash him again.”

The boy’s aunt told TOI an FIR had been registered. “As soon as we found out about the incident, we went to the police to file a complaint. My nephew was taken for a medical examination on Saturday and his statement was also recorded in front of the magistrate,” she said, adding the boy was traumatised and it seemed to be a case of “teenage jealousy”.

Asked if he knew any of the accused, she said he had interacted with them on social media platforms, but never in person. “Some of them he did not even know,” the aunt said.

Police sources said that boy had said something about the person he was being asked to apologise to on a social media platform.

This led to animosity between them and the other boy confronted him with his friends to take revenge for his insult on social media, a police officer said, adding the investigation was on.

Police are yet to confirm the age of all the accused.

249,['16/08/2020'],Grocer a director in Chinese online gambling firm,"HYDERABAD: How did a small-time grocer from Delhi become a director in a Chinese company that allegedly ran an illegal online gambling racket in India worth more than Rs 1,000 crore?

Neeraj Tuli, one of the three Indian directors held along with a Chinese national, told police in Hyderabad that he was a grocer who ran a small neighbourhood shop in Delhi’s Karol Bagh area. He claimed he had no clue that his name was being used to run the company and found out about it only when the police arrived at his doorstep.

Tuli accused his chartered accountant neighbour P Hemant of tricking him into signing some documents which made him part of the business. Officials are on the lookout for Hemant, who is missing.

“Tuli claimed Hemant, under the pretext of helping him audit his accounts, got many documents signed by him. It is true that Tuli is a grocer, but we are not taking his claims at face value. He will be questioned further,’’ said an officer.

Investigators are believed to have produced documents in Tuli’s name which declared him a director of various firms operating under Beijing T Power based out of China. The eight firms — Growing Info Tech Pvt Ltd , Sily Consulting Services Pvt Ltd, Pan Yun Technology Services, Linkyun Technology Pvt Ltd , Dokypay Technology Pvt Ltd, SpotPay Technology India Pvt Ltd , Daisylink Financial Pvt Ltd and Huahuo Financial Pvt Ltd — were registered in India either in 2019 or 2020.

All the firms belong to Beijing T Power, which was establishing new companies and running online gambling by admitting members only through references. Payment was accepted through e-payment gateways such as PayTM and Cash Free, investigators said.

255,['16/08/2020'],"Rains continue across Telangana, emergency operations in full swing","Overflowing water from Waddepally lake flooded roads and colonies in Warangal on Saturday

HYDERABAD: A massive rescue operation was launched by the Indian Air Force at Kundanpally village in Telangana 's Jayashankar Bhupalpally district, on Saturday, after 10 farmers were left stranded in the floodwaters. It took two IAF helicopters, pressed into action on orders from minister K T Rama Rao, close to four hours to bring the farmers to safety.

The incident took place when the farmers went to retrieve the motors from their agricultural wells around 10am. Before they realised, the stream connecting their farmland started overflowing due to heavy rains forcing them to climb onto a tree to take shelter. From there, the farmers made multiple calls to the police and relatives. Pushed into action, villagers alerted the local MLA Gandra Venkata Ramana Reddy and panchayat raj minister, Errabelli Dayakar Rao, who in turn got in touch with KT Rama Rao.

On KTR's orders, chief secretary Somesh Kumar coordinated the rescue. Two IAF helicopters arrived around 2pm and later dropped them at an agriculture field nearby.

In another incident near Baswapur bridge in Siddipet's Koheda mandal, a lorry driver, M Shankar, went missing after his vehicle was washed away by the flood water early on Saturday morning. While the IAF was called in here too, the chopper could not take off from Hakimpet on time owing to bad weather. When the team finally arrived at the site 11.45am, the driver was 'missing', said local authorities. The mishap occured when Shanker (45) and a cleaner were heading from Siddipet to Husnabad. S Mahender, ACP Husnabad , said, ""The driver was travelling in a sand lorry when a stream nearby was in spate at 5.30am. Caught in it, he held onto a tree waving to villagers to rescue him."" As news reached finance minister Harish Rao, he ordered the police commissioner and NDRF to launch a rescue operation to save the man. ""But in the meantime, the man tried to crossover the floodwaters and villagers lost sight of him,"" the ACP added.

In a third incident in Karimnagar, a woman police officer led a team to rescue a biker stranded on a flyover in Huzurabad police stations limits, late on Friday. Mahender, who works in a wine shop, was stuck on a causeway while returning home after his stock arrived late. Stranded with water from a stream gushing, Mahender was holding on to his bike and a pillar for support for nearly an hour. Alerted about the incident, inspector Madhavi led a six-member team that reached the spot around an hour later. ""The team members used a stick to check the depth of the floodwaters. Each member using a rope to lead one another on. When we reached near Mahender, we threw the rope at him and he was rescued,"" confirmed one police official involved in the operation.

267,['16/08/2020'],"Maharashtra: Inter-district ST buses, SOPs for tuition classes likely in one week","<p>Vijay Wadettiwar (File Photo)<br></p>

MUMBAI: A day after relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said the state government would likely allow indoor gyms to reopen in a couple of days, he said the state was considering allowing inter-district ST (state transport) bus services and SoPs (standard operating procedures) were being drawn to start coaching classes in some parts of the state.

“A decision will be taken in the next one week. A discussion was held on this issue, and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is very positive about it,” Wadettiwar said in Chandrapur .

Unclear if private cars could now skip e-passes

Inter-district travel is currently restricted in the state and one requires an e-pass for it. The only exception the Thackeray government made was to allow ST buses to the Konkan and unregulated movement between the different districts in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. ST bus services within a district have been permitted since June.

Wadettiwar said ST buses will run with only 20 passengers so that there is no crowding and social distancing can be maintained, and guidelines to this effect were being readied.

He, however, was not clear about whether private vehicles too would be allowed to travel between districts without an epass. He said many students from cities have the means to start digital education, but there are many from rural areas for whom this is not possible. “We are working on framing guidelines so that coaching classes can be started in some districts. There are many places where students cannot attend online classes,” Wadettiwar said.

NEW DELHI: Former India opener Chetan Chauhan’s fight against Covid-19 has become grim. He was put on life support on Saturday afternoon in a Gurugram hospital on Saturday as his health deteriorated.

The 73-year-old, a serving Cabinet minister in the Yogi government in Uttar Pradesh, was diagnosed with the virus on July 12 in Lucknow. His brother Pushpender Chauhan told TOI he was brought to the Medanta Hospital in Gurugram as his organs started to get affected.

“He had recovered from the virus but his kidneys got affected. He tested positive again last night. His health started deteriorating in the morning and we were told that he was suffered from multiple-organ failure. Thus, he was put on life support at around 1 pm. He has responding to the treatment and has not shown any sign of further deterioration,” Pushpender said on Saturday evening.

According to sources at the hospital, Chauhan is suffering from candida fungal infection and pancreatitis. “He is on a ventilator. He is critical as he is not maintaining blood pressure. There is inflammation of pancreas and candida fungal infection on his entire body,” said a source from the hospital.

Chauhan was very active in community service during the pandemic. “He has been a very fit man even at this age. He was in the middle of social service during the pandemic when he contracted the disease. Hopefully, he will pull through this,” Pushpender added.

Chauhan represented India in 40 Test matches and scored 2084 runs before becoming a two-time member of parliament.

269,['16/08/2020'],Hyderabad: Grocer a director in Chinese company running gambling racket,"Representative image

HYDERABAD: How did smalltime grocer from Delhi become a director in a Chinese company that allegedly ran an illegal online gambling racket in India worth more than Rs 1,000 crore?

Police officers in Hyderabad are trying to answer this question after Neeraj Tuli, one of the three Indian directors held along with a Chinese national, told investigators that he was just an ordinary grocer who ran a small neighbourhood shop as an extension of his home in Delhi’s Karol Bagh area. He claimed he had no clue that his name was being used to run the company and found out about it only when cops reached his doorstep.

Tuli accused his chartered accountant neighbor, P Hemant, of tricking him into signing some documents which made him part of the business without his knowledge. Officials are on the lookout for Hemant who is missing.

“Tuli claimed that Hemant, under the pretext of helping him audit his accounts, got many documents signed by him. He said he did not know that Hemant would use them to make him a dummy director in Chinese firms. It is true that Tuli is a grocer, but we are not taking his claims at face value. He will be grilled further,’’ said a senior officer.

8 firms registered in India between ‘19 & ‘20

Investigators are believed to have produced various documents in Tuli’s name, which declared him a director of various firms operating under Beijing T Power based out of China.

The eight firms – Growing Info Tech Pvt Ltd, Sily Consulting Services Pvt Ltd, Pan Yun Technology Services, Linkyun Technology Pvt Ltd, Dokypay Technology Pvt Ltd, SpotPay Technology India Pvt Ltd, Daisylink Financial Pvt Ltd and Huahuo Financial Pvt Ltd — were registered in India either in 2019 or 2020. All the firms belong to Beijing T Power, which was establishing new companies and running online gambling by admitting members only through references. Payment was accepted through different e-payment gateways.

The two other directors —Dheeraj Sarkar and Ankit Kapoor — were aware of the cheating, police said. “The key accused, Chinese national Yah Hao and Hemant officially have not been directors in any of these firms in India. But, they ran India operations and ensured transfer of hundreds of crores rupees to China,’’ an official added. English-speaking Yah Hao is generally tasked with studying the market potential in various countries.

Also, in the last 21 days, the state has discharged nearly 2 lakh people, taking the rate of recovery from 56.5% on July 25 to 70% as on August 14.Senior officials said the increase in recovery rate was an indicator that the treatment and drug protocol had been streamlined and was working. “Over five months into the pandemic , treatment protocols are stable. This has increased recoveries and cut patients’ hospital time,” an official said.With recovies being swifter in Maharashtra of late, state officials said oxygen is given early on now to patients, and fewer critical patients are coming in.Maharashtra had a slow start in recoveries. It took 116 days since the first case was reported in the state on March 9 to cross the first 1 lakh discharges, while the journey from 1 lakh to 2 lakh took 23 days and as on July 25, the state had 2.07 lakh recoveries in all. On August 5, in just 11 days, the state reported 3.05 lakh discharges and in just nine days, the 4 lakh mark was breached on August 14.According to data, August has been a good month for recoveries, and there have been days when the number of discharges have been higher than the additions. Also, in the first 14 days of the month, over 1.5 lakh new Covid-19 cases were added and 1.45 lakh people were sent home, while in all of July, 2.5 lakh new cases were added and 1.65 lakh people discharged.Officials said apart from treatment and protocol, another thing that helped increase discharges was a revision in the discharge policy in May which did away with the need to do a repeat test before sending a person home.Mumbai also reported a total of 1 lakh discharges on August 12, and as on August 14, its recovery rate was over 79%, with 1.01 lakh recoveries. There are fewer than 20,000 active cases in Mumbai. AMC Suresh Kakani said in five months, public hospitals have learnt the drill well. “We have protocols, oxygen beds and medicines needed to treat patients,” he noted.In Mumbai, the task force on mortality had advised that providing oxygen to patients early (or immediately on admission to hospital) could cut down severity. This led to an effort to add oxygen support to beds. “In many cases, providing oxygen early on cut down the need for transfer to ICU,” said a civic doctor.A doctor from Sion Hospital said not only are daily admissions down, the number of patients coming with serious symptoms too has also come down. “It is no longer like it was in May-June when most patients came to hospitals with elevated blood sugars or low oxygen count,” he said.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77568968,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1420712,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/treatment-protocol-working-last-one-lakh-patients-in-maharashtra-recover-in-9-days/articleshow/77568964.cms

MUMBAI: While the death rate of 5.47% in Mumbai seems worrisome, BMC officials said July had shown an impressive drop compared to the previous months. “While the death rate or case fatality rate was 5.8% at the end of June, our efforts to ensure speedy detection and treatment resulted in case fatality rate for July falling to 4.8%,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani.

The number of cases up between March and June stood at 77,658, including 4,556 deaths. In July, BMC registered 35,139 cases including 1,722 deaths, working out to a case fatality rate of 4.8%. In June, the BMC added over 800 deaths on a single day in a data reconciliation exercise.

On Saturday, Mumbai’s overall CFR was 5.47% -- much higher than the national 1.94%. The CFR for Maharashtra is 3.38%.

“In August, we realized that the deaths in the public sector hospitals are going down while deaths in private hospitals are climbing,” said Kakani. The BMC has hence decided to hold a review meeting on Monday of deaths in private sector hospitals between August 1 and 15.

Dr Shashank Joshi , who is a member of the state task force on Covid-19, said that the target should be to reduce the deaths to 1% of the total cases. “The CFR should be below 1% across India if Covid-19 has to be converted into a manageable disease. We are making all-out efforts that include prompt diagnosis and treatment, including teh aggressive control of comorbidity among patients,” said Dr Joshi.

274,['16/08/2020'],Hospitals inflating Covid bills: Insurers' body,"BENGALURU: The General Insurance Council — an association of non-life insurance companies — has accused hospitals where cashless insurance is available, of inflating bills for Covid-19 treatment . The council has called for regulation of healthcare fees and is seeking to become a party to a Supreme Court petition on cashless servicing of Covid treatment claims.Speaking to TOI, GI Council head M N Sharma said, “We see medical inflation where hospitals artificially jack up rates. Now, insurance companies can’t follow suit because we are regulated. Every policy we issue, the rates are approved by IRDAI. So we cannot unfairly price our products, even if hospitals are doing so.”The council is demanding the government set caps on Covid-19 treatment costs. Stating that private hospitals are arbitrarily charging patients, the GI Council is likely to implead itself in a petition filed in the Supreme Court as it has noticed differential charges for patients with insurance cover and those without insurance cover. The SC PIL (public interest litigation) was originally filed by a hospital victim Avishek Goenka, a resident of Kolkata, stating the problems faced by the common man. GI Council is likely to implead itself in Goenka’s petition.The PIL also mentions discrepancy in hospital charges between patients with insurance and those without. “It has come to our attention — from hospital bills that some hospitals decide the treatment procedure based on the sum insured of the policy. Say for example, the sum insured is up to Rs 5 lakh; you will find the hospital charging a sum of Rs 4.9 lakh. Whereas for patients without insurance, the bill might be half or a quarter of that.”CHENNAI: The Centre should legislate a law prohibiting candidates with criminal backgrounds from participating in polls, the Madras HC has observed, reports Suresh Kumar.Citing a 2019 report of Association for Democratic Reforms, the HC said, “The report reveals that 43% (233 out of 539) of elected MPs are facing criminal cases.

275,['16/08/2020'],Coronavirus in Mumbai: Rs 22 lakh bill Covid patient remembers little of her 54-day ordeal,"Some Covid-19 patients need a longer stay in hospitals than usual 15-21 days

MUMBAI: Eleven kilos, 54 days and Rs 22 lakh. This was the total cost involved in getting 50-year-old Kalyan resident Minaz Baig back on her feet after fighting Covid-19 and its several complications.

While Juhu’s Nanavati Hospital completely waived off Baig’s bill, there was one price not factored here: Memories.

Baig, who weighed 84kg earlier and is now 73kg, remembers being rushed to the hospital on June 11. Her next memory is that of a nurse telling her it is July 8. “I thought I was in slumber for 24 hours and was shocked to hear so many days had passed,” said Baig, wife of a fast food vendor from Kalyan.

The average hospital stays for patients with Covid-19—the viral outbreak that has over the past five months changed the way Mumbaikars live and work —ranges from 15 to 21 days, depending on the severity of their symptoms.

But as Baig’s experience shows the ordeal can stretch much longer in some of the 1.3 lakh Covid patients in the city so far.

Consider Vasai-based grandmother Raji Nair (not her real name) who spent 46 days in the BMC-run Seven Hills Hospital in Andheri. She lost a son to Covid before being diagnosed with the condition herself and getting admitted with four of her family members.

Seven Hills dean Dr B Adsul remembers a patient who stayed for three months as the relatives he was visiting in Mumbai abandoned him. “We had to get social workers to help him travel back to Uttar Pradesh,” said Dr Adsul.

The problem with longer stays, as Nair’s grandson Ramith, who was admitted alongside her for 15 days, said is that the stress and uncertainly get multiplied too. “Apart from her health, we were also concerned as my 83-year-old grandmother only speaks Malayalam and doesn’t know how to use a mobile phone,” he said. On one occasion, her family said the nurses forgot to lock her IV drip and she bled profusely all over the bedsheet. Also, she was shifted to three different wards and developed urinary tract infection as no one remembered to change her catheter in over 40 days.

Clearly, the biggest problem with longer hospital stays is the threat of secondary bacterial or fungal infections. Dr Abdul Ansari, who heads the intensive care at Nanavati Hospital, said Baig was brought to the hospital in a critical state. “She had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) when she was brought here from a local Kalyan hospital,” he said.

Baig, who tested positive for the virus six times, needed all the medicines used for Covid ICU patients: Tocilizumab, Favipiravir and Remdesivir. “We would get calls from Nanavati Hospital three times a day, sometimes to ask if she could be started on a new medicine,” said her nephew Tariq Don.

It is the nature of this viral infection, Dr Ansari said, to lead to complications.

“If a patient gets admitted late, they have a high risk of developing cytokine storm (a complicated immune response from the body) and ARDS,” he said. If appropriate medicines are delayed, the patient’s condition could worsen and lead to organ failure as well. “In some patients, bleeding complications occur,’’ said the doctor.

On the 11th day of her hospitalization, Baig needed a tracheostomy, a medical procedure to create an opening in the neck for the windpipe to allow air to enter the lungs. Her creatinine shot up, indicating kidney problems. This was when the course of the then newly available drug, Remdesivir, was started.

As she slowly recovered enough to be weaned off the ventilator, she was diagnosed with a fungal infection that required her to be given some of the most powerful antibiotics. “She even developed a drug-resistant urinary tract infection a few days before discharge,” said Dr Ansari.

Baig, though, remembers her hospital stay fondly. “I couldn’t see the faces of the doctors or the nurses as they wore masks but I could recognize their voices. And they were very considerate to me,” she said.

Ramith, too, said barring the two incidents, the Seven Hills stay was fruitful. “The doctors would get irritated with our calls, but they healed my grandmother and she is able to walk again,” he added.

278,['16/08/2020'],Noida: Four kids injured as wall &amp; awning collapse,"Police said that they have not received any complaints from the families yet

NOIDA: Four children were injured after a portion of the terrace wall and an awning next to it came crashing down a three-storey house at Harola on Saturday evening. The debri fell on a parked autorickshaw and injured two children who were sitting inside it.

Three injured children were taken to the district hospital and doctors said one of them has serious injuries.

Police said that the incident took place around 5 pm when five-year-old Manav and a few other children were flying kites on the terrace of the three-storey house. The building is owned by Jagdish alias Jaggi and the children are from the tenant families.

While Manav was standing next to the terrace wall when it collapsed, along with the awning, Aman (14) and Utkarsh (3) were seated inside an auto rickshaw that was parked in front of the house.

They were playing games on mobile phones when the debri fell on them. Another child, Vikas (14), who was nearby was also injured.

A local resident said that the structure had cracks. The auto rickshaw on which it fell and a bike parked next to it were damaged.

“Aman and Utkarsh were inside the auto playing games on phone when the structure came crashing,” he said.

Sector 20 SHO Rakesh Kumar Singh said that the owner of the building stays in Noida Sector 19. Several rooms on the three floors of the building have been rented out. Most of the tenants are daily wage labourers.

“Manav escaped major injuries,” the officer said.

While Manav and Aman are brothers, Utkarsh is the son of one of the tenants named Pintu.

Manav has suffered injuries on the limbs and Utkarsh has got multiple fractures in the legs. Doctors said his condition is serious.

Manav and Aman have been discharged from the hospital and Vikas was taken to a private clinic where he got a few stitches.

Police said that they have not received any complaints from the families yet.

279,['16/08/2020'],"US dream shattered, Indians find greener pastures in Canada","Canadian application process much easier: NRIs

HYDERABAD: After waiting in vain for decades to obtain permanent residency ( green card ) and realise their ‘Great American Dream’, many Indian families are relocating to Canada. Reasons: Ease of entry, better career opportunities and convenience of settling down. Rough estimates suggest at least 20,000 Indians make this migration — from the US to Canada — every year.“I went through at least six H-1B visa extensions since I joined work. I was living in constant stress,” said Dinesh Dasari, a native of Hyderabad, who moved from Maryland to Toronto this July. This, after a 14-year-long stint in the US. The solutions architect said his career had stagnated because of the delay in getting a green card. “A person’s green card petition is stuck to the employer. This makes it difficult for you to switch jobs,” said Dasari. “Even moving to a managerial position is difficult because employers are sceptical about grooming and investing in a person who they are not sure will be able to stay in the country,” he added.The immigration of thousands of Indians comes at a time when the community has been lobbying for the passage of the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act of 2019, better known as S386, in the Senate. The bill seeks to end the cap for job-based green cards in the US. Currently, there is a 7% cap on Indians for issuing a green card every year, creating a huge backlog.There are approximately 9,00,000 Indians (holding H-1B, L1 and H4 EAD) in the US. When people ask me if they should stay or move, I always suggest the latter,” said immigration attorney Rahul Reddy of Reddy & Neumann, PC, adding the express entry to Canada has made it possible for people to get PR in less than a year. “People can simply apply online without even consulting an immigration attorney,” he said.Among those who made use of this opportunity is Girish Chavan. He bid Pittsburgh — his home of 18 years — goodbye and shifted to Toronto in July. The IT professional’s first green card application was rejected in 2010 over a small technicality. “Once the next application was in place, I always thought the green card would be right around the corner, but it never was,” said the native of Mumbai.Visa restrictions meant a series of setbacks for Chavan and his wife, including not being able to work for the company they planned to start and not being able to shift to another job when Chavan wanted to move to New York. The final straw was when Chavan’s wife -- who was representing the US at a high profile summit abroad – returned to find a letter suggesting the renewal for her H4 EAD (dependent visa which allows you to work) needed additional information, a constant irritant for most immigrants who have to keep proving how skilled they are. Canadian application process was a stark contrast in terms of ease. “There was an open line of communication with authorities, something that was missing in the US,” said Chavan. Since their move to Canada, the duo could not be more happier, having received a welcome and the freedom to choose their work.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77569027,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-208221,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyderabad-us-dream-shattered-indians-find-greener-pastures-in-canada/articleshow/77568990.cms

BENGALURU: Preliminary forensic findings from tests on burnt vehicles show that the mob had carried inflammable liquids, indicating that Tuesday night’s violence in the eastern part of the city, which initially appeared to be spontaneous may have actually been planned.

The Forensic Science Laboratory team found traces of petrol, diesel, kerosene and paint thinner in samples they collected on Wednesday. “Prima facie, these liquids were used to set vehicles on fire. This shows the mob had come prepared to torch vehicles,” an investigating officer told STOI. The final report is expected soon.

The findings came on a day a fourth person connected to the violence died in hospital. Sayyad Nadeem, 24, a resident of KG Halli, was injured in the chest and neck by a tear gas shell, police said.

Violence over FB post

Rioters forced open fuel tanks of 13 bikes and vans

The injuries were deep and Nadeem was unconscious when we traced him. He had lost a lot of blood,” a source said, adding that autopsy confirmed he had no bullet injuries.

Police said Nadeem was spotted in the frontline of rioters, torching vehicles parked outside the police station. The forensic findings said of the 35 police vehicles torched, traces of kerosene and thinner were found in more than 20. The investigation also showed that in 13 vehicles, including bikes and vans, the rioters had forced open fuel tanks.

Burning of KSRP van

While reconstructing events that night, investigators found that the mob had strategically blocked off a KSRP van before burning it down.

“There was one fire tender standing by at DJ Halli police station while another one near KJ Halli station. There was only one way in and out of the place, a small lane that deviates from Tannery Road leading to DJ Halli police station,” an officer said. The mob walked along with the KSRP vehicle until it entered this narrow lane and blocked it just about 500m from the police station. They then manhandled personnel in the van, the officer added.

The fourth victim, Nadeem, worked as an air-conditioner mechanic and lived with his parents, wife and three children near Anwar Layout. Police said he was part of the mob that picketed KG Halli police station and was spotted torching vehicles.

BENGALURU: Monitoring people in home quarantine continues to be a tough task for BBMP and its staff.

On August 3, a Hoodi man who had recovered from Covid-19 and was under home quarantine, set out to meet his friends and argued with a quarantine monitoring volunteer who tried to stop him. He not only hung out with his friends but also tried to shoo away the coordinator of Citizen Quarantine Squad.

According to senior officials in-charge of home quarantine, people need to be responsible and follow protocol. “We have created many monitoring squads and each of them is doing its best to manage the situation, but people need to have a sense of responsibility towards their neighbours, which is lacking,” a senior BBMP official told STOI. Nearly 45% of youngsters breach quarantine rules for fun, while 30% do so for essential purchases . The rest have a poor understanding of rules, added the official.

At a recent meeting of BBMP officials and resident welfare associations, many RWAs expressed concern over home quarantine and the related rules. “There is a lot of confusion. People want to know if they can go back to their hometowns for home quarantine. Many people step out to purchase essentials since everything isn’t accessible via home delivery,” said Manjunath J, special commissioner, estates and in-charge of home quarantine, BBMP.

Another official blamed poor arrangements by BBMP and the government for the confusion. “...There are many things one needs other than groceries. Due to the stigma, lying comes naturally to those in home quarantine,” he explained “We have noticed people leaving their mobiles at home or giving wrong numbers to avoid being tracked,” added Manjunath.

The tiger population has increased in India,” said Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day speech while announcing how similar projects for Asiatic lions and dolphins, living in the rivers and in the seas, would give a boost to biodiversity and create employment opportunities.Underlining that the country is committed towards promotion and conservation of its biodiversity, Modi said, “India has shown that the march towards development is possible by balancing the environment"".Gangetic river dolphin, declared as a National Aquatic species in 2010, act as ideal ecological indicators of a healthy riverine ecosystems. It’s a species of freshwater dolphins primarily found in the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers and their tributaries in India, Bangladesh and Nepal.At present, there are about 3,700 Gangetic river dolphins in the Indian river systems. These dolphins are sighted along deep river reaches in Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.

NEW DELHI: The Tejas fighter jet and the recently-announced negative arms imports list came in for special mention by Prime Minister Modi as part of the “Atmanirbhar Bharat” initiative, even as an indigenous anti-drone system was deployed to guard against small aerial threats during the Independence Day function at Red Fort in the capital.

The PM also announced one lakh new NCC cadets — one-third of them girls — from the 173 districts on the land borders as well as the coastline will be trained by the armed forces in the coming days. This will make trained manpower available in these areas for disaster management, while the youth will also get skill training for making a career in the armed forces.

The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) said the new anti-drone system that was deployed near the Red Fort can bring down “micro drones” by either jamming their command and control links or damaging their electronics through laser-based directed energy weapons.

“The system can detect and jam micro drones up to 3 km and lase a target up to 1-2.5 km depending on the wattage of the laser weapon. It can be an effective counter to increased drone activity in the western and northern border sectors,” said an official.

The PM, on his part, said “mammoth steps” are being taken in the defence production field. “Recently, we have put a stop on the import of more than 100 military equipment. From missiles to light military helicopters, from assault rifles to transport aircraft — all will be made in India,” said Modi.

“Our Tejas is getting ready to equip itself as per the modern requirements, for putting up a show of its majesty, speed and strength,” the PM added. The IAF has already raised two squadrons at the Sulur airbase in Tamil Nadu for the initial 40 Tejas Mark-1 fighters, only half of which have been delivered till now.

The contract for the next 83 Tejas Mark-1A fighters, which are slated to have 43 “improvements” over the first 40 jets, is set to be inked later this year, with deliveries beginning three years after that. The 123 jets will cost over around Rs 85,000 crore.

BENGALURU/HAVERI: The Congress in Karnataka on Saturday slammed home minister Basavaraj Bommai for saying internal party rift was a reason for the violence in East Bengaluru.

“How can Bommai come to such a conclusion? Is he an investigating officer? Is this the outcome of an inquiry? He’s doing it to cover up his failure?” said a furious KPCC president DK Shivakumar.

On Friday, Bommai alleged that internal squabbling in the Congress and SDPI’s larger conspiracy to disturb law & order resulted in the Pulakeshinagar constituency violence.

“The government failed to handle the situation. BJP workers are responsible for the violence. They had the opportunity to control the situation, but allowed it to flare up. Now, they are pointing fingers at us to hide their failure,” Shivakumar said. He alleged that the government is trying to threaten Congress corporators by issuing notices to them and pressurising MLA Akhanda Srinivasmurthy to issue certain statements. Bommai, who was in Haveri, said the allegations are baseless and they will extend police security to Srinivasamurthy and other MLAs facing threats.

BJP targets MLA Zameer

In Chikkamagaluru, tourism minister CT Ravi alleged that Chamarajpet MLA BZ Zameer Ahmed Khan orchestrated the violence with the support of some Congress leaders. “He is the director and producer of the violence,” he alleged. Congress leaders Tanveer Sait and Roshan Baig have lost their hold on the community and Zameer is looking to emerge as a leader, he added.

288,['16/08/2020'],"Asean nations, West Asia now our 'neighbours'","Frontline health workers in Kolkata refuse to allow the Covid pandemic beat their patriotic fervour on Saturda... Read More

NEW DELHI: PM Modi redefined the meaning of neighbours on Saturday, saying one didn’t have to share boundaries to be so, describing such ties as encompassing an extended neighbourhood.

The defining features of such ties could be “deep relations based on security, development and trust with our neighbouring countries, whether connected by sea or land.” Making the point, Prime Minister Modi said, “neighbours are not the only ones with whom we share geographical boundaries, but also those with whom we have close and harmonious relations.”

Translated in the present Indian context , India could see Japan or UAE as a neighbour, even while ties with Pakistan and China remain unsettled. In recent policy decisions, the government has imposed investment restrictions on certain countries with which India shares land borders, without actually describing them as “neighbours.” The target has been China principally.

“India has strengthened its relationship with all the countries in its extended neighbourhood in the last few years. The political, economic and human relations with the countries in West Asia have progressed manifold. Trust has increased manifold. The economic ties, particularly in the field of energy sector, are very important with these countries.” PM’s singling out the Gulf and West Asian countries is also interesting in the context of India’s growing ties with the Gulf countries, particularly UAE and Saudi Arabia.

The Prime Minister also took the opportunity to emphasise India’s ties with Asean countries, also regarded as India’s extended neighbourhood.

“Similarly, our Asean countries in the east, who are our maritime neighbours, also hold special importance. India has thousands of years old religious and cultural ties with these countries. The traditions of Buddhism connect us with them. Today, India is strengthening its cooperation not only in the field of security but also in the areas of marine wealth with these countries,” he said.

291,['16/08/2020'],"Bordering China &amp; Nepal, Uttarakhand boosts defence infra","DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand , which has a strategic location among the northern Himalayan states , shares a 350-km-long border with China and an almost 275-km-long border with Nepal. With both these border areas currently on high alert, the state government has taken a number of steps to ensure that these areas are safeguarded.

These include ramping up the number of helipads and setting up airstrips near border areas to facilitate ease of movement, besides earmarking funds for development. The state government has also drawn up plans to encourage reverse migration to villages in border areas that had in the past few years become empty.

Talking to TOI, chief minister T S Rawat said, “In the last few years, the perception of the government and people alike has changed towards the border areas. They have now become priority sectors.” He added that the number of helipads in the state have gone up from 20 to 50 and the Army has set up a walnut nursery in Chamoli district with the intent to check migration. “The state has now three active airstrips and has got in-principle approval for another airstrip in Almora,” he said.

Colonel (retired) Pradeep Goyal said that in the long run Uttarakhand’s efforts to build more helipads and airstrips will help the armed forces in emergency and crisis situations. In addition to air connectivity, Uttarakhand has also been working on ramping up road connectivity to border areas.

The CM said that the BRO has either completed or is on track to complete most of its projects in the state. “Due to the road made by BRO, it now takes less than three hours to reach Rimkhim from Joshimath, which earlier used to take almost 10 hours,” he added. Rimkhim incidentally is a strategic location close to the Barahoti area which had seen repeated incursions by China.

Meanwhile, defence analysts said that the state’s efforts to safeguard border areas are ‘in the right direction’, and it was important that “people-to-people relations in border areas especially those with Nepal are retained.”

The Forensic Science Laboratory has found traces of petrol, diesel, kerosene and paint thinner in samples collected from 20 of the 35 police vehicles set ablaze by the rioters, more than 200 of whom have been arrested.

“Prima facie, these substances were used to set fire to vehicles. This shows the mob had come prepared,” an investigating officer said.

While reconstructing the events, investigators found that the mob had “strategically blocked” a Karnataka State Reserve Police van before setting it ablaze. The KSRP team opened fire when things got out of hand, an officer said.

Meanwhile, a fourth person connected to the violence died in a hospital on Saturday. Sayyad Nadeem, 24, a resident of KG Halli, was injured by a tear gas shell, said police.

GURUGRAM: Facing stiff protest and continuous strikes from the roadways employees over the government’s plan to introduce private buses in its fleet, state transport minister Mool Chand Sharma has reached out to the workers and unions, urging them to quit their protest as the government is ready for “discussions”.

Earlier this week, the transport minister decided to discuss the issues of roadways employees. The minister appealed to the employees that they should not protest as a solution can be reached only through discussions.

“A meeting of all employees’ unions related to roadways will be held on September 2. During this meeting, the issues of the employees will be discussed and all their legitimate demands will be considered sympathetically. In the meantime, I appeal to all the employees and unions to call off their protest and prepare for the discussion instead,” said Sharma.The move comes at a time when the state roadways is grappling with acute revenue losses and repeated strikes of the employees against the privatisation drive of the government. While the protesting employees have welcomed the initiative, they are yet to decide whether or not the protests will be called off.

“We had planned to present a memorandum to the minister on September 5. It’s good that the minister himself has decided to call us and discuss the matter on the table. We are open to dialogue but the decision of calling of the protest is yet to be taken. We’ll call a meeting of our employees and discuss our line of action. We had planned a massive protest on August 18 and 25,” said Haryana Roadways Employees Union president Dalbir Kirmara.

The roadways employees, however, have expressed their reservations about the outcome of the discussion. “Previous discussions have not yielded any result. What happens is that selected people are called for the meeting but nothing concrete comes out of it,” argued Sudhir Ahlawat, district head of Haryana Roadways Sanyukt Karamchari Sangh.

We have a target of 1.25 crore plants for plantation during the year of 2020-21,” said Pal.

Russia and China voted against the proposal in the 15-member council, while 11 members abstained, including France, Germany and UK.

But for the Trump administration, the vote could open a separate path to try to inflict maximum damage on Iran ahead of US polls. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo suggested the US would invoke the “snap back” mechanism in the 2015 nuclear deal that would restore all UN sanctions on Iran. He said the rejection of the bid was a “serious mistake”. Iran hailed the vote, saying US has “never been so isolated”. President Rouhani said the US had failed to kill off the 2015 deal “with humiliation”.

Now he sees the Trump administration 's accusation that Yale discriminated against Asian American and white applicants , levelled against the university by the justice department on Thursday, as unfathomable . ""This is the oldest tactic in the book, to pit minority groups against each other,"" Shankar, 20, a junior majoring in economics , said.

Yale students widely criticised the administration's finding, which came two years after a complaint was filed against the university by a group called the Asian American Coalition for Education . Most said the administration had lost credibility on racial matters. ""It's not like people on campus were asking for this kind of justice that doesn't exist,"" said Alec Dai, a senior whose parents immigrated from China.

The justice department accused Yale of violating civil rights law by using race and ethnicity as a determining factor when sifting through the roughly 35,000 applications it reviews to admit about 2,300 students. Experts saw the finding as an extension of efforts to end race-based college admissions policies. Three Asian American students who were involved in the legal actions against Ivy League schools were reluctant to speak. They said they agreed with the ruling but were afraid of being slammed for their views. Zuri Goodman, 20, a Yale junior who is the child of an Indian-born mother and a white father, said: ""Race shouldn't be discarded; it should just be perhaps weighted less. I think what should be weighted in its place is class and wealth and the access that they allow.""

MUMBAI: There is once again a severe shortage of Tocilizumab, an anti-arthritis drug used to treat Covid-19, in the city.

A doctor from a south Mumbai hospital said it is “nearly impossible” to get the drug. “We have heard Roche pharma hasn’t been supplying the drug to Cipla, the Indian company distributing it here,” said a senior BMC official .

Both companies denied the charge. In an email reply, a spokesperson for Cipla said, “The demand is unprecedented and we are working closely with our global partners to ensure supplies of the drug.”

A spokesperson for Roche Products (India) said, “Currently, supplies are ensured for all approved indications of Tocilizumab. In India, Tocilizumab is approved for the treatment of various rheumatological disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, systemic and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, etc. Tocilizumab is currently not approved for treatment of Covid-19 in India or anywhere else in the world. There has been an unprecedented demand for Tocilizumab globally due to the pandemic.”

The BMC, too, has a limited supply of Tocilizumab, said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. “We hope to get some more on Monday and we are using the existing supply judiciously,” he said.

On July 29, Roche said its trial on the use of Tocilizumab for Covid-19 did not meet its “primary endpoint of improved clinical status in patients with Covid-19 associated pneumonia, or the key secondary endpoint of reduced patient mortality”.

A Chembur doctor said, “The supply problem began thereafter.” Incidentally, on Saturday, a study from Boston published in The Lancet medical journal said the drug reduced mortality in Covid patients in ICUs. “We have used Tocilizumab on many patients and have had quick recovery. It is an important drug in the fight against Covid,” said Dr Prince Surana whose hospital treats the patients.

MP Rahul Shewale wrote to the union health ministry on Saturday, requesting export of Tocilizumab be banned so that Indian patients are not deprived of the medicine.

Meanwhile, the case will be heard by Bombay high court as well as the state human rights commission on Monday.Relying on medical reports , the SIT, in its report to the state home department , has said Vijay Singh, the deceased, had a heart ailment. “SIT will continue to probe if there was any dereliction of duty or negligence in taking him to the hospital immediately after he fell ill,” said a police source .Singh was detained with his cousin and a friend after a tiff with a couple who accused him of harassing the woman.His family alleged police torture led to his death while in custody.

CHENNAI: After a gap of four months, international flights have resumed in a small way from Chennai airport with airlines slotting services to Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah. The state government has also waived seven days institutional quarantine for those who arrive with Covid-19 negative certificate.

Indigo and GoAir have released schedules from Chennai and SpiceJet from Madurai for flights to the UAE till the end of the month.

This will make it easier for people to reach UAE as getting seat in Vande Bharat flights being operated by Air India was not easy. The move comes after the ministry of civil aviation approved flights between airports under the ‘air bubble’ scheme.

The number of flights will be limited, as it's not daily service, because the state government continues to be concerned about the spread of Covid-19.

Nevertheless, the state government has relaxed institutional quarantine rules for international travellers.

As per the new rule, passengers who arrive from abroad with an Covid-19 test certificate will have to undergo another test here and can go on home quarantine if the result is negative. This means those who do not have Covid-19 infection may have to be in a hotel or a government facility for one or two days only.

There will be around seven flights by Indian carriers till August 30. UAE-based airlines too will be adding flights. With IPL to be held in Dubai, flight schedules for next month are expected to be released soon.

Sriharan Balan from Madura Travels said, “This is a good beginning. UAE has also started issuing tourist visas to Indians. A passenger flew the day before on a tourist visa to Dubai. He will be staying for a month with his friends.”

However, it would take longer for leisure travellers to visit UAE because they continue to insist on quarantine. “With IPL going to be held in UAE next month, this rule too may be relaxed and airlines are likely to schedule more flights,” he added Lufthansa too have scheduled flights to Bengaluru. However, only those who wish to fly to Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah can travel and people who want to fly beyond UAE cannot board these flights.

Basheer Ahmed of Metro Travels said, “The flights to the UAE will be of help to people who were struggling to get tickets on Vande Bharat flights. However, they should allow passengers who prefer to travel beyond Dubai or Abu Dhabi. This will offer more choice for people who want to fly to Europe from Chennai.""

RAJAHMUNDRY: With water level rising steadily in river Godavari thanks to incessant rains in the catchment areas, irrigation officials on Saturday sounded the first flood warning signal at Dowleswaram and Bhadrachalam, even as revenue authorities evacuated people in low-lying areas to safety.

With the Indian Meteorological Department forecasting moderate to heavy rainfall till Monday, inflows into Godavari are expected to rise further.

About 80 villages have been cut off from the mainland with flood water overflowing over link roads in East and West Godavari districts. The flood discharge from Dowleswaram barrage crossed the 10 lakh cusecs mark, necessitating issuance of flood warning signal. The second flood warning signal is expected to be issued on Sunday.

The Krishna river, on the other hand, is also in spate with flood discharge from the Prakasam barrage crossing 50,000 cusecs.

As flood level in Godavari is rising with copious inflows from its catchment in Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Telangana, people living in the twin Godavari districts are in the grip of fear. As many as 66 villages have been cut off and 10 villages submerged in East Godavari, whereas 19 tribal villages are cut off from the mainland in West Godavari district.

The situation is likely to worsen as heavy inflows are coming from the catchment areas of the river.

People from the tribal belt in the twin Godavari districts are shifting to hillocks to avoid flood waters. Flood water has also entered the spillway of Polavaram project. Necklace bund, being constructed to protect Polavaram main village from the floods, has witnessed overflowing and project authorities are making efforts to strengthen the bund.

More than 11.42 lakh cusecs is being discharged into the sea from Dowleswaram barrage as heavy inflows are coming from the tributaries of Godavari including Sileru, Sabari and Indravathi. About 27,000 cusecs is discharged from the Donkarayi project into Sabari.

The situation in four mandals under Chinturu ITDA limits is grim with flood water level rising by the hour.

314,['16/08/2020'],Madras HC lets CMRL encash Rs 142 crore worth guarantees of Russian company,"Madras high court

CHENNAI: In a major relief to CMRL, the Madras high court has permitted the agency to encash more than Rs 142 crore worth bank guarantees issued by Transtonnelstory-Afcons JV, a Russia based-company which was awarded contracts worth more than Rs 2,500 crore for construction of underground Metro stations in Chennai. CMRL initiated encashment due to delay and quality issues in completion of the projects by the company.

Justice N Sathish Kumar granted the relief to Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) while dismissing the plea moved by the Russian company. However, since the counsel for the company sought a week’s time to prefer an appeal against the order before a division bench, Justice Kumar instructed the CMRL to maintain status quo till August 21. CMRL was also granted liberty to encash the guarantees if appeal is not filed within that time.

The issue pertains to a resolution passed by CMRL to encash two bank guarantees issued by the company for Rs 25.77 crore dated October 16, 2018, and Rs 117.51 crore dated December 29, 2010, for the alleged delay caused by the company in completing the underground station construction and quality issues in the project.

Aggrieved, Transtonnelstory-Afcons JV, a joint venture of Transtonnelstroy Limited, Moscow and Afcons Infrastructure Limited, Mumbai, moved the high court seeking to restrain CMRL from encashing the guarantees.

The company bagged a contract to design and construct underground metro stations at Shenoy Nagar, Anna Nagar East, Anna Nagar Tower, Thirumangalam and associated tunnels for a price of Rs 1,030.99 crore. It inked a second contract worth Rs 1,566.81 crore to design and construct underground stations at Washermenpet, Mannadi, High Court, Chennai Central, Egmore and associated tunnels.

According to the company, despite mobilisation of necessary resources, there was a delay in commencement of work and attributed the delay to CMRL.

The petitoner said they requested CMRL to revise the key dates, but it declined the same and this issue became a dispute between the parties. Hence, the matter was referred to an arbitral tribunal for extension of time as well as for costs of the claim, the petitioner said.

Opposing the pleas, CMRL contended that despite numerous requests and reminders, the company failed to complete the outstanding works and fix snags to the satisfaction of CRML compelling it to encash the guarantee. Recording the submission, the judge held that the company has not made out any case for granting injunction against CMRL and dismissed the pleas.

VISAKHAPATNAM: In a shocking incident which, ironically, came to light when the country was celebrating its 74th Independence Day, a tribal man was forced to carry the body of his seven-year-old daughter for about three kilometres to reach his home in the Agency area of Visakhapatnam .

After the ambulance stopped some three kilometres from his village due to a dilapidated bridge, the inconsolable father walked home carrying his dead daughter in his arms, with his sobbing wife and two other relatives in tow. The incident, which happened on Friday, came to light on Saturday after the poignant photographs went viral on social media.

The bridge across a stream at Pariseela village near Kinchumanda Santabayalu junction in Dumbriguda mandal was damaged during cyclone Hudhud in 2014.

It has not been repaired till date despite locals bringing it to the notice of revenue officials several times. As the bridge is not fit for motor vehicles, tribals walk to their villages from there, the distance often ranging between two to 25 kilometres.

Locals said Gollori Babu Rao of Vayya village, in Kitalangi panchayat of Dumbriguda mandal, had admitted his seven-year-old daughter Elicha in Araku valley hospital where the girl died on Friday. Vayya village is around 22 kilometres from Araku valley. The family was provided an ambulance to take the body home, which stopped at the bridge, from where Babu Rao had to carry his daughter’s body home in his arms.

GSK did not respond to a request for its vaccine production plans.Sanofi shipped its first batches on July 22, three weeks earlier than in 2019.The CDC estimates flu killed between 24,000 and 62,000 last year.Widespread flu vaccination could thus help free up hospital beds, a vital public health measure to cushion the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.""I'm really worried about the autumn,"" Lawrence Gostin, a professor at Georgetown University , told AFP.Gostin recently wrote an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association calling for a flu vaccine offensive, including potentially mandatory vaccines at schools.""People aren't thinking about flu, they're thinking about Covid,"" he said.Americans are already among the most vaccinated peoples against the flu in the world: vaccination is recommended from the age of six months.Other countries, such as France, recommend it to people at risk of complications, including those 65 and older.As a result, 63 percent of children and 45 percent of adults were vaccinated in 2018-2019. In the over-65 age bracket, the figure was 68 percent.But this year, Americans might have to look at new places to receive their shots.""It's going to be hard for people to get their flu vaccinations because they usually get it at work or at school, but many workplaces and many schools are closed,"" said Gostin.Every year the World Health Organization and national health authorities select in February and March the four strains of influenza virus most likely to be in circulation the following winter in the northern hemisphere.Hundreds of millions of eggs -- the traditional medium for incubating viruses before inactivating them and making them into vaccines -- are delivered to laboratories, with production continuing through the spring, until syringes are filled in summer.In the United States, Sanofi carries out these processes in two factories in the states of Pennsylvania and New York.The same factories could produce a future vaccine against the coronavirus -- but for now there is no competition between the two, said Greenberg.At any rate, Washington has also given the company $2 billion to expand its production capacity.""There are no concerns for supply now,"" said Dave Ross, vice president of commercial operations in North America for Seqirus, adding that the firm was working with partners to ensure adequate vial and syringe production for future COVID-19 vaccines.There are some causes for optimism.Public health practices like social distancing and mask wearing put in place to stem the coronavirus should also reduce the spread of other respiratory illnesses including the flu.""All of those things hopefully will pay dividends and there'll be less flu around,"" said Henry Bernstein, a pediatrics professor at the Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine who is on a committee advising the CDC on immunization practices.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77569348,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-59349,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/amid-covid-19-crisis-flu-shot-makers-see-record-us-production/articleshow/77569349.cms

BEDMINSTER, United States: President Donald Trump said Saturday he will ""take a look"" at pardoning Edward Snowden , the former US intelligence contractor who revealed in 2013 that the US government was spying on its citizens.

Snowden, who has been living in exile in Russia since the revelations, has said he would like to return to the United States -- but only on the condition that he receive a fair trial.

Trump was asked during a press conference at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club if he was considering pardoning the former contractor.

He replied that he was ""not that aware"" of Snowden's situation -- but that he plans to look into it, calling the controversy a ""split decision.""

""Many people think that he should be somehow treated differently and other people think he did very bad things,"" the president said, adding: ""I'm going to take a look at that very strongly.""

It was a shift from the 2016 presidential campaign, when Trump said of Snowden, ""I think he's a total traitor and I would deal with him harshly.""

Snowden was praised as a whistleblower and privacy advocate by his defenders after he leaked information showing that agents from the National Security Agency (NSA) were carrying out widespread surveillance on citizens.

But the United States accuses him of endangering national security. A conviction on espionage charges could send him to prison for decades.

A push to have him pardoned by Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama , ultimately failed.

The results of the study were published in the Journal of Nutrition.The study was conducted over six weeks with 22 women, 12 aged 25-40 and 10 aged 60-75. For the blueberry-enriched diet, participants consumed the equivalent of 1.75 cups of fresh blueberries/day, given as freeze-dried blueberries (19 g in the morning and 19 g in the evening), along with their regular diet. Participants were also asked to avoid other foods rich in polyphenols and anthocyanins.Serum was obtained from the participants 1.5 hours after consuming the morning dose of blueberries. The researchers then investigated how the serum would affect muscle progenitor cell function through proliferation or cell number, capacity to manage oxidative stress and oxygen consumption rate or metabolism.The results showed the six-week blueberry-enriched serum obtained from the women aged 25-40 increased human muscle progenitor cell numbers in culture. There was also a trend toward a lower percentage of dead human muscle progenitor cells, suggesting resistance to oxidative stress, as well as increased oxygen consumption of the cells. There were no beneficial effects seen in the muscle progenitor cells treated with serum from participants aged 60-75 who consumed the blueberry-enriched diet.""The consequences associated with the deterioration of skeletal muscle are a loss of mobility, decreased quality of life, and ultimately, loss of independence. Currently, research on dietary interventions to support skeletal muscle regeneration in humans is limited.

Muscle mass decreases three to five per cent every decade after 30 years of age, and that rate increases over age 60.

MUMBAI: For the first time in the recent past, the state achieved the target of ‘zero tanker’ on Saturday, when no tanker was pressed into service to supply water to villages. On August 10, eight tankers had been pressed into service to provide water to six villages and 10 hamlets.

Information on the water supply and sanitation department’s website says that on August 15 last year, 2,391 tankers were used to supply water to 1,878 villages and 6,211 hamlets. The largest number of tankers (1,090) was deployed in Aurangabad division.

In 2001, NCP leader R R Patil, the then rural development minister had alleged that the powerful tanker lobby was creating artificial water shortage, then more than 10,000 tankers, mostly belonging to private contractors were used to provide water to villages, mostly in drought-hit Vidarbha and Marathwada regions. Then Patil had drafted an ambitious plan to achieve the target of ‘zero tanker’.

Subsequently, successive rural development ministers drafted plans for zero tanker, but there was no success. When Devendra Fadnavis prepared a plan for zero tanker, he drafted Jalyukta Shivar scheme to enhance underground water level, it did help to some extent, but it too did not work due to unprecedented drought in many districts. “It was a good plan to enhance underground water level, but due to drought, there was no desired success,” a senior bureaucrat told TOI.

The bureaucrat said that now, with a normal monsoon , most dams have adequate water stocks, even large number of ponds created during Fadnavis’s tenure are full. “We have achieved the ‘zero tanker’ target, it remains to be seen as to how long it continues,” he said.

But new research from the University of Plymouth has found that adolescents (640 of them from India) who made a promise to be truthful were less likely to ‘cheat’ than those who did not, even when they could not be found out. “Cheating in academic settings is a common problem world over,” says Pune-based psychologist Jahnavi Sunderarajan, who worked on the study with Patricia Kanngiesser, associate professor of psychology at the University of Plymouth.The study was prompted by a 2015 article on 750 students in Bihar being expelled for blatant cheating in an exam. “We wanted to examine the prevalence of dishonest behaviour among school children and develop methods to promote honesty,” says Jahnavi. Patricia explains that promises are ‘speech acts’ and create commitments by merely saying specific words.For the study, published in the Journal of Behavioral Decision Making, researchers used the method of voluntary promises to create an honour code using a dice game where students’ points and thereby rewards were directly proportional to the number of dots on the dice. Before the task, half the students were given a choice to promise to be truthful.Students in the promise group were told they would receive a higher pay-off — double the points per dot on the dice — if they promised to report honestly the number of dots they could see. Students in the control group had to do nothing regardless of whether they chose the lower or higher pay-off.“We found that statistically, over-reporting the number of dots on the dice was lower in the group that had made the promise,” says Sunderarajan. “The study suggests a verbal promise puts moral pressure on the child to be honest. Alternately, it could make them realize that by promising, they are winning the trust of the other person and breaking the promise could result in betrayal of that trust.”The findings suggest that if students are asked to sign an honour code at the beginning of the exam saying they would answer honestly it may reduce the prevalence of cheating, she says, adding, “However, as dishonesty is visible in children as young as those in preschool, this needs to be promoted from a young age.”Chennai-based psychiatrist Dr Kannan Gireesh also believes that children will reduce the amount they lie if they know they are “trusted and loved even if they fail”. “Empathy makes children want to connect,” he says.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77569393,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-336348,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/a-promise-may-stop-kids-from-cheating/articleshow/77569385.cms

324,['16/08/2020'],The US presidential election: All you want to know,"WASHINGTON : The American presidential election takes places every four years on the Tuesday following the first Monday in November, as spelled out in the US Constitution. This year it will fall on November 3.Here is a primer on the US election system:The vote, by universal suffrage, is conducted in a single round in all 50 states and the District of Columbia (the city of Washington, which is not part of any state).Residents of the five US territories including Puerto Rico are eligible to vote in congressional elections and presidential primaries, but not in the presidential election.Voters choose among the candidates for president and vice president. The popular vote in each state determines the selection of a set of members of the Electoral College, who pledge to support a given candidate.The US presidential race is not determined directly by the popular vote, but by a majority of the Electoral College, a group of officials with the task of choosing the president.There are 538 members of the Electoral College, with the number from each state determined by its population size.A state has one elector for each of its members of the House of Representatives, and one for each of the state's two senators. The District of Columbia has three electors.California, the most populous state, thus has the largest number of electors (55), while Texas has 38, and New York and Florida have 29 each. At the other end of the spectrum, lightly populated Alaska, Delaware, Vermont and Wyoming have the minimum of three electors each.Members of the Electoral College officially elect the president and vice president in December, the month after the election, in what is a mere formality.The successful candidate must amass 270 electoral votes, an absolute majority of the 538 electors.In all but two states, the candidate who carries the majority of the popular vote wins the support of all the state's electors. Nebraska and Maine use a split system, in which two electors are chosen by popular state-wide vote and the remainder are chosen according to the popular vote in each congressional district The winner-take-all system in the states makes it extremely hard for third-party candidates to prevail, although they can still have critical impacts on certain states -- and therefore on the national result.Some states historically support the Democratic candidate election after election, while others are just as resolutely Republican. Candidates thus concentrate their efforts on about a dozen states prone to shift back and forth between the parties, often determining the final result.The most important of these are the ""battleground"" or ""swing"" states with the largest number of electors, like Florida (29), Pennsylvania (20) and Ohio (18).Americans are also voting for every one of the 435 members of the House of Representatives (who serve two-year terms) and, this year, for 35 of the 100 senators (who serve for six years).They are choosing governors in 11 states and two territories, and casting votes in a multitude of referenda and local elections for positions including judges, sheriffs, state treasurers and county executives.This year's election is being contested under extraordinary circumstances, namely a coronavirus pandemic that has essentially shut down in-person campaigning and prompted states to implement social distancing guidelines at polling stations.Fears of spreading and contracting the virus have sparked tremendous interest in mail-in voting as a way to avoid the risks associated with large crowds at polling places.Rules vary by state, but absentee or vote-by-mail ballots must be postmarked or received by Election Day.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77569401,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-70961,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/the-us-presidential-election-all-you-want-to-know/articleshow/77569402.cms

CHENNAI: Police on Friday and Saturday arrested five, including college students, for possession of and peddling ganja . Officers said three men picked up from MGR Nagar on Friday were involved in a racket operating in Virugambakkam and Neelankarai and seized about 5kg of the contraband and two bikes.

Police identified the accused as Bhaskar of Maduravoyal, C Sathish, 20, of Nesapakkam, a college student, and K Muthupandi, 23, of Nesapakkam, a food delivery boy. The team first caught Muthupandi and on investigation found that Bhaskar had smuggled liquor and ganja from Vellore and gave them to Muthupandi and Sathish to sell. Police seized at least 380g of ganja and 10 liquor bottles from them.

An investigating officer said the men packed the liquor and ganja like it was takeaway food and delivered the contraband to those who would place orders over phone.

Late on Saturday night, the Neelankarai police secured two men who were heading for a friend’s birthday party on a two-wheeler. A search of the vehicle led to the seizure of 36 sachets of ganja each weighing about 10g. The men were identified as V Hemanth, 26, of Vettuvankani, an LLB student, and C Sathish, 28, an employee at a private bank in T Nagar. The bike and ?8,000 were also seized.

A prohibition enforcement team from T Nagar nabbed a man in Virugambakkam and seized 1.1kg ganja. The accused C Sakthivel, 20, of Ambattur was secured near Chinmaya Nagar bridge on Friday evening based on a tip and handed over to the Virugambakkam police. A court sent all five arrested to jail.

CHENNAI: All banks in the state will work normal hours with 50% staff on rotation basis from Monday, August 17. Usual banking services will also be provided.

The state-level bankers committee decided to reduce staff strength and deploy them in rotation following representations from employees who found it difficult to report to work as there was no public transport due to the lockdown.

A public sector bank official said, “We also wanted clarity on the state government’s SOP as its order said all private offices and establishments have been allowed to function with 75% workforce. However, no specific guideline was sent to us (banks).”

The Tamil Nadu government, which has extended the lockdown till August 31, in its last order said the ban on public and private bus transport services, malls, gymnasiums and cinema halls will continue.

328,['16/08/2020'],"Robert Trump death: Robert Trump, the president's younger brother, dead at 71","NEW YORK: President Donald Trump 's younger brother, Robert Trump , a businessman known for an even keel that seemed almost incompatible with the family name, died Saturday night after being hospitalized in New York, the president said in a statement. He was 71.

The president visited his brother at a New York City hospital on Friday after White House officials said he had become seriously ill.

It is with heavy heart I share that my wonderful brother, Robert, peacefully passed away tonight,`` Donald Trump said in a statement. ``He was not just my brother, he was my best friend. He will be greatly missed, but we will meet again. His memory will live on in my heart forever. Robert, I love you. Rest in peace.''

The youngest of the Trump siblings remained close to the 74-year-old president and, as recently as June, filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Trump family that unsuccessfully sought to stop publication of a tell-all book by the president's niece, Mary.

Robert Trump had reportedly been hospitalized in the intensive care unit for several days that same month .

Both longtime businessmen, Robert and Donald had strikingly different personalities. Donald Trump once described his younger brother as ``much quieter and easygoing than I am,'' and ``the only guy in my life whom I ever call `honey.'''

Robert Trump began his career on Wall Street working in corporate finance but later joined the family business, managing real estate holdings as a top executive in the Trump Organization.

``When he worked in the Trump Organization, he was known as the nice Trump,`` Gwenda Blair, a Trump family biographer, told The Associated Press. ``Robert was the one people would try to get to intervene if there was a problem.''

Robert Stewart Trump was born in 1948, the youngest of New York City real estate developer Fred Trump's five children.

The president, two years older than Robert, admittedly bullied his brother in their younger years, even as he praised his loyalty and laid-back demeanor.

``I think it must be hard to have me for a brother but he's never said anything about it and we're very close,`` Donald Trump wrote in his 1987 bestseller ``The Art of the Deal.'' ``Robert gets along with almost everyone,`` he added, ``which is great for me since I sometimes have to be the bad guy.''

In the 1980s, Donald Trump tapped Robert Trump to oversee an Atlantic City casino project, calling him the perfect fit for the job. When it cannibalized his other casinos, though, ``he pointed the finger of blame at Robert,'' said Blair, author of ``The Trumps: Three Generations that Built an Empire.``

``When the slot machines jammed the opening weekend at the Taj Mahal, he very specifically and furiously denounced Robert, and Robert walked out and never worked for his brother again,'' Blair said.

A Boston University graduate, Robert Trump later managed the Brooklyn portion of father Fred Trump's real estate empire, which was eventually sold.

Once a regular boldface name in Manhattan's social pages, Robert Trump had kept a lower profile in recent years. ``He was not a newsmaker,'' Blair said.

Before divorcing his first wife, Blaine Trump, more than a decade ago, Robert Trump had been active on Manhattan's Upper East Side charity circuit.

He avoided the limelight during his elder brother's presidency, having retired to the Hudson Valley. But he described himself as a big supporter of the White House run in a 2016 interview with the New York Post.

``I support Donald one thousand percent,'' Robert Trump said.

In early March of 2020, he married his longtime girlfriend, Ann Marie Pallan.

The eldest Trump sibling and Mary's father, Fred Trump Jr., struggled with alcoholism and died in 1981 at the age of 43. The president's surviving siblings include Elizabeth Trump Grau and Maryanne Trump Barry, a retired federal appeals judge.

Authors Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher described Robert Trump as soft spoken but cerebral in ``Trump Revealed: The Definitive Biography of the 45th President'': ``He lacked Donald's charismatic showmanship, and he was happy to leave the bravado to his brother, but he could show flashes of Trump temper.``

NEW DELHI: Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) on Saturday created Mushirul Hasan Endowment (MHE) as a mark of respect to its former vice-chancellor, the late Mushirul Hasan, on his birth anniversary.

Hasan's wife, professor Zoya Hasan, proposed to donate Rs 1.5 crore to the university for its creation. Mushirul Hasan taught history at Jamia before eventually becoming its VC.

The endowment will be used for annual Mushirul Hasan post-doctoral fellowship - which will be for two semesters or nine months and open to candidates below 45 years, who have completed their PhDs from any Indian university, in all fields of humanities and social science. Candidates will have to submit their project proposals to Jamia, which will make the final choice. To start with, the fellowship will carry a stipend of Rs 50, 000 per month.

For administering the endowment, a nine-member committee headed by vice-chancellor of Jamia Najma Akhtar has also been constituted by the university.

334,['16/08/2020'],Gyms take a cautious approach as they open,"With the country slowly unlocking in phases, gyms in Goa received the permit to resume operations from August 5. However, only a handful have opened, while the rest wait and watch! The SOPs they have to follow include social distancing, mandatory use of face covers, frequent sanitisation and hand washes, installation and usage of Arogya Setu app and so on.Gyms have also received a detailed redesigning plan for placement of equipment to ensure safety. Gyms have started moving cardio and strength machines to create a distance, or are encouraging use of only alternate machines. Norbert D’souza from Norbert’s Fitness Studio says, “We have opened all 10 outlets except the Dona Paula branch. Since our cardio machines are close to each other, we are using alternate machines. We are sanitising all equipment after every use. All of our trainers are wearing gloves and face masks. There is no stretching or yoga, reduced personalised training, for safety reasons. We are instructing verbally. We’ve put out posters educating the clients. Everyone is supposed to wear a mask. We are logging in entries and body temperatures on entry. There’s frequent sanitisation,” says Norbert.Gyms are being disinfected, with emphasis on frequently used equipment, door knobs and so on. Members are encouraged to frequently sanitise their hands. Agnelo Fernandes from Body Tech Fitness says he has opened two of his branches in South Goa on August 6. “We disinfect when we start at 6am. We have instructed our members to wear pharmacy gloves, and then gym gloves, for safety. We have kept sanitisers and disinfectants at different spots and encourage people to sanitise their equipment once they’re done using it as part of personal hygiene. We have kept batch slots and people need to follow timings, to avoid crowding and have sufficient time for cleaning. Then there’s temperature checks, and we note down temperatures with name and time. We encourage clients to not walk around without shoes,” he says.Though gyms have reopened after five months, members are still worried and uncomfortable heading to the gym. “When gyms were shut, people were very excited to come back. But now, a lot of members are uncomfortable working out,” says Agnelo. However, Norbert adds, “We have to see how we can manage social distancing and following all safety precautions, before getting in a huge crowd.”Several gyms, including many in Panaji like Basilio’s and Fitness Bar, still remain shut. Adhvay from Basilio’s tells us, “It’s risky to open the gym when cases in Panaji are increasing rapidly. We will take a decision by the end of the month whether to open soon. People who work out may have good immunity, so may be safe, but they could put their families in danger.”Felipe Alvares from Fitness Bar is of the same opinion. He says, “We have sanitised the whole place and will open once the situation gets better. Model Prathamesh Maulingkar, who runs a gym in Thivim, says, “It’s too risky to open right now. Also, my gym is above my house, so I wouldn’t want to take the chance. I may consider opening next month or later.”",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77569530,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-3762129/77569530.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/fitness/gyms-take-a-cautious-approach-as-they-open/articleshow/77569517.cms

COIMBATORE: The CB-CID has formed a team to nab a Sri Lankan national, who is in possession of a pistol which belonged to deceased Sri Lankan underworld don Maddumage Lasantha Chandana Perera alias Angoda Lokka . Lokka had the pistol with him when he was hiding in Coimbatore, police sources said.

Lokka was hiding in a rented house at Green Garden at Cheran Maa Nagar here with Dhanji. He had obtained an Aadhaar card in the name of Pradeep Singh, with the help of Sundari and her friend Dhyaneswaran.

The CB-CID, who produced the trio before the CJM court on Saturday, sought 10 days custody. They have also booked them under the Arms Act, 1959 and the Foreigners Act, 1946. Meanwhile, Sundari has filed a petition before the CJM court, seeking conditional bail. It will come up for hearing on Wednesday.

337,['16/08/2020'],"Lawyers turn vegetable vendors, delivery boys to make up for lost income","Photo used for representational purpose only

MUMBAI: As Aditya Kashyap sits by his vegetable cart in a bylane of Vasai, he tries not to think about five months ago when he was busy filing bail pleas and snapping up clients in magistrate courts .

The Advocates Act does not permit lawyers to take up any other occupation. But with courts functioning partially and no income during the lockdown, Kashyap has been forced to start selling vegetables to feed his family of six.

Like Kashyap, many independent lawyers have taken up other jobs to stave off starvation.

Some are driving autos while others have turned into delivery boys.

Individual lawyers practising in mofussil courts or district courts constitute more than 95% per cent of the total lawyer population (about 12 lakh) in the country,"" said Lalit Bhasin, president of the Bar Association of India.

After the lockdown was announced, the judiciary decided they would only attend to urgent matters and through video conferencing. Unlike senior counsels who charge large sums for hearings, a majority of lawyers in the country, especially in lower courts, function on a case-to-case basis for income. Kashyap, for instance, did miscellaneous work in magistrate courts-- filing applications for return of property, bail pleas or cancellation of warrants.

""Saara cash par kaam hota tha, (it used to be cash based work),"" said Kashyap, adding that sometimes he made Rs 1,000 in just half an hour. But the police haven't been making too many arrests in the lockdown which has translated into lesser remand applications in court. ""For the first two months, my family and I survived on savings. Then, we began to borrow from friends and eventually, I sold off my wife's ornaments. There's still the house rent to pay, school fees for my children besides household expenses. The vegetable cart doesn't bring in much money but helps put food on the table,"" he said.

A junior lawyer, who handled drafting work for a senior, said he couldn't travel to courts after local trains stopped operations. He now works as a deliveryman with an ecommerce company. ""Banks are not keen on offering loans to lawyers. The Bar Council of Gujarat has allowed lawyers to take up jobs or conduct business other than their legal practice to augment their income during the lockdown. But the Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa (BCMG) requires us to surrender our sanad (licence to practice) if we wish to take up another occupation,"" he said. TOI contacted the BCMG to inquire whether any lawyers had surrendered sanad to pursue other occupations and found that none had. One of the reasons could be that re-enrolment for sanad is a time-consuming process.

A female lawyer, who used to handle cheque bouncing cases and mutual consent divorce cases, is now a customer care rep with a private company. ""Most cases were simply being adjourned, leaving no scope for any real chargeable work. Anxiety started setting in with no work and so, I decided to take up a job. It pays me around Rs 25,000, nowhere close to the Rs 1 lakh per month I used to make but it keeps me engaged,” she told TOI.

Those who were doing relatively well before the lockdown are also considering looking for other jobs now. A lawyer from Dadar who had been getting steady independent work said he has only got two new matters during the lockdown. ""My parents too are lawyers but they are elderly and homebound. Currently, we are dipping into our savings but if courts don't function fully, I will have to find a full time job in any sector where there are vacancies,"" he said.

On two occasions during lockdown, the BCMG gave out ration kits to lawyers that had fallen on bad times. In April and in May, lawyers who were doing slightly better were tasked with the job of reaching out to their colleagues in distress with the ration kits. ""Each kit lasted us a fortnight,"" said Kashyap.

Resuming full day courts is perhaps a solution, some lawyers believe. Others say that prevailing circumstances have highlighted the need for courts and lawyers to be technologically equipped and move online. “Some have taken up the challenge head-on and utilised their time and resources to cater to what the situation demands. But many continue to struggle due to lack of access,” said a lawyer.

Lower courts need to upgrade and also ensure optimum utilisation of existing equipment. ""We need better internet connectivity and jails too need to be equipped with additional infrastructure to enable more proceedings to be conducted virtually,” another lawyer added.

(Kashyap's name has been changed to protect identity)

340,['16/08/2020'],BMRCL to set up tree park at Bellahalli dumping site,"Development work at Veerasandra Lake has been completed, said BMRCL. Land issues delayed the project.

BENGALURU: Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation plans to build a 25-acre tree park at Bellahalli dumping site. As part of its afforestation drive, it wants to plant 3,000-4,000 saplings on the landfill. “The restoration work involves providing a tree park in the BBMP-identified area of about 25 acres,” said BL Yashwanth Chavan, chief public relations officer, BMRCL.

“About 25 species have been recommended by Institute of Wood Science and Technology and Environmental Management & Policy Research Institute,” added Chavan.

“Since it’s a quarry, BBMP plans to begin leachate treatment and gas extraction in the identified area and also study their impact on the proposed plantation. We are waiting for the civic body’s reply for final planning,” he said.

He said BBMP has stopped dumping in the area identified for the tree park. “We will also do earth filling (for four feet) before the restoration work,” said Chavan.

Veerasandra Lake to be ready by March 2021

BMRCL had earlier planned to develop Kengeri and Veerasandra lakes. While in February 2018 it signed an MoU with Titan Company Limited to develop 17 acres of Veerasandra Lake in Electronics City, there are no takers for Kengeri Lake.

Titan has its corporate office in Veerasandra and is taking up the lake rejuvenation through its CSR funds. The restoration work, at an estimated cost of Rs 8 crore, was supposed to be completed by February 2020. “All works inside the lake area have been completed. Miscellaneous works such as gardening, lighting, paver blocks for jogging track are on. The delay was due to land issues in the lake area,” said Chavan.

BMRCL selected these lakes due to their proximity to proposed Metro stations. While Kengeri Lake is located near the proposed Mailasandra station on Mysuru Road, Veerasandra Lake is in the vicinity of Huskur Road station in Electronics City.

BMRCL has also taken up mass plantation drives at lakes at Rachenahalli , Horamavu Agara, Avalahalli and Jakkur in coordination with BBMP. “We are planting around 10,000 saplings,” said an official.

346,['16/08/2020'],Maharashtra must revoke confusing property registration circular,"Photo used for representational purpose only

MUMBAI: The state revenue department has issued a circular to all registrars that they “may not insist” on a no objection certificate from Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRERA) to register property documents .

Experts said the circular issued on Friday is so poorly drafted that it will not resolve a problem created by the revenue department in November last year and will continue to cost the state government precious revenue.

Nitin Kareer, additional chief secretary, revenue, said in November last a circular was issued by the inspector general of registration that no property documents are to be registered unless the project is registered with MahaRERA.

“Subsequently, MahaRERA issued a clarification that not all projects need to be registered with the authority. Building projects, which are on plots less than 500 square metres with only eight apartments, are exempted under MahaRERA and do not need to be registered with it. Hence, we have now issued a fresh circular that registrars may not insist on a MahaRERA registration for documents,” he said. In Mumbai, 90% of the plots are less than 500 sq m in size and so would be exempt from MahaRERA registration, said experts.

Advocate Godfrey Pimenta said the circular that the revenue department has issued states all those projects granted exemption by MahaRERA also get it under Rule 44 of the Maharashtra Registration Rules, 1961.

“Rule 44 merely prescribes the requirements to be verified before accepting the document for registration. It is improper on the part of the state government to exempt documents from being registered, since the Registration Act, 1908, mandates that documents pertaining to property whose value is above Rs 100 are to be compulsorily registered. The registration fee is currently 1% of the property value with a ceiling of Rs 30,000. The circular is very badly worded and must be withdrawn.”

Satyan Prasad, techno-legal consultant to the real estate industry, said it is a registrar’s duty to accept any document brought for registration. “The circular states the registrar may not insist on an NOC but what if the registrar does insist on proof to show the project is exempted from registration with MahaRERA. It only causes harassment to the developer and buyer,” he said.

Prasad further said the government can ask MahaRERA to issue an exemption certificate just like it does a registration certificate. “This will help the developer who can put it up at his project site to show the project is not dubious. It will help the buyer make an informed decision and not be harassed by the registrar’s office and ensure the government earns revenue,” he said, adding the Bombay high court has, in a judgement, stated Rule 44 can be invoked only if a sale transaction is prohibited by law. “Both circulars must be withdrawn immediately.”

BENGALURU: The New Education Policy has good ideas. “The goal of NEP is to ‘make India a vibrant knowledge hub,’ I quote, and it has good ideas like attracting world-class universities and adopting their model of education,” Nobel laureate Prof Abhijit Banerjee said on Saturday, adding that the country must also have faith in its knowledge and intellectual base.

Banerjee made the remarks during the opening session of The/Nudge Forum ( global edition ) on “India’s fight against poverty: Seminal moments in our development journey, current challenges and opportunities to effect inclusive and sustainable growth”.

The/Nudge Forum, in partnership with Rockefeller Foundation and Skoll Foundation, has organised the 24-hour global virtual event which began at 12am. Speaking on the education policy in a panel discussion later, K Kasturirangan , chairperson of the committee on NEP, said it had taken into consideration India’s multi-lingual, multi-cultural and plural structure. “We can’t cut short the process of thinking,” Kasturirangan said in his conversation with TV Mohandas Pai , chairman, Manipal Global Education & 3one4 Capital.

As part of their panel’s theme — “New Education Policy and the vision of no child left behind” — Pai lauded the policy for being a result of a large democratic process. “How does the policy ensure no child will be left behind and can have equal access to education?” Pai asked.

Kasturirangan explained: “The policy envisions a child to play a meaningful role in society. They should be employable, have basic ideas of issues, subscribe to the basic ethos of our country, should be able to understand things, have sound judgement, be creative and understand the world.”

LISBON: Moussa Dembele came off the bench to score two late goals as Lyon caused another Champions League sensation on Saturday, dumping out Pep Guardiola's Manchester City with a 3-1 quarter-final win in Lisbon .City had looked on course to come back and win the tie behind closed doors at the Estadio Jose Alvalade after Kevin De Bruyne's goal midway through the second half had cancelled out Maxwel Cornet's first-half opener.However, Dembele put Lyon back ahead in the 79th minute and then capitalised on a shocking miss by Raheem Sterling to clinch the victory three minutes from the end.Against all expectations, a team who finished seventh in the curtailed French season, and had played just two competitive games since early March, now find themselves through to a Champions League semi-final on Wednesday against Bayern Munich.That, surely, will be a step too far for Rudi Garcia's team but then again nobody expected them to eliminate Juventus in the last round, never mind knock out City here.Guardiola's team had been warned about Lyon, losing at home and then drawing away against the French club in last season's Champions League.But that was almost two years ago now and Lyon had lost several key players since then.This, a day after Bayern's 8-2 demolition of Barcelona, is a seismic shock and a hammer blow to the ambitions of City under Guardiola.Their wait for European glory will go on, with this a third consecutive exit in the quarter-finals.Guardiola was brought to the Etihad Stadium to deliver the Champions League, but he has not managed to equal the club's best performance to date in the competition, a semi-final appearance in 2016, just before he was appointed.And so, a year after Liverpool beat Tottenham Hotspur in an all-English final, there will be no English representative in the semi-finals in the Portuguese capital.Instead both ties will be Franco-German duels, with Paris Saint-Germain facing RB Leipzig before Bayern meet Lyon in a repeat of the 2010 semi-finals.Guardiola had set his team up with a three-man defence, as Fernandinho and Aymeric Laporte were joined by the young Spaniard Eric Garcia in the back line. Phil Foden dropped out of their line-up.City created little in the first half and were caught out by a long ball over the top as Lyon took the lead.Garcia raced back to tackle Karl Toko-Ekambi but Cornet was quickest to the loose ball and, with Ederson off his line, curled a low shot first-time into the corner of the net to keep up his remarkable record against these opponents -- the wing-back scored three times against them in last season's two meetings.De Bruyne appeared the most likely to make something happen for City and threatened from free-kicks after the restart, as City turned up the heat following the introduction of Riyad Mahrez in place of Fernandinho.The equaliser duly arrived in the 69th minute as Mahrez clipped a ball forward towards Sterling and he cut it back from the byline to De Bruyne, the Belgian arriving unmarked at the edge of the box to sidefoot home first-time.Few would have bet against City going on to win the game from there. Lyon had offered nothing going forward in the second half and coach Garcia even decided to take off Memphis Depay, who had been anonymous.But it proved an inspired decision as his replacement Dembele latched onto Houssem Aouar's through ball to race through on goal and beat Ederson.City expected the effort to be disallowed following a VAR review but the Dutch officials let it stand, and Lyon were back in front.Still they should have been pegged back again, but Sterling somehow put the ball over with the goal gaping having been teed up by Ilkay Gundogan.Lyon went straight downfield and sealed a famous victory as Dembele converted the loose ball after Ederson had saved from Aouar.",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77569664,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-95354,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/football/champions-league/lyon-stun-manchester-city-to-reach-champions-league-semifinals/articleshow/77569640.cms

351,['16/08/2020'],The missing link between philosophy and result,"Bayern Munich's Philippe Coutinho celebrates after scoring his side's eighth goal against FC Barcelona. (AP Ph... Read More

There's a scene in Gangs of Wasseypur , where legislator JP Singh, sitting in the Police Superintendent's office to resolve a land grabbing case, arrogantly reminds upstart goons, Sardar Khan and Asgar, of his position and their place. We all know how that goes down. JP is slapped around as if for fun, and amidst all the derision, an altered balance of power is announced with quiet intent and menace.

Arturo Vidal, Barcelona's mohawked battering ram, had his JP moment the other day. Ahead of his team's run-in with his erstwhile employers, Bayern Munich, the Chilean would remind them, ""You are playing against Barca and Barca is the best team in the world"". Vidal's words were not so much as a come-get-us dare but a staggering delusion about one's own standing. We all know how that went down.

Barcelona haven't even been the best team in their own backyard for a while now. They just needed to step out of the confines of the Nou Camp to discover how average they had become - from aesthetes of a thousand dazzling passes to strange strugglers who couldn't get foot on ball against Bayern. Push Messi and goalkeeper Ter Stegen out of the equation, if that's even a possibility, and you'd have a very ordinary team before you, far, far removed from that lofty idea that could once combine result and philosophy for such footballing efficiency.

For 15 years, constantly refining it as they went, Barcelona had defined the standard for others to emulate. They marked a strange constant in the flux of modern-day sport as if the union of their ideas was nothing. Today, they've run into a riddle of their own making which they can't find their way out of. In the last few seasons, teams forgot to fear them - Roma, Liverpool and Bayern -- and when that happens, you know it is the beginning of the end.

The decline of Barcelona was imminent. An era was ending, but when did the end start?. Was it the departure of Xavi, Iniesta and Puyol and the moral compass they brought to the ideal? Or was it the club's inability to replace them with adequate talent from their stable, or signings from elsewhere? The whimsical departure of Neymar and his constant comings and goings, or the hasty axe of the workman-like Ernesto Valverde? Maybe perhaps their bloated salary budget - the highest in world sport currently - or a myopic board's ill-advised outings in the transfer market? Was it Iago Aspas' freekick for Celta Vigo in a post-Covid world that actually set the balling rolling or did Setien's refusal to play three strikers - either the seasoned Griezmann or the prodigious Fati - in the final match to salvage the season capsized them?

Either way, did it need the intent and menace of Bayern to finally end it, in what they called was, ""rock bottom"" this time? Probably.

A failing institution often gets overrun in similar fashion by the machine-like efficiency of a team at the peak of its powers. The beauty and music of a highly performing outfit can be a sight to behold, and Barcelona could only look on wistfully, perhaps even with a sense of nostalgia of their prime, as they were cut to ribbons. Bayern's slick rampage bore eerie shades of the 7-1 verdict Germany handed to Brazil in the semi-final of the 2014 World Cup. Both had the irrepressible Thomas Mueller at the centre of things. Here somewhat born-again, Mueller's revival stood in stark contrast to the rapid disappearance of Sergio Busquets and with him, as the fulcrum of the team's structure, his team itself

It is hard to feel remorse at the manner of Barcelona's capitulation. They had been calling it upon themselves. Or did everyone at Barcelona - the squad, an inept manager and the board - believe, however foolishly, that Messi would keep bailing them out?

Is it also possible that Messi himself and his massive genius could be the deterrent in Barcelona's need to fashion change and transformation? With the exception of Luis Suarez, and briefly, Neymar, stars have come and left but failed to forge a working relationship in the system that Messi and Barcelona operate. Maybe, the system itself, forged out of the structure and teachings of La Masia, itself has run its time. As ideas ran out, and rivals got their measure, there always seemed a rigidity to their ways, a lack of a workable alternate when the lofty original one failed to work. It is possible that in being faithful to their philosophy, Barcelona failed to hold on to the idea of - and desire for - result. In teaching the world the game, Barcelona themselves forgot to evolve.

WASHINGTON: Democratic vice-presidential nominee Senator Kamala Harris , during her maiden address to the Indian-American community, reflected on her proud Indian heritage and recalled how her mother always wanted to instill in her a ""love for good idli"".

Harris, 55, who is the first black to be selected as a vice-presidential candidate of a major party, took a trip down the memory lane, mentioning her ""long walks"" in Madras (now Chennai) with her grandfather who would tell her about the ""heroes"" responsible for the birth of the world's largest democracy.

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden , 77, scripted history by selecting Harris , an Indian-American and an African-American, as his running mate in the presidential election on November 3.

Born to a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, California senator Harris, if elected, would be second in line of succession after Biden.

""Today on August 15, 2020. I stand before you as the first candidate for vice president of the United States of South Asian descent,"" Harris said in her address organised by Indians for Biden National Council.

Joined by Biden, she greeted Indian Americans on the occasion of India's Independence Day.

""To the people of India and to Indian Americans all across the US, I want to wish you a happy Indian Independence Day. On August 15, 1947, men and women all over India rejoiced in the declaration of the independence of the country of India,"" Harris said during the virtual inaugural meet of the council.

Harris was born on October 20 in 1964, at Oakland in California. Her mother Shyamala Gopalan migrated to the US from Tamil Nadu in India, while her father, Donald J Harris, moved to the US from Jamaica.

""When my mother, Shyamala stepped off the plane in California as 19 years old, she didn't have much in the way of belongings. But she carried with her lessons from back home, including ones she learned from her parents, my grandmother Rajan, and her father, my grandfather P V Gopalan. They taught her that when you see injustice in the world, you have an obligation to do something about it,"" Harris said.

""Which is what inspired my mother to march and shout on the streets of Oakland, at the height of the civil rights movement, a movement where leaders including Dr Martin Luther King Jr, were themselves inspired by the non-violent activism of Mahatma Gandhi,"" she said.

Harris said it was during those protests that her mother met her father. The rest, as they say, is history, she said.

""Growing up, my mother would take my sister Maya and me back to what was then called Madras because she wanted us to understand where she had come from and where we had ancestry. And of course, she always wanted to instill in us, a love of good idli,"" Harris said.

""In Madras I would go on long walks with my grandfather, who at that point was retired. We would take morning walks where I'd hold his hand and he would tell me about the heroes who are responsible for the birth of the world's biggest democracy. He would explain that it's on us to pick up where they left off. Those lessons are a big reason why I am who I am today,” Harris said explaining the deep influence of the Indian heritage on her.

""Our community is bound together by so much more than our shared history and culture,"" she said.

The reason there is a kinship between everyone who are a product of the South Asian diaspora, no matter how diverse our backgrounds may be, ""is because we also share a set of values: values forged by overcoming colonial past, not only in one nation but in two”, Harris said.

""Values like tolerance pluralism, and diversity and reflecting on the past 73 years it's remarkable how much progress, people have made in the fight for justice. And should be proud. But we wouldn't be if we didn't commit ourselves to building an even better future. So, I hope you celebrate today, and then tomorrow, I hope you join me in getting to work,” she said.

353,['16/08/2020'],Mumbai News: Sales at Crawford Market crash to 20% of pre-Covid days,"TimesView It is imperative that the state government and BMC consciously work to restore the confidence of traders in the commercial capital, and especially of very small traders at markets such as Crawford Market which are beneficial to both buyer and seller in terms of affordability. One way to do that would be increase accessibility and approach, particularly by facilitating inter-district travel since markets like these have wholesalers who also supply stuff beyond Mumbai.

MUMBAI: Two months after the iconic Crawford Market reopened, the once-ubiquitous coolies and hand-cart pullers who used to rush along its narrow lanes laden with wares, are down to a fraction of their strength. The few who are there are struggling to get by.“I used to make Rs 500-700 a day. Now with barely any goods or customers, I made Rs 100 today,” says Suresh Ram who carries a cane basket on his head. The goods carriers are a barometer of the market’s trade, which is still just around 20% of pre-Covid days. This cuts across the wholesale bazaars for steel, cloth, toys, crockery, paper and luggage. “We are still selling old stock we had before lockdown. Sales are just 15-20% of what we managed earlier,” says Hamza Taiban of HNS Plastics in Lohar Chawl.Sales improved from this month since shops can now open daily instead of alternate days. But lack of transport links is the spoke in the wheel. “Without local trains, only customers we get are those who live close by and can either walk or travel by road. Crawford Market is a major supplier of wholesale goods to different states. Those sales are also at a standstill,” says Taiban.With incomes dipping through the lockdown, purchasing power is also low. “People have lost jobs or had pay cuts. They will only buy food and highly necessary items. Curtains and bedsheets are not a priority,” says Sunil Pawar, manager of A to Z Furnishings which had a daily turnover of Rs 1.5 lakh is now making just about Rs 25,000.Shopkeepers say they have already missed out on big festival seasons of Eid and Rakshabandhan when sales peak. “Diwali is the next big hope. I hope things improve by then. Ganeshotsav purchases are limited to decorative items,” says Arif Shaikh of National Toys.What’s worrying many are the astronomical rents which touch Rs 1 lakh a month even for relatively small shops. The East Coast Stationery shop, which supplies school equipment, is managing just about 10% sales with schools shut. Yet, proprietor Dhiren Shah says he is facing a rent of Rs 3 lakh a month. “Who is buying school bags and lunch boxes nowadays? We have no idea when schools will open. It is a difficult situation,” says Shah.The continuing slump has had a cascading effect on jobs at Crawford Market which employs hundreds of locals and migrants. Most shop owners admit they could not afford to pay staff during lockdown. And they also say they cannot employ the numbers they once did.“We had a staff of 60 people. Now we have only six. In any case, we cannot keep more than 10% staff in the shop,” says Pawar of A to Z furnishings. Mushtaq Ahmed from N H Traders says he sent four of his six workers to their home in Bihar at the start of the lockdown. “I could not afford to keep them or pay them as the shop was shut. Now they keep calling, asking me to take them back. But if sales don’t pick up, I do not need them, nor can I pay them,” says Ahmed.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77569705,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1238487,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sales-at-crawford-market-crash-to-20-of-pre-covid-days/articleshow/77569707.cms

356,['16/08/2020'],Bengaluru violence: Cops rule out hack; Naveen blames pals,"Seventy-five more people have been detained for questioning over the August 11 violence in DJ Halli.

BENGALURU: The derogatory Facebook post that sparked tensions in DJ Halli on Tuesday was sent from the mobile phone of P Naveen, the nephew of Pulakeshinagar MLA Akhanda Srinivasamurthy , and no one had hacked his account, police ascertained on Saturday. But Naveen claims that a friend or an acquaintance who visited his house that day might have accessed his phone and account, said an investigating officer.

Naveen, who is in police custody, had earlier alleged that his Facebook account was hacked. Cyber forensic inquiries have ruled it out, confirming that the post was fired from his phone around 5pm Tuesday. “After this came to light, Naveen said he had several visitors that day and he left the phone unattended somewhere in the house. It was not password protected apparently,” the officer said. “He maintains he did not share the objectionable post, and has provided a list of visitors.”

After recording a statement (not the final account of events), police took Naveen to his home to recreate the scene on Saturday. “Right now, we only have a statement. His claim needs to be probed,” said an officer. Naveen spoke to his uncle’s staff on Tuesday evening. “We have found that people in the MLA’s team made multiple calls to Naveen when the MLA’s house was being attacked,” the officer said.

Seventy-five more people have been detained for questioning. They are suspected to have mobilised a crowd and shared false or misleading messages. “Some messages made false claims of police brutality,” the officer said.

Since Tuesday, over 200 people have been arrested over the riots. The 75 people being quizzed are not among them.

Yes, there are some guidelines to follow while opting for the right kind of necklace that complements the neckline of your attire to bring out the best of your neckpiece. Indian or western, we've got the ultimate necklace guide for you. It will help you to understand which necklace will suit your outfit's neckline.People go wrong in styling the standard round neck more often than you would expect. Depending upon the depth of the neckline, there is scope for a variety of options that fit in well. Crew necks look good with long layered necklaces or long chains with pendant. A little deeper round neck opens the doors for shorter chains with pendants or bib necklaces alike. For a heavier look, one can also pair this with a choker ad matching layered long necklace.The sole principle to follow while accessorizing a necklace with a V neckline is to ensure that the chosen piece flatters your outfit. Choose a smaller neckpiece for a narrow plunge and larger ones for wider necklines. You can either choose a V shaped short necklace, or multiple round necklaces. Even lariat necklaces go well with this neckline. One can choose a plain simple necklace, which can come with a simple and slim pendant.Chokers complement turtlenecks very well. One can also make a statement with multi-chain necklaces of varied lengths and different pendants. You can mix and match to balance out the look.A sweetheart neck is one of the most feminine and pretty necklines, which can be beautifully merged with a thinner bib style neckpiece. One can also wear pendant necklaces with drops.If you choose to wear the classic Boat neck, accompany it with a typical high horizontal neckline or long, multiple necklace. You can also sync it with beady necklace that would hang much lower than the neckline.To add in a bit of twist for your formal occasion, you can also play with choker necklace and with long pendant neckpieces.Inputs by Milind Mathur, Creative Director and Partner, Kohinoor Jewellers Agra",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77562788,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1370849/77562788.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/fashion/luxury/featured/how-to-choose-the-perfect-necklace-for-your-neckline/articleshow/77562652.cms

361,['16/08/2020'],Bengaluru violence: Why SDPI is a worry for Congress in Karnataka,"Risk of vote split?

BENGALURU: Every time there’s communal trouble in Karnataka , BJP and Congress clamour for a ban on Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), the political wing of controversial organisation Popular Front of India. While BJP is more vocal about it, Congress perhaps attaches greater importance to the demand. This is because a more popular SDPI threatens to erode Congress’s reach among Muslims, who form 13 per cent of the state’s population and are a key support base of the party.There are concerns among some Congress members that the party might stop being Muslims’ sole political voice.In the 2013 assembly polls, SDPI contested 23 seats, but lost badly in 22, managing a cumulative vote share of 3.2 per cent. The seats were primarily in areas with a sizeable Muslim population. In the 2018 assembly elections, SDPI fielded candidates in 25 constituencies, out of which it finally contested in only three — Narasimharaja in Mysuru, Chickpet in Bengaluru and Kalaburagi North. It withdrew from the 22 segments because of reported pressure from community leaders and Congress members.In the past two years, SDPI, formed in 2009, has gained more supporters by contesting rural and urban local bodies’ polls. According to its Karnataka media incharge, Abrar Ahmed, it has 65 elected representatives in gram panchayats and 24 in urban local bodies, mainly in Dakshina Kannada, Kodagu, Chamarajnagar, Kolar , Yadgir and Bengaluru Urban and Rural districts. SDPI’’s Mujahid Pasha was elected from Siddapura ward in Chickpet in the last BBMP polls. The group plans to strengthen its political activities.“Congress is not doing enough for the community’s cause. It doesn’t give the community adequate representation in the assembly or Lok Sabha elections.

362,['16/08/2020'],Bengaluru violence: Why SDPI is a worry for Congress in Karnataka,"Risk of vote split?

BENGALURU: Every time there’s communal trouble in Karnataka , BJP and Congress clamour for a ban on Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), the political wing of controversial organisation Popular Front of India. While BJP is more vocal about it, Congress perhaps attaches greater importance to the demand. This is because a more popular SDPI threatens to erode Congress’s reach among Muslims, who form 13 per cent of the state’s population and are a key support base of the party.There are concerns among some Congress members that the party might stop being Muslims’ sole political voice.In the 2013 assembly polls, SDPI contested 23 seats, but lost badly in 22, managing a cumulative vote share of 3.2 per cent. The seats were primarily in areas with a sizeable Muslim population. In the 2018 assembly elections, SDPI fielded candidates in 25 constituencies, out of which it finally contested in only three — Narasimharaja in Mysuru, Chickpet in Bengaluru and Kalaburagi North. It withdrew from the 22 segments because of reported pressure from community leaders and Congress members.In the past two years, SDPI, formed in 2009, has gained more supporters by contesting rural and urban local bodies’ polls. According to its Karnataka media incharge, Abrar Ahmed, it has 65 elected representatives in gram panchayats and 24 in urban local bodies, mainly in Dakshina Kannada, Kodagu, Chamarajnagar, Kolar , Yadgir and Bengaluru Urban and Rural districts. SDPI’’s Mujahid Pasha was elected from Siddapura ward in Chickpet in the last BBMP polls. The group plans to strengthen its political activities.“Congress is not doing enough for the community’s cause. It doesn’t give the community adequate representation in the assembly or Lok Sabha elections. Therefore, we have taken on the mantle,” said an SDPI functionary.Senior Congress politicians dismiss the talk of SDPI hurting the party. But some others say SDPI’s popularity will split the Muslim vote, which will benefit BJP.

CHENNAI: Magnus Carlsen had to use all his experience to overcome Hikaru Nakamura on Saturday and wrestle himself back into the final of his signature tournament.

The two fierce rivals played out a thrilling but at times a bizarre second day in the $140,000 Magnus Carlsen Chess Tour Final which the World Champion won to leave the match score at 1-1. Nakamura, who dominated on Friday, had looked in ominous form as he rode to victory in the first game, a razor-sharp encounter that had fans on the edge of their seats.

A super-quick 14-move draw then followed as Carlsen wanted to stabilise and Nakamura was perfectly content to sit on his lead. In game 3, Nakamura and Carlsen resumed hostilities with the American again looking strong. But a small lapse from Nakamura left a door open for Carlsen to roar back.

The mistake cost the American dearly as Carlsen busted through to get the win he desperately needed to level the set 1.5-1.5. Then game 4 was an exact repeat of game 2 - a quick 14-move so-called ""Grandmaster draw"" that followed the precise moves and ended with a draw by repetition agreed between the players.

Carlsen laughed on screen as it ended as both players were obviously content to back their skills in two speed up games and push the set into a blitz chess tiebreaker. ""I thought it was just funny that we played the second game twice,"" said Carlsen afterward.

But in the commentary box four-time US champ Yasser Seirawan , a respected voice on the game, called it ""cynical"" and said it ""leaves a bad taste"".

Grandmaster Peter Leko added that rightly or wrongly in online chess the two quickly drawn games only served to ramp up the tension even more as Carlsen and Nakamura headed into the play-off. The first blitz game ended in another draw - this time keenly-fought. But in the second, pressure finally got to Nakamura and the challenger cracked. At last, there was something to separate the two and Carlsen had won the set.

When asked about Nakamura's mistake, Carlsen said: ""Yeah, that was a pleasant feeling!"" Carlsen and Nakamura are now tied 1-1 in the best-of-seven final.

NEW DELHI: The crestfallen look on Mahendra Singh Dhoni 's face was beamed across the subcontinent as the then 23-year-old -- his silky black mane cascading on his broad shoulders -- appeared gutted after a nightmarish international debut in 2004.Dhoni had fallen for a first ball duck in Chittagong, and in the cruellest of manner -- run out.For much of the next decade-and-a-half, Dhoni subjected rivals to such agonies -- from behind the stumps, with the bat, and as a shrewd captain of a highly successful team.Three and half months after that forgettable debut, Dhoni announced his arrival with a breath-taking 148 off 123 balls against Pakistan in Visakhapatnam.He wielded the willow like a mace and his batting was less technique and more pyrotechnic.He did not have the steely defence of a Rahul Dravid or the silken touch of a VVS Laxman but Dhoni made up with his muscular ingenuity.He converted the yorker into a scoring opportunity with his trademark 'helicopter shot', a culmination of violent convulsions involving his arm, wrists and torso.Dhoni wrote his own 'keeping manual too, barely moving hands sideways before gathering the ball and rather thrusting them down to pull off electric stumpings.His biggest legacy, however, would be as India's 'Captain Cool' who was also one of one-day cricket 's greatest finishers.Dhoni is the only captain to win all ICC trophies -- T20 World Cup in 2007, 50-overs World Cup in 2011 and Champions Trophy in 2013. Under him, India also became the top-ranked Test nation in 2009.And he led a cricket-mad nation of 1.3 billion with ice in his veins.""It's almost as if he doesn't have them; a performance-enhancing gift from birth,"" India's former mental conditioning coach Paddy Upton wrote about Dhoni 's control over emotion in his memoir.Dhoni's penchant for taking inspiring decisions was best illustrated in the tense final of the 2007 World Cup, when he famously asked an unheralded Joginder Sharma to bowl the final over in a tactical masterstroke against Pakistan.He also transformed himself into a formidable 'finisher', securing India's 2011 World Cup victory by hitting a six in the final against Sri Lanka.Age, however, appeared to catch up with him in the World Cup in England last year.He struggled to time the ball even against mediocre attacks and failed to provide the late assault that he once routinely delivered.Those wild, flowing tresses that was once a rage among the youths in rural India, have now been replaced by greying sideburns.An enigma throughout his career, Dhoni quit Test cricket in the middle of India's 2014 series in Australia.On Saturday, he again shocked an unsuspecting nation, announcing his exit from international cricket with a cryptic Instagram message.His fairytale rise from India's cricketing backwaters of Jharkhand sounds like a storyline straight out of a Bollywood script. In reality, it's the other way round.Known for his fondness for bikes and military fatigue, Dhoni's stellar career inspired a 2016 biopic ""M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story"" which was a roaring box office success.Such has been his influence that successor Virat Kohli still considers Dhoni his captain.""The world has seen achievements, I've seen the person. Thanks for everything skip. I tip my hat to you,"" Kohli said on Twitter on Saturday.",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77569788,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-165424,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/cricket/news/hinterland-to-centrestage-ms-dhoni-ends-journey-with-enigma-intact/articleshow/77569787.cms
365,['16/08/2020'],Rape Case in Lakhimpur Kheri: 13-year-old girl raped and murdered in Lakhimpur Kheri,"The incident occurred in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri district

BAREILLY: A 13-year-old Dalit girl was raped and murdered for defecating in a farmland in Pakaria village of Isanagar area in Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri district late on Friday.

The girl was missing after she had gone to relieve herself in the field. She was found dead in the cane field later.

Police dismissed reports that the girl had sustained grievous injuries on her tongue and eyes in the incident, and said the postmortem stated that the death was due to strangulation after rape.

The incident drew strong opposition condemnation, with Congress and SP leaders attacking the Adityanath government over the law and order situation in the state.

Police said the girl had gone to her fields on Friday afternoon. When she did not return home, her family started looking for her and found her body in a sugarcane field.

Two men were arrested on Friday night.

Police have registered an FIR against Sanjay Kumar and Santosh under IPC section 302 (murder) and SC/ST Act at Isanagar police station and both the accused were detained on Saturday. Later, section 376d (gang-rape) and POCSO were added to the FIR after autopsy confirmed the sexual assault.

SHO Isanagar told TOI, “The accused Sanjay had a tiff with the girl's family over defecating in his farmland in the past. The girl was found in his cane field and family had named him in their complaint. During interrogation, Sanjay has accepted to have killed the girl along with Santosh, who is also a Dalit. The eyes of the girl were not gouged out but there were visible injuries on her eyes caused by sharp sugarcane leaves"".

Lashing out at the state government over the law and order situation, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav said the incident has shaken humanity.

""The rape and murder of a teenage girl in Lakhimpur Kheri in UP is an incident, which has shaken humanity. In the BJP rule, atrocities on children and women are at an all-time high,"" he charged in a tweet in Hindi.

""Why is the BJP government shielding those who are involved in rape, kidnapping, murder and other crime,"" the former state chief minister asked.

Senior Congress leader Jitin Prasada on Sunday said, ""The inhuman act with a girl has put humanity to shame. This is an extremely saddening incident. In this episode, the police must initiate such a strong action that it becomes a deterrent for criminals.""

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

#CurlTalk : I get so many comments and messages asking me how I keep my curls frizz free. My hair is never a 100 percent frizz free. It’s very hard to get curly hair to look absolutely perfect and now that my hair is super long, there are a lot of dry and dead ends. But one tip that works for me, is to never touch my hair when it’s drying ❌ So after you finish styling your wet hair with creams and your preferred stylers, leave your hair alone!!!! 🤫 Do not touch it. Let it do it’s thing and be very gentle with it. You don’t wanna disturb it’s curl pattern when it’s drying. And after your hair is dry, you can add 2-3 drops of a light hair oil and fluff your hair *gently* to scrunch out that crunchy texture your stylers leave behind and you’re good to go 😘 Don’t worry if your hair still doesn’t behave. Dont give up on your hair! Curls are supposed to have a mind and personality of their own. If you take good care of them and show them some love, they might eventually want to start working with you 🤪 Hope this helps my curlfriends 💕 Let me know if you have any questions in the comments below 😘 #curlyhair #curlygirl #curlsfordays #curlyhairtips #curlyhaircare",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77566926,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-228286/77566926.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/telugu/movies/news/actress-ritika-singh-shares-her-secret-to-the-perfect-curls/articleshow/77566926.cms

BENGALURU: A 20-year-old man, Farhan Khan , was wrongly picked up on the suspicion of being involved in the DJ Halli riots. In more trauma for the youngster, by the time he was released by police, his 55-year-old father had a cardiac arrest and died.

Farhan lives in Kavalbyrasandra and works in Russel market. He was detained early on Wednesday. After concluding he was not involved in the violence in any manner, police freed him on Friday evening .

Muneer Ahmed, a close relative, recounted the events before and after the detainment. Farhan went to work on Tuesday morning and was expected to return home at 10pm. “But roads in the area were blocked and he got stuck. He phoned his father, Iqbal Ahmed , apprising him of the situation. Farhan finally made it home at midnight,” Muneer said.

Two and a half hours later, police showed up and took Farhan away for questioning. He pleaded with them that he was not a troublemaker, but in vain. Iqbal made urgent calls to relatives, seeking help to secure Farhan’s release. “On Wednesday itself, Iqbal suffered a cardiac arrest and breathed his last at a hospital,” Muneer said.

The body was handed over to the family on Friday after completion of Covid-19 protocol. “We urged cops to let Farhan see his father for the last time. By Friday evening, police gave him a clean chit,” Muneer said.

Over 200 people have been detained over the violence. “Many parents are calling me to say their sons are innocent. Investigations are under way, but it’s a matter of concern if police are picking up the wrong people, instead of nabbing the culprits, just to show numbers,” said Shivajinagar MLA Rizwan Arshad .

Kuldeep Kumar Jain, DCP (crime-1), said many people had been quizzed. “This was done based on suspicion stemming from prima facie evidence that puts them at the crime scene. Every arrest has been made after discovery of credible evidence and verification of the individual’s involvement in the case,” he said.

379,['16/08/2020'],Belarus leader says Putin offers help as pressure builds,"Belarus opposition supporters shout as they hold posters reading 'Stop lying!' (L) and 'Show people the truth!... Read More

MINSK: Vladimir Putin has offered to help ensure Belarus 's security, according to its president Alexander Lukashenko, as pressure builds on the strongman leader and opposition protesters prepare for a show of force Sunday.

Thousands demonstrated in the capital Minsk Saturday after main election challenger Svetlana Tikhanovskaya asked supporters to rally over the weekend and keep alive a movement that poses the biggest challenge to Lukashenko's hold over the ex-Soviet country.

Many gathered at the spot where Alexander Taraikovsky, 34, died on Monday during protests against an election the opposition says was rigged to give Lukashenko another term in office.

Demonstrators heaped flowers at the spot and the crowd chanted ""Thank you!"" and raised victory signs. Police kept a low profile.

Many held up photographs of protesters beaten during the crackdown, while one man stood in his underwear revealing the purple bruises on his thighs, buttocks and back.

Later thousands protested outside the Belarusian state television centre, complaining that their broadcasts backed Lukashenko and gave a skewed picture of the protests.

Around 100 staff came out of the building to join the crowd, and said they planned a strike on Monday.

""Like everyone we are demanding free elections and the release of those detained at mass protests,"" said one employee, Andrei Yaroshevich.

Riot police later arrived at the centre and blocked off the entrance to the building.

The opposition is planning a major show of force on Sunday with a ""March for Freedom"" through the streets of central Minsk.

Facing the biggest challenge to his rule since taking power in 1994, Lukashenko called in Moscow 's help and spoke on the phone with Putin Saturday, after warning there was ""a threat not only to Belarus"".

He later told military chiefs that Putin had offered ""comprehensive help"" to ""ensure the security of Belarus"".

The Kremlin said the leaders agreed the ""problems"" in Belarus would be ""resolved soon"" and the countries' ties strengthened.

While Lukashenko periodically plays Moscow off against the neighbouring EU, Russia is Belarus's closest ally and the countries have formed a ""union state"" linking their economies and militaries.

Lukashenko criticised Russia during his election campaign and Belarus detained 33 Russians on suspicion of planning riots ahead of polls.

Opposition protesters slammed Lukashenko for now seeking Moscow's aid and said they fear Russian intervention.

""It's obvious that our president can't deal with his own people any more, he's seeking help in the east,"" said Alexei Linich, a 27-year-old programmer.

""If Russia intervenes, that would be the worst. I'm really afraid of this,"" said Olga Nesteruk, a landscape designer.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday urged Lukashenko to ""engage with civil society"", during a trip to Poland, which has offered to act as a mediator.

Tikhanovskaya, a 37-year-old political novice who ran after other opposition candidates including her husband were jailed, accuses Lukashenko of rigging the vote and has demanded he step down so new elections can be held.

The 65-year-old has ruled Belarus with an iron grip and claims to have won the election with 80 percent of the vote.

Tikhanovskaya left the country on Tuesday for neighbouring Lithuania, with her allies saying she came under official pressure.

She is also demanding authorities be held to account for the crackdown, which saw police use rubber bullets, stun grenades and, in at least one case, live rounds to disperse protesters, with at least 6,700 people detained and hundreds injured.

Officials have confirmed two deaths in the unrest, including Taraikovsky -- who they say died when an explosive device went off in his hand during a protest -- and another man who died in custody in the southeastern city of Gomel.

On Friday authorities began releasing hundreds of those arrested and many gave horrific accounts of beatings and torture.

European Union ministers have agreed to draw up a list of targets in Belarus for a new round of sanctions in response to the post-election crackdown.

The leaders of the three ex-Soviet Baltic states -- Estonia , Lithuania and Latvia -- on Saturday condemned the crackdown and called for a new vote.

Lukashenko has dismissed the demonstrators as foreign-controlled ""sheep"" and ""people with a criminal past who are now unemployed"", repeatedly accusing foreign governments of plotting his downfall.

Tikhanovskaya on Friday announced the creation of a Coordination Council to ensure a transfer of power, asking foreign governments to ""help us in organising a dialogue with Belarusian authorities"".

She demanded the authorities release all detainees, remove security forces from the streets and open criminal cases against those who ordered the crackdown.

381,['16/08/2020'],How climate change could expose new epidemics,"PARIS: Long-dormant viruses brought back to life; the resurgence of deadly and disfiguring smallpox; a dengue or zika ""season"" in Europe.These could be disaster movie storylines, but they are also serious and increasingly plausible scenarios of epidemics unleashed by global warming, scientists say.The COVID-19 pandemic that has swept the globe and claimed over 760,000 lives so far almost certainly came from a wild bat, highlighting the danger of humanity's constant encroachment on the planet's dwindling wild spaces.But the expanding ecological footprint of our species could trigger epidemics in other ways too.Climate change -- already wreaking havoc with one degree Celsius of warming -- is also emerging as a driver of infectious disease, whether by expanding the footprint of malaria- and dengue-carrying mosquitos, or defrosting prehistoric pathogens from the Siberian permafrost.""In my darkest moments, I see a really horrible future for Homo sapiens because we are an animal, and when we extend our borders things will happen to us,"" said Birgitta Evengard, a researcher in clinical microbiology at Umea University in Sweden ""Our biggest enemy is our own ignorance,"" she added. ""Nature is full of microorganisms.""Think of permafrost, a climate change time bomb spread across Russia, Canada and Alaska that contains three times the carbon that has been emitted since the start of industrialisation.Even if humanity manages to cap global warming at under two degrees Celsius, the cornerstone goal of the 2015 Paris Agreement , the permafrost area will decrease by a quarter by 2100, according to the UN's climate science panel, the IPCC.And then there are the permafrost's hidden treasures.""Microorganisms can survive in frozen space for a long, long time,"" said Vladimir Romanovsky, a professor of geophysics at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks.As ground thaws, once-frozen soil particles, organic material and microorganisms that had been locked away for millennia are carried toward the surface by water flows, he explained.""That's how thawing can spread these microorganisms into present day environments.""There are already examples of ancient, long-frozen bugs coming to life.""When you put a seed into soil that is then frozen for thousands of years, nothing happens,"" said Jean-Michel Claverie, an emeritus professor of genomics at the School of Medicine of Aix-Marseille University in France.""But when you warm the earth, the seed will be able to germinate,"" he added. ""That is similar to what happens with a virus.""Claverie's lab has successfully revived Siberian viruses that are at least 30,000 years old.These reanimated bugs only attack amoebas, but tens of thousands of years ago there were certainly others that aimed higher up the food chain.""Neanderthals, mammoths, woolly rhinos all got sick, and many died,"" said Claverie. ""Some of the viruses that caused their sicknesses are probably still in the soil.""The number of bacteria and viruses lurking in the permafrost is incalculable, but the more important question is how dangerous they are.And here, scientists disagree.""Anthrax shows that bacteria can be resting in permafrost for hundreds of years and be revived,"" said Evengard.In 2016, a child in Siberia died from the disease, which had disappeared from the region at least 75 years earlier.This case has been attributed to the thawing of a long-buried carcass, but some experts counter that the animal remains in question may have been in shallow dirt and thus subject to periodic thawing.Other pathogens -- such as smallpox or the influenza strain that killed tens of millions in 1917 and 1918 -- may also be present in the sub-Arctic region.But they ""have probably been inactivated"", Romanovsky concluded in a study published earlier this year.For Claverie, however, the return of smallpox -- officially declared eradicated 50 years ago -- cannot be excluded. 18th- and 19th-century victims of the disease ""buried in cemetaries in Siberia are totally preserved by the cold,"" he noted.In the unlikely event of a local epidemic, a vaccine is available.The real danger, he added, lies in deeper strata where unknown pathogens that have not seen daylight for two million years or more may be exposed by global warming.If there were no hosts for the bugs to infect there would not be a problem, but climate change -- indirectly -- has intervened here as well.""With the industrial exploitation of the Arctic, all the risk factors are there -- pathogens and the people to carry them,"" Claverie said.The revival of ancient bacteria or viruses remains speculative, but climate change has already boosted the spread of diseases that kill about half a million people every year: malaria, dengue, chikungunya, zika.""Mosquitoes moving their range north are now able to overwinter in some temperate regions,"" said Jeanne Fair, deputy group leader for biosecurity and public health at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.""They also have longer breeding periods.""Native to southeast Asia , the tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) -- which carries dengue and chikungunya -- arrived in southern Europe in the first decade of this century and has been moving rapidly north ever since, to Paris and beyond.Meanwhile, another dengue-bearing mosquito, Aedes aegypti, has also appeared in Europe. Whichever species may be the culprit, the Europe Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has registered 40 cases of local transmission of dengue between 2010 and 2019.""An increase in mean temperature could result in seasonal dengue transmission in southern Europe if A. aegypti infected with virus were to be established,"" according to the Europe Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.As for malaria -- a disease that once blighted southern Europe and the southern United States and for which an effective treatment exists -- the risk of exposure depends in large part on social-economic conditions.More than five billion people could be living in malaria-affected regions by 2050 if climate change continues unabated, but strong economic growth and social development could reduce that number to less than two billion, according to a study cited by the IPCC.""Recent experience in southern Europe demonstrates how rapidly the disease may reappear if health services falter,"" the IPCC said in 2013, alluding to a resurgence of cases in Greece in 2008.In Africa -- which saw 228 million cases of malaria in 2018, 94 percent of the world's total -- the disease vector is moving into new regions, notably the high-altitude plains of Ethiopia and Kenya For the moment, the signals for communicable tropical diseases ""are worrying in terms of expanding vectors, not necessarily transmission,"" said Cyril Caminade, an epidemiologist working on climate change at the Institute of Infection and Global Health at the University of Liverpool.""That said, we're only tasting the aperitif of climate change so far,"" he added.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77569956,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-215363,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/environment/global-warming/how-climate-change-could-expose-new-epidemics/articleshow/77569902.cms

NEW DELHI: Over the 16 years that he lorded over the international cricket stage , fans had come to expect the unexpected from Mahendra Singh Dhoni . Even so, he managed to serve up a bolt from the blue on Saturday. On a relaxed I-Day evening, after completing his first practice session with Chennai Super Kings teammates following a five-month hiatus from cricket due to the lockdown, Dhoni posted a typically cryptic message on Instagram . “Thanks a lot for ur love and support throughout. from 1929 hrs consider me as Retired (sic),” Dhoni's message read, as Sahir Ludhianvi's ‘Main pal do pal ka shayar hoon’ sung by Mukesh played in the background.With that, Dhoni brought down the curtains on his international career, leaving most of his teammates stumped. Within minutes, his CSK and former India teammate Suresh Raina , too, announced his international retirement.Though Dhoni did not specify whether his announcement was only regarding international cricket, CSK sources indicated that both he and Raina would continue playing for the franchise at least till IPL’s 2021 edition.Dhoni's announcement marks the end of an era for Indian cricket. His numbers are staggering, but they do not begin to capture the impact of the once long-haired boy from Ranchi whose canny captaincy, ice-cool demeanour under nerve-racking pressure and unorthodox brilliance paved the way for some of Indian cricket's most memorable moments.As the news broke out after practice at MA Chidambaram Stadium, those in the CSK dressing-room rushed to speak to him. Dhoni shrugged and told them to check Instagram. “Just felt like it,” was all he said, and started planning for Monday's net session in his usual unflustured manner.

S Boobalan, the doctor’s assistant for the past 25 years, said he joined as a juvenile and started distributing tokens to patients at the clinic that was opened from 7.30pm to midnight. Boobalan, who dropped out of school after Class X, said, “He charged ?5 per patient when I joined. It was ?2 per patient when he started the clinic 45 years ago.”

Every day, more than 150 people came to consult Dr Thiruvengadam who often gave out free medicines and even gave some of them money, he said. “It’s a great loss to residents of the area.”

M Nathamuni, a retired LIC staffer and a relative, said, “Thiruvengadam, the only son among five children, was inspired to become a doctor by his uncles A Murugesan and A Kanniappan, both siddha practitioners.

His wife Saraswathi is a former railway employee, while his son Dipak is a final year medical student in Mauritius.

386,['16/08/2020'],MS Dhoni: From railway ticket collector to Indian cricket icon,"NEW DELHI: When MS Dhoni smashed the six that won the World Cup for India in 2011, it instantly became an iconic moment in cricket and established the man who started out as a railway ticket collector as one of the game's greats.Hard-hitting, unruffled no matter the pressure, the record of 'Captain Cool' -- and India's most successful captain --- will be virtually impossible to beat.Holding the inaugural World T20 trophy in Johannesburg, in a half-sleeved India vest in 2007 and hitting that six in the World Cup final against Sri Lanka at Mumbai's Wankhede stadium will forever remain etched amongst the most memorable Dhoni moments.Many will remember him as an accumulator of runs after being appointed India's one-day captain in 2007, but it was his style which set Dhoni apart.From humble beginnings in the eastern city of Ranchi, before working as a ticket collector on the railways in Kharagpur in West Bengal, to Indian cricket's poster boy with a fleet of superbikes, Dhoni's life has even been chronicled in a Bollywood biopic.His countless endorsement deals and TV ads not only made him a sports superstar to rival Sachin Tendulkar but also put him in the Forbes list of the world's richest athletes.In 2015, his income was estimated to be $31 million. But he had to keep up the success on the field to fuel such a lifestyle.N. Srinivasan, the industrialist who owns the Chennai Super Kings, where Dhoni will remain captain in the Indian Premier League despite announcing his international retirement on Saturday, hailed him as the supreme ""instinct"" player.""We're awash with data just now,"" Srinivasan said in a recent interview with the Scroll news website.""They play videos of every batsman whom they're going to come against and they see how he got out, what's his strength, what's his weakness etc.""So, MS Dhoni doesn't attend this, he's a pure instinct man. The bowling coach, (head coach Stephen) Fleming will be there and everybody will be there, everyone is giving opinions, (but) he'll get up and go,"" Srinivasan said.""In the context of instinct, he feels that okay he can assess a batsman or player on the field, that's his judgement.""It is a style that helped Dhoni lead India to the top of the sport after their World Cup triumphs.His 'keep them guessing' tactics also left fans in frustration over the past year as they waited to see whether Dhoni, who turned 39 in July, would play in the national blue jersey again.Dhoni, who quit Tests in 2014, last played for India in their semi-final loss to New Zealand in the 2019 World Cup.While India waited for a word from the master, Dhoni went off to serve with the army reserve unit where he is an honorary lieutenant colonel.But despite his remarkable finishing skills in the middle-order, excellent glove work and sharp reading of the game, it has become increasingly clear that Dhoni would have to let Virat Kohli take complete control.He stepped down from the limited-overs captaincy in 2017 on the pretext of preparing Kohli as a leader but continued to play a big part in the team's decision-making process.\Kohli never shied away from relying on the experience of Dhoni, who was often seen calling the shots from behind the stumps.India coach Ravi Shastri said that Dhoni's impact on the team had been ""massive"" and the communication with Kohli ""fantastic"".""As a keeper, he has shown over the years that no one is better than him in this format, not just in taking catches, inflicting run-outs or stumpings.""Dhoni was appointed Test skipper after Anil Kumble's retirement in 2008 and to lead the team across formats.He led by example scoring 4,876 runs including six centuries and 33 fifties in a nine-year Test career that began in 2005 against Sri Lanka.Dhoni stunned the cricket world by quitting Tests in 2014 after finishing as the country's most successful skipper in the five-day format with 27 wins in 60 matches.But he is also one of the most successful captains in the hugely popular IPL.Dhoni led Chennai to three titles in the money-spinning franchise tournament and eight runner-up finishes.He was furious after Chennai were banned for two seasons in 2015 along with Rajasthan Royals when team officials were found guilty of involvement in illegal gambling.""The biggest crime that I can commit is not a murder, it is actually match fixing,"" Dhoni said of the ban.His fans stood by him and Chennai won the title on their return.",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77569541,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-70113,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/cricket/news/captain-cool-ms-dhoni-from-railway-ticket-collector-to-indian-cricket-icon/articleshow/77569545.cms

CHENNAI: Moments after MS Dhoni announced his retirement from international cricket , his close friend and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) teammate Suresh Raina followed suit by announcing his exit from the international game . The two have enjoyed a tight bond over the years, having featured in many matches for CSK as well as the Indian team. “It was nothing but lovely playing with you, @ mahi7781. With my heart full of pride, I choose to join you in this journey. Thank you India. Jai Hind!” Raina said in an emotional post on Instagram. Both Dhoni and Raina are currently in Chennai and are gearing up for the IPL that will commence from September 19 in the UAE.While chances of an India recall looked unlikely for the 39-year-old Dhoni, who hasn’t played any competitive cricket since the World Cup last year, it could be argued that Raina still had time on his side to make an international comeback. The left-hander from Uttar Pradesh is 33 and harboured hopes of earning a recall at least in the T20 format, with two T20 World Cups scheduled for 2021 and 2022.The left-hander’s decision may have been influenced by the injuries he has suffered in the recent past. After the 2019 IPL, Raina suffered an injury on his left knee and underwent surgery, forcing him out of the game for the next 5-6 months. In fact, he hasn’t played a single competitive game since the end of the 2019 IPL. Nonetheless, Raina can bow out pleased with his achievements. He played 18 Tests, 226 ODIs and 78 T20Is and scored tons in all formats.",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77569528,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-213918,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/cricket/news/suresh-raina-follows-in-ms-dhonis-footsteps/articleshow/77568859.cms

398,['16/08/2020'],GBU hikes house rent by 5 times for cops on campus,"Representative image

GREATER NOIDA: A section of officers in the Noida police commissionerate has voiced discontent after the management of Gautam Buddha University (GBU), which has been housing the policemen on its campus, increased the house rent by more than five times.

In January this year, 38 new posts were created in the Noida police commissionerate and 26 senior-level and 1,400 junior-level officers inducted into the force.

The police had then asked the Noida and Greater Noida authorities to ensure housing for these personnel. Since a permanent housing complex was yet to be finalised, a section of the new officers was lodged on the GBU campus.

So far, GBU had been deducting Rs 2,400 as house rent allowance every month. However, in June, the university raised the monthly charge to Rs 15,000.

The officers were told they would be required to pay the revised rent from September.

With at least five DCP and ACP-level officers staying in these type IV houses with two bedrooms, a drawing room and a kitchen, the cops have asked for the decision to be reversed.

""We have to pay Rs 6,000-7,000 a month as electricity bill. Now, if the house rent is increased to Rs 15,000, we would have to shell out Rs 21,000-22,000 every month. This is one-third of our entire salary,"" an officer said. An officer is entitled to a house rent allowance of Rs 4,000 in rural areas and Rs 10,000 for urban. GBU falls in a rural area.

A group of police officers had met GBU vice-chancellor BP Sharma in July and demanded that the decision be withdrawn. ""We were assured of action. But nothing has been done so far,"" an officer said.

Sharma said, ""I have directed the registrar to work on this.""

Registrar SN Tewari said the rent had been raised for all ""outsiders"".

They were felicitated by corporation commissioner G Prakash.On Saturday, many such officials such as chief engineer L Nandakumar, city health officer Jagadeesan, law officer Jacob Rajan, revenue officer Chitti Babu, public relations officer Umapathi and chief vector control officer Selvakumar were presented with certificates. Medical officers, assistant engineers, sanitary inspectors and workers from each zones were also honoured.According to multiple officials, many of the employees who contracted Covid-19 were above 55 years and despite that worked fearlessly in containment zones. “During April-June, top officials visited containment zones and Covid care centres repeatedly and even interacted with suspected coronavirus patients on a daily basis. They did this without worrying about their own health,” an official said.This not only put them at risk but also their family members. Official sources said that spouses, children, parents and in-laws of senior officials were also infected with Covid and had to be hospitalised.Around 200 civic body officials of various categories have been infected and at least of them have 10 died but the fight against the deadly virus has not stopped, another official said.In one case, a senior civic body employee was admitted to a private hospital and had severe symptoms including inability to consume food.

EV without a battery:

A timely respite:

Hyundai’s electric jump:

NEW DELHI: This week was all about some exciting debuts, and a few automakers dropping teasers to test waters ahead of big launches. Respite to thousands as the Supreme Court allowed registration of BS4 vehicles sold during March. The buzz, however, was around the electric mobility. In this edition of TOI Auto Weekly , we bring you everything from the automotive domain that deserves your attention:2020 Mahindra Thar finally broke cover after a Covid-induced delay. Thar, the latest in Mahindra Classics lineage, is bigger and more practical, well-equipped and gets brand-new petrol and diesel engines with manual and automatic transmissions. The Thar comes with a retro-modern look and is launching on October 2. Ford India expanded the Freestyle line-up with the new Flair variant. The Freestyle Flair starts at Rs 7.69 lakh (ex-showroom) for the petrol variant and the diesel-based variant starts at Rs 8.79 lakh (ex-showroom). The Freestyle Flair boasts the 1.2-litre petrol or 1.5-litre diesel engine under the hood. The Flair variant flaunts an all-new sporty red and black theme and it will also feature the variant-exclusive upholstery inside.What Hyundai introduced this week in the globally market is a purist delight. Expanding the N line series, the 2021 Elantra broke into the scene with a 1.6-litre turbo petrol engine. The ‘parametric design’ of the sporty car give a very elegant yet sleek look to it. The Hyundai Elantra N Line is expected to enter the Korean market in the third quarter of 2020. After the launch of this car, Hyundai plans to roll out the new Elantra plug-in hybrid and the Sonata N Line.MG Gloster, the fourth product from SAIC-backed company, was teased, hinting at a festive launch. The SUV is expected to cost around Rs 50 lakh and will be a low volume product in India. The MG tries to club class-leading tech and features like lane departing warning, collision warning system under Gloster’s hood.EQC was one good news among the many from the world of electric vehicles. Mercedes-Benz teased the electric SUV EQC, as you head towards and India-debut during the festive season. The EQ brand of the German automaker had been introduced early this year, however, the launch of the EQC got delayed due to the Covid crisis. The Mercedes-Benz EQC sports a dual-motor all-wheel-drive powertrain with two asynchronous electric motors, one mounted on the front axle, and the other one on the rear.Toyota revealed the theme of the launch campaign of Urban Cruiser as the bookings are set to commence in August-end. The campaign theme, ‘Respect’, stems from the relatively young target audience’s aspiration for early success in life. The rebadged version of the Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza is expected to arrive in the upcoming festive season.We are closer to the new Duster. Renault will be driving in a turbo-petrol variant of Duster shortly. The SUV will be loaded with a new 4-cylinder, turbocharged 1.3-litre petrol engine. The turbo-petrol engine is borrowed from its cousin Nissan Kicks. With this new engine, Renault Duster will become one of the most powerful SUVs in its segment.The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways announced that the electric vehicles can now be sold and registered without battery packs. The sudden move is aimed at boosting the acceptance of electric mobility in the country also considering the fact that battery packs account for 30-40% of the total cost. The move has received mixed reactions from the manufacturers. Mahindra Electric MD said, ""No country in the world allows registration of EV's without battery. We will explain the government that this notification has created confusion. Either charging or swapping is post-sale charge replenishing methods. Both can coexist in the framework. The move has not been thought through and the industry has not been consulted.” While the likes of Hero Electric, Okinawa and Ather supported the move.After pulling up the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA) earlier, the Supreme Court finally allowed the registration of the BS4 vehicles which were sold in March. According to the reports, around 9,56,015 BS4 vehicles sold from March 12-31 faced the threat of getting their registrations voided.The power of electric: Hyundai Kona adds another feat to its name by clocking a record range of 1205 km in a single charge. The Kona was tested over a period of 3 days and the electric SUV also recorded the lowest power consumption figures which were well under the standard value determined by the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP). “This mission has proven that our Kona Electric offers outstanding electric performance efficiency and battery range,” said Michael Cole, CEO, Hyundai Motor Europe.Tesla better look out as its rivals are slowly trying to take the top spot in the electric mobility domain. Hyundai is ready with its ‘Ioniq’ line-up, with the Ioniq 5, a midsize EV CUV hitting the market in 2021. Hyundai plans to launch three new models in the next four years in a bid to challenge Tesla. On the other hand, Lucid Motors, from Tesla’s own home turf, will be pulling out its trump card soon. The Lucid Air, the first luxury model from the automaker, will be offering a 500-mile range on a single charge. The Lucid Air is expected to hit the market by early 2021.",auto,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77570250,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-313176,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//auto/news/toi-auto-weekly-new-thar-in-town-mercedes-benz-eqc-almost-there/articleshow/77570233.cms
401,['16/08/2020'],"As land prices spike in Telangana, so do bribe amounts","Representative image

HYDERABAD: Keesara tehsildar EB Nagaraju on Friday night was caught by ACB sleuths taking a bribe of Rs 1.10 crore. The bribe was offered in connection with a land in Rampally Dayara in Keesara mandal in favour of some persons and a real estate agency.

ACB officials said two businessmen offered the bribe to the tehsildar to issue the proceedings of the land and start developing it. Medchal-Malkajgiri district officials said an acre of land now costs Rs 20 crore and this could be the reason the businessmen offered him Rs 1.10 crore to settle the row over 28 acres.

This was only the tip of the iceberg of land litigations. Sources said skyrocketing land prices in Hyderabad and surrounding areas have become a major source of cash flow to some of the revenue employees. At least half a dozen major cases reported in the city and surrounding areas in the last one year have revenue officials caught in the web of bribery and land litigations.

A senior revenue official pointed out more complaints had started coming after the government initiated the land records updation programme (LRUP) in 2016 and Rythu Bandhu scheme. Due to high land rates, there is competition among the officers to bag plum postings like tehsildar in Rangareddy and Medchal districts. A majority of them get postings with the purported blessings of politicians, sources said.

A case in point: Nagaraju, who began his career as a junior assistant in the revenue department, continued to function in RR district despite rising through the ranks and expanded his network of operations.

“The entire department (revenue) is getting a bad name following the actions of a handful of officers, especially those working in Hyderabad and erstwhile RR districts. We have represented to the state several times to transfer field-level officers in the erstwhile RR district. But, our pleas have fallen on deaf ears,” Vanga Ravinder Reddy, president of Telangana Revenue Employees’ Services Association (TRESA), told STOI.

Interestingly, there was no let-up in the bribery cases involving revenue officers even after CM K Chandrasekhar Rao made no bones about the growing corruption in the department. “The fact that the department is being revamped, including a merger with the panchayat raj department shows the government’s seriousness in putting an end to corruption,” an official said.

Last year, ACB had come out with a list of ‘most corrupt’ departments based on the number of cases registered. The revenue department had the dubious distinction of topping the charts, followed by the municipal administration and home (police) department.

404,['16/08/2020'],Chennai: Civic body’s fever clinics initiative wins CM’s award,"Representative image

CHENNAI: The city corporation’s fever clinics have bagged the CM’s award for the second best initiative this year.

The civic body had started the camps in May when the daily Covid-19 case numbers in each zone were in double digits. It was also to avoid the emergence of a new cluster since the Koyambedu fiasco.

Chief minister Edapadi K Palaniswami on Saturday said fever clinics had helped break the transmission chain. Since May 8, 33,186 fever clinics have been held, with at least 500 being set up daily. On Saturday, 18,563 people visited 457 camps in 15 zones, with samples from 1,128 people being collected.

So far, about 18 lakh people have visited these camps where more than one lakh influenzalike flu (ILI) cases have been detected, with nearly 18,000 people testing positive. The positivity rate at fever camps is about 17%.

Before starting camps, corporation officials had to assure doctors on safety. “Camps are held for any communicable disease. But for Covid-19, it took some motivation to get doctors on board. Initially, only 20-50 camps were held. Our target was 100. We reached it within a week. Then it became 200 and now it is almost 500 every day. Also, getting people to the camp took a lot of coordination and effort,” said joint commissioner (health) P Madhusudhan Reddy. The solid waste department ensures cleanliness and sanitation, while the engineering wing helps with logistics and creates awareness. With new challenges every day, solutions such as auto ambulances, cabs to ferry patients to and from camps have come up. All drugs and safety equipment are given in bulk to doctors at camps where portable tents are used.

The award, commissioner G Prakash said, was a great recognition of the civic body’s efforts. “It was a collective effort.”

The speculation about another surge in Covid cases has been reinforced by the return of migrant workers from various districts of Bihar and eastern UP that have a high caseload.A series of meetings between administrative and health officials has been lined up from Monday to discuss the strategy that has to be implemented in the days to come. Over the past few weeks, the positivity rate across Delhi-NCR has come down with increased testing and tracing. But as economic activity is resuming and industries are reaching out to labourers who have left for their hometowns, officials fear that a ""reverse migration"" of migrants would lead to a spike in Covid cases.Narendra Bhooshan, the nodal officer for Covid response in the district, said, ""There is no restriction now on movement of people or transport. So, tracing those who are coming back to the district from Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh would be difficult in the absence of any cooperation from the stakeholders. We are going to deliberate upon a strategy that needs to be put in place to control the spread of the infection.""What has been a cause for concern is that most of these workers are expected to return from districts that have a high caseload. While Lucknow has more than 7,000 active cases, the number in Varanasi, Prayagraj (Allahabad) and Gorakhpur has crossed 2,000 this week. Even the interior districts of UP, such as Balia, Deoria, Basti and Kushinagar, have 900-1,000 cases on an average.The situation is similar in Bihar, where Patna, Begusarai, Nalanda, Saharsa, Araria, Buxar, Katihar and East Champaran are reporting a number of fresh cases.According to a rough estimate, around 80,000 workers had gone back home from Noida in May alone.Officials are currently devising a strategy to track the number of those returning.Noida district magistrate Suhas LY is expected to soon frame guidelines for industries, manufacturing units, construction firms and commercial establishments. Their owners would be asked to inform the integrated Covid control room about the workers who come back from their native places.The DM said he had asked the health department to come up with suggestions on checking the spread of the infection.

415,['16/08/2020'],South Africa 'regrets' United Arab Emirates-Israel peace agreement,"JOHANNESBURG: South Africa has voiced its concern over the normalisation of relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), saying it is ""regrettable"" that it had been done without engaging the people of Palestine.

""Peace and stability in the Middle East , and particularly a sustainable solution regarding the plight of the Palestinian people, is of critical importance to South Africa,"" the country's Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) said in a statement on Friday.

Acknowledging that the UAE had the sovereign right to set its diplomatic relations with the government of Israel, the statement said it was “regrettable” that it had done so based on an agreement related to the fate of the Palestinian people without engaging the people of Palestine.

Central to the UAE-Israel agreement was an undertaking by the latter to suspend plans to annex the West Bank, although Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a TV broadcast afterwards that he had only agreed to defer plans for the annexation.

""Most of the world's countries have called for a stop to the threats of annexation of the West Bank, as it would have been an act in contravention of international law. The agreement by three countries, the USA, the UAE and Israel instead posits that a temporary suspension of the annexation should be celebrated as a diplomatic break-through,"" DIRCO said in a statement.

The agreement, however, does not commit Israel to halting of plans to further extend Israeli sovereignty over Palestinian territories and its people, it said.

""The agreement also, does not commit the government of Israel to negotiations guided by the internationally agreed parameters,"" the statement said.

""South Africa notes the concerns expressed by the Palestinian leadership and wishes to express its conviction that any initiative aimed at a solution to the conflict, must take into account the needs and aspirations of the Palestinian people,"" DIRCO said.

""In this regard, South Africa remains committed to the independence of Palestine under the two-state solution, based on the international recognition and independence of the viable State of Palestine , based on the June 4, 1967, borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, existing peacefully side by side with its neighbours,” it said.

South Africa's view on Palestine is that the outstanding final status issues must be resolved through negotiations between the parties, with support from the international community.

HYDERABAD: How did small time grocer from Delhi become a director in a Chinese company that allegedly ran an illegal online gambling racket in India worth more than Rs 1,000 crore?

Police officers in Hyderabad are trying to answer this question after Neeraj Tuli , one of the three Indian directors held along with a Chinese national, told investigators that he was just an ordinary grocer who ran a small neighbourhood shop as an extension of his home in Delhi’s Karol Bagh area. He claimed he had no clue that his name was being used to run the company and found out about it only when cops reached his doorstep.

Tuli accused his chartered accountant neighbor, P Hemant, of tricking him into signing some documents which made him part of the business without his knowledge. Officials are on the lookout for Hemant who is missing.

“Tuli claimed that Hemant, under the pretext of helping him audit his accounts, got many documents signed by him. He said he did not know that Hemant would use them to make him a dummy director in Chinese firms. It is true that Tuli is a grocer, but we are not taking his claims at face value. He will be grilled further,"" said a senior officer.

Investigators are believed to have produced various documents in Tuli’s name, which declared him a director of various firms operating under Beijing T Power based out of China.

The eight firms – Growing Info Tech Pvt Ltd , Sily Consulting Services Pvt Ltd, Pan Yun Technology Services, Linkyun Technology Pvt Ltd, Dokypay Technology Pvt Ltd , SpotPay Technology India Pvt Ltd, Daisylink Financial Pvt Ltd and Huahuo Financial Pvt Ltd — were registered in India either in 2019 or 2020. All the firms belong to Beijing T Power, which was establishing new companies and running online gambling by admitting members only through references. Payment was accepted through different e-payment gateways.

The two other directors —Dheeraj Sarkar and Ankit Kapoor — were aware of the cheating, police said. “The key accused, Chinese national Yah Hao and Hemant officially have not been directors in any of these firms in India. But, they ran India operations and ensured transfer of hundreds of crores rupees to China,’’ an official added. English-speaking Yah Hao is generally tasked with studying the market potential in various countries.

MUMBAI: A father and son, arrested in 2017 for sexually abusing a “minor” relative were acquitted after the court found that the girl had told different versions of the incident to the police, doctor, magistrate and trial court.

The special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act court said the girl changed “the sequence of crime”. The court said that according to the FIR and her testimony, first the father outraged her modesty and later his son assaulted her. In the history given to the doctor, she said it was the son who outraged her modesty. “Such version is totally unreliable and cannot be relied upon,” the court observed. The court further said that sufficient documents were not submitted to show that the girl was 17 years old when the incident occurred in March 2017.

The FIR was lodged in June 2017, after the girl allegedly attempted suicide as she was unable to bear the ‘torture’. The girl had been living with her aunt, uncle and their son for two years when the incident allegedly occurred.

A membership in such a committee was the carrot that was being dangled to appease the OPS loyalists after the merger of his faction in August 2017 with the EPS-led AIADMK.While Palaniswami insisted on a meeting to resolve the issue of CM candidate, OPS opted for a joint statement to partymen, urging them to stay united and work for an electoral victory. The high drama on Saturday morning was triggered by the sudden appearances of posters across Theni district, an OPS turf, backing his candidature for the CM post for the 2021 assembly election. In no time, a delegation of 14 ministers, led by P Thangamani and S P Velumani, arrived at OPS residence.Panneerselvam had directed district functionaries to remove the posters, but the EPS camp went into a tizzy. The ministers assembled at senior minister D Jayakumar’s chamber and headed to OPS residence at 11.45am after the Independence Day event. Only a short while prior to that the CM had handed over the ‘best practice’ award to Panneerselvam (also the finance minister) for total computerisation of the department on the ramparts of Fort St George during the Independence Day celebrations.The talks lasted until 3pm when the ministerial team rushed from OPS’ house to EPS residence and returned to convey the CM’s message to his deputy. But all that came out of the exercise was a joint statement to partymen to remain united and work for the AIADMK’s victory.The genesis for the Saturday turmoil has been the rash of statements issued by ministers in the past two days – one backing EPS for CM candidature and another OPS even while a couple took the middle-path in cautioning partymen to leave it to the high level bodies of the party to take a call.In the last three years after J Jayalalithaa’s death and her aide V K Sasikala’s incarceration, EPS has strengthened his position in the party and government while the OPS support base has steadily eroded. None of his erstwhile supporters are with him any longer, but OPS has been flaunting the goodwill he enjoys among party cadre and the people as a weapon to challenge EPS, said a senior minister.“OPS told the delegation that the chief ministerial candidate could be decided during elections and this was not an appropriate time. The ministers then briefed EPS, who insisted on a meeting to settle the issue. But OPS stood his ground insisting that a steering committee be set up first,” said the minister. The CM candidate issue could well prove the big challenge for the AIADMK that has sustained on a dual leadership.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77576155,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-192961,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/edappadi-k-palaniswami-o-panneerselvam-power-play-out-in-open-fight-may-harm-party-in-elections/articleshow/77570617.cms

429,['16/08/2020'],Natural gas prices may be cut to decade low of $1.9; dent ONGC revenues,"Representational photo.

NEW DELHI: Prices of natural gas in India are likely to be cut to $1.9-1.94 - the lowest in more than a decade - from October, denting revenues of producers such as ONGC who are already incurring huge losses on gas production.

A gas price revision is due from October 1 and going by the changes in the benchmark rate in gas exporting nations, the price is likely to be anywhere between $1.90 to $1.94 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu), sources privy to the development said.

This will be the third straight reduction in rates in one year. Prices were cut by a steep 26 per cent to $2.39 per mmBtu in April.

Prices of natural gas, which is used to produce fertiliser and generate electricity and is also converted into CNG for use in automobiles as fuel and cooking gas for households, are set every six months -- on April 1 and October 1 each year.

Sources said the cut in prices would mean a widening of losses for India's top oil and gas producer ONGC.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) had posted Rs 4,272 crore loss on gas business in 2017-18, which is likely to widen to over Rs 6,000 crore in the current fiscal (April 2020 to March 2021), they said.

ONGC has seen incurring losses on the 65 million standard cubic meters per day of gas it produces from domestic fields shortly after the government in November 2014 introduced a new gas pricing formula that had ""inherent limitations"" as it was based on pricing hubs of gas surplus countries such as the US, Canada , and Russia .

The current $ 2.39 per mmBtu rate is the lowest in more than a decade.

Sources said ONGC in a recent communique to the government has stated that the break-even price to produce gas from new discoveries was in the range of $ 5-9 per mmBtu.

In previous years, loss from the gas segment was getting offset from the gain from the oil business. But with oil business itself coming under severe strain due to a sharp slump in benchmark prices, it has become difficult for the company to meet even the operating expenses, they said.

In May 2010, the government had raised the rate of gas sold to power and fertilizer firms from $ 1.79 per mmBtu to $ 4.20.

ONGC and Oil India Ltd (OIL) got $ 3.818 per mmBtu price for the gas they produced from fields given to them on nomination basis and after adding 10 per cent royalty, the fuel cost $ 4.20 per mmBtu for consumers.

The Congress-led UPA had approved a new pricing formula for implementation in 2014 that would have raised the rates but the BJP-led government scrapped it and brought a new formula.

The new formula takes into account the volume-weighted annual average of the prices prevailing in Henry Hub (US), National Balancing Point (the UK), Alberta (Canada), and Russia with a lag of one-quarter. Prices are set every six months -- on April 1 and October 1 each year.

The rates at the first revision, using the new formula, came to $ 5.05 but in the subsequent six-monthly reviews kept falling till they touched $ 2.48 for April 2017 to September 2017 period. Subsequently, they rose to $ 3.69 in April 2019 to September 2019 before being cut by 12.5 per cent in October 2019 to $ 3.23.

“After the demise of former chief minister Jayalalithaa, there is no strong leadership in the ruling party. The dual leadership, which has scant regard for the party’s ideology, is hurting the party’s interests,” he said. The present leaders of the AIADMK are “puppets” in the hands of the BJP, he said.

“The Centre had usurped several of TN rights. Admissions in state-run medical colleges were usurped through NEET. Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami is not doing anything to protect the interests of the state. Leaders were keen on promoting their own political future,” said Vijay, who had joined the AIADMK in 1977. Vijay was health minister for 2.5 years in the 2011-16 AIADMK government.

People who walked primarily to places like work and the grocery store from their homes, for example, reported better health than people who walked mostly for leisure.""We found that walking for utilitarian purposes significantly improves your health and that those types of walking trips are easier to bring into your daily routine,"" said Gulsah Akar , an associate professor of city and regional planning in The Ohio State University Knowlton School of Architecture.""So, basically, both as city planners and as people, we should try to take advantage of this as much as possible.""The study used data from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey, a U.S. dataset collected from April 2016 to May 2017.The researchers analysed self-reported health assessments from 125,885 adults between the ages of 18 and 64. Those adults reported the number of minutes they spent walking for different purposes - from home to work, from home to shopping, from home to recreation activities and walking trips that did not start at their homes.And, the survey respondents ranked how healthy they were on a scale of 1 to 5. The dataset the researchers analysed included more than 500,000 trips.The researchers - Akar and Ohio State doctoral student Gilsu Pae - found that walking for any duration, for any purpose, increased how healthy a person felt.But they also found that an additional 10 minutes of walking per trip from home for work-based trips - say, from a person's house to the bus stop 10 minutes away - increased that person's odds of having a higher health score by 6 per cent compared with people who walk for other reasons. People who walked from home for reasons not connected to work, shopping or recreation were 3 per cent more likely to have a higher health score.And, the researchers found, people who walked for work walked faster - on average, about 2.7 miles per hour - than people who walked for other reasons. People who walked for recreational purposes - say, an after-dinner stroll - walked, on average, about 2.55 miles per hour.The researchers also found that walking trips that begin at home are generally longer than walking trips that begin somewhere else. The team found that 64 per cent of home-based walking trips last at least 10 minutes, while 50 per cent of trips that begin elsewhere are at least that long.Akar has studied the ways people travel for years and said she was surprised to see that walking for different purposes led to a difference in how healthy people believed they were.""I was thinking the differences would not be that significant, that walking is walking, and all forms of walking are helpful,"" she said. ""And that is true, but walking for some purposes has a significantly greater effect on our health than others.""Akar said the findings suggest that building activity into parts of a day that are otherwise sedentary - commuting by foot instead of by car, for example - can make a person feel healthier.""That means going to a gym or a recreation centre aren't the only ways to exercise,"" Akar said.

442,['16/08/2020'],No prelim investigation report for Air India Express crash crash?,"MUMBAI: A week has passed following the Air India Express Calicut crash that killed 18 people. Since then, over a dozen airline flights have been landing in Calicut daily, flying in about 2000 passengers. But there has been no official word yet on initial findings from the investigators, neither for the benefit of pilots operating into these table top runways nor for the sake of families of the deceased, let alone to assuage the concerns of the flying public at large, said air safety experts.

Going by a recent statement from the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), the final report into the crash will be submitted by January next year. There was not word on the preliminary report, which under International Civil Aviation Organisation Annex 13 norms should preferably be released in a month’s time. Indonesia released a preliminary report after Lion Air October 2018 crash, so did Ethiopia after Ethiopian Airlines March 2019 crash and most recently, Pakistan after the Pakistan International Airlines May 22 crash. The report informs the pilot community at large about the factors surrounding the crash.

Wing commander (Wg Cdr), K Dinesh , a former Indian Air Force (IAF) officer said: ``Waiting longer than required to learn lessons from a crash is akin to pushing aviation safety out of the window. It’s important to identify, without much delay, what happened and convey it to relevant stake holders, which is where the relevance of initial, preliminary reports come in. It is the most important aspect in the chain of accident prevention. Final report can come later.” He added that the much heard refrain in India; ``Let’s wait for the final report is a bureaucratic approach to accident prevention.”

Wg Cdr Dinesh, an aviation safety consultant, has been part of IAF ``Go Team’’ , that rushes to the site to make a first assessment of what went wrong. Unlike accidents that occur in remote areas or over the sea, those that take place at airports leave several clues, he says. ``The Go Team can make an assessment, within a day or two, of what most likely went wrong. It’s based on evidences collected from the scene, wreckage, speaking to air traffic control, first responders etc. The assessment is usually 99 % correct. Based on the findings, immediate advisories are issued to avert any further similar accident. The findings are also made public to assuage fears. These are the important aspects, the final report can come later,” he added.

Civil aviation accident investigations too look into that aspect. For instance: US National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) circular about its investigation process says: ``Atleast once daily during the on-scene phase of an investigation, one of the five members of the safety board itself, who accompanies the Go-Team , briefs the media on the latest factual information developed by the team…There is no speculation over cause. ’’

Capt Amit Singh, an air safety expert said that the Indian Procedure Manual of Accident investigation, 2012 (6.1.1) says that a preliminary investigation report should be submitted preferably within ten days of the accident. ``It shall contain the requisite information including any safety hazard, either in human factor, aircraft factor or other relevant factor that is prima facie evident during the early stage of investigation such as lack of piloting proficiency, if any… to enable framing and implementation of immediate corrective safety measures,’’ he quoted. He added: ``What we have till now is random statements, by authorities, made to different media organisations that are not backed with facts or data.”

Under ICAO norms, an accident investigation should not be carried out to apportion blame. It should be carried out only to know the causes of the accident so as to prevent future occurrences. ``Waiting for months together to learn the lessons goes against the very purpose of carrying out an investigation,’’ says Wg Cdr Dinesh .

``There is a pressing need to form a robust ‘Go Team’ within the Accident Investigation Bureau which reports the preliminary understanding of cause of accident. The ‘Go team’ assessment can be make public by the competent authority, obviously with the needed caveats. It is the obligation of the airline, the regulator and the state to assure the citizens and families of victims with bulletins on findings that would be update regularly. It is scientifically proven that a true news is more palatable for families of victims than cover ups,” he added.

""We would work together to strengthen India's defence and also I might add its capabilities as a counterterrorism partner. On the question of terrorism, specifically, we have no tolerance for terrorism, in South Asia or anywhere else: cross border or otherwise,"" he said.

During the Obama Administration, he said, he was in various meetings of the National Security Council on this issue.

""We used every tool at our disposal to make sure that our citizens and the citizens of our partners were safe and that's something we would build on in a Biden Administration,"" Blinken said.

Former Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Nisha Desai Biswal said that the US-India partnership was vitally important as the defining partnership for 21st century as the Obama administration characterised it.

""You cannot have a deep, trusted partnership between the United States and India, if you deeply disrespect the people of India and people of Indian origin. Peoples' ties are so fundamentally important in all of the different ways in which this relationship really is set apart. Without that, without those ties between our peoples, then it's really just a transactional relationship to achieve a means to an end, so to speak,"" Biswal said.

She was responding to a question on the recent steps taken by the Trump administration with regard to H-1B visas that has an impact on a large number of Indian technology professionals.

In June, President Donald Trump banned the entry into the US of workers in several key non-immigrant visa categories, including the H-1B until the end of the year, arguing that they eat into American jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those affected include the family members of the H-1B, L-1, and certain categories of J1 visas.

However this week, the Trump Administration announced certain exemptions in H-1B and L-1 travel ban for those continuing employment with the same employer, a move that could help Indian IT professionals and those working in the healthcare sector.

The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.

""US India partnership is not just a means to an end. It is actually fundamentally a whole of society partnership between our people, our educational institutions, our academic universities, our businesses, and our cultural fabric of both countries. The successive waves of immigrants from India to the US shores have been an important aspect of America's economic, political, and social fabric,"" she said.

Ajay Bhutoria, who is on the National Finance committee for Joe Biden, said that he is in this fight to restore the soul of ""our nation for all of Americans and Indian Americans"".

""Over 20 years as an entrepreneur in the Bay area, I have reached that dream and work to make sure it's there for others in our community. That's what led me to help Vice President Biden and Dr. Biden on their Free Community College An initiative that has helped so many immigrants and young people get an education and a good job,"" he said.

Last week, Biden scripted history by selecting Indian origin Senator Harris, 55, as his running mate in the US presidential election. Harris, whose father is an African from Jamaica and mother an Indian, is the first-ever Black vice-presidential nominee.

Presidential elections in the US will be held on November 3 and the 77-year-old is challenging incumbent Republican President Donald Trump in the polls.

""Fifteen years ago, I was leading the efforts to approve the historic civil nuclear deal with India. I said that if the US and India became closer friends and partners, then the world will be a safer place,"" Biden, who was vice-president in the Obama administration, said while addressing the Indian-American community on India's Independence Day.

If elected president, Biden said, he will continue to believe this and also continue to stand with India against the threats it faces from its own region and along its borders.

Biden said that he will work on expanding two-way trade between the US and India, and take on big global challenges like climate change and global health security.

If elected, the Democratic candidate said, he will work to strengthen the democracies where diversity is the mutual strength.

On this day, let us ""continue to deepen the bond that endures between our nation's and our people,” Biden said.

He said that ""as President, I'll also continue to rely on the Indian-American diaspora, that keeps our two nations together, as I have throughout my career"".

""My constituents in Delaware, my staff in the Senate, the Obama administration that had more Indian-Americans than any other administration in the history of this country, and this campaign with Indian Americans at senior levels, which of course includes the top of the heap, our dear friend ( Kamala Harris ) who will be the first Indian American vice president in the history of the United States of America,” Biden said.

""We all know she's smart, she's tested, she's prepared. But another thing that makes Kamala so inspiring is her mother's immigrant story to the US that started in India, with pure courage that brought her daughters to this moment. I know the pride you feel. It's your story too,"" Biden said.

""For your sacrifices, and your family's courage, you became pillars of our community and our country. You're patriots and the frontlines of this pandemic. In this reckoning of systemic racism, you're making real real promise that America is a place where people of all races and religions can live together in peace,"" he said.

""But I know it's hard. My heart goes out to all those of you who have been the targets in a rise in hate crimes, and the crackdown of legal immigration, including a sudden and harmful actions on H-1B visas. That for decades have made America stronger and brought our nation's closer,"" Biden said.

The H1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.

""While it's sometimes may not feel like the US of your dreams, we will overcome and build back better than ever. Like (former President) Barack Obama had asked to me, I'm asking Kamala Harris, to be the last person in the room to ask the tough questions of me, provide counsel, most of all to always represent the belief in possibilities,"" the former US vice president said.

Around 1.3 million Indian-Americans are expected to vote in this year's election, with nearly 200,000 in battleground states like Pennsylvania and 125,000 in Michigan, according to the research firm CRW Strategy.

In the 2016 presidential election, 77 per cent of Indian Americans voted for Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton.

President Donald Trump has been seeking to win over Indian voters, praising Indian-Americans as business and technology leaders.

They are believed to be the same persons who caused the accident that killed her.The arrest comes five days after the accident in Bulandshahr's Aurangabad area. The kin of the 19-year-old deceased Sudeeksha had alleged that their daughter was harassed by the men on a Bullet motorcycle.The arrested accused have been identified as Deepak Chaudhary and Raju Kumar who were traced after SIT probing the case scanned through ownership of at least 10,000 Bullet bikes in the district and multiple CCTV footages in and around the accident spot.While Deepak, seen driving the bullet in CCTV footages, works with a local architect, 50-year-old Raju is a mason by profession and the duo were on their way to a construction site at the time of the accident, their interrogation revealed.As per Bulandshahr police, panicked over the media limelight in the case, Deepak not only got his motorcycle repaired but modified it in a bid to throw police off the scent once it began looking for the bullet. As per investigators, Deepak got new tyres, registration plate, silencer and covered the bullet with a camouflage sticker to give it a complete makeover.Based on the complaint of the family of deceased, Bulandshahar police has already registered a case under section 304-A (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 279 (rash driving) and relevant sections of motor vehicle act against unidentified suspects at Aurangabad police station in the district.A three-member SIT was formed under circle officer Diksha Singh over allegations of harassment and eve-teasing in what was initially claimed by the police as an accident.

Former Indian Cricket team skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni announced his retirement from international cricket yesterday. He shared a video on his Instagram handle and updated fans about the same. In no time, the news of his retirement took the internet by storm. Bollywood celebs and his fans got emotional and started posting pictures and videos of him on social media.Today, Ranveer Singh , who is currently at home due to the coronavirus pandemic, took to his Instagram handle and took a walk down the memory lane. Ranveer is a huge Dhoni fan and he penned a long emotional note for him.Ranveer revealed how he first met MS Dhoni in Karjat’s studio while he was working as an assistant director. He also shared a few pictures with Dhoni which included his first ever picture with him. Sharing the pictures, he wrote, “This little gem of a photo is one of my prized possessions. It was taken around the year 2007/08 at ND Studio in Karjat. I was about 22 years old, working as an assistant director. I took up this particular job only because the ad film featured the one & only MS Dhoni. I was overworked and underpaid, but I didn’t care- I just wanted to be in His presence. I was even injured at the time, but I worked through the pain in the hope that as a reward for my sincere efforts, I would be granted a chance to briefly meet MSD and maybe get a photo with him. When I finally met him, I was completely awestruck. He was so humble, so down-to-earth, full of grace and exuded an unmistakable aura of kindness. My love, respect and reverence for him grew even stronger.”Ranveer further added how after his first film ‘ Band Baaja Baaraat ’, he rushed to meet Dhoni after their hairstylist Sapna Bhavnani called him. He wrote, “After I did my first movie, Sapna (who was our common hairstylist at the time) called me one day and said ‘hey I know you’re a massive MSD fan, he’s shooting at Mehboob studio, come & meet him if you’d like’. Man-oh-man! I just dropped everything and rushed to the studio to meet him! He was jovial and warm and praised my performance in BBB. We hung out, I had my cap and jersey signed by him, like a true fanboy. That day, I felt like I was walking on the clouds! Since then, every time that I have the good fortune of meeting him, I am left energised and enthused, as if a big brother has blessed me with energy and motivation to go out and be the best that I can be. 🙏🏽”Towards the end, the actor tagged Dhoni as ‘one of the greatest sportsmen to have ever lived’. “MSD is one of the greatest sportsmen to have ever lived. I’m lucky to have witnessed his playing career in my lifetime. A paragon of excellence. An icon of the sport.

CHENNAI: Former health minister Anbumani Ramadoss on Saturday wrote to the union minister for health and family welfare, Harsh Vardhan, demanding that the eligibility mark for foreign medical graduates’ examination ( FMGE ) be reduced to 30%. At present, only 16% of the students appearing for the exam are clearing it.

Around 50,000 medical graduates have completed their education in foreign countries and are awaiting registration in India. Various restrictions and the FMGE, which is deliberately made difficult and nearly impossible to pass, have made their services not available to the Indian public, he said in the letter to the minister to point out the decreasing pass percentage in FMGE. The exam would be conducted on August 31.

“A large number of students from our country are studying undergraduate medical courses, which is equivalent to MBBS, in Russia, the US, Philippines, Kyrgyzstan, Ukraine, China, Germany and other countries.

Every year, around 10,000 students go abroad to join medical education,” said the sitting Rajya Sabha MP and PMK’s youth wing president.

After returning to India, all except those who studied in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have to clear the FMGE to be eligible to register with the Medical Council of India and its state units. “It has made the future of thousands of Indian students, who are studying medicine in foreign countries, a big question mark.”

The backlog of failed students is increasing every year, he said. “The reason for the high failure rates are the very difficult question papers. These graduates who have studied in foreign medical colleges that have good infrastructure are not able to get 50% marks (150 marks out of 300 marks) because the question paper is set to such a high standard, much above the ones set for local graduates in their qualifying examinations,” he said.

461,['16/08/2020'],"What's happening at the US Postal Service, and why?","NEW YORK: The US Postal Service is warning states it cannot guarantee that all ballots cast by mail for the Nov. 3 election will arrive in time to be counted, even if ballots are mailed by state deadlines. That's raising the possibility that millions of voters could be disenfranchised.

It's the latest chaotic and confusing development involving the agency, which has found itself in the middle of a high-stakes election year debate over who gets to vote in America, and how. Those questions are particularly potent in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, which has led many Americans to consider voting by mail instead of heading to in-person polling places.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends mail ballots as a way to vote without risking exposure to the virus at the polls. But President Donald Trump has baselessly excoriated mail ballots as fraudulent, worried that an increase could cost him the election. Democrats have been more likely than Republicans to vote by mail in primary contests held so far this year.

Some questions and answers about what's going on with the post office and the upcoming election:

WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE POST OFFICE?

The Post Office has lost money for years, though advocates note it's a government service rather than a profit-maximizing business.

In June, Louis DeJoy, a Republican donor and logistics company executive, took over as the new postmaster general and Trump tasked him with trying to make the Postal Service more profitable. Doing so would also squeeze businesses such as Amazon. Its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has come under criticism from Trump because of the coverage the president has received from The Washington Post, which Bezos owns.

DeJoy cut overtime, late delivery trips and other expenses that ensure mail arrives at its destination on time. The result has been a national slowdown of mail.

The Postal Service is hoping for a $10 billion infusion from Congress to continue operating, but talks between Democrats and Republicans over a broad pandemic relief package that could have included that money have broken down.

On Thursday, Trump frankly acknowledged that he's starving the postal service of that money to make it harder to process an expected surge of mail-in ballots. Trump on Saturday attempted to re-calibrate his position. He said that he supports more funding for the postal service but refuses to capitulate to other parts of the Democrats' relief package -- including funding for cash-strapped states.

WHY DOES THIS MATTER IN AN ELECTION YEAR?

Mail-in ballots have exploded in popularity since the pandemic spread in mid-March, at the peak of primary season. Some states have seen the demand for mail voting increase fivefold or more during the primaries. Election officials are bracing for the possibility that half of all voters or even more will cast ballots by mail in November.

Colorado, Hawaii , Oregon, Utah and Washington state have universal mail voting, and California, Nevada and Vermont are starting universal mail voting in November. But the rest have little experience with such a volume of ballots cast through the mail.

Timely mail is key to voting by mail. In states without universal mail-in voting, applications for mail ballots are generally sent out to voters by mail. They're returned, again, by mail. Then the actual ballots are sent to voters by mail, and returned, again, by mail, usually by Election Day.

Late last month, Thomas J. Marshall, the post office's general counsel and executive vice president, sent states a letter warning that many of them have deadlines too tight to meet in this new world of slower mail.

Pennsylvania, for example, allows voters to request a mail ballot by Oct. 27. Marshall warned that voters there should put already completed ballots in the mail by that date to ensure they arrive by Nov. 3.

This has been a potential problem since the Obama administration, when the post office relaxed standards for when mail had to arrive. But it's particularly acute when the volume of mail ballots is expected to explode in states such as Pennsylvania, which only approved an expansion of mail voting late last year. It's also acute when the president has said openly he wants to limit votes by his rivals by keeping them from voting by mail.

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

It's unclear. The first question is whether there will be a coronavirus relief bill that could help fund the post office. Republicans and Democrats are far apart on the measure and Congress has gone home for a few weeks.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats are considering calling the House back into session to address the Postal Service, according to aides familiar with a Saturday evening leadership call. One aide said the House could return next week or the following week. The aides were not authorized to discuss the call publicly and requested anonymity.

If there's no resolution of the coronavirus aid, the matter is sure to come up during negotiations in September to continue to fund the federal government. The government will shut down if Trump doesn't sign a funding bill by Sept. 30.

States can also act to change their mail balloting deadlines. That's what Pennsylvania did this past week, with the state asking a court to move the deadline for receiving mail ballots back to three days after the Nov. 3 vote, provided the ballots were placed in the mail before polls close on Election Day.

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and some other Democratic lawmakers are also seeking a review of DeJoy's policy changes. In response to the letter, spokeswoman Agapi Doulaveris of the U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General said the office is ``conducting a body of work to address the concerns raised.'' She declined to elaborate.

465,['16/08/2020'],'Do something:' Harris' rapid rise driven by call to action,"SACRAMENTO: Hours before Kamala Harris took the stage for the first time as Joe Biden 's vice presidential pick, she received a text message from a childhood classmate with photos from their school days.

A pensive Harris sits on the floor, dutifully looking ahead, a child in the center of an experiment in racial integration. She was among students who took the bus from their neighborhoods to school in the more affluent hillsides of Berkeley, California .

“That's how it started. There's no question!” Harris, 55, texted back to Aaron Peskin, the former classmate and now a San Francisco supervisor.

Fifty years later, she's the first Black woman and first Asian American woman named to a major party presidential ticket, joining Biden in his fight to defeat Republican President Donald Trump .

Harris's path toward the second-highest office in the United States has tracked the nation's ongoing struggle for racial equality. The start-and-stop progress and sometimes messy debate has shaped her life: an upbringing by immigrant parents, a childhood among civil rights activists, a career at the helm of a flawed criminal justice system and her rapid ascent in Democratic politics.

Those experiences forged a politician who is unafraid to buck the political powers that be, but also charts a cautious course through policy debates. She's emerged as a leader who knows the power of tough questioning and a viral moment, and also the weight of her role as a voice for women of colour.

“My mother Shyamala raised my sister Maya and me to believe that it was up to us and every generation of Americans to keep on marching,” Harris said Wednesday. “She'd tell us: Don't sit around and complain about things. Do something.” Her fast rise hasn't been without criticism, including on her shifting policy positions. She endured questions familiar to women in politics, particularly women of color, about her ambition. Trump labeled her “nasty” for her piercing interrogation of his nominees. Some progressive Democrats, meanwhile, view her work as a prosecutor skeptically.

Her own presidential bid, announced before 20,000 people in her hometown of Oakland, ended before voting began as she struggled to raise money or find a clear message.

She was a Howard University graduate with no high-powered ties when she returned to her native Bay Area for law school and took a job at the Alameda County District Attorney's office in 1990.

In 2003, she decided to run for San Francisco district attorney, challenging her former boss, Terence Hallinan. He was progressive, and Harris tacked right on the issues to run against him, pledging to be tough on crime and repair relationships with police. She also took on the cause of Black mothers who lost their children to homicide and felt Hallinan was neglecting the cases.

Harris, then 39, handily won the race.

Just months into her tenure, Harris decided not to seek the death penalty against a man charged with killing a police officer. The move angered law enforcement officers and drew rebuke from US Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the city's former mayor and a force in California politics.

But years later, when she ran for attorney general and needed statewide support, Harris tempered her stance on capital punishment, pledging to uphold it if elected and staying silent on ballot measures to repeal it. She appealed a 2014 decision by a federal judge calling it cruel and unusual punishment and won, keeping capital punishment on the books. Today, she wants a federal moratorium.

Observers and critics point to these episodes as evidence of Harris's penchant for staking out cautious positions that uphold the status quo. Her allies say she worked within the confines of the system and the politics of the time. As district attorney, she launched a reentry program that connected nonviolent offenders to jobs and education that became a national model.

“I remember the first time I visited the county jail. So many young men, and they were mostly Black or brown or poor,” she writes in her 2019 book, “The Truths We Hold,” recalling her time as a young prosecutor. “They represented a living monument to lost potential, and I wanted to tear it down.” At the same time, she took on truancy and supported a statewide law modeled off her city initiative that threatened parents with jail time, fines and lost public benefits if their kids missed school.

Harris barely won her race for state attorney general in 2010. Soon the Black Lives Matter movement was taking hold, along with outrage over police brutality, particularly against Black youth.

Harris declined to support state legislation that would have required her office to investigation fatal police shootings. Now Harris backs such investigations.

As attorney general she met then-Vice President Joe Biden's son, Beau, her counterpart in Delaware . The two worked together on a settlement with the nation's five largest mortgage lenders following the foreclosure crisis. Joe Biden said this past week that relationship was key in his decision to tap Harris as his running mate. Beau Biden died of a brain tumor in 2015.

In 2016, Trump won the presidency and Harris her US Senate seat. By the next year, Trump's brief tenure had convinced Harris that her perspective, particularly as a Black woman, should be represented in the Democratic primary field, said Nathan Barankin, Harris's former chief of staff. (AP)

Also, the Brazilian Association of Animal Protein (ABPA) has stated that till date there is no scientific evidence that the virus can transmit through meat.According to reports, Covid-19 can spread by touching a surface or object -- including food or food packaging that has the virus on it -- and thereafter touching mouth, nose, and eyes.WHO says that there is no evidence to date of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses being transmitted via food or food packaging. Coronaviruses cannot multiply in food; they need an animal or human host to multiply.Once the virus was detected, health authorities in Shenzhen immediately traced and tested people who might have come into contact with the product and all results came negative.Calling it as a precautionary drill, the authorities are now tracing related products from the same brand that have already been sold and are cross checking to minimize the chances of contamination via chicken wings and other food products.This is not for the first time that traces of virus have been found on food. Since July, there have been seven instances where the virus was detected on the packaging of imported seafood products across the country.Keeping the cases in view, Chinese health authorities have repeatedly requested the public to be cautious about buying imported meat and seafood.As per reports, Chinese social media has called for the suspension of all frozen food imports.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77571017,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-641518/77571017.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/food-news/chicken-wings-test-covid-positive-in-china-this-is-what-scientists-have-to-say/articleshow/77571017.cms

NEW DELHI: Players and fans on Sunday urged India's cricket board to retire Mahendra Singh Dhoni 's number seven jersey in a tribute to the two-time World Cup-winning (T20I and ODI) captain.Dhoni, 39, called time on his 16-year-old international career on Saturday with a cryptic message on his Instagram post that read ""From 1929hrs consider me as retired"".The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) confirmed the news in a statement, saying: ""The boy from Ranchi, who made his ODI debut in 2004, changed the face of Indian cricket with his calm demeanour, sharp understanding of the game and astute leadership qualities.""Dhoni's legions of fans, including 7.8 million Twitter followers, and former teammate Dinesh Karthik said they did not want to see 7 on the back of any other Indian cricketer's jersey.""I hope the @bcci retire the #7 jersey in white ball cricket Good luck with your second innings in life , I'm sure you'll have a lot of surprises for us there too,"" Karthik, a wicketkeeper-batsman, tweeted.Former batsman Mohammad Kaif agreed, writing on Twitter: ""Can't imagine any one else wearing a Number 7 India jersey again.""There is no provision to retire jerseys in cricket, unlike in football.But the BCCI unofficially retired batting great Sachin Tendulkar's number 10 shirt a few years after his retirement.Dhoni, a flamboyant wicketkeeper-batsman who led India to win the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup in 2007 and lifted the 50-over showpiece event in 2011, was born on July 7.He is a self-confessed fan of Portuguese football megastar Cristiano Ronaldo, who also wears a famous number seven jersey.""@BCCI should retire ""Jersey Number 7"" as a Tribute to Legend MS Dhoni ,"" a fan wrote on Twitter.Another fan urged social media users to start trending ""#RetireJersey7"" as ""Jersey number 7 was not just a number but an emotion the country is going to miss"".Dhoni, dubbed 'Captain Cool' because of his unflappable style, will continue to lead his team Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League starting in the United Arab Emirates next month.Dhoni quit Tests in 2014 and has not played for the national side since India's World Cup semi-final loss against New Zealand in England last year -- his 350th one-day international.Cricketers from across the globe and Indian media paid tribute to the glittering career of Dhoni, who was fondly called 'Mahi' by his teammates.The Times of India newspaper splashed across its front page: ""The end of an era: Dhoni calls it a day, Mahi way.""""Welcome to the retirement club, MSD! What a magical career!,"" former England batsman Kevin Pietersen tweeted.Australian opener David Warner wrote: ""Congrats @msdhoni on a fantastic career, he is one of the coolest guys I've played against on the park.""""One of the true legends of Indian cricket and one of the greatest captains, congratulations on a great career MS Dhoni!

But police said rocket fallout caused damage to a house in the town of Sderot, and paramedics treated a 58-year-old man for minor wounds from exploding glass.The Israeli army said the strikes were a response to explosive balloons launched by Hamas-affiliated group over the border, and attempts by Palestinian protesters to throw explosives at the Israel-Gaza perimeters fence and soldiers stationed along it.Dozens of Palestinians took part in protests along the perimeter fence.

JHARKHAND: LOUDSPEAKER LESSONS

ASSAM: MISS IS CALLING

KERALA: TELLY TEACHERS

CHHATTISGARH: It takes a villager…to teach a village

The sound of Shyam Kishore Gandhi’s Bullet motorbike is the new school bell for the students of Bankhati Upgraded Middle School. As the vehicle sputters to a halt, students from across Bankhati in Jharkhand’s Dumka district gather outside for their classes. For the next three hours, Gandhi, the headmaster, and a group of teachers read out lessons from loudspeakers strategically placed across the village. Gandhi struck upon the idea while touring the village after the lockdown was announced. “I realised that of the 246 students, 204 did not have access to the internet. How could we possibly help them? Then we found loudspeakers in the village kept for a function and hit upon this idea,” he says. The idea of the mohalla class has been such a hit that it is being replicated in other villages in the district.Dumka deputy commissioner Rajeshwari B says, “Internet access and smartphones are limited in the area and the loudspeaker initiative has helped students continue with their classes. We have also created WhatsApp groups at the district, block and school level of parents, teachers and administration to ensure that learning material is circulated.” The plan to scale-up the experiment is in the works, she adds.In Chhattisgarh’s left- wing extremism affected district, Sukma, teachers have similarly taken it upon themselves to make trips to villages where children have no phones and internet.In Assam’s Goalpara, the administration has used a mix of radio and telephones to connect with students. Assam had to face two floods besides the pandemic and 40% of Goalpara’s population was impacted. But the silver lining was that 70% of the households had access to a smartphone. Teachers and college students have been roped in for psychological counselling, clearing doubts or just chatting over the phone with students. Varnali Deka, Goalpara district collector, says Mission Tarang was able to reach out to 10,000 students with 1,500 teachers taking time out to make calls.The administration also translated learning material in Rabha, Garo and Bodo languages for easy understanding and these “knowledge kits” were distributed with mid-day meals during the lockdown.When news broke that a Kerala student had died by suicide because she could not access her classes on TV, it galvanised the entire state. Celebrities, politicians, ordinary folk pitched in to donate smartphones and television sets. “We had estimated that of the 47 lakh students in the state, about 2.5 lakh did not have access TVs, but now that gap has been completely covered,” says K Anvar Sadath, CEO of KITE (Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education). Kerala is among the many states that has used the telly to beam educational content to students. The KITE Victers educational channel which is carried by cable operators and DTH crossed over 1,000 sessions recently.With schools shut, the challenge was to create new learning spaces, says Unicef Chhattisgarh ’s education specialist Sheshagiri K M Rao. Unicef collaborated with the state government to create a robust volunteer-driven seekh mitra programme. Chetan Patel , 25, is a factory worker in Chhattisgarh’s Dhamtari district who has recently turned into a seekh mitra (learning volunteer) for children in Baagod village. “Schools were shut and when I was asked by the people running the seekh mitra programme if I could volunteer my time, I agreed. It is a difficult time and we must pitch in whatever way we can,” he says.The volunteers are given a “pitara” or bag that has learning material allocated for the week—Mondays and Tuesdays for language called Bhasha Somvaar, Wednesdays and Thursdays for Maths called Ganith Budhvaar and Fridays for games or Maazedaar Shukravaar. “We release three new videos every week, with a different subject and volunteers show these videos and do activities around them,” says Moolchand Markandey, cluster academic coordinator in Dhamtari district.The seekh mitra explains the concepts of maths and language based on the video to the group, encouraging students to talk about what they have learnt and involves them in non-contact games like maindak daud (frog race).",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77571868,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-108896,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/four-unique-jugaads-that-are-helping-bridge-indias-education-gap/articleshow/77571146.cms

A cantilever is a rigid structural element which extends horizontally and is supported at only one end"".""Typically it extends from a flat, vertical surface such as a wall or pier, to which it must be firmly attached. Cantilever construction allows overhanging structures without additional support. Employment of this technology will make the bridge look aesthetically better,"" he added.The bridge will have eight 'spans', which will rest on nine pillars on the riverbed.Dayal said the design of the bridge was finalised using the 'Building Information Modeling' (BIM) technology. With the help of this technology, a 3D model of the bridge was uploaded with intricate details of the proposed structure.""For the finalisation of the Phase IV designs, DMRC’s engineers are using the BIM platform, through which they have been able to finalise the designs even during the days of the pandemic when physical meetings weren’t possible. This bridge crosses the Yamuna at about 385 metres downward of old Wazirabad Bridge and 213 metres upstream of existing Signature Bridge,"" he further added.Dayal said, ""All mandatory approvals from the concerned agencies have been obtained for the construction of the bridge.

482,['16/08/2020'],ms dhoni: India's growth in cricket is due to MS Dhoni: Madan Lal,"File image of MS Dhoni (AFP Photo)

NEW DELHI: India's growth in cricket is due to Mahendra Singh Dhoni , said former cricketer Madan Lal after the World Cup-winning captain announced his retirement from international cricket on Saturday.

Lal added that had India not won the World T20 in 2007 and the ODI World Cup in 2011 after 28 years, then things could have been different.

""If any team does not win constantly, then it gradually starts slipping down. Dhoni was among the finest captains in the world,"" Lal said while speaking to ANI.

Pointing out that Dhoni perhaps decided that 2019 World Cup would be his last, Lal added, ""It seems Dhoni had already decided that the 2019 World Cup would be his last. After his last match in the World Cup, he did not play even a single first-class match.""

Lal, who was an all-rounder and part of the Indian team that won India's first World cup in 1983, went on to say that retirement is always a ""personal decision"".

""We all knew Dhoni would retire one day or the other. Anybody's retirement is always a personal decision. It is always sad to see big cricketers retire. The vacuum created by them is difficult to fill. People like Dhoni come in decades, just like Kapil Dev, Sachin Tendulkar or Sunil Gavaskar. These cricketers are of a rare breed,"" Lal further said.

When asked if Dhoni retired perhaps because he did not want to play under any other captain, Lal refuted such possibility.

""This is not the right thing to say. He has played under Virat Kohli too. When Dhoni was captain, he took everyone along. On the field, he also helped Kohli on decision-making, which was a sign of a great cricketer. He always kept the team ahead of himself.""

Lal also said that Dhoni's retirement is an opportunity for young cricketers; however, it would be difficult to fill his shoes.

On Saturday, Dhoni took to Instagram to announce his retirement from international cricket. While announcing his decision, Dhoni shared a video with a caption that said, ""Thanks a lot for ur love and support throughout. from 1929 hrs consider me as Retired.""

The video had the iconic Bollywood song 'Mai Pal Do Pal Ka Shayar Hu' from actor Amitabh Bachchan's famous movie 'Kabhie Kabhie' playing in the background.

In the video, Dhoni shared his incredible journey with Team India, which included his run out in the 2019 World Cup semifinal against New Zealand.

487,['16/08/2020'],Four unique jugaads that are helping bridge India's education gap,"Many underprivileged students have been unable to access online learning but some enterprising initiatives, often powered by local communities, are taking the classroom home.The sound of Shyam Kishore Gandhi's Bullet motorbike is the new school bell for the students of Bankhati Upgraded Middle School. As the vehicle sputters to a halt, students from across Bankhati in Jharkhand's Dumka district gather outside for their classes. For the next three hours, Gandhi, the headmaster, and a group of teachers read out lessons from loudspeakers strategically placed across the village. Gandhi struck upon the idea while touring the village after the lockdown was announced. ""I realised that of the 246 students, 204 did not have access to the internet. How could we possibly help them? Then we found loudspeakers in the village kept for a function and hit upon this idea,"" he says. The idea of the mohalla class has been such a hit that it is being replicated in other villages in the district.Dumka deputy commissioner Rajeshwari B says, ""Internet access and smartphones are limited in the area and the loudspeaker initiative has helped students continue with their classes. We have also created WhatsApp groups at the district, block and school level of parents, teachers and administration to ensure that learning material is circulated."" The plan to scale-up the experiment is in the works, she adds.In Chhattisgarh's left- wing extremism affected district, Sukma, teachers have similarly taken it upon themselves to make trips to villages where children have no phones and internet.In Assam's Goalpara, the administration has used a mix of radio and telephones to connect with students. Assam had to face two floods besides the pandemic and 40% of Goalpara's population was impacted. But the silver lining was that 70% of the households had access to a smartphone. Teachers and college students have been roped in for psychological counselling, clearing doubts or just chatting over the phone with students. Varnali Deka, Goalpara district collector, says Mission Tarang was able to reach out to 10,000 students with 1,500 teachers taking time out to make calls.The administration also translated learning material in Rabha, Garo and Bodo languages for easy understanding and these ""knowledge kits"" were distributed with mid-day meals during the lockdown.When news broke that a Kerala student had died by suicide because she could not access her classes on TV, it galvanised the entire state. Celebrities, politicians, ordinary folk pitched in to donate smartphones and television sets. ""We had estimated that of the 47 lakh students in the state, about 2.5 lakh did not have access TVs, but now that gap has been completely covered,"" says K Anvar Sadath, CEO of KITE (Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education). Kerala is among the many states that has used the telly to beam educational content to students. The KITE Victers educational channel which is carried by cable operators and DTH crossed over 1,000 sessions recently.With schools shut, the challenge was to create new learning spaces, says Unicef Chhattisgarh's education specialist Sheshagiri K M Rao. Unicef collaborated with the state government to create a robust volunteer-driven seekh mitra programme. Chetan Patel, 25, is a factory worker in Chhattisgarh's Dhamtari district who has recently turned into a seekh mitra (learning volunteer) for children in Baagod village. ""Schools were shut and when I was asked by the people running the seekh mitra programme if I could volunteer my time, I agreed. It is a difficult time and we must pitch in whatever way we can,"" he says.The volunteers are given a ""pitara"" or bag that has learning material allocated for the week-Mondays and Tuesdays for language called Bhasha Somvaar, Wednesdays and Thursdays for Maths called Ganith Budhvaar and Fridays for games or Maazedaar Shukravaar. ""We release three new videos every week, with a different subject and volunteers show these videos and do activities around them,"" says Moolchand Markandey, cluster academic coordinator in Dhamtari district.The seekh mitra explains the concepts of maths and language based on the video to the group, encouraging students to talk about what they have learnt and involves them in non-contact games like maindak daud (frog race).",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77571444,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1981819,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/education/news/four-unique-jugaads-that-are-helping-bridge-indias-education-gap/articleshow/77571436.cms
