CHICAGO: Bantering during the final night of the Democratic National Convention, actor Julia Louis-Dreyfus and former presidential candidate Andrew Yang repeatedly got the name of ""our current vice president"" wrong. Was it ""Mika Pints?"" or ""Paints?"" Or maybe ""Ponce,"" Yang suggested. ""Oh, some kind of weird foreign name?"" Louis-Dreyfus asked.

""Yeah, not very American sounding,"" Yang replied.

It was a quick bit of satire with a pointed message from Democrats: When top Republicans - including President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence - mispronounce Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris ' first name, it's not just disrespectful, it's racist.

Harris' first name is pronounced ""KAH'-mah-lah"" - or, as she explains in her biography, ""'comma-la,' like the punctuation mark.""

But mispronunciations have been rampant in the days since the California senator became the first Black woman and the first Asian American woman named to a major party's ticket. Pence referred to her as ""kah-MAH'-lah,"" putting his emphasis on the second syllable, at events last week.

Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel did the same on Wednesday, as did Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania on Thursday, the day after Harris delivered a prime-time speech accepting the Democratic nomination - a speech he indicated he watched.

Harris' supporters say the pattern amounts to a deliberate effort by Trump and his allies to portray Harris - the daughter of immigrants - as someone who does not belong at the top ranks of politics.

The mispronunciations follow a string of attacks that include racist and sexist memes and questioning about whether Harris, who was born in California, is eligible to serve as vice president because her mother was Indian and her father Jamaican. (Constitutional scholars and other legal experts say there is no question that she is eligible.) ""It is an effort to diminish her,"" said Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women's Law Center Action Fund. ""It's designed to signal difference."" Trump campaign officials did not immediately respond to questions about the errors.

To be sure, Harris isn't the only politician who has watched other politicians and voters trip over her name. Former President Barack Obama, whose father was from Kenya, used to crack jokes about being a ""skinny kid with a funny name.""

Former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, whose father was from Malta, went mostly by ""Pete"" - though his campaign made posters, chants and T-shirts with the pronunciation ""Boot-Edge-Edge."" In the introduction to her biography, Harris says her name means ""lotus flower.""

It's a symbol of significance in Indian culture, she wrote, noting ""a lotus grows underwater, its flower rising above the surface while its roots are planted firmly in the river bottom."" When she first ran for the US Senate, her campaign produced a video with small children demonstrating the proper way to say her first name.

But her defenders say Harris is well past the point of introduction - especially with Republican opponents. Harris served as California's attorney general for seven years before being elected to the Senate in 2016. Since then, she's made headlines for tough questioning of Trump appointees and raised her profile even more with her bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

And even before she was elected to the Senate, Trump knew who she was - he donated to her 2014 campaign for attorney general.

Yet Trump has continued to get her name wrong, as have his allies.

Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani called Harris ""Pamela"" during an appearance on Fox News. Pence mispronounced her names multiple times during a stop last week in Iowa, where he warned a cheering crowd that the November election isn't about a choice between Republicans and Democrats or conservatives and liberals.

""I think the choice in this election is whether America remains America,"" he said, going on to mispronounce her name moments later.

Pence pronounced Harris' name correctly during an appearance on Fox News on Friday, hours after the exchange between Louis-Dreyfus and Yang.

Fox News host Tucker Carlson grew agitated when a guest corrected him last week after he also pronounced Kamala incorrectly. ""So what?"" he said, before mispronouncing her name again and complaining about liberals being too sensitive.

McDaniel also got the pronunciation wrong earlier this week during an appearance on Fox News, even though the host questioning McDaniel was saying it correctly. Many people, particularly people of color, relate to Harris having her name mispronounced because they face the same situation in workplaces and elsewhere, said Goss Graves. She's grappled herself with people mispronouncing her first name - it's fah-TEE'-mah - and whether, or when, to correct them.

But it's a very different thing, she said, to be a candidate for one of the highest offices in the world and have your colleagues and members of the media repeatedly mispronounce your name - or not care enough to get it right.

""When people are running for the highest levels of government, there's an expectation they will be afforded with dignity and respect,"" she said.

SOUTHAMPTON: Zak Crawley converted his maiden Test hundred into a superb innings of 267 on Saturday as England piled on the runs against Pakistan in their series finale at Southampton before James Anderson rocked the tourists with a late treble strike.Crawley and Jos Buttler , who made 152, shared a stand of 359 that powered England to 583-8 declared on the second day of the third Test.England, 1-0 up in a three-match contest and looking for a first series win over Pakistan in a decade, then saw Anderson reduce the tourists to 24-3 at the close -- a deficit of 559 runs -- as he moved to within four of becoming the first paceman to take 600 wickets in Tests.Shan Masood was plumb lbw for four before fellow opener Abid Ali (one) edged Anderson low to Dom Sibley at third slip.And with what became the last ball of the day, Anderson had star batsman Babar Azam lbw for 11 with one that cut back.Anderson had stumps figures of 3-13 in 5.5 overs.England's total was their highest in Tests since they made 589-8 declared against Pakistan at Old Trafford four years ago.Three of Pakistan's frontline bowlers conceded over 100 runs each, with leg-spinner Yasir Shah (2-173 from 39 overs) and teenage paceman Naseem Shah (1-109 in 27) both going for more than four an over.Crawley's innings was the seventh highest maiden hundred in 143 years of Test-match cricket and the 10th highest score by any England batsman.His partnership with Buttler was also a new England fifth-wicket record in Tests, surpassing the 254 shared by Keith Fletcher and Tony Greig against India at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai in February 1973.One of the few false shots of his innings saw Crawley, 186 not out at lunch, go to 200 when he edged a four past second slip off Naseem -- his 25th boundary in 331 balls.But he still received applause from his team-mates in a match being played behind closed doors because of the COVID-19 outbreak.The 22-year-old Crawley was the seventh England batsman to turn his maiden Test hundred into a double century and the first since Rob Key against the West Indies at Lord's in 2004.Earlier, Buttler completed just the second hundred of his 47-match Test career and first as a wicketkeeper.Crawley, advancing down the pitch, lofted Yasir over long-off for six before a clipped boundary off paceman Mohammad Abbas saw him to 250.But his near 10-hour innings end when he was stumped down the legside by Mohammad Rizwan off part-time spinner Asad Shafiq.Crawley faced 393 balls, hitting 34 fours and one six, in what was the 10th-highest Test score by an England batsman.Together with Buttler, he had taken England from 127-4 to 486-5 against an increasingly ragged Pakistan.World Cup-winner Buttler saw his seven-and-a-half-hour innings -- the longest of his career -- end tamely when he chipped a gentle return catch to Fawad Alam, another occasional spinner.England resumed Saturday in a commanding position at 332-4.Crawley was 171 not out, in his eighth Test, with Buttler unbeaten on 87.Buttler, in a morning interrupted by rain breaks, had moved on to 99 when, after opposing wicketkeeper Rizwan came up to the stumps, he was given out caught behind off Abbas.Buttler immediately reviewed umpire Richard Illingworth's decision and replays showed the ball had missed the bat.Next ball, Buttler punched Abbas through point to complete a 189-ball hundred with 10 fours and two sixes.It was just the 29-year-old's second Test century in 47 Tests following his 106 against India at Nottingham two years ago.",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77697695,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-187405,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/cricket/pakistan-in-england/3rd-test-day-2-zak-crawley-hits-double-century-before-james-anderson-rocks-pakistan/articleshow/77697727.cms
2,['23/08/2020'],India rejects reference to J&amp;K in China-Pak joint statement,"NEW DELHI: India rejected the reference to Jammu & Kashmir in a joint statement issued by Pakistan and China after talks between foreign ministers of the two countries in Beijing on Saturday.

In a statement on Saturday, MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said, ‚ÄúJ&K is an integral and inalienable part of India and we expect the parties concerned to not interfere in matters that are internal affairs of India.‚Äù

Chinese and Pakistani foreign ministers Wang Yi and Shah Mehmood Qureshi met in Hainan on Friday for their second strategic dialogue. A joint statement issued at the meeting said ‚Äúboth sides underlined that a peaceful, stable, cooperative and prosperous South Asia was in common interest of all parties. Parties need to settle disputes and issues in the region through dialogue on the basis of equality and mutual respect‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe Pakistani side briefed the Chinese side on the situation in J&K, including its concerns, position and current urgent issues‚Äù, it said.

‚ÄúThe Chinese side reiterated that the Kashmir issue is a dispute left over from history between India and Pakistan, which is an objective fact, and that the dispute should be resolved peacefully and properly through the UN Charter, relevant Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements. China opposes any unilateral actions that complicate the situation‚Äù, the joint press release said.

In a statement New Delhi said: ‚ÄúIndia has repeatedly conveyed its concerns to both China and to Pakistan on the projects in so-called China Pakistan Economic Corridor, which are in the territory of India that has been illegally occupied by Pakistan. We resolutely oppose actions by other countries that change the status quo in Pakistan occupied Jammu and Kashmir and call on the parties concerned to cease such actions.‚Äù

The Pakistan foreign minister went to China after receiving little comfort from Saudi Arabia and OIC regarding taking up the Kashmir issue at the international level.

Singer, actor and producer Ammy Virk had built a home gym at his place in Mohali only few months before the lockdown was imposed in March. The fitness conscious Ammy had built the gym at his sprawling bungalow for his personal use, but little did he know that his gym was soon going to cater to fitness goals of friends from the entertainment industry! While India was still debating over going into a lockdown in early March, word about the pandemic was also spreading fast thereby increasing panic among people who began taking precautionary measures on their own and stopped going to public places like gyms etc. One of them was Sonam Bajwa who was still in Punjab at that time and shooting for her next film with Ammy Virk, 'Puaada' . Being the fitness freak that Sonam is, the actor didn't want to give up on her daily workouts and jumped at the offer made by Ammy for working out at his home gym. ""While waiting for the shooting units to take their call on whether to shut shootings or not and when to do so in March when I was in Punjab, I was going to Ammy's gym for my workouts,"" says Sonam.Thereafter, when the lockdown was imposed, while Sonam went back to Mumbai, other Punjabi actors who stay in Mohali, like Mankirt Aulakh, made use of time off in the curfew to walk it to Ammy's gym. One of them was also ' Teri Meri Ladai ' singer, Maninder Buttar . ""I did two things in the lockdown, workout and made music. I stay close to Ammy paaji's house, almost stone's throw away. So, I utilised my time gyming at this home gym,"" says Buttar, adding with a laugh, ""It seems he had made his home gym for us and knew that a pandemic is coming and people like us will need a home gym for workout!""",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77697311,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-472904/77697311.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/punjabi/movies/news/ammy-virk-kept-actors-fit-in-the-lockdown/articleshow/77697329.cms

PLANTABLE GANESHAS

Every year, in the run up to Ganesh Chaturthi , the markets in Lucknow are abuzz with activity as Ganpati idol sellers line up hundreds of idols, both big and small, for devotees to buy and take home. This year, while not deserted, the markets are not as busy with idol makers across Lucknow reporting a 70-80% decline in their sale. Also, unlike every year, this year there are no pandaals in the city, making the celebrations again a low key affair. In fact, given the COVID-19 situation, all visarjan in public places is banned and as a result, most devotees are opting for eco-friendly smaller Ganeshas, mostly made of clay. ‚ÄúThe sale for small and simple idols made of kachchi and pakki mitti is high this year and the Ganesh idols made of POP (Plaster Of Paris), which don‚Äôt dissolve easily is negligible,‚Äù says Ravi, a seller at IT College crossing.Mukesh, a stall owner in Jankipuram, says the sales have been disappointing. ‚ÄúWe had ordered a few eco friendly idols which can be immersed at home in a tub. Since they are slightly costly, not many people are going for them. And since you can‚Äôt do visarjan, people aren‚Äôt buying POP ones as well. In short, a majority is skipping to celebrate the festival this year,‚Äù he says.Mehak Arora, a homemaker in Vikas Nagar, who celebrates the festival in a lavish manner every year will skip it this year. Our friends and family used to eagerly wait for the Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations every year at our place as we would really go all out to bring Bappa at our house. But this year, since we are so scared about the COVID 19 situation in the city, with cases touching new benchmark every day, we will not be bringing Bappa home this year. We don't want to take any chance. We will just do routine pooja at home,"" says Mehek.Lucknow-based artist Pankaj Gupta who makes six to eight feet tall handmade idols of Lord Ganesha says, ""Due to COVID-19 majority of us have been taking precautions and staying at home. So this year I've introduced an eco-friendly Ganesha made out of Sadhu clay which comes from Maharashtra. The best part about this is that I don't use any paint or chemical while making the idol. It dissolves completely in a bucket full of water in just a few hours. Later the same water can be used in watering the plants.""Monica Bhonwal who has been making Ganesha idols for many years out of kacchi mitti said, ""We have been receiving so many phone calls from customers this year enquiring about eco-friendly Bappa idols. Due to the pandemic people aren't allowed to carry out processions, hence are opting for smaller environment friendly idols. There's no denying that procuring the required raw material for the idols has been difficult considering the current scenario, we have tried to manage and get most out of whatever we had.""Manu Shukla, main organiser of Peeli Kothi Ganesh Utsava, says. ‚ÄúThis year we are going low-key by avoiding the pandals and any public gatherings. The festival along with the pooja and visarjan shall be shared live on Facebook for all the devotees.‚Äù Bharat Bhushan Gupta, Trustee of Shri Ganesh Prakritic Committee has also planned to keep the celebrations low key. Gupta said, ‚ÄúSince there will be no pandals, the idol of Lord Ganesh will also be smaller. Outsiders won‚Äôt be allowed to attend the Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations. Only committee members shall be allowed to be a part of the Bhoomi Visarjan this year. Devotees can perform darshan on Facebook live.‚ÄùAnuradha Gupta founder of Prithvi Innovations, follows the principle of upcycling and afforestation while making God‚Äôs idols. She says, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve made plantable beej Ganesh idols. We have varying sizes but due to Covid, this year most people are opting for smaller sized idols.

Pune Municipal Corporation () may have called them ‚Äòchariot tanks‚Äô, decked them up with a fresh coat of paint and flowers, but the real identity of the mobile contraptions doing the rounds to enable immersion of Ganesh idols at citizens‚Äô doorsteps was not lost on the devotees of. Most are enraged to see garbage vats being sent around filled with chemical laced water for the auspicious act and have protested that it has hurt their religious sentiments.To his credit, the Mayor,, hit upon the idea to localise the immersion process down to the last mile, to avoid crowding of immersion tanks around the city, in view of the pandemic. To start with, 15 such ‚Äòchariots‚Äô are to be deployed by all 15 ward offices, with a plan to add 15 more to the fleet. About 4.5 lakh idols are immersed every year in the civic body‚Äôs jurisdiction, with the ritual kicking off right after Ganesh Chaturthi.On Saturday, some of the citizens spied these ‚Äòchariots‚Äô already on the streets and were shocked to recognise them as the heavy metallic garbage vats, instead of new plastic tanks as they imagined. ‚ÄúWe spotted the chariot on Jangli Maharaj Road on Saturday and were appalled to see that these were no immersion tanks but garbage bins converted for the occasion.This is preposterous. Why is PMC playing with the emotion of devotees? If the idea was to save on money, the civic body should have just gone with immersion tanks already built in each ward office with a lot of investment,‚Äù observed Subhash Jadhav, a resident of Kasba Peth.He added that the issue is going to be raised. ‚ÄúClearly, a lot has been spent on decorating the trucks. The money could have been better utilised in acquiring smaller plastic tanks,‚Äù he pointed out.‚ÄúThe COVID-19 situation has already clipped the festival‚Äôs fanfare. We‚Äôve accepted that. But the least PMC could have done was make proper arrangements for the immersion of household idols. We can only pray Lord Ganesh gives some wisdom to the people running the civic body. I certainly will not immerse my idol in these tanks,‚Äù declared Prashant Doshi, aresident of Apte Road.Jumping into the scene, Yogesh Sasane,(NCP) corporator from Hadapsar, said, ‚ÄúThe intention was to ensure more devotees do the immersion at home, but PMC was unable to provide adequate quantity of ammonium bicarbonate to enable that. Now they expect people to immerse their idols in ghanta gaadis and garbage containers!‚ÄùSharpening his attack, he argued, ‚ÄúSmall drums could have served the purpose, but PMC preferred to play with devotees‚Äô sentiments. A couple of years ago, it dumped the immersed idols in a stone quarry, treating them like debris. PMC could have pressed its large manpower for the task. The mayor was absolutely wrong in making this decision.‚ÄùWhile Mohol could not be reached for his view on the protests, municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar defended, ‚ÄúTrue, the garbage vats have been converted into immersion tanks, but they‚Äôve been decorated in attractive colours and with flowers to make the experience a pleasant one for people immersing their idols.

Due to restricted celebrations, small businesses that usually thrive at this time of the year, have taken a massive hit. Lalbaugcha Raja, Mumbai's best-known sarvajanik Ganeshotsav mandal cancelled its usual large-scale famed festivities and instead, conducted a blood and plasma donation camp as part of its covid campaign.As people will be restricted to congregate, this year a majority of the public Ganeshotsav mandals have converted the celebrations into 'Aarogyotsav' (Health Festival).The usual fervour of the festival might be missing but that failed to dampen people's spirit and enthusiasm as they welcome the cheerful 'Vignaharta' praying to him to set humanity free from the coronavirus. 22 Aug 2020, 8:50PM IST | 29400 views | Source : Mirror Online",mumbai,https://www.mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/photo/77695320.cms,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/how-mumbai-celebrated-ganeshotsav-amid-restrictions/articleshow/77699354.cms

Ventilators from a Gujarat- based firm failed a clinical evaluation by the Health Ministry‚Äôs technical committee, revealed information accessed through the Right to Information Act. Jyoti CNC Automation from Gujarat was one of the two fi rms that had already received Rs 22.5 crore in advance payment for indigenously manufactured ventilators in May forfunded by PM-CARES. However, by July, it was dropped from the list, according to the Ministry‚Äôs response to an RTI request fi led by activist Anjali Bhardwaj.The firm became the centre of controversy in May after Ahmedabad Civil Hospital Chief Medical Officer wrote to the state government‚Äôs medical services provider, saying that they were ‚Äúnot able to bring desired results‚Äù according to the head of the anaesthesia department.However, despite the controversial and doubtful performance of Dhaman-1 ventilators, the Centre placed an order for ventilators from Jyoti CNC. The RTI revealed that ventilators from Jyoti CNC andMedTech Zone (AMTZ) were not included in the list of recommended suppliers following clinical evaluation, according to the Health ministry‚Äôs July 20 response.So, even though the firm reportedly received an advance payment from the health ministry in May, their ventilators had not been installed in hospitals across the country till July. Meanwhile, following clinical evaluation, the reduction in list of manufacturers has reportedly cut down the PM CARES order for ‚ÄòMade in India‚Äô ventilators from 58,850 units to 40,000. These ventilators range from Rs 1.6 lakh to Rs 8.6 lakh per unitJyoti CNC Automation reportedly received Rs 8-crore advance for 5,000 units costing Rs 121 crore.Whenspoke to Jyoti CNC CMD Parakramsinh Jadeja, he said, ‚ÄúWait and watch, the truth will come out. I am not aware of any such clinical evaluation. We are under process of developing our machines.‚ÄùRefusing to comment on the purchase order, he said, ‚ÄúIf you want to know the real success of our ventilators, check with doctors that are using them.

12,['23/08/2020'],Covid-19: India's case count tops 3m; biggest spike on Sat,"NEW DELHI: India became the third country in the world to register three million Covid-19 infections, going past the grim milestone on a day when more than 70,400 fresh cases were recorded, the highest single-day count so far.

With 70,488 new cases on Saturday, India's total caseload went up to 30,40,597, as per data collated from state governments. This was the second time the daily tally in the country had crossed the 70,000 mark after 70,101 cases were reported on Wednesday.

There was a marginal dip in deaths from the virus, with 917 fatalities recorded on Saturday - the lowest in five days - taking the total Covid-19 toll to 56,764. The daily death had remained above 950 in the past four days, with the highest toll so far of 1,099 bei-ng recorded on Tuesday.

The two other countries to register more than three million coronavirus cases are the US (current tally 5.8 million) and Brazil (3.5 million).

While India has recorded the fastest rise in cases from one million to three million, the good news is that active cases in the country are lower than what the US and Brazil had at the three-million mark. The US had around 16 lakh active cases and Brazil eight lakh as compared with India‚Äôs 7.1 lakh at the same stage.

On Saturday, at least five states recorded their highest single-day spike in cases, led by Maharashtra, where 14,492 fresh infections were reported.

The other states were UP (5,375), Telangana (2,474), Gujarat 1,212 and Madhya Pradesh (1,226). The new cases in Maharashtra matched the highest single-day spike witnessed only two days ago, taking the case tally in the state to 6,71,942. After a 13-day gap, Andhra Pradesh once again reported over 10,000 new coronavirus cases in a day, pushing the tally to 3,45,216 on Saturday.

13,['23/08/2020'],Focused strategy on testing helped India contain spread,"(AFP)

NEW DELHI: The focus of India's Covid-19 testing strategy in the initial weeks of the pandemic on symptomatic foreign returnees helped detect the spreaders as more dispersed testing would have squandered limited resources and allowed many positive cases to remain undetected.

The lock down imposed as the numbers - though still low - began to double and triple in short periods of time helped slow down the incidence of the disease. The linear growth in cases remained slow through the March 24 to May 6 period by when cases climbed past the 50,000 mark. This interval helped the Centre and states significantly increase the bed capacity while doctors gained experience in dealing with the coronavirus.

""The numbers have risen considerably since unlock began but this has not overburdened the system. Specific problems relating to cities like Mumbai and Delhi and some others like Ahmedabad have been brought under control,"" said a senior government source. States that have a high case load remain a concern but higher testing has led to better identification of hot spots and containment.

The testing capacity, given India's population size, remains low but this is a hurdle that the Centre and states will have to work with, said the official, adding that containment and contact tracing were key elements to slowing down the pandemic.

The strategy seems to be paying some dividends as the positivity rate has declined from the high of 9% earlier this month and seems to stabilising though it needs to drop to 5% to meet WHO norms.

The number of labs has now touched 1,511 of which 983 are government as against just one at Pune in January.

14,['23/08/2020'],"Don‚Äôt curb transport of goods &amp; people, Centre tells states","Representative iamge

NEW DELHI: In an important direction aimed at ensuring smooth functioning of supply chains vital for the economy, the home ministry on Saturday asked states to ensure unhindered inter-state and intra-state movement of persons and goods in accordance with 'Unlock 3' guidelines issued by it on July 29 and applicable countrywide till August 31. Such curbs are a violation of the MHA guidelines, the Centre has said.

Drawing attention to the norms, home secretary Ajay Bhalla in a communication to all state chief secretaries said they clearly stipulate that no separate ""permission/approval/e-permit"" will be required for such movements, including the movement of persons and goods for cross-land border trade under treaties with neighbouring countries.

Several states continue to impose restrictions on movement of goods and even state and private transport like buses in view of the Covid situations in parts under their jurisdiction. This has been seen as a problem for supply chains and has affected availability at the retail end. It is seen as disruptive of efforts to get the economy moving after having ground to a halt during three phases of the lockdown.

‚ÄúIt has been reported that local level restrictions on movement are being imposed by various districts/states. Such restrictions are creating problems in inter-state movement of goods and services and are impacting the supply chain, resulting in disruption of economic activities and employment, besides affecting supply of goods and services,‚Äù Bhalla stated.

He said such restrictions amount to violation of MHA norms issued under Disaster Management Act, 2005.

15,['23/08/2020'],"Indian-American vote is crucial in swing states, and they‚Äôre still leaning Democrat, says US professor Karthick Ramakrishnan","While Trump and his supporters are claiming there has been a big movement of Indian-American votes to the sitting President, the latest survey in this area indicates Asian-Americans, including Indian-Americans, remain loyal to Democrats, and Kamala Harris candidacy for V-P may strengthen the support, Karthick Ramakrishnan, Professor of Political Science and Public Policy at University of California, Riverside, tells

In your recent survey of Asian-American political attitudes, where do Indian-Americans stand?

So, the whole

engagement or outreach has not moved anything?

So, there‚Äôs no sort of right-wing common cause in the two countries that has been talked about after the Howdy Modi and Namaste Trump rallies?

Didn‚Äôt this change over the years?

So, will there be a lot of support for Kamala Harris?

Do Indian-Americans gravitate towards the Republican Party as they get wealthy?

How significant is the Indian-American vote in numerical terms?

From the data and evidence that we‚Äôve seen so far, Indian-Americans still have a strong Democratic Party leaning. They have been voting Democrat as long as we‚Äôve been collecting data since 2008, and there is nothing to indicate that has changed in any significant way.Some Indian-American Trump supporters are claiming a shift in Indian-American votes towards the President by as much as 50%.We don‚Äôt know how scientific their survey is and what methodology they used. Ours is from a list of registered voters regardless of party affiliation. Based on the data we have seen it‚Äôs highly unlikely that there is a big shift. When you have a reliably solid group that votes Democratic over multiple elections, it‚Äôs very difficult to shift their opinion in the course of four years.Well, we know that US foreign policy plays a very small role in the voting decisions of Indian-Americans. It‚Äôs never been among top three or even top five issues. For most Indian-Americans, the issues that have been consistently at the top since 2008 are the economy, education, healthcare, environment, and racial discrimination. Indian-Americans are very strong supporters of universal healthcare and Trump has been trying to gut the Affordable Care Act. They are also very strong supporters of gun control and of environmental protection.Like I said, foreign relations or military ties do not play a big role in voting preferences. We should not mistake the intensity of opinion expressed by a few people on social media for voting intent. Indian-Americans like other immigrants who come to the US have only two choices ‚Äî Democrat or Republican. They have to figure out fairly early on where they belong. And this is where I think the rhetoric and the politics of the Republican Party over the last two decades has turned off a lot of Indian-Americans.Even though George W Bush was trying to portray a more friendly face of the Republican Party, things went south after 9/11. There was more racial profiling and also a rise of Christian fundamentalism within the Republican Party that made it very difficult for Indian-Americans to find a home there. After 9/11, the Democratic Party was much more likely to champion the cause of anti-discrimination than the Republican Party. You look at the trajectory of someone like Bobby Jindal, who went from someone who had a lot of admiration and support in the Indian-American community to becoming an outcast in America when he ran in 2016.I think Kamala Harris‚Äô nomination is a game-changer but it really depends on how the Democratic Party plays this. Trump can say he is a friend of India and friend of Modi, but it is not from our survey data that this translates into support for the Republican Party. With Kamala Harris there is the personal, ethnicity issue. In the early stages of her campaign there was talk that she was not emphasising her Indian-ness enough. Now you hear of posters going up in Tamil Nadu. The news coverage in India could make a difference. It will be interesting to see movement not just in terms of opinion among Indian-Americans, but also in terms of campaign contributions. Most Indian-Americans, when they run for office, run as Democrats.We don‚Äôt have large numbers from surveys of people in the very high wealth range. That said, in 2012, one of the issues we asked about was taxes on the wealthy because that‚Äôs what Obama had proposed in order to reduce the deficit. And we found support among Indian-Americans, including among those whose incomes were $250,000 or above. Indian-Americans are not self-interested in a very narrow sense. They care about the country, and more generally, they also have ideas about what is good policy.We know there are 1.8 million Indian-American eligible voters. Their votes are crucial in several swing states that Trump won by a whisker in 2016, including Michigan and Pennsylvania. High turnout will make a difference. There are states like Texas that are becoming important because some people are saying Biden has to not only win but win big to erase all doubts Trump might raise in which case Texas becomes an important piece. There are more than 160,000 Indian-American voters in Texas.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77696754,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-94588,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/all-that-matters/indian-american-vote-is-crucial-in-swing-states-and-theyre-still-leaning-democrat-says-us-professor-karthick-ramakrishnan/articleshow/77696748.cms

NEW DELHI: NEW DELHI: The armed forces say they will be forced to seek waivers for certain products in the recently-announced negative arms import list if the domestic defence production industry fails to deliver in terms of quality standards and specified timelines.

A cross-section of senior officers from the Army, Navy and IAF told TOI the negative list was ‚Äúa welcome step‚Äù to boost the indigenous defence-industrial base (DIB) but is fraught with ‚Äúa number of uncertainties‚Äù for the armed forces.

‚ÄúImplementation of the list will have to be contingent on the success of the indigenization and production process for the specified weapons and ammunition. Operational military readiness cannot be sacrificed, or compromised, at the altar of indigenization,‚Äù said a senior officer.

The over 15-lakh strong armed forces are also in the process of ‚Äúseeking clarifications‚Äù about the negative arms imports list because it broad-brushes certain categories of items. The policy, however, has been recently announced and its effects are yet to be fully evaluated in terms of what production capacities will be.

It was on August 9 that defence minister Rajnath Singh announced the acquisition of 101 weapon systems and platforms from abroad will be progressively banned from December 2020 to December 2025.

The negative list ranges from some types of ammunition, sonars, radars, artillery guns and assault rifles to missile destroyers, transport aircraft, light combat helicopters, wheeled armoured fighting vehicles and conventional diesel-electric submarines.

It does mark a significant step towards eventually getting India out of its strategically-vulnerable position of being among the world‚Äôs top two arms importers. ‚ÄúYes, foreign arms supplies can be choked in times of emergencies. They are also very expensive. But then, the Indian defence industry has a long track record of dismal performance,‚Äù said another officer.

Army vice chief Lt-General S K Saini, just a few days ago, had said his force was more than ready and willing to fight with indigenous weapon systems but they must pass stringent quality checks and adhere to delivery timelines.

Experts say it is critical to systematically augment the domestic DIB, with a sustained R&D thrust on cutting-edge weapon technologies. For one, DRDO and its 50 labs, Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) and its 41 factories, the four defence shipyards and five defence PSUs have to be drastically overhauled. For another, the private sector has to incentivized to jump into defence production in a big way.

‚ÄúOtherwise, whenever there is a national security crisis, like after the 2016 Uri terror attack or the 2019 Balakot air strikes, the armed forces have to inevitably go for emergency and fast-track imports to plug operational voids,‚Äù he added.

Contracts worth around Rs 24,000 crore were inked with countries like Russia, Israel and France after the Uri attack to build reserves for ‚Äú10 days of intense fighting‚Äù with Pakistan.

The ongoing military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh has led to yet another similar scramble. The acquisitions in the pipeline range from Spice-2000 precision-guided bombs, Spike Firefly loitering munitions, Excalibur and APFSDS (armour piercing fin stabilized discarding sabot) ammunition to Spike anti-tank guided missiles, SiG Sauer assault rifles, man-portable air defence systems and different types of drones, as was reported by TOI earlier.

The Army is particularly worried about ammunition. TOI in May last year had reported that the force had sounded the red-alert over the unacceptably high number of accidents and casualties taking place in the field due to the poor and defective quality of ammunition being supplied for tanks, artillery, air defence and other guns by the OFB.

The government, on its part, is firmly pushing ahead with the ‚Äúcorporatization‚Äù of the OFB, which includes converting it into one or more 100% government-owned public sector corporate entities, to improve its functional autonomy, public accountability and efficiency as the main supplier of arms, ammunition and clothing to the Army.

24,['23/08/2020'],BJP harps on ‚Äògood governance‚Äô in Bihar,"BJP netas at the executive committee meeting of the party on Saturday

PATNA: The state BJP on Saturday exuded confidence in its ‚Äúmost efficient, able and tested leadership‚Äù with clear vision to fight the upcoming assembly polls and promised to follow the formula of ‚Äòsabka saath, sabka vikas (everyone‚Äôs support, everyone‚Äôs development)‚Äô.

In its political resolutions adopted at the two-day executive committee meeting of the party, the saffron party said the state and central governments were committed to uplift all sections of the society and take the state to a new height of development.

Launching a scathing attack on the opposition parties in the state, the BJP said the Mahagathbandhan can‚Äôt provide a stable and development-oriented government in the state as political ideologies of its constituents were poles apart. ‚ÄúOn the other hand, the NDA partners are supportive of the development,‚Äù it claimed.

‚ÄòSabka saath, sabka vikas‚Äô and ‚Äòsamajik nyay ke saath vikas‚Äô are the two mantras, which the NDA would follow in the ensuing assembly polls scheduled to be held in October-November, the political resolutions said.

The resolutions talked about the initiatives taken by the central and the state governments to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. ‚ÄúWhile the opposition is insensitive and making baseless accusations, the governments in the state and at the Centre have left no stone unturned to check the spread of the virus,‚Äù the resolution said, revealing the recent steps taken to increase the testing facilities in the state.

Reiterating its political commitments towards the country as a whole and state in particular, the BJP said the state‚Äôs budget during the RJD regime was Rs 23,855 crore, which has now been increased to Rs 2,11,761 crore. Similarly the state‚Äôs GDP was 3.19%, which has gone up to 11.3%.

Drawing a parallel between the RJD regime and that of the NDA, the political resolution said the growth rate of the state was 2% during the RJD rule, which has increased to 8% now. ‚ÄúSimilarly, power supply has been provided to 100% households, while it was confined to only 22% households during Lalu-Rabri regime,‚Äù it said.

The resolution also highlighted the measures taken by the central and state governments to provide relief to returnee migrant workers. It covered issues related to abrogation of Article 370 , construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya, new education policy of the Union government, CAA and special economic package.

KOLKATA: The city is set to be lashed by showers, including a couple of heavy spells, that could leave streets waterlogged and push the water-level up across south Bengal rivers on Monday and Tuesday. A low-pressure area is likely to form over northwest Bay of Bengal on Monday and trigger 100mm rain in the city over the next 48 hours. According to the RMC, intermittent rain will continue in Kolkata and south Bengal on Sunday.

‚ÄúWe expect the system to intensify into a well-marked low-pressure and sail across the Bengal-Bangladesh border triggering moderate to heavy rain across south Bengal. While East and West Midnapore and Jhargram are likely to receive heavy showers, North and South 24 Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly, Nadia and Burdwan will get consistent rain on Monday and Tuesday ,‚Äù said RMC director G K Das.

Kolkata will remain cloudy during the first half of the week, added Das. ‚ÄúA spell or two of heavy rain is likely in Kolkata and could push the rain count up,‚Äù he said. The KMC has alerted its sewerage and drainage department officials, who are concerned about large areas off EM Bypass, Behala and areas adjacent to Garia as they have no underground drainage system.

In this context, the industry considers it its duty to highlight pitfalls of the proposed policy that, if implemented in the current form, will lead to a great loss to all stakeholders.‚Äù‚ÄúIt is frightening to envisage what further hiking of taxes on spirits will do to liquor sales in the state and to the government‚Äôs tax collections.

Of them, only 50% were active before Covid outbreak. However, even these units have also become inactive now,‚Äù Kumar added.Ankit, head of operations at a leading advertising startup at Patliputra Colony, said there is a paradigm shift in consumer purchase behaviour due to Covid-19. As a result, startups have to revise their market strategies in order to survive.‚ÄúThere has been a 20% decrease in our client acquisition rate over the course of the last three months. Because of market uncertainty, our potential clients have cut expenditure on advertisement. They prefer holding on to cash rather than investing it in a supporting function,‚Äù said Ankit.Alok Kumar Singh, whose Kankarbagh-based real estate startup provides co-working space to mid-sized companies, said, ‚ÄúThere is a lot of uncertainty in the market because of the lockdown. Even after a rise in the number of queries post March, our client conversation rate is not promising. Since startups don‚Äôt have big buffer of cash that they can burn for long, we are hopefully awaiting some relief measures such as tax relaxation, early reimbursement of TDS and fast loan disbursal from the state government.‚Äù‚ÄúAlso, the startup funding scenario in the state is gloomy.

BHAGALPUR: An additional RT-PCR machine is likely to be installed at Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital (JLNMCH) here for Covid testing. The existing RT-PCR machine had developed faults on Wednesday, thereby hindering Covid testing for three days. As a result, samples of suspected Covid patients piled up at the hospital.

JLNMCH principal Dr Hemant Kumar Sinha said efforts were on to get the second RT-PCR machine installed at the hospital. After the installation of the second RT-PCR machine, the number of Covid tests at the hospital will jump to more than 500 per day.

The additional RT-PCR machine was handed over to the JLNMCH by Bihar Agricultural University department (BAU) recently. Since the RT-PCR machine was earlier procured by the university for plant related researches, it needed some modifications for Covid-19 tests, said BAU sources.

The second RT-PCR machine will be able to test 280 samples per day. JLNMCH principal Dr Sinha said technical experts from Kolkata have already started the process of installing second RT-PCR machine at the hospital after certain modifications.

Referring to the first RT-PCR machine which had developed snag, Dr Sinha said the faults have been rectified and the machine has become functional now.

‚ÄúRT-PCR is one of the most accurate laboratory methods for detecting, tracking and studying Covid-19,‚Äù Dr Sinha said, adding it is a variation of polymerase chain reaction and different from the rapid antibody (serological) tests and cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test.

PATNA: Taking a jibe at the main opposition RJD‚Äôs election symbol, CM Nitish Kumar on Saturday said there is no need of ‚Äòlalten‚Äô (lantern) in Bihar as electricity connection has already been provided to each household across the state.

‚ÄúThe requirement of ‚Äòlalten‚Äô has totally ended in the state as the electricity has reached all the households in Bihar. Now, what is the utility of ‚Äòlalten‚Äô and ‚Äòdhibri‚Äô (kerosene lamp) in Bihar?‚Äù Nitish asked while speaking at an energy department event.

The CM, however, didn‚Äôt take the name of any political party.

Recalling the grim power supply scenario in Bihar before 2005 when he came to power, Nitish said, ‚ÄúBefore winning the October 2005 assembly election, I was touring different parts of the state as part of the ‚ÄòNyay Yatra‚Äô. One day when I was returning from Jehanabad and Arwal soon after the sunset, I saw total darkness throughout the route. There was no trace of electricity. Not a single person was seen on the road. I clearly recollect those frightening scenes even today.‚Äù

The CM further said everybody in the state knows very well about the electricity supply scenario in the state before 2005. ‚ÄúBut some people have the habit of making baseless statements about the state government‚Äôs work to remain in the media. Such people can say anything to get publicity,‚Äù Nitish said with reference to RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav without taking his name.

‚ÄúBut those who give publicity to such baseless statements should ask from their own heart about the situation of electricity supply in Bihar before 2005,‚Äù Nitish said.

Earlier in his speech, deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi lauded Nitish for making a complete turnaround in the power sector in Bihar.

Recalling the pre-2005 phase, Modi said generators used to create noise in all urban areas as there was no sign of power supply even in the market areas during the peak hours. ‚ÄúPower supply was so pathetic those days that generators were used even in the government offices during the working hours,‚Äù Modi said.

PATNA: Former Maharashtra CM and BJP‚Äôs incharge for Bihar elections Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday said the 2020 assembly polls would decide the fate of Bihar and indicate whether the state wants to march to a golden era or not.

Addressing a two-day virtual state executive committee meeting of the party, Fadnavis said Bihar would continue its onward journey towards development with the NDA governments in state and at the Centre.

Alleging that Bihar was pushed 25 years back during 15-year Lalu-Rabri regime, Fadnavis said the journey towards development started in Bihar with the formation of the NDA government in 2005. ‚ÄúThe NDA government in the state tried to set things right and accelerated the pace of development in the last 15 years,‚Äù he said.

Exhorting youths to come forward and lend their support for all-round development of the state, Fadnavis said 58% of the state‚Äôs population was below the age of 25 years. ‚ÄúThe support of the 58% youth is of paramount importance and will pave the way for driving the state towards the golden era,‚Äù he said.

Highlighting the main achievements of Narendra Modi government part-II at the Centre, he called upon the workers of the party to create awareness among people about development works undertaken by the central government. He also referred to abrogation of Article 370 in J&K and the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya.

In a bid to strike a chord with Bihar, the former Maharashtra CM started his speech by reciting a few lines of a poem written by Ramdhari Singh Dinkar, a Bihar-born Hindi litterateur of national repute.

He appreciated the role of the party workers in providing help to people fighting against Covid-19 pandemic and floods in the state. Fadnavis said he would visit the state on August 25-26 to chalk out strategy for the upcoming assembly elections.

Speaking on the occasion, state president of the party Dr Sanjay Jaiswal called upon the workers of the party to work hard so that the NDA could form the next government in the state.

State road construction minister Nand Kishore Yadav said the Congress, which was bestowed with the responsibility of taking the country on the development path after independence, indulged in corrupt practices. He described the alliance between the Congress and RJD as ‚Äòthagon ka bandhan‚Äô.

The meeting will conclude on Sunday. National president of the party J P Nadda will address the concluding ceremony.

A team of VDA consisting of zonal officer and junior engineer had visited the maestro‚Äôs house (CK-46/63) in Hadaha Sarai locality on August 17 for inspection. According to the VDA inspection report released on Friday, the room on the second floor was demolished by Mohammad Shiftain, the grandson of the Ustad and son of late Mehtab Hussain. Presently, Shiftain resides in the house.

It also came to light that there is a property dispute among the family members. Khan had five sons.

‚ÄúSince it is a case of a private property, the VDA team verbally and through notice directed the family members to get permission from the municipal corporation as per rule for the demolition of the building if it is in a dilapidated condition. They were also directed to get the map approved from the VDA before starting any new construction,‚Äù said VDA officials.

Days before his death anniversary on August 21, the upper floor room of the maestro‚Äôs house, where he lived and did ‚Äòriyaz‚Äô (practice), was demolished by his kin to develop the house as a commercial complex. The other members of the family raised objections to it.

Many youth organisations also raised the issue saying that it is the duty of the Central government and cultural ministry to conserve the belongings of the maestro.

In a joint press statement, the state secretary of All India Democratic Student Organisation (AIDSO) Dilip Kumar, state secretary of All India Democratic Youth Organisation (AIDYO) Makardhwaj and state secretary of All India Mahila Sanskritik Sangathan (AIMSS) Vandana Singh demanded that the Central and state governments should protect the house. ‚ÄúIt should be developed as a shehnai training centre,‚Äù they said, ‚Äúadding that the family members should be rehabilitated somewhere else and given financial assistance.‚Äù

Khan‚Äôs foster daughter and singer Soma Ghosh and former MLA and Congress leader Ajay Rai also demanded government‚Äôs intervention saying that the government should come forward to conserve his house as a museum .

39,['23/08/2020'],Minister washes hands of Gaya‚Äôs ‚Äòdirtiest‚Äô tag,"GAYA: Under attack from different quarters for Gaya being ranked the ‚Äòdirtiest‚Äô town in the less than 10 lakh population category, state agriculture minister Prem Kumar on Saturday held Gaya Municipal Corporation (GMC) responsible for bringing disrepute to the town as well as the state. Prem is an MLA from Gaya Town constituency.

Maintaining that the GMC was an independent body and the government has no role to play in its functioning, the minister said the poor ranking was on account of performance and he, as the MLA, had nothing to do with the matter.

Asked about the matter being made an election issue, he said people were aware of the facts and as such no mud would stick on him. The ranking has been purely on performance and had little to do with the Urban Development Policy of the government, said Kumar, who was earlier the urban development minister.

Offering his support to the GMC in setting things right, Kumar said it is time for all stakeholders to sit together and work for the town‚Äôs betterment.

Congress leader and Wazirganj MLA Awadhesh Kumar Singh said Prem cannot escape his share of responsibility as he has been representing the area for the last three decades. Seven wards of the GMC were parts of the Wazirganj assembly constituency.

According to Gaya watchers. it will be a major election issue. Two of the likely contestants have closely been associated with the GMC functioning. Deputy mayor Mohan Srivastav and former municipal commissioner Vijay Kumar are said to be among the serious Congress ticket aspirants for the Gaya Town seat.

Criticizing the GMC functioning, former municipal councillor from South Gaya, Asad Perwez @ Commander, said mayor Birendra Kumar has abdicated his responsibility and played second fiddle to the deputy mayor. When contacted, the mayor passed on the phone to Mohan.

Meanwhile, municipal commissioner Sawan Kumar has served show-cause notices to assistant municipal commissioner Shahab Yahya, nodal officer (sanitation) Dinkar Prasad and City Manager Vishnu Prabhakar Lal. The officers, as per the notices, did not upload the required information to the online format of the Swachhta Survey, thereby causing deep drop in the town‚Äôs ranking.

40,['23/08/2020'],Art sector paints canvas differently to stay afloat during pandemic,"One of the artwork that will be exhibited at the gallery

Vadodara: Like many other sectors, Covid-19 pandemic has created a dent in the art industry that thrives on the physical and aesthetic experience of art lovers. The pandemic has thrown new challenges which even the well-established artists are struggling to battle.

But in this era, art galleries and independent artists are trying to make a difference by helping young artists stay afloat in the market- by embracing virtual world, making art affordable and searching for new buyers.

A city-based art gallery has been putting spotlight on young artists annually through its exhibition ‚Äì ‚ÄòEmbark‚Äô that provides a platform to young graduates of M S University‚Äôs famed Faculty of Fine Arts.

‚ÄúHosting a physical exhibition in the current scenario is nearly impossible. So, we started hosting the third edition ‚Äì Embark III ‚Äì entirely digitally through an online viewing room from August 1,‚Äù said its director Nupur Dalmia.

The art works were priced affordably with most of them under Rs 10,000 to encourage younger and first-time collectors. ‚ÄúAt the same time, as a commitment to supporting the young talent pool, we did not take any commission this year and 100 % of the proceeds were directly given to the artists,‚Äù she said.

The gallery has decided to continue supporting artists and offering ‚Äúaffordable art‚Äù with its next show in which all the artworks by its permanent artist roster - Teja Gavankar, Deepak Agastya, Mrugen Rathod and Vimal Ambaliya - will be priced under Rs 30,000.

‚ÄúDuring the lockdown, all sectors got hit but the art sector took the biggest hit because of the common sentiment that art is a luxury. In March itself art professionals from more than ten countries had joined hands to form Art Circle International (ACI),‚Äù said Sachin Kaluskar, an art curator.

ACI launched its first virtual art exhibition ‚Äì ‚ÄòTogetherness‚Äô ‚Äì on August 19 exhibiting works of 50 plus artists from ten countries including India, United Kingdom, United States, Italy, Malaysia, Poland, Hong Kong, Mexico, Nigeria and Uganda showcasing artworks in a variety of mediums, genres and styles.

‚ÄúThe proceeds will go directly to the participating artist,‚Äù said Kaluskar, one of the six international curators who along with Kannan Asher and Maharishi Panchal, coordinated with artists.

Delhi-based artists duo - Ayesha Singh and Purvi Rai - have created Art-Chain India, an Instagram movement where artists can upload pictures of any work of art priced under Rs 10,000 with #ArtChainIndia. Once they sell work worth Rs 50,000, they pledge to spend Rs 10,000 on the work of another artist.

Inspired by her success story, the Pama institute for the advancement of trans-disciplinary archaeological sciences has offered Payal a two-month residential fellowship aimed to equip her for higher studies.

‚ÄúPayal scored 95% marks for her Plus Two and we were surprised when she opted for Module2 archaeology and history because we usually get only students who don‚Äôt gain admission for other courses.

This has posed a serious health problem for a vast populace. The government had assured the people of these panchayats that they would get potable water free from contaminants by the end of 2020. However, experts have serious doubts about the efficiency of the state machinery in achieving the target.

Bihar State Pollution Control Board chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh told this newspaper, ‚ÄúEven if the work on supplying pure drinking water in the affected areas is in progress, it is unlikely to be completed soon. Ensuring supply of potable water to millions of people in different districts is a challenge.‚Äù

Environmentalist Mehta Nagendra Singh pointed out that a majority of the people residing in different parts of the state continued to get water contaminated with various toxic substances like arsenic, fluoride and iron.

‚ÄúDrinking contaminated water amid the Covid-19 pandemic is more dangerous,‚Äù he said.

However, PHED minister Vinod Narain Jha claimed that the residents of most wards affected by fluoride and arsenic contamination had started getting clean water .

‚ÄúWork in the remaining areas is in progress and will be completed soon. Tenders for supply of iron-free water have also been floated,‚Äù the minister said, adding that there were altogether 110 water quality-testing labs in 38 districts of the state.

He also urged the people to get the quality of water checked at the laboratories for free.

Anup had lodged an FIR with the Town police station against Guddu and his younger brother Rinku Singh. Incidentally, the JD(U) party office of Gopalganj is located just above the hospital floor.

Police sources said at least a dozen rounds were fired on the hospital building. There were bullet marks on its windows and walls. However, no one was injured in the incident.

‚ÄúGuddu had threatened Anup at least four times in the past to get his hospital shifted to some other locality,‚Äù the SHO said.

LUCKNOW: Joining the issue over raging politics over Brahmins in the state and taking a dig at the Opposition for 'suddenly developing an affinity for Lord Parshuram', Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that there was no difference between Ram and Parshuram. ""Both Ram and Parshuram are incarnations of Lord Vishnu. The difference is in just some people's mind,"" he said while speaking on the floor of the house on the last day of monsoon session.

Both SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and BSP president Mayawati had recently said that they would install idols of Parshuram and the foundation of Ram temple was laid in Ayodhya.

Yogi quoted three couplets from Ramcharitmanas to show the kind of respect Ram and Parshuram had for each other. ""But some people indulge in dirty politics by harping on the difference between the two.""

The CM's speech was perceived as a swift damage control by the BJP to placate Barahmins, who are being openly wooed by all opposition parties.

Even a BJP MLA from Sultanpur has recently questioned his own government about the steps being taken for the protection of Brahmins.

Attacking the Samajwadi Party without naming it, he said ‚Äúevery body knew a Brahmin youth was beheaded in Kannauj"". Similarly, he reminded the BSP about the slogan ‚Äútilak, taraju aur talwar‚Ä¶,‚Äù coined by its idologue, Kanshi Ram. ""How can these party claim to get support of the Brahmins when they had perpetrated so much atrocities and injustices upon them,‚Äù he asked.

52,['23/08/2020'],Discoms facing difficulty in recovery of dues of lockdown,"Jaipur: The power department, which had allowed deferment of bills during lockdown, is facing a major challenge in recovering due amounts. The dues were to be paid in two instalments with the current bills after lockdown was lifted, but consumers have been demanding waiver of bills for two months claiming that they were not in a position to clear it.

Bills of consumers using more than 150 units per month were deferred during lockdown.

The BJP, meanwhile, has demanded that power bills for two months be waived and made it a political issue.

The chief minister at a review meeting of the power department directed the officials to look into the grievances of the public and address them.

‚ÄúSince spot billing was disrupted from March due to Covid and lockdown, the consumers were not used to the new rate. Consumers are now feeling the pinch with the new rate while their income took a hit due to Covid restrictions,‚Äù said a senior official.

Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission in February hiked power tariff for different categories of consumers by up to 11 per cent, a move in which an additional annual revenue of nearly Rs 4,800 crore for power utilities in the state.

The chief minister also directed the discoms to shift power lines passing near residential houses. The live wires passing close to houses are a cause of accidents, but discoms have been refusing to shift them without the residential welfare associations bearing 50% of the cost. The discoms were also arguing that in many colonies people made houses close to the lines violating norms. The chief minister now asked the discoms to bear full cost of shifting such lines.

President Ashwin Mehadia, secretary Ramawtar Totla and vice-president Sanjay Agrawal said that the recent order issued by municipal commissioner mandating every shop/office to obtain trade licence from NMC not only lacks jurisdiction but also is in violation of procedure prescribed under the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation (MMC) Act, 1949.

Commissioner without following the provisions to make, add, alter or rescind the rules, regulations and by-laws by Corporation has directly issued the trade license order, they said.

Agrawal further said that the Section 376 of the MMC Act, under which the order is claimed to be issued, in unequivocal terms states that only specified things, trades and operations as specified in rules can be asked to obtain a licence.

‚ÄúThe list of goods, trades and operations which can be regulated by commissioner are mentioned in Chapter XVIII of Schedule-D of the MMC Act. The Act doesn‚Äôt empower the commissioner to control the goods, trades and operations not mentioned in the said chapter,‚Äù he said.

54,['23/08/2020'],Food is best medicine for asymptomatic Covid +ves,"Nagpur: With thousands of asymptomatic Covid-19 patients under home isolation in city, lifestyle changes and diet has become an important part for all of them. TOI spoke to doctors and dieticians who shared valuable tips for the patients in home isolation.

‚ÄúHome isolation is allowed to those asymptomatic patients who don‚Äôt have any immune compromised status lke HIV, transplant recipients, cancer therapy etc. Most patients in home isolation in Nagpur city are young. They need to maintain their health parameters and keep themselves fit by staying at home. Secondly, they must ensure that they are not spreading the infection to any other individual,‚Äù said Dr Nirmal Jaiswal, critical care specialist and member of Nagpur Covid Task Force.

Asymptomatic patients hardly need to take any specific medicine or drugs. So, they have to rely on good diet to be fit and maintain immunity. Clinical dietitian Malvika Fulwani said body gets all required energy and vital nutrients to form defense against invading coronavirus from food only.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important for both symptomatic as well as asymptomatic Covid-19 patients to have proper diet and rest to fight the virus,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe believe that nutrition is the only remedy that can bring full recovery and can be used with any treatment. So, good food is a best medicine,‚Äù she added.

Dieticians have also suggested some food changes for such patients. Garlic is known to have immune-enhancing effects which maybe, in part, responsible for reduced severity. Vitamin C is an antioxidant which contributes to immune defense by supporting various cellular functions. So, having vitamin C is beneficial to fight the virus.

Green vegetables such as spinach, fenugreek, broccoli etc are packed with phytonutrients that our immune system needs for optimal function. They are also rich in folate which is important for producing antibodies.

Beans are also important part of Covid diet. ‚ÄúSeventy per cent of our immunity lies in digestive system. Beans along with peas and lentils are rich sources of resistant starch which helps enhance gut microbiome thereby boosting immunity,‚Äù said Malvika.

Onion also known to have immune-boosting benefits while nuts and seeds like chia seeds, flax seeds, walnuts, almonds are rich in disease-preventing nutrients like omega-3 fats and micronutrients like vitamin E, zinc and calcium.

Studies have shown that people with vitamin D deficiency are 11 times more likely to get viral infections so it is very important to include this sunshine vitamin in our diet. It is naturally made by our skin when exposed to direct ultraviolet light.

TRIPUNITHURA/KOCHI: Onam festivities in two sides of the city ‚Äî Tripunithura and Thrikkakara ‚Äî have been toned down in the wake of Covid-19. The Atham procession and the Vamanamoorthy temple festival which began on Saturday were curtailed to conducting rituals, without the public display and celebrations.

At the Thrikkakara temple, the ten-day Onam festivities will be restricted to temple rituals only. ‚ÄúWe have not had to restrict festivities in several decades, from the time the temple became part of the Travancore devaswom,‚Äù said temple committee secretary Pramod Kumar. ‚ÄúMore devotees have been turning up to offer prayers, compared to the previous days. However, we have all the Covid protocols in place,‚Äù he added.

Atham 2020, which is the traditional beginning of ten-day long state-level Onam celebrations, was confined to just a flag hoisting. On Friday, S Anujan Thampuran, representing Kochi Royal family, handed over the flag to municipal chairperson Chandrika Devi.

Tripunithura MLA M Swaraj hoisted the flag at Atham Nagar at 9am on Saturday. Municipal chairperson Chandrika Devi, vice-chairman O V Salim and a few councillors participated in the flag hoisting. This is the second time in three years that the Atham procession has been cancelled. In 2018, the celebrations were cancelled due to heavy rain which was followed by flooding.

‚ÄúUntil the merging of erstwhile Kochi state with Indian Union in 1950, there was no break for royal Athachamayam till 1949, when Rama Varma Pareekshith Thampuran, the last Kochi King, headed the Athachamayam from Hill Palace,‚Äù recalled Anujan Thampuran.

‚ÄúSince Athachamayam was not a religious ceremony, Kochi Kings participated in it. Actually, the Athachamayam procession used to start from Hill Palace around 100 years ago,‚Äù said Rameshan Thampuran of Bungalow Palace .

As per records Hill Palace was built during the royal reign of the Kochi King Maharaja Rama Varma (popularly known as the Kochi King who passed away in Madras) who ruled the State from 1914-32. Till then the Athachamayam started from various palaces in Tripunithura like Kalikottta Palace or Puthen Bungalow, Rameshan says.

JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot laid the foundation stone for 25 projects via video conferencing on Saturday which will be developed by the Rajasthan Housing Board (RHB) in the state. These projects include 14 housing schemes , four affordable housing schemes, city park (Jaipur), coaching hub and others.

Appreciating the efforts, Gehlot said the board which was lying defunct during the tenure of previous BJP government, is now playing a crucial role in systematic development.

Gehlot said, ‚ÄúThe previous government was seeing the RHB as a white elephant and planned to close it. However, the spirit of employees has given a new lease of life to the board. It is not only working in direction to provide roof to poor and others, but also developing infrastructural projects,‚Äù he said.

In Jaipur, two major projects such as city park and coaching hub will be developed.

An official said, the RHB will develop the city park on around 52 acre in Mansarovar area which is expected to benefit more than 50 colonies. The board plans to plant 21,000 trees of 32 different species in the area. The jogging track will be 3.5-km long, slightly shorter than Central Park. However, the size of the park is claimed to be bigger the Central Park which is 42 acres, he said.

Around 75% area of the earmarked land will be developed as green. The project has parking for 799 cars and 325 two-wheelers. The main entrance plaza of the park will be constructed at Madhyam Marg end.

The park will have three other gates which will open on Aravali Marg , V T Road and New Sanganer Road. Similarly, the board will develop a coaching hub in Pratap Nagar of the city which would accommodate nearly 70,000 students.

An official said, ‚ÄúThe estimated cost of the project will be Rs 231 crore. Construction will be done only on 40% of the earmarked land and 60% land will remain open.‚Äù

As per the plan, there are eight education towers proposed in the project. Construction of five towers will be undertaken in phase-1 and the remaining three towers will be developed in phase-II.

While the youth was found hanging, the deceased woman was found lying on the bed. Police are yet to unravel the motive behind the alleged suicide and murder case . However, they suspect it to be a case of relationship gone wrong.

The deceased have been identified as Sanjay Meena and Maya Meena , both in their mid-20s.

Shiv Dayal, SHO, Sanganer police station, said ‚ÄúWhile Sanjay was found hanging from the fan, Maya lay dead on the bed when we found them. Prima facie , it seems that Sanjay first killed Maya by apparently strangling her and then committing suicide himself.‚Äù

The bodies were found at Maya‚Äôs rented accommodation where she stayed while preparing for competitive examinations. Sanjay stayed in another rented room around a few kilometre away.

While police found no suicide note, the preliminary investigation indicates that the duo was in a relationship. The SHO said, ‚ÄúEither, the two had a suicide pact possibly because of non-acceptance of their relationship or they had an altercation because of which Sanjay killed Maya. While the cause of her death will be confirmed after post-mortem, we are almost certain that she died because of strangulation.‚Äù

66,['23/08/2020'],Delhi: How it‚Äôs virtually back to school for teachers,"NEW DELHI: Neelam Gupta has taught commerce in a Delhi University college for 28 years. After all these years of lugging her books and teaching materials and commuting for three hours, the 53-year-old suddenly found herself relearning everything about teaching. Her schedule starts later in the morning now because she doesn‚Äôt have to travel, and her accessories are a newly purchased laptop, digital pen and various software, the use of which she learnt from her son and friends.Gupta, who teaches at BR Ambedkar College , misses the physical classes, but isn‚Äôt unhappy about more youngsters telling her that they have no problems comprehending the lessons, which leaves her fully contented.Like Gupta, university teachers are adapting to post-Covid-19 education with classes for second- and third-year students under way in online mode. They are taking tech tips from each other and their colleges have also conducted workshops for them. Now, many are going the extra mile to make lessons more immersive by integrating quizzes, virtual labs and interactive sessions.‚ÄúWhen the pandemic broke out, we had no access to online materials or books. I wrote on a whiteboard and my son took photos to use on YouTube,‚Äù Gupta recalled. ‚ÄúWhen the lockdown eased, we bought a laptop and this has proved a great help. Friends and colleagues also assisted me because these technologies were something I had never used earlier in life.‚Äù Having a podcast enthusiast for a son was a bonus.Amrita Bajaj, assistant professor of geography at Shaheed Bhagat Singh College, spends some time in the college library after her online lectures. ‚ÄúStudents do not have access to reading materials, so I get them scanned and mail them,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúGeography requires explanatory drawings. I send scanned diagrams to the students and ask them to have it handy during the online class.‚ÄùBajaj, however, yearns for the actual classes because unlike in a school, where teaching is prescriptive, ‚Äúin college, a lot of learning takes place through interaction‚Äù. This exchange of views in class is what is missed by many teachers.Zoom, Google Meet and Microsoft Teams are the buzzwords in the teaching community. These being new platforms, Siddharth Rathore, assistant professor of economics in Gargi College, started a YouTube channel called The Pink Professor to explain how these operate. Some others, like Gurpreet Singh Tuteja, share tips on teaching online. Tuteja, mathematics teacher at Zakir Hussain College, conducted a course with teachers at Hansraj College on how mathematics can be taught online. ‚ÄúI introduced to the teachers and students an open-source software, and covered many applications in calculus, linear algebra and other concepts,‚Äù revealed Tuteja.Likewise, Amit Jain, physics professor at Rajdhani College , has incorporated virtual laboratories for his students to make up for practicals. ‚ÄúDU is looking to promote online practicals through virtual laboratories, but I have been using them for some time now,‚Äù claimed Jain. ‚ÄúThese labs are essential tools for providing simulated experiments for students and give them an experience that is nearly identical to a physical lab.‚ÄùThe week-long training for teachers at Ambedkar University Delhi was welcomed by the staff. ""We did upload readings on Google classrooms before the pandemic, but when it came to online teaching, we had to learn newer ways,‚Äù admitted Rachna Mehra, assistant professor of global affairs. Her colleague, Bidhan Chandra Das, added that they received training on the use of a software through which ‚Äúwe can enter class assignments, add readings and assess student data on one platform‚Äù.Das also disclosed there was some resistance from the older teachers to the new technologies, but ‚Äúwe were able to make them understand why we needed to use modern methods‚Äù.Students themselves feel that online teaching boosts learning. ‚ÄúIt allows us to go back and sit through the video recordings of the classes again,‚Äù pointed out Sparsh Singh, a BTech student at DU‚Äôs Cluster Innovation Centre. ‚ÄúWhile we have fewer classes than earlier, we manage to learn more.‚ÄùBut it‚Äôs not as if everyone has taken to online education like duck to water. While the new means increased workload and pressure for teachers, many students are struggling because they do not have laptops or smart devices. Attendance is still thin.There are also some, like Yuvaan in a village in West Bengal, for whom being a part of the classes is a challenge. ‚ÄúIt has been raining incessantly here, so net access is patchy,‚Äù the youngster said. ‚ÄúI have only been concentrating on reading materials sent to our class WhatsApp group.‚Äù",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77716685,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-541736,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-its-virtually-back-to-school-for-teachers/articleshow/77709534.cms
67,['23/08/2020'],Coaching centres witness sharp drop in outstation admissions,"Nagpur: Coaching classes across the city have witnessed a sharp drop in garnering outstation students even though online classes are being held regularly. The drop in admissions varies greatly from institute to institute, but for some there has been a fall of over 90%. On an average, the bigger institutes have witnessed a 75% drop in outstation admissions.

Students from nearby districts would flock to Nagpur for undergoing JEE/NEET coaching, but due to lockdown this has not happened. ‚ÄúEven introduction of online classes have not been able to bring back as many students,‚Äù said Rajnikanth Bondre, president of Association of Coaching Institutes. ‚ÄúReason mainly for that is poor net connectivity in non-urban areas. The feedback we are getting is that parents want to wait till the vaccine is out before confirming admissions,‚Äù said Bondre.

Sameer Pale, treasurer of ACI said that parents, too, are aware that this is a temporary phase. ‚ÄúHolding back on online classes is also because parents know that eventually offline classes will resume,‚Äù said Pale. He added that less that a quarter of outstation admissions have been wrapped up in the well known institutes.

But outstation students are apparently not enrolling in their local institutes either for online classes or committing to join whenever offline classes resume. Outside the city too, things are not looking good for coaching institutes. Shegaon‚Äôs coaching institute owner Yogesh Sharma said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a gloomy situation for all. Less than 10% admissions as compared to last year are getting confirmed. The apathy towards online classes is not only related to technical issues, but also economics.‚Äù He elaborated that buying a separate set up, topping up data etc is a cost which has to be spent upfront. ‚ÄúThis on top of the coaching institute fee is obviously something parents are not convinced about,‚Äù said Sharma.

The doctor consultation fee that hospitals charge from patients, however, has been doubled.‚ÄúWe cannot take an abrupt decision on bed charges. But we are telling hospitals to stick to the bed charges that existed in March for all beds, including ICU, ICCU and ITU, including for Covid patients,‚Äù said Justice Ashim Kumar Banerjee, the chairman of WBCERC.The commission members met on Saturday to discuss various issues on Covid treatment cost and management of patients. The commission felt that bed charges, along with medicine and investigative tests, are three main elements that push up hospital bills. Hospitals have been asked to offer a discount of 10% and 20% on medicine and consumables, respectively. Else, they should allow patients‚Äô relatives to procure them from outside, the commission has advised. Moreover, while directing hospitals not to turn away any patient if s/he is unable to pay the deposit amount, the health panel has revised the doctor fee from Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,000 per day per critical patient.‚ÄúIt is a regular practice for hospitals to review its charges, including for beds, every financial year and implement the tariff by April 1. So increased bed rates do not have anything to do with Covid-19 . However, we will be meeting on Monday and honour the commission‚Äôs advisory because this is an extraordinary situation,‚Äù said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra.Private hospitals review their services charges yearly and accordingly, bed charges are increased by 5% to 10% every year. This time, the review coincided with the pandemic. Hospitals are expected to receive the commission‚Äôs advisory by Sunday.‚ÄúWe welcome this move and are ready to abide by the advisory to extend whatever help to the common people. But we need some time for internal discussion. We also seek more clarity from the commission before we start implementing it,‚Äù said Rupak Barua, group CEO of AMRI Hospitals.‚ÄúBut bed rates have not been increased for Covid treatment. All clinical establishment reviews charge every year, factoring in inflation. Like every year, this year it came into effect from April 1,‚Äù added Barua.The commission is also likely to issue a fresh advisory on deposit amounts that hospitals can take from patients. On August 8, the commission issued an advisory that said hospitals can charge Rs 50,000 or 20% of the estimated cost of treatment from patients. And if the patient is unable to pay the amount within 12 hours, hospitals could ask the family to take the patient back. This last clause of this advisory had drawn criticism from different quarters. ‚ÄúNo hospital should turn away or stop treatment for treatment for want of money,‚Äù Banerjee said on Saturday.This apart, the commission is expected to come out with its pathological guideline for Covid-19 treatment in the next few days. ‚ÄúThe expert medical team has submitted a report on this pathological guideline,‚Äù said Banerjee.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77699237,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1291435,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/panel-fixes-bed-charges-for-covid-patients-at-pre-pandemic-rate/articleshow/77697663.cms

Prima facie, the video has evidence that the ASI posted at Sarai Amanat Khan police station was consuming the drug with the help of a lighter and a silver foil, an official release issued on Saturday said.

It said that the chief minister felt that retention and continuation of ASI Jorawar Singh in the service would be detrimental to the interests of the state, police force and the general public at large. Therefore, the dismissal was necessary to send a strong message that the state government would not tolerate such criminal acts, it stated.

Taking a serious note of the viral video, also reported by a section of the media on Friday, the chief minister had during his #AskCaptain Facebook Live session announced his decision to dismiss the ASI after an inquiry.

Not only was the dismissal essential to prevent erosion of the police and government image in the eye of the citizens, but also for the success of the anti-drugs fight of the Captain Amarinder-led government, which had declared zero-tolerance to drugs immediately after taking over the state‚Äôs reins, the release added.

KOCHI: The hunger-strike protest by the residents of Chellanam against the delay in implementing a permanent solution to the sea erosion and flooding in the coastal hamlet has completed 300 days on Saturday. To mark this, hundreds of residents including women and children under the banner of Chellanam Janakiya Vedi staged different kinds of protests.

While most of the residents observed hunger strike at their houses, many others gathered at beach and stood under the sun for two hours to create a human seawall. A few others entered the sea and stood there for hours holding placards. Though there was a plan initially to conduct a march on the road, it was later dropped after police did not give permission in the wake of the pandemic.

V T Sebastian, one of the patrons of the Janakiya Vedi , held his protest by fetching out seawater in a pot to symbolically say that he tried ‚Äúto dry up the sea to prevent erosion as government does nothing to stop it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOur protest has been ignored by the authorities but we will not stop until a solution is given by the government. We have been adhering to Covid-19 protocols and lockdown restrictions by conducting the protest from our homes with the hope that the authorities will complete the geotube works before the monsoons started as promised. But the promises still remain mere promises. We are not worried about the legal repercussions of our protest because our lives are at stake,‚Äù said Chellanam Janakiya Vedi convener Joseph Arakkal.

The residents also said that constructing breakwaters or installing interlocking tetrapod barriers will be the ideal solution to the sea erosion and it was said to be in the plan while constructing Chellanam harbour. ‚ÄúThe harbour has changed the course of waves and now we bear the brunt of the sea.

75,['23/08/2020'],Marthoma Church head bats for rights of Jacobites,"KOCHI: Joseph Mar Thoma , the metropolitan of the Marthoma Syrian Church has written to the metropolitan trustee of Jacobite Syrian Church ‚Äòexpressing his personal solidarity in the pain of the Jacobites and the assurance of the Malankara Mar Thoma Church for further guidance‚Äô.

The letter dated August 20 was released by the Jacobite Church and it is addressed to the metropolitan trustee of the Jacobite Church, Joseph Mar Gregorios.

‚ÄúI believe God will not hear the prayers offered by a minority who are willing to use the authorities to recruit the army to take over Kothamangalam Church over the rights of a majority, who consider the church as a sacred place of the Antiochian Bava. The ecumenism in India considers these events as shameful to the Christian faith and the cause for which Christ died. But the risen Lord is our hope. To consider a rule, a law or tradition, or even Constitution literally by its letter kills it, but to move with the spirit of the same is regenerative,‚Äù Dr Joseph Mar Thoma wrote in his letter.

The support comes at a time when the Jacobite faction is losing ground as major churches, including Piravom Valiyapalli and Mulanthuruthy Marthoman Cathedral were taken away from them. The letter should also be seen in the backdrop of the Synod of Jacobite Church recently deciding to increase their affinity towards Marthoma Church and to cut sacramental ties with Orthodox Church.

The strongly worded letter begins with a reference to the incident at Mulanthuruthy church.

‚ÄúThe events on Monday early morning, the police breaking open the gates and doors of the Church, entering when people were asleep, dragging the bishops who were in the church, reminds me of what had happened on a Friday morning when Jesus was back after praying in much agony that ‚ÄòThy will be done‚Äô. By evening the dazzling white robes of Jesus had turned red. Likewise, lakhs of people and families were dragged along the streets with no provisions being made by the government to worship according to their faith. Democracy cannot accept this injustice, even though some people say that this is justice,‚Äù the letter states.

The prelate added that three thousand families who constructed the church and worshiped there for centuries were thrown to the streets while less than two hundred families who were defiant and did not follow the centuries-old faith that was practised in that place are being given possession of that property.

‚ÄúI think it is not acceptable to basic democratic principles ‚Äî a minority enjoys what the majority has contributed. This kind of tendency prevails even in the church.‚Äù the letter reads.

The VC began his letter by terming August 17 as a ‚Äúred letter day‚Äù for ‚Äúhypocrites‚Äù whose avowed love for Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore and his Santiniketan ‚Äúmanifested itself in a power trip full of vandalism‚Äù.

Datta, a National Green Tribunal-nominated watchdog for Santiniketan‚Äôs environment, said: ‚ÄúNowhere did NGT mention of raising a wall around the Pous Mela ground. Visva-Bharati, in its affidavit following my arguments in NGT, gave an undertaking to demarcate and barricade the mela ground.‚Äù

The VC cited instances since Tagore‚Äôs days when VB had raised walls on campus. ‚ÄúLet me remind that China Bhavan was encircled by a wall for security of students back when Gurudev Tagore was very much on the scene,‚Äù he wrote.

Chakrabarty said Ashram Math ‚Äî a huge playground within the Santiniketan ashram ‚Äî was fenced off with a ‚Äúland mat‚Äù earlier and barricaded with a wall/fencing in 2011-12. ‚ÄúPous Mela began here 20 years after Gurudev Tagore‚Äôs death,‚Äù he said, adding that VB‚Äôs bid to raise the wall was part of an ‚Äúongoing process‚Äù following CAG‚Äôs special security observations.

Datta, however, drew a line between a court directive and a proposal put forward during a hearing on which the court puts its seal of agreement. ‚ÄúVisva-Bharati in its affidavit had proposed to barricade the mela ground. Barricading a place is of temporary nature like it happens during Nabanna or Lalbazar Abhiyan. Police put up barricades to prevent thousands of people from entering the state secretariat or police headquarters. A barricade and raising a wall/fencing is not the same thing,‚Äù he said.

NGT had nominated three members, namely West Bengal Pollution Control Board chairman Kalyan Rudra, former state advocate general Jayanta Mitra and green activist Datta to oversee environmental matters in Santiniketan based on VB‚Äôs proposal.

Datta said he was opposed to raising permanent structures on campus though he had nothing against VB constructing outer boundary walls to demarcate the campus from the rest of Santiniketan. ‚ÄúSantiniketan, and Visva-Bharati in particular, has an undulating landscape. Structures put up here and there within the campus might affect the natural slope of the undulating land and biodiversity. No one opposed the university‚Äôs building a wall at Ratan Pally or at Deer Park,‚Äù he said.

Datta turned to NGT‚Äôs order on August 19 directing both the state government and Centre to set up a waste management plan for Santiniketan within a year. ‚ÄúThe environmental problems on the mela ground ‚Äî littering of plastic and others ‚Äî are only symptoms of a bigger environmental malaise afflicting Santiniketan,‚Äù he said.

In a release issued on Saturday, SFJ‚Äôs Gurpatwant Singh Pannu has tried to lure people into offering such arads at Akal Takht by offering $5,000, and $500 for offering ardas at other local gurdwaras.

After having failed to garner support for his secessionist movement ‚ÄòReferendum 2020‚Äô in Punjab, Pannu had begun offering cash awards to the gullible people to indulge into illegal activities, without making clear possible consequences.

In recent past, he had offered $200 for removing Indian tricolor and raise Khalistan flag instead at gram panchayat on August 14, the Independence Day.

Earlier, ahead of July 26 ‚Äúvoter registration‚Äù drive, announced by SFJ, he offered Rs 2,000 to every Covid-19 patient in Jammu and Kashmir. Pannu had announced to pay Rs 5,000 more than the salary to anyone who refused to join the Indian Army or any Sikh soldier who would quits the Army. Like his all other such announcements, there were no takers for this either.

In April, Pannu had announced to increase the humanitarian aid amount from Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000 for Covid19 patients in Punjab.

‚ÄúHe is not helping anyone. He is only exploiting poverty since he has failed to exploit sentiments of people here. There is no example of anyone getting any money after his announcements,‚Äù said intelligence agencies sources here, adding that anyone keeping in touch with SFJ and helping it fulfil its nefarious designs in Punjab would be on their radar and dealt with accordingly.

VARANASI: Dr JP Tripathi (55), a senior consultant at divisional hospital of Mirzapur district, went missing mysteriously after leaving his car to respond to nature‚Äôs call near Bhatauli bridge under Dehat Kotwali police station in Mirzapur on Saturday morning.

Mirzapur SP Ajay Singh, who camped at the incident site to monitor search operations on Saturday afternoon, said that while alert has been sounded across the district to search him, teams of NDRF and divers had also been engaged in the Ganga. Despite all these efforts, Tripathi was nowhere to be found till late evening.

Police said, Tripathi had left his home in Varanasi to reach Mirzapur divisional hospital.

When the car reached near Bhatauli bridge, Tripathi asked his driver to stop the vehicle as he had to go to urinate. However, when he did not return even after 15 minutes, the driver started looking for him, but to no avail.

He then called Tripathi‚Äôs wife Dr Sunanda, who is employed at HB Cancer Hospital Lehartara, and reported the matter. Tripathi‚Äôs son is also a medical practitioner. Mirzapur SP said that after Dr Sunanda alerted Mirzapur police, the search operation was immediately launched.

Tripathi was initially posted in Basti as a medical officer, and he had joined Mirzapur divisional hospital in July.

Tripathi‚Äôs driver told his family members that he was upset over providing consultation to patients amid the Covid-19 pandemic, as many suspected cases also visited him.

The motorboat of UP Bridge Corporation was also engaged while over five divers continued searching him in the Ganga. A large number of locals remained at the site till late evening to watch the search operation.

BAREILLY: Police have sealed a private hospital under the Asmoli police jurisdiction in Sambhal and started searching for absconding staff after the family members of a woman, who had delivered a stillborn, alleged medical negligence.

According to the family members, the woman went into labour on Friday and was admitted at Sabina Nursing Home in Sambhal. However, the staff refused to treat her and referred her to another hospital.

‚ÄúWe completed all the hospital formalities and soon after my sister Munni Bai (26) went into labour, her condition deteriorated. Instead of treating her, the hospital asked us to take her to some other facility. We then took her to another hospital in Joya, Amroha, where she delivered a dead child ,‚Äù the woman‚Äôs brother, Sunil Kumar, alleged.

When they decided to confront the nursing home staff in Sambhal, they found the facility locked and staff absconded.

‚ÄúThis irresponsible behaviour of that nursing home led to the death of the child,‚Äù Kumar said.

Meanwhile, police have registered an FIR against the nursing home staff under section 316 (causing death of quick unborn child by act amounting to culpable homicide) of IPC.

‚ÄúThe hospital staff is absconding ever since the incident came to light. The hospital premises have been sealed and further legal action will be initiated in the case,‚Äù Asmoli SHO Ranvir Singh told TOI.

They had lower than the mandated content of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol (ethyl alcohol); it was less than 65%.What has worried the FDCA is the suspected use of spent industrial solvents procured as waste from pharma or chemical manufacturing plants in Bharuch or Ankleshwar and later packaged as sanitizers. Two such instances have already come into notice of the FDCA in the recent raids at a Sarkhej and Palanpur.‚ÄúOur worst fear is the use of additives like methanol in the manufacturing of fake sanitizers,‚Äù said a senior health department official. ‚ÄúThese can damage organs or our endocrine system and cause serious health issues once absorbed by our skin.‚ÄùThe official also pointed out that today consumers have to buy sanitizers that aren‚Äôt familiar brands.

The examination is scheduled for Sunday.

HC‚Äôs Justice Anupinder Singh Grewal dismissed the petition after hearing the reply of the Haryana government that elaborate arrangements have been made by the Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) to contain the spread of Covid-19 during the examination. Haryana advocate general Baldev Raj Mahajan gave complete details about the steps taken by the state authorities in various districts to ensure the infection does not spread due to the examination on Sunday. Mahajan also told the court that the examination was being done in compliance of the Supreme Court order that had asked the state to complete the selection procedure within five months.

A detailed affidavit was also filed by the HSSC on Friday, informing the HC that there are around 9,500 applicants who are going to appear for written examination and the commission had arranged 95 centres in five districts of Hisar, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Panipat and Kaithal. It submitted that apart from maintaining social distancing while entering the examination centres, they had ensured that one examination centre did not have more than 100 candidates whereas the minimum seating capacity of a school 240 to 600 candidates.

HC was also informed that in view of the Covid-19 situation, the commission had kept two schools as reserve in each district so as to meet any sudden exigencies on account of any centre being situated in contained zone. The candidates having symptoms of fever, cough, cold should be made to sit in a separate room, HC was told.

After hearing the reply and the contentions made by AG, the HC refused to interfere in the matter and dismissed the petition.

The matter had reached before the HC in the wake of a petition filed by Rekha Rani and several other candidates who had applied for the post of PTI seeking directions for quashing the notice issued by the HSSC on July 30 through which the state had decided to conduct written examination for the post of PTI during pandemic.

It was also argued that some of the petitioners were Covid-19 positive and kept in isolation by the administration and they were not in a position to appear for examination scheduled to be held on August 23. Directions were sought to defer the examination till the pandemic is over.

On April 2, the SC had upheld the decision of the Punjab and Haryana high court passed in September 2013 setting aside the appointment of 1983 PTIs selected through the HSSC in 2010. The apex court had also directed the state to complete the fresh selection process within five months. In pursuance to the SC order, the Haryana government on May 15 released a fresh advertisement to start the selection process and fixed the written examination for August 23.

100,['23/08/2020'],City lawyer moves MoEFCC to scrap licenses to 50 saw mills,"Nagpur: The controversial issue of giving additional horizontal bandsaw licences to 50 timber units in the state has once again come into focus. A city environment lawyer has filed an appeal with the environment ministry ( MoEFCC ) demanding scrapping of these licenses, which were issued in violation of apex court orders. A copy of the appeal has also been sent to Central Empowered Committee (CEC), monitoring implementation of the Supreme Court orders.

Though the forest department has put the issue on the back burner, environment lawyer Manish Jeswani has filed an application before MoEFCC regional office last week for condonation of delay and quashing the order passed by state level committee (SLC) headed by then PCCF UK Agrawal.

The SLC had on July 23, 2018, granted additional horizontal bandsaws to 50 units. This was in addition to existing cutting machines. The order violated apex court order issued on March 4, 1997, as well against Maharashtra Forest Rules 2014.

SLC member-secretary, state‚Äôs chief secretary and PCCF (HOFF) have been made as respondents. Jeswani being a third party and unaware about the impugned decision taken on July 23, 2018, urged for condonation of delay of 754 days mentioning various court rulings and existing circumstances in the present case. Affected parties are allowed to file objections in 60 days.

Jeswani has said that he learnt about the SLC decision this month and he took time to collect the documents. Therefore, there is no delay in filing appeal and requested for condonation in his appeal.

The lawyer has said there is serious violation of Supreme Court order (in writ petition 202/1995) which states: ‚ÄúAll unlicensed saw mills, veneer and plywood industries in Maharashtra and the UP are to be closed forthwith and the state governments would not remove or relax the condition for grant of permission or license for opening of any such industry and it shall also not grant any fresh license for this purpose.‚Äù

Senior forest officials, who were co-opted as members in SLC, pointed out decision to issue 50 licenses was against apex court order. Learning that SLC committed a mistake, on February 28, 2019, then PCCF Agrawal sought to amend Maharashtra Forest Rules, in order to regularize the ‚Äòillegal‚Äô licences for 50 additional 42 inch horizontal bandsaws, but government rejected the demand.

The petition says that SLC meeting held on June 27, 2017, had decided that grant of additional bandsaws shall be considered only after timber availability report received from the state. However, SLC under Agrawal took decision to issue licenses on July 23, 2018, without waiting for the timber availability reports.

Petition further says granting additional bandsaw licenses without timber availability report violates SC orders which mandate grant of licenses only after assessing availability of legal timber, carrying capacity and sustainability of forests.

Jeswani pointed out, ‚ÄúGranting additional bandsaws to existing licenses amounts to grant of fresh licence. It creates every possibility of illegal felling of trees inside forests for securing timber availability.‚Äù He alleged deliberate violation of rules and demanded quashing of SLC order to grant licences for additional horizontal bandsaws.

These offices will surely provide improved, timely, effective and coordinated action and also optimally utilise the existing resource.‚Äù

The notification further reads that these IROs will have a combined strength, including the ministry‚Äôs 319 personnel, NTCA (6), CZA (4), and WCCB (74). All the offices will be under one roof and it will be headed by the deputy director-general of forests.

Mahendra Singh Kachhawa, an advocate at the high court (forest and environment) said, ‚ÄúAll offices under one roof will ensure better efficiency and coordination. People can also receive appropriate clearances for industries, roads, mining, irrigation projects, cement and power projects without delay and in a transparent manner.‚Äù

Many believe this will also reduce illegal activities including mining, poaching, cutting of trees in the sanctuaries and tiger reserve of the state. Moreover, speedy correspondence with agencies like NTCA could benefit in tiger conservation.

Tapeshwar Singh Bhati, president of the Mukundra Hills Environment and Wildlife Society , Kota, said, ‚ÄúThe state has three tiger reserves and two are in the offing. After the death of two big cats in MHTR, the reintroduction programme is facing crisis. If NTCA office is established in the state, the officers will be able to regularly monitor the situation and can issue timely directions. Also, it will curb rampant illegal mining in Sariska and Mukundra as it will keep a check on forest staff.‚Äù

106,['23/08/2020'],Fake fans‚Äô cheers &amp; empty arenas: This is the new normal of watching sports on TV,"Avid sports follower David Wilson switched on his television last Friday night to watch the titanic Champions League tie between Bayern Munich and Barcelona at a high volume. He was keen to hear the vivid description of each dribble of Barca‚Äôs Lionel Messi , and every sharp header by Bayern‚Äôs Robert Lewandowski, as he did during the closed-door Test match series between England and West Indies .

As the match kicked off in the empty Lisbon arena, cheers of fans started reverberating in David‚Äôs Salunke Vihar home. ‚ÄúI was shocked and walked to the other room to check if my brother was watching some old game on his smartphone. But the ‚ÄòMan U‚Äô follower was fast asleep,‚Äù said David, a Messi fan.

As Barcelona‚Äôs 2-8 drubbing started soon after, the cheering in German turned louder. The teenager muted the TV‚Äôs sound.

Vivek Sathe echoed David. ‚ÄúI wanted to listen to the commentary on Neymar Junior‚Äôs cut-ins during the Champions League quarterfinal between Paris Saint-German and Atalanta, but the noise of fake fans frustrated me,‚Äù said Sathe, a techie.

The Covid-19 pandemic has changed the strategy of beaming of live closed-door matches. Sports fans are divided, too, over the artificial crowd noise.

Unlike Sathe and David, management trainee Sanjay Admane ‚Äî a cricket enthusiast ‚Äî sounded keen on the TV channel broadcasting the Pakistan vs England Test series making ‚Äúsome noise‚Äù. ‚ÄúSome cheers, even if they are artificial, are better than hearing the echoes around a quiet stadium,‚Äù said Admane.

With live sport on hold for over two months because of Covid-19, international broadcasters spent a lot of time thinking about how to make the telecast of closed-door ties interesting. A senior official of Sky Sports said, ‚ÄúWe want the viewers to have the best possible viewing experience ‚Äî even if they can‚Äôt be in the stadiums or watch matches with their family and friends.‚Äù

A source familiar with the making of the fake cheers of fans said Sky Sports, BBC and some other channels worked with ‚ÄòFIFA 20‚Äô video game publisher EA Sports to create a suite of club-specific crowd noises. The artificial noise, called EA Sports Atmospheric Audio, would create an atmosphere tailored to the occasion, she said.

‚ÄúSo, there would be lot of noise in the final of this edition of the Champions League, though PSG and Bayern would lock horns amid empty stands. I will love it,‚Äù Debashish Mukherjee, a follower of German football, said.

What‚Äôs in store during the upcoming Indian Premier League? ‚ÄúI expect some fun,‚Äù smiled Admane, waiting eagerly to watch Indian cricketers back in action after a long hiatus.

AHMEDABAD: Mayank (name changed), 11, a resident of a village near Palanpur in Banaskantha district, posed a medical challenge for doctors at KD Hospital in Ahmedabad, when he was brought in on May 29. The victim of a road accident, Mayank had deep lacerations on his face and chest that had exposed the interiors of his eye, nose, mouth, neck and chest.

The team consisted of neurosurgeons Dr Sandip Modh, Dr Gopal Shah, ER consultant Dr Vivek Ambalia, plastic surgeon Dr Rutvij Parikh, oculo-plastic surgeon Dr Sapan, and neonatologist Dr Snehal Patel. It worked on the case and decided on suturing instead of surgery.

‚ÄúOne of the major factors for the decision was multiple fractures including those of facial bones. There was the danger of a tear to the meninges ‚Äì the the layer between the skull and the brain.

111,['23/08/2020'],Start early and chase down your dream career,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Experts, who spoke at Mission Admission webinar series organized by Times of India in association with Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham , advised students to start a disciplined pursuit from the first year in college so that they will be able to avoid unnecessary stress in the final year and thus choose the right career.

‚ÄòCampus recruitment and stress on final year students‚Äô was the topic and the series which started on August 19 concluded on Saturday.

Jenty Joy, key coordinator of the placement officers‚Äô group in Kerala, said an engineering student won‚Äôt be burdened by stress in the final year if he/she started dreaming of a job in the second year and start working accordingly.

‚ÄúCompanies that come for recruitment do not ask a student about anything other than what he/she learned. If students get their basics right, they can easily get a job on course completion,‚Äù he said.

Dr Sebind Kumar, secretary, Indian psychiatric society (Kerala), said a little bit of stress helped students to get focus, meet targets and fare well in exams. However, one needs to know the breaking point where the stress starts affecting performance. ‚ÄúStress levels vary from person to person. If one feels depressed for more than two weeks, it‚Äôs time to seek medical help,‚Äù he said.

Mithun Vijay, former student coordinator of Sacred Heart College placement cell, said students need to exercise more caution while choosing courses and institutions for their degree and PG courses. ‚ÄúTeachers may not be able to help you much during job hunt. It‚Äôs the responsibility of students to prepare for a job and improve skills required for campus selection. Placement cell and the ecosystem on campus play a major role in this endeavour,‚Äù he said.

Aswin Ashok, another panellist and 2020 batch BTech graduate from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham who got placed in an MNC recently, said students should identify courses and subjects they like. ‚ÄúThere is no problem if you lose out a year or take a break. If your basics are fine and you are passionate about it. Opportunities will come to you,‚Äù he said.

114,['23/08/2020'],Tolly brigade urges single-screen owners not to lose hope,"Will Paradise close its doors forever? Will there be no queues at the ticket counters of Basusree ? Speculations are rife that the COVID-19 pandemic has cast a shadow over these two single-screen theatres. Though both the hall owners rubbished rumours of shutting down, it is no secret that single-screen theatres that were already bleeding continue to bear the brunt of this prolonged lockdown. ‚ÄúWe were the first to close and the last to open. This is a place for social gathering and hence it is difficult for us to cope with the ongoing practice of social distancing,‚Äù said Sunit Singh, spokesperson of Paradise. They have recently mailed ‚Äòtemporary suspension of work‚Äô notice to Eastern India Motion Pictures Association. Amid this uncertainty, a host of actors and actresses, who started their journey way before multiplexes came into existence, requested the hall owners to ‚Äúkeep calm and carry on‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt is these single-screen theatres that made us stars. We should all be united to see it through,‚Äù they said. Read on...As I told CT earlier, the experience of watching movies on big screens is unmatched. Yes, the situation is grim. Every sector is suffering due to the pandemic. But the exhibitors and the hall owners have to keep faith. The industry should unite and stand by these halls. There should be a waiver of taxes for at least three to five years. Hall owners should also come up with sustainable ideas as how to make the movie-watching experience special for patrons. I have been planning a roadmap for the betterment of the industry. These halls are also a part of the plan and I will try to do my bit.‚Äî Jeet, actorEvery industry is going through a bad phase because of this pandemic and so is our entertainment industry. This is the year of survival, not about profit or loss. I keep telling everyone that let us just sail through this difficult time. Once the vaccine is there, we will bounce back with a bang. Single-screen theatres have been going through a tough period since long and this pandemic has worsened it further. For single-screen theatres to survive, we need good content so that the audience can go back to theatres. There should be a system where films are released in a fairway. I still remember what I had to face last Puja, where all production houses wanted their films to release which didn‚Äôt help anyone in the long run. The audience of single-screen theatres made us stars, so I am sure we have that capacity to bring that audience back again with good content.‚Äî DevFirst of all, one must get over the fear of this pandemic. After that, every stakeholder should come forward to revive these halls. These single screens used to be the backbone of our industry. Even today, my rural fan base depends on these halls. They have less budget than the multiplexes to stay afloat during the lockdown. Once the halls reopen, they will have to ensure the patrons that these halls are safe to visit. I have always taken initiatives in their promotional plans. I have encouraged them to host my film premieres in single screen theatres. But it cannot be an initiative of one person. We have to see through it together.‚Äî Rituparna SenguptaThe single screens were suffering even before the pandemic. The so-called intellectuals used to criticise these films. Even good content failed to bring back the audience to the theatres. According to me, hit films, which used to run for months, should re-run in single screens once they reopen, as that might just do magic. My film, Beder Meye Josna , made history in single-screen theatres.‚Äî Chiranjeet ChakrabortySingle screens were already in bad condition as there was hardly any business and these past five months of the pandemic turned out to be the final nail in the coffin. People have too many options now. I read that there will be only 25-30% occupancy in this new normal, which I feel won‚Äôt do any good to theatre owners. People will be in a two minds before visiting a theatre, sit in an air-conditioned hall for two and a half hours, to watch a film.‚Äî Satabdi Roy",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77698896,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-75276/77698896.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/bengali/movies/news/tolly-brigade-urges-single-screen-owners-not-to-lose-hope/articleshow/77698896.cms

BHOPAL: Heavy rains that lashed the state capital on Saturday, severely affected the movement of flights at Bhopal airport . With 3 ft water logged at the airport runway, no flight could land. Out of five flights scheduled, three were cancelled while two were diverted to other routes.

Till the time of filing this report, airport team was busy removing water from the runway. This is the first time in the recent past that water has been logged at runway at such a scale that it caused cancellation of all flights in a day.

Several parts in the state capital were waterlogged due to heavy rains in Bhopal in the past 24 hours. The central line of Raja Bhoj Airport runway was also flooded, due to which all the five flights from Bangalore, Hyderabad and Delhi to Bhopal were cancelled.

After overnight heavy rains, airport officials tried to remove water but it couldn‚Äôt be done in time, forcing IndiGo flight to divert from Mumbai to Nagpur in the morning. IndiGo flights from Delhi-Bhopal-Delhi, Hyderabad-Bhopal-Hyderabad, Bangalore-Bhopal-Bangalore had to be cancelled.

Director airport, Anil Vikram, said, ""Our team has been working to remove water from runway. As a lot of water has still been logged at the runway, flights could not land today.‚Äù

Due to these cancellations, several passengers who had to reach Bhopal were quite upset. ""As Ganesh festival began on Saturday, I had planned to stay with my family on weekend. Rain has played a spoilsport. My entire weekend has been ruined now,"" said a passenger Aniruddh. He was to reach Bhopal from Mumbai.

126,['23/08/2020'],"What rejuvenation? Rampant dumping of waste by locals in Rispana, Bindal","DEHRADUN: To avoid paying garbage collection fees levied by Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC), many people living in areas near Rispana and Bindal are simply dumping their household waste into the rivers, cocking a snook at plans drafted by the state government to rejuvenate these water bodies.

The waste eventually goes on to pollute the Ganga too, since the two Doon rivers merge into the Saung which further ahead merges into the Ganga.

Talking to TOI, a retired Army officer and resident of Vijay Colony said, ‚ÄúIt is unfortunate that the household waste is being dumped into the rivers for which a rejuvenation programme by the government is currently on. The waste is further polluting the Ganga at a time when the central government is running major projects to depollute the rivers.‚Äù

Pollution of the riverbeds, already severe through the year, has become worse in monsoon when the rivers are in a spate.

Vijay Kutiyal, another resident of the area, said, ‚ÄúIt shows the amount of muck, kitchen waste and garbage are being dumped into the riverbed upstream before the rains. It is indeed shameful that we citizens lack basic civic sense to keep our city's surroundings clean. The municipal authorities have arranged proper garbage collection covering the entire city for a nominal rate of Rs 50 per month, which many residents avoid paying and are instead dumping their waste into the riverbed.‚Äù

When municipal commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey was queried about the matter, he said, ‚ÄúKeeping the city clean and garbage-free is a collective responsibility of the citizens and the agencies involved. As and when the matter is brought to our notice by the residents, we take prompt action and stop any such activities.‚Äù

127,['23/08/2020'],Cash-strapped state govt defaults on power subsidy payment,"Patiala: With the economy hit hard by the Covid-19 crisis, the state government has failed to clear payment for power subsidies being given to various categories of consumers during the first four months of the current fiscal.

According to official documents, the state government is yet to pay Rs 3,489.74 crore to Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) for free power. From April 1 to August 15, the state government was supposed to pay Rs 6,696.07 crore to PSPCL. However, the government has only released Rs 2,384.76 crore to the power corporation.

Records show that in April, the government released three installments of Rs 135.43 crore, Rs 165.87 crore and Rs 200 crore to PSPCL. In May, the government released three installments of Rs 100 crore, one installment of Rs 200 crore and one installment of Rs 535.3 2 crore.

In June, five installments of Rs 150 crore, Rs 16.25 crore, Rs 31 5.15 crore, Rs 117.95 crore and Rs 14.68 crore were released. In July, a single installment of Rs 150 crore and in August Rs 379.22 crore was released to PSPCL.

The state government also asked the power corporation to adjust electricity duty worth Rs 267.37 crore and infrastructure development fund worth Rs 821.57 crore collected by the power utility from consumers against power subsidies.

The total subsidy bill for the current fiscal stands at Rs 16,400.26 crore, which is more than 53% of the annual revenue requirement of the power corporation. This also includes a carry forward of Rs 5,297.55 crore from previous years.

This year, the government is providing free power worth Rs 6,810.51 crore to agricultural connections, Rs 1,599.87 crore to LS supply consumers and Rs 1,263.37 to Scheduled Caste (SC) domestic supply (DS). Backward class DS consumer will get free power worth Rs 173.10 crore, medium supply consumers will get a subsidy of Rs 165.51 crore and small power industrial units will get Rs 162.41 crore against concessional tariff of Rs 4.99 per unit. Non-SC BPL DS consumers will get Rs 75.58 crore and freedom fighters will get Rs 0.83 crore as subsidy on power during the current fiscal.

Sources in the power corporation said that during the lockdown, the Corporation lost Rs 20 crore every day, which had an adverse effect on its financial health.

According to an order issued by Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC), Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) can impose full tariff on all categories of power consumers in case the state government fails to release subsidy amount in advance.

Former chief engineer of the erstwhile Punjab State Electricity Board (PSEB), Padamjit Singh, on whose petition PSERC had empowered the PSPCL to charge full tariff in case of subsidy default, said the electricity duty and infrastructure development fund are collected from consumers and are supposed to be ploughed back into power or infrastructure development so that the resulting benefits flow back to consumers. However, neither the electricity duty nor infrastructure development fund were utilised as envisaged.

Meanwhile, the government is trying to implement direct benefit transfer of electricity (DBTE) for agriculture consumers, for which a pilot project was launched in a few districts in 2018. Under the scheme, farmers get the subsidy in cash ( Rs 48,000 for each connection annually) against power used, irrespective of the actual power consumed.

The state government is also considering the proposal to fuel agricultural feeders with solar power to the use cost of power subsidies being provided to agricultural pump sets without affecting the facility of free power for agriculture. However, a final decision in this regard is yet to be taken.

Kiran has been working as a sanitation employee in the civil hospital for the last seven years.

Police commissioner Gurpreet Singh Bhullar said the accused intended to sell the infant for around Rs four lakh and distribute the money among themselves equally.

‚ÄúPreliminary interrogation of the accused revealed that on August 20 at 12.40pm, the accused, Gurpreet Singh Gopi and Gurpreet Singh Peeta reached the civil hospital in an SUV. They were in constant touch with Ranjeet, Davinder Kaur and Kiran on the phone.

The Diamond City has 60 PCR vans distributed among different police stations. These vans are used for patrolling and are the first to respond to any crime scene.

After receiving a call, the control room alerts the specific police station and PCR van which reaches the spot at the earliest.

‚ÄúI was examining the performance of PCR vans and found that they are working efficiently. In a few cases the cops have responded in a short time and I have also rewarded,‚Äù said Tomar.

A PCR van of Athwalines police station reached a spot of wall collapse within five minutes of being alerted on August 13. In another incident on August 16, a PCR Van of Khatodara police station reached New Civil Hospital within five minutes and prevented conflict between relatives of a deceased patient and hospital staff.

In four incidents PCR vans successfully prevented probable mob lynching in different parts of the city with timely response.

130,['23/08/2020'],"In a first, UP to pay compensation for killing of pet dogs by big cats; proposal sought","Representative image

PILIBHIT: In a first , farmers whose pet dogs are killed by big cats will soon be getting compensation in accordance to the breed and market value of the pet, with the UP government gearing up to clear the deck by introducing an amendment in the forest law.

‚ÄúPrincipal secretary (forest) Sudhir Garg has sought a proposal for amending the forest law to include a new provision that will enable the government to pay monetary compensation to farmers whose pet dogs are killed by big cats. The compensation will, however, be decided based on the dog‚Äôs breed and its monetary value,‚Äù Pilibhit Tiger Reserve field director H Rajamohan told a nine-member farmers' delegation from Amaria block led by Paramveer Singh Perry during a meeting on Saturday.

Speaking to TOI, Rajamohan said, ‚ÄúThe principal secretary took the decision when I informed him about the protest by farmers of villages under Amaria block following the killings of their costly pet dogs by a stray leopard and no corresponding compensation in the absence of any provision of compensation in such cases in the forest law.‚Äù

More than one and a half dozens of fine breeds of dogs were killed by big cats in a year. Farmer Harjeet Singh from Rasoola village claimed that his Great Dane, the price of which was Rs 90,000, was killed by a feline.

When farmers raised the issue of killing of their cattle by the big cats, Rahamohan assured them of providing on the spot postmortem facility in the future to ensure each such cases was entertained for the payment of compensation.

PTR authorities and the farmers also agreed to help each other in trapping the prowling leopards and translocation of sugarcane tigers after successful estimation.

‚ÄúAuthentic estimation by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and the state forest administration is required for getting an approval to translocate Amaria tigers,‚Äù said Rajamohan.

‚ÄúThe process of relocating the tigers will be raised as soon as the tiger estimation report reaches the state headquarters and the NTCA,‚Äù added Rajamohan.

Following the meeting, the farmers lifted their protest after five days over the killing of their 25-30 domestic animals, including dogs, by a prowling leopard in one year ‚Äî during which they had barred the entry of forest staff in their farms and halted the camera installation process by WWF for the first official estimation of sugarcane tigers in Amaria.

Perry from Surajpur village, meanwhile, complained about the negligent attitude of the forest officials in addressing their issues. ‚ÄúFarmers in my village grow mango and guava on over 50 acres following repeated appeals by forest and wildlife division officers, but monkeys in packs have been damaging the fruit crops, but the officials are completely negligent in addressing the situation.‚Äù

Divisional forest officer Sanjeev Kumar, however, assured the farmers that last Friday, he received the chief wildlife warden‚Äôs permission to catch the monkeys and the work would be started on ground zero from Monday and completed within a week.

131,['23/08/2020'],Opening of elevated carriageway will go long way in tackling traffic bottleneck on NH at Phagwara,"Jalandhar: The biggest traffic bottleneck on six-lane Jalandhar-Panipat National Highway was partially cleared on Saturday, with the opening of the traffic from one side of the elevated main carriageway at Phagwara. The carriage was opened by Union minister Som Parkash in the presence of National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) officials. Local officials and Congress leaders were conspicuous by their absence.

As there has been credit war for construction of the carriage way, local administration and Punjab government were not involved in the opening.

The Union minister opened the carriage way by breaking a coconut in the presence of NHAI officials and local leaders of SAD-BJP, including district SAD president and SGPC member Sarwan Singh Kular.

The one side of the main carriage way has been opened making it possible for two-way traffic for vehicles bypassing Phagwara. Though only one side has been opened, it has come as a big reprieve for the long-route traffic as well as for the local residents. Unlike the usual congestion throughout the day on the two sides of the NH, where traffic would snarl, the side lanes had minimal traffic on Saturday.

The earlier design for the carriage-way was unfeasible as it cut the town in two with provision of just two underpasses. However, after local residents protested, then Union minister of state Vijay Sampla got the work halted and lobbied for a new design.

Even Union minister Nitin Gadkari, while laying the foundation stone of the 2.55 km long project on February 25, last year had said the incomplete work at Phagwara was a major bottleneck among half dozen bottlenecks on Panipat-Jalandhar National Highway and the issue had much complications.

132,['23/08/2020'],Nagpur News - Times of India,"They got ownership of the land in 1991. It remained a kind of short-halt spot between home and factory for some years. They didn‚Äôt have the faintest idea what to do with the property until he was gifted 60 saplings on his 60th birthday. That‚Äôs when Sukesh and Sudha Gandhi decided that they would grow their own forest. What was once acres of rock-strewn land covered with invasive weeds has now grown into a dense two-hectare forest with over 10,000 trees ‚Äî all thanks to the couple who believed that forests could grow in cities too.

The biome, single-handedly nurtured by the Gandhis, now in their 60s, since nearly eight years now, is home to over 50 tree species, medicinal plants, hundreds of birds and all kinds of biodiversity. Located in Wakeshwar village around 20 kilometres from Nagpur zero mile, the land now comes under the metro region. ‚ÄúWhen I purchased the land 30 years back, it was a scrub and rocky land with hardly any trees. We had always wanted a lush farm but, back then, we were too involved with work,‚Äù Sukesh, who was in the pharmaceutical field, tells TOI trekking through the vast expanse of multi-shaded green.

For a few years, all that the couple had in the barren land was a small tent where they would occasionally have tea and snacks. When eight years ago they sold off their respective businesses, the Gandhis, bothered about the depleting green cover due to urbanization, decided to do their green bit.

Sudha proudly points to a cluster of trees. ‚ÄúIn 2012, when Sukesh got the sapling gift, we decided to plant it here as we did not have enough space at our city home. Then began our journey of creating a forest,‚Äù says the 67-year-old.

Soon after the state government announced the massive 33 crore plantation target, the couple got around 1,200 saplings from the forest department and planted them at the property. ‚ÄúHardly 20-25 survived. It was frustrating, depressing. We had failed to protect the trees from grazing and there was water shortage too,‚Äù recalls Sukesh, as he instructs a staffer to remove the overgrown weeds. We are now deep in the Gandhi forest.

Planting trees became an uphill task for them. It took the couple immense research, consultation with experts and repeated experimentation to finally get it right. Sukesh says, ‚ÄúThe first thing we did was to fence the area to protect the plantations from grazing and wild animals.‚Äù

A small nursery on our route comes as a surprise. Sudha, who has always been a plant lover, says, ‚ÄúWe realized that if we plant saplings directly, the survival rate tends to be low. So I started getting saplings from a nursery in Vijayawada and would first grow the plants till 8-10 feet in our nursery here before planting them in the pits. This method started giving us good survival rate.‚Äù

The next thing that stumbles upon our way is a water body. ‚ÄúWhen we started expanding our plantations, it was becoming very difficult to ensure regular and adequate watering. To overcome this, we got into an agreement with the irrigation department which has permitted us to draw water from a nearby lake for the next 18 years. We have installed drip irrigation system all across the property to ensure that the trees survive. And then there is this pond too,‚Äù says Sukesh.

The couple has been carrying out the afforestation activity under NGO Chip, Nagpur. Their property is surrounded by a zudpi jungle coming under Butibori range forest.

A few years back, the story of their mini-forest spread like wildfire and a curious forest officer came by. Impressed by their high survival rate, the officer offered them a tripartite agreement with the forest department, under which the couple would be provided 15 hectares of land for plantations. ‚ÄúThe agreement is in process and we intend to plant around 25,000 trees in the adjoining forest land,‚Äù says Sukesh.

‚ÄúWe realized that we lie between two bigger forests. Consequently, we had the potential of becoming a bridge between these two areas. A protected plantation would restore the wild habitat for the animals and the birds and also recreate a corridor that had probably got destroyed because of expanding human civilization,‚Äù he adds.

The couple‚Äôs efforts have also led to an increase in the groundwater table of the area and massive reduction in the cases of forest fires.

It wouldn‚Äôt be an overstatement to say that their man-made forest is greener, healthier and chirpier (with over a 100 bird species) than its neighbouring natural forests.

After walking a full circle in their green abode, we are greeted by a bunch of attractive bonsai plants. ‚ÄúThese are as old as my kids. My daughters know these plants are like my babies and they would often tease me that I love them more,‚Äù says Sudha.

We catch our breath in front of a century-old banyan tree. The Gandhis, parents of two daughters and grandparents of four, don‚Äôt know what the future holds for them. What they do know is that they will keep bringing in more and more life in their urban jungle, till their last breath. ‚ÄúIf we live through our 70s, we hope to have planted 50,000 trees,‚Äù Sudha and Sukesh say.

The decision has been taken after residents of the locality, Arish Colony , and several journalists raised the issue and highlighted facts.

‚ÄúWe have asked DCP (zone-II) to conduct an inquiry into the matter, the report of which is likely to be placed at the earliest. Action will be initiated if policemen are found guilty,‚Äù Prasad told TOI.

Senior police officers have expressed anguish over the Jinsi police not keeping them in the loop about registering of offences. A senior officer confirmed that he learned about it only on Friday morning.

Based on the complaint lodged by a 45-year-old woman, Jinsi police late on Thursday night booked two men on the charges of molestation, using foul and abusive language, and threatening her with dire consequences.

The woman claimed that the alleged incident took place on the night of August 9. However, residents of the posh locality, along with the journalists, lodged a strong protest against the police action.

While demanding that the CCTV cameras installed in the locality are scanned, serious allegations have also been made against the Jinsi police and its detection branch for registering the offence ‚Äúwithout verifying things‚Äù and ‚Äútrying to shield the woman complainant‚Äù.

The residents said the woman rented a flat in the locality a few months ago. They alleged that men, some of them in an inebriated condition, started coming to her flat even during odd hours, following which they took an objection with the landlord.

The residents said that they lodged complaints against the woman with the Jinsi police as well as with the commissioner of police‚Äôs office, but in vain.

136,['23/08/2020'],Longer wait before guests get liquor at hotels in Delhi,"After being closed for nearly five months, many hotels opened on Saturday after DDMA‚Äôs permission to operate

NEW DELHI: Alcohol lovers planning to have a good time in Delhi‚Äôs hotels and restaurants will have to wait longer.

In response to Delhi government ‚Äôs recent order, which permitted hotels and restaurants to serve liquor to guests , the excise department has written back saying that Delhi Disaster Management Authority ‚Äôs permission is needed before allowing hotels and restaurants to serve liquor to guests.

After being closed for nearly five months, many hotels opened on Saturday. The DDMA had permitted hotels to open from Thursday with strict social distancing norms. Delhi has close to 2,500 hotels, including many starred hotels.

Due to Covid-19 pandemic, all liquor shops were closed since the lockdown began. The excise revenue has been low despite all efforts of the government. It prompted deputy CM Manish Sisodia to recently direct the exercise department to issue necessary permission for service of liquor in the restaurants and clubs by licences at the table and in the hotel rooms.

‚ÄúUnder the unlock guidelines, Delhi government has allowed operation of restaurants subject to social distancing norms. In the DDMA meeting, the government has allowed opening of hotels. Bars will remain closed under the provision of unlock guidelines of the ministry of home affairs. However, several state governments, including Assam, Punjab and Rajasthan, have permitted service of liquor by licence holders under the excise rules at the table in the restaurants and clubs and in the hotel rooms,‚Äù Sisodia, who is also the excise minister, stated in the letter. He said service of liquor in hotels and restaurants was important considering the revenue implications.

According to sources, all the economic activities under unlock guidelines are allowed only with the approval of DDMA, which is chaired by the lieutenant governor. Since the issue has now hit a wall, it is likely that the guests willing to have liquor in hotel rooms or restaurants will have to wait longer.

137,['23/08/2020'],"IDPL retirees living in township in financial trouble, fear eviction","Haridwar: Retirees from Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited (IDPL), Rishikesh ‚Äî once Asia‚Äôs biggest antibiotics plant and India‚Äôs the biggest pharmaceutical company ‚Äî say they are facing ‚Äútough times‚Äù. Seventeen years after they retired, they are yet to receive part of their retirement benefits, while they are being asked to pay penal rent for their apartments in the IDPL township, even though a 1997 high court order specifies not to do so unless all their dues are cleared, said Retirees Welfare Association (RWA) president Asheem Kumar Majumdar. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been running from pillar to post for justice, but to no avail,‚Äù he added.

IDPL general manager Sanjai Kumar Sinha told TOI over the phone from Delhi that the ‚Äúallegations are without substance‚Äù. IDPL has paid them all their dues, including provident fund, gratuity and leave encashment, besides compensation for their remaining service period, he said. Yet, 1,335 of them are still occupying houses in the township, which they should have vacated within six months of their retirement, he added.

All except 170 of the 2300 employees, opting for voluntary retirement from service (VRS) in 2003, signed a bond with IDPL in September the same year committing that they will claim no interest on their unpaid dues and that IDPL will be free to get their houses vacated any time after six months of their retirement. But about 1335 retirees still continue to occupy IDPL houses, and have caused the company huge financial damage during the 17 years, Sinha alleged.

Majumdar though claimed penal rent (22 times the original) was imposed on them in 2003 for not vacating the houses, thus violating a 1997 high court order which said no penal rent can be charged unless an employee‚Äôs dues have been cleared. The rent was reduced to half the penal amount in 2004, with the intervention of then Union minister of chemicals and fertilisers Ram Vilas Paswan, though the order was implemented only in December 2006. Ever since, retirees have been paying Rs 550 per month for a C-type house, for example, whose original rent was Rs 50, Majumdar explained.

Founded by Jawaharlal Nehru in 1962, in collaboration with Russia, IDPL was commissioned in 1967. In 1992, the company with around 5,000 employees was declared a sick unit by the Bureau of Industrial Financial Reconstruction (BIFR), and production stopped in 1996. But the company continued to pay salary to employees for no work until 2003, when VRS was introduced. Out of 2,500 remaining employees, around 2,300 opted for the scheme and the company was practically closed. At that time, their salaries, which had not been revised since 1984, were very low. As such, their retirement benefits were meager. Yet, even these were not paid in full, Majumdar regretted, adding that the dues range from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2.5 lakh (plus 10% interest since 2003), as per a Supreme Court order.

A delegation of RWA members met Union chemicals and fertilisers minister Sadananda Gowda on September 6, 2019, who assured that he will write to the state chief minister not to evict the retirees from their houses. He also assured that as demanded by the delegation, he will recommend to the CM that the state government should run the company‚Äôs formulation block, which had been functioning till October 2019 with about 200 contractual employees. Earlier, in 2006, a high powered committee sent to IDPL by the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office had recommended that the retirees‚Äô benefits be paid out, Majumdar said. But no action in the matter was taken, he added.

Apprehending that water and electricity connections to their houses could be severed any time, as there was no management body for the township, the retirees demanded that it should be included within Rishikesh municipal corporation. Mayor Anita Mamgai told TOI, ‚ÄúA resolution to the effect has been adopted by the corporation and will be sent to the government. But it might take time to get approved and implemented.‚Äù

RWA has contemplated going to court to get the retirees‚Äô grievances redressed. However, they have been advised against it by Union MoS for chemicals and fertilisers Mansukh Mandviya and joint secretary (pharmaceuticals) Rajanish Singhal, who have assured an early resolution of their issues, said Majumdar.

KOLKATA: Virtual darshans, smaller idols and no processions to mark the arrival and immersion of idols: Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations in homes, complexes and even shops are witnessing several changes this year due to the pandemic .

The city has been witnessing a steep rise in Ganesh Puja over the past decade with several ‚Äòbarwari‚Äô committees as well as residential complexes joining in the celebrations. Among many business families, however, it has been a tradition to organize Ganesh Puja at home or at their offices, seeking blessing from the god of prosperity . But this time, several families have cut down on all festivities and reduced the celebrations to a mere ritual to minimize the risk of the spread of the novel coronavirus. The two back-to-back days of lockdown before the Puja also did not offer much time for preparations. A lot of people went out shopping for idols, flowers and sweets at the last moment on Saturday.

‚ÄúWe went out on Saturday morning and bought a 3ft-high Ganesh idol, along with some flowers and sweets for the puja on Sunday. In previous years, it used to be an occasion for the entire family to celebrate the festival together. The arrival of the idol would be the highpoint and then, we would decorate the place and make arrangements for the puja. This year, it will be a mere ritual,‚Äù said Harish Bali, a Posta businessman and Lake Town resident.

At CE Block in New Town, only a handful people could be seen inside the pandal on Saturday. ‚ÄúIt is a basic affair this year. The puja will be live-streamed online, especially for darshan for senior citizens and those who are unwell. We have allowed very few people in the mandap, keeping in mind the safety measures in place,‚Äù said Samir Gupta of the CE Block Cultural Association.

Several businessmen even shifted the puja from their shops and offices to their homes to ensure minimal gathering. ‚ÄúLast year, we invited everybody from the market to the puja at my shop. But this year, it would have been very risky to do that. So, I decided to hold a small puja at home,‚Äù said Vineet Saraf, a businessman at Bagri Market.

She was initially being treated for typhoid at Almora district hospital but was referred to Base Hospital Almora, a Covid facility, after she developed breathing difficulties. The district hospital, suspecting Covid, referred her to Base Hospital saying they did not have antigen test kits.However, Devi‚Äôs report came negative at the Base Hospital. But by that time, her condition had deteriorated. The hospital provided her an oxygen cylinder but refused to admit her, saying it did not have an ICU facility and only treated Covid patients. By the time Devi reached district hospital, she had nearly lost her battle with life.‚ÄúThe oxygen cylinder Base Hospital gave us ran out within 20 minutes. We begged for another cylinder at the district hospital and the adjoining district female hospital, but the authorities refused, saying they did not have one to spare,‚Äù said Sundar Singh Bisht, Devi‚Äôs brother-in-law who was with her in her last moments.

On being asked why they refused to admit a patient in need of emergency treatment, Dr SC Garkoti, principal medical superintendent (PMS), Base Hospital Almora said, ‚ÄúThe patient was stabilised and sent back.

ADG (prisons) Sunil Ramanand said: ‚ÄúThe Bombay HC has converted a news report accusing Hiralal Jadhav of mishandling the Covid-19 situation into a public interest litigation. The HC has directed the deputy inspector general (prisons) to conduct an inquiry and submit the report within three months.‚Äù

The officer said this is one of the two probes being faced by Jadhav. The other one was ordered after the recording of an inmate‚Äôs call to a fellow inmate‚Äôs family demanding money went viral on social media.

Taking cognizance of the news reports out in the vernacular media, the HC admitted a suo motu PIL in the case of alleged mishandling of a Covid-19 case. It has been alleged that a Covid-positive inmate was kept with others, which let to 29 inmates getting infected at the prison.

Citing the contents of the affidavit, division bench of HC, comprising Justices Ravindra Ghuge and MG Sewlikar, observed: ‚ÄúBefore his (Covid-19 positive inmate‚Äôs) swab test dated May 30 was received, he was shifted to the temporary prison at SBOA school along with several inmates. This was a blunder resulting in infecting 29 prisoners. Therefore, we find that an enquiry needs to be conducted by an officer of the level of the Deputy Inspector General of Prisons, State of Maharashtra , or any such officer of equivalent rank as may be directed by the Additional Director General of Prisons at Pune.‚Äù

HC has asked ADG (prisons) ‚ÄúTo adopt an appropriate procedure to conduct an enquiry into the issue...‚Äù It added: ‚ÄúWe expect that the enquiry would be concluded within a period of three months and the report would be submitted by the concerned enquiry officer to the ADG (Prisons), Pune, for disciplinary action, if any person is held guilty of negligence or dereliction of duties.‚Äù

BAREILLY: Bareilly has reported a sharp increase in cases of plasmodium falciparum (PF), the ""killer"" strain of malaria, as 435 people have been infected this month, up from 11 cases in July. Only 152 PF cases were reported between January and July.

Officials said of the total 435 PF cases reported in August, nearly 20% cases are of relapse as the patients didn't complete a full course of treatment last year and were carrying malaria parasites in the body.

According to the latest data compiled by health department, Bareilly reported a total of 1,314 malaria cases in August. Of these, 879 are plasmodium vivax (PV), a common variant of malaria, and 435 PF. In July, 853 malaria cases were reported and of these, 11 were PF.

District malaria officer D R Singh said the transmission of malaria is usually at its peak from August to mid-October.

Chief medical officer ( CMO ) Dr Vineet Shukla said, ‚ÄúIn monsoon, the malaria cases go up due to mosquito breeding. We have been conducting active case surveillance by sending our teams to affected villages to screen suspected cases. We are conducting preventive measures, including spraying of pyrethrum and larvicidal, and conducting indoor residual spray and fogging in villages which have been reporting cases.‚Äù

Experts said a patient tested positive for PF malaria has to undergo a three-day treatment while a patient with PV malaria has to complete a 14-day course. ‚ÄúHowever, many patients leave the medication halfway after a few doses. These patients then carry malaria parasites in their blood. We have learnt through our ASHA workers and patients that nearly 20% of the total 435 PF cases reported this month are due to relapse,‚Äù Singh added.

Last year, health workers visited houses of PF patients daily to ensure that they complete treatment. PV patients are covered by health workers in first, third, seventh and 14th days of treatment. ‚ÄúWe have directed ASHA workers to visit the houses of malaria patients to ensure radical treatment,‚Äù the CMO added.

Bareilly has reported a malaria outbreak in the past two years. Though only 271 people tested positive for malaria in Bareilly in 2017, the number of cases drastically increased to 37,482 in 2018, and 46,717 in 2019.

145,['23/08/2020'],Child marriage: SOS calls reveal U16 kids vulnerable,"Times View The first law banning child marriage was passed way back in 1929. The prevalence of the regressive practice over 90 years later, despite strengthening the law further intermittently, only highlights how deep rooted the problem is. It also tells us that the best way to end the custom is through stronger social awareness and stricter implementation of a law that is reasonable. Raising the legal age of marriage is unlikely to make a significant difference and might end up criminalizing marriages at ages that most of the world considers legitimate.

NEW DELHI: At a time when the government is exploring raising the legal age of marriage, SOS calls to the national helpline (1098) that led to interventions in 14,775 cases related to child marriage during January-July period show that a significant number of children below 16 years remain vulnerable.While 59% (8,732) of the cases involved children between 16-18 years, a worrisome 38% (5,629) involved children in the age group of 11-15 years. The age-wise data also shows that there were 91 cases involving children in the 6-10 years' age bracket and 87 cases were of those below five years of age.During the same period last year, total interventions related to child marriage were higher at 17,181.Data from pre-Covid, lockdown and post-lockdown periods reflect that barring the lockdown period, child marriage cases were up by 17-20% when compared to data from last year. During lockdown, there was an evident decline when compared with last year's figures for March to May.During lockdown while the helpline intervened in 5333 child marriage-related cases, there was an evident decline when compared with last year‚Äôs figures for March to May. The data shows that while in March 2019, Childline intervened in 2424 cases, the number was down by 6% to 2267 this year. In April, which was the peak of the lockdown, there were 849 child marriage cases which was a 70% decline over last year‚Äôs 2840 cases in the same month. In May, 2217 cases required intervention as against 3957 last year-a decline of 44%.Childline officials pointed that this decline in numbers must be studied with caution in the context of the lockdown as it was largely a result of restrictions on movement and public functions. Also under-reporting during the lockdown cannot be ruled out.The data for June explains the problem at hand and how post lockdown period has brought along new challenges. It turns out that when unlock 1.0 came into force, child marriage-related interventions shot up to 3300. The June interventions were 17% more than last year‚Äôs 2869. July too registered an increase over last year with 1966 interventions as against 1675 in 2019.According to Chidline, in nearly 99% of the cases, the helpline intervened to prevent the marriage. In about 1% cases, the teams intervened to get cases registered as the marriage had taken place.Voluntary organisations pointed that the months ahead would be critical, given that economic hardships, loss of livelihood and fear of many girls dropping out of schools could lead to an increase in child marriage cases.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77698944,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-96504,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/child-marriage-sos-calls-reveal-u16-kids-vulnerable/articleshow/77698945.cms

In his address, Chouhan said that PCC chief Kamal Nath was reciting the ‚ÄòHanuman Chalisa‚Äô on the foundation stone laying ceremony day (of Ram temple). Chanting ‚ÄòHanuman Chalisa‚Äô helps devotees, not devils.

On Congress calling Scindia traitor, Chouhan said in the past too, big leaders have left Congress due to its policies. Nath had bluffed people of the state, he added.

Launching a scathing attack on former CM Nath, Scindia said, ‚ÄúPrime Minister Narendra Modi imposed a Covid-19 lockdown to save the lives of people, but Nath had put Vallabh Bhavan under lockdown for the public for his entire 15-month term‚Äù.

BJP leaders said thousands of Congress party workers will join the saffron party in the ongoing drive and people of the region will teach Congress a befitting lesson in the upcoming bypolls. A statement issued by BJP on Friday claimed that a large number of Congress workers from all 16 constituencies in the Gwalior-Chambal region are set to join the party.

During the three-day drive, Chouhan, Scindia, Tomar and Sharma will hold talks with the party‚Äôs public representatives and office-bearers of the region to draw a strategy for the bypolls, the dates of which are yet to be announced, it added.

Twenty-two rebel Congress MLAs, mostly from the Scindia camp, resigned in March, reducing the Nath-led dispensation to a minority and paving the way for BJP to form the government in Madhya Pradesh.

BJP sent Scindia to Rajya Sabha, while many of his loyalists got important portfolios in the Chouhan cabinet.

Last month, three more Congress MLAs resigned and joined the saffron party, taking their number to 25, while two assembly seats had fallen vacant due to the demise of legislators.

Congress has 89 MLAs in the House, while the ruling BJP has 107. The effective strength of the 230-member House has come down to 203 due to the resignations and deaths of legislators.

149,['23/08/2020'],Delhi: Cheap China models a bother for smog gun startups,"NEW DELHI: With anti-smog guns being touted as an effective way of combating air pollution , several startups have come up over the past few years.With models ranging between Rs 1.5 lakh for small mist generators and Rs 35 lakh for truck mounted smog cannons, various anti-smog guns and ionising cannons are now being sold in the market. The cost depends on the size of the area to be covered and mist droplet variations.Many manufacturers who have launched their companies in the past two-three years told TOI that they had received orders from many big private construction companies. However, cheaper, less effective Chinese variants are a cause of concern, rued some entrepreneurs. These are being used just to show compliance with the anti-pollution guildelines, they alleged.An anti-smog gun sprays atomised water ‚Äî tiny droplets ‚Äî into the atmosphere, creating artificial mist, which is expected to stick to airborne pollutants and bring them down to the ground. The Supreme Court has not only okayed installation of anti-smog guns in the capital but also made them mandatory for construction projects that require environmental clearance and have a built-up area of over 20,000 square metres.Ashwani Srivastava, managing director of Ghazibad-based Quality Enviro Engineers, said they had sold more than 200 anti-smog guns. ‚ÄúWe sell customised machines covering 20m, 50m or even 100m radius. The droplet size of mist varies from 10 to 60 micron,‚Äù he said, adding that private construction companies were their main clients. ‚ÄúMost of the customers are located in highly polluted areas in north India and some mining towns.‚ÄùThe company has boycotted Chinese components, said Srivastava. ‚ÄúMany people are using cheap Chinese versions but those machines are not successful,‚Äù he claimed.Last year, various government agencies, including Delhi government and municipal bodies, carried out test runs for anti-smog guns. However, Sushant Saini of Cloud Tech, an environmental management company that had carried out a demonstration at Anand Vihar in 2017, said, ‚ÄúMost orders are from the private sector and very few government agencies have come forward. An average anti-smog gun costs around Rs 5 lakh.‚ÄùThe technology has improved in the past few years and more orders are coming now, Saini added. He admitted that cheaper Chinese versions did pose a threat. ‚ÄúEvery mist producing machine can‚Äôt be called an anti-smog gun. Cheap quality alternatives from China are being used to just meet compliance. Agencies ensuring compliance should fix standards that can be measured during checks,‚Äù Saini pointed out.Green Genra Technologies in Okhla started manufacturing anti-smog guns this year and has received 10 orders. Mridul Maurya, its director, said, ‚ÄúOur main customer base is Delhi-NCR. We are selling models, covering 25-100m radius, starts from Rs 3 lakh.‚ÄùPointing out that the cost difference with Chinese products is a lot, he said, ‚ÄúWe have not seen what kind of quality they are offering.‚Äù",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77699618,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-306716,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cheap-china-models-a-bother-for-smog-gun-startups/articleshow/77697962.cms
150,['23/08/2020'],"‚ÄòStarving‚Äô and sick, five-year-old dies in UP","Family of the deceased

AGRA: For about a month, the Singhs at Nagla Vidhichand village in Agra‚Äôs Baroli Ahir block had gone without work. For over a week, their family went without food. And on Friday night, their daughter, five-year-old Sonia died, hungry and sick.

‚ÄúI failed her,‚Äù said Sheela Devi, her 40-year-old mother who has been looking for a job, any job, to feed her family. ‚ÄúI could not get her any food. She had been growing weak. She had a fever for three days. And now, I have lost her.‚Äù On Friday night, they buried the child. Hemant Gautam, a neighbour who helped the family with the burial, said local authorities did nothing to help families like theirs secure food in the lockdown-induced crisis.

On Saturday, the district administration said it will find out where things went wrong. ‚ÄúWe have taken cognizance of the matter. An investigation has been ordered into the child‚Äôs death,‚Äù said district magistrate Prabhu N Singh. ‚ÄúThe family buried the body, which they should not have done. A postmortem would have ascertained the cause of death.‚Äù

But the indicators of starvation death have always been difficult to pin down. For years, the problem with acknowledging such deaths has been just that ‚Äî the signs show up slowly and manifest as separate ailments. ‚ÄúStarvation first leads to dehydration, then the glucose level rapidly decreases. The body passes into hypoglycemia (low blood sugar ) and hypovolemia (loss of blood volume). Starvation also causes electrolyte imbalance. After all this, following exhaustion, a person who has been starving usually dies of cardiorespiratory arrest,‚Äù said Dr Sharad Gupta, an Agra-based physician and social worker.

To Sheela and her husband, Pappu Singh, a 45-year-old daily wager, what happened to their daughter is a tragic reminder of the circumstances in 2016, right after demonetisation, when they had lost their son, Rohit, after running out of money. Sheela, meanwhile, is worried about her husband now. Pappu was diagnosed with tuberculosis and has been bed-ridden. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt afford his medicines. I don‚Äôt know what to do,‚Äù Sheela said.

The roof of the 400-square foot run down house has been leaking, like it does every monsoon. Power supply was snapped a year ago when they could not pay the bills. They never had a phone ‚Äî it‚Äôs too expensive. And the lockdown made things even more difficult. ‚ÄúWe had been surviving by asking people for food. But for the past 10 days, we couldn't manage even that. We don‚Äôt have a ration card and did not get any help during lockdown,‚Äù said Pooja, Sonia‚Äôs 16-year-old sister.

The unaddressed gap in access to basics appears to have been the norm for Dalit families in Nagla Vidhichand, those in the village said. ‚ÄúThere are 274 poor Dalit families in the village who do not have ration cards. I had forwarded their applications but those at the subdivision office never acted. I will try and help in my personal capacity,‚Äù said gram pradhan Rajendra Singh.

On Saturday afternoon, secretary of Congress‚Äôs UP unit Amit Singh visited the family. ‚ÄúThey are in urgent need of assistance. No ration card, no gas connection ‚Äî they didn‚Äôt even get the Rs 1,000 that had been promised to daily wage labourers by the state government,‚Äù he said. The district magistrate said help is on its way: ‚ÄúIt is true they are suffering. I will ensure all possible help is provided to the family.‚Äù

NEW DELHI: With the air pollution season just a couple of months away, South Delhi Municipal Corporation has ordered its executive and assistant engineers to initiate action against the big construction sites , which have not yet deployed anti-smog guns.

A senior corporation official said that a meeting in this regard was held by the additional commissioner and area engineers have been asked to prepare a report on the deployment of anti-smog guns at large construction sites. ‚ÄúAccording to an order issued by SDMC on February 20, 2020, such anti-smog guns are mandatory at sites, which are larger than 20,000 sqm and less than 1.50 lakh sqm. The lockdown period caused some delay, but now action will be initiated against owners of construction sites if they do not comply,‚Äù added the official.

The engineers have been asked to prepare a list of all the project sites in their respective jurisdictions and the number of smog guns deployed at each of them. ‚ÄúA report is to be submitted in the court. Engineers are directed to ensure guidelines are met failing which action will be initiated,‚Äù the order stated.

An SDMC engineer said that reports of only five construction sites with smog guns in south Delhi areas have been received so far. ‚ÄúTwo of these construction sites are located in Dwarka under Najafgarh zone, while three others in Central zone. Instructions have been given from the headquarters, but no notices have been issued so far,‚Äù the official added.

Last year, the apex court had directed the use of anti-smog guns in Delhi and other NCR areas for large construction sites, road construction stretches, mining activities, large parking sites on unpaved areas and during large public gatherings and demolition activities. ‚ÄúIt be made compulsory to make use of anti-smog guns in Delhi-NCR in projects that require environmental clearance from the State/Central level and which have a built-up area of more than 20,000 sqm, including excavation, material handling and other dust-generating activities. Let an appropriate policy decision be also taken with respect to cost of installation, duly considering the principle ‚Äòpolluters pay‚Äô evolved by this court,‚Äù the bench had said.

While some experts have raised doubts over the efficacy of anti-smog guns, the top court had junked the intervention application by a Delhi-based doctor, who doubted the efficiency of these towers in the backdrop of limited research data.

152,['23/08/2020'],"Congress targets Jyotiraditya Scindia, stages protest ahead of BJP campaign","Congress activists take part in a protest against BJP in Gwalior on Saturday (PTI)

BHOPAL: Hours before BJP‚Äôs mega membership drive in Gwalior, Congress on Saturday displayed its show of strength in an area where BJP Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia wields influence.

Hundreds of Congress workers hit the roads in Gwalior to protest the BJP‚Äôs membership drive amid the Covid-19 scare. Former ministers Lakhan Singh, Bhagwan Singh Yadav and Balendu Shukla courted arrest. Police arrested hundreds of Congress workers and local leaders who were later released.

Sixteen of the 27 assembly seats going for the upcoming bypolls fall in the Gwalior-Chambal region. It is here that chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar, state BJP chief V D Sharma and Scindia are scheduled to spend the next three days to mobilise party workers and lead a massive membership drive.

But Congress is not willing to give the ruling party a cakewalk. The PCC claimed that the protests proved that Congress is not run by Scindia in the Gwalior region. Former MP Ram Sevak Singh told the media, ‚ÄúWhen Scindia was in the Congress party, I was with him. But Congress cannot be weakened because someone has chosen to leave. The protest is Congress workers‚Äô rage against traitors. We will win all the 27 seats in the bypolls.‚Äù

Even before the BJP leaders could reach Gwalior on Saturday, state Congress workers gathered at Shinde Ki Chavni area to protest. With a three-layered security arrangement, police barricaded the area from Phool Bagh Maidan to Shibde Ki Chavni as Congress under the leadership of local leaders marched in huge numbers with black flags. The protest, however, broke all norms of social distancing.

Former minister and state Congress vice-president Shukla said, ‚ÄúDoes BJP want to contain the Covid pandemic or help it spread? Congress party wanted to peacefully hold a demonstration at the foot of the Mahatma Gandhi statue. But cops stopped us on the road while BJP has called its workers from Bhind, Datia, Morena and all across the Chambal region. What corona protocol will be maintained when their crowds reach the city? And why blame us when they started it all.‚Äù

Congress‚Äôs media in-charge in Gwalior-Chambal, K K Mishra alleged, ‚ÄúThe administration speaks of safety guidelines on Covid. If the virus spreads in Gwalior region then it will be none other than the administration and police who will be responsible. How did they give BJP the permission for such a function? ‚Äù

As Congress workers gathered in the area at around 11am, there were exchanges of fisticuffs with cops. The leaders, including Ram Sevak Singh, district party president Devendra Sharma and hundreds of workers were arrested.

State Congress spokesman Durgesh Sharma said, ‚ÄúThe protests registered by Congress workers in Gwalior was a message for Scindia. The message was that no one in the Congress party is a bonded labourer. Those who had to leave, have left. We have shown Scindia that Congress made him, he didn‚Äôt make the party.‚Äù

‚ÄúCongress workers showed Scindia their true power and that they stand with the leadership. The entire country has seen that Congress cannot be shaken,‚Äù Sharma added.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Development Authority‚Äôs landpooling project may soon see work for the model sectors begin in three zones, as the agency said that it has received a good response.

So far, DDA claims to have pooled 6,575 hectares of land and sectors in zones N, P-II and L may soon be qualify for the policy. These model sectors will set the template for other locations where DDA will play the role of facilitator instead of developer.

A senior DDA official said that a total of 6,219 applications have been registered and 1,371 applications have already been verified by the revenue department of Delhi government.

The landpooling policy is applicable for the urban extension areas of Delhi, comprising 95 villages falling in zones J, K-I, L, N and P-II. The entire area has been divided in to 109 sectors. On an average, each sector is about 250 to 350 hectares, and is anticipated to accommodate about 80,000 to 1 lakh people.

A DDA official explained that for a sector to qualify for development, a minimum of 70% contiguous land in a sector is required to be pooled. Of the pooled land, the developer will retain 60% for development of residential, commercial, public and semi-public facilities while the remaining 40% will be utilised by DDA for development of city infrastructure.

The official said that the rest of the applications are being scrutinised. ‚ÄúDDA is mapping the pooled land on a GIS platform to ascertain the eligibility of sectors, which will be verified by Delhi government,‚Äù he said. The landpooling policy allows residential FAR of 200 and 15% additional FAR for development of EWS housing.

DDA has developed a web portal for expression of willingness regarding participation in landpooling which was launched last year.

In the incident which took place in January, complainant Sagar Bhalara, said he got a call from prime accused Prakash Desani, who identified himself as ‚Äòpolice sub inspector Jadeja‚Äô of Rajkot crime branch.

The cheating complaint was submitted to cyber crime department in February. After investigation, cyber crime cops found out at it was actually a case of cheating and transferred the complaint to Lodhika police station for further investigation on Friday.

According to cops, accused had told Bhalara that his family had met with an accident in Udaipur of Rajasthan and they need immediate money. He asked Bhalara to ask his distributor in Udaipur to provide them with Rs 30,000 immediately.

Bhalara did as was directed and when his distributor went to give the amount, he met two women who identified themselves as Reshma Kodia, a resident of Dhrangadhra and Binal Patel, a resident of Mehsana. The duo demanded Rs 25,000 more from the distributor who paid them that amount too. Desani then called Bhalara again and assured him of returning the money to his office in Rajkot.

A few days later, Bhalara called up Desani and the two women whom his distributor had paid the money to in Udaipur but did not get replies and a few days later their phones were switched off. He then tried to contact ‚ÄòPSI Jadeja‚Äô in the crime branch though other sources but found out that there is nobody working here with that name. Knowing that he had been duped, Bhalara approached the cyber crime department in February.

Cyber Crime cops found out that Prakash Desani is a resident of Limdi, while Reshma is the wife of one Hidayat Kodia. The other two accused, Binal Patel and Kisan Desani, are residents of Surendrangar and are also part of the conspiracy.

AHMEDABAD: Ex-IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt has approached the Gujarat high court seeking directions that the trial court in Palanpur should adjourn proceedings till the physical opening of the court on various applications that are being heard in connection with the 1996 drug planting case.

The trial court in Palanpur rejected a request by Bhatt and decided to continue hearing miscellaneous applications through video conferencing. Bhatt had insisted that due to voluminous record, lengthy arguments are not possible in the virtual proceedings and the hearings on these applications should take place in open court physically.

The applications , which Bhatt insisted should not be heard through video, include one filed under Section 319 of IPC seeking to treat certain witnesses as accused citing their involvement in the alleged offence and an application by a co-accused, I B Vyas, proposing to turn an approver.

Upon Bhatt‚Äôs lawyer insisting on delay for these applications, the state government submitted that Bhatt would seek bail on the ground of delay. To this, Bhatt‚Äôs advocate Saurin Shah submitted that Bhatt is lodged behind bars and he would not be interested in delay. Moreover, Bhatt would give an undertaking that he would not seek bail on the ground of delay in hearing these applications.

The HC has posted hearing on August 26, when the lawyer is expected to place on record Bhatt‚Äôs undertaking that he would not seek bail for the delay caused due to his insistence on physical hearing.

Bhatt was arrested in this case in September 2018 on allegations of attempt to frame a Rajasthan-based advocate, Sumersingh Rajpurohit, in a false narcotics case. This was allegedly done to pressurize him to vacate a commercial property in Pali town of Rajasthan.

164,['23/08/2020'],100% jump in sweet biz; flower sales shoot up,"Kolkata: As the lockdown lifted on Friday night, workers at sweet factories and workshops swung into action to ready thousands of kilograms of laddus and modaks‚Äîthe two ‚Äúfavourites‚Äù of Ganesha‚Äîso that on Saturday, there was no dearth of offerings during the Ganesh Chaturthi pujas.

Most sweet shops opened shutters by 5am, while Kumartuli and Jagannath as well as Mullick Ghat were abuzz with activities from the crack of dawn as last-minute purchase of idols and flowers began.

Though sweet shops did brisk business throughout Saturday, the owners rued they lost out on sales on locked down Thursday and Friday; traditionally, at least 90% laddus and modaks were sold the days before Ganesh Chaturthi. However, the huge demand drove up sales on Saturday, leading to over 100% jump in business, with most shops running out of stock by early evening. They had to start production all over again. ‚ÄúDespite the lockdown, orders came pouring in online and we also took orders on phone. It looked quite daunting when we started work at 10pm on Friday night. Laddus were popular for years but modaks have become a craze for the past five years or so. Apart from traditional modaks made of rice flour and grated coconut, we have experimented with myriad flavours,‚Äù said Sudip Mullick of Balaram Mullick . The popularity of modaks, a Maharashtrian favourite, has caught on with customers in the city so much that most traditional Bengali sweet shops are selling them now. ‚ÄúWe, too, made modaks in more than 10 flavours and experimented with fillings. Those sold more than laddus this time,‚Äù said Tapan Das of Nalin Chandra Das.

The Haldiram‚Äôs store near Rabindra Sadan saw brisk sales, too, but owner Avni Agarwal rued that stocks could not be given to many distributors on the city fringes owing to the lockdown days before that. ‚ÄúUsually, the two days prior to Chaturthi sees 60% sales of laddus alone. We made up for that on Saturday though,‚Äù she said.

The flower market at Mullick Ghat below Howrah bridge teemed with people since early in the morning. While many people bought the idols on Wednesday, flowers couldn‚Äôt be stored three days in advance. ‚ÄúWe will be going to Kumartuli to buy the idol after purchasing flowers. It is going to be a very basic affair this time without relatives joining in,‚Äù said Puja Rajgaria, a resident of Kankurgachhi.

NEW DELHI: To minimise incidents of trees falling during rain , New Delhi Municipal Council‚Äôs horticulture department has initiated a drive to identify hanging or dead branches , which restrict visibility on roads, and prune them. This also includes finding trees damaged by insects.

‚ÄúWe do deep pruning of trees from November after taking permission from the forest department. Tress leaning on one side and uneven branches hamper overall growth,‚Äù an official said, while giving details of the yearlong exercise.

However, except for NDMC , none of the other three civic agencies ‚Äî north, south and east corporations ‚Äî make specific action plans for pruning of trees and, an official said, the process was ‚Äúrequirement based‚Äù. While mild pruning is good for the health of trees and can minimise incidents of falling, lack of staff, delay in permission and objections by people makes it a cumbersome exercise, the official added.

‚ÄúWe do pruning for the first 2-3 years, when the trees are young. Our staff strength is just around 60% and it not possible to visit grown trees unless people report issues,‚Äù said an EDMC official.

An SDMC official said people want trees to be pruned in winter to get sunlight. ‚ÄúBut there are others who are against pruning. Added to this is the long procedure in getting permission from the forest department, which requires filling a form, clicking pictures of trees, getting signatures of residents, etc,‚Äù he added.

Residents, however, had mixed opinions on this issue. While some believed that pruning was a must for ensuring long life of trees and reducing accidents, others said this exercise was often misused and healthy trees were cut.

MK Gupta, president of GK S-Block RWA, got six out of 20 trees pruned after pursuing the matter with the corporation for 15 days. ‚ÄúIn our area, trees have a height of nearly 50 feet, which restricts air flow. The trees along the nullah are bent on one side and can get uprooted any time. I had even taken up the matter with the forest department to get the task done,‚Äù he said.

Environment lawyer Aditya Prasad said the situation wouldn‚Äôt arise if the corporation carried out pruning round the year. ‚ÄúMost trees fall because of excessive lopping or concretisation. The pruning guidelines issued by the forest department are only followed by the corporations under pressure. Tenders are given to contractors, who often cut in excess to get additional wood. The tree authority formed under Delhi Preservation of Trees Act has not acted in years,‚Äù he added.

A senior official from the forest department, however, said they always revert to the corporations regarding deep pruning of trees within seven days. ‚ÄúWe either give them permission after a survey of the area or demand more documents within seven days, so there‚Äôs no question in delaying sanction of permission. In fact, there have been instances where we have granted approval to the corporations, but local residents continue to pursue us for updates,‚Äù he added.

Bhavreen Kandhari, a resident of Defence Colony and an environmentalist, said that it was a ‚Äúmyth‚Äù that deep pruning of trees was needed to keep them healthy or increase their life. ‚ÄúIn urban areas, deep pruning only benefits people. They want to cut trees because falling leaves and flowers make a mess. Even civic agencies do the work thoughtlessly. To conduct the exercise, we need proper equipment and knowledgeable people,‚Äù she added.

These four include the alleged supplier of the firearms, the person who provided logistics support and two who allegedly financed the alleged attempt.

Though the assignments are not going to affect their marks, students are still supposed to submit them. Exams for these subjects will be conducted later. The Bar Council of India had recently released a directive in this regard.

Why has the university decided to inform us about the assignments at the last moment?, rue students.

The student union of the campus law centre has questioned the need for the assignments when exams are to be conducted later.

Shivank Trivedi, vice-president of the student union, said, ‚ÄúThe notification released on Thursday states that the assignments will neither be marked nor affect the percentage. Exams for the respective subjects will be conducted later when possible. In such a scenario, asking the students to submit the assignments makes little sense.‚Äù

The circular of the law faculty earlier stated, ‚ÄúHowever, it is to be clearly understood that the submission of this assignment is a requirement was a promotion only and will not affect your marks percentage in the LLB course. As for the direction of the VC in the above-mentioned letter dated June 9, you will have to appear in the end-term examination to be conducted by the university as per the practical feasibility and also clear all subject papers with the investment period of the LLB course.‚Äù

The online method of submission is not feasible for many of us, say the students.

‚ÄúWe have been continuously pointing out that the online method of submission is not feasible for a large number of students.

176,['23/08/2020'],Puja mantra: Smaller Durga idols in spacious pandals,"Kolkata: The pandemic may have dealt a blow to the larger-than-life sizes of Durga idols this year, but the stature remains undiminished.

Barring the big Pujas, most organizers have brought down the deity ‚Äôs size to eight to 10ft from 14ft to 16ft for reasons, varying from logistic convenience to budget restrictions, from creating more space inside pandals for social distancing to keeping it minimal this time.

Members of Puja committees said this was a reverse trend because the height and form of idols had been increasing with every Durga Puja to add grandeur and splendour, but this year, the pandemic had forced them to restrict the size. ‚ÄúWe have had no option but to maintain austerity. We had to go in for a smaller idol this year for several reasons. The height of the pandal has been reduced and the idol has to be proportionate to it. At the same time, we will have to keep more space inside the pandal for the movement of people so that social distancing can be maintained,‚Äù said Somnath Das, secretary Santoshpur Lakepally.

Forum for Durgotsab, an association of all major Durga Pujas in and around Kolkata, has issued a list of safety guidelines for this year‚Äôs celebrations, urging all committees to reduce the size of the deity this year. ‚ÄúDurga Puja is the biggest festival for us and people from all walks of life wish to visit pandals and admire the skills of the craftsmen. But the situation this year demands that we stick to all the safety guidelines so that that the virus does not spread,‚Äù said Saswata Basu, secretary of the Forum for Durgotsab.

Organisers also feel smaller idols would be convenient to transport to pandals, set them up inside and then, take them for immersion. ‚ÄúSmaller idols do not require too many people for transportation to pandals and later, to the immersion ghats,‚Äù said a committee member of the Mohmmad Ali Park Puja committee.

According to Shankar Pal, an artisan in the potters‚Äô enclave in Kumartuli, last year, a Durga idol of 12 ft, along with the idols of her fanily, was sold for Rs1.5 lakh. Now, the same organization wanted to buy the idol of a much smaller size at Rs 40,000, he said. The reduced prices are a matter of concern, given that Kumartuli artisans depend on Durga Puja to earn a living to help them sustain through the rest of the year.

The pandemic has also led to shortage in manpower in the hub. ‚ÄúWe are working with an acute shortage of artists and labourers. Most of our labourers have gone back to their villages. With uncertainty looming large, many don‚Äôt want to return. We started receiving bookings quite late and Puja organisers are asking for smaller idols at half the price they used to pay even last year,‚Äù said Apurba Pal, general secretary of Kumartuli Clay Artists‚Äô and Artisans‚Äô Association.

In comparison, the DO levels ‚Äî essential for sustaining aquatic life in the river ‚Äî were 0 mg/l when the readings were taken in February.Similarly, Coloured Dissolved Organic Matter showed a 75% reduction during this period. Priyank Hirani, team head at the Water-to-Cloud Project, said two boat rides were taken on February 12 and February 13, collecting 1,824 data points in the process. From May to June, three boat rides were taken (May 22, May 27 and June 5) which saw 1,868 data points being collected.Hirani said while in February, the DO levels ranged between 0 and 2.17 mg/l and had a median value of 0 mg/l; it improved to 2.31 to 9.16 mg/l in May-June, with a median value of 2.82 mg/l.‚ÄúWhile it did rain on June 4, which may have helped the river clean up, 1,232 data points collected on May 22 and May 27 ranged the DO levels between 2.31 and 7.92 mg/l.

Fumigation using ‚Äò Ayurveda dhoopnam ‚Äô prepared by Dr Anilan S , medical officer , Government Ayush Primary Health Centre , Kottukal , is said to reduce bacterial and fungal infection in the disinfected area.

Dr Anilan prepared the fu migation powder, Aparajitha Dhooma Choornam, with reference from texts on Ayurveda. The doctor and his team then experimented it at Kottukal panchayat for 15 days during the Covid outbreak in April-May, distributing it to around 1,000 houses. ‚ÄúWe noticed that after each day, bacterial, fungal and other infectious species reduced drastically in the region. And after 15 days of regular fumigation, aerobic bacterial count, yeast and mould count were nil,‚Äù the doctor said.

He later used the choornam at Covid first-line treatment centre at Kovalam when he was assigned duty there.

Dr Anilan said Ayurveda gave much importance to preventive medicine and it has described several modes for disinfection purposes. ‚ÄúFumigation (dhoopana) with medicinal herbs is one such method that is safe, natural and cost effective. In addition to disinfection, the fumes from herbal plants are good for stress relief and well-being,‚Äù Dr Anilan said.

‚ÄúAnyone can make the Aparajitha Dhooma Choornam at home with prescribed ingredients. Panchayat and ward representatives can take initiatives to carry out fumigation using this drug at junctions and streets in mornings and evenings. It will be effective when the fumigation is done at the same time every day. It is available in some dispensaries at Rs 35 per 50 grams,‚Äù Dr Anilan said.

The rhizome of Acorus Calamus (Vayambu), Actiniopteris Dichotoma plant (Nanmukha Pullu), wood part of Aquilaria Agallocha (Agaru), bark and leaves of Azadirachta Indica (Veppu), root of Calotropis Gigantea (Erukku), wood part of Cedrus Deodara (Devedaram), gum resin of Commiphora Mukul (Gulggulu) and resin of Shorea Robusta, (Chenchallyam) are used to make the powder. The powder can be added to a heated coconut shell in an earthen vessel. The fumes emitting from the mixture is used for fumigation.

The doctor said powder can be used for disinfecting rooms and environment; controlling pests, rodents and insects; purifying and sterilising therapeutic rooms, puerperal and neonatal rooms; administrated as drug for wounds, fever, poisoning, ENT diseases, gynaecological and psychological disorders and disinfecting vessels used for medicine preparation.

PUNE: Water stock in Ujani, the largest dam in the Bhima basin in terms of storage, surged beyond 70% on Saturday, adding over 33 TMC in the last 20 days after water was released from many upstream dams located in Pune district.

Ujani has a total storage capacity of 56 TMC live stock and 59 TMC dead stock. On Saturday, the water storage reached up to 39 TMC, adding over 33 TMC water from August 1, when the reservoir‚Äôs storage was around 6 TMC.

Rise in storage will ensure adequate supply of water to the areas of Pune, Solapur district and agriculture activities in both districts, an official from the irrigation department said.

The officials from the state irrigation department said water levels of Ujani were rising continuously for the last two weeks. The dam has received water discharge from Khadakwasla, Mulshi, Panshet, Vir and other dams. Last year, the stock in the dam had reached its full capacity by the end of August. This year too, the water level may reach 100% if the reservoir continues to receive similar inflow of water, officials said.

However, the water discharge from Khadakwasla and Panshet was stopped on Saturday afternoon after the intensity of rain in the catchments of both dams reduced.

An official from the state irrigation department said, ‚ÄúWe had initiated water release from Khadakwasla and Panshet at the rate of 13,000 cusec and 4,000 cusec, respectively, on Saturday morning. By afternoon, the discharge from both dams was pulled down to zero because Khadakwasla did not record any rainfall on Saturday, while Panshet recorded 7mm. The discharge will resume if rainfall activity in catchments intensifies,‚Äù an official said.

Water release from Khadakwasla was stopped after almost a week.

The state irrigation department continued with the release of water from Mulshi dam at 7,500 cusec. The collective stock in the four dams ‚Äî Khadakwasla, Panshet, Varasgaon and Temghar ‚Äî reached 28 TMC (96%) by Saturday evening.

Water stock in 10 out of 25 dams in the Bhima basin reached its full capacities on Saturday. The dams included Bhatghar, Panshet, Kalmodi, Andra, Vir, Khadakwasla, Mulshi, Nazare, Gunjawani and Nira Devghar.

Boil water before consumption: PMC

The PMC‚Äôs water supply department has appealed to citizens to boil and filter PMC-supplied tap water before consumption. The administration said it was getting muddy water via the water pipeline coming from Khadakwasla because of increased rainfall in the dam‚Äôs catchments, which was released into river. ‚ÄúThe water is being treated and purified at the treatment and purification plant and is fit for consumption.

The Gangapur Dam, which is located upstream of the Nashik city and supplies drinking water, has 93% water in store. As per the reservoir operation plan, the WRD must maintain certain levels of water considering the copious rain in the catchment areas of the dams.

If there are more heavy showers, the WRD will be compelled to release water. This could cause flooding in the low-lying areas along the river ‚Äî most of them in Nashik city and in the twin village Saikheda and Chandori in Niphad taluka.

‚ÄúWe have alerted the local civic bodies and have asked them to ensure that people do not go near the Godavari,‚Äù district collector Suraj Mandhare said.

The administration has prepared a district flood action plan in which the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has been given the responsibility of raising awareness among the people living along the banks, and also keeping an evacuation plan ready for the vulnerable population living along the banks. The plan includes rehabilitation while maintaining Covid-19 protocol, besides ensuring medical supplies for the people in the temporary camps if and when required.

While the WRD has been asked to stay in touch with the district authorities and alert them if water has to be released from any of the dams, the district collectorate also has the responsibility to ensure people‚Äôs safety through its tahsildars, especially in Nashik and Niphad talukas.

In the case of Nashik city, the district disaster management authority (DDMA) has in place nearly 12 volunteers, besides 10 volunteers of the Bhonsala Adventure Foundation and about 15 of Vainteya Girbhraman Sanstha (organization of trekkers) who are ready to help the administration in relief and rescue operations.

NEW DELHI: The doctors at a city private hospital recently removed a 50kg tumour from the ovary of a woman. The woman , 52, weighed 106 kg before surgery and after the surgery her weight came down to 56 kg, doctors said.

‚ÄúIn over 30 years of my experience as a surgeon, I have never come across a case where a tumour weighed almost half the person‚Äôs body weight. Previously, the largest case was in 2017 from Coimbatore where a lady was operated for a 34-kg tumour in her ovary,‚Äù Dr Arun Prasad, senior consultant for surgical gastroenterology and bariatric surgery at Apollo hospital said.

He said the woman, identity withheld, was diagnosed with tumour in the ovary about five months ago. However, due to the lockdown she delayed the surgery. ‚ÄúThe cause of the tumour isn‚Äôt known. Also, luckily for the woman, she did not have any life-threatening complications in the five months when the tumour was progressively expanding in her ovary even as it put pressure on her intestine and other organs,‚Äù Dr Prasad said.

She recently started having difficulty in breathing, acute pain in her lower abdomen and consequently problems in walking and sleeping, the Apollo doctor said, adding that this prompted her to seek surgery.

It took nearly three and a half hours for the team of surgeons to extract the 50-kg tumour from the ovary. Dr Prasad said extraction of the tumour was a challenge for the team especially because the patient had exceptionally low haemoglobin and had to undergo in total six units of blood transfusion before, during and after the procedure.

‚ÄúThis procedure was a perfect example of how important it is to understand the traditional methods of surgery while evolving with new minimal access procedures, the doctor said. Here, there was no space in the abdomen for insertion of equipment via laparoscopy or robot-assisted methods, hence we had to resort to traditional methods of surgery. With the combined effort of experts from the gastroenterology, gynaecology and anaesthesiology teams, the extraction was done successfully,‚Äù the doctor said.

Dr Geeta Chadha, senior consultant, gynaecology and obstetrics at Apollo hospital said there is no proven reason for the emergence of a tumour in the ovary, but it can happen during the formation of the cells in a human body.

As the first-ever case of a 50-kg tumour in the ovary, this was a challenging procedure. Due to the giant tumour, the intestinal tract was compressed and flattened which was putting pressure on the gut leading to a risk of rupture in the ovary, Dr Chadha said.

‚ÄúThe surgery had to be done with utmost precision, keeping in mind seamless extraction of the tumour and simultaneously ensuring no harm is caused to the ovary or the gut. Post-surgery the patient showed tremendous recovery and is set to be discharged on Saturday evening,‚Äù she said.

Addressing the event, Nitish said the state government‚Äôs programme to provide electricity connection to all households under the ‚ÄòHar Ghar Bijli Lagataar‚Äô programme ended in October, 2018, two months prior to the deadline for completing the project. All rickety wires across the state were replaced by the end of December, 2019.

‚ÄúNow, I wish that all consumers must be provided prepaid meters so that the frequent complaints regarding over-billing becomes a thing of the past. Once, a prepaid meter is installed, people will use electricity as per their requirement and recharge in advance like they do for their prepaid mobile phone connection.

He further said there would be no curtailment in subsidy being provided to electricity consumers despite adverse economic situation due to Covid-19 pandemic in state. ‚ÄúOur government will continue providing subsidies and all other facilities to the consumers despite adverse scenarios prevailing in the state due to Covid-19,‚Äù he said.

Amid curbs announced during Ganesh festival this year by district administration, the number of public Ganesh mandals celebrating the annual festival has also gone down.

Besides, Ganesh mandals have been specifically asked to keep thermal guns and pulse oxymeters with them for regular screening of volunteers as well as devotees among other key instructions from the local civic body which has already denied permission to processions during the beginning or the concluding of the festival.

206,['23/08/2020'],Official apathy stalls development under Mewat area board,"Jaipur: The Mewat Area Development Board ( MADB ) meant for the socio-economic upliftment of the Meo Muslim community in Alwar and Bharatpur has been awaiting its board chairman for the past 12 years.

The MADB was allocated Rs 300 crore budget for five years in 2015 for filling the infrastructure gaps which were supposed to be completed by 2020. Many of these projects are yet to see the light of the day due to administrative and political apathy.

The MADB was formed in 1987. It is spread across two districts and has a total of 799 villages dominated by Meo Muslim community. Or villages whose 40% and above population belongs to them. The programme aimed at building infrastructure, sanitation, health, rural connectivity, education and medical facilities. The zila parishads of Alwar and Bharatpur have been made the nodal agency to oversee the programme, while the MLAs and MPs have been made part of the governing committees.

Pointing at the shortcomings of the administration, Sher Mohammed, a community leader, blamed the poor execution of the programme to meet its desired result on political and administrative apathy. ‚ÄúIn the absence of the board members and a chairman, the work is being carried by the respective MLAs under the MLA LAD fund as per the provision. In the previous regime, the designated MLAs have carried out developmental projects in non-Meo areas while flouting the basic criteria of ignoring the Meo-dominated areas,‚Äù said Mohammed, who accused the MLAs of preventing the government from appointing a board chairman which will reduce the role of these elected representatives. The MLA LAD fund for every MLA is Rs 2.25 crore, while it gives them additional fund under the scheme for Meos.

Reacting to the allegations of misuse of funds, former MLA Tijara Maman Singh Yadav who constituency has 131 villages under MADB, says, ‚ÄúMeo area development means the development of an entire area or region. It doesn‚Äôt mean funds were only for a particular community. I must have done the welfare work of Rs 50-60 crores under the MADB from 2015-2018,‚Äù said Yadav, who claimed that his party has spent around Rs 290 crore against Rs 300 crore budget.

On the contrary to the claims made by the former MLA, the Mewat guidelines 2015 describes Mewat area as 799 villages spread in 11 Panchayat Samitis . Also, an official of the rural development and Panchayati Raj says that amount spent in the last five years was less than 50%.

Like BJP, the Congress government too was not able to spend much on the development of Meos since they came to power. ‚ÄúSince the first year of our rule had Lok Sabha elections followed by local polls. Now, the Covid-19 situation has eaten almost the first half of this financial year is a reason that only a fraction of a budget has been utilised. Once the situation is normal, the work will be completed in fast pace,‚Äù said Shafia Zubair, MLA Ramgarh in Alwar.

Sources said that out of the earmarked 799 villages, barely 200 have got projects. The project was divided into two phases: In the first phase, the developmental work was to be carried out in villages with population below 5,000 and in the second phase villages with population above 5,000.

However, even the first phase remains incomplete. Bina Gupta, chairperson of Alwar Municipal Council, said that they are fully aware of the pendency of the work under MADB. ‚ÄúOnce the Covid-19 is put under control, the pending work will put on fast track mode,‚Äù Bina said. TOI called up Abhijit Jhatav, chairman of Bharatpur municipal council, for his comments, but he was unavailable.

These market-management committees are expected to bring order in markets as well as eliminate any possibility of conflicts between police and vendors.Deputy commissioner of police Divya V Gopinath said the committees were formed from the idea that handing over the responsibility of enforcing rules to the traders themselves will yield better results. Each committee will be headed by station house officer of local police station. The local leaders of merchants‚Äô associations and select traders from each market will also be members of the committee.‚ÄúEach committee of the respective market will come up with the regulations that have to be followed by the traders there,‚Äô‚Äô the DCP said, adding that the conditions at each market may be different and they all have distinct characters. Hence, trying to enforce same set of regulations in all markets can be foolish. For example, the traders in Chalai have decided among themselves to implement a rotation system for opening shops of different categories to avoid crowding in the market, Divya said.As per the plan, traders can assign volunteers among themselves to see that customers are provided hand sanitizers and social distancing is followed inside the shops. Any offence has to be reported to the station house officer without fail.‚ÄúHaving said so, police will not be handing over the responsibilities completely. The cops too will be regularly inspecting the markets. If they find any violation, strict action will be taken against the volunteers too for failure of reporting the offence,‚Äô‚Äô the DCP said.Now, there are 53 market-managing committees in city limits.

Luckily, there was no untoward incident and before the caving in could get larger in proportion, the civic body officials fixed it. Such incidents of caving in of roads have become a routine affair here as earlier a large portion of the same road had caved in.

The SDO of operation and maintenance cell, Anshul Garcha, who got the road repaired, said that it was only 2-3ft wide and some underground cable was passing under it due to which the portion of the road had got damaged. He said they checked everything and there was no leakage in the water supply line passing below the road. He said they had fixed the problem and now the road pit had been repaired properly.

In the past also, at least four incidents have taken place where road portions have caved in at different locations on this stretch.

NEW DELHI: Delhi‚Äôs education sector is likely to get a major infrastructure boost in the next few years.

Over 100 more schools will be developed as model schools . Several other initiatives, including starting science stream in more schools, developing different classrooms for subjects like physics and chemistry and establishing a science museum-cum-interpretation centre, have been planned. The state government is even mulling starting hydroponics in 10 schools on a pilot basis.

All these plans have been enlisted as part of the Vision-2030 of the Directorate of Education.

So far, 54 schools have been developed as model schools in the capital. These schools are equipped with modern infrastructure and technology.

‚ÄúOn the same lines, 100 new pilot schools are to be started by identifying the school buildings, which are in bad condition,‚Äù mentions the document.

The Public Works Department will be developing these schools.

To give a push to science education, the government aims to start science stream in more schools. At present, it is available in 323 government schools. By August 30, the education department hopes to identify the schools where the science stream will be started. Extra classrooms will be built to start these classes.

Also, different classrooms will be developed for theme-based learning of subjects like physics, chemistry, mathematics and geography.

‚ÄúIdentification of schools for construction of such classrooms can be introduced from the next academic session. The infrastructure required for the construction of the rooms to be finalised by the land and estate branch,‚Äù adds the document.

The government is also planning to establish a science interpretation centre for school children.

‚ÄúA world-class science museum-cum-interpretation centre will be set up for the students to inculcate a better understanding of science and advances in the technology. A meeting of the expert committee will be organised for it by the science branch,‚Äù said an official.

Over why hydroponics is being started in schools, an adviser to the government said, ‚ÄúIt is basically to help students get an understanding of botany as a subject and how plants are grown. A separate infrastructure for it will not be required.‚Äù

Hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil.

212,['23/08/2020'],Why FIR delayed in rape case: Delhi HC,"Delhi high court

NEW DELHI: Coming down heavily on police in a minor rape case , a Delhi court has issued a show-cause notice to an officer asking why he didn‚Äôt register an FIR immediately after receiving the complaint and why proceedings under Protection of Children Against Sexual Offences (Pocso) law shouldn‚Äôt be initiated against him.

‚ÄúPolice have flouted provisions of the Pocso Act, 2012, which mandates a prompt action by police for securing the evidence and ensuring welfare of the child survivor,‚Äù said additional sessions judge Sudhandhu Kaushik.

While issuing notice to the station house officer (SHO) of the police station concerned, the court asked him to explain why shouldn‚Äôt he face action for non-compliance of provision (Section 19 of Pocso Act) of the law that makes it mandatory to register a case immediately and ‚Äúreport the matter to the child welfare committee and the special court‚Äù within 24 hours.

It was seen that though a complaint was made on January 4, 2020, in this case, police did not register the FIR till March 6. ‚ÄúThe SHO is directed to furnish reply (to be forwarded through the concerned DCP) mentioning the reasons as to why he failed to register the FIR immediately despite gaining information that a minor girl had been sexually assaulted,‚Äù the judge ordered.

The direction came during rejection of the anticipatory bail plea of the accused, who was the survivor‚Äôs father. It was alleged that the man had sexually assaulted his six-year-old daughter. The mother noticed that the survivor had become unusually quiet and behaved strangely. She lodged a complaint with police on January 4, and subsequently with the Crime Against Women cell on January 6 after being physically assaulted by her husband.

Although the couple compromised the matter by way of a settlement deed, the mother alleged that the accused continued to sexually assault their daughter on two subsequent occasions.

The accused contested the allegations stating his wife had cheated on him with an ex-employee and framed him in a false case when he confronted her.

The mother‚Äôs counsel and the prosecutor argued that the man‚Äôs plea was not maintainable if the provisions of law relating to rape and the survivor‚Äôs age was considered.

The court underscored the ‚Äúspecific allegations‚Äù in the mother‚Äôs complaint against her husband elaborating penetrative sexual assault by the father on the minor daughter. ‚ÄúI am of the considered opinion that this is not a fit case for exercising the extraordinary discretion of granting anticipatory bail to the accused‚Ä¶ bail application is accordingly dismissed,‚Äù the court held.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

They rued that now they had decided to get the work done on their own, and it has already been started.

They claimed that not only Preet Nagar road but Kakka Dhaula road is also in a pathetic condition. Around two years back construction of that road had been started, but it was left in between. There are so many factories on at Kakka Dhaula road and people going to these factories are facing a tough time.

However, on the other hand, councillor of ward number 15 Kanchan Malhotra said, ‚ÄúSo many illegal colonies are being developed in the ward and adjoining areas and I am trying to provide facilities in these undeveloped areas. These works will be carried out when these illegal areas will be regularised. The proposal to get these areas regularised is lying with authorities concerned and as soon as approval will come, we will start work on sewerage, roads and water supply on priority.‚Äù

220,['23/08/2020'],Workers appointed for filling potholes on Mumbai-Agra highway,"NASHIK: Officials at the Ghoti toll plaza have appointed workers to fill potholes on the Mumbai-Agra highway after several complaints were made by commuters.

Travellers have complained that with the onset of monsoon , the condition of the stretch near Mumbai has started worsening with potholes beginning to emerge.

Harish Chaube, a fire safety officer working at an Igatpuri-based industry, said that he regularly travels on the Mumbai-Agra highway. ‚ÄúThe highway is in a bad shape, especially the stretch from Ghoti Sinnar Junction till Ghatandevi. It has developed huge potholes which are spread till Kasara ghat and even further. Due to these potholes, motorists find it difficult to drive. Also, these potholes lead to accidents during monsoon.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is a common problem faced by travellers on the highway. The authorities concerned should carry out pre-monsoon work on the highway so that such potholes are filled and more do not come up during the monsoon,‚Äù he said.

Meanwhile, commuters faced a tough time travelling on the highway on Friday. Huge rush was witnessed on Friday with people returning to their home towns for Ganeshotsav. With train and bus services shut, a large number of people were seen travelling in their own vehicles, leading to extra rush on the highway.

Prasada was one of the 23 signatories of the recent letter calling for corrective steps in the party. There has been no official word so far from any senior Congress leader in UP. Meanwhile, senior party leader Kapil Sibal has extended support to Prasada through a tweet in which he said, ‚ÄúUnfortunate that Jitin Prasada is being officially targeted in UP"".

On Wednesday, a meeting was held in Kheri where state Congress secretary Kumud Gangwar along with district president Prahlad Patel and other leaders raised slogans against Prasada and allegedly even called him ‚Äúan agent of the opposition party‚Äù. A video of the protest later went viral on social media.

An audio clip, purportedly of Prahlad Patel, went viral on social media in which a voice can be heard saying "" I am ruined"". He then takes the names of some senior functionaries and says that he is ""just a district president"" and was ""made"" to go against Prasada. ""I am being

made the scapegoat,"" the voice says.

When TOI contacted Patel regarding the audio clip, he said, ‚ÄúI am not aware of it. I am a mere district president and follow instructions from the high command and our loyalty is with the Gandhi family. Since the matter is regarding senior leaders of the party, I won‚Äôt be able to comment on it.‚Äù

TOI contacted Prasada but he refused to comment on the issue. However, a source close to Prasada said, ‚ÄúThe protest against Prasada was planted by the party's district unit. Soon the truth will be revealed.‚Äù

Meanwhile, reacting to the resolution passed by the Kheri district unit of the party, Kapil Sibal tweeted: ‚ÄúUnfortunate that Jitin Prasada is being officially targeted in UP. Congress needs to target the BJP with surgical strikes instead of wasting its energy by targeting its own.‚Äù.

Another Congress leader, Manish Tewari, who was also a signatory to the letter, tweeted a single word ‚ÄúPrescient‚Äù.

Prasada represented Shahjahanpur Lok sabha seat in 2004 and Dhaurahra Lok Sabha seat, which is a part of the Lakhimpur Kheri district, in 2009. Recently he has been trying to cultivate an image of a Brahmin leader by raising issues in favour of the caste. Prasada‚Äôs father, Jitendra Prasada, had challenged Sonia Gandhi in the elections for the party presidentship in the late 90s.

Following the railways‚Äô decision, the contractor has planned to remove over 400 trucks out of 500 which are presently operating at the limestone mine owned by Rajasthan State Mines & Minerals (RSMM). In response, the truck union launched a stir and the drivers are on a dharna from the last six days.

On Saturday, a few people allegedly from the truck union, inflicted damage on a few trucks owned by the contractor, following which police arrested the truck union president for disturbing peace. Later, agitated truck drivers of the union ghearoed the police station and expressed their protest. Police later released the truck union president on bail.

The dispute arose over loading charges. On Friday night, the contractor lodged a report with police that damage was caused to his trucks near Mokla on Jaisalmer Road after which Ramgarh SHO arrested Kanwar Raj Singh , president of truck union. Later, a large number of people gathered outside the police station and shouted slogans. Police administration called tehsildar Peetambardas Tathi and Singh was released on bail. Singh the contractor will not be allowed to work arbitrarily and they will fight for their rights.

Former MLA Chotu Singh Bhati said the first right of getting employment at RSMM is of the residents of the district. The contractor will be called and the issue will be settled through talks.

Contractor Mukesh Patel said he is an authorised contractor of RSMM. At present, around 500 trucks carry limestone from Sonu mines to Jaisalmer railway station. In the coming days, goods train will start operating from Sonu railway station and limestone will be loaded from there. Earlier, the limestone was carried for 60km to Jaisalmer railway station , but now the distance will be reduced to 8-10km to Sonu railway station, therefore there will be a need for only 30-40 trucks, but the union is asking to employ all the vehicles, which is not possible. Apart from this, the truck union is demanding Rs 110 per tonne as freight charges from Rs 42 per tonne, which is not possible, he added.

District collector Ashish Modi said former MLA Bhati and the truck union members met him on Saturday. He persuaded the union members to settle the issue through talks.

224,['23/08/2020'],"For Rahon road residents rains brings water-logging, choked sewerage","Ludhiana: Rahon road with a large number of potholes has virtually turned into a swimming pool due to water-logging during this rainy season. The situation is such that when residents drive on this road they get the experience of off-roading.

Municipal corporation officials had got a new sewerage line laid down here to control the problem of water-logging and sewerage choking, but this one is yet to be connected with the main sewerage line. However, the old sewerage line is already overburdened and it is not able to take any further burden of sewer water coming from colonies. When there is heavy rainfall the rain water also adds to the problem. The civic body officials claimed that by next week they would try to make the new line functional and then the issues would be resolved.

A resident of Rahon road, Rahul Kumar, said, ‚ÄúFor almost two years we are living in hell-like situation as this road has never remained dry. The civic body officials tried super suction cleaning and also installed a disposal to drain out water but nothing worked.‚Äù He said now a new sewerage line was laid and the road got damaged, so driving on this road has become very challenging. He claimed that during rainfall one side of the road remains functional, but that was full of potholes, while on the other side there were long queues of vehicles due to traffic jam.

Another resident from Guru Vihar, Rahon road, Gurmeet Singh complained that they were now fed up with the situation here because choking of the sewerage on the main road affected the internal system as well. He said even in the inside areas there was a problem of choked sewerage due to which it had become filthy all around.

Congress councillor from east constituency Sanjay Talwar admitted to the problems being faced by the people but he showed helplessness by saying that every day there was heavy rainfall and it was difficult to work when it was raining. He assured that by next week the entire problem would be resolved as the new sewerage line would be connected with the main sewerage and there would be no choking.

Talwar, however, commented that the presence of a large number of washing and dyeing units along this road had added to the problem as excess water was being drained out through these units. He also held the nearby villages responsible for the situation because those were also connected with Rahon road without any planning.

The MLA added that he had already taken permission for the recarpeting of the road after the sewerage issue was resolved and almost Rs 5 crore had been kept reserved for the purpose.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The mortality rate in the district is now higher than that of the state with 46 deaths officially reported in the district in the last 22 days , including a pregnant woman and her baby.

The district, which had a mortality rate of 0.28% in the first week of August, went above the state‚Äôs rate of 0.3% on Thursday when the rate touched 0.43%. The state capital accounted for 28% of deaths recorded in the state in August.

The youngest of the deceased in the district was a 32-year old pregnant woman who died on August 16. There were two lives ‚Äî the mother and the baby ‚Äî at stake, and eight departments at Medical College Hospital joined hands to save them, but in vain.

She was 29 weeks‚Äô pregnant and had gestational diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism . The woman had two miscarriages before and she was diagnosed with bronchopneumonia and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.

She had to be put on ventilator since her oxygenation status did not improve. With no bystander allowed, the consent was taken over phone for an emergency surgery and it was done in ICU owing to her serious condition. She later developed a renal failure and died two days after the surgery due to multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. ‚ÄúShe really fought hard but the condition was so worse and lungs were severely infected. Her death is a reminder to all of us as to how we should take care of vulnerable people in our family and society,‚Äù said a medical official associated with the treatment team.

The death of the 32-year-old pregnant woman due to complications arising out of Covid-19 has aggravated the challenges before the health team in preventing mortalities among vulnerable groups, especially women requiring antenatal care.

The health officials said many of the Covid-19 deaths have been in the age group above 60 with a 90-year-old woman from Kalady being the oldest Covid-19 victim in the district.

Twenty deaths that occurred in August so far were categorised as non-Covid deaths and there were many cases where the patient was brought dead and then tested positive. While many deaths have occurred in areas marked under community clusters, Covid deaths were also reported from places with nominal number of cases.

The district has 35 people in ICU and their condition is daily monitored by the health team. ‚ÄúGiven the kind of spike, the capital has witnessed in last two months, the mortality rate was bound to increase. Since Thiruvananthapuram has the best healthcare infrastructure in the state and has been picking up positives and isolating infected persons at a faster rate, we have been doing reasonably well in controlling the mortality rate,‚Äù a health official said.

According to a remand report filed by NIA on Friday, they have arraigned Sidhiqul Akbar alias Siddique (A-15) and Ahammed Kutty (A-20) alias Kunjani as accused. Investigators found that the absconding accused were in the UAE.

The remand report added that non-bailable warrants were obtained against them from the special NIA court in Kochi. Earlier, similar warrants were obtained by the agency against Faisal Fareed (A3) and Rabins Hameed (A10). The agency also apprised the court that steps were being taken to issue blue corner notices through Interpol to nab them.

The agency had searched their houses on August 14. The raids were held on the day in six locations at Malappuram and Kozhikode.

The remand report was submitted by the agency when the custody period of accused Mohammed Anwar TM (A16), Hamzath Abdussalam (A17), Samju TM (A18) and Hamjad Ali (A19) expired on Friday.

In the remand report, the agency said that during custodial interrogation the accused disclosed their roles and the roles of other accused in the crime committed with the ‚Äòintention of threatening the economic stability of India.‚Äô They have also disclosed the names of some other conspirators in India and abroad, which is being investigated, NIA said. Sources said that the NIA team, which did investigations in the UAE, has returned. NIA repeated in its report that investigation has to be conducted into roles of high-profile persons and consulate officials as it was necessary to unearth all conspirators in the crime.

Meanwhile, official sources said that ED probing the money trail in the case are in the process of assessing evidence and information to take the next step.

It was stated that the money was part of a kickback received by her in the Life Mission deal with the UAE-based NGO.

As per the MoU inked between Life Mission and UAE Red Crescent Authority, the authority had pledged funds to the tune of 1 crore Arab Emirates Dirhams (AED) (approximately Rs 20.37 crore) for coming up with an apartment project at Wadakkancherry in Thrissur.

The Centre has sought a few clarifications on the mandatory clearance required from the ministry of external affairs and the ministry of home affairs while accepting aid from a foreign agency, it has been learnt.

Government sources said the state government will give a reply in this regard soon.

The agreement signed between Mohamed Ateeq Al Falahi for the UAE Red Crescent Authority and the CEO of the Life Mission on July 11, 2019, had agreed that the NGO will provide 1 crore Arab Emirates Dirhams (AED) of which 70 lakh AED (Rs 14.26 crore) is to be spent on constructing the houses for flood victims, and the remaining 30 lakh AED (Rs 6.11 crore) on the construction of a health centre to be operated by Life Mission.

MEERUT: Weeks after the murder of former BJP district president, police launched a crackdown in Baghpat ‚Äî which witnessed dozens of murders of late giving police sleepless nights ‚Äî and arrested four history-sheeters after encounters in the past three days, while a relative of dreaded gangster Udham Singh with a dozen of cases of heinous crimes registered against him surrendered in the court.

According to police sources, the first encounter took place on Thursday in Baraut, where Pawan Tyagi, a dreaded gangster with more than 30 cases of loot, robbery, murder, extortion, etc, registered against him was arrested and shifted to Baraut Primary Health Centre with injuries.

The next day another encounter took place, followed by yet another one.

According to newly-appointed superintendent of police Abhishek Singh, ‚ÄúWe have deployed a two-pronged strategy ‚Äî identify the criminals or those involved in sinister activities such as liquor smuggling across the border and then find out their source of incomes to break their economic backbone.‚Äù

Western Uttar Pradesh witnessed a spate of murders in the recent past with Baghpat‚Äôs former BJP president Sanjay Khokhar being the third, preceded by Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Deshwal Khokhar‚Äôs murder last month and the killing of Paramvir Tugana, a dreaded criminal out on bail. Tugana had succumbed to his injures at a Delhi hospital.

The latest development, however, was Anuj Barkha's, a cousin of Udham Singh, surrendering in the court on Friday.

‚ÄúBarka is among top ten gangsters in Baghpat. He was wanted in several crimes, including an attempt to murder. Police had been raiding his probable hideouts for some time, but he surrendered in the court,‚Äù said Manish Mishra , Baghpat addition SP.

On Saturday, meanwhile, one more criminal Shubham Jain with 21 cases registered against him was arrested after an encounter. Notably, Jain was the prime accused in the case where two policemen were injured after liquor smugglers tried to crush them under their vehicle when the policemen signalled them to stop near Baghpat‚Äôs Niwada village, close to Haryana border, on August 3.

242,['23/08/2020'],NMC order adds to woes of non-Covid patients,"Nagpur: Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe‚Äôs plan to start treatment for mild to moderate symptomatic Covid-19 patients in around 36 private hospitals has put doctors as well as non-Covid patients in a spot.

In Mundhe‚Äôs August 19 order, 17 private hospitals were told to start Covid treatment. These hospitals having tertiary care facilities and combined capacity of over 1,600 beds currently have over 1,100 patients of cardiac, trauma, dialysis, chemotherapy, angioplasty, angiography, critical obstetrics, brain haemorrhage, neurological and complicated disorders.

On Saturday, another 19 private hospitals claimed they have been asked to start preparing to treat Covid patients, in case needed.

Most of the hospitals have tie-ups with WCL, CGHS and TPA whose beneficiaries can‚Äôt be refused treatment as it may pose legal complications as well. While the hospitals face a stringent administration‚Äôs diktat, the flow of other patients is increasing by the day.

Amid this dilemma, some hospitals have started counselling patients to shift elsewhere, others are reaching out to small hospitals where they can send visiting consultants.

Private hospital owners feel the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) should first fill up all beds in government and its own hospitals to save the city from problems that may arise in future.

Vidarbha Hospitals Association President Dr Ashok Arbat said 50% beds in these private hospitals are occupied. ‚ÄúThese patients can‚Äôt be discharged all of a sudden,‚Äù he said.

Dr Arbat said all beds at GMCH, IGGMCH, Shalinitai Meghe Medical College, Lata Mangeshkar Hospital, NMC-run Indira Gandhi Rughnalaya and four other civic hospitals need to be fully occupied. ‚ÄúIf needed, some of the big hospitals can then be made Covid centres,‚Äù he said.

Though the city has 10,000 beds in all private hospitals, emergency and critical patients are treated at these well-equipped big hospitals. During April and May lockdown phase, the patients either held back their planned procedures or stayed back fearing Covid infection. Now, every hospital is witnessing a steady flow of new and old patients.

Dr Hema Doble, administration head of Suretech Hospitals, said it will be a big problem for beneficiaries of WCL CGHS, TPA. ‚ÄúPeople have already invested for emergencies. Such patients would have walked in without tension and get treated. Now, they will face problems,‚Äù she said.

Dr Doble added the non-Covid patients were already not getting beds. ‚ÄúWhen we start admitting Covid patients, other patients will be fearful,‚Äù she said, adding that there is always government facility for Covid, but this may not be the case for non-Covid.

Suretech has 50 beds and 35 other patients right now. ‚ÄúWe have asked for some time to shift them. But where to shift them is a big question. Others too have been asked to start Covid centres,‚Äù she said.

Lodging and boarding of staff is another concern for these hospitals.

Pulmonologist Dr Vikram Rathi, who is consultant at a private hospital now treating Covid patients, said the NMC‚Äôs directive to convert full hospital as Covid facility is not practical. ‚ÄúOnly 30 to 40% should be Covid beds. NMC asked us to refer non-Covid to concerned specialist. Patients of say diabetes or asthma have long association with their doctor. Sudden cut off will make them feel betrayed or cause emotional changes,‚Äù he said.

Dr Rathi said NMC should be flexible and discuss practical problems with the hospitals‚Äô association.

‚ÄúOne size fits all policy won‚Äôt work,‚Äù he said. Mundhe didn‚Äôt answer to TOI‚Äôs calls.

Problems

* Private hospitals already have pact with WCL, CGHS and TPAs

* Beneficiaries will be forced to pay despite investment or cashless facility

* Bigger issue is once all major private hospitals start Covid, other patients may not find a bed

* 17 private hospitals now asked to start admitting mild to moderate patients have 1,600 beds

* They specialize in cardiac, trauma, NICU, angioplasty, neuro surgery, obstetrics and other disorders

* NMC wants patients under admission now to be referred to specialists

* Treating doctors say patients will feel betrayed

* Hospitals having two units will assign only one for Covid

* Some are making infrastructure modifications

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: On Saturday, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan asked all ministers to work hard among voters to clear the air about recent mala fide campaigns against the government as local body polls were fast approaching.

The CM , while speaking to a group of ministers during a routine review of major projects in their departments, said that an organized campaign ‚Äì triggered by opposition parties against the government ‚Äì has been going on and each leader needs to do his bit to counter that, said sources.

He also suggested to highlight the development and social welfare initiatives of the government, including the progress of Nava Kerala mission schemes to tide over the anti-government campaign.

The government, which faced a series of controversies in the recent past including Sprinklr data sharing, gold smuggling, Life Mission project anomalies and CDR collection of Covid patients, didn‚Äôt get much support from senior LDF leaders, including ministers. The defence mechanism was largely handled by DYFI and SFI leaders.

The meeting convened by the CM also discussed the progress of key projects under various departments. Vijayan directed ministers to prepare a list of projects that could be inaugurated or initiated before the notification for local body polls is issued. The ministers, who are in charge of districts, were asked to coordinate with major local bodies and speed up projects.

The review meeting was originally scheduled on August 18. As seven of the ministers were quarantined following the rescue operation at Karipur, the meeting was rescheduled on Saturday.

It is a bridge between the oxygen mask and the ventilator. And it has been producing much better results in selected patients,‚Äù said senior physician Mukund Penurkar, secretary of the Association of Physicians of India, Pune branch.Analysis of Covid-19 data has revealed that nearly 20% of patients suffered damage to the lungs, which reduced oxygen supply in the body ‚Äî a condition known as hypoxia (breathlessness). Doctors treating this problem rely on oxygen via facemasks (or a Ventimask system). A majority of patients have been cured via this method.‚ÄúBut in a few patients, oxygenation using cannula (tube) is not enough to maintain optimum blood oxygenation levels. In such cases, an HFNC cannula has proven to be an extremely beneficial remedy,‚Äù Penurkar added.The HFNC is a piece of equipment that delivers warmed (37¬∞C) and humidified (100% relative humidity) oxygen at very high flow rates (nearly 60 litres per minute) through plugs that are fitted to patient's nostrils.Anesthetist Milind Belsare said: ‚ÄúUnlike standard oxygen therapy, which uses dry O2, the HFNC‚Äôs warmed and humidified oxygen maintains body temperature, reduces airway inflammation and maintains mucociliary function ‚Äî the cleaning mechanisms of the respiratory tract.‚Äù Sassoon hospital doctor said they were increasing HFNO beds from 12 to 50.But not every patient with respiratory distress will benefit from this system.

KOLHAPUR: A pilot serological survey, by a Goa-based clinical research firm, started in Kolhapur district on Saturday.

The survey will collect blood samples of 1 ,000 people from three locations in the district, including Kolhapur city. The blood samples will be tested for the presence and concentration of antibodies that are formed after Covid-19 infection take place. On Saturday, blood samples of seven persons from a village in Karveer tehsil were collected.

District collector Daulat Desai put forth the idea of the sero-surveillance that will help quantify the number of individuals in whom immunity has been developed to Covid infection. He has hired a Goa-based firm, Crom Clinical Research Private Limited, for the task. The firm is also involved in assisting in clinical trials on humans for developing vaccine at Panaji .

Dhanajay Lad, the director of the firm, said, ‚ÄúThe district administration is going to assist in the sero-survey. We will take both random and logical samples to test for the presence of antibodies. The survey is ICMR-approved. We will check for the percentage of people with immunity. This will help the authorities plan and utilise the resources wisely for the fight against Covid.‚Äù

From Monday, the samples will be taken from Kolhapur city. The authorities have decided to provide all necessary assistance to the firm to carry out the survey. Desai has asked the health officials to make one ambulance available to the firm to collect the samples and has assured financial assistance as the survey and tests are expensive. It takes around Rs 2,000 to collect and test each sample. Desai has allowed the firm to seek donations from the people to complete the survey.

Sero-surveys have already been carried out in big cities such as Delhi and Pune.

252,['23/08/2020'],‚ÄòThose who doubted Ram sing Ram dhun‚Äô,"Chief minister Yogi Adityanath addresses the Monsoon session at Vidhan Sabha, in Lucknow on Saturday

LUCKNOW: Taking a dig at the combined opposition, Chief minister Yogi Adityanath said on Saturday that those who were doubting the existence of Ram have now come to know about his power.

Speaking on the last day of monsoon session in the state assembly, he said that the beginning of the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya after 492 years of struggle has ushered in the era of Ram Rajya.

‚ÄúBut there are people who don‚Äôt like the concept of Ram Rajya. Therefore, they couldn‚Äôt hide their frustration and started playing divisive politics in the name of caste,‚Äù he said, in an apparent reference to the opposition parties.

Speaking after the passage of 27 bills amid the protest from the opposition, Yogi was in an unsparing mood, attacking the rival parties on issues like law and order, Covid battle and caste politics. He accused the SP, BSP and Congress of weakening his decisive battle against the coronavirus by their fake claims and projecting a false picture on the law and order situation in the state.

On law and order : The situation was far better than what it was during the Samajwadi Party government. The NCRB data also confirms that UP was at the bottom of the crime ladder and 20 other states were ahead of it in murder, rape, loot and dacoities. These are the people who ordered beheading of BJP worker when in power. There was a decline of 74.5% in dacoity, 26% in loot, 22% in murders, 22% in riots, 54% in kidnapping 38% in rape.

The CM compared the Opposition with the criminals surrendering to the police. ‚ÄúJust as criminals west UP are sporting placards stating they would not commit crime in future, the opposition would would soon go to the public promising they would not oppose the good deeds of the government,‚Äù he said.

On Ram Temple : Those who chant ‚ÄòRome‚Äô till the other day are saying ‚ÄòRam Ram‚Äô and those ‚Äúwho had ordered firing on the kar sewaks are also singing the Ram dhun ( tune)‚Äù. This is the transition the beginning of the construction of Ram temple has brought. Gradually the entire opposition will recite Ram. But it was unfortunate that the same forces did their best to stall the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya.

On bus row : One political party made mockery of the efforts by producing false registration numbers of scooters and bikes claiming the buses. Even the court scolded them for trivialising a serious work by the state government .

The chief minister claimed that the state was on the road to economic revival and the development works including the expressways and the state and national highways were being completed. He also thanked the speaker Hridaya Narain Dikshit for convening the assembly session amidst the corona crisis and conducting it successfully.

KOZHIKODE: The state government has asked the universities not to implement pension revision for college and university teachers on their own based on the pay revision order issued by the government in 2019.

The finance department in a circular said that the government has not issued corresponding pension revision order till date in the light of the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic .

‚ÄúHowever, several instances have come to the notice of the government that universities have been implementing pension revision on their own, based on the earlier (2019) pay revision order,‚Äù the circular issued by joint secretary (finance) stated.

It further stated that no pension revision order has been issued based on the pay revision order issued in 2019 and that the UGC pension should be calculated on the basis of pre-revised pay and it shall be disbursed based on pre-revised dearness relief on central rate.

Finance department officials said that varsities should wait for the pension revision order from the state government before implementing pension revision of teachers.

As part of austerity measures in the wake of Covid-19, the state government had issued the Kerala Disaster and Public Health Emergency (Special Provisions) ordinance to defer payment of salary and other allowance to government employees by up to 25% to fight the pandemic.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala government's intention in participating in the bid for Trivandrum International airport has come under a cloud following a revelation that it had engaged a firm which has close ties with Adani group as its legal consultant for the bid. Adani group was the major competitor for the government agency KSIDC and eventually won the bid by quoting 20% higher than that offered by KSIDC.

Records obtained under RTI Act reveal that the government had engaged law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, paying it Rs 55 lakh as fee for legal services rendered for participating in the airport bid. Paridhi, daughter of Cyril Shroff, the co-owner of the law firm, is the wife of Karan Adani, son of Gautam Adani. Karan Adani is personally looking after the Vizhinjam seaport project, being built by Adani group.

The Adani group had won the bid for the airport by quoting Rs 168 crore as against the state government's bid of Rs 135 crore. ""The firm was engaged after inviting expression of interest, and was selected by the transport department after a due process. It is one of the leading law firms in the country. The rate quoted by the state was decided upon by a committee consisting the chief secretary, finance secretary and transport secretary and the law firm had nothing to do with it or was aware of the rate quoted by the state,"" said a source.

Opposition member Ramesh Chennithala said if the news is true, it is nothing but an illegitimate deal between the government and Adani Group. That it was the same firm which has been giving legal advice to Adani group and the state government raises several questions and the government has to give an explanation, he said.

KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran said the government connived with Adani group for the airport‚Äôs takeover. BJP state president K Surendran said the government‚Äôs double-dealing has come to light. The government had spent Rs 2 crore for the bidding, when the Centre had decided to privatise operations of six airports, including Thiruvananthapuram.

As per an RTI reply received from the KSIDC, the main chunk of this expense was on engaging KPMG as the technical consultant for the bid. The other expenses include the fee for Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, bid processing fee for AAI, and commission for bank guarantee.

263,['23/08/2020'],3 UP teachers to get national award for drive &amp; innovation,"due recognition: Ishrat Ali, Snehil Pandey and Vikas Kumar

Lucknow: Three meritorious teachers from UP have been selected by the Centre for this year‚Äôs national awards. The teachers are being honoured for their efforts in improving enrolment, motivating students to attend school regularly and taking teaching-learning to higher levels by bringing in innovation to classrooms.

In all, 47 teachers from across the country will be honoured on the eve of Teacher‚Äôs Day celebrated on September 5. The three from UP are ‚Äî Mohammed Ishrat Ali, head teacher in a primary school, Rajwana in Mainpuri; Snehil Pandey, head teacher in a primary school Soharamau, Nawabganj in Unnao; and Vikas Kumar, principal, SD Inter College Meerapur, in Muzaffarnagar.

Snehil Pandey | Disturbed with lower rate of girls enrolling in schools, Snehil launched a unique scheme after taking over as school head in 2015 ‚Äî of gifting a bicycle to one girl, who travelled to school from the farthest place on foot, from her own salary. As a result, there are 136 girls as against 130 boys currently enrolled in her school. ‚ÄúThe initiative helped us in mobilising people. In many cases, we saw siblings too joining our school,‚Äù said Snehil, who dropped her studies in homeopathy to take up the cause of children.

Promoting joyful learning in her school, she helped increase enrolment, from 60 in 2014 to 266 this year, by community participation. The school boasts of its own website, a students‚Äô newspaper and a music band. Each student at her school has adopted a plant. These measures have generated positive vibes among children. In addition, there is a library for parents. During the Covid-induced lockdown, Snehil took help from alumni to connect with students for online classes.

Ishrat Ali | Six years ago when Ali took over as the school head, there were 78 students enrolled in the school. And of this, only 45% attended school on an average. Through innovative experimentation and social participation, the number today stands at 216, and the attendance on any given day is above 85%. ‚ÄúUsing my own money, I started a stationery corner where students got stationery for free,‚Äù said Ali. In 2015, Ali‚Äôs school bagged the best school title in the state. Using the prize money, the school bought furniture for the students. Projectors were purchased to set up smart classes. ‚ÄúWhen I was promoted as head teacher to another school in 2014, my students staged a stir-in before the DM. I was honoured by the love and affection of little children. Subsequently, I was promoted to the same school,‚Äù Ali said.

Vikas Kumar | To make teaching-learning attractive, Vikas used videos on various topics and included characters like ‚ÄòMotu-Patlu‚Äô which made topics interesting for students. In 2010, when Kumar took over as a school head, there were 767 students (from class IX to XII).

Today, the student strength in his school is 2,350. ‚ÄúWe engaged students in making innovative models in Atal innovation lab. Our focus is to develop, in students, a scientific temper,‚Äù said Kumar. In his school, he has initiated a unique bank where students deposit 10 unused pens and in return, they are given one new pen, free of cost. He motivates students to take up social work and to build community assets.

265,['23/08/2020'],Restaurants cook up creative ideas to stay ahead of game,"Restaurants have been using presentation props such as earthen pots and banana leaves to serve food

PUNE: Restaurants allowed take away and delivery services are going beyond the mundane to offer customers a unique experience.

From serving meals in earthen pots to laying out authentic South Indian-style preparations on banana leaves , they are trying out different ways to make food not just fun to have, but also appetising too.

‚ÄúI recently ordered food from The Royal Champaran House, which delivers food in earthen pots in which it is cooked. The pots are sealed when delivered and when you open them, you get a rich smokey flavour. We also received a personalised thank you note from the restaurant,‚Äù said Rashmi Dongre-Patil, a resident of Undri.

The restaurant is popular for its non-vegetarian delicacy, matka gosht, which is cooked in dum style in earthen pots on low heat. It also offers East Indian delicacies, such as sattu paratha and luchi.

Shibin TN, a caterer, said, ‚ÄúWe offer a range of authentic preparations from Kerala , which is different from the regular dosa and idli served at South Indian restaurants. We offer sadhya, which includes 20-25 items, depending on the category of your choice. The food is served in a particular way on banana leaves. We also give banana leaves along with the orders.‚Äù

Jayesh Paranjpe, who recently started a delivery kitchen for authentic Maharashtrian food, said, ‚ÄúPeople know that South Indian food is served on banana leaves, but very few know that this is a tradition for Maharashtrian food as well. We specialise in authentic Maharashtrian home food, and we also provide thalis, which include preparations for special occasions such as weddings. With each mejwani thali , we also give one banana leaf. Since people might not know how to serve the meal on the leaf, we also provide a card with instructions on how to lay out the food.‚Äù

Food consultant Karen Anand, said, ‚ÄúThese types of meals make for a great experience because of the portions served in thalis and the significance of each preparation.‚Äù

Stressing the need for presentation props, she said, ‚ÄúWe all have to be creative and use this time to strategise effectively. It‚Äôs not easy to ask restaurants to think out of the ‚Äòfood box‚Äô. But those who do come up with novel ideas and tie-ups will be ahead of the game.‚Äù

AMBALA: Ambala Police on Saturday booked six persons on charges of sedition and attempt to wage war against India over a suspicious threat letter received at the Indian Air Force ( IAF ) station, said Ambala superintendent of police (SP) Abhishek Jorwal.

‚ÄúA suspicious hand-written letter was received in the post at IAF station in Ambala Cantonment on Friday. The letter mentioned some blasts at different places of the country,‚Äù SP Jorwal said. When asked if the letter mentioned any plan to blow up the IAF station in Ambala, the SP said, ‚ÄúIt is completely incorrect and there is no threatening mention of blowing up the IAF station. The fact is that it has been received at the IAF station, otherwise, it doesn‚Äôt seems suspicious.‚Äù

About the content of the letter, SP Jorwal said, ‚ÄúA lady claiming to be a detective wrote that she possesses information about some blasts about to happen in Delhi, Ayodhya, Ambala and parts of Punjab between August 15 and August

29. She has given five to six mobile numbers of the persons allegedly involved to commit the blasts. Of the details mentioned, we have verified a man of Jalandhar, who is a cook and a man of Bilaspur, Yamunanagar, who has a furniture business in the town. The wife of the man from Jalandhar belongs to Ambala.

The Bilaspur man had an affair with a woman in Ambala and a compromise was reached between them following a dispute. In such a suspicious manner, it appears that somebody has posted this letter with a motive to harass somebody whose numbers are given. Two persons have been verified. They are normal citizens and the rest are being verified.‚Äù

A case has been registered.

Lucknow: Responding to Opposition‚Äôs demand of sharing details of expenditure on tackling the Covid-19 pandemic, finance minister Suresh Khanna said the government has spent approximately Rs 22,000 crore under various heads from the Rs 24,000 crore collected towards Covid-19 management till now.

Khanna shared the data in the Vidhan Parishad on Saturday after Opposition demanded where Covid fund had been spent.

Samajwadi Party members accused the government of corruption, saying it claims to have created an enviable health infrastructure, but patients are struggling to get admission in hospital.

‚ÄúThe government has been deducting 30% from the salaries of MLCs and MLAs for the last five months. We want the government to tell us where this money has been spent,‚Äù said Samajwadi Party MLC Anand Bhadauria. MLC Sunil Sajan asked where were 1.25 lakh Covid beds Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath claims to have readied. Sajan had on Friday shared details of his stay in Sanjay Gandhi PostGraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) when he was down with Covid-19.

‚ÄúCurrently there are about 48,000 active cases in Uttar Pradesh. Some of them are in home quarantine. So, the number of patients in hospitals is much below 1.25 lakh. Why are people still dying in ambulances, waiting to get admission to hospitals? The government has looted funds it collected in the name of Covid-19,‚Äù he alleged.

Rebutting the allegations, Khanna referred to Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, who he said had welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for giving up part of his salary for Covid-19 fight.

‚ÄúMulayam Singh ji will be so disappointed to know his party members are fighting for their salary when the world is battling this virus. The government has been providing ration and cash to over 20 lakh people regularly since lockdown. We have spent around Rs 22,000 crore under various heads till now,‚Äù Khanna said.

KARNAL: Nearly one-and-a-half months after a woman employee of a noted private school in Karnal accused the owner, principal and a government official of gang rape , the district police have arrested her and her husband for allegedly taking Rs 7.25 lakh from the accused to settle the case, said the police.

Rajiv Kumar, deputy superintendent of police (DSP), said the owner of the private school gave a complaint to the police that the woman was demanding Rs 15 lakh from them to settle an alleged gang rape case.

He said Karnal superintendent of police (SP) Surender Singh Bhoria formed a team led by tehsildar Indri as a duty magistrate and Sanjeev Kumar, in-charge, civil line police station, and arrested the alleged rape survivor and her husband from Sector 12 near Nirmal Kutiya Chowk while they were accepting Rs 7.25 lakh on August 21.

The DSP said, the complainant had also alleged that Rs 6 lakh had already been given to the woman.

DSP Rajiv said two FIRs have already been registered in this case, as the police had received counter complaints from both sides. This is the third FIR linked with that case. A special investigation team (SIT) is probing the matter.

He further said a case had been registered against her under sections 384, 389, and 506 of the IPC and her husband under section 120B. On Saturday, they were produced before the court and sent to 14 days judicial custody.

It is pertinent to mention that the woman filed a complaint at the women‚Äôs police station on July 6, following which a case was registered against the accused under sections of gang rape of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

In her complaint, the woman had alleged that she was raped in 2018 by the owner of the private school and a government official. She also accused the school principal of being party to the crime. She said they had been harassing her mentally and physically since then.

However, police claimed that the owner of the school had also filed a complaint of extortion against the teacher.

Vinay Bansal, the advocate of the woman, refuted the allegation and said the police were trying to implicate her in a false case. ‚ÄúThe allegations are baseless and we will prove it in the court,‚Äù Bansal added. He claimed that the police had sought two-day police remand, but the court did not agree and sent her to judicial custody.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

272,['23/08/2020'],Row over ineligible vs eligible ACFs for DFO promotion,"Nagpur: A tug-of-war for promotion from assistant conservator of forests (ACFs) to divisional forest officers (DFOs) has ensued in the Maharashtra forest department between eligible and ineligible candidates.

While the PCCF‚Äôs office is considering the ‚Äòineligible‚Äô lot, over 28 eligible ACFs clamouring for promotions took the battle to the principal secretary (forest) Milind Mhaiskar‚Äôs court demanding justice.

‚ÄúFor direct ACFs, the criteria for promotion is 3 years of probation and 3 years of regular service. But ACFs who are in service for a long time become eligible the day they are promoted. The department promotion committee (DPC) meeting is slated for Monday and the seniority list prepared is as per the rules,‚Äù said APCCF (personnel) Maheep Gupta.

However, direct ACFs said, ‚ÄúWe comply with all norms for promotion but candidates who got ad hoc promotion from the post of RFO to ACF and whose promotion is not even regularized by MPSC till date and moreover are junior to us are being considered.‚Äù

Promotion rules are being questioned by the aggrieved lot. ‚ÄúPromotion rules are misinterpreted. As per the ACF Recruitment Rules, 1965 ‚Äî on successful completion of 2 years‚Äô training ‚Äî direct recruited ACFs were posted on probation and their training period was not considered as service period.‚Äù they said.

They added that ACF Recruitment Rules, 1965, were superseded in 1998 after which 2 years‚Äô probation period of directly recruited ACFs and one-year field training is considered as service period. On a petition filed by some aggrieved ACFs, on September 16, 2016, the MAT upheld this view and later the state also agreed to consider training period as service period and allowed all the related benefits by issuing a GR on August 14, 2018. Based on this GR, the final seniority list was released on March 7, 2019.

This seniority list was challenged in the high court, Aurangabad bench, in which state‚Äôs general administrative department (GAD) advised to rectify DFO Promotion Rules-1984. ‚ÄúHowever, the opinion of GAD was deliberately not put before the HC and a civil application was filed by the department requesting the court to elevate promotee ACFs and exclude us as our batch had not completed 3 years of regular service after passing departmental exam. On this department stand, the court lifted the stay on the promotion process on August 23, 2019,‚Äù the ACFs said.

Accordingly, the department elevated promotee ACFs as DFOs though they were junior as per the seniority list. Those promoted as DFOs were not regularized by the government on the post of ACFs. Department also promoted 18 newly recruited ACFs as DFOs without rectifying rules.

‚ÄúOne woman officer from Chandrapur was termed as ineligible by the departmental promotion committee (DPC) but was still given promotion. However, the department has taken a different stand against the batch of 28 ACFs,‚Äù they said.

The seniority list of ACF cadre has not been regularized since 2000. However, the department went on including these promotee ACFs in the seniority list and has given promotions to the post of DFO and even awarded IFS to them.

LUCKNOW: Despite enjoying a majority in the Upper House, Samajwadi Party and other Opposition parties were unable to prevent the passing of some bills in Vidhan Parishad on Saturday.

In fact, the proceedings started late by 3.5 hours as SP members sat on a protest in the chairperson‚Äôs office over the passing of a bill on Friday without the party‚Äôs amendment being considered.

Incidentally, the last bill to be passed on Saturday also sailed through in similar fashion with SP trying to move an amendment in vain.

‚ÄúOn Friday, a bill on reservation for EWS was passed. SP has no objection to the bill, but wanted to know how the government had identified EWS for it. Before the proceedings commenced on Saturday, the chairperson accepted that there had been an error on Friday because our amendment was not taken up, and that something like this would not be repeated. He asked us to let the proceedings commence on the condition that he would allow voting if we wanted. However, the promise was entirely forgotten once we went inside,‚Äù said MLC Sunil Sajan. As MLC Shashank Yadav asked chairperson Ramesh Yadav to explain why the amendment proposal had been termed ‚Äòinadmissible‚Äô without giving any reason, his colleague Udayveer Singh said it was the basic right of members to propose amendments and running the house in this way is dangerous for democracy.

However, a similar story unfolded later when SP tried to move an amendment proposal for the ‚ÄòUttar Pradesh Recovery of Damage to Public and Private Property Bill, 2020‚Äô, but a voice vote was taken and the bill passed amid massive protests by SP members. ‚ÄúThis bill is against the high court order and is legally incorrect. However, our objections have not even been registered,‚Äù said Yadav.

BJP attacked the Opposition for questioning the chairperson‚Äôs decision, which it said was final and above politics.

Responding to SP charges, labour minister Swami Prasad Maurya said BJP had in fact fulfilled a demand made by both SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav and BSP chief Mayawati by giving 10% reservation to people of economically weaker sections, he said once the chairperson gives an order, it should not be challenged.

Appreciating farmers for the sustained efforts they made despite the Covid-19 pandemic, he emphasised the role of crop diversification, use of seeds of improved varieties and advanced technology developed by the university.

Today, farmers need to increase fertility of the land with the adoption of organic farming, crop residue management, integrated pest and fertiliser management, water conservation and reducing expenditure incurred on farming by using natural resources. Through these means, farmers can become employers instead of seeking employment, he said. He also spoke about the urgent need for involvement of maximum number of agricultural entrepreneurs and progressive farmers in such programmes.

A total of 1,517 farmers and agricultural scientists registered themselves in the webinar.

278,['23/08/2020'],Gujarat: 25% of radio-collared Asiatic lions have died in one year,"File photo: King being choked?

AHMEDABAD: In the last one year , one out of four radio-collared Asiatic lions have died in their last abode in Gujarat. This has raised concerns among wildlife experts and lion lovers as radio collaring is done on young lions whose mortality rate in the overall population is usually very low. Some of them even claim that the unscientific use of collars could have led to the deaths of the majestic beasts.

Dushyant Vasavada, chief conservator of forests, Junagadh Wildlife Circle, recently sent a letter to the deputy forest officials, urging them to take necessary action wherever they received any complaints regarding radio collaring of lions in their area.

The state forest department has got 75 tracking collars. So far, 89 lions have been tagged to keep a track on their movement. This suggests that at least 14 lions who were radio collared may have died prompting the authorities to use their collars in other animals. Messages and pictures raising concern over radio collaring of lions have been circulated in social media.

‚ÄúA total of 19 radio-collared lions have died. There are many reasons behind their deaths but some people are claiming that the deaths are due to radio collaring which is baseless. We have tagged 89 lions so far,‚Äù said Vasavada. When asked about the mail sent to DFOs recently, he said it was only a precautionary measure.

Wildlife experts working in Gir forest say that the number of deaths of radio collared lions could be higher.

H S Singh, a member of India‚Äôs National Board for Wildlife and an expert on Gir lions said tagging of such large number of lions was unnecessary. ‚ÄúThe mortality rate in young and sub-adult lions is very low so it is very unfortunate that so many lions who were radio collared have died,‚Äù said Singh.

A K Sharma, a retired IFS officer who was awarded with government of India‚Äôs Kirti Chakra for rescuing lions from poachers in 1989, said lions should not be treated like guinea pigs for the purpose of experimentation.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see any justification for collaring so many lions. These collars should be immediately removed. They can cause pressure on their neck and impedes their hunting capabilities. It appears that the radio collaring is done to make the lives of forest officials easy in tracking the majestic beast rather than for any research purpose,‚Äù said Sharma.

Radio collaring is usually done for research purpose and should be limited to a dozen Asiatic lions for it can lead to serious behavioural changes in the animal, according to Singh.

The radio collars were purchased by the state forest department at Rs 6.5 lakh per piece after the Canine Distemper Virus took toll on about 29 lions in October 2018. The purpose of tagging as cited by the department then was for tracking and disease surveillance.

Apart from the discomfort that can be caused by the 1.5 kg of collar, two wildlife experts said collaring young lions, especially males, seems to be proving fatal.

‚ÄúThe reason being that their manes grow quite quickly and the head size increases for a few years. Many forest officials in Gir have realized this and have begun removing the collars if they find the big cats facing any discomfort,‚Äù they said. The state forest department did not consult experts before radio collaring such a large population, said sources.

A researcher with the Wildlife Institute of India said that radio collaring should be done only on one lioness from each pride and that the total number of radio collared lions should not be more than 10. This was, however, not the case here as many lions and lionesses from the same pride have been chosen in many instances.

As per the recent lion census, the population in Gir and surrounding areas is 674 of which 417 is the adult population. ‚ÄúOut of 417 adult lions, 300 must be young adults. This means we have radio collared about 25% of young adult animals from this last surviving Asiatic lion population. Such unusual high number of animals have not been radio collared anywhere else in the world,‚Äù said an expert.

The average number of lion deaths per year is roughly 100 per year in last five years, he said. ‚ÄúSo overall mortality is 16% per year. Out of these 16%, majority are cubs or old age animals. This means that mortality rate of collared young healthy lions is four times higher than that of non-collared young adult lions,‚Äù the official said.

Joglekar dragged the builder to RERA after Raiyani failed to hand over possession of the flat to him in December 2017 as promised.It took more than two years of legal battle for Joglekar to get the builder‚Äôs property, a 1,350-sq foot flat, under the hammer. The flat was attached by Vadodara revenue authorities in October 2019, after Raiyani failed to refund Joglekar‚Äôs money on RERA‚Äôs order.Raiyani made an agreement with Joglekar in 2016 that by December 2017, he would give possession of a flat in his Dove Deck project on Ajwa Road for payment of Rs 28 lakh. Joglekar obtained a bank loan for the purpose and paid Rs 20 lakh to the builder. When he did not get the flat, he complained to RERA in Gandhinagar. In October 2018, RERA ordered Raiyani to return the money to the customer for his failure to give possession of the flat.When the builder did not refund the money, RERA issued a recovery warrant against Raiyani. The district collector accordingly passed an order. The flat was attached in October 2019. ‚ÄúThe process was very slow.

NAGPUR: With over 5,800 Covid-19 positive patients in home isolation in the district, some have lodged complaints with the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) alleging they are facing social stigma . With the help of NMC and the police , NGO ‚ÄòTogether We Can‚Äô is resolving issues and also providing essentials.

‚ÄúOne member of a family residing in a flat scheme in Itwari is in home isolation. A few flat owners locked the door of that flat from outside. The family contacted the NMC control room. The family had to say that their relative resides in the same flat scheme and since they were helping by supplying milk, groceries and vegetables, a few of the other flat owners are raising objections. Police reached the flat scheme and resolved the issue,‚Äù a volunteer from the NGO told TOI.

Talking about a somewhat similar issue, president of NGO Joseph George , said, ‚ÄúSome flat owners of a scheme in Giripeth were not allowing home delivery of essentials to a family in home isolation and quarantine. Even their garbage was not being lifted. We informed Sitabuldi police who reached the place and warned of action and the problem got resolved.‚Äù

Not only co-residents, even a cop, too, victimized a family in home isolation. ‚ÄúA policeman kept a family with a three-year-old child without milk and vegetables for two days in Chitnavis Nagar off Umred Road. The policeman and a few others told the milkman and vegetable vendor to discontinue supply to the family. The policeman also abused their relative who was supplying medicines and other essentials. The family contacted the NMC control room. I also took the corporator from the ward to the policeman. We provided a grocery kit to the family which is sufficient for around 20 days. Still, the family was in trouble. Then we requested additional CP Nilesh Bharne who resolved the issue,‚Äù said Nilesh Dhamdhwani, another volunteer from the NGO.

In another case, some locals resorted to pelting stones at the NMC‚Äôs barricade. ‚ÄúThe control room received a call from a family in home isolation saying their neighbours were pelting stones at the barricade installed by the NMC for the containment zone. The family was told to say that some people from the area threatened them not to be in home isolation. We informed the police who swiftly visited the area and sorted out the issue,‚Äù said Anusuya Kale-Chhabrani .

API Amol Dond, posted in the NMC control room, said, ‚ÄúSome flat owners of a scheme contacted the NMC control room and demanded that their security guard be taken to any other place. The call was transferred to me. I guided them and told them not to harass the security guard and instead, help him,‚Äù he said.

Cracking the whip, municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe reiterated NMC‚Äôs stand regarding such issues. ‚ÄúStringent action, including FIR, will be registered against people who engage in social stigma against positive persons in home isolation. No one has the right to ostracize anyone. The need of the hour is to maintain a safe distance from positive patients and not social distance. We have to socially and emotionally support positive patients,‚Äù said Mundhe.

Doing such challenging work has not been easy for the NGO. ‚ÄúWe contact positive patients daily and enquire about their health. A couple of patients in home isolation said they went out to purchase vegetables and groceries as they are alone and have no support from anyone to get home delivery. Milkmen, vegetable vendors and home delivery of groceries etc get interrupted once neighbours learn that the family is infected. Some measures need to be chalked out for such people,‚Äù the NGO said.

When the district administration and NMC started quarantine centres to accommodate high-risk contacts of positive persons, people lodged complaints demanding shifting of the centres. Even the administration had closed down a couple of quarantine centres following a demand from a legislator and one of the top officials.

With the rise in number of active patients, the NMC had allowed home isolation of positive patients and home quarantine of high-risk contacts from July 27. As on Saturday, 1,993 patients in home isolation were declared recovered. Around 5,861 positive patients are in home isolation.

The other new vice-presidents are SP turncoat and Rajya Sabha member Surendra Nagar, Satpal Saini, Neelam Sonkar, former Mahila Morcha chief Kamlawati Singh, Prakash Pal, Devendra Chaudhary, Braj Bahadur and Sunita Dayal.

Only two vice-presidents ‚Äî Rajya Sabha member Kanta Kardam and prominent ST leader Laxman Acharya ‚Äî have been retained.

For the posts of general secretary, the party has banked on tried and tested faces. While vice-president JPS Rathore has been moved to the post of general secretary, Ashwini Tyagi, who was taking care of west UP as secretary, will also take over as general secretary.

The party has also rewarded Kannauj MP Subrata Pathak ‚Äî who defeated Dimple Yadav, wife of SP president Akhilesh Yadav, in the Lok Sabha elections ‚Äî with the post of general secretary. Earlier, he was a secretary in the organisation.

The party has tried to pacify former MP Priyanka Rawat, who was denied a ticket from Barabanki in 2019 Lok Sabha elections, by making her party general secretary. Anup Gupta and Amarpal Maurya, who were secretaries and part of the BJP‚Äôs election team, have been appointed as general secretaries.

Prominent leaders who have been shunted out as state general secretaries include Ashok Kataria, who was made transport minister last year, and former MLC Vidya Sagar Sonkar. Govid Narayan Shukla is the only face who has been retained as state general secretary.

Of the 16 party secretaries, only three ‚Äî Devesh Kori, Anjula Mahaur and Sanjay Rai ‚Äî have been retained. Of the remaining, three have been promoted while others have been shunted out. New entrants on the post of secretary are president of UP unit of Bharatiya Janta Yuva Morcha, Subhash Yaduvansh, and party spokesperson Chandra Mohan Singh.

284,['23/08/2020'],"Closure of shops: Power bill, GST number to help odd-even take off","Ludhiana: As the authorities are all set to implement the odd-even rule for shops dealing in non-essential items in Ludhiana from Monday onwards, they have made it clear that in case shops have no serial numbers, then the selection can be made on the basis of electricity bills, GST number or they can even assign a temporary number to shops to execute the order.

The order issued by the district magistrate-cum-deputy commissioner on Friday said, ‚ÄúNot more than 50% of shops dealing in non-essential commodities shall remain open on a given day within the jurisdiction of Ludhiana municipal corporation. Non-essential shops having even serial number will open on even dates and shops with odd serial number will open on odd dates.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Ludhiana police commissioner and MC commissioner will implement this odd-even formula. But all shops dealing in essential commodities shall remain open on all days as per the timings given in the order. And there will be no odd-even outside MC‚Äôs jurisdiction,‚Äù the order read.

Asked about whether it will be difficult to implement the order as every shop doesn‚Äôt have serial numbers, deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma said some things are in letter and spirit, but spirit is more important than the letter. He said he has left it to the local SDMs and SHOs to decide on how to implement the order.

‚ÄúIf there is some problem anywhere, they can take help of the electricity bill numbers of shopkeepers or GST numbers. Even temporary numbers can also be allotted to these shops,‚Äù the DC said. He said the SDMs, SHOs can sit with associations to come up with a system to implement the formula or even associations could do it on their own.

The shopkeepers are meanwhile skeptical about the implementation of the order.

‚ÄúThe order is better than complete shutdown as the business community has to earn its livelihood as well. Already we have faced the brunt of long lockdown. If they are coming up with such an order wherein shops dealing with non-essential articles will open on alternate days, they should at least exempt the power bills of these shops as they have to pay full month rent for the shops,‚Äù said Gurpreet Singh, a stationary store owner near Jawahar camp market area.

‚ÄúHowever, we doubt whether they will be able to implement the order as not every market has shops with numbers. Even if they devise a system to implement it, customers will be confused on whether a particular shop will be open on a particular day or not,‚Äù he added.

In a message, Ludhiana police commissioner on Saturday evening said, ""Only 50% Non Essential shops will open in any particular area. Even number shops can open on even dates and odd number shops can open on odd dates on weekdays. The places where shops do not have number, they can paint temporary numbers with the help of market associations.‚Äù

KOCHI: When Attappadi plunged into darkness for a week due to a power outage early this month, Sanoop C was busy visiting houses in his tribal colony and neighbouring colonies to collect details of students who have completed Class X and XII.

Sanoop is one of the tribal youth volunteers linked to the Adishakti Summer School, which is looking to creating awareness among students from marginalized communities about the scope of higher education , and helping them apply for courses.

With higher secondary and degree admission procedures going fully online due to the pandemic, Adishakti has stepped in to help students without access to the internet to apply for desired courses. It has created WhatsApp groups to collect details of students from various districts. Group members also submit applications for the students.

An initiative of Adivasi Gotra Mahasabha founder M Geetanandan, Adishakti Summer School was established in 2014 to stem the dropout rate among dalit and adivasi students in the state.

‚ÄúMost of the students in my area do not have internet connectivity to apply for degree courses. I collected their details and sent them to WhatsApp groups formed by Adishakti Summer School ,‚Äù said Sanoop, who belongs to the Kurumba community and hails from Gotyarkandi ooru in Attappadi. A third-year degree student, he aspires to join the police and is preparing for his SI test.

Vanitha V, a volunteer from Marayur in Idukki, struggles to convince members of her community about the scope of education. A member of Hill Pulaya tribe, Vanitha helped four students from her community apply for Plus One.

‚ÄúMost of the children in our community drop out of school early. Though some of the families reside in town, there are around eight ‚Äòkudis‚Äô in the interior forest. They are reluctant to come out,‚Äù said Vanitha, who herself braved the odds to emerge from a kudi to pursue higher education. Vanitha is currently preparing for the civil service examination in Thiruvananthapuram.

The group has so far helped around 100 students apply for higher studies. Adishakti conducts camps for students every year. These camps help identify skilled students and give them assistance in pursuing their areas of interest. Most youth who are part of this year‚Äôs admission initiative were participants of camps conducted in previous years.

289,['23/08/2020'],Alternate Haridwar route remains 'unused' despite heavy spending,"HARIDWAR: Hill bypass road , falling in the Haridwar range of Rajaji Tiger Reserve (RTR) and developed as an alternate route to clear traffic during bathing festivals and mega fairs like Kumbh and Ardh Kumbh, has remained largely unused.

According to sources, the government has spent around Rs 34 crore since 2010 for maintaining this route. But, the road is hardly used during peak season as getting permission is not easy. The route is in the RTR area.

Despite this, the government has prepared a fresh Rs 29 crore proposal for long-term treatment of the route citing Kumbh Mela 2021. The route is often damaged due to landslides in the monsoon season. At present, around 6-km hill bypass road has remained blocked due to landslides at several points.

According to the public works department of Haridwar, Rs 3.46 crore was spent in 2010 while around Rs 30 crore had been spent in 2016 in which a bridge was built on the route. The department spent over Rs 20 lakh in 2018 for its maintenance.

Deepak Kumar, executive engineer of PWD, Haridwar, told TOI, ‚ÄúMajor construction works were done in 2010 and 2016 from Kumbh and Ardh Kumbh budget respectively. Similarly, other maintenance works have been done from time to time. Currently, the route is blocked due to landslide.""

Kumar added, ""In the wake of Kumbh mela 2021, we have submitted a fresh Rs 29 crore proposal for long term treatment plan of the route and Rs 3.50 crore short term treatment plan. Works will be done as per the budget availability.‚Äù

Locals, however, raised questions on spending money on this unused route. Social activist Dr Vishal Garg told TOI, ‚ÄúHill bypass route has been hardly used in the past 10 years while authorities have spent a lot of money which is a waste of public funds.‚Äù

290,['23/08/2020'],Law firm linked to Adani Jr advised govt on airport bid,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: State government‚Äôs intentions in participating in the bid for Thiruvananthapuram airport has come under a cloud after it has been revealed that it had engaged a firm which has close ties with Adani group as its legal consultant for the bid.

Adani group was the major competitor for the government agency KSIDC and eventually it won the bid by quoting 20% higher amount than offered by KSIDC.

As per records obtained under RTI Act, the government had engaged the law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas paying Rs 55.4 lakh as fee for legal services rendered for participating in the airport bid.

Paridhi, daughter of Cyril Shroff , the co-owner of the law firm, is the wife of Karan Adani, the son of Gautam Adani . Karan Adani is personally looking after the Vizhinjam seaport project, being built by Adani group.

The Adani group had won the bid for the airport by quoting Rs 168 as against the state government‚Äôs bid of Rs 135. The government engaging a firm that has close professional and personal ties with Adani group raises questions of conflict of interest.

But government sources rubbished the matter, and said the law firm was selected purely on professional merit. ""The firm was engaged after inviting expression of interest, and was selected by transport department after a due process. It is one of the leading law firms of the country... The rate was quoted by a committee consisting of the chief secretary, finance secretary and transport secretary and the law firm had nothing to do with quoting the rate or was not aware of the rate quoted by the state,"" said a government source.

Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said if the news is true, it is nothing but an illegitimate deal between the government and Adani Group. That it was the same firm which has been giving legal advice to Adani group and the state government raises several questions and the government has to give an explanation to the public, he said.

KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran said the government connived with Adani group for the airport‚Äôs takeover. BJP state president K Surendran said the government‚Äôs double-dealing has come to light with the new revelations.

The government had spent Rs 2.36 crore for bidding for Thiruvananthapuram airport, when the Centre had decided to privatize operations of six airports across the country, including Thiruvananthapuram.

As per an RTI reply received from the KSIDC, the main chunk of this expense was on engaging KPMG as the technical consultant for the bid. The government paid Rs 1.57 crore as consultant fee. The other expenses include the fee for Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, bid processing fee for Airport Authority of India, and commission for bank guarantee.

A reputed private hospital is also expected to add 20 more level-3 beds soon.

Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma said they already have 16 level-3 beds in the civil hospital and will add 15 more such beds for such patients. He said they will get this system operationalized in a week‚Äôs time.

The DC said they have staff for these facilities at the civil hospital and the government has asked them to recruit staff for such facilities locally. He said they have a waiting list of such candidates and will recruit more as per the requirement.

‚ÄúBeds are not a big issue and not many people are dying because of lack of beds,‚Äù Sharma said. He said they have been assured by Satguru Udhay Singh that they will add 20 more level-3 beds in the coming time. Besides, CMCH has also added more such beds.

Meanwhile, residents who have suffered because of alleged shortage of beds said the authorities should get more level-3 beds operationalised at the civil hospital without further delay.

‚ÄúNormally the patients who cannot afford costly treatment at private hospitals go to the civil hospital for such facilities and due to absence of level-3 facilities they have to be shifted to Rajindra Hospital Patiala. As the golden period to save them is lost in shifting such patients so chances of their survival get bleak.

MUSSOORIE: Two Raj-era iconic post offices in Mussoorie , one of them almost as old as the hill town itself, face closure following a proposal by the department of posts. Local residents have said that the post offices, which are relics of the past and part of the town‚Äôs identity, must be preserved.

The sub-post office situated in Landour , one that gave Mussoorie its first address, is believed to have been set up in 1837. According to writer and local historian Ganesh Saili, the establishment of this post office was facilitated by Captain Frederick Young, regarded as the founder of Mussoorie.

Famous writer Ruskin Bond , who lives in Landour, said he was sad at the development.

‚ÄúIt is sad that the authorities are mulling closure of the post office in Landour. I have been using this post office since 1964, when I permanently moved to Mussoorie,‚Äù Bond reminisces.

Recalling his pleasant association with the postmen here, who were quite regular in bringing his mails, Bond said, ‚ÄúI have even written about one or two postmen in my stories.‚Äù

Talking about the origin of the iconic post office , Saili who has written many books on the history of the hill town, said, ‚ÄúThis post office was set up to serve the invalids of the convalescent depot for the British soldiers in Landour.‚Äù

In fact, Landour post office served as the head post office for more than 50 years before the head post office was set up on the Mall Road in 1909.

There is another interesting bit of history related to Landour post office.

According to Saili, the father of renowned hunter and conservationist Jim Corbett , Christopher William Corbett, worked as a postmaster here from 1850 to 1863.

The other sub-post office facing closure is situated in the premises of Hotel Savoy near Gandhi Chowk in Mussoorie and was established in 1902. The plush hotel with its Edwardian interiors ‚Äì built by Cecil D Lincoln, an Irish barrister from Lucknow ‚Äì was completed in that year itself. The rent for the sub-post office is just Rs 99 since it was fixed before Independence and has not been hiked since.

Apart from its picturesque location, the post office has a unique seal.

‚ÄúUsually, the seals at post offices bear the name of the place and name of the head post office, but the century-old seal here just says ‚ÄòSavoy Hotel‚Äô and it is still being used,‚Äù said Gaurav Joshi, postmaster at the Mussoorie‚Äôs head post office.

Joshi, however, said that there has not been any decision yet on the proposal.

‚ÄúWe hope the department junks this proposal and saves the town‚Äôs landmarks,‚Äù said Saili.

LUCKNOW: It was a tip-off by Military Intelligence (MI) sleuths, who were on a recce of an obscure godown in Meerut as part of anti-terror vigil before Independence Day, that busted the Rs 50-crore racket of printing of NCERT books.

MI personnel got a whiff of the scam during a discreet surveillance of the facility after receiving inputs of suspicious activity at Kashigaon, Achronda Road under Partapur police station of Meerut. They shared intelligence inputs with Special Task Force (STF) of UP , who too joined the investigation.

Late on Friday, STF along with local police raided the facility, but the kingpin Sachin Gupta wriggled out of the dragnet and even burned down a similar stock of books at his main factory in Mohkampur Enclave, Sabzimandi. ‚ÄúDuring the raid, at least 1.5 lakh books were seized from a godown in Kashigaon, but the owner managed to flee,‚Äù said an STF officer.

Four persons in the factory premises ‚Äî Shivam, Rahul, Akash, Sunil Kumar ‚Äî were arrested for failing to provide proof of printing NCERT books with government approval and later questioned for leads.

‚ÄúThey disclosed that owners, Sanjeev and Sachin Gupta, ran the racket and had employed two youths, Vikas Tyagi and Nafees to route the stock to Meerut after printing at Delhi‚Äôs TNHK printers and publication,‚Äù said deputy superintendent of police, STF, Brijesh Singh. The seized books are being systematically counted, the officer said. ‚ÄúIt also came up during investigation that these books were being supplied to buyers in multiple states, including UP, Uttarakhand and Delhi and transported in vehicles with BJP flags stuck in the bonnet to avert suspicion,‚Äù said Singh.

The owner of the facility, Sachin Gupta, 30, reached the main factory in Mohkampur Enclave and burnt down a huge stock. Six printing machines were seized from the factory, the STF said.

An FIR was registered against the kingpin‚Äôs aides, Shivam, Rahul, Akash, Sunil Kumar, Sanjeev Gupta, Sachin Gupta, Vikas Tyagi and Nafees.

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate's money laundering case against Agrasain Gehlot , elder brother of Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, seems to have hit a roadblock with senior Gehlot moving the Rajasthan HC against ED's summonses. The anti-money laundering agency has so far issued three summonses to Agrasain, asking him to appear before its investigating officers at its Delhi headquarters.

The ED has also been looking for another prime accused in the fertiliser scam case, Pravin Saraf of Saraf Impex who, like Gehlot, has not honoured any of the agency's summonses issued to him. According to agency officers, Saraf is absconding though he has written to the agency seeking postponement of his questioning. The ED, which was contemplating other actions that may include arrest of the accused, is finding it difficult to proceed in the case in view of the court cases.

Gehlot's case has been listed for Monday before the Jodhpur bench of the Rajasthan HC where the ED has been served a notice to defend its case, according to sources. According to a preliminary probe, Anupam Krishi, the firm owned by Gehlot, was engaged in alleged illegal export of potash in league with Saraf Impex Pvt Ltd. Anupam Krishi was the origin of the exports made by Saraf Impex. The total illegal exports of MOP (Muriate of Potash) is around 30,000 tons worth Rs 130 crore. Agrasain is accused of receiving huge commission.

297,['23/08/2020'],Warning against use of masks with valves,"RANCHI: Weeks after the Union health ministry issued a warning against the use of N-95 masks with valved respirators, saying it does more harm than good to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, the state health department said people should use only prescribed masks that are effective to stop the pandemic.

In a letter to all states and Union Territories earlier this month, Dr Rajiv Garg, Director General of Health Services (DGHS) in the health ministry, had said N-95 masks with valved respirators do not prevent the virus from spreading and are ‚Äúdetrimental‚Äù to the measures adopted for its containment.

‚ÄúIt is to bring to your knowledge that the use of valved respirator N-95 masks is detrimental to the measures adopted for preventing the spread of coronavirus as it does not prevent the virus from escaping out of the mask,‚Äù Garg wrote in the letter.

N-95 masks are suitable only for healthcare workers when they are working among those with similar masks. The valve or the raised plastic gasket found in some N95 mask models basically filters the air inhaled by the person and blocks the entry of pathogens suspended in the air. The valves allow easier exhalation than traditional masks, prevent humidity, reduce heat and carbon dioxide build-up inside the mask. Some cities, including Delhi, Indore and Bhopal, have already banned the use of such masks in public.

Talking to TOI, state health secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni said, ‚ÄúWe have already circulated the directives of the Union health ministry against the use of any kind of masks with valves as they increase the risk of infection to others.‚Äù

Dr Devesh, a public health expert and professor of preventive and social medicine at Rims, said, ‚ÄúThe primary purpose of wearing a mask is to prevent the spread of the virus from an infected person, but the N-95 has a ‚Äòone-way valve‚Äô that only protects the person wearing it and doesn‚Äôt filter the aerosols coming out. Hence, an asymptomatic carrier of the novel coronavirus can easily spread the infection to others when the valve releases the unfiltered exhaled air in the immediate surroundings.‚Äù

The health ministry has encouraged the public to use home-made face masks or coverings made of cloth, preferably cotton, which can be tied or fastened over the nose and mouth. The government has also issued a detailed manual on how to make home-made masks and recommended it to everyone.

Dr Manoj Kumar, head of Rims microbiology department said, ‚ÄúWhy do we need to use such costly N-95 masks when the triple-layer cloth made masks can do the job. Moreover, I appeal to all to wear masks in a proper manner not just for the sake of covering their faces. Wearing masks wrongly can do more harm. People should also shun the use of gamchas in place of a masks as one cannot be sure which side they are putting on the face and which side is exposed.‚Äù

298,['23/08/2020'],Cannot repay loans or pay rents if malls remain shut: Owners,"Ranchi/Bokaro: Owners of several shopping malls in the city and across the state have urged the government to allow them to resume their operations.

The mall owners decided to approach the government after a meeting convened under the banner of the Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FJCCI) on Friday.

Briefing the media after the meeting, FJCCI president Kunal Ajmani said, ‚ÄúThe state has given permission to smaller business establishments and industries to resume operations after asking them to follow the Covid-19 protocols strictly. However, the malls are closed for nearly five months and the owners are running into heavy financial losses. The government should reconsider their situation and allow them to open.‚Äù

An FJCCI statement said there are seven prominent shopping malls in the state of which three are in Ranchi, two in Jamshedpur and one each in Dhanbad and Bokaro. ‚ÄúWhile other states have permitted malls to operate, the prolonged closure in Jharkhand is making it difficult for the shop owners in the malls to repay their loans. Many of them are also staring at huge losses as their commodities are nearing expiry dates,‚Äù the statement said.

Asserting that the floor area of a mall is anywhere between 40,000-50,000 square feet, social distancing of customers will not be difficult to maintain after reopening. ‚ÄúThe shops inside these malls are small and usually have one or two salespersons. At any given point of time, there are four to five customers in a shop. Under these circumstances, social distancing can be easily maintained,‚Äù the statement added.

Vishnu Agarwal, the owner of Ranchi‚Äôs prominent Nucleus Mall, said, ‚ÄúAs many as 42 shops in Nucleus Mall have served closure notices while 27 more are contemplating to do the same. Closure of the mall is also hurting the government as it generates Rs 5 crore monthly revenue.‚Äù

Bokaro Mall is also facing similar problems with its 104 shop owners expressing their inability to pay their rents. The mall‚Äôs owner Dharmendra Jain said, ‚ÄúThe government is losing Rs 3 crore monthly in terms of GST from my mall only due to the closure. Products locked in the showrooms for months are getting spoiled. If we are allowed to open, we assure single entry and better screening. It will become difficult for us to repay bank loans without reopening.‚Äù

The government had shut the malls early in April after the pandemic reached the state and no decision to allow their reopening has been taken so far.

NEW DELHI: Barely days before the BIS standard kicks in for all toys including imported ones, PM Modi on Saturday held a meeting with senior ministers and officials to discuss ways to boost manufacturing and global imprint of Indian toys.

This is being seen as yet another bid to discourage imports from China as India is one of the largest importers of Chinese toys . Nearly 70% of imported toys are from China. The total value of imported toys was around Rs 4,000 crore in 2019-20, which is four fold more than what India exports.

""India is home to several toy clusters and thousands of artisans who produce indigenous toys which not only have cultural connect but also help in building life-skills and psychomotor skills among children at an early age,"" Modi said and added, ""such clusters should be promoted through innovative and creative methods.""

Laying emphasis on the fast growing digital gaming arena, PM said India should tap the huge potential in this area and lead the international digital gaming sector by developing games that are inspired from Indian culture and folk tales. The PM has also suggested that youth should be engaged to come up with innovative designs and toys that can instill a sense of pride towards national goals and achievements.

304,['23/08/2020'],'IS operative' held with IEDs in central Delhi,"Khan was arrested near Buddha Jayanti Park after a brief exchange of fire

NEW DELHI/LUCKNOW: The special cell of Delhi Police has arrested an alleged IS operative, Abdul Yusuf Khan alias Mustaqeem Khan (36), and claimed to have seized two improvised explosive devices packed in a pressure cooker from him. According to the police, Khan was in touch with a few online entities who are allegedly linked to IS-Khorasan Province (ISKP) through chat platforms.

He was arrested near Buddha Jayanti Park while he was going towards Karol Bagh on a bike after a brief exchange of fire in the early hours of Saturday. The IEDs were later defused at Buddha Jayanti Park in a controlled environment by the bomb disposal squad of NSG. Khan is a resident of Beshahi village in UP's Balrampur district and runs a store selling cosmetics there.

‚ÄòKhan wanted to be suicide bomber‚Äô

The police claimed that he had intended to launch a lone-wolf attack on Independence Day but had failed to do so and was looking for another opportunity. On the basis of an alert sent by the special cell, the Balrampur police has cordoned off the house of Yusuf and sealed his shop and the entire village. A team from the special cell has reached Balrampur.

Khan is alleged to have told cops that he wanted to be an ‚Äúishtishhadi warrior‚Äù or a suicide bomber, but his foreign handlers had instructed him to first execute a lone-wolf attack at a crowded place in Delhi after which he would be given permission to be a fidayee. IS wants to conduct a series of lone-wolf attacks in India in the same way that they had done in Europe.

Khan is alleged to have been in touch with ISIS entities on the web for the past five years. Initially, he had come in contact with the IS in-charge of India, Yusuf Al Hindi, through a social media handle and was radicalised and indoctrinated. However, after Al Hindi was killed in a 2017 drone strike in Syria, Khan‚Äôs ID was passed on to Al Hindi‚Äôs successor, Abu Huzaifa al Bakistani, a Pakistani national who had taught him to make IEDs. During his training, he had learnt to make suicide vests and belts too.

Police sources said Khan wanted to go to Khorasan to join the IS. He had made passports for his wife and four children but his plans had to be shelved when Bakistani was killed in a drone strike in Afghanistan last year. His ID was then passed on the present ISKP chief who instructed him to conduct an IED strike in Delhi. Khan had even tested two low-intensity IEDs at a burial ground near his house in Balrampur, police claimed.

The Balrampur police has come across a neighbour of Khan by the name of Mustaqeem Khan. Investigations are under way to establish if Khan had used his neighbour‚Äôs identity as a cover or if the latter too was involved in the crime.

A local resident told reporters that the parents of Khan had gone to lodge a missing report at the Utraula police station on Saturday morning. They claimed that Khan had gone to Lucknow on Friday morning and informed the family on phone. However, since then his number had been switched off and he had gone missing.

On Saturday evening, Yusuf was escorted by police to Beshahi village, where teams are scouring his residence for clues.

The market functioning will be reviewed after August 30 and a final decision will be taken then on whether to let them open or not.

The municipal corporations held a series of meetings on Saturday to plan the trial opening of select weekly markets. A municipal official said that the commissioner of each civic body has asked the deputy commissioner of the zone to select a weekly market for reopening each day. ""Each zone is expected to come out with a list of 5-7 markets for functioning between August 24 and 30,"" the official disclosed.

SDMC's west zone will allow markets at Shiv Nagar, Tilak Nagar, A-1 Block Janakpuri , Hari Nagar, B-1 Janakpuri, Khyala and Ashok Nagar, respectively, from Monday to Sunday. In the south zone, markets will open in Pushp Vihar, Saket (Monday), Sheikh Sarai Phase-2 (Tuesday), Gautam Nagar(Thursday), Mohammadpur, Sec-1 RK Puram (Friday) and Sector-7 RK Puram (Sunday). In Najafgarh zone, the main Najafgarh market will open on Monday while the Dwarka Mor-Kakrola market will function on Tuesday.

In north Delhi, the lists were being finalised. ""Nodal officers have been directed to be present in the weekly markets and ensure strict compliance of DDMA directions,"" a north corporation official said. The standard operating procedure will include a 6-ft distance between vendors and spaces marked for people, buyers wearing masks and total ban on spitting in the open. ""Demarcation for social distancing will be done on Sunday. A place to isolate anyone showing flu-like symptoms will also be set up,"" the official told TOI.

The weekly markets will also have markings to indicate where the physical area of the market begins and ends. A civic official said preference will be given to markets organised in relatively open spaces to allow for proper social distancing.

Arun Kumar Mishra, district magistrate (East), disclosed that police and civil defence volunteers would be deployed in the weekly markets. ""Since the weekly markets are vulnerable places in regard to Covid infection, there will be precautions and the areas where the stalls are usually set up will be sanitised before business begins,"" Mishra said.

GUWAHATI: Former Assam chief minister and veteran Congress leader Tarun Gogoi on Saturday said former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi might well be the chief ministerial candidate for the BJP in Assam in next year‚Äôs assembly polls.

309,['23/08/2020'],"After social media rage, book on 2020 Delhi riots withdrawn","File photo

NEW DELHI: Bloomsbury announced on Saturday that it was withdrawing the publication of a book on the 2020 Delhi riots . The move polarised the internet. Some commended the announcement, while others criticised it.

The now-withdrawn book, ‚ÄòDelhi Riots 2020: The Untold Story‚Äô, has been co-authored by Monika Arora, Sonali Chitalkar and Prerna Malhotra. Arora had earlier taken to Twitter to announce a virtual book launch on Saturday, where the guest of honour was BJP‚Äôs Kapil Mishra, who had allegedly made controversial remarks before northeast Delhi communal riots earlier this year.

‚ÄúBloomsbury India had planned to release ‚ÄòDelhi Riots 2020: The Untold Story‚Äô in September, a book purportedly giving a factual report on the riots in Delhi in February 2020, based on investigations and interviews conducted by the authors,‚Äù it said in a statement.

‚ÄòSupport free speech but have sense of responsibility‚Äô

In view of very recent events, including a virtual pre-publication launch organised without our knowledge by the authors, with participation by parties of whom the publishers would not have approved, we have decided to withdraw publication of the book. Bloomsbury India strongly supports freedom of speech but also has a deep sense of responsibility towards society,‚Äù the publishing house said.

Reacting to the withdrawing of the book, film director Anurag Kashyap tweeted, ‚ÄúDemocracy gives space to opinion and contrary opinion... and the way to fight it is dissent and education and it always is and will be a struggle for the truth‚Ä¶ but banning and withdrawing is not a solution in a healthy democracy‚Ä¶‚Äù Kashyap‚Äôs film, Paanch, was banned.

Some authors said they would cancel their contracts with the publishing house. ‚ÄúI have not read the book in question & have no idea if it is good or bad. However, this is obviously not a quality control problem but about censorship. I commit to never publish a book with @BloomsburyIndia,‚Äù tweeted Sanjeev Sanyal, author and principal economic adviser in the finance ministry.

Earlier, Leftword Book publisher Sudhanva Deshpande had written a blog, stating that the ‚Äúbook has blood on its hand‚Äù. ‚ÄúAm I calling for the book to be banned? No. I‚Äôm asking Bloomsbury, as a leading publisher, to ask itself what editorial protocols permit such a book to be published in such a short time? Are you as publisher not responsible for at least elementary fact checking?‚Äù he wrote.

310,['23/08/2020'],"Govt issues testing algo, not to test walk-ins, asymptomatic persons","NAGPUR: For the first time, the state government has come up with an algorithm for Covid-19 testing for laboratories and testing centres run by government agencies. Walk-ins and asymptomatic traders and travellers will not be eligible for testing which will done just once in other cases. The decision probably means that private laboratories can continue with their services.

The state‚Äôs public health department on Friday issued letters to all collectors, municipal corporations and GMCHs for immediate implementation of the algorithm prepared in conformity with ICMR guidelines.

The government agencies are conducting tests through three methods ‚Äî Real Time (RT) PCR, Rapid Antigen and True Nat. Earlier, government agencies used to follow ICMR guidelines which had no specifications regarding who should be tested through these three methods.

Now, the Rapid Antigen test should be done for those who require immediate treatment. ‚ÄúIf the Rapid Antigen test is negative, testing of only symptomatic patients should be done through RT-PCR. Testing of high-risk contacts of positive persons and foreign returnees should be done through RT-PCR,‚Äù the government said.

According to the algorithm, ‚ÄúTesting of brought dead, delivery cases and emergency operations should be done through True Nat. Such cases can be tested through Rapid Antigen only if True Nat is not available.‚Äù

The government order further states that, ‚ÄúPatients admitted in mental hospitals and prisoners in jails should be first kept in quarantine for one week. Then, they should be tested using Rapid Antigen.‚Äù

Regarding the number of tests, the government cleared its stand by stating that ‚ÄúMany districts, a patient is being tested two-three times. This is resulting in extra load on tests and the government‚Äôs finances as well. Therefore, no extra testing of patients should be done and ICMR‚Äôs protocol is to be complied with. Traders, travellers and those returning to their respective districts from other places should not be tested if they have no symptoms.‚Äù

The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), zilla parishad etc used to test high-risk contacts of positive patients with Rapid Antigen. The ZP used to test travellers and people returning from other places. The NMC had started 34 testing centres of which 15 are situated at Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHCs) for testing of symptomatic patients and the remaining for walk-ins and high risk contacts of positive patients.

The NMC had also directed shopkeepers and their staff to get tested to contain the spread. ‚ÄúNMC has been following all the guidelines issued by the government. Therefore, there is not much to change at our testing centres,‚Äù said municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe.

Two private laboratories based in the city confirmed that they will continue to test walk-ins, asymptomatic and whoever comes as they did not receive any guidelines by the government.

311,['23/08/2020'],‚ÄòDemand of parents to reduce 50% school fees is justified‚Äô,"Image is used for representational purpose only.

The ongoing tussle between parents and school managements over fee reduction in Covid times continues to simmer. Leading the charge is a graphic designer Yogesh Pathare , who formed Rashtriya Shikshak Palak Sanghatan (RSPS), an umbrella for parents of a majority of private schools. The father of two school-going children has written numerous letters to the authorities, right from the President of India Ram Nath Kovind to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Chief Justice of India Sharad Bobde to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and officials in the State Education Department.

Pathare highlighted the plight of parents, a majority of whom had either lost jobs or faced salary deduction due to the Covid crisis, but didn‚Äôt get any response. Now, he plans to take the peaceful protest to the next level in the form of an agitation at Samvidhan Square. He explains to The Times of India how private schools have indulged in profiteering and why they should pass on the benefit to parents during pandemic times.

Excerpts ...

How did Rashtriya Shikshak Palak Sanghatan start?

I am a parent and this concept clicked last year after coming into contact with many aggrieved parents on the same issue of schools hiking fees by 15% every year, which becomes unaffordable at one point of time. Since the government officials failed to give them justice as they‚Äôre hand-in-glove with the private schools, I thought of becoming their voice against exploitation by school managements. The RSPS was formed to offer a common platform to all parents in distress. I started working on it by reading laws like the Right to Education (RTE) Act. I‚Äôm in touch with parents from about top 100 schools through various What‚Äôs App groups and other social media. I have worked overseas in countries like Russia and Dubai, where the education system is totally different.

This year, parents are coming out in large numbers to protests.

They‚Äôre distraught and in grief after either facing job loss or pay cuts. Those in business haven‚Äôt earned anything since the last four months due to the lockdown. School managements should at least give this issue a thought on humanitarian grounds. Have they protested all these years, even when the management was illegally increasing the fees by 15%. The crisis made them aware of the fact that schools are literally looting them in some way or the other. Still, not a single parent is saying that they will not pay the fees. They only want 50% reduction.

According to the schools, parents are not even paying the first instalment.

That‚Äôs because they won‚Äôt be in a position to oppose the fees once they pay it. It means you‚Äôre agreeing with whatever fees the schools are charging. My advice to parents is that they shouldn‚Äôt pay the first instalment. However, I‚Äôm with the schools regarding parents clearing last year‚Äôs fees. Many schools have stopped online classes after parents failed to pay the fees. This is perpetually wrong and unethical. The education department needs to look into this aspect, but no one cares for hapless parents.

Schools say they need to pay staff salaries and also need funds for maintenance.

They‚Äôre lying in the sense that almost all have deducted teachers‚Äô salaries by more than 50%. In some schools, teachers weren‚Äôt getting salaries while many have lost their jobs. Importantly, teachers aren‚Äôt appointed by parents, so why burden them at the time of this crisis. It‚Äôs an internal issue between teachers and management. All these schools earned profits over the years, but never passed the benefits to aggrieved parents. They‚Äôre also saving a lot on electricity, water and maintenance charges in the absence of students. As per the rules, schools should hike fees once in three years, but no one follows them. Ideally, they should pass on the benefits to parents.

Why don‚Äôt parents approach the high court?

We need a proper parent-teacher association (PTA) which none of these schools have at present. They have set it up just for namesake and without following norms. As per the Fee Regulation Act, if 25% parents decide not to increase the fees then the schools need to abide by that. I‚Äôm trying to make parents aware about this aspect. The problem is that parents are apprehensive regarding their wards being targeted by the schools and therefore, they want to stay away from the judiciary or PTA. A case is already pending in the Bombay High Court related to fees and we‚Äôre waiting for the verdict.

Parents are also opposing online teaching.

A. We‚Äôre against it for students till the seventh standard as schools are using this as a ploy to exploit parents. Parents are unnecessarily being burdened as they need to purchase gadgets like laptops or mobile handsets along with Internet service providers. We‚Äôve also demanded that schools reduce 50% syllabus this year for students till the 7th standard. We‚Äôre ready if they reopen the schools in October. It will hardly make any difference.

Schools say parents shouldn‚Äôt have admitted their children if they lack funds.

They should not pass such remarks because they take government land at dirt cheap rates under the pretext of a charitable organization to start schools. They‚Äôve commercialized the noble business of education. Ask them to surrender government land and purchase a new one in market rates. When these schools began operations, the fees were very low, but multiplied over the years as neither parents nor the government opposed the move. Now, the fees are out of bounds for them.

What‚Äôs the way out of this impasse?

Only the government or schools or the judiciary have the solution. Parents are in dire straits and can‚Äôt pay the fees. Many have already cancelled their admissions from top CBSE schools and admitted their children in government schools, which is an alarming trend.

314,['23/08/2020'],Couples postponing planned pregnancies due to Covid fear,"Nagpur: While unplanned pregnancies during the Covid-19 times are on rise and baby boom is expected in the months of October/November this year, the planned pregnancies have gone down during the pandemic period.

The national trend of couples postponing plans to conceive a baby due to Covid-19 fear has caught up in Nagpur too. Many couples who were planning to have baby in 2020 have decided to wait for another six months or so.

Specialist doctors in the city have observed that there has been a significant decline in preconception consultations. ‚ÄúThe baby boom is expected because unintended pregnancies are on the rise, but at the same time those who are planning pregnancies have deferred it,‚Äù said Dr Vaidehi Marathe, president of Nagpur Obstetrics and Gynaecology Society (NOGS).

‚ÄúDoctors too are advising the same thing, especially to people taking treatment for infertility. We have told them it‚Äôs better to postpone the pregnancy for some months, until the whole picture of pandemic becomes clear,‚Äù she said.

The test tube baby centres and the infertility centres in Nagpur, which cater to patients from entire Central India, had stopped their services for at least three months during the lockdown period. Now too they are taking up very selective cases.

‚ÄúWhile most couples have decided to go ahead with the planned pregnancies, some 10% of them who read a lot about Covid-19 asked us to put their IVF plans on hold,‚Äù said Dr Natchandra Chimote, veteran infertility specialist in country.

In what he termed a unique trend, Dr Chimote said many couples who were due for IVF or IUI processes got natural pregnancies during Covid-19 lockdown. ‚ÄúThis could be due to lack of stress during initial phases of lockdown,‚Äù he said.

The picture is completely different in rural areas. ‚ÄúCouples coming from the periphery have hardly put on hold their pregnancies for Covid reason. Government hospitals have got same number of pregnancy cases during lockdown as well as unlock period,‚Äù said Dr Sajit Chavan from GMCH Yavatmal.

Doctors also agreed that deliveries are going to become a bit costlier in the coming days. ‚ÄúCost of disposables has increased the total expenses due to use of PPE and other protective gears. But it is not that significant,‚Äù said Dr Marathe.

Why pregnancy plans put off

Covid fear | Pregnancy may lead to compromised immunity

High risk | Though pregnant women not considered as high risk, people still want to be sure

NEW DELHI: Yes, there‚Äôs a pandemic, but the travel itch has returned. Because we are headed into that part of the year when cerulean skies and snow-capped peaks, sparkling lakes, forest trails and lavish sunsets begin to call. Because five months of home confinement is getting to us. Because Insta stories are wallowing in #throwback pity. And because, ‚Äúhey, do we stop living?‚Äù

The yearning to break free from work-from-home sums up the travel theme this season ‚Äì a ‚Äúdrivecation‚Äù to break the monotony (‚Äúflycation‚Äù, for those who can afford it).

316,['23/08/2020'],Why rain only hope for Delhi‚Äôs water table,"NEW DELHI: With rapid urbanisation and concretisation across the city, Delhi is increasingly restricting the recharge of its groundwater reserves. Master Plan of Delhi 2021 estimates that by 2021, around 921 of the capital‚Äôs 1,483 square kilometres will be urbanised. With the increasing rate of groundwater extraction to meet the demand-availability gap, the water table has gone down 0.2-2 metres every year.The only solution to arrest this slide is to tap what the capital can of the average 611 mm of annual rainfall. But Delhiites have a lot of ground to cover in this direction.Delhi Jal Board claims that as many as 7,373 rainwater harvesting (RWH) recharge points have been created in the city, with 544 DJB buildings, 1,305 government buildings, 3,675 schools and colleges and 1,869 private buildings installing RWH infrastructure. Private complexes are still lagging and the full potential remains untapped, despite incentives, revealed a DJB official.While DJB claims it has achieved a near completion of installation of RWH systems in all its own buildings, experts feel focusing on often illmaintained and expensive RWH structures cannot lead to a substantial amount of water percolating underground. A recent report prepared by Intach states that not only is there a need to reduce the cost of RWH units for households, but they also need to be made simpler and requirement fewer inspections and less demanding maintenance.‚ÄúIn the absence of monitoring and motivation, the recharge structures are ill-maintained and are mostly found to be non-operational,‚Äù the Intach report says. ‚ÄúThe design of recharge structures can be simplified, made economical, accompanied by lower maintenance cost. At plot level, there is no need of filter material as fine material is filtered out by the bed soil of recharge pits and there is no need for bore pipe as once the water has gone 2 metres below the soil, it will percolate on its own.‚ÄùManu Bhatnagar, principal director (natural heritage), Intach, explained, ‚ÄúThe more complex RWH units require gravel and silt to be removed periodically. The simple need is simply to channel the run-off water to a pit and allow it to percolate naturally into the ground.‚ÄùA report prepared by South Delhi Municipal Corporation showed that between 2012 and 2019, as many as 11,342 building plans with RWH provisions were sanctioned in south Delhi alone. DJB too has more than 15,706 such plots of 100-500 sq m registered in its revenue management system for whom it is mandatory to install RWH systems. Under regulation 50 of Delhi Water and Sewer (Tariff and Metering) Regulations, such plots can be given a rebate of 10% in the water bill if they installed RWH, while those that didn‚Äôt faced a penalty 1.5 times the bill amount. In August last year, DJB amended the rules to make it mandatory for all properties 100 sq m and above to have functional RWH systems. Compliance, however, has been much lower than the expectations.The Jal Shakti Abhiyan action taken report and Delhi‚Äôs economic survey of 2019 revealed a very low level of compliance, with just 1,559 consumers availing the 10% water bill rebate by installing RWH systems, and 11,958 consumers being penalised for non-compliance. Experts attribute the repeated deadline extensions given to enforce the penalty for the poor show. A DJB official said that the board in its meeting on 12 June has decided again to extend the deadline for levying of the RWH noncompliance penalty till December 31. ‚ÄúNine rain centres have been opened in each district to encourage owners of property of 100 sq m or more to comply,‚Äù the official said.It is estimated that Delhi‚Äôs annual RWH potential is 900 billion litres of water, while that for rooftop harvesting is 27 million litres per day. If Delhi wishes to be hydrologically sustainable, rainwater harvesting has to become a part of the agenda.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77699074,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-266593,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-rain-only-hope-for-delhis-water-table/articleshow/77699060.cms

CHANDIGARH: Municipal commissioner K K Yadav has asked the chief engineer for a detailed status report of the development works at vending zones. The tender was called earlier this year but the work has failed to start because of the Covid-19 pandemic .

Permanent and temporary toilets, drinking water, parking lots for both vendors and visitors, iron railing as fence, signs, marked bays, and high-mast lights are some of the facilities being provided by the engineering wing. The financial cost is about Rs 5 crore.

Since the money will come from the monthly fee that the vendors pay, the MC doesn't need a separate budget for these development works. Rather, there is no financial hitch. A source in the MC said: ‚ÄúThe town vending committee (TVC) looked at the vending-zone plan, after which the municipal commissioner asked the chief engineer for a detailed status report of the works. Since the engineering department is over with the tender process, they must explain the delay.‚Äù

Chandigarh has 44 vending zones and more than 4,000 vending sites in different sectors. The developmental plan for each site is based on zones classified by size, number of resettled vendors, and their necessity. The plan came up after doing a ground survey, considering objections from the vendors and the general public, and studying the basic requirements.

Since the matter was also discussed many times in the monthly house meetings of the MC, the councillors also added their inputs to the plan.

In Bankura alone, around 15 villages ‚Äî including Jambani and Aralbanshi ‚Äî are now marooned, as a temporary bridge over river Darakeshwar at Minapur went underwater following torrential rain on Saturday morning.

Hundreds of villagers have been forced to move 5km away from the area. ‚ÄúThe bridge was constructed in 2011. The morning downpour snapped our lifeline,‚Äù said local resident Haradhan Garai.

The Bankura district administration has warned people against the rising water level of Gandheswari as well. District magistrate S Arun Prasad said: ‚ÄúThe situation is being closely monitored.‚Äù

Erosion of embankments at Kulidiar Char in Farakka and Dhanghora at Samserganj in Murshidabad has set off alarm bells too. The state irrigation department has begun repairs at Dhanghora, from where 300 families were shifted because their homes were flooded.

In Howrah, the rising waters of the Rupnarayan and Mundeswari rivers have submerged 700 acres of land in Bhatora and Ghoraberia-Chi-ntan gram panchayat. These areas are on an island, which is home to 60,000-odd people. Embankments lie eroded.

Local panchayat functionaries Ashok Gayen and Palash Majhi said vast swathes of agricultural land in these areas are underwater.

Kalimul Haque is the headmaster of Nepalipara Hindi School in Durgapur, West Burdwan, while Misha Ghosal is the headmistress of Dhanapati Toto Memorial High School in Alipurduar‚Äôs Totopara.

Had it not been for Haque, the nondescript Durgapur school wouldn‚Äôt boast the enviable infrastructure it has today. The school has a centralised audio system, a rooftop kitchen garden, hydroponics, a rainwater harvesting system, a vermicompost set-up, solid and liquid waste management, a well-maintained dining hall, a computer lab with 30 machines, a 500-seat auditorium and an art gallery.

At Haque‚Äôs initiative, key resource persons train teachers too. Around 40% funds for these projects were raised through crowdfunding, with contributions from businessmen and businesswomen, guardians, teachers and the school managing committee. The school, with 3,625 students, has won several district-level awards.

‚ÄúI feel really proud that my name figures on the list of winners for this year‚Äôs National Awards for Teachers. But, the key to the school‚Äôs success is team work. I will dedicate this award to those who helped the school, teachers, students and management committee members,‚Äù a modest Haque told TOI.

In Alipurduar, Ghosal joined the Toto school in 2009. Back then, only one student from the primitive tribe was able to cross the Madhyamik hurdle. This year, the success rate of students from the community is over 80%. She almost single-handedly turned around things for the school, which remains marooned every monsoon along with the entire Totopara settlement. ‚ÄúMy responsibilities as a teacher has increased after being named for this award,‚Äù she said.

Totopara is a small hamlet in Madarihat block along the India-Bhutan border. One needs to cross seven rivers to reach the village, the most prominent being the Howrikhola. During monsoons, flash floods are common in these rivers.

324,['23/08/2020'],Kolkata: Schools seek legal aid to make admission undertakings tougher,"Image used for representational purpose only

KOLKATA: Several reputable private schools in the city are in the process of seeking legal advice on including in their existing ‚Äúadmission affidavits‚Äù clauses that would pre-empt parents‚Äô involvement in agitations and spell out permissible school-related online activities.

There is growing resentment among these schools about parents taking part in protests and bringing disrepute to their institution by ‚Äúbadmouthing‚Äù them on social media. The situation has particularly aggravated following the recent row over school fees.

The principal of a school, which has several branches in Bengal, admitted that the authorities had started consultation with the legal team to introduce stipulations to make parents abide by rules that the school sets and amends from time to time. ‚ÄúAgitating against the school, tarnishing the brand name of the institution that has been serving in the state for decades will not be tolerated. We are planning to introduce the clause for the 2021-22 session,‚Äù he said.

Some schools that already take undertakings from parents at the time of admission, are now planning to make changes in the clauses considering the new-age disruptions. ‚ÄúWe have to discuss in the managing committee meeting if we can introduce new guidelines considering the need of the hour so that we can protect the value of the school and the reputation that we have built over the past 60 years,‚Äù said Don Bosco, Park Circus principal Fr Bikash Mondal.

Another popular CISCE school near Moulali, which does not seek an undertaking, is planning to introduce one now. ‚ÄúLooking at the current trend, where imparting education is becoming increasingly difficult due to the continuous pressure from parents, unjustified protests and demands and political interference, we are planning to introduce an undertaking to be signed by parents at the time of new admissions from the next academic year. It will have clauses like no-demonstration or protests in groups. Parents can‚Äôt instigate others by forming groups on Whatsapp and other social media platforms. They should give us in writing that they will not seek political interference during any interaction or issues with the school that can be resolved in a civilised manner. Consultations are on with legal experts,‚Äù the principal said.

St. Augustine‚Äôs Day School, Kolkata, has been asking parents to give such an undertaking for a few years now. Principal Richard Gasper said, ‚ÄúWe have asked parents to declare that their children will not abuse parents of other students; students can‚Äôt bring outsiders; in case of attempted suicide outside the campus, the school can‚Äôt be held; consumption of alcohol and nicotine on the campus is strictly prohibited; damaging school property, tarnishing the name of the school on social media and spreading rumours are also banned.‚Äù

The La Martiniere Schools provide an affidavit at the time of admission that parents need to execute in the presence of a first-class judicial magistrate. The fifth clause in the affidavit says parents will have to abide by all fees, charges and payments required to be paid both prevailing and/or to be enforced or implemented or issued from time to time. ‚ÄúWe have this format for the past few years that parents have to sign during admissions,‚Äù said Supriyo Dhar, secretary of the La Martiniere Schools.

Nabarun De, the principal of Central Modern School in Baranagar, however, pointed out that there is no legal tenability of such an undertaking. ‚ÄúWe are seeking the advice of cyber cell experts and lawyers to understand what can be the possible format of an affidavit regarding maligning the school on social media platforms and refusal to abide by the school rules,‚Äù he added.

I-Pac has been spearheading an online campaign ‚Äî Youth in Politics (YIP) ‚Äî in which 40% of the 10-lakh odd applicants were from Bengal. Of them, 80% expressed interest in joining the ruling Trinamool. According to sources, YIP aims to bridge the gap between the average electorate age of 28 in the country and the average age of public representatives, which is 53.

‚ÄúWest Bengal alone recorded around 4 lakh registrations, out of which many expressed an interest in starting their journey in electoral politics with Trinamool Congress,‚Äù a source said. ‚ÄúThe age group that has expressed maximum interest is 26-29 years. About 30% of the applicants were in this group,‚Äù a source said.

On Sunday, Trinamool leaders across 14 districts, including Kolkata, will interact with these applicants to guide them into active politics. MP Mahua Moitra in Nadia, minister Laxmi Ratan Shukla in Howrah, KMC Board of Administrators member Debashish Kumar in Kolkata, MP Mausam Noor in Malda and state food minister Jyotipriyo Mullick in North 24 Parganas will be part of this ‚ÄòInteraction and Joining‚Äô event. Senior party MP Sisir Adhikari will be attending the programme in East Midnapore.

‚ÄúThe aim of this initiative is to motivate, handhold and provide mentorship to those who aspire to join politics and work for West Bengal. I-Pac will act as a facilitator in this endeavour, helping these individuals kick-start their journey in politics,‚Äù an I-Pac statement said.

A senior leader said the party had already started recruiting apolitical persons. In August, Trinamool inducted Chandrasekhar Kundu, who has been at the forefront of the ‚ÄòSave Food‚Äô movement that stopped the wastage of over 3 lakh plates of food. Folk singers Kartik Das Baul and Lakhan Das Baul, laparoscopy surgeon and gynaecologist Badal Asru Ghata and Raniganj Chambers of Commerce president Sandeep Bh-alotia have also joined TMC.

A Trinamool leader said the trend to return to the party, even among senior political leaders and ground-level workers, had been palpable. It began with brothers Biplab and Prasanta Mitra, who returned a year after going to BJP. Biplab is a former TMC MLA from Harirampur and former South Dinajpur district president; Prasanta is the former chairman of Gangarampur municipality. Former state minister Humayun Kabir and former BJP spokesperson Krishanu Mitra, too, joined Trinamool.

Even at the grassroots, more than 450 families in Purulia‚Äôs Baghmundi, 350 families in Hooghly, 500 workers in Coochbehar, 270 workers in Howrah South and 1,500 in South 24 Parganas joined Trinamool in the past week alone, the leader said.

MOHALI: In a horrifying incident captured on CCTV , a car crushed a stray dog in Phase 3B1 around 4pm on Thursday. The runaway driver was booked.

Mowgli Aid volunteers Aman Sethi and Sahib Kunwar Singh mention in their complaint that this beastly driver ran the male canine over repeatedly, with the clear intent of causing maximum injury. The driver did not even stop to look at the poor animal, which died in 20 minutes. Sethi and Kunwar gave a written complaint to the Mataur station house officer (SHO).

They sourced the CCTV footage from a nearby house and it has gone viral on social media. Sethi told TOI: ‚ÄúIt was a narrow lane and the driver should have been extra careful. The act was inhuman.‚Äù

Sub-inspector Amandeep Singh, investigating officer of the case, said: ‚ÄúThe car's Haryana registration number will help us trace the culprit, whom we have booked under sections 279 (rash driving), 290 (punishment for public nuisance), and 429 (killing of animal) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 11 (cruel treatment of an animal) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960.

Karanveer, another volunteer from Mowgli Aid, said: ‚ÄúThere is no local SPCA ( Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ) or animal rescue service in Mohali . Volunteers do everything to save the animals. In Thursday's matter, we were lucky to get the footage as evidence but most of the time, that's not the case.

NEW DELHI/LUCKNOW: The special cell of Delhi Police has arrested an alleged IS operative, Abdul Yusuf Khan alias Mustaqeem Khan (36), and claimed to have seized two improvised explosive devices packed in a pressure cooker from him. According to the police, Khan was in touch with a few online entities who are allegedly linked to IS-Khorasan Province (ISKP) through chat platforms.

He was arrested near Buddha Jayanti Park while he was going towards Karol Bagh on a bike after a brief exchange of fire in the early hours of Saturday. The IEDs were later defused at Buddha Jayanti Park in a controlled environment by the bomb disposal squad of NSG. Khan is a resident of Beshahi village in UP‚Äôs Balrampur district and runs a store selling cosmetics there.

The police claimed that he had intended to launch a lone-wolf attack on Independence Day but had failed to do so and was looking for another opportunity. On the basis of an alert sent by the special cell, the Balrampur police has cordoned off the house of Yusuf and sealed his shop and the entire village. A team from the special cell has reached Balrampur.

Khan is alleged to have told cops that he wanted to be an ‚Äúishtishhadi warrior‚Äù or a suicide bomber, but his foreign handlers had instructed him to first execute a lone-wolf attack at a crowded place in Delhi after which he would be given permission to be a fidayee. IS wants to conduct a series of lone-wolf attacks in India in the same way that they had done in Europe.

Khan is alleged to have been in touch with ISIS entities on the web for the past five years. Initially, he had come in contact with the IS in-charge of India, Yusuf Al Hindi, through a social media handle and was radicalised and indoctrinated. However, after Al Hindi was killed in a 2017 drone strike in Syria, Khan‚Äôs ID was passed on to Al Hindi‚Äôs successor, Abu Huzaifa al Bakistani, a Pakistani national who had taught him to make IEDs. During his training, he had learnt to make suicide vests and belts too.

Police sources said Khan wanted to go to Khorasan to join the IS. He had made passports for his wife and four children but his plans had to be shelved when Bakistani was killed in a drone strike in Afghanistan last year. His ID was then passed on the present ISKP chief who instructed him to conduct an IED strike in Delhi. Khan had even tested two low-intensity IEDs at a burial ground near his house in Balrampur, police claimed.

The Balrampur police has come across a neighbour of Khan by the name of Mustaqeem Khan. Investigations are under way to establish if Khan had used his neighbour‚Äôs identity as a cover or if the latter too was involved in the crime.

A local resident told reporters that the parents of Khan had gone to lodge a missing report at the Utraula police station on Saturday morning. They claimed that Khan had gone to Lucknow on Friday morning and informed the family on phone. However, since then his number had been switched off and he had gone missing.

On Saturday evening, Yusuf was escorted by police to Beshahi village, where teams are scouring his residence for clues.

AHMEDABAD: Compared to swine flu (H1N1) that claimed high mortality among pregnant women , the Covid-19 pandemic has proved to be kinder to moms-to-be. A study carried out by a team of gynaecologists at AMC-run SVP Hospital attached with NHL Municipal Medical College found that none of the 125 Covid-19 positive expectant mothers who were admitted died of the virus illness.The 125 pregnant women were studied to understand the impact of Covid-19 infection.The period of study witnessed 94 live births, two deaths after delivery and three abortions. In 23 women, the pregnancy was continued. The live births included two twins. All were tested for Covid-19 infection and only 16 were found to be positive. No maternal death was recorded, according to the paper published in International Journal Of Reproduction, Contraception, Obstetrics and Gynecology.The team of researchers included Dr Parul Shah, Dr Sapana Shah, Dr Sushma Shah, Dr Pushpa Yadav, Dr Babulal Patel and Dr Tanmay Chudasama from Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, NHLMC.The study reported that three-fourth pregnant women were in the age group of 21 to 30 years. In 31% of the cases, women had contact history with a positive person. Cough and fever were the most reported symptoms. 'Out of total, 38% women were asymptomatic,‚Äô mentioned the paper. About 60% of the women were in their third trimester.In 16 cases, pregnancy-related complications were reported but were not related to Covid-19 infection and were managed well with conventional treatment plans, said researchers. Thirty were given corticosteroids and 19 were administered hydroxychloroquine. Only three women needed ICU admission.Talking about the impact of Covid-19, researchers mentioned that elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) was recorded in 64% of patients.In 19 of the patients, lung patches were found in CT scan and SGPT levels were found shooting up in 36% of patients.‚ÄòCurrently, there is no evidence that pregnant women are at greater risk to succumb to COVID-19 infection and experience severe pneumonia.This preliminary study however does not rule out the possibility of vertical transmission of SARSCoV-2 when it manifests towards the end of pregnancy,‚Äô mentioned the findings of the study, adding that no increased risk of spontaneous abortion or preterm delivery was found among the positive patients.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77699115,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-82954,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-covid-kinder-to-pregnant-women-says-study/articleshow/77699114.cms

NEW DELHI: Arindam Chaudhuri , director of Indian Institute of Planning and Management (IIPM) and another director of his company have been arrested by the CGST South Delhi Commissionerate for wrongfully claiming cenvat of service tax credit in the pre-GST regime, reports Surojit Gupta.

Sources said the once high-profile Chaudhuri and his colleague were arrested at 4 pm on Friday. A local court sent them to 14 days custody. The duo has been detained in the case, which involves an amount of more than Rs 22.5 crore. They were produced before duty magistrate Jyoti Maheshwari in Patiala House Court. Probe is on about properties held by Chaudhuri and his company in Delhi and other cities in the country as well as overseas.

Until a few years ago Chaudhuri was a regular on television channels.

Sources said Chaudhuri owns 90% of the closely held company while the rest is held by his wife. In 2018, an indirect tax tribunal upheld the entire service tax demand against IIPM saying there was no scope to exclude ‚Äúacademic courses‚Äù conducted by the institute from the levy of the tax demand. Sources said the probes would also include the alleged service tax evasion angle.

Referring to the order of the tribunal, officials had said the total tax demand including penalty and interest could be over Rs 200 crore.

BHOPAL: The CBI on Saturday registered an FIR against the directors of Madhya Pradesh-based K S Oils Ltd in an alleged Rs 938 crore bank loan scam .

‚ÄúIt was alleged that the forensic audit findings indicated that the financials of the company, while applying for loan, were inflated, and that the loan amount was misappropriated through fraudulent diversion,‚Äù said an official release. Searches were conducted on Saturday in Morena and Delhi at the premises of the firm. K S Oils Ltd has manufacturing plants in Morena, Ratlam and Guna in Madhya Pradesh , Kota in Rajasthan and a port-based refinery in Haldia, West Bengal.

‚ÄòFinancials of the oil firm were inflated‚Äô

In 2015, banks tried to recover their loss by auctioning their assets under the SARFAESI Act but failed due to ‚Äúunsatisfactory response to the bid process‚Äù, says the statement.

338,['23/08/2020'],"Police shoot, kill Black man outside store in Louisiana","LAFAYETTE (US): The mother of a man fatally shot by Louisiana police said her son was intelligent, shy and had sought therapy for social anxiety. Her lawyers said they plan to sue over the death of Trayford Pellerin , who police said had a knife and was trying to enter a convenience store.

The shooting Friday night was captured on video, and the state ACLU condemned what it described as a ``horrific and deadly incident of police violence against a Black person.'' Both the ACLU and the Southern Poverty Law Center on Saturday called for an investigation.

Louisiana State Police said Lafayette officers followed Pellerin, 31, on foot as he left a convenience store where he had created a disturbance with a knife about 8 pm Friday. Stun guns failed to stop him, and the officers shot Pellerin as he tried to enter another convenience store, still with the knife, according to a news release.

Pellerin became anxious in groups and may have been frightened by the officers, Michelle Pellerin told The Advocate. He had sought professional help earlier this year, she said.

``Instead of giving him a helping hand they gave him bullets,'' national civil rights attorney Ben Crump told the newspaper. He and Baton Rouge attorney Ronald Haley said they have begun their own investigation by interviewing witnesses. Some said Pellerin was not armed, Haley said.

The family believes Pellerin may have been having a mental health crisis, Crump said.

Lafayette police asked state police to investigate- standard procedure in the state for shootings by local officers.

``Lafayette police shot Mr. Pellerin several times as he walked away from them,'' Margaret Huang, president and CEO of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said in an emailed statement. ``His killing demands an analysis of the excessive use of force by law enforcement. We fully support movement leaders' calls for a swift and transparent investigation into Mr. Pellerin's killing.''

State ACLU executive director Alanah Odoms Hebert said, ``Once again, video footage has captured a horrific and deadly incident of police violence against a Black person who was brutally killed in front of our eyes.''

Captured on video, the May 25 death of George Floyd under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer sparked a global reckoning over police tactics and racial injustice. On Saturday night, dozens of protesters gathered in Lafayette to demonstrate against the latest fatal police shooting.

``Trayford Pellerin should be alive today. Instead, a family is mourning and a community is grieving,`` her statement said. ``None of our communities are safe when the police can murder people with impunity or when routine encounters escalate into deadly shooting sprees.''

Rikasha Montgomery, who took a video of the shooting, told The Advertiser that a man holding what looked like a knife kept walking down the highway while some officers fired stun guns at him. Officers holding guns shouted at him to get onto the ground, said Montgomery, 18.

She said they fired when the man reached the door of a Shell gas station.

``When I heard the gunshots, I couldn't hold my phone like I was first filming,'' she said. ``I feel kind of scared about it. I'm traumatized. You're so used to hearing about this, but I never thought I would experience it.''

Crump, representing Pellerin's family, called the shooting reckless and his death tragic.

``The officers involved should be fired immediately for their abhorrent and fatal actions,'' Crump said in a statement Saturday.

The incident was the third shooting by Lafayette police since mid-July. State police said a man was critically wounded last month after being shot during an altercation with police. Another man was in stable condition after being shot during a burglary investigation earlier this month.

Haley told The Advocate that he and Crump will be seeking reform and policy changes in the police department as well as damages.

``We want policy changes as well, so that Ben and I are not in the living room with another family in Lafayette dealing with this,'' Haley said.

The road, railways, shipping and civil aviation ministries have prepared a detailed connectivity roadmap for these economic zones such as food and agro zones, fishing and defence clusters, electronic, textile and pharmaceutical parks.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a review meeting on the preparation of the Master Plan on Monday and tweeted that the move will boost productivity, infrastructure, economic progress and opportunities for youngsters.

Sources said seven infrastructure ministries and seven others joined hands to prepare the National Master Plan with the view to align efforts of each ministry or department with a national perspective. The plan also aims to ensure that all missing gaps are removed for seamless movement of people, goods and services within a given time frame so far as connectivity is concerned.

TOI has learnt that three big industrial areas at Krishnapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, Tumkur in Karnataka and Dadri in Uttar Pradesh have been identified under this plan as well.

The government has identified the industries that would come up at these three big industrial areas and these include food products, textiles, electronics, automobiles, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and cold storage.

‚ÄúThe main objective of preparing the Master Plan is to guide departments and ministries while they are planning individual projects. This will also ensure aligning the funding of projects by ministries as per the Master Plan. The logistics department will coordinate with the respective ministries to make the plan better,‚Äù said a source.

Sources said to improve connectivity, the road transport ministry has said construction of more highways including economic corridors would cater to the needs for economic zones while Indian Railways has planned to increase cargo handling by at least 33% by 2024, which will ensure faster movement of raw and finished material and would also reduce logistics cost.

344,['23/08/2020'],US snubbed again; 13 of UNSC‚Äôs 15 nations oppose push for Iran sanctions,"NEW YORK: The US was further isolated on Friday over its bid to reimpose international sanctions on Iran with 13 countries on the 15-member UN Security Council expressing their opposition, arguing that Washington‚Äôs move is void given it is using a process agreed under a nuclear deal that it quit two years ago.

In the 24 hours since US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said he triggered a 30-day countdown to a return of UN sanctions on Iran, including an arms embargo, long-time allies Britain, France, Germany and Belgium as well as China, Russia, Vietnam, Niger, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, South Africa, Indonesia, Estonia and Tunisia have already written letters in opposition.

The US has accused Iran of breaching a 2015 deal with world powers that aimed to stop Tehran developing nuclear weapons in return for sanctions relief. Diplomats said Russia, China and many other countries are unlikely to reimpose the sanctions on Iran. Pompeo again warned Russia and China against that on Friday, threatening US action if they refuse to reimpose the UN measures on Iran.

The US acted on Thursday after the Security Council rejected its bid last week to extend an arms embargo on Iran beyond its expiration in October. Only the Dominican Republic joined Washington in voting 'yes.' It has not yet written to the council to state its position. Under the process Washington says it has triggered, it appears all UN sanctions should be reimposed at midnight on September 19 ‚Äî just days before President Trump is due to address world leaders at the UN General Assembly, the annual meeting that will be largely virtual

LUCKNOW: After five hours of sitting on a dharna with over 400 people at Imambara Ghufranmaab, Maulana Kalbe Jawad late on Saturday night said the state government had assured them that no one would stop people from keeping taziyas at home. Besides, there would be no problem in performing other Muharram rituals at home across the state, he added.

‚ÄúHome secretary SK Bhagat has been appointed to oversee that there is no issue created over majlis at home. All district magistrates and SSPs were also informed by the bureaucrat about the same. Names and contacts of clerics across UP have also been asked for which we will provide by Sunday morning. By noon, all taziyas which were taken away by police anywhere will also be returned to homes,‚Äù the cleric said while addressing those present in the dharna.

The clerics had alleged that people were not being allowed to keep paper-made taziyas at home.

Over the matter of attendees in majlis, the cleric said that the main issue had been resolved on Saturday and a case had already been filed in court. ‚ÄúWe have appealed that the number of attendees should be relative to the space where the majlis is to be held. Until then online majlis will continue,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúA report from Allahabad claimed that police were stopping women from holding majlis inside their home among family members. If any such activity is witnessed anywhere, we will approach the government,‚Äù said Jawad.

Earlier, addressing the media, the cleric had said he had received thousands of calls from across UP about the government‚Äôs restrictions on majlis.

A number of Shia clerics had approached both the central and state governments for permission to hold majlis while adhering to Covid-19 protocol.

‚ÄúWe sought permission for physical attendance of 1,000 people in majlis with proper social distancing as imambaras have huge space. However, the government brought the number down to just 20 attendees. We even agreed to that but an order sent out late Thursday night allowed just five attendees in person at each majlis, that too at only seven imambaras of the city,‚Äù the cleric said.

AMRITSAR: Five armed intruders attempting to infiltrate into Punjab from Pakistan were shot dead by personnel of Border Security Force in Tarn Taran district in an operation that started from late on Friday night and lasted for almost 10 hours.A patrolling party of the BSF‚Äôs 103 Battalion observed suspicious movement near the border ahead of the security fence in Amarkot area of Tarn Taran district late on Friday night. The troops cordoned off the area and challenged the intruders to stop and surrender. However, the intruders continued to move towards the border fence and also opened fire at the BSF team intermittently, BSF IG, Punjab Frontier, Mahipal Yadav said on Saturday.In retaliatory fire, the BSF personnel killed the five intruders. ‚ÄúThe last bullet was shot at 5.30 am following which a search operation was launched,‚Äù said Yadav. During the search operation, five bodies were recovered along with around 10 kg heroin, one AK-47 rifle, two magazines and 27 live rounds, four Beretta 9mm pistols with seven magazines and 109 live rounds, two mobile phones and 610 Pakistani rupees in cash, he added. The Punjab border with Pakistan is the most vulnerable to drug smuggling as the BSF has seized almost 360kg of heroin this year till August 22. In Punjab, the BSF has the mandate to guard the 553-km Indo-Pakistan border ‚Äî the land border is 518 km.Sources revealed that BSF would hold a flag meeting with Pakistan Rangers to hand over a protest note over the infiltration bid. The BSF has shot dead a total of 15 Pakistani nationals at the border in Punjab this year.No contact persons of the Pakistani intruders on the Indian side were noticed at the border either to receive them, in case of infiltration bid, or to receive the consignment of narcotics. ‚ÄúProbably they got a wink of our operation and fled,‚Äù the sources said. From their clothes, the intruders didn‚Äôt appear to be just couriers of narcotics, the sources added.Yadav said the BSF had handed over the bodies to Punjab police, which would investigate their identities, check the data in their phones and look into details of their activities.There is no clarity whether the intruders were smuggling heroin or the drugs were a cover for other covert activity.Former BSF officials, who have served in Punjab Frontier, said on Saturday that in no smuggling bid till now have all cross-border smugglers been armed. ‚ÄúI think 10 kg heroin recovered from the encounter site is just a cover to divert the course of investigations in case the intruders were arrested. The actual motive seems to be something else and needs to be investigated,‚Äù former BSF deputy inspector-general J S Saran told TOI. ‚ÄúIn smuggling attempts normally, one of every three smugglers is armed and in case anyone is shot by BSF, the rest flee back, which did not happen in this case. Here all five of them were heavily armed and chose to die over fleeing, which also indicates their motivational level and a hidden motive.‚ÄùFormer BSF inspector-general, Punjab Frontier, M S Malhi also said this was ‚Äúnot a normal smuggling bid where five heavily armed persons are killed. Even if we check the past records, there will hardly by any similar example.‚Äù He did not rule out the possibility of support of Pakistani Rangers in pushing these intruders into India. ‚ÄúIn many cases, they (Pakistani smugglers/ intruders) often get their support.‚ÄùThere could be a possibility that these intruders were on a mission such as targeted killing in India, said Malhi, adding that they could have been carrying heroin for financial support till they accomplished their mission in India. ‚ÄúTheir motive is a question of investigations,‚Äù he said.",amritsar,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77699319,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-320357,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/five-armed-intruders-from-pakistan-shot-dead-at-border/articleshow/77699317.cms

NOIDA: The gang that cheated investors with franchise offers for a supermarket had floated a few other such startups to park their money.

The companies included Midway Caf√©, Westland Trade Private Limited, Dachfenster Media Private Limited, Southland Retail Private Limited and a franchise for Louis Salon .

According to the website of the ministry of corporate affairs, the Hyper Supermarket, with which they cheated the investors, was incorporated in June 2019 and Westland Trade in April 2019. Several promotional videos of the supermarket chain, however, claim that the company was formed in 2011.

Krishna Yadav, one of the first complainants in the case, said he had visited a Hyper store in east Delhi before signing the agreement.

‚ÄúThe marketing head and other employees who met me at the company‚Äôs office in Noida Sector 63 had asked me to visit the store. It became non-functional after that,‚Äù he added.

Information about directors on the ministry website shows that Arman Patel, Sanjay and Anuj Singh headed Hyper Supermarket. The directors of Westland Trade Private Limited are Kunal Keshav and Manish Dahiya, according to the website. Similarly, Midway Caf√© Limited was incorporated in April 2019 but on its website, it claims to be the fastest growing franchise in India since 1999.

The ministry website mentions its directors as Vijay Singh and Devender Khatri. Another company that was formed by the name of Dachfenster Private Limited in February 2015 in Kolkata had Anbir and Bhumesh as the directors.

The gang also formed Southland Retail Private Limited, which was used to promote Louis Salon. They described the company as the ‚ÄúUS-based branch with around 4,000 luxury salons‚Äù.

Noida police said the names of the directors were fake. ‚ÄúThese are fake companies created to offer franchise models to investors and park their money,‚Äù additional DCP (central Noida) Ankur Aggarwal said.

The police also said that fake documents were used to float these companies. ‚ÄúThe accused have used different photographs and fake ID proofs to forge PAN cards, aadhaar cards, etc and open bank accounts,‚Äù DCP (central Noida) Harish Chander said.

The employees of the company, who were involved in calling up investors and luring them, have not been arrested yet.

‚ÄúUnder the prevalent Covid-19 pandemic for any person to behave in such an irresponsible manner needs to be deprecated in strong terms. The medical and para-medical staff in the state of Punjab as also across the country is working round the clock to fight the pandemic. There is a certain protocol to be observed regarding conduct of ‚ÄòCovid test‚Äô and in the eventuality of there being a ‚ÄòCovid‚Äô death, certain precautionary measures have to be followed,‚Äù observed Justice Tejinder Singh Dhindsa who passed the order while hearing a petition filed by Sandeep Kaur, a resident of Barnala, seeking anticipatory bail.

She was booked by cops on June 25 under Sections 297/454/353/186/342/270/120-B/ 188 of IPC, Section 4 of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984 and Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, registered at Barnala city police station.

The police claimed that the petitioner was part of a group which forcibly removed a body from the mortuary and the body was that of her cousin. As per the investigating agency, presence of the petitioner while removing the body stands recorded in CCTV footage. The FIR includes allegations that a group of persons locked certain staff of medical and para-medical team inside a room and removed the body of one Balwinder Singh from the mortuary.

‚ÄòPetitioner booked on basis of video‚Äô

On the first date of hearing in the HC, the counsel for the petitioner made a submission that the petitioner was not related to the person whose body was taken away from the mortuary and that the FIR has been lodged against unknown and unrelated persons. Hearing her contention, the HC asked Punjab to file a reply as regards the evidence on the basis of which the petitioner was made an accused.

During the hearing of the case on August 19, the Punjab government informed the court that a video clip of the incident was recorded and in that video the petitioner was duly identified. On this, the counsel for the petitioner conceded that Balwinder Singh whose body was removed from the mortuary was first cousin of the petitioner.

After hearing all the parties, the HC observed that as per allegations, the petitioner was part of a group which removed her cousin‚Äôs body from the mortuary.

According to the police, the miscreants entered the financier‚Äôs house on Friday morning and looted gold and silver jewellery and Rs 3 lakh cash from his wife and son at gunpoint. But, in the meantime, the house owner happened to returnand gave a hot chase to the trio fleeing on a scooty.

The scooty rider lost control of the two-wheeler after some distance and the three miscreants fell down. Then they opened fire on a motorcyclist and snatched his bike. But, since the road was not motorable, they finally dumped the bike and started running. By now, local persons and police were also following their trail. Suddenly, one of the trio whipped out a weapon, fearing being caught, shot himself in the head, while the police nabbed the other two.

The dead man was identified as Robin, a resident of Jind, and his two accomplices as Ajay from Jind, and Pawan, a Tohana resident.The loot and two pistols were recovered from them.

BARNALA: Keeping a junior engineer (JE) of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) in ‚Äúcustody‚Äù for hours for a minor accident involving a policeman near the Barnala City police station proved costly for the cops. When PSPCL authorities went to get the JE released, they noticed that the police station was drawing power through a ""kundi"" connection.

A PSPCL raid the following day found four air-conditioners running on the ""kundi"" connection. The police station was imposed Rs 2.25 lakh fine.

JE Kulbir Singh said, ""I was going to the market in my car on Thursday when the driver of the car ahead of me stopped suddenly. I braked to avoid ramming into it and a policeman who was on a bike behind me hit my car and fell down.

Two policemen took me to the police station, abused me and kept me in illegal confinement for hours till late night. They let me go only after more employees and my family members reached the police station,"" said Jagdeep Singh.

PSPCL SDO Vikas Singla said when officials checked the connection on Friday, it was found to be illegal. ""We calculated the loss to PSPCL and imposed a fine of Rs 2.25 lakh,"" he said.

When contacted, Barnala DSP Rashpal Singh Dhindsa said there is an electricity meter in the police station, but it was possible there were bill arrears.

He said they had not received any notice or fine for the ""kundi"" connection.

GURUGRAM: A shopping list in hand, Ana Lalrindiki and her friend walked into Ambience Mall on Saturday morning and were relieved to find it unusually empty. When they reached the main entrance, the guard stopped them and said the mall was closed. As they started discussing which other mall they could visit, the guard interrupted: ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, all malls in the city are closed.‚Äù

Like Ana, many shoppers in the city were in for a rude shock on Saturday morning after learning about the Haryana government‚Äôs order to impose a weekend lockdown. Since the order came late on Friday evening, most residents were caught unawares.

While malls and offices remained shut, grocery stores, pharmacies, bakeries and meat shops were exempted from the restrictions as they fall under the category of essential goods.

Most of the shoppers expressed disappointment with the order. They said since the entire week was spent working from home, weekend was the only time they could step out to shop. ‚ÄúWe had no idea that shopping malls would be closed on weekends from now. Since we are working professionals, we get time only on weekends to go out. We were planning to go to South Point Mall when the guard at Ambience said all shopping centres were closed,‚Äù said Lalrindiki, a private firm employee.

At Galleria, restaurants were closed but outlets involved with the sale of essential goods weren‚Äôt. ‚ÄúBefore we came to Galleria, we had gone to Qutub Enclave market. Only the small cafes and bakeries were open there. Groceries and meat shops were open but outlets selling cosmetics and garments were shut. If this goes on, I think we will have to resort to ordering online again,‚Äù said Anupreksha, a resident of DLF Phase 1.

The decision to enforce a lockdown in the weekend dealt a huge blow to businessmen too. Even in times of the pandemic, footfall sees a significant rise in malls and shopping centres of the city during the weekends.

Shop owners in Sadar Bazar said the decision appeared to be taken in haste. Many of the traders there had started opening their stores when a police patrolling team announced the government order.

‚ÄúThe government hardly thinks about small traders like us. We had anyway been suffering losses for the past three months of the lockdown . Now, when businesses had just started picking up, we were told we would be fined Rs 11,000 if we defied the government order. My total earnings do not exceed Rs 11,000 these days, how can I pay a fine?‚Äù asked Rajesh Kumar, a shop owner. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand this logic. The government has allowed the vegetable market to stay open. Many of the city‚Äôs Covid patients had contracted the infection at the mandi itself,‚Äù he added.

Traders at the Sector 14 market organised a protest against the government‚Äôs decision. ‚ÄúHow is this weekend lockdown justified? Has the government conducted any survey that says Covid spreads only on Saturdays and Sundays? Most people in the city are working professionals. They get time to shop only during the weekend,‚Äù said Sukhbir Kataria, a former minister in the Congress government.

The Gurugram administration had on Friday referred to an order of the State Disaster Management Authority to announce the weekend lockdown. Covid cases in the city have again seen a rise. As many as 648 people have tested positive in the past one week compared to 573 in the previous week.

GURUGRAM: Two days after a triple murder owing to a decade-old rivalry between two gangs in Sector 9, Gurugram police on Saturday arrested two, including a woman, in connection with the case . However, the prime accused of the murders are still at large.

The dispute over a 1,200-square-yard plot in Basai has assumed the face of a full-blown bloodied confrontation between two gangs -- Johny gang and Hariom gang -- which has led to six murders in the past two years.

According to police, Amit alias Kala , a close aide of Hariom had illegally sold a plot that belonged to Jonny and Monny and it had led to the conflict. A few months ago, Amit had allegedly killed Monny in Rewari . To avenge the death of his brother, Johny killed Amit‚Äôs associate Sanju. Amit and Jonhy were then arrested and sent to jail.

Police said that Amit‚Äôs mother Bala Devi, 57, and uncle Narender, 53, managed to release Amit on parole on August 13. Amit wanted to avenge the murder of his associate and he planned to kill Johny‚Äôs associates.

""Amit engaged his cousin Pawan Nehra and a few others and killed Johny‚Äôs associates Sashikant alias Sunny, Anmol and Sameer,"" said ACP (crime) Preet Pal Sangwan. A case was lodged with the Sector 9 police station on August 21 under section 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 148 and, 149 of IPC and sections of Arms Act. Now police have arrested Bala Devi and Narender for conspiracy. Both of them were sent to judicial custody.

362,['23/08/2020'],"Among top tourism markets, India at bottom of recovery charts","Trends, as have been observed in various post-Covid surveys, have also pointed to domestic tourism, and the relatively smaller cities gaining traction among prospective travellers. While India‚Äôs traditional Top 10 markets ‚Äî Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi-NCR, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kolkata, Mumbai and Pune ‚Äî saw a drop in hotel bookings, the RateGain data suggested that the share of tier 2 and 3 towns has increased.

NEW DELHI: Still in the grip of the coronavirus, the hospitality industry in India, a key contributor to the tourism sector, is among the slowest to recover in the world. Data mined by RateGain, a travel and hospitality technology provider that offers provides technological support to hotels, online travel agencies, airlines and car rental firms, among others, has shown that among the top 16 tourism markets in the world, India is at the third last place in hotel bookings recovery for the week that ended August 9, 2020 in comparison to the same period in 2019.The RateGain data refers to booking and pricing patterns obtained from nearly 3,000 hotels in India and 2.5 lakh hotels across the globe. Among the hotels in India to which RateGain offers technological support and whose booking patterns the company had tracked include the Hyatt group and the Taj group of hotels, Marriott, Lemon Tree and Royal Orchid.Speaking to TOI, RateGain‚Äôs chief revenue officer, Apurva Chamaria, said, ‚ÄúWe anticipate that a complete recovery in the hospitality industry will only be possible in the next three years. This is mainly because the novel coronavirus is still spreading, and in the absence of a vaccine, the traveller sentiment remains weak.

World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus sought to draw favourable comparisons with the flu pandemic of 1918 which cost the lives of as many as 50 million people.""We have a disadvantage of globalisation, closeness, connectedness, but an advantage of better technology, so we hope to finish this pandemic before less than two years,"" he said.""(By) utilising the available tools to the maximum and hoping that we can have additional tools like vaccines, I think we can finish it in a shorter time than the 1918 flu.""The WHO also recommended children over 12 years old now wear masks in the same situations as adults as the use of face coverings helps stop the virus spread.With no usable vaccine yet available, the most prominent tool governments have at their disposal is to confine their populations or enforce social distancing.South Korea announced ramped up restrictions on Saturday, after 332 new cases were reported in the past 24 hours -- the highest daily figure since early March.""We are at a very precarious stage where we could see the beginning of a nationwide second wave,"" Health Minister Park Neung-hoo said at a press briefing.The expanded measures include restrictions on gatherings and activities including professional sports, which will be played behind closed doors again, while beaches nationwide will close.Italy -- once the European epicentre of the virus -- said Saturday it had registered more than 1,000 new infections in the past 24 hours, the highest level since the end of a punishing lockdown in May.The story is similar across Spain, Germany and France.The Rome region also said it had recorded a record number of cases in the past 24 hours, a rise health officials blamed on people returning from holiday.Most of those infected are young people who are not showing symptoms, the Italian capital's health official Alessio D'Amato said, warning them to stay at home.""Don't feel invincible,"" he urged them.In Germany, a university launched a series of pop concerts under coronavirus conditions, hoping the mass experiment with 2,000 people can determine whether large events can safely resume.Elsewhere, Lebanon launched two weeks of measures on Friday including nighttime curfews, as the country is still dealing with the fallout from a huge explosion in Beirut that killed scores of people.""What now? On top of this disaster, a coronavirus catastrophe?"" said 55-year-old Roxane Moukarzel Officials fear Lebanon's fragile health system would struggle to cope with a further spike in COVID-19 cases, especially after some hospitals near the port were damaged in the explosion.The Americas have borne the brunt of the virus in health terms, accounting for more than half of the world's fatalities.""We lead the world in deaths,"" Joe Biden said Thursday while accepting the nomination to be the Democratic party's candidate in the US presidential election.

364,['23/08/2020'],Are we no longer afraid of Covid? Answer lies in our cultural habits,"(The author is COO & Chief Strategy Officer, McCann World Group)

By: Jitender DabasBy any measurement, we are now right in the middle of the pandemic. The number of Indians who have been tested and confirmed with the virus is approximately 25 lakhs but the actual number, as per many experts, is higher. This month, members of the country‚Äôs cabinet have tested positive. But, what‚Äôs baffling is the response of people all around, in our neighbourhoods and on the streets.Remember the last week of March, when the nation came to a standstill and everybody locked themselves inside their homes? Now, with the number of cases up a thousand times, why are we letting our guard down, leaving medical professionals worried?Is it that most people are no longer afraid of Covid-19, or have they given up as the caseload has increased? Or both? Is there something unique to India in its response to this health emergency? What do the authorities need to understand to get people to be more compliant of measures that can prevent the further spread of the virus?We need to recognise how fear works as a force that directs behaviour, and why it isn‚Äôt working in the face of the biggest pandemic threat humanity has faced.Remember the dialogue from Sholay, ‚ÄòSo ja beta, varna Gabbar aa jayega‚Äô? So, how and when did caution turn into bravado?Firstly, it‚Äôs the fear of the unknown or the exotic. Research has shown that different threats push different psychological buttons. Exotic threats like Ebola or Avian Flu raise anxiety levels higher than more familiar threats. At the same time, people often under-react to familiar threats. For example, influenza sickens as much as 20 percent of the population every year, and kills thousands. On March 24, Covid-19 was a novel and unknown enemy. So, we imagined a monster in our heads and reacted accordingly. The passage of four-and-a-half months has made it familiar, affecting its risk perception. When you imagine the worst in the beginning, anything less than that is underwhelming.Secondly, the extremes have been normalised. The economic cost of the lockdown put the government on the back foot, so it started to dial down the fear among citizens to encourage resumption of economic activities. The narrative has consciously moved away from, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre in a health crisis‚Äô, to, ‚ÄòEverything is back to normal‚Äô. The figure of 50,000 fatalities has been replaced by data pointing to a 70% recovery rate. Such signaling has acted towards over-normalising the situation, leading many to believe that, ‚ÄòAll izz well‚Äô.There‚Äôs also, according to behavioural research, the effectiveness of appeals based on fear, especially one-time advice over repeated warnings. So, standing to clap on balconies or lighting diyas were easy once-only interventions compared to wearing a mask every single time for more than four months.Then there are the uniquely Indian ways of mitigating risk and fear. Fatalism and a belief in destiny among the poor, and sometimes among elders, helps negotiate fear and offer protection from their higher vulnerability. But it also creates grounds for non-compliance. ‚ÄòJo hona hai, woh to hoga hi‚Äô acts as a defence mechanism which then leads to poor behaviours. And when privileged people like the Big B and ministers get infected, they use that to support their own inaction (‚ÄòWhen they couldn‚Äôt protect themselves, how would we?‚Äô).One of the factors that has weakened the appeals of health authorities for better observance has been the uncertainty surrounding the science. The constantly changing positions of the World Health Organisation on various issues has created this ambiguity. According to Maxwell Boykoff at the University of Colorado-Boulder, USA, ‚ÄúUncertainty can be reframed as scientific incompetence.‚Äù And this uncertainty is then used by sceptics or rule-breakers to justify their behaviour.Another element is tokenism. India is a culture that places a high premium on token rituals over results and evidence. Our religious practices are full of such examples which bring us fulfillment. As a result, even when it comes to hygiene conduct ranging from hand-washing to mask-wearing, we see people doing token adherence and feeling a false sense of protection. No wonder you see masks hanging around necks, whether of ministers or of common people.So, it is not surprising that we perceive a sense of calm carelessness around us as cases of Covid-19 keep mounting every day. The authorities will have to realise that the response to this negligence needs to be not only scientific and rational but also culture-sensitive, to be more effective in driving behavioural change.",gurgaon,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77698584,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-43410,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/are-we-no-longer-afraid-of-covid-answer-lies-in-our-cultural-habits/articleshow/77698585.cms

However, residents are yet to vacate many of these buildings. An estimated 500 people are currently staying at these unsafe places, officials said.The Ghaziabad municipality is, in fact, divided into five zones ‚Äî City, Kavi Nagar, Vijay Nagar, Mohan Nagar and Vasundhara. The city zone has the maximum number of unsafe buildings at 38, followed by Mohan Nagar at 31, the survey has revealed.One such unsafe building is Alaknanda Tower in Vaishali, which was constructed in 1989 by the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA). ‚ÄúWe are living in a state of constant fear. The basement is flooded with water due to monsoon showers and plasters are peeling off almost daily,‚Äù said Amit Kumar, a resident.Close to Alaknanda Tower is Kaveri Tower, the condition of which is also dangerous. ‚ÄúThe plasters of this multi-storied building are peeling off, its basement remains waterlogged throughout the year and the foundation has become weak. Immediate intervention is needed as several lives are at stake,‚Äù said Kamlesh Sharma, a resident.Tulsi Niketan in Sahibabad has also figured in the GMC‚Äôs unsafe list, where in October 2018, five members of a family had a narrow escape when the ceiling of their third-floor flat collapsed. The society was developed by GDA three decades ago but lack of maintenance led to the dilapidated condition of the buildings there. ‚ÄúThe buildings in Tulsi Niketan are unsafe for living, but we have no option but to stay on. Authorities concerned have so far not made any serious attempts to restore them,‚Äù said Amod Singh, a resident. Authorities, on the other hand, blame residents. ‚ÄúIn the case of Alaknanda Tower, it is the responsibility of the RWA to look after its maintenance. Last year, we got the safety audit of the building done by Jamia Millia Islamia, which suggested retro-fitting of the building. But that needs to be done by the RWA only,‚Äù said an official from GDA.‚ÄúIn the case of Tulsi Niketan, we had offered to build new flats, but the proposal was rejected by residents and the RWA, and in both the cases, it would be wrong to say that we did not attempt to sort out the issues,‚Äù he added.GMC chief engineer Moinuddin said, ‚ÄúDespite serving notices, many have refused to vacate the buildings.

GURUGRAM: Residents of Sector 9A in the city have alleged that their park is being dug up for construction of a guard room , which was sanctioned for the nearby Surya Nagar area. The residents also said the decision is a gross violation of green norms.

The newly developed park in Sector 9A was handed over to the RWA by the MCG and no such request for the guard room was made by the residents.

‚ÄúMindless waste of public money in the name of development is the real cause of all that troubles Gurugram. There is a lot of racketeering in tenders below Rs 10 lakh. A thorough, transparent and time-bound investigation should be conducted immediately,‚Äù said Lalit Suraj Bhola, general secretary, RWA (Sector 9A). The residents also said that at a time when the city is losing its green cover it is crucial to ensure that the existing green cover areas remain protected.

They said that no damage should be allowed to parks and other green belts in accordance with the green norms established by the NGT. ‚ÄúTherefore, we have approached the MCG to restore the damage to the park immediately,‚Äù said Bhola.

The residents said that the tender was passed for Surya Nagar and the work is being executed in the park of a different sector. ‚ÄúNo guard has ever been sanctioned for any park in Sector 9A. So the guard room is out of question. Besides, structures already exist in the park for such a purpose. So, new construction is a waste of money,‚Äù said Col. Ram Singh, another resident.

Meanwhile, residents approached MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh who ordered an inquiry and asked the official concerned to stop the work.

The mouth-watering smell that wafted from the kitchen pulled us towards it as we stared all starry-eyed at the pot and asked our mothers what is cooking! Lifestyle is much busier nowadays, and making elaborate curries that look, smell and taste wonderful has become a dream! However, this lal masala recipe changes things forever. If you don‚Äôt have the time to spend hours making dishes that have various layers and elaborate flavours, you must have this versatile masala base in your kitchen.With this lal masala, you will be able to make dishes packed with flavours within a matter of minutes. The best part about this masala recipe is that it is made with ingredients that are already available in almost every kitchen. It is quick and easy to make, and you can whip up some fresh lal masala anytime you like. You need 11 cloves of garlic, 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar, ‚Öì cup Kashmiri lal mirch powder and 2 tsp ground cumin. Put all ingredients in a food processor or grinder and grind until everything combines nicely. Scrape the walls of the blender and continue grinding until a grainy paste is achieved. Do not add more vinegar even if it takes some time to reach the desired consistency. You can store this masala for a month in an airtight container.Now that you have your freshly made lal masala, you only need a tablespoon to spruce up any dish that you might be making. If you are making gravies or stews, simply add 1 tbsp and it will enhance the flavours of your dish.

Just a quick stir will coat the onion in the spicy red masala and give a fantastic flavour.You can also use lal masala to marinate your meats and fishes. Feel free to combine this masala with other marinades to provide it with a different flavour that suits your palate. For example, if you are making a dish with chicken or meat, you can mix lal masala with mustard or barbeque sauce.Many varieties of ginger, garlic and combined pastes are available in the market that can be used as a base for your curries and gravies. However, these masalas are often mass-produced, and you can not be sure about the quality of the ingredients used. They are also packed with wide assortment of components that includes preservatives and a high amount of sodium that is enough to impact your health negatively. The poor combination of flavours might not work for your dishes as they lose their aroma fairly quickly.

Volumes of corrections are not new to teachers , but doing it digitally by continuously staring at the screen has had its effect on them, many of whom are suffering from redness and watering of eyes, frequent headaches and migraine attacks, posture related aches, aggravation of spondylosis and lack of sleep related problems.

Principals across city schools say that they are leading a battery of stressed-out souls who are just as gallant as the Covid warrior healthworkers.

Madhumita Sarkar, who has been teaching for decades, says that eye burn is a new normal for her and most of her colleagues now as corrections stretch deep into the night. ‚ÄúIt is not enough to tick or cross answers but one has to write down why an answer is wrong, which is difficult to do digitally. So this adds to the stress,‚Äù said the teacher of English at La Martiniere for Boys. Some of her colleagues are now graduating to touch-screen laptops that allow one to use digital pens for corrections.

‚ÄúBut not everybody has the right kind of gadget and many are struggling with corrections on small screens of their mobiles and are having to write comments against each child‚Äôs work using their fingertips. So, many have developed eye problems already,‚Äù said Souvic Jati, academic co-ordinator of Heritage School.

Take the cases of Dhritiman Mitra or Sharmishtha Palit, both teachers of Asian International School, who have developed serious eye problems, said principal of the school, Vijaylakshmi Kumar. ‚ÄúMost are choosing late night slot for corrections because they are occupied with school work most of the day,‚Äù she added.

Similar stories poured in from the six Loreto schools and Don Bosco Park Circus. ‚ÄúI am asking teachers to go slow, do periodic eye exercises, stretching etc,‚Äù said Father Bikash Mondal, principal of Don Bosco Park Circus. Kaveri Dutt, co-ordinator of Loreto schools in the city, said: ‚ÄúEvery teacher tries her best to hide their strain behind that smiling face during the online classes,‚Äù Dutt said.

‚ÄúI am advising patients to use anti-glare films on their computer screens and spectacles whether they have power or not. Use of artificial tears also help,‚Äù said Kajol Ghosh, a senior eye surgeon.

Till now, disasters like earthquakes, and floods were on the list and city‚Äôs infrastructure planning was chalked out keeping in mind exigencies arising out of them.

‚ÄúWe recently concluded a virtual meeting with experts from the Institute of Town Planners, in which emphasis was laid on planning the city in a manner that its infrastructure proves sufficient to handle crisis arising out of any pandemic like the one which is unfolding now, ‚Äù said SC Gaud, the chief coordinator of the NCR planning cell.

‚ÄúAlthough the plan is still at a nascent stage and the idea will soon be shared with the state government. If we get the government‚Äôs approval, the change will be incorporated in Ghaziabad Master Plan, 2031. The process has started for the plan, ‚Äù he said adding that so far only floods, earthquake and other natural disasters were taken into account while laying out plans for the city.

Gaud said, ‚ÄúBefore Covid-19 hit the world, there was no reference to terms like quarantine centre and isolation ward. But today, we see how important they are. Due to the lack of any such facility, we are being forced to convert hotels and other public places into make-shift quarantine centres and isolation wards. But we now plan to allocate space for such facilities.‚Äù

The officials said that not only the pandemic but even the lockdown had caught the city unaware. As thousands of migrant labourers lost their jobs, there was hardly any place that could give them shelter. ‚ÄúThis aspect was also discussed and there were suggestions that we could augment infrastructure to accommodate such a large influx of migrant labourers when needed,‚Äù Gaud added.

Open spaces near populated areas should also be planned, along with hospitals that should be at every 1.5km distance, officials added.

377,['23/08/2020'],Rapid urban growth in Delhi hits recharge zones,"A third of the urban land developed in the capital between 2000 and 2015 falls in high recharge potential zone

NEW DELHI: Around a third of urban land developed in Delhi between 2000 and 2015 fell in high recharge potential zones, thereby rendering the soil there impermeable to water and considerably reducing the groundwater recharge potential. The change in built-up covered area calculated in an on-going research project by World Resources Institute (WRI) India is an increase of 745 square kilometres within a 50-kilometre radius from the centre of the city, of which 33% are sited in high recharge zones .

The study defined high recharge zones as catchment areas of stormwater drains or parts of drainage channels, as well as low-lying vegetation areas. If 'medium' recharge zones are considered, around 90% of the development took place in the two crucial zones within 20km of the city centre, and 92% within 20-50km from the city centre.

""The development in high recharge zones, which is nearly one-third of the total, has reduced the amount of water seeping underground and that is why you are seeing more instances of flooding after rain, especially during the monsoon,"" said Samrat Basak, director (Urban Water), WRI India, and one of the researchers involved in the study.

Of the 10 most populous cities assessed in the study - Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune and Surat - the Karnataka capital fared the worst, recording nearly 75% of its development in high and very high recharge potential zones.

""Spaces like lakes, wetlands and forests function as natural infrastructure to absorb storm water, and reduce runoff volume and speed, thus reducing flood risk. Destruction and encroachment of these spaces deteriorate the natural flood defence of cities,"" said the study, which includes WRI researchers Sahana Goswami, Aakash Malik and Raj Bhagat.

Overall, Delhi added 745 sq km of built-up area in the 15 years being reviewed. Of this, 590 sq km were in a 20-50 km radius from the city centre, representing an increase of 116% since 2000. In comparison, there was only a 22% increase within a 0-20km radius from the city centre.

Bhagat, who also carried out a geospatial analysis of the capital using satellite data, said concretisation robbed several stretches in Delhi of any presence of even a single tree because of the rise of unauthorised colonies and rapid development. A journey between New Seelampur and Shiv Vihar in east Delhi detected two trees along the 11km distance, the geospatial analysis found.

""As more areas gets concretised, the groundwater recharge potential gets reduced. So even with development, it is important to ensure there are trees and green cover,"" said Bhagat. ""There needs to be a way for rainwater to run off to and for natural vegetation and trees not to be impeded by concretisation.""

I went out and saw that it was actually a portion of the flyover that had collapsed,‚Äù said Sunil Pachar, a resident of Vipul Greens.The span that came down had recently been attached to main viaduct of the flyover just opposite the compound of Sispal Vihar. DCP (HQ) Nitika Gahlaut, who was among the first to reach the spot after the span collapsed at 10.15pm, said police had immediately cordoned off the area while work to clear the debris began. ‚ÄúThe flyover is being constructed in the middle of the road, so it did not affect traffic movement on either side,‚Äù said Gahlaut. State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and civil defence teams were deployed at the spot.The collapse comes after severe waterlogging was reported across the city earlier this week after a heavy downpour on Wednesday, leading to roads caving in at some spots and three buildings in various parts of the city tilting. An assessment of the cause of the flyover span‚Äôs collapse was not available at the time of writing the report.An eyewitness said the two workers injured were engaged in welding work on the adjacent pier and fell into the broken portion. No details were available on the nature of their injuries. Fortunately, there was no one under the viaduct in the affected area.Sachin Srivas was returning home after completing his shift at a medical store when the span came down right before his eyes. ‚ÄúI was near the Sispal Vihar gates when the flyover collapsed. It made a huge bang and kicked up a dense cloud of dust. It took several minutes for the dust cloud to settle and visibility to return,‚Äù said Srivas.Birish Mishra, a guard on duty at a nearby society, also saw the span crashing. ‚ÄúI was standing across the road when it happened. It collapsed in a fraction of a second. No one had any time to react,‚Äù said Mishra, adding there was little traffic on the road at the time.An official of Oriental Structural Engineers Pvt Ltd, the company in charge of construction, said the span had been attached to pillar numbers 11 and 12 and was cast around 15 days ago. The midsection, where the span fell, was barricaded from both the sides for construction work, the official added. ‚ÄúWe received a message around 10.20 pm about the collapse. Thankfully, no lives were lost. Our engineers have been called to the spot to assess the structural damage,‚Äù said the official.Sources said since the span was recently cast, it needed some time to gain strength and the heavy downpour might have been one of the causes of the damage. The project official said a thorough scientific investigation would ascertain the cause of the collapse. ‚ÄúIt is only after the investigation that we can come to a conclusion,‚Äù the official added.Being built at an overall cost of around Rs 1,300 crore, the elevated road is one of the biggest infrastructure projects currently under way in the city. Once built, it will reduce the Gurugram-Alwar drive to under two hours. The elevated portion of the project connects Rajiv Chowk with Badshapur area and is meant to decongest Sohna Road while providing better connectivity to the new sectors.",gurgaon,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77700112,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-56792,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/sohna-road-flyover-span-splits-and-crashes-people-in-nearby-societies-feel-tremors/articleshow/77698715.cms

Landowners will now get compensation at Rs 2,838 per sqm, instead of Rs 2,680 per sqm fixed earlier, officials said.The additional Rs 158 per sqm will have to be paid since it has been 360 days from the time the state government had notified the acquisition of 48.1 hectares for rehabilitating the families displaced by the Jewar airport project.Under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 12% annual interest needs to be paid to the families on the compensation amount from the time notification is issued.Among all the places where land has been acquired for the construction of Jewar airport, Jewar Bangar has secured the highest rate of compensation so far. Families from the six villages, which came directly under the project, were awarded compensation at the rate of Rs 2,300 for a sqm last year.Additional district magistrate (land acquisition), Balram Singh said that so far, 58 people in Jewar Bangar have applied for compensation in lieu of their land. ‚ÄúThe rate awarded in Jewar Bangar is higher since its circle rate was also higher than the other villages. Jewar Bangar is close to the urbanised part of Jewar tehsil. It is also closer to the state highways and major roads.‚Äù‚ÄúThe prevailing circle rate in Jewar Bangar was Rs 1,340 per sqm. Two times the circle rate is offered under the act. The circle rate of the other villages was close to Rs 900 for a sqmt,‚Äù he added.Meanwhile, Jewar tehsildar Durgesh Singh said that Rs 1,800 per sqm was initially awarded to people from the six villages.‚ÄúThe state government announced an additional Rs 500 for them and hence, they got Rs 2,300,‚Äù he said.Jewar Bangar would be developed into a town to rehabilitate 3,627 families that will be displaced by the Jewar airport project.",noida,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77699944,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-268612,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/more-compensation-for-jewar-villagers/articleshow/77698355.cms

The government's mishaps in handling the coronavirus crisis after relative success in its early stages has also fueled the demonstrations.Saturday's protest comes ahead of Tuesday's deadline in which the coalition government must agree on a budget plan or trigger new elections that would be the fourth in just over a year.Ignoring police suggestions for alternative routes, the protesters marched from several parts of Jerusalem through key roads trying to reach Netanyahu's residence on Balfour Street.Outside the residence, they hoisted giant balloons depicting smeared heads of Netanyahu and his rival-turned-coalition partner Benny Gantz of the centrist Blue and White party , waved Israeli flags and the black flag of one of the grassroot protest movements.A sign read ‚ÄúBalfour is in our hands,‚Äù referring to the residence address. Other signs called on Netanyahu to quit and a placard described him as ‚ÄúCrime Minister.‚Äù Last week, Netanyahu announced a US-brokered deal to normalize ties with the United Arab Emirates , making it the third Arab country to establish full relations with Israel. The historic breakthrough has not helped calm the demonstrations against him.Netanyahu has rejected calls to step down while he is on trial and claimed the protests are the work of leftists and the media.Israel appeared to contain the pandemic in its first phase last spring, but the quick reopening of the economy led to a spike in cases. Over 100,000 Israelis have tested positive for the virus.

384,['23/08/2020'],TikTok says to sue over Trump crackdown,"NEW YORK: Video app TikTok said Saturday it will challenge in court a Trump administration crackdown on the popular Chinese-owned service, which Washington accuses of being a national security threat.

As tensions soar between the world's two biggest economies, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on August 6 giving Americans 45 days to stop doing business with TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance -- effectively setting a deadline for a potential pressured sale of the viral video sensation to a US company.

""Even though we strongly disagree with the Administration's concerns, for nearly a year we have sought to engage in good faith to provide a constructive solution. What we encountered instead was a lack of due process as the Administration paid no attention to facts and tried to insert itself into negotiations between private businesses,"" TikTok said in a statement.

""To ensure that the rule of law is not discarded and that our company and users are treated fairly, we have no choice but to challenge the Executive Order through the judicial system,"" it said, adding it expects to file its suit next week.

TikTok's kaleidoscopic feeds of short video clips feature everything from hair-dye tutorials to dance routines and jokes about daily life. It has been downloaded 175 million times in the US and more than a billion times around the world.

Trump claims TikTok could be used by China to track the locations of federal employees, build dossiers on people for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.

The company has said it has never provided any US user data to the Chinese government, and Beijing has blasted Trump's crackdown as political.

The US measures come ahead of November 3 elections in which Trump, who is behind his rival Joe Biden in the polls, is campaigning hard on an increasingly strident anti-Beijing message.

Trump has increasingly taken a confrontational stance on China, challenging it on trade, military and economic fronts.

Shortly after Trump announced his moves against TikTok in early August, the United States slapped sanctions on Hong Kong's leader over the Chinese security clampdown after last year's pro-democracy demonstrations.

Microsoft and Oracle are possible suitors for TikTok's US operations.

Reports have said Oracle -- whose chairman Larry Ellison has raised millions in campaign funds for Trump -- was weighing a bid for TikTok's operations in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

The Trump administration has also given ByteDance a 90-day deadline to divest in TikTok before the app is banned in the United States.

The measures move away from the long-promoted American ideal of a global, open internet and could invite other countries to follow suit, analysts told AFP previously.

""It's really an attempt to fragment the internet and the global information society along US and Chinese lines, and shut China out of the information economy,"" Milton Mueller, a Georgia Tech professor and founder of the Internet Governance Project said previously.

We would have liked to have our supporters there but I know they are supporting us where they are. But this is still the Champions League,"" said Mbappe on Saturday during a virtual press conference.The competition was suspended for five months before finally resuming earlier in August, with two-legged ties done away with in the quarter-finals and semi-finals.""You still feel all the tension. Everyone wants to win it, especially with this unusual format. Everyone will remember this for a long time because of the tragic events surrounding it,"" Mbappe added.While the atmosphere in the ground will be surreal for the few hundred allowed to attend, the match promises to be fascinating, pitting together two teams whose domestic dominance is almost total and who were both comfortable winners in the semi-finals.PSG sealed their place in their first Champions League final by beating RB Leipzig 3-0.They are the first French representative to get this far since Monaco in 2004 and can become just the second team from Ligue 1 to win European club football's biggest prize, after Marseille in 1993.""This is exactly why I came here. I always said that I wanted to go down in my country's history. (This) is another chance to do that,"" said Mbappe.If PSG represent the nouveau riche, Bayern are one of the continent's traditional giants. This is their 11th final.The last of their five victories came in 2013. Four starters from that 2-1 final win over Borussia Dortmund at Wembley -- goalkeeper Manuel Neuer , Jerome Boateng, David Alaba and Thomas Mueller -- could play here, although Boateng is a doubt with a hamstring injury.When, in 1974, Bayern won their first European Cup, a young PSG outfit were only just winning promotion to France's top flight.Leaving aside their storied past, Bayern appear the most formidable team in Europe just now.Their 3-0 semi-final win over Lyon was their 20th consecutive victory. They are unbeaten in 29 matches since December last year under coach Hansi Flick.They have already pocketed a German league and cup double, with the Bundesliga title their eighth in a row.They have won all 10 matches in the Champions League this season, scoring 42 goals, including a 7-2 win at Tottenham Hotspur and the 8-2 quarter-final demolition of Barcelona.Lewandowski has 55 goals this season. But he is more than ably supported.Bayern take the risk of playing with a dangerously high defensive line. Yet it remains to be seen if they can afford to take that risk against PSG's attack of Neymar, Mbappe and Angel Di Maria.""We've always played with a high line and ultimately we've got results doing that so we won't change too much,"" Flick insisted.The French champions, under German coach Thomas Tuchel, have themselves lost once since November 1, last year, and they overturned that 2-1 reverse in Dortmund in the last 16 by winning the return leg.""It is a small advantage for Bayern that they are used as a club to playing these games. I accept that, but it is not a decisive advantage,"" said Tuchel.Neymar is in fine form and Mbappe has recovered from an ankle injury, while Tuchel was optimistic playmaker Marco Verratti would start after a calf problem.However, there remains a doubt over goalkeeper Keylor Navas , three times a Champions League winner with Real Madrid, after he missed the semi-final.",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77699473,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-353916,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/football/champions-league/top-stories/psg-eye-first-champions-league-triumph-but-bayern-stand-in-their-way-in-final/articleshow/77699484.cms

392,['23/08/2020'],Pune: NCL‚Äôs big leap in fight against MDR-malaria,"Photo for representative purpose only

PUNE: As the world races to find a suitable drug to combat Covid-19, Pune-based CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory (CSIRNCL) researchers have claimed a potential breakthrough in anti-malarial medicine research by inventing a robust drug candidate to combat multidrug-resistant (MDR) ‚Äò Plasmodium falciparum‚Äô strains, the parasites that cause malaria.

The new drug candidate was recently granted a world patent, CSIR-NCL researchers . The researchers involved in the study said the new compounds had shown better efficacy than the presently used anti-malarial drugs, such as chloroquine and artemisinin, against the malaria-causing parasite.

The NCL researchers, in collaboration with the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnolog, New Delhi, developed the new drug candidate by combining artemisinin with other molecules.

NCL‚Äôs big leap in fight against MDR-malaria

Lead researcher Asish Bhattacharya from the Organic Chemistry Division of CSIR-NCL, Pune, told TOI, ‚ÄúThe new compound effectively inhibits the survival of the ring-stage parasite and shows its complete clearance by cutting its food source and killing it by inhibiting falcipain-2, which is an enzyme that helps the parasite to degrade the infected human‚Äôs haemoglobin to make its own food. The discovery will contribute significantly towards the global effort to eradicate malaria. These lead compounds can be developed as effective antimalarials to prevent the spread of resistance to currently available anti-malarials.‚Äù

Bhattacharya said, ‚ÄúAfter artemisinin, no new anti-malarial drug has come into the market or is undergoing clinical trials at present worldwide. The fear is that since the parasite is very clever and can mutate in the course of years, it can develop resistance against this drug as well. We designed and synthesized a hybrid molecule of artemisinin with another molecule, which kills the parasite by cutting its food source. In this scenario, since the new drug candidate cuts off the parasite‚Äôs food source by stopping haemoglobin degradation, it also effectively undertakes complete parasite clearance. Due to its novel mode of action, it can prevent the spread of resistance,‚Äù he said.

Bhattacharya said the new candidate can be used as an effective drug to prevent resistance to current anti-malarials.

NEW YORK: Britain's Andy Murray made a triumphant ATP comeback Saturday, defeating Frances Tiafoe 7-6 (8/6), 3-6, 6-1 in his first match of 2020 at the Western and Southern Open .

The 33-year-old Scotsman advanced in hot and humid conditions to a second-round date with German fifth seed Alexander Zverev at the COVID-19 quarantine bubble that will also be used for the US Open , which starts on August 31.

Murray won the 2012 US Open as well as the 2013 and 2016 Wimbledon titles plus the 2012 and 2016 Olympic gold medals.

Former world number one Murray, now ranked 129th, suffered a pelvic injury at Davis Cup last November and that, combined with the pandemic shutdown, kept him out of competition until he faced 22-year-old Tiafoe in a meeting of wildcard entrants.

Murray broke Tiafoe for a 2-0 lead in the third set when the American missed a volley, broke again to 5-1 with a backhand return winner and held at love to finish matters after two hours and 28 minutes.

Murray was the 2008 and 2011 winner in this Grand Slam tuneup event, usually staged in Cincinnati but moved to New York due to the COVID-19 pandemic that wiped out much of the season, including Wimbledon.

Tiafoe, ranked 81st, forced the only break point of the first set in the 11th game with a lob winner but Murray dismissed it with a service winner up the middle and held to 6-5 on a second-serve ace.

In the tie-breaker, Tiafoe jumped ahead 5-2 before Murray roared back, saving a set point to reach 6-6 when Tiafoe sent a backhand wide and taking the set two points later on a passing forehand winner.

Tiafoe, whose only ATP title came at the 2018 Delray Beach Open, saved a break point with an ace in the fifth game of the second set and took the first break of the match for a 5-3 lead on a backhand drop volley winner before holding to force a third set.

The match was played on the National Tennis Center Grandstand court, the event's feature court with no matches until the US Open scheduled at Arthur Ashe Stadium or Louis Armstrong Stadium.

On the women's side, Greek 13th seed Maria Sakkari defeated US teen Coco Gauff 6-1, 6-3 in 64 minutes. Sakkari could face 23-time Grand Slam winner Serena Williams in the third round.

Russia's Ekaterina Alexandrova ousted Kazak ninth seed Elena Rybakina 7-5, 7-6 (8/6).

Among those set to play later were seven-time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams and 2014 US Open winner Marin Cilic of Croatia.

395,['23/08/2020'],California seeks help as wildfires threaten communities,"This satellite image released by Maxar Technologies shows a large area covered in thick smoke from the CZU Lig... Read More

SACRAMENTO, Calif.: Nearly two dozen massive wildfires continued to ravage parts of California on Saturday, fueled by high temperatures and ongoing lightning strikes, including 100 that hit on Friday, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) said.

The fires have killed six people and incinerated nearly 700 buildings since beginning after an earlier lightning storm last week. Together, the blazes have burned nearly a million acres, the agency said Saturday.

Wildfire is threatening parts of the San Francisco Bay Area , the forested region near the University of California at Santa Cruz and a wide swath of the area between San Francisco and the state capital of Sacramento.

Nearly 14,000 firefighters have been deployed to the blazes, but containment of the largest ones remains low and the state has requested additional support from other states and local jurisdictions in California, CalFire said Saturday.

""They're scrambling for bodies"" to help fight the fires, said Jay Tracy, a fire marshal with the city of Fresno who was deployed as a spokesman for the LNU fire complex, which had burned 314,000 acres in five counties, including some of the state's storied wine country and communities between San Francisco and Sacramento.

Firefighters have improved containment of the southern edge of that fire, but winds are expected to push it northwest toward the wine country towns of Healdsburg and Guernville, he said.

Local agencies like his are limited in how many reinforcements they can send to help state firefighters because many are still needed at home, while the sheer volume of fires burning in the state have stretched resources, Tracy said.

Additional lightning storms are expected later this weekend, and the danger of new or growing wildfire is extreme, CalFire spokesman Daniel Berlant said.

The fires increased modestly in size on Saturday after more than doubling on Friday, becoming some of the largest in state history and threatening small towns in the path of the flames. In addition to the fatalities, 43 firefighters and civilians have been hurt.

Including smaller blazes, crews are fighting a total of 560 wildfires across the state, California Governor Gavin Newsom said Friday. Evacuations have been ordered in numerous regions. About 175,000 people were told to leave their homes, although many in the community around Vacaville between Sacramento and San Francisco have been allowed to return.

In Santa Cruz, a city of around 65,000 people on California's central coast, residents were told to prepare ""go bags"" as bulldozers cut fire lines and flames came within a mile of the University of California Santa Cruz campus.

He looked like someone who came out there just to destroy whatever comes in front of him and he pretty much did that,"" Holding said on his youtube channel.Dhoni sported many different hairstyles in his career but it was his long mane of the early days that became a the talk of the town.Hailing his big-hitting prowess, Holding said, ""Throughout his career he hit 229 sixes (in ODIs). When you think of those numbers you must be thinking he must have played for 40 years to have hit so many sixes and fours. But that is the nature of the man.""As he grew some grey around his temple area then he had to tone it down a bit and he was lot more controlled with his batting. Anyone watching MS Dhoni in the middle would know he was always in control, unflappable, never ever he looked out of control,"" he added.The stumper-batsman, who led India to victory in the T20 World Cup, the ODI World Cup and the Champions Trophy, is widely considered one of the greatest captains in international cricket and earned respect for his foresight on the cricket field.""What a captain he was, how successful he was...When he was captaining, you never saw him get excited,"" said Holding, a member of the famous pace quartet of the West Indies in the 1970s.""If things seemed to be slipping, he would call his players, have a chat calmly and then they would go back to wherever they were and things would automatically change, that was the kind of influence he had.""In 90 Tests, Dhoni scored 4,876 runs with 256 catches and 38 stumpings, while amassing 10,773 runs with 321 catches and 123 stumpings in 350 ODIs.In T20Is, he aggregated 1617 runs with 57 catches and 34 stumpings. He scored six centuries in Tests and 10 in ODIs.Holding said it is ""commendable"" that Dhoni could score nearly 5000 Test runs and also do justice to his keeping job throughout his career.""What a career this man had, a fantastic one.

403,['23/08/2020'],'Super-fit' Australia ready to hit ground running in England,"David Warner and Steve Smith. (Image credit: Daniel Kalisz/Getty Images)

SYDNEY: Justin Langer said his Australia squad are super-fit and ready to hit the ground running ahead of departing Sunday for a white-ball tour of England, their first cricket since March.

The 21-man squad gathered in Perth before taking a direct flight after which they will face several days of isolation in Derby due to coronavirus restrictions.

Training will be permitted during their lockdown and they will play four inter-squad warm-up games to get match-ready after nearly six months of inaction since the pandemic brought sport to a halt.

They will head to a bio-secure hub in Southampton for the first of three Twenty20s on September 4 against an England side who have been back in action since early July.

Three one-day internationals against the 50-over world champions follow in Manchester.

Australia are taking a larger-than-normal squad, partly because they will not be able to call up anyone into the touring party under the bio-security protocols, but also to ensure they have enough players to field two teams in warm-up games.

""The reason we're taking 21 is so we can play some good practice games over there,"" said Langer.

""The guys have done plenty of technical work, they're all super-fit so when we arrive in England, we get straight into match practice.

""That's what we've asked the boys to be ready for, that they can start playing games and, hopefully, because we've got 21 very good players coming with us, we can have some really high intensity practice games.""

Skipper Aaron Finch , who will open alongside David Warner, with Steve Smith batting at three followed by Marnus Labuschagne, said close attention will be paid to mental health inside the bio-secure bubble, with a sports psychologist travelling with the team.

""That's going to be something that's going to be a real issue, it's going to be something to monitor heavily,"" he said, with players not allowed out even to go for a meal.

Finch skippers a squad that includes three uncapped players in Daniel Sams, Riley Meredith and Josh Philippe, with an eye on the T20 World Cup next year in India then on home soil in 2022, ahead of the 50-over showpiece a year later.

Langer said it would be an invaluable experience, even if none of them get a game against England.

""We'll still be picking our best eleven, that's how it's always worked well in the Australian team,"" he said.

""And for some of the younger guys, if they force their way in through performance in the practice games, that would be great.

""Otherwise it will just be nice to have them around and give them a feel of what it's like to be inducted into the Australian cricket team.""

Australia were crushed 5-0 in a 50-over series on their white-ball tour in 2018, when Langer endured a torrid first trip in charge after taking over from Darren Lehmann in the wake of the Smith and Warner ball-tampering scandal.

Langer admitted it was not an easy time.

""I didn't know any of the players, the players didn't know me. We'd come through a great crisis which had rattled everyone,"" Langer said of the tour.

""We took on the best one-day team in the world at the time so it was a bit like David and Goliath and it was hard, it was really hard.

""But we've got two world-class players back in Steven (Smith) and David Warner, we've got our fast bowlers back. We've come a long way, haven't we?""

Australia squad:

Aaron Finch (capt), Sean Abbott, Ashton Agar, Alex Carey, Pat Cummins (vice-capt), Josh Hazlewood, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Riley Meredith, Josh Philippe, Daniel Sams, Kane Richardson, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Marcus Stoinis, Andrew Tye, Matthew Wade, David Warner, Adam Zampa

404,['23/08/2020'],"Trump's sister calls him 'cruel', 'liar' on secret recordings: Report","WASHINGTON: Donald Trump 's sister described the US president as cruel and a liar whose lack of principles meant he could not be trusted, according to a secretly-made recordings published Saturday.

It was the latest unflattering insider account to target the president, only instead of a jilted aide or business associate, it was from one of his closest relatives.

Maryanne Trump Barry slammed her brother over his immigration policy that saw children separated from their parents at the border and sent to detention centers.

""All he wants to do is appeal to his base,"" she said in recordings obtained by the Washington Post. ""He has no principles. None.""

""His goddamned tweet and lying, oh my God.""

The recordings were secretly made by the president's niece Mary Trump , who published last month a bombshell memoir of the ""toxic family"" that produced him.

The president's younger brother Robert, who died last week, went to court to try to block its publication, arguing that Mary was violating a non-disclosure agreement signed in 2001 after the settlement of her grandfather's estate, but to no avail.

Some 950,000 copies were sold the day of the memoir's release, with the White House branding the memoir as a ""book of falsehoods"".

At one point in the recordings, Barry said to her niece: ""It's the phoniness of it all. It's the phoniness and this cruelty. Donald is cruel.""

The recordings also shed light on the source of an embarrassing claim in the memoir that the president paid someone to take a college entrance exam for him.

""He got into University of Pennsylvania because he had somebody take the exams,"" Barry said, adding she even remembered the man's name.

The president or the White House did not immediately comment on the recordings.

405,['23/08/2020'],2 tropical storms heading for double blow to US Gulf Coast,"Heavy waves are seen after Tropical Storm Laura passed in Juana Diaz, Puerto Rico on August 22, 2020

SAN JUAN: Two tropical storms advanced across the Caribbean on Saturday night as potentially historic threats to the U.S. Gulf Coast, one dumping rain on Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands while the other was pushing through the gap between Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and Cuba.

Tropical Storms Laura and Marco were both projected to approach Louisiana at or close to hurricane force just two days apart next week.

A hurricane watch was issued for the New Orleans metro area, which was pummeled by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005.

Two hurricanes have never appeared in the Gulf of Mexico at the same time, according to records going back to at least 1900, said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. The last time two tropical storms were in the Gulf together was in 1959, he said.

The last time two storms made landfall in the United States within 24 hours of each other was in 1933, Klotzbach said.

The projected tracks from the U.S. National Hurricane Center on Saturday afternoon pointed to both storms being together in the Gulf on Monday, with Marco hitting Louisiana and Laura making landfall in the same general area Wednesday. But large uncertainties remain for that time span, and forecasts have varied greatly so far for the two storms.

‚ÄúWe are in unprecedented times,‚Äù Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said at a news conference Saturday as he declared a state of emergency. ‚ÄúWe are dealing with not only two potential storms in the next few hours, we are also dealing with COVID-19.‚Äù He urged residents to prepare for the storms and, if possible, find places to evacuate that are not public shelters.

A hurricane watch was issued for Intracoastal City, Louisiana, eastward to the Mississippi-Alabama border.

People in Louisiana headed to stores to stock up on food, water and other supplies. Raymond Monday of Gretna, though, had only a generator on his cart at Sam's Club. ‚ÄúWe've got a freezer full of food‚Äù at home, along with large containers of water, he said.

Laura flung rain across Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands on Saturday and was expected to drench the Dominican Republic, Haiti and parts of Cuba through Sunday on its westward course.

Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda V√°zquez declared a state of emergency and warned that flooding could be worse than what Tropical Storm Isaias unleashed three weeks ago because the ground is now saturated. The storm knocked down trees in the island's southern region, and left more than 200,000 clients without power and more than 10,000 without water across the U.S. territory.

‚ÄúNo one should be out on the streets,‚Äù she said.

Officials said they were most concerned about the thousands of people in Puerto Rico who still have been living under blue tarps since 2017's Hurricane Maria and the hundreds of families living along the island's southern coast in homes damaged by a string of strong earthquakes this year.

The storm was centered about 85 miles (135) kilometers east-southeast of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, on Saturday night, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph). It was moving west at 18 mph (30 kph).

As the storm approached Hispaniola, crews in the Dominican Republic began evacuating dozens of families in flood-prone areas.

Marco, meanwhile, was strengthening while centered about 75 miles (120 kilometers) west-northwest of Cuba's western tip, headed to the north-northwest at 13 mph (20 kph). It had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 kph) and was expected to become a hurricane later Saturday.

Carlos Joaqu√≠n Gonz√°lez, governor of Mexico's Quintana Roo state, celebrated that Marco's changed trajectory spared his state's beaches, including those in Cancun, the country's top tourist destination.

The National Hurricane Center said it expected the storms to stay far enough apart to prevent direct interaction as the region braces for the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, which is forecast to be unusually active.

Both storms were expected to bring 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 centimeters) of rain to areas they were passing over or near, threatening widespread flooding across a vast region.

‚ÄúA lot of people are going to be impacted by rainfall and storm surge in the Gulf of Mexico,‚Äù said Joel Cline, the tropical program coordinator for the National Weather Service. ‚ÄúSince you simply don't know, you really need to make precautions.‚Äù It seems fitting for such an unusual twin threat to arrive in 2020, said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy.

‚ÄúOf course, we have to have two simultaneously land-falling hurricanes,‚Äù McNoldy said. ‚ÄúIt's best not to ask what's next.‚Äù ) Forecasters said that while atmospheric conditions were favorable for Laura to grow, its passage over Puerto Rico and the mountains of Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Cuba could tear it apart or weaken it before it entered warm Gulf waters conducive to growth.

407,['23/08/2020'],Air turbulence: Flyers take detour to beat homecoming uncertainties,"Kolkata: It‚Äôs not just those stranded in Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai who are flying back via different cities to beat the ban on flights from these cities to Kolkata. Even those stranded abroad have started returning home on flights via multiple Indian cities to bypass the embargo on Vande Bharat flights that are repatriating Indians stuck in different parts of the world.

In the past month, scores of Kolkatans reached Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru or Chennai on Vande Bharat flights and then took domestic flights via other cities to reach Kolkata after spending a week in hotel quarantine. With the SOP now revised, allowing passengers who board flights with Covid-negative reports to skip quarantine, more are flying back after being held up for nearly five months. While lockdown had left them stranded for two months, those who could not avail the window when repatriation flights were operating to Kolkata before the embargo came into place from July 1 are now taking desperate measures to return home.

Kalikapur resident Tathagata Roy Chowdhury, who was stranded with his wife and kid in London, returned via Delhi after waiting in vain to catch a Vande Bharat flight. ‚ÄúWith the visa about to expire and funds running low, I had no option but to take a packed Vande Bharat flight to Delhi and stay in hotel for seven days for mandatory quarantine,‚Äù said Roy Chowdhury. With no direct flights to Kolkata from Delhi, the family took a flight to Hyderabad and then a flight to the city.

Software engineer Abhijit Mitra‚Äôs UK visa expired on July 31 before he decided to take a detour via Bengaluru to avoid legal issues. He, along with his parents, wife and child boarded the flight on August 9. ‚ÄúI had waited long for a flight to Kolkata via Delhi. But with no clarity on when that will happen, we flew back and checked into a hotel in New Town,‚Äù said Mitra, now back at his Dum Dum residence.

Engineer Rahul Dixit had initially booked a flight to Kolkata on a Gulf carrier but after it was cancelled, he flew to Delhi and then took Rajdhani Express to Howrah. ‚ÄúIt is only now that charter flights have been allowed. But fares on are high and there is no certainty till the eleventh hour on its operation,‚Äù he said.

London-based engineer and Durgapur resident Soumik Dutta will be flying back on August 31 via Amritsar. ‚ÄúI will try to undergo a Covid test three days prior to boarding the flight so that we don‚Äôt have to go for hotel quarantine,‚Äù Dutta told TOI from London.

While charter flights to Kolkata have taken off from the Gulf, long-haul charter flights from Europe or the US are yet to materialize as getting adequate passengers is difficult since the flights cannot be publicized till various clearances are in.

LISBON: Paris Saint-Germain coach Thomas Tuchel has expressed confidence that playmaker Marco Verratti will be fit enough to start in Sunday's Champions League final against Bayern Munich.

The key Italian international missed PSG 's quarter-final win over Atalanta because of a calf problem and only played seven minutes as a substitute in the 3-0 semi-final victory over RB Leipzig on Tuesday.

But Tuchel revealed that Verratti, along with fellow midfielder Idrissa Gana Gueye, had since been back in full training. However, first-choice goalkeeper Keylor Navas remains a doubt.

""Marco and Idrissa trained with us after the Leipzig game without any problem... they are both available,"" Tuchel said on Saturday, ahead of the final at Lisbon's Estadio da Luz.

Gueye played against Atalanta but was replaced in the second half of that match and played no part against Leipzig.

Leandro Paredes and Ander Herrera started alongside Marquinhos in a three-man midfield in the semi-final.

Of Verratti, Tuchel added: ""His injury was a knock. It wasn't muscular, so the risk is not big.""

""It will be difficult for him to last 120 minutes or 90 minutes in the midfield tomorrow, but as long as nothing happens to him in training yes (he can play), and then we will see in the morning if he can start.""

Tuchel added: ""For Keylor it is different. He is going to try today (Saturday) to train fully for the first time, but that is a decision we will need to take later.

""It will be yes or no, black or white. We will make a decision after training.""

Sergio Rico is standing by to replace Navas, having already done so in the semi-final. Navas won the Champions League three times as a Real Madrid player between 2016 and 2018.

NEW DELHI: The number of Covid-19 containment zones in Delhi has risen from 539 on August 1 to 591 on August 21, with officials attributing the rise to smaller areas being contained now. According to data, the number of containment zones had decreased to 496 in the national capital on August 2 and had witnessed a marginal increase to 499 on August 4.

The following days, the number declined to 481 and 466. On August 12, the number of containment zones went past 500.

In July, the number of such areas was more than 700 in Delhi, but it gradually declined in August owing to the government allowing the ""red"" zones to be denotifified 14 days after the discharge of the last confirmed case, instead of the earlier norm of 28 days.

The number of containment zones was 591 in Delhi on Friday, according to a list available on the Revenue department's website.

411,['23/08/2020'],IIT clears Chingrighata pier for Garia-Airport Metro link,"Kolkata: A major impasse has been solved for New Garia-Airport Metro as IIT-Kharagpur has cleared the pier planned on EM Bypass at Chingrighata crossing.

Last October, KMDA, custodian of Bypass, asked IIT-Kharagpur to deduce whether the elliptical pier ‚Äî 318 ‚Äî could be dropped since it would take up much space at the messy crossing.

The institute has submitted its report. It has told KMDA that pier 318 can‚Äôt be done away with at this stage. A senior KMDA official said, ‚ÄúWe hope the long-standing impasse will end now.‚Äù KMDA will be placing IIT‚Äôs report before Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), the implementing agency of the project.

RVNL has told KMDA that without pier 318, the gap between the two pillars (before and after 318) increases from 28m to 60m. The curvaceous elevated Metro viaduct should sit safely on these three pillars while turning right towards Nicco Park. RVNL said the pillar on the median at Chingrighata is crucial since the viaduct curve is too sharp (352.1m radius).

IIT is drawing up a long-term solution for the Chingrighata crossing where too many roads ‚Äî from the Sector V-end, Beliaghata and Chaulpatty ‚Äî meet. The intersection on the 29km-long EM Bypass takes much traffic load and road mishaps are common.

In June 2019, KMDA came up with a more feasible layout for the crossing. Among them were a wider road along Jal Vayu Vihar, a bridge over the canal for buses to cross over to Nicco Park, two foot-overbridges (FOBs) at Shantinagar and Chaulpatty, a wider bridge culvert and a cyclists‚Äô bay.

While widening the culvert, KMDA realized that pier 318 would occupy 4.1sqm space and cramp the already congested EM Bypass-Salt Lake Bypass crossing. With RVNL refusing to part with the pier, KMDA sought IIT‚Äôs assessment.

CHENNAI: Pol Espargaro and Red Bull KTM Factory Racing earned their first MotoGP pole positions after taking the spoils on Saturday at the BMW M Grand Prix of Styria.

It was a fierce Q2 session at the Red Bull Ring that saw Takaaki Nakagami (LCR Honda Idemitsu) claim his maiden premier class front row in P2, with Q1 graduate Johann Zarco (Esponsorama Racing) defying the odds to qualify third. However, the Frenchman will start from pitlane on Sunday. (All the action from the BMW M Grand Prix of Styria will be LIVE on Eurosport and Eurosport HD with the final race on August 23, 2020, (Sunday) from 2:15 PM IST. The main race can also be streamed LIVE on Discovery Plus application from 3:30 PM IST on Sunday.)

The opening laps in Q2 were tentative but once the riders got one lap under their belt, qualifying kicked off in stunning style at the Styrian GP. Fabio Quartararo (Petronas Yamaha SRT) was the first man to delve into the 1:23s with a 1:23.866, with Zarco slotting into second despite his recently operated on scaphoid. Joan Mir (Team Suzuki Ecstar) went onto the provisional front row before Nakagami then went P3.

A raging Red Bull then came flying over the line to snatch provisional pole position from Quartararo. Pol Espargaro took over at the top by two tenths and moved the goalposts to a 1:23.645, but he wouldn't be at the top of the tree for long. Nakagami was on a charge and the Japanese star took P1 by 0.043 as a breathless opening stint ended. The Austrian hills fell silent for a brief period as fresh Michelin rubber got slotted in, ready for five minutes of MotoGP‚Ñ¢ mayhem at the Red Bull Ring.

Jack Miller (Pramac Racing) - who didn't set a lap time in Q2 after encountering shoulder issues after his FP3 crash - jumped from P11 to P3 with a great lap, before Espargaro then shot to the top of the times by 0.022. Alex Rins (Team Suzuki Ecstar) climbed to P4 and after two sectors, his teammate Mir was on for pole position - and so was Ducati Team's Andrea Dovizioso . Mir couldn't hold his advantage in Sectors 3 and 4 as the Suzuki rider went P3, with Dovizioso slotting into P6.

Quartararo had slipped from P1 to P7 with just over a minute to go, as his compatriot Zarco went flying onto the front row. Maverick Vi√±ales (Monster Energy Yamaha MotoGP) found himself down in P10 and he was up after two sectors. However, with Pol Espargaro absolutely lightning through Sector 3, Vi√±ales lost time and had to settle for P6. Was there a further late twist in the bull's tail? Pol Espargaro and KTM were all set for celebrating their maiden premier class pole positions but Nakagami was on a flyer. The Honda man was just 0.006 down after Sector 3 but Nakagami couldn't hold on - with his lap getting cancelled for exceeding track limits anyway.

A day earlier, Dole‚Äôs pregnant wife lodged a missing person‚Äôs complaint with the police, claiming that her husband hadn‚Äôt come home since he went out with three friends on the night of August 16.

Senior inspector Vasant Kuvar said they followed a promising lead and took Jori (23) into custody from Lonavla.

The murder was the fallout of an ongoing rivalry. ‚ÄúThe deceased man and the suspects ‚Äî including two brothers ‚Äî were good friends, but had quarrelled frequently in the past few months,‚Äù Kuvar said.

Kuvar said skirmishes between Dole and the suspects were a regular sight in the area. ‚ÄúDole‚Äôs brother too had witnessed one of their quarrels,‚Äù he said.

Kuvar, however, said there was an immediate reason for the murder. ‚ÄúDole had slapped one of the suspects a couple of days before the murder. Vowing revenge, the suspects assaulted Dole with a blunt and heavy object and strangled him. They bundled his body in a gunny sack and buried the body in the backyard of the house in which the two brothers lived,‚Äù he said.

414,['23/08/2020'],Chess Olympiad: Russia unstoppable in Pool C,"CHENNAI: The Russian team is cruising through Pool C at the FIDE online chess Olympiad . They started the day with two clean sweeps: 6-0 against Algeria and 6-0 against Morocco.

In the 6th round they had to face a much tougher opponent, England, but nevertheless the Russian players adapted quickly to this sudden increase in the level of their rivals, and achieved a convincing victory by 5-1. Luke McShane and Jovanka Houska drew against Grischuk and Lagno, respectively, but Russia claimed the victory in the remaining four boards.

With these results, Russia reaches the last day of competition with a 2-point gap over Armenia, who seems to be the only team that is able to keep pace with them. On Saturday, the Armenians won their three matches with high scores: they beat Croatia by 4¬Ω-1¬Ω (despite Aronian's defeat against Ante Brkic), and then Algeria and Morocco by 6-0.

Romania is third, tied with England, but they are yet to play against Russia. This will happen in the 9th and last round, and it could be a decisive match in the eventuality of Armenia winning against Russia.

England, led by the seven-time British Champion Michael Adams , is having a pretty decent result so far. They won four matches, but unfortunately they went down in flames against Russia and Croatia, scoring just 1 point. The Croatians were the sensation in the first day of play, but on Day 2 they lost two matches and only managed to draw against Bulgaria.

Round 5 will also be remembered for a great display of sportsmanship by the Russian team. Morocco failed to provide the line up on time, and when that happens the team is supposed to play with their six starting players. However, Morocco's second board was not available, so Russia would have won automatically by default in that board. Default time passed, but Artemiev rejected the idea of being given the point without playing. So the arbiters managed to get him the game he was due to play (had Morocco submitted the team list in time) against the first reserve Nassim Zrikem .

415,['23/08/2020'],"In just a week, wildfires burn 1 million acres in California","SAN FRANCISCO: Weary firefighters in California raced Saturday to slow the spread of wildfires that burned nearly one million acres statewide in a week and destroyed hundreds of homes ahead an expected weather change that could bring more lightning strikes like the ones that sparked many of the blazes.

Responding to the emergency, President Donald Trump issued a major disaster declaration to provide federal assistance. Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement that the declaration will also help people in counties affected by the fires with crisis counseling, housing and other social services.

Two clusters of wildfires in the San Francisco Bay Area grew to become the second- and third-largest wildfires in recent state history by size. Light winds and cooler and more humid nighttime weather helped fire crews make progress on those fires and a third group of fires south of San Francisco ahead of the forecast of warm, dry weather, erratic wind gusts and lightning, state fire officials said.

The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning of high fire danger across the Bay Area and along the Central Coast, beginning from Sunday morning to Monday afternoon.

‚ÄúThe worst is not behind us. We are in a battle rhythm,‚Äù California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) Chief Thom Porter tweeted.

Since thousands of lightning strikes began on Aug. 15, the state reported 585 wildfires that have burned nearly a million acres, or 1,562 square miles (4,046 square kilometers), according to Cal Fire.

Many were small and remote. The bulk of damage was from three fire ‚Äúcomplexes‚Äù that were ravaging forest and rural areas in and around the San Francisco Bay Area. They have burned 1,045 square miles (2,700 square kilometers). The fires have killed five people, torched nearly 700 homes and other structures and forced tens of thousands from their houses.

‚ÄúTuesday night when I went to bed I had a beautiful home on a beautiful ranch,‚Äù said 81-year-old Hank Hanson of Vacaville. ‚ÄúBy Wednesday night, I have nothing but a bunch of ashes.‚Äù

In Santa Cruz County, the fire was threatening Boulder Creek, an old logging community of about 5,000 in the Santa Cruz Mountains on the edge of California's oldest state park -- Big Basin Redwoods. Fire officials said they expected the blaze to reach the community, but they took advantage of recent good weather to try to ‚Äúherd‚Äù flames around the town.

Earlier in the week, fire officials in charge of each of the three major wildfires said they were strapped for resources. Some firefighters were working 72-hour shifts instead of the usual 24 hours. By Friday, the approximately 13,700 firefighters on the line began to get help on the ground and with aircraft from 10 states, along with the National Guard and U.S. military.

Those fires were a top priority. But in a sign of how overburdened the state's firefighting agency is, fire officials said only 1,400 firefighters were assigned to battle the LNU Lightning Complex fire in wine country north of San Francisco, which was only 15% contained.

In comparison, about 5,000 firefighters were assigned to the Mendocino Complex fire in 2018, the largest fire in recent state history.

‚ÄúAll of our resources remain stretched to capacity that we have not seen in recent history,‚Äù said Shana Jones, the chief for Cal Fire's Sonoma-Lake-Napa unit.

‚ÄúWe are making progress, but we are not out of the woods,‚Äù she said.

Underscoring the danger the fires pose for firefighters, the Sonoma County sheriff's office released dramatic video of the helicopter rescue Friday night of two firefighters trapped on a ridge line at Point Reyes National Seashore. They were hoisted to safety as flames advanced.

‚ÄúHad it not been for that helicopter, those firefighters would certainly have perished,‚Äù Sonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick said.

Containment for the fire burning in the Santa Cruz Mountains and along the coast of San Mateo County, south of San Francisco, was at just 5%, and 115 homes and other structures had been destroyed. Firefighters established a fire break aimed at protecting the evacuated University of California , Santa Cruz campus and the surrounding area.

‚ÄúIt's not a silver bullet. But it gives us a really good stronghold to keep the fire from moving south toward those communities,‚Äù Cal Fire Battalion Chief Mark Brunton said.

416,['23/08/2020'],Delhi: North corporation wants STP water for Naini Lake,"DJB Requested After NGT Order On Revival Plan

NEW DELHI: After several attempts to revive Naini Lake , including introduction of floating gardens, North Delhi Municipal Corporation has now started correspondence with Delhi Jal Board (DJB) for supplying water through its nearest sewage treatment plant (STP).

The move has come following directions from the monitoring committee constituted by the principal bench of National Green Tribunal in February.

""It was decided that Naini Lake should be filled with treated water from the nearest STP of DJB Coronation Pillar at Mukherjee Nagar. The committee also desired that the three tubewells at the lake, which is used for refilling the waterbody, should be uninstalled,"" said a north corporation official.

He added that the civic body had written to the officials concerned for arranging a visit to the plant, assess the actual requirement of water, and the tentative cost in laying the pipeline from the STP till the lake.

""But we want to clarify everything, including how long it will take to lay the pipeline and supply water to this place. We are going through a financial crisis, so for funding , we plan to pursue the Centre for help through the Urban Development Fund scheme,"" said the official. He added that if nothing works out, they would ask DJB to revive the lake, like it earlier did for Roshanara Lake. ""We will give no objection certificate to it in this case too,"" he said.

The official claimed that the regular supply of water was must to maintain the flora and fauna of the Naini Lake, which is spread over 6 acres and requires 7.2 million litres of water per day.

DJB has, meanwhile, also laid out a revival plan through rejuvenation of dying lakes and other waterbodies. A DJB official said, ""We have visited the lake along with the monitoring committee and decided that treated water will be supplied for free. However, as far as the laying of the pipeline is concerned, it will be the responsibility of the civic body. Since the Coronation STP will take 2-3 months in commissioning, it's only then a decision on laying the main pipeline will be taken. The civic agency can take the peripheral line from tapping point easily. The distance from STP plant to the lake is hardly a kilometre.""

Last year, the corporation had planned to restart boating at the lake after its revival. It had engaged National Environmental Engineering Research Institute to clean the pond and installed floating planters, despite which no major changes were witnessed in the quality of water.

417,['23/08/2020'],Final length of Atal Tunnel adds up to 9.02km: BRO chief,"Rohtang Pass remains shut for more than six months every year

MANALI: The length of Atal Tunnel , Rohtang, the prestigious project of the Indian Army that bypasses Rohtang Pass to cut the distance short between Manali and Ladakh, will be 9.02km, said Director General, Border Roads (DGBR) Lt Gen Harpal Singh on Saturday.

The length of the tunnel was initially estimated to be 8.8km, but following the construction of tunnelshaped avalanche control structure, its final length has become 9,02m. After the civil works in the tunnel are completed by August 31, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate it in September or early October. Atal Tunnel , Rohtang, will be the longest traffic tunnel of the world at 10,000ft from the sea level.

Visiting a second time this month, the DGBR reviewed the progress of work. He is personally monitoring the work due to its strategic importance.

‚ÄúThe work in the tunnel advanced at an exceptional pace since the appointment of Lt Gen Harpal Singh as the director general of Border Roads Organisation (BRO), as he is taking personal interest in the project. He visits the site very frequently. Tunnel work persevered through the Covid-19 pandemic only due to his personal involvement. This will ensure that people of Lahaul valley get the benefit of the tunnel this winter season despite blockade of the Rohtang Pass,‚Äù said a BRO official.

The BRO is looking at this project as their biggest achievement in tunnel-building and strengthening the border roads infrastructure. This tunnel being the only such tunnel in the country that has been made above an altitude of 10,000ft and is being fitted with latest technologies and safety instruments, it has taught many lessons to the BRO engineers, who had to face many geological challenges while digging it from both sides.

While the Rohtang tunnel will reduce the distance between Manali and Leh by 46km, more tunnels on Manali-Leh axis have been proposed to make this highway all weather and further reduce travel time.

418,['23/08/2020'],Alex Carey 'disappointed' to lose Australia white-ball vice-captaincy,"Alex Carey. (Getty Images)

SYDNEY: Alex Carey has admitted he was ""disappointed"" at losing the vice-captaincy of Australia's white-ball team for their series in England, but said he understood the rationale.

The wicketkeeper-batsman had shared the duties with pace spearhead Pat Cummins since Justin Langer took over as coach in 2018.

But a decision, backed by captain Aaron Finch, was made to streamline the leadership, with Cummins anointed sole deputy for next month's three one-day internationals and three Twenty20s in England.

""You're always going to be disappointed with that but I'm also really grateful and thankful for the opportunity I've had in that role in the past 24 months,"" Carey told cricket .com.au late Saturday.

""I would love to still have the title next to my name but it's not going to change anything from my end.

""I'm still going to rock up with a big smile on my face and try really hard around the group. It's going back to the old model, which has worked in the past.""

Carey, who has played 26 ODIs and 28 Twenty20s, added: ""The decision sits really comfortably with me now.""

Finch, who captains both the ODI and Twenty20 teams, said having a single line of contact was important for him on Australia's first tour since the coronavirus pandemic brought sport to a halt in March.

""At times if you have seven or eight guys going to three or four people, sometimes it can feel a little bit clouded and you just get to a point where you have so much advice,"" he said.

""So for Pat to be able to filter that out on the field will be a huge help.""

The squad will leave from Perth for England later on Sunday.

Cricket Australia insist there are no captaincy succession plans in place for 33-year-old Finch, who recently said he wanted continue until the one-day World Cup in 2023, or Test skipper Tim Paine, who will be 36 this year.

Travis Head and Cummins are the current Test vice-captains and are widely seen as leadership candidates along with Carey, former captain Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne .

Former vice-captain David Warner, a fixture in all three formats, is banned from holding a leadership position ever again for his part in the 2018 ball-tampering scandal.

420,['23/08/2020'],"Donald Trump News: Trump ordered to pay $44,100 in Stormy Daniels legal fees","LOS ANGELES: A California court ordered President Donald Trump this week to pay $44,100 in attorney fees to porn actress Stormy Daniels to pay for her legal battle over her effort to cancel a hush money deal brokered to keep her quiet about their sexual relationship a decade ago.

The order in Superior Court in Los Angeles determined Daniels won her lawsuit against Trump over the agreement that was signed 11 days before the 2016 presidential election. As a part of that deal, the losing party would pay the lawyers fees.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the decision.

The president's personal lawyer at the time, Michael Cohen, paid $130,000 to Daniels, who filed the suit under her legal name Stephanie Clifford. After Trump's election, Daniels sued to void the agreement.

Trump and his supporters denied the president knew about the payment for several years before Trump acknowledged it on Twitter in May 2018 and said he reimbursed Cohen for the money paid to Daniels.

Daniels' suit over the non-disclosure agreement was dismissed before going to trial or a settlement because the parties were no longer quiet. Trump's lawyers said Daniels didn't win the case and therefore wasn't entitled to lawyer fees, but Judge Robert Broadbelt III disagreed in his ruling Monday, posted online by Daniels' lawyers.

Trump's lawyers also argued Daniels didn't prove the president was a part of the non-disclosure agreement which was made under the name ‚Äú David Dennison,"" but Broadbelt wrote there was a large amount of evidence showing Cohen chose Dennison as a pseudonym for Trump.

After her lawyer announced the decision, Daniels wrote on Twitter: ‚ÄúYup. Another win.‚Äù But they haven't all been wins for Daniels. She also sued Trump for defamation after the president's comments on Twitter that a man she said threatened her to stay quiet about their alleged affair in 2011 was ‚Äúnonexistent."" Trump also posted side-by-side photos of the composite sketch of the man making the threats and Daniels' husband.

The defamation lawsuit was thrown out and Daniels is appealing the decision and an order to pay Trump almost $300,000 in attorney fees.

A judge in that case ruled Trump's statements on Twitter were protected speech under the First Amendment.

Since Trump's election, Daniels has remained in the adult entertainment industry, using her new fame to promote strip club appearances and shows, including her latest venture called ‚ÄúSpooky Babes Paranormal Show‚Äù where she said she is leading a team of investigators to hunt ghosts and get answers for people here on Earth. She also still takes shots at the president on Twitter.

Meanwhile, Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance charges and lying to Congress, among other crimes, and was sentenced to three years in prison in 2018.

By Kiritsinh Zala

RAJKOT: His religion did not create an impediment when Rajkot-based Sohil Baloch decided to compose and sing a bhajan dedicated to Lord Shiva . Nor, did the acrimonious Indo-Pak relationship matter when his Pakistani friend, Wajid Ali Khan , accompanied the singer on the tabla. The melodious rendition of the duo left listeners‚Äô hearts melting in devotion.

‚ÄúThough born into a Muslim family, I have been brought up on bhajans as I lived in a Hindu area. During my childhood, I used to go to Swadhyay Parivar and sing bhajans,‚Äù says Sohil (30), who lives in Bajarangvadi area of Rajkot.

Sohil has also written and composed a bhajan, ‚ÄúMai To Jogi Banke Aya‚Äù (I have become a hermit), in which Khan has played tabla. ‚ÄúI came into contact with Wajidbhai, a resident of Lahore in Pakistan, on Facebook three months ago. I sent him the composition of the song, which he loved very much. He was so kind to me that he filled in the composition with his music and tabla and sent it back to me,‚Äù says Sohil.

‚ÄúWajidbhai is the son of Tafu Ali Khan, a legendary a tabla player who used to play tabla for famous Pakistani ghazal singer Ghulam Ali,‚Äù Sohil added.

Sohil‚Äôs father Yusuf Baloch, also a music composer known as Kamalbhai, would send Sohil to Swadhyay Parivar where Pandurang Shastri Athavale would ask Sohil to sing bhajans. Sohil‚Äôs elder sister Tasleem Baloch is the principal of Sanskar Deep High School in Jamnagar, and a ghazal singer.

‚ÄúI was inspired by my father and elder sister to take up music as a career. I serve as a music teacher with SNK High School on University Road in Rajkot,‚Äù says Sohil.

Sohil has done masters in music from Arjunlal Hirani Performing Arts College in Rajkot. So far, he has composed and released 20-odd albums consisting of bhajans and songs.

Ten years ago, Sohil had composed and sung a bhajan dedicated to Lord Ganapati along with famous folk singer Nidhi Dholakia. Five years ago, Sohil had recomposed Saint Narsinh Mehta‚Äôs bhajan ‚ÄòVaishnav Janato Tene Re Kahiye‚Äô, in which he made 21 folk singers including Kirtidan Gadhvi, Hemant Chauhan, Lalita Godadara and Osman Meer lend their voices. Two years ago during the holy month of Ramzan, Sohil had sung bhajans dedicated to Lord Swaminarayan at Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan temple in the presence of Mahant Swami.

It will be hardly a surprise if the three of them make it to the semifinals.

Brazil, Cuba, and Argentina lost in succession on Saturday against the USA. The team led by Wesley So is so dominant that they not only have won their six matches, but they have done so giving away very few points in the individual games: out of 36 games, they have won 22, drew 13, and lost just 1.

Greece also won all their three matches and they climbed to second place, three points behind the leaders, and one ahead of Peru. Taking into account that Greece has already played against the top teams, they will have relatively easier pairings for the last day, and that gives them good chances of advancing to the next stage.

Peru lost to Greece in round 4, but then they bounced back by beating Paraguay and Italy. Still, they go down from second place at the end of Day 1, to third place at the end of Day 2. They keep some chances to qualify, but at the very least they will win recognition as the best Latin-American team, since Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Cuba are all now in the bottom half of the table.

Poland lost a match against an erratic Italy, and drew with Brazil in a slightly disappointing performance.

BEIJING: Amid the threat of China endangering Taiwan's security, the country's defence ministry has released a video showing troops firing anti-aircraft, anti-tank and anti-ship missiles in defence of the island against a mock invasion from across the Taiwan Strait, South China Morning Post reported.

While releasing the video, the ministry reportedly issued a warning to China saying that the latter should not underestimate the island nation's capability to defend itself. South China Morning Post quoted the ministry as saying, ""The most egotistical country can thoughtlessly provoke a war and the most ignorant government can be caught in the flames of war.""

The ministry further said that repeated provocation by China's People's Liberation Army will no longer work. ""It would have only the effect of triggering the wrath and antipathy of Taiwan's people, and hurt peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,"" the ministry said.

On Wednesday, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen was quoted as saying, ""We have a full grasp of and are closely monitoring the overall military situation and the public can rest assured our military is able to safeguard our national security.""

Taiwan military's latest move comes days after China media revealed details of PLA's new Tianlei 500, a 500kg (1,100lb) precision-guided munitions dispenser and air-to-surface missile. South China Morning Post further reported that on Tuesday, CCTV broadcasted a report about the PLA staging live-fire exercises at both the northern and southern ends of Taiwan, and a day later released footage of a live-fire drill staged by the PLA in the East China Sea .

Further, on August 13, the PLA Eastern Theatre Command said that it had recently carried out combat exercises at the north and south ends of the Taiwan Strait.

LISBON: Paris St Germain striker Kylian Mbappe says he wants to make history for France by winning the country's first Champions League title in 27 years in Sunday's final against Bayern Munich.

PSG beat Atalanta and RB Leipzig in the ""final eight"" in Lisbon, and Mbappe is feeling relaxed about the test against Bayern and the significance for French football .

""This is exactly why I came here,"" he told reporters on Saturday. ""I have always said that I wanted to make history for my country. This is a chance. When I arrived in 2017, we experienced several disappointments. Today, we are in the final and that shows that we have not given up.

""It would be a great reward to win with a French club. It was my mission when I came. Winning (on Sunday) would be incredible, it would be an achievement for a French club,"" Mbappe added.

The last time a French team won Europe's premier club competition was in 1993 when Olympique Marseille beat AC Milan 1-0.

Although only 21, Mbappe has already made himself a major part of French football history by winning the World Cup two years ago and he has compared the mood in the PSG squad to that of Didier Deschamp's side in Russia.

Although the final will take place at the Estadio da Luz without fans, like all the games in the last eight due to COVID-19 restrictions, Mbappe says the atmosphere remains special.

""Of course, it feels strange to play behind closed doors but it's still the Champions League. You can feel it the intensity of the matches, the tension that reigns. It was a very special format this year, we will remember it for a long time because of the tragedy,"" he said.

PSG manager Thomas Tuchel said fit-again Italian midfielder Marco Verratti could be involved in the game, although probably not the full match.

Verratti missed PSG's quarter-final clash against Atalanta due to a sore calf but came off the bench for the final eight minutes of the semi-final win over Leipzig.

""Marco's injury was a blow, it wasn't muscular, that's why the risk isn't great. It's just a matter of pain. Does he have them ability to play 120 minutes? No, of course not. We have to decide tomorrow whether or not to start him,"" said the German.

Tuchel will also decide late on whether first-choice keeper Keylor Navas is ready to return or if he will stick with back-up Anthony Lopes.

Over the past weeks, several allegations and counter-allegations have come to light, but still, reports indicate that the investigating team is still far away from finding out the truth. Amidst the investigation, a new report claims to reveal the statement Neeraj Singh ‚Äì the late actor‚Äôs housekeeper narrated to the police about discovering SSR dead in his bedroom.According to a report on India Today, Neeraj detailed all that happened on the afternoon of June 14. He alleged that 2 key makers arrived at the actor‚Äôs house at around 1:30 pm. As the process was reportedly taking too long, the actor‚Äôs friend Siddharth Pithani asked them to break the lock. On completion of the work, the two were paid Rs 2000 by Dipesh and they left.Neeraj went on to narrate that when Dipesh came back, they opened the door to the room which was pitch dark and that the air-conditioning was on. When Deepesh switched on the light, Siddharth went in and came out quickly followed by himself and Dipesh.He alleged that the actor was hanging from the ceiling fan with a green cloth around his neck. Following this, he alleged that Siddharth called the actor‚Äôs sister Meetu Singh and told her about the death. After that, he alleged that Siddharth asked him to fetch a knife and they cut the cloth. He alleged that Sushant feet were outside the bed while the rest of the body fell on the bed.It was around the same time that Meetu entered the room and allegedly started shouting ‚Äò Gulshan tune ye kya kiya?‚ÄôHe also went on to claim that Meetu asked the men to arrange Sushant‚Äôs body properly on the bed.The housekeeper also stated that he was the one who removed the green kurta around the actor‚Äôs neck and that he even tried to resuscitate the actor by pumping his chest but to no avail.Following this, Siddharth called the police.According to the statement, the kurta in question was one of Sushant‚Äôs that he used to wear while performing puja.The CBI is currently investigating the case and has collected all the case record data, forensic files and evidence that the Mumbai Police has collected in its two-month-long investigation.The central agency has also started interrogating those accused and other witnesses in the case.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77699912,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-70398/77699912.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/is-this-what-sushant-singh-rajputs-sister-meetu-singh-said-on-seeing-her-brother-dead/articleshow/77699886.cms

KOCHI: As the surge in Covid cases continues in the state, the health department on Saturday has come out with revised guidelines clearly distinguishing between high-risk contacts and low-risk contacts, depending on the kind of exposure they had with a Covid positive person . This has been done to help in better contact tracing and quarantining A high-risk contact is any person who shared space within 1 metre of a Covid case for more than 15 minutes. They should have direct physical contact or live in the same household, share a room, meal or bathroom or travel with a Covid patient with shared space within 1 metre. Even those who have been directly caring for a Covid patient without using proper PPE, mask and hand hygiene, including health workers, are considered high-risk contact.On the other hand, lowrisk contacts are those who have shared the same time and space with a Covid patient but maintained social distancing along with face mask and frequent hand hygiene. The exposure to a Covid positive person should be from 2 days before to 14 days after the onset of the illness.While high-risk contacts need to be in 14-day room quarantine at home or institution, the low-risk contacts have been advised to avoid all non-essential travel or social functions and adhere to mask use and personal hygiene.‚ÄúIn situations where it is difficult to classify the exposure, a detailed exposure history should be taken and classification done on a case to case basis,‚Äù said principal health secretary Dr Rajan Khobragade A healthcare worker who comes into contact with a confirmed case with breach of PPE must undergo 14-day quarantine either at home or institution.

PUNE: Weekends with a games night , a concert or a party are all online now.

Staying home for the weekend is a precaution people are taking, and they seem to have found an eclectic balance between activities they would indulge in pre-pandemic and staying indoors.

Before the pandemic, Kharadi resident Aparajita Ghosh and her friends would have a games night every Friday.

‚ÄúNow, we get into a video conference , divide ourselves into groups and play charades or Pictionary. We decide on a cocktail and everyone makes one at home. We don‚Äôt take the risk of coming together,‚Äù she said.

Katraj resident Kamlesh Mulchandani said he and his friends went bowling online. ‚ÄúWe all downloaded the game on our Playstation and participated from our homes. There was ribbing, a competitive spirit and the losing team bought dinner for everyone. They ordered food online and sent it to the winning team members,‚Äù he said.

Staying indoors for the weekends, not gathering in groups at friends‚Äô homes or malls now that they are open, is not difficult and it can be really fun, he added.

A Potterhead from Vimannagar , Shiv Kohli, organised a Harry Potter marathon with his friends online. ‚ÄúYou can watch the movies or series together on Discord. You can watch your friends gameplay or get together for a movie marathon. Last weekend, we watched all the Harry Potter movies and chatted about it while watching. We also had a caterer deliver Harry Potter-themed snacks and beverages to individual houses. To make things more interesting, we dressed up like the characters,‚Äù he said.

Caterers are adjusting to orders and deliver to a specific address, sometimes set up the buffet or the table and come back to pick up the utensils the next day.

‚ÄúWe got inquiries for a themed menu and delivering portions to different addresses. We need to change as per the needs of our customers and figured out a way. We are catering to finger-foods, cocktails and themed meals based on movies or video games,‚Äù a caterer from Kondhwa said.

For those who miss the nightclubs, DJs old and new are playing sets on their social media channels every weekend. ‚ÄúSince we can‚Äôt go to the nightclubs, on weekends we end up watching our favourite artistes go live from their Instagram or Facebook accounts. We can also have a sidebar conversation with each other. Many bars are posting DIY videos of popular and new cocktails that you can try at home,‚Äù Koregaon Park Saili Wagh said.

People are also getting out their festive decorations. ‚ÄúI took out the fairy lights and put them up in my room. The dim yet colourful lights give me the feeling of being in a club and sets the mood for a party,‚Äù Sheena Satkar, also a Koregaon Park resident, said.

SOUTHAMPTON: Zak Crawley said he ""couldn't have dreamed for a better score"" after converting his maiden Test hundred into a superb innings of 267 against Pakistan at Southampton on Saturday before England great James Anderson rocked the tourists with a late treble strike.

Crawley and Jos Buttler, who made 152, shared a stand of 359 that powered England to 583-8 declared on the second day of the third Test.

England, 1-0 up in a three-match contest and looking for a first series win over Pakistan in a decade, then saw Anderson reduce the tourists to 24-3 at the close -- a deficit of 559 runs -- as he moved to within four of becoming the first paceman to take 600 wickets in Tests.

""I couldn't have dreamed for a better score I'm absolutely delighted and we're in a very good position with Jimmy at the end there,"" Crawley told Sky Sports.

Pakistan's Shan Masood was plumb lbw for four to Anderson before fellow opener Abid Ali (one) edged low to Dom Sibley at third slip.

And with what became the last ball of the day, Anderson had star batsman Babar Azam lbw for 11 with one that cut back to finish with stumps figures of 3-13 in 5.5 overs.

Pakistan batsman Fawad Alam, however, insisted that ""we don't think the match has finished"".

""We will fight it out and if we get two big innings everything will change. It's cricket and we are a fighting unit that can do that.""

England's total was their highest in Tests since they made 589-8 declared against Pakistan at Old Trafford four years ago.

Three of Pakistan's frontline bowlers conceded over 100 runs each, with leg-spinner Yasir Shah (2-173 from 39 overs) and teenage paceman Naseem Shah (1-109 in 27) both going for more than four an over.

Crawley's innings was the seventh highest maiden hundred in 143 years of Test-match cricket and the 10th highest score by any England batsman.

""It's very humbling indeed, I don't see myself anywhere near their calibre but hopefully I can build on this,"" said Crawley.

His partnership with Buttler was also a new England fifth-wicket record in Tests, surpassing the 254 shared by Keith Fletcher and Tony Greig against India at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai in February 1973.

""Jos was exactly the right man at the other end, telling me to calm down,"" said Crawley. ""He played better than me today, he was flawless.""

One of the few false shots of his innings saw Crawley go to 200 when he edged a four past second slip off Naseem.

But he still received applause from his team-mates in a match being played behind closed doors because of the COVID-19 outbreak.

The 22-year-old Crawley was the seventh England batsman to turn his maiden Test hundred into a double century and the first since Rob Key against the West Indies at Lord's in 2004.

Earlier, Buttler completed just the second hundred of his 47-match Test career and first as a wicketkeeper.

Crawley lofted Yasir over long-off for six before a clipped boundary off Mohammad Abbas saw him to 250.

But his near 10-hour innings end when he was stumped down the legside by Mohammad Rizwan off part-time spinner Asad Shafiq. Crawley faced 393 balls, hitting 34 fours and one six.

Together with Buttler, he had taken England from 127-4 to 486-5 against an increasingly ragged Pakistan.

World Cup-winner Buttler saw his seven-and-a-half-hour innings -- the longest of his career -- end tamely when he chipped a gentle return catch to Alam, another occasional spinner.

England resumed Saturday in a commanding position at 332-4.

Crawley was 171 not out, in his eighth Test, with Buttler unbeaten on 87.

Buttler, one ball after successfully reviewing a decision to give him out caught behind on 99, punched seamer Abbas through point to complete a 189-ball hundred with 10 fours and two sixes.

It was just the 29-year-old's second century in 47 Tests following his 106 against India at Nottingham two years ago.

437,['23/08/2020'],Shouting turns to violence in portland as dueling protests converge,"PORTLAND: Right-wing and left-wing groups clashed in front of theUScourthouse in Portland, Oregon , on Saturday, weeks after federal agents pulled back from the site of protests that have gripped part of the city‚Äôs downtown for months.

A group of about 200 protesters, including members of the Proud Boys and families supporting the police, gathered along the courthouse sidewalk beginning at 11 a.m. Many of them were holding American flags, while others carried assault rifles and wore tactical military gear.

Almost immediately, a similar number of Black Lives Matter protesters gathered across the street, many dressed in all black and carrying shields or paintball guns.

Within an hour, shouting turned to violence.

Paintballs flew between the two sides. Bottles soared back and forth. Shoves became punches. As protesters who were struck with pepper spray moved back, others came forward to take their place.

All the while, police officers watched from a distance and chose not to intervene.

The Portland Police Bureau said in a news release that it did not declare a riot because it had limited personnel for the number of protesters and weapons present.

The statement said that weeks of ‚Äúviolent actions directed at the police‚Äù were ‚Äúa major consideration for determining if police resources are necessary to interject between two groups with individuals who appear to be willingly engaging in physical confrontations for short durations.‚Äù

Several people were punched or hit with objects, although there did not appear to be serious injuries. Mike Redwood, a Black Lives Matter protester, said he was hit in the face with a baton and shocked with a stun gun during an altercation with far-right demonstrators.

‚ÄúI still have all my teeth and nothing‚Äôs broken, so I guess it‚Äôs not that bad for being hit with a bat,‚Äù he said while holding an ice pack to his cheek.

For about three hours, the two sides were in almost constant conflict, much of it violent. Redwood said that he and several other Black Lives Matter protesters had occupied part of the street and that he held his ground when the opposing line advanced.

After a majority of the right-wing demonstrators left, police officers declared the crowd unlawful and dispersed it.

Redwood said it was one of the more violent confrontations he had seen between right-wing and left-wing demonstrators in Portland.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen it to this degree,‚Äù he said.

Portland has been the site of some of the country‚Äôs most visible Black Lives Matter protests since George Floyd was killed in police custody in Minneapolis in late May. There have been protests of varying degrees downtown for more than 80 days.

The regular demonstrations prompted President Donald Trump to send federal agents to protect theUScourthouse, a move that mothers, veterans and nurses considered a provocation and protested against. Those agents, who fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters, have since been pulled back, and rallies have continued.

Susan Schaffer, who lives in Portland and joined the pro-police rally, said she was mortified by Floyd‚Äôs death. Still, she said she thought the protests had been allowed to continue for too long and with too much leniency from local leaders.

Karen Mann, who came to join the protesters from Salem, Oregon, said she was partly inspired to attend when her house was egged after she put a Trump sign in her yard.

The protests in Portland have fostered that animosity, she said.

‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I say I support Trump? I should be able to do that without being intimidated,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey really want to destroy everyone who is center-right or center.‚Äù

Turning away from the pepper spray that hung in the air, Andrew Benjamin said he worried that Trump and other conservative politicians would say that Saturday‚Äôs protest was an example of chaos caused by the Black Lives Matter movement.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll say Portland is burning. Portland‚Äôs not burning,‚Äù Benjamin said. ‚ÄúThis is one side of one block. It‚Äôs not even downtown; it‚Äôs right here, in front of that building.‚Äù

MUMBAI: As the 10-day long Ganesh Chaturthi festivities kicked off on Saturday, morning 'aarti' of Lord Ganesha idol was performed here this morning at the Shri Siddhivinayak temple for the second consecutive day.

The priest was seen offering prayers and performing 'arti' to Lord Ganesha.

This year due to the Covid-19 outbreak, temple authorities have urged the devotees to take an online glimpse of Lord Ganesha from their homes. However, several temples in the state have made proper arrangements of sanitisers and temperature measurements for visitors.

On this Ganesh Chaturthi, people can take the virtual darshan of Siddhivinayak and watch the 'aarti' live on the temple's website .

On Saturday, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray along with his family members offered prayers to Lord Ganesha at his residence in Mumbai.

The Maharashtra government has issued guidelines regarding the festival, stating that the processions should not be taken out before installing and immersing idols.Also, state home minister Anil Deshmukh has urged devotees to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi in a low-key manner and avoid crowding in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

The Hindu festival of Ganesh Chaturthi is dedicated to the Lord of new beginnings, Ganesha. The festivities will end with the immersion of the Ganesha idols.

442,['23/08/2020'],"As more colleges stay online, students demand tuition cuts","WASHINGTON: As more universities abandon plans to reopen and decide instead to keep classes online this fall, it's leading to conflict between students who say they deserve tuition discounts and college leaders who insist remote learning is worth the full cost.Disputes are flaring both at colleges that announced weeks ago they would stick with virtual instruction and at those that only recently lost hope of reopening their campuses. Among the latest schools facing pressure to lower tuition are Michigan State University and Ithaca College, which scrapped plans to reopen after seeing other colleges struggle to contain coronavirus outbreaks.The scourge has killed more than 175,000 people in the United States. Worldwide, the confirmed death toll crossed 800,000 on Saturday, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University, and cases passed 23 million.In petitions started at dozens of universities, students arguing for reduced tuition say online classes fail to deliver the same experience they get on campus. Video lectures are stilted and awkward, they say, and there's little personal connection with professors or classmates.Many schools, however, respond that they have improved online classes since the spring. Some have instituted decreases of 10% or more, but many are holding firm on price.At Michigan State, senior Tyler Weisner said the online classes he took last spring were less effective than what he gets on campus. Weisner, who started a petition to reduce tuition, said he's also missing out on many of the benefits of college.""You're paying that price tag because colleges bring students from all over the country together, to experience different cultures,"" he said. ""People don't just choose strictly off education or the professor. They want a nice place to live and a new experience.""Similar petitions have been started at schools from Rutgers University in New Jersey to the University of Southern California. Plans to continue virtual instruction this fall are further angering many students who were frustrated by the experience of studying online last spring, when colleges across the U.S. abruptly sent students home as the pandemic intensified.In the wake of that, students at more than 100 colleges filed lawsuits demanding partial refunds.It also renews a wider debate about the cost and value of a college degree. After years of increases, many students said they could barely afford tuition before the pandemic. Now, as families around the country struggle, many say there's a new need to rein in costs.Some colleges lowered tuition as they moved classes online, often acknowledging families' hardships and the differences in online classes. Several universities in Washington, D.C., lowered prices by 10%, including Georgetown University.Princeton University also cut tuition by 10%. In Massachusetts, Williams College announced a 15% discount after moving to a mix of online and in-person classes. Others, however, have refused. Harvard University is charging full tuition, about $50,000 per year, even though all undergraduate classes will be online this fall. The Ivy League school invited freshmen to live on campus while taking classes online, but about 20% have deferred enrollment, the university announced.Many colleges had hoped to bring students back, with major modifications. But after outbreaks at many of the first campuses to reopen - often tied to off-campus parties - some are retreating from their plans.The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill halted in-person instruction this past week after 130 students tested positive for the virus. The university is letting students cancel their housing contracts without penalty, and it's reimbursing students for their meal plans, officials said.But students will still be on the hook for hundreds of dollars in fees that aren't likely to benefit them, including $279 for athletics, $400 for student health, more than $200 for campus transit and $160 for student union center operations.""I think it's ridiculous,"" said Mackenzie Holland, a freshman who left UNC on Tuesday. ""All of those funds go to things that are specifically on campus, and I can't utilize any of those things."" At Michigan State, officials said they have no plans to lower tuition.They said other schools are cutting costs by leaning on part-time faculty or student assistants. Instead, Michigan State said it has invested in technology and faculty training to improve remote instruction.""Regardless of the format of instruction, MSU is delivering what students pay for: courses taught by high qualified and world-class faculty, tutoring services, office hours, academic advising and access to our libraries,"" spokeswoman Emily Guerrant said.Michigan State said the decision to keep classes online will cost the school millions in lost housing revenue. Ithaca College, which is not cutting tuition, said it's also taking a financial hit by telling students to stay home this fall.""Room and board is a significant piece of our revenue for the year, but this decision was really driven by putting the health and safety of our students first,"" said Laurie Koehler, vice president for marketing and enrollment strategy at Ithaca.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77700002,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1590577,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/education/news/as-more-colleges-stay-online-students-demand-tuition-cuts/articleshow/77699994.cms

KINMEN, Taiwan : The de facto US ambassador in Taipei joined for the first time on Sunday a Taiwanese leader, amid rising tensions with Beijing, to commemorate a key military clash and the last time Taiwanese forces joined battle with China on a large scale.

China, which claims Taiwan as its own, has stepped up military activity around the democratic island, moves denounced by Taiwan's government as an attempt at intimidation to force them to accept Chinese rule.

Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen laid a wreath and bowed her head in respect at a memorial park on Kinmen island, which sits a few kilometres (miles) off the Chinese metropolis of Xiamen , to mark the 62nd anniversary of the start of the second Taiwan Straits crisis.

In August 1958, Chinese forces began more than a month of bombarding Kinmen, along with the Taiwan-controlled Matsu archipelago further up the coast, including naval and air battles, seeking to force them into submission.

Brent Christensen, head of the American Institute in Taiwan and Washington's de facto representative, offered his respects too, standing behind Tsai, in a symbolic show of U.S. support for the island.

Washington has no formal ties with Taipei but is its largest arms supplier. The administration of President Donald Trump has made bolstering relations a priority, to Beijing's anger.

Like Tsai, Christensen did not make public comments.

Taiwan fought back at the time with support from the United States, which sent military equipment like advanced Sidewinder anti-aircraft missiles, giving Taiwan a technological edge. The crisis end in a stalemate.

Major General Liu Qiang-hua, spokesman for the Kinmen garrison, said it was important to remember an event that was so crucial to ensuring Taiwan's security.

""Of course we hope there is no war, but it is dangerous to forget about war. This is the spirit we need to safeguard,"" he told Reuters.

Formerly called Quemoy in English, Kinmen today is a popular tourist destination, though remnants of past fighting like underground bunkers are scattered across the island, and Taiwan maintains a significant military presence.

445,['23/08/2020'],Transport dept to rent out tram depots to fund revamp of fleet,"Kolkata: The Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC) of the transport department is letting out portions of its seven tram depots across the city for commercial purposes, the rental proceeds of which will be utilised to further modernise the tram and bus fleets run by the Calcutta Tramways Company.

The department is expecting to generate ‚Äúsubstantial‚Äù rental income by letting out these properties most of which are either located in upscale neighbourhoods or commercially lucrative pockets. The department has already invited expression of interest from malls, retail stores, banks, restaurants and showrooms to take these properties on rent.

Soon after coming to power, the Trinamool government had auctioned land parcels in several of its depots for a period of 99 years, the proceeds of which went to fund the VRS of ‚Äúnon-productive‚Äù staff and procuring modern buses.

‚ÄúThe rentals will be according to the market rates in the respective areas where the depots are situated,‚Äù said an official of the transport department. ‚ÄúThese units are located in prime areas which will benefit eateries, retail stores, banks and showrooms. Some of them are even spread over multiple floors,‚Äù said an official of the transport department.

The units that are being let out are situated inside Tollygunge depot, Ballygunge terminus, Gariahat depot, Behala, Garia and Nonapukur. ‚ÄúThese are not land parcels but built spaces anywhere between 600 sq feet to around 4,000 sq feet.‚Äù

Another official said the rental proceeds will be used to further modernise tram and bus network as the city‚Äôs suburbs are expanding and the need for road connectivity is high. ‚ÄúWe have procured several e-buses and plan to buy more while we phase out the older ones that cause a lot of pollution. There are plans to procure more buses and modernise the trams,‚Äù said the officials.

The agreement will be for nine years with a rent escalation according to prevailing rates after every three years.

In October 2013, the CTC had decided to lease out for 99 years 373 cottahs lying idle with six tram depots, taking the first major step towards restructuring the ailing transport department firm. Some of the biggest names in city‚Äôs real estate and retail space had bid for the land.

In 2015, too, the government decided to facilitate construction of residential and commercial properties in some depots to generate funds, but the plane did not materialise.

LONDON: Dillian Whyte 's hopes of a world heavyweight title fight suffered a major setback when former Olympic champion Alexander Povetkin twice came back off the canvas to knock out the British fighter.

Whyte, 32, had been the WBC's number-one contender for over two years and was hoping victory behind closed doors on Saturday would pave the way for a world title shot at either defending champion Tyson Fury or Deontay Wilder.

Whyte twice put Russian 40-year-old Povetkin down in the fourth round but was then knocked out in fifth by the former WBA world champion.

""I didn't feel I would finish the fight like this. I was confident in the fourth round even after going down twice,"" Povetkin told Sky Sports after winning the bout courtesy of a devastating left hook.

Promoter Eddie Hearn added: ""When the punch landed, I thought it was a dream. I can't believe it.

""Two heavy knockdowns from Whyte - people felt it was over. This is the drama of heavyweight boxing . One punch completely changed the fight.

""It is a shock. He wasn't that much of an outsider - we knew how good Povetkin was. It was a thrilling knockout on a thrilling night.""

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police on Saturday detained nearly a dozen gym owners protesting near the lieutenant governor's office for permission to reopen fitness centres in the capital.

The LG Anil Baijal-chaired Delhi Disaster Management Authority had on Wednesday allowed hotels to reopen and granted permission to weekly markets to operate on a trial basis, but had denied operation permit to gyms and yoga centres.

Delhi Gym Association has been demanding reopening of gyms since the Unlock process began. ""We have been urging the LG to reopen gyms because they are closed for nearly five months now, and it has affected the livelihood of over one lakh people employed in various positions,"" Chirag Sehti of DGA said.

The gym owners, who had gathered near the LG office with placards in support of their demands, were detained and taken to Civil Lines police station. ""The establishment and maintenance costs are mounting, rents have to be paid, fixed charges of electricity have to be paid, but we are without any income. The LG's decision to not reopen gyms will destroy the industry dearly and leave thousands of people without any source of livelihood,"" said one of the protesters.

Delhi government had earlier this month sent a proposal to the LG to allow gyms and yoga institutes, besides hotels and weekly markets, to reopen. However, during a review meeting, DDMA permitted only hotels and weekly markets to resume activity.

It was concluded in the meeting that people sweat while exercising, which might be a problem as others could come in contact with body fluids, thereby increasing the risk of spread of novel coronavirus.

Delhi Yoga Association, too, has planned to launch an appeal campaign on social media for getting yoga institutes reopened. Deepak Dadwal of Delhi Yoga Association said yoga lovers are eagerly waiting for the centres to resume activity.

451,['23/08/2020'],Three UP teachers to get national award for drive & innovation,"LUCKNOW: Three meritorious teachers from UP have been selected by the Centre for this year's national awards. The teachers are being honoured for their efforts in improving enrolment, motivating students to attend school regularly and taking teaching-learning to higher levels by bringing in innovation to classrooms.In all, 47 teachers from across the country will be honoured on the eve of Teacher's Day celebrated on September 5. The three from UP are - Mohammed Ishrat Ali, head teacher in a primary school, Rajwana in Mainpuri; Snehil Pandey, head teacher in a primary school Soharamau, Nawabganj in Unnao; and Vikas Kumar, principal, SD Inter College Meerapur, in Muzaffarnagar.Disturbed with lower rate of girls enrolling in schools, Snehil launched a unique scheme after taking over as school head in 2015 - of gifting a bicycle to one girl, who travelled to school from the farthest place on foot, from her own salary. As a result, there are 136 girls as against 130 boys currently enrolled in her school. ""The initiative helped us in mobilising people. In many cases, we saw siblings too joining our school,"" said Snehil, who dropped her studies in homeopathy to take up the cause of children.Promoting joyful learning in her school, she helped increase enrolment, from 60 in 2014 to 266 this year, by community participation. The school boasts of its own website, a students' newspaper and a music band. Each student at her school has adopted a plant. These measures have generated positive vibes among children. In addition, there is a library for parents. During the Covid-induced lockdown, Snehil took help from alumni to connect with students for online classes.Six years ago when Ali took over as the school head, there were 78 students enrolled in the school. And of this, only 45% attended school on an average. Through innovative experimentation and social participation, the number today stands at 216, and the attendance on any given day is above 85%. ""Using my own money, I started a stationery corner where students got stationery for free,"" said Ali. In 2015, Ali's school bagged the best school title in the state. Using the prize money, the school bought furniture for the students. Projectors were purchased to set up smart classes. ""When I was promoted as head teacher to another school in 2014, my students staged a stir-in before the DM. I was honoured by the love and affection of little children. Subsequently, I was promoted to the same school,"" Ali said.To make teaching-learning attractive, Vikas used videos on various topics and included characters like 'Motu-Patlu' which made topics interesting for students. In 2010, when Kumar took over as a school head, there were 767 students (from class IX to XII).Today, the student strength in his school is 2,350. ""We engaged students in making innovative models in Atal innovation lab. Our focus is to develop, in students, a scientific temper,"" said Kumar. In his school, he has initiated a unique bank where students deposit 10 unused pens and in return, they are given one new pen, free of cost. He motivates students to take up social work and to build community assets.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77700145,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1272280,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/education/news/three-up-teachers-to-get-national-award-for-drive-innovation/articleshow/77700114.cms

MEDAN: A rumbling volcano in western Indonesia on Sunday unleashed an avalanche of scorching clouds down its slopes.

Authorities are closely monitoring Mount Sinabung on Sumatra, one of Indonesia's main islands, after sensors picked up increasing activity in past weeks.

The volcano in North Sumatra province was shooting smoke and ash more than 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) into the air on Sunday morning, and hot ash clouds traveled 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) southeast, Indonesia's Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation Center said.

Villagers were advised to stay 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) from the crater's mouth and should be aware of the peril of lava, the agency said. Air travel was not impacted by the ash so far, the Transport Ministry said.

There were no casualties from the eruption, said Armen Putra, an official at the Sinabung monitoring post. He said villages outside the red zone were not in immediate danger.

Some 30,000 people have been forced to leave homes around Sinabung in the past few years.

The 2,600-metre (8,530-feet) Sinabung was dormant for four centuries before exploding in 2010, killing two people. Another eruption in 2014 killed 17 people, while seven died in a 2016 eruption.

The volcano, one of two currently erupting in Indonesia, has sporadically come to life since then.

Sinabung is among more than 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, which is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the Pacific ``Ring of Fire,'' an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin.

His star appeal has attracted record crowds. His address at the Madison Square Garden in 2015 and then in the Silicon Valley two years later, both attracting more than 20,000 people, making the prime minister perhaps the only foreign leader in recent memory to have addressed such huge rallies in the US.His ""Howdy Modi"" address in Houston last September was attended by a record 50,000 people.

For the first time, a presidential campaign has created a coalition group for the Hindus.The rival Democratic campaign too is coming out with ideas and commercials to woo Indian-Americans.

BILBAO: Lyon stayed on course for a fifth successive Women's Champions League title with a 2-1 quarter-final win over Bayern Munich on Saturday.

The victory set-up a last-four clash against French rivals Paris Saint-Germain who ended English hopes with a 2-1 win against Arsenal.

English international Nikita Parris gave six-time champions Lyon a 41st minute lead thanks to a pass from Eugenie Le Sommer.

Amel Majri added a second goal just before the hour off a curling free-kick.

Carolin Simon cut the deficit for Bayern on 64 minutes and was desperately unlucky when she hit the crossbar 15 minutes later.

Bayern may have failed to emulate their men's team by reaching the Champions League final but PSG can still make it a double for the French capital.

Marie-Antoinette Katoto gave PSG a 15th-minute lead with a smart volley from a corner but Bethany Mead levelled for the Londoners, who were champions in 2007, six minutes before the break.

Young Danish star Signe Bruun hit the winner for the French side in the 77th minute with Katoto the provider.

NEW DELHI: After lying shut for more than five months, the iconic Sunday book bazaar will be back in business next weekend. The entire market will be sanitised before it reopens on Sunday and vendors have been asked to maintain social distancing.

The market, which was relocated to Mahila Haat in September last year, is one of the seven weekly markets that have been allowed to open on a trial basis in City-Sadar Paharganj zone, said Ira Singhal, head of information department of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation.

Another senior civic official added that 130-150 vendors would be allowed to set up their stalls.

Asharfilal Verma (61), vicepresident of Daryaganj Sunday Book Bazaar Patri Welfare Association, said that the 50-year-old market had never been shut for such a long period of time. ‚ÄúI have been selling books for over 22 years. This has been one of the toughest times for all of us book sellers, but we will work hard to make up for it. Bibliophiles will definitely return,‚Äù Verma added.

The iconic Daryaganj Sunday book bazaar has been shut since March 8. Mahila Haat is located next to the Shehani banquet hall.

Book traders say that the period of change in the academic year used to be their main selling period and they have been wrecked financially. ‚ÄúCompetitive exam books and academic books constitute bulk of sale. April to June is the key period for booksellers,‚Äù Verma claimed.

Kamar Saeed, president of the book bazaar welfare association, said that while there are 276 book sellers in the association, only 150-odd vendors come to set up stalls since the relocation last year.

The shifting of the book bazaar from cramped Daryaganj to an open and clean Mahila Haat now may turn out to be in its favour in the Covid era. ‚ÄúOnly educated people and students come to buy books and it will be easier to maintain social distancing at Mahila Haat. Entry can be regulated and we can ensure that only masked consumers enter,‚Äù he added.

Saeed said that many booksellers need loans to restart their business. ‚ÄúMunicipal officials have assured us that they will enrol the registered vendors in the central government‚Äôs scheme,‚Äù he added.

Till July last year, the muchloved Sunday book market was being held between Delite Cinema and Golcha Cinema. The decision for shifting the weekly book market came after the Delhi traffic police submitted a report saying that the book sellers occupied the footpath, leaving no space for pedestrians on the busy road.

NAVI MUMBAI: Navi Mumbai's NGO NatConnect that takes up causes of environment and nature has mailed CM and cabinet minister for tourism and environment, Aditya Thackeray, taking strong objection to planting mangroves uprooted near Vashi creek bridge to another location.

The green body has asked the state government to plant the mangroves close to the project site.

BN Kumar, director of NatConnect foundation in the mail said, ""This is like doing surgery on the leg for a hand injury! The impact of the destruction of mangroves is felt in the same geography. We see no point on doing compensatory planting in some other, totally unrelated area"".

Mangrove and wetlands are supposed to be natural barriers against floods. The tropical tree acts as the frontline soldiers against tidal water attacks on the coast by absorbing the force of the water flow. It also serves as the breeding ground for hundreds of species of fish and contributes to biodiversity,"" Kumar said.

""In view of this, we request you to instruct the revenue and forest department to plant mangroves in the project area itself,"" he further added.

""We have already seen the impact of planting trees away from project areas of Uran. JNPT has done compensatory plantation of terrestrial trees, with the help of forest department, miles away at Koproli Kalambusare, Uran, on hillock, in lieu of mangrove loss at Uran. Here too, the terrestrial plants did not survive,‚Äù said Nandakumar Pawar, head of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan.

466,['23/08/2020'],No crowds makes for a new world as tennis gears up for US Open,"NEW YORK: For her or against her, former world number one Victoria Azarenka says fans in the stands are a key part of the tennis experience.

""I feel like they create an energy,"" Azarenka said Saturday, after beating Donna Vekic 6-2, 6-3 in her opening match of the Western & Southern Open campaign on an eerily empty Grandstand court at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows.

""Those kind of magical moments always happen when there is a crowd, and it can swing each way,"" Azarenka said. ""I love that energy I feel like you can feed off.

""Sometimes you have the whole stadium against you and you kind of feed off of that, as well.""

Players are having to adjust, however, as tennis returns amid the COVID-19 pandemic that brought the sport to a halt in March.

""There isn't really an atmosphere, so that's obviously a little bit tricky,"" former men's number one Andy Murray said after his first-round victory over American Frances Tiafoe.

""I know it's a bit of a cliche, but you need to kind of create your own atmosphere a bit on the court. It's just not quite the same.""

Murray said that was even more important in the tiring, humid conditions.

""A crowd being there sort of maybe helps you focus a little bit more and sometimes gives you that little bit extra boost in terms of your energy or whatever, your concentration. It's certainly different in that respect.

""I thought I did quite well with that. At the beginning of the third set I made a big effort to give as much energy as possible on the court,"" Murray added. ""Fist pumping and trying to be positive. That helped a bit.""

ATP players are back in action this week for the first time since play was halted back in March.

The WTA resumed earlier this month with tournaments in Prague and Lexington, Kentucky, neither of which boast the massive courts of the tennis center where the US Open will start on August 31.

The center's biggest courts, the Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong stadiums, aren't in use this week, and Azarenka hopes the US Tennis Association won't try to fill them with virtual fans when the Open begins.

""I hope they don't put fake people, because that's going to be super weird,"" she said.

""To me it looks creepy"" she said of the ""virtual fans"" displayed electronically at NBA games in that league's quarantine bubble in Orlando, Florida. ""So I hope that's not going to happen.""

Even with no spectators, Murray said taking the court in a top level tour event was a big step up from the ""Battle of the Brits"" exhibition he played in June.

""These are some of the biggest events that we play on the tour against the best players in the world,"" he said. ""They go down on your record. My concentration and everything is significantly better at a tournament like this.""

NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Saturday appealed to the central government to cancel the medical and engineering entrance exams - JEE and NEET - in view of the novel coronavirus pandemic.

Sisodia also suggested using an alternative admission methodology this year and said the exams should not be conducted.

On Friday, the Union ministry of human resource development had said the Joint Entrance Examination (Main) and the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET-UG) would be conducted in September as scheduled.

""The government is playing with lives of lakhs of students in name of JEE and NEET. I appeal to the Centre govt to immediately cancel both exams and adopt an alternative admission process (sic),"" the Delhi education minister tweeted.

""To think that only exam is a way out for admission, is an impractical and conservative thought. When other countries can have admission though different methods other than exams, why can't it be done in India? You are putting the life of the students at undue risk in the name of holding exams (sic),"" Sisodia added.

There have been demands from several students and parents to postpone the entrance exams in view of increasing cases of Covid-19. The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a plea seeking postponement of JEE (Main) and NEET-UG examinations, which are scheduled to be conducted in September, amid spurt in number of Covid-19 cases, saying precious year of students ""cannot be wasted"" and life has to go on.

The singer has taken up a new role of being a TV show host and he is ""completely enjoying"" this new stint. While going back to the set has been ""exciting,"" it has also been a challenge for Arvind to shoot for two different shows considering the prevailing situation. From battling the constant fear of contracting the virus to being concerned about his and his family's health and safety, it's a challenge that Arvind feels each one of us will have to face. In a conversation with AT, Arvind Vegda talks about being on sets after a long break, living in the normal and more. Excerpts:Working in centrally air-conditioned studios is risky, but if you take proper precautions, you can control the environment as there are only select people present on the set unlike outdoor shoots where anyone can walk up to where the shoot is happening. So, when I shot for Khadkhadat, where other artistes visit the set, the studio would be sanitised every morning and we would keep it open for at least half an hour for fresh air circulation before starting the shoot. And we would repeat the process twice daily. For my other talk show Ha Moj Ha, for which I shoot once every week and connect with artistes through video calls, we only have three people during the shoot, so it is pretty safe. Apart from that, other safety measures that are followed include having limited crew members, temperature checks, social distancing, home cooked food etc.As I have to step out for shoots and other work related commitments quite frequently, I ensure I am extra cautious when I am at home. One this I am very particular about is that I sanitise myself completely before going inside the house. But it is quite challenging to follow such strict safety norms on a daily basis.Our profession is such that we have work in close proximity with each other, but we must now start working and brave our fears.

PATIALA: With the economy hit hard by the Covid-19 crisis, the state government has failed to clear payment for power subsidies being given to various categories of consumers during the first four months of the current fiscal.

According to official documents, the state government is yet to pay Rs 3,489.74 crore to Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) for free power. From April 1 to August 15, the state government was supposed to pay Rs 6,696.07 crore to PSPCL. However, the government has only released Rs 2,384.76 crore to the power corporation.

Records show that in April, the government released three installments of Rs 135.43 crore, Rs 165.87 crore and Rs 200 crore to PSPCL. In May, the government released three installments of Rs 100 crore, one installment of Rs 200 crore and one installment of Rs 535.3 2 crore.

In June, five installments of Rs 150 crore, Rs 16.25 crore, Rs 31 5.15 crore, Rs 117.95 crore and Rs 14.68 crore were released. In July, a single installment of Rs 150 crore and in August Rs 379.22 crore was released to PSPCL.

The state government also asked the power corporation to adjust electricity duty worth Rs 267.37 crore and infrastructure development fund worth Rs 821.57 crore collected by the power utility from consumers against power subsidies.

The total subsidy bill for the current fiscal stands at Rs 16,400.26 crore, which is more than 53% of the annual revenue requirement of the power corporation. This also includes a carry forward of Rs 5,297.55 crore from previous years.

Agricultural connections take up the chunk of subsidies (this year, Rs 6,810.51crore) . The government is also considering the proposal to fuel agricultural feeders with solar power to reduce cost of power subsidies provided to farmers.

NEW DELHI: Legendary batsman Sunil Gavaskar has described the current Indian Test side under Virat Kohli as the best ever, saying that the lethal bowling attack makes it more balanced than the teams of earlier eras.Under Kohli, India reached the top of ICC Test rankings and the team is currently at number one spot in the World Test Championship standings. The highlight of the team's success is the first Test series win in Australia in 2018-19 tour.""I believe this team is the best ever Indian Test team in terms of balance, in terms of ability, in terms of skills, in terms of temperament. Can't think of a better Indian Test team,"" Gavaskar said during the 'India Today's' e-Conclave Inspiration series.Gavaskar said what stands out in the current team is the ""varied bowling attack"" which can win matches on any surface, irrespective of the conditions.""This team has the attack to win on any surface. It doesn't need any help in conditions...they can win on any surface. Batting-wise there were teams in 1980s that were pretty similar. But they didn't have the bowlers that Virat has,"" the former captain said.Talking further about the world-class bowlers India currently has, Gavaskar said, ""Definitely without a question, India has got such a varied bowling attack today and that is so essential. There is a saying that 'if you don't take 20 wickets you won't win a match'.""We have got the bowling to take 20 Australian wickets on 1 run less than what India has scored,"" said the 71-year-old Gavaskar, who scored 10122 runs from 125 Tests between 1971 and 1987.While India have always had skilled batsmen and great spinners, it has been the development of a clutch of world-class fast bowlers like Jasprit Bumrah , Mohammed Shami , Ishant Sharma , Umesh Yadav and Bhuvneshwar Kumar that has made it the world's top team in recent years.On the current batting line-up, Gavaskar said the current Indian Test team can score more runs than the likes of Australia, which leads the ICC Test team rankings.""You need to score runs also. We saw that in England in 2018. We saw that in South Africa in 2017 when we went there.

The groups are historically underrepresented in clinical trials.The companies' vaccine has quickly advanced into late-stage testing, with some participants already getting their second of two doses.Physicians and scientists have been urging companies testing coronavirus vaccines to include Black, Latino and indigenous Americans in Covid-19 vaccine trials in hopes of building trust among at-risk populations.""We have a lot of campaigns to reach out to those communities because they are overrepresented in terms of COVID-19 illness, so we are very keen to have those individuals as part of our trial,"" Gruber said on Thursday. ""They have higher attack rates and they are most likely to benefit.""According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll in May, only half of Black Americans said they were somewhat or very interested in taking a Covid-19 vaccine.Gruber did not disclose the number of Native Americans enrolled in the trial, but said Pfizer plans to draw on ties from its Prevnar 7 pneumococcal vaccine tests in the southwestern United States.""I'm hopeful we'll be able to make further inroads in that community as well,"" he said.Pfizer and BioNTech expect to have data sufficient for an emergency use authorization (EUA) or to start a full submission in October, according to Gruber.The company does not need to finish recruiting the full 30,000 patients planned for the trial in order to have enough data to support an EUA, he said.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has said Covid-19 vaccine trials need to have a safety database of at least 3,000 individuals for each of the younger and elderly populations in which it is tested.Ultimately, the speed with which the vaccine can be approved depends on how quickly patients in the placebo arm become infected with the virus, starting about a week after the second dose is administered. That began this week.""We won't really know until we get a little farther,"" Gruber said.""We're following the rules that assure rigor,"" he added, saying the company was taking no short cuts.""I can't tell you what will happen politically,"" Gruber said, when asked about concerns the Trump administration might pressure companies and regulators to announce progress before the November election.Gruber said the companies were now in talks with the FDA about how to begin testing the vaccine in children, a group the regulatory agency itself is eager to gather data on.Vaccines work differently in children and adults.Gruber said vaccine tests often progress in stages, first in older adolescents, then younger adolescents, and finally in children. But younger adults have higher rates of reactions, such as fevers and sore arms, to Pfizer's vaccine than older adults do, Gruber said.Roughly 17% of adults between the ages of 18-55 in Pfizer's most recent trial had fevers after being given the vaccine, most of them mild, compared with 8% among those aged 65-85.There is a risk those reactions could be even more heightened in younger populations, he added.""Younger children - maybe that's not going to be tolerated. Maybe we're going to have severe fevers,"" he said. ""That's why we're adopting a very thoughtful, graduated approach.

473,['23/08/2020'],Changing weather prompts more fire fears in California,"A group of US Forest Service firefighters monitor a back fire while battling to save homes at the Camp Fire in... Read More

SAN FRANCISCO: An unwelcome change in the weather, with higher winds, temperatures and lightning that threatens to spark new wildfires was coming Sunday to parched Northern California, where firefighters have for nearly a week battled three huge ‚Äúcomplexes‚Äù of fires that have destroyed hundreds of homes and forced tens of thousands to flee.

Firefighters made slow but hopeful progress in battling the blazes on Saturday, aided by good weather but hampered by smoky skies that grounded water-dropping aircraft for some of the day. Reinforcements arrived to bolster overwhelmed crews, and evacuation orders were lifted in some areas.

But the changing weather brought fears of new fires overnight and warnings from state and local officials for residents in threatened areas to prepare to flee at any moment.

‚ÄúThere's not a feeling of pure optimism, but a feeling of resolve, a feeling of we have resources backing us up,‚Äù Sonoma County Supervisor James Gore said.

Since Aug. 15, state fire officials said more than 12,000 lightning strikes across the state have ignited more than 500 wildfires. Of those, about two dozen major fires were attracting most of the state's resources. Most of the damage was caused by three clusters of fire ‚Äúcomplexes‚Äù that were ravaging forest and rural areas in and around the San Francisco Bay Area . They have burned 1,120 square miles (2,900 square kilometers).

Among the casualties were ancient redwood trees at California's oldest state park, Big Basin Redwoods, plus the park's headquarters and campgrounds. Smoke from the fires made the region's air quality dangerous, forcing people to stay inside.

Overall, the fires have killed five people, torched nearly 700 homes and other structures and forced tens of thousands from their houses.

‚ÄúTuesday night when I went to bed I had a beautiful home on a beautiful ranch,‚Äù said 81-year-old Hank Hanson of Vacaville. ‚ÄúBy Wednesday night, I have nothing but a bunch of ashes.‚Äù The changing weather brought good news for some communities, including Boulder Creek, an old logging community of about 5,000 people in the Santa Cruz mountains.

Fire officials said they expected the blaze to reach the community, but they took advantage of recent good weather to try to ‚Äúherd‚Äù flames around the town.

The storms predicted for Sunday were expected to aid those efforts by changing the direction of the wind.

‚ÄúAs bad as that weather prediction is overall for certain parts of this fire, it actually is going to help us move it away from those certain communities,‚Äù said Chief Mark Brunton, a battalion chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the state's firefighting agency.

Responding to the emergency, President Donald Trump issued on Saturday a major disaster declaration to provide federal assistance. Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement that the declaration will also help people in counties affected by the fires with crisis counseling, housing and other social services.

Fire officials, meanwhile, struggled to get enough resources to fight the two largest cluster of fires around the San Francisco Bay area that had grown to become the second-largest and third-largest fires in state history by size.

The fire burning in California's wine country, north of the San Francisco Bay, had only 1,400 firefighters assigned to battle the blaze. By comparison, the state had 5,000 firefighters assigned to the Mendocino Complex in 2018, which still holds the record as the largest fire in state history ‚Äî for now.

‚ÄúAll of our resources remain stretched to capacity that we have not seen in recent history,‚Äù said Shana Jones, the chief for CalFire's Sonoma-Lake-Napa unit.

Underscoring the danger the fires pose for firefighters, the Sonoma County sheriff's office released dramatic video of the helicopter rescue Friday night of two firefighters trapped on a ridge line at Point Reyes National Seashore. They were hoisted to safety as flames advanced.

‚ÄúHad it not been for that helicopter, those firefighters would certainly have perished,‚Äù Sonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick said.

475,['23/08/2020'],Northeast Delhi riots case: Court calls for forgery probe against lawyer,"File photo of northeast Delhi riots

NEW DELHI: In a case related to the riots in northeast Delhi in February, a Delhi court ordered Delhi Police's Crime Branch or Special Cell to investigate the allegations of forgery and false deposition by a complainant apparently on the ""instigation by a senior member of the bar"".

The court said, ""Since the preliminary enquiry was conducted, on the directions of local DCP, by ACP (Gokalpuri) and SHO, PS Dayalpur, it will be appropriate if the matter is investigated by an independent agency like the Crime Branch or Special Cell.""

The original case related to the complaint filed by Irshad Ali on March 4, about his shop being looted and burnt during the riots. Ali subsequently filed two complaints, on May 22 and July 14, accusing the investigating officer of malafide intentions. Since this became ground for a bail application of another accused, the court had directed the police to file a report in the matter.

The report of the DCP (northeast) was submitted before additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav. It alleged that Ali had changed his stance during the course of the litigation after a lawyer instigated him to ""depose falsely"" by way of a ""forged affidavit"". The report claims to quote Ali, who apparently told the cops that a lawyer who was representing another riot accused called him to his office and offered to assist him with an eyewitness in a similar case.

In his original police complaint, Ali had said his shop near Dayalpur was gutted by a group of rioters, none of whom he could identify by face. During the police enquiry directed by the court, the complainant claimed that the lawyer approached him earlier this month and claimed his client had seen the rioters burning his shop and requested him to agree to a joint complaint to make a stronger case in court. Ali agreed, though he said he had never seen the said eyewitness earlier.

Further enquiries established that the joint complainant was himself a suspect in a case of rioting and had been evading arrest since February. The new affidavit submitted in court by the lawyer had been signed by a notary named Sanjay Saxena. However, on checking the authenticity of the affidavit, Saxena's wife, who practises in the Karkardooma courts, told police that her husband died on November 14, 2017, and after his death she had ""no knowledge of any document attested under her husband's stamp"".

476,['23/08/2020'],Changing weather prompts more wildfire fears in California,"SAN FRANCISCO: An unwelcome change in the weather, with higher winds, temperatures and lightning that threatens to spark new wildfires was coming Sunday to parched Northern California, where firefighters have for nearly a week battled three huge ‚Äúcomplexes‚Äù of fires that have destroyed hundreds of homes and forced tens of thousands to flee.

Firefighters made slow but hopeful progress in battling the blazes on Saturday, aided by good weather but hampered by smoky skies that grounded water-dropping aircraft for some of the day. Reinforcements arrived to bolster overwhelmed crews, and evacuation orders were lifted in some areas.

But the changing weather brought fears of new fires overnight and warnings from state and local officials for residents in threatened areas to prepare to flee at any moment.

‚ÄúThere's not a feeling of pure optimism, but a feeling of resolve, a feeling of we have resources backing us up,‚Äù Sonoma County Supervisor James Gore said.

Since Aug. 15, state fire officials said more than 12,000 lightning strikes across the state have ignited more than 500 wildfires. Of those, about two dozen major fires were attracting most of the state's resources. Most of the damage was caused by three clusters of fire ‚Äúcomplexes‚Äù that were ravaging forest and rural areas in and around the San Francisco Bay Area. They have burned 1,120 square miles (2,900 square kilometers).

Among the casualties were ancient redwood trees at California's oldest state park, Big Basin Redwoods, plus the park's headquarters and campgrounds. Smoke from the fires made the region's air quality dangerous, forcing people to stay inside.

Overall, the fires have killed five people, torched nearly 700 homes and other structures and forced tens of thousands from their houses.

‚ÄúTuesday night when I went to bed I had a beautiful home on a beautiful ranch,‚Äù said 81-year-old Hank Hanson of Vacaville. ‚ÄúBy Wednesday night, I have nothing but a bunch of ashes.‚Äù The changing weather brought good news for some communities, including Boulder Creek, an old logging community of about 5,000 people in the Santa Cruz mountains.

Fire officials said they expected the blaze to reach the community, but they took advantage of recent good weather to try to ‚Äúherd‚Äù flames around the town.

The storms predicted for Sunday were expected to aid those efforts by changing the direction of the wind.

‚ÄúAs bad as that weather prediction is overall for certain parts of this fire, it actually is going to help us move it away from those certain communities,‚Äù said Chief Mark Brunton, a battalion chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the state's firefighting agency.

Responding to the emergency, President Donald Trump issued on Saturday a major disaster declaration to provide federal assistance. Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement that the declaration will also help people in counties affected by the fires with crisis counseling, housing and other social services.

Fire officials, meanwhile, struggled to get enough resources to fight the two largest cluster of fires around the San Francisco Bay area that had grown to become the second-largest and third-largest fires in state history by size.

The fire burning in California's wine country, north of the San Francisco Bay, had only 1,400 firefighters assigned to battle the blaze. By comparison, the state had 5,000 firefighters assigned to the Mendocino Complex in 2018, which still holds the record as the largest fire in state history ‚Äî for now.

‚ÄúAll of our resources remain stretched to capacity that we have not seen in recent history,‚Äù said Shana Jones, the chief for CalFire's Sonoma-Lake-Napa unit.

Underscoring the danger the fires pose for firefighters, the Sonoma County sheriff's office released dramatic video of the helicopter rescue Friday night of two firefighters trapped on a ridge line at Point Reyes National Seashore. They were hoisted to safety as flames advanced.

‚ÄúHad it not been for that helicopter, those firefighters would certainly have perished,‚Äù Sonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick said.

477,['23/08/2020'],A Math Teaching Guide For Online Classes,"Since Mathematics is considered difficult for most of the students, make sure that you don‚Äôt teach too many concepts in a single class. Start your online classes with the easiest of concepts so that the students feel comfortable in grasping the concepts. According Mr. Gaurav Tekriwal, who runs a Vedic mathematics course on Udemy, ""Teaching math online can be challenging but there are ways to make it a productive and positive experience. My advice is to always record the online classes and make them available to the students. That way, absent students can catch up and everyone can refresh their knowledge before exams. I also recommend that teachers put a lot of thought into how they connect with the parents too. In a fully digital environment, it is important to over-communicate and keep them informed about their kids‚Äô progress via email, WhatsApp, or other ways."" If you or your students find a certain topic challenging, refer to a free online resource such as Udemy for video lectures. Sometimes, a different approach can make it much easier to teach or understand a challenging topic. If using a whiteboard, try and use markers of different colours to write formulae, derivations, and drawings to make it more engaging. Make use of videos and animations wherever necessary. Engage personally, call out names of students randomly in between lectures to interact. In this way, the student will pay increased attention. Proper instructions are very important. Before each class, give proper instructions regarding the requirements of the next class. Give assignments and set rewards like points, badges and e-certificate on a good performance to encourage student participation. Review their performance periodically and encourage discussions. To give your best to the students, divide the class into small groups so that every student gets proper attention. Give separate time for discussion of students‚Äô problems. Dedicate a fixed amount of time in which only queries would be taken up. If due to some reason a query is left unanswered follow up in the next lecture. One of the best ways to increase participation is by getting regular feedback on various aspects of the class like its duration, the amount of syllabus to be taken up in a single class, and the frequency of classes per week.

The setup: A PC should have all the functionalities, applications, and configurations to support video call. Use good quality headphones so that the lectures are clearly audible. The accessories: Math class requires a geometry box, graph papers, pencils, log table, scientific calculators, etc. Make sure you have all the required items according to the unit being taught. Always keep the textbook with you because this would help you follow the lectures with ease. Make notes: Keep taking notes during the lecture. Write down the formulas and use keywords to avoid wasting time writing lengthy notes. Keep the recording of the lecture if possible so that you can revise at a later stage. Active participation and Honest feedback: Never feel shy to ask questions in case you have any doubt. Be honest with classroom feedback. To optimise the effectiveness of e-learning, it is imperative that you point out what‚Äôs good and what‚Äôs bad. Only then the teacher would be able to improvise it into a holistic classroom. Discipline and punctuality: Keep in mind that these are your school lectures, and you would be evaluated on their basis. Be on time and check for device battery status and connectivity beforehand. Set reminders so that you never miss a class. Maintain the demeanour of a regular classroom. Supplementary knowledge: The internet is full of resources that could be used to gain knowledge. Apart from the classes, numerous high-quality study materials in audio, video or text format are available over the internet. Sites like Udemy provide excellent tutorials and courses on various mathematical concepts that are generally free or have a nominal fee but are extremely useful as they explain the concepts in such a lucid way that Maths no longer bothers you.

It is always reassuring to see how humans never bow down in front of adversities. Even during the past few months, we have all stood together and found alternative ways so that essential life activities can continue. One such essential aspect is education.Schools and colleges were the first ones to make the shift to online learning. E-learning has become the new way of learning and teaching nowadays. Educationists believe that E-learning might prove to be better than conventional schooling as it allows a student to attend class remotely, hence, increasing attendance. As is it, children of this generation are tech-savvy, but they might never have imagined that online classes would replace their regular classes to such a large extent. Some leading schools have even announced that they will conduct classes in online mode, instead of a face to face interaction in a traditional classroom.It goes without saying that students will take time to get accustomed to the new paradigm. Parents, teachers, and students will have to play their part responsibly so that the goal of the online classroom is achieved fully. In fact, the role of parents in ensuring the success of the E-learning model is extremely important.One of the toughest subjects in the school curriculum is Mathematics. As per a study conducted by Cambridge International published in the Global Education Census 2018, Mathematics is the most studied subject in the world. Although there are a few challenges in teaching math over a PC, there are numerous advantages like using videos and animations to illustrate a concept, tips and tricks to learn complicated formulae, applications of mathematical laws and theorems in real life. Here are some tips for students, parents, and teachers to transform online Math classes into a smooth and comfortable learning experience.These sudden changes in the teaching and learning environment have paved the way for an evolution of traditional classrooms. The new version has infinite potential, provided all the stakeholders (parents, students, and teachers) do their part with complete dedication and cooperation. While we all hope and pray that we can go back to fun-filled traditional classrooms at the earliest, we should never stop our quest for knowledge. Like the Greek Philosopher Plato said, ‚ÄúNecessity is the mother of invention.‚Äù Our struggles today will only lead to a brighter tomorrow for our future generations.--------------------------------------------------------------PC Paathshala is an industry initiative by Intel in India with The Times Of India and multiple PC ecosystem players, to enable students, teachers and parents to adapt to online learning.

479,['23/08/2020'],Coronavirus pandemic : How to set boundaries for relatives,"When pandemic-related shutdowns started, many people rushed to the rescue of their loved ones. They rallied to meet an extraordinary situation and extended themselves in deep and loving ways. They welcomed home adult children with open arms. They jumped to babysit for their grandkids. They volunteered to shop for neighbors and elderly relatives.‚ÄúAt first, I thought, this is going to be great,‚Äù said Nancy Graham of Plainfield, Illinois, about sheltering in place with her husband and their three adult children. ‚ÄúI bought puzzles. I bought stuff to make candles. I was like, let‚Äôs watch a documentary a week! Let‚Äôs learn something!‚ÄùFive months in?‚ÄúIt‚Äôs awful,‚Äù said Graham, a real estate agent. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been years since we‚Äôve all been under the same roof for more than a week. I want to kill them, they want to kill each other, and my husband hides in his office.‚ÄùIndeed, with no end in sight, many people are wearing down. How long can they keep this up? Can they dial back their level of commitment, be it a pledge of time, money or emotional support? And why is it all so hard?‚ÄúAs a social species, we have this powerful, powerful need for emotional closeness,‚Äù said Michael Kerr, a psychiatrist and the author of ‚ÄúBowen Theory‚Äôs Secrets: Revealing the Hidden Life of Families,‚Äù based on the research of Murray Bowen, who viewed the family as an emotional unit. ‚ÄúAnd at the same time, we are allergic to too much of it. Therein lies the dilemma.‚Äù‚ÄúPeople are afraid to set boundaries, because they think it risks the relationship,‚Äù said Karen C.L. Anderson, author of ‚ÄúDifficult Mothers, Adult Daughters: A Guide For Separation, Liberation & Inspiration‚Äù and a life coach specializing in family boundaries.‚ÄúWhen you want to say ‚Äòno,‚Äô to a loved one, you‚Äôre afraid that they‚Äôre going to make that ‚Äòno‚Äô mean that you‚Äôre a bad mother or grandparent or friend. You figure, I‚Äôm just going to say ‚Äòyes,‚Äô so I don‚Äôt have to feel guilty later,‚Äù she said.‚ÄúBoundaries create a context for the preservation of love and peace,‚Äù said John Townsend, a psychologist who is the co-author of the Christian-themed book ‚ÄúBoundaries: When to Say Yes, How to Say No to Take Control of Your Life‚Äù and host of the ‚ÄúDr. Townsend Live‚Äù show on Crowdcast.‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt have boundaries, you‚Äôve got chaos,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBoundaries create an organized structure that people can go, ‚ÄòI can live with this. I can tolerate this. I can feel peaceful and still love people.‚Äô‚ÄùFor many people, that‚Äôs a lot more easily said than done.Jenny Lynn is a wife and the mother of two teenagers in Novato, California. Besides managing the pandemic‚Äôs extra toll on her immediate family, she has been providing an intense level of daily support to her divorced and separately quarantined parents, including handling their health and financial affairs. ‚ÄúI feel constantly pulled by everyone‚Äôs needs, and it‚Äôs never enough,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMy version of boundaries is if my dad calls six times in a day, maybe I don‚Äôt call him back right away. There have been days I wanted to get on a plane and go away. Not for good, but just for a break.‚ÄùWhen you feel overwhelmed, Townsend recommends that you create a list of all of your responsibilities and then identify what you alone can do and what can be outsourced. Ask a friend to share errands or shopping. Take turns venting.‚ÄúYou also have to determine that just because Dad‚Äôs calling me six times a day doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm the solution,‚Äù Townsend said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to have thick skin so you don‚Äôt personalize other people‚Äôs misery.‚ÄùJessica Gerber, a senior adviser for a national nonprofit who lives in San Rafael, California, has been working to establish good boundaries. ‚ÄúIn four days, we went from being empty nesters to three generations of six adults,‚Äù Gerber said. ‚ÄúOur adult kids moved back. My 87-year-old parents moved in. That‚Äôs 18 meals a day. It‚Äôs like running a boardinghouse.‚ÄùEstablishing ground rules was the first priority. ‚ÄúI had to be the sheriff,‚Äù Gerber said. ‚ÄúPeople behave better when they know what‚Äôs expected of them, so I said, No. 1, we all have to be kind to each other. No. 2, Grandpa needs to wear hearing aids. No. 3, everybody cleans up after themselves. Sunday‚Äôs cleaning day and you‚Äôve got to scrub the toilet, and I‚Äôm sorry if you‚Äôre 87, you‚Äôve still got to do it.‚ÄùThese boundaries may be helping, but if she ever intends to re-empty the nest, Townsend recommends creating what he calls a relaunch vision. ‚ÄúYou say, ‚ÄòHey, we know that you don‚Äôt want to be here forever,‚Äô‚Äù he suggested. ‚ÄúBut what can we think about to give you, and us, a vision for how great it‚Äôs going to be for you to feel autonomous and free and empowered?‚Äù The resulting conversation can help the younger person map out steps toward a relaunch.Many people made promises to loved ones back in March, not realizing how long the pandemic might last.Now that so many schools are opening remotely, what if your working adult children want you to babysit for your grandkids full time? Or what if you‚Äôre ready to retire as your elderly aunt‚Äôs or neighbor‚Äôs weekly grocery shopper? How can you create a new normal where your own needs are part of the equation?The first step, according to Anderson, is to realize that it‚Äôs OK that your needs have changed. ‚ÄúWe can always renegotiate our boundaries,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúJust because we‚Äôve agreed to something in one moment doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôve agreed to it for life. Remind yourself that you get to change your mind.‚ÄùNext, get clear ‚Äî with yourself first ‚Äî about exactly what you‚Äôre still willing to do. Then go into the conversation with kindness and clarity. ‚ÄúYou say you‚Äôve been happy to help so far, that we all thought this would be over by now, and it‚Äôs not. And then you tell the truth. ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt be at my best at this level, so I need to cut back‚Äô, or ‚ÄòI need to take a month off,‚Äô or whatever it is you really need,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou let them know, without defensiveness, without guilt, that you want to help them come up with a different solution that works for them, because this one isn‚Äôt sustainable for you.‚Äô‚ÄùAnderson says it‚Äôs important to make space for your loved one to feel heard. ‚ÄúThey need to feel how much you see and care about their needs, and that you are still there for them, even if it can‚Äôt be just the way they want.‚ÄùAnd that elderly aunt who needs groceries? ‚ÄúYou let her know that you‚Äôre still going to be there for her, but the model needs to change,‚Äù Anderson said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll help her sign up for delivery. Or you‚Äôll organize a few others to rotate duties.‚Äù‚ÄúAll you can do is be truthful about what you need going forward,‚Äù Anderson said. ‚ÄúAnd ask yourself, ‚ÄòDo I want my kids and grandkids to love me because I do something I don‚Äôt want to do for them? Or do I want them to love me because I‚Äôm honest and I‚Äôm being myself?‚Äô‚ÄùRe-establishing boundaries might not be easy, but the rewards can be rich. ‚ÄúBoundaries done right help people be more clear and more intimate, because there‚Äôs not the unspoken expectation, like, ‚Äòof course you‚Äôre going to keep doing this because you‚Äôre my mother and I need you to do it,‚Äô‚Äù Anderson said.‚ÄúWhen you can have the conversation without that baggage, you have the space to see each other as fuller human beings, not just the roles you play. It also helps you get to an outcome based on what‚Äôs really best for both of you.‚ÄùSo how do you let go if things don‚Äôt go well, despite your best efforts?‚ÄúIt‚Äôs OK to be upset,‚Äù Anderson said. ‚ÄúTolerating uncomfortable feelings builds emotional resilience. And standing in our truth is hard, but it‚Äôs the key to honest relationships. It‚Äôs also the key to creating healthy boundaries.‚Äù",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77700519,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-884019/77700519.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/de-stress/coronavirus-pandemic-how-to-set-boundaries-for-relatives/articleshow/77700507.cms

The Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) said that the Supreme Court's decision to entrust the probe into actor Sushant Singh Rajput 's death to the CBI had proved the ""incompetence"" of the Mumbai Police.

The ABAP demanded the CBI probed the lynching of two sadhus in Palghar, Maharashtra, on April 16.

ABAP President Mahant Narendra Giri said: ""The ABAP is holding an important meeting on August 26 in Haridwar in which, besides discussing preparations for the Kumbh next year, it will also pass a resolution for a CBI inquiry in the killings in Palghar.""

If the need arises, the Akhara Parishad would also go to the court, he added.

On the night of April 16, two sadhus and their driver travelling from Kandivali in Mumbai to Surat in Gujarat for attending a funeral amid the nationwide lockdown were brutally attacked and killed by a mob in Gadchinchile village in the presence of police officials .

Two seers, Kalpavriksha Giri Maharaj and Sushil Giri Maharaj , and their driver Nilesh Yalgade were brutally lynched while police allegedly stood as mute spectators.

""After passing the resolution, the Akhara Parishad will write to the Maharashtra Chief Minister to demand a CBI probe into the killings,"" said Giri.

The ABAP also demanded that huge gates should be constructed at all main entry points of the state in remembrance of former Vishwa Hindu Parishad ( VHP ) chief Ashok Singhal.

""Singhal gave his life for the cause of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. Now that the dreams of crores of Hindus has become a reality, we want he should be given the respect he deserves. The ABAP demands that huge welcome gates named after Ashok Singhal should be constructed on the highways connecting the state in all the four directions,"" he said.

PATIALA: A man claiming to be a lieutenant colonel in the Army has been arrested by Fatehgarh Sahib police in various cases of fraud. They have seized illegal weapons, ammunition and Army and Punjab Police uniforms from the accused, who claimed to have served as lance naik in the Army from 2002 to 2013.

Police officials said Shobraj was nabbed following a tip-off at a police barrier near Sirhind bridge on Thursday late evening. When he failed to produce any substantial documents to show his colonel rank, police arrested him and raided his rented accommodation in Mandi Gobindgarh.

The seizure included a .32 bore weapon, five cartridges, an air pistol and a walkie-talkie. The accused has been identified as Shobraj Singh, 35, and resident of a village in Ludhiana. He is also withdrawing a pension from Army on medical grounds. Police found fake ID cards, a stamp pad, 10 fake stamps, uniforms of colonel rank Army officer and Punjab Police, GO caps, and some other documents in his possession.

Fatehgarh Sahib SSP Amneet Kondal, said, ‚ÄúWe have booked the accused for cheating, forgery, criminal conspiracy, falsely impersonating as a public servant and under other relevant sections of IPC and the Arms Act. It seems he cheated a number of people on the pretext of getting them jobs in the Army. He was aware of the working of the Army and somehow managed to get the uniforms of a colonel rank officer. Besides, he also had uniforms of the police personnel. All this, besides some sensitive material, was recovered from his rented house in Mandi Gobindgarh.‚Äù

Cops also found that Shobraj was booked under the Arms Act in 2012 at Ludhiana‚Äôs Ladowal police station and a case of robbery was registered against him in Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh, in 2016. He had also managed to take two separate loans of Rs 18 lakh and Rs 10 lakh from private banks in Ludhiana in 2018. The matter is now under investigation.

484,['23/08/2020'],"Nepal govt's links with China affecting its autonomy, ability to take independent decisions: Report","KATHMANDU: As China continues to wield its influence over various countries , Beijing's nexus with the top establishment in the Nepal government has raised serious doubts over the Himalayan nation's 'autonomy' and 'ability to take independent decisions', according to a report in Global Watch Analysis.

According to an article by Roland Jacquard, the author explains China's policy of corrupting the political class of a country, especially those who are not economically strong. He also details how the foreign policy of Nepal, the latest entrant to fall victim to China's strategic expansionism, has veered towards pushing the interests of Beijing.

In January last year, the day when China condemned United States' move to slap economic sanctions on Venezuela, the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) also issued a similar statement denouncing Washington and its allies for intervening in Venezuela's internal matters. This was probably the first time Kathmandu had taken a stand pertaining to US policies in Latin America.

Another worrying and trend noticed in Nepal is the deteriorating human rights condition of Tibetan refugees residing in Nepal. The Himalayan nation shares a long border with Tibet and is home to over 20,000 Tibetan exiles, many of whom coming into the country after the Dalai Lama took refuge in India in 1959.

According to a recent report submitted to the United Nations (UN), two human rights groups -- Washington-based International Campaign for Tibet and the Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights -- have noted that the new arrivals of Tibetans to Nepal often face threats of being deported to China.

With the growing links between the Nepal government and China, Tibetan refugees are barred from holding elections to elect members of their refugee associations or celebrate the Dalai Lama's birthday, Jacquard writes in the article.

Attempts to protest against Chinese persecution are met with a heavy-handed response by Nepali authorities, says the writer.

To ensure that the top establishment of Nepal carries out China's bidding, the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu has been steadily building a network of loyalists, and doles are given out to them, many times on the pretext of legitimate jobs undertaken for the embassy.

For instance, the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu awarded a contract of 1.5 million Nepali rupees to Rajan Bhattarai, a member of the NCP and who is currently Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli's Foreign Affairs Advisor , for a research paper on Nepal-India relations. When the initiative started in October 2017, Bhattarai was a member of the Eminent Persons Group on Nepal-India Relations and the Chairman of the Nepal Institute for Policy Studies.

According to the contract, Bhattarai's wife Geeta Gautam while he would oversee the project. The payment for the duty was sent to Bhattarai's account in Nabil Bank .

""The contract was what the Chinese would call 'a win-win', as it not only found a way to engage a senior NCP functionary in a financial transaction, it also came with an added understanding of Nepal's policies towards India,"" the writer states.

Bhattarai was appointed as Foreign Affairs Advisor to Oli in November 2018. While it is not clear whether China played a role in his appointment, what is interesting to note that despite his position in the Prime Minister's Office, Bhattarai continued to keep contact with Li Yingqiu, a Chinese diplomat posted in the Nepali capital.

""With Nepal's Prime Minister's Office, including its senior advisors, known to have established a transactional relationship with China, it raises serious doubts about the autonomy of the government and its ability to take independent decisions,"" Jacquard says in the article.

486,['23/08/2020'],ISL: Bengaluru FC add Ajith Kumar to their defensive ranks,"BENGALURU: Indian Super League outfit Bengaluru FC have announced the signing of left-back Ajith Kumar from Chennai City FC. The 23-year-old defender joins the Blues on a three-year-deal, adding depth to the squad ahead of 2020-21 ISL season.

""I am thrilled to have become a Bengaluru FC player. This is a club I admire a lot and while I did have a few options to choose from, Bengaluru was top of that list at every stage of my decision making,"" Ajith said after joining the 2018-19 ISL champions as per the official ISL website.

""The chance to share a dressing with a legend like Sunil Chhetri who I hope to learn so much from, and so many of the national team boys is very exciting for me.

""I've watched a lot of Bengaluru FC games and have a fair idea of how the coach likes to play. I am happy to be part of any plan that he has for me. One thing is for sure, I will be giving one hundred percent every time I am on the pitch,"" he added.

487,['23/08/2020'],Keeping Students Engaged the HP way,"In the near aftermath of the Covid19 pandemic striking the globe a few months ago, the educational system in India was on the verge of a crisis when several players decided to help in making the transition from classroom teaching model to e-learning smooth for students, parents and teachers. While this revolutionary shift has been largely taken care of, there remains a major gap to be filled which has not been recognized by many. Locked in houses, with almost no social interaction with friends or outdoor activities, e-learning may not just prove stressful but also become boring for young learners. Realizing that this sudden switch to the web for learning could prove counterproductive, thereby affecting the interest and enthusiasm of students across the country towards e-learning, HP has jumped in to make a difference in their lives. How? At a time when schools and teachers are focused on completing the syllabus, HP believes a holistic learning approach doesn‚Äôt stop at just completing the syllabus. It goes beyond a set curriculum into exploring everything Out of Syllabus. The company has, as a result, introduced several unique initiatives focusing on things which are Out of Syllabus for kids but equally important, whether it is learning through experiences, making learning fun, involving physical activities in the learning journey, encouraging mental stimulation so on and so forth.Let‚Äôs dive into what these initiatives are and how are they making a positive impact in these difficult times:‚ÄòPrint, Play and Learn‚Äô is one such initiative where HP is offering free online resources to help teachers and parents of children between 2-12 years of age keep their kids enthused about learning in lockdown. The idea is to make education fun and play for the little ones so they do not feel bogged down by their course curriculum. For this reason, HP has joined hands with several education leaders including Education.com, TIME for kids, Canva, KiwiCo Gamooz and Harun Robert in order to curate literacy content as well interesting and fun activities like puzzles, working sheets, coloring pages among other printables. Using this, children can print out free, high quality and visually attractive printable materials using HP printers, and then use them to play, learn or create with their loved ones at any time of the day. Furthermore, it also plays a major role in enhancing children‚Äôs artistic capabilities while allaying the worries of parents around the negative impact of lockdown on their children‚Äôs education and mental health.As the name suggests, HP India‚Äôs #OutOfSyllabus initiative is another step towards helping kids break the monotony in their lives by interweaving the possibility of watching informative live sessions and creative videos. It means, with merely an HP laptop at home, students cannot just enjoy insightful virtual masterclasses and live sessions of interest in between their study time, but also indulge themselves in exploring new genres like music mixing, content creation and dance videos. Just how students had extra co-curricular activities in between classes back in school, this initiative holds similar relevance in kicking up/rejuvenating the performance of children in studies. The only difference is instead of kids moving around physically to learn these skills, HP has brought these co-curricular activities/workshops online for students in view of the lockdown limitations.For instance, HP kicked off its #OutOfSyllabus campaign with a live dance and video editing master class by Team Naach, a well-renowned dance group with a massive online presence across various social platforms like YouTube and Instagram. Students who love dancing or are attracted to this co-curricular activity did not just get a chance to see the dance talent of Team Naach live on camera, but they also learnt real insights free-of-cost from them on how to create engaging content, and edit & shoot high quality videos for social media. With its huge success, HP India now has an exhaustive line up of influencers ready to take center stage with their virtual masterclasses, just so students interested in different genres can take a break from studies and explore their interests or indulge in some out of syllabus productive activities which will ultimately only enhance their productivity in studies.Another major obstacle for students is finding the comfort and ease in the device they are using, considering most of their time is being spent on laptops in lockdown. Heavy or bulky laptops can cause real discomfort and pain. It is here that HP is making a huge difference in their lives with their thin & light PC offerings. These sleek laptops are especially useful for kids because they have been designed in a way so that students can carry them around easily at home. What‚Äôs more is that this range of HP laptops provide the option of changing the device into a convertible notebook. How, you may ask? Their USP is that they can be easily rotated 360 degrees and can be used in multiple modes as suited to the user ‚Äì be it tablet mode, stand mode, tent mode or even normal laptop mode. The screens with retina display feature avoid straining the eyes from prolonged use of these laptops. Needless to say, they come with an HD display ensuring clear picture quality and high quality B&O speakers for great audio which are extremely helpful features when it comes to anything, whether it‚Äôs attending lectures, live sessions, listening to podcasts or watching videos. This high quality and comfortable experience guarantees engaging students in the online productive activities they opt for.These initiatives are a testimony to the fact that HP has managed to hold on its leadership status by adapting to changing consumer demands and staying relevant in a continuously evolving marketplace over the past few decades. Even during a pandemic, it continues to strive towards addressing the real pain points and building a world-class learning ecosystem in India.Disclaimer: This article has been exclusively produced for Intel and Times of India initiative PC Paathshala to ease the transition to online learning.",spotlight,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/width-1000,resizemode-4,msid-77668733.cms",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//spotlight/keeping-students-engaged-the-hp-way/articleshow/77700590.cms
