0,['27/07/2020'],I was blown away by the response for my music including from Big B: Arya Dhayal,"“Drink some water, and hear this… Amitabh Bachchan has shared your music video.”When 24-year-old singer Arya Dhayal ’s father broke this news to her, the youngster from Kannur couldn’t believe her ears. “It became the best day of my life, I was simply blown away,” says Arya, whose phone has been flooded with calls and texts since then, and her social media following has been spiking like never before.On Saturday, Amitabh Bachhan, who is undergoing treatment for Covid-19 in Mumbai, shared Arya’s video of her singing a fusion of Ed Sheeran’s Shape of You with Carnatic raag Shudh Dhanyasi’s swaras, plucking her ukulele’s strings. He wrote, “I do not know who this is but I can just say ""girl you are a very special talent ... God bless you ... keep up the good work ... you have brightened my day in the Hospital like never before ... ""!! Mixing Karnatak and Western pop is not an easy task ... but she has done it with such finesse and aplomb … there is no compromise on either style ... simply amazing!! (sic)""“It’s just been a month since I bought my ukulele,” says Arya, who stays in Bengaluru. “In the past, I have tried to learn many instruments like violin and guitar, and failed. But ukulele just held on to my hands and I haven’t kept it down ever since. Singing with it has changed my life.”Arya, who first shot to fame in 2016 on social media for the recital of the controversial poem Sakhavu, has been winning a lot more of attention in the past few weeks from renowned musicians, ever since she began posting Western and Indian classical music videos on social media. “I have been learning Carnatic music for more than 20 years, but turned a lot more to it during the lockdown. I had just completed my post-graduation, and was staying in a paying guest centre. I had no space to play or practice, so every day, I used to go to my terrace at 5 pm, sing, and play for about two hours. That’s something that got me going,” she says.Interestingly, she has never received any training in Western music. “I have performed Western Music just once, in public. That was for a New Year celebration in Kannur a few years ago,” reveals Arya, whose latest viral video is a mix of a padam from Nalacharitham Day IV Kathakali and the song Believer by Imagine Dragons.The singer, whose social media followers include musicians Hariharan and Shahbaz Aman, confesses that her musical dream was never all about earning fans or followers. “I just wanted to share my ideas with those interested. And honestly, what I expected is criticism in return, as there were many cross-cultural elements in them. But the response has been encouraging,” says Arya, whose dream is to be an independent musician. “Not that I don’t like playback singing, but I love indie music more. I had released a song a year ago named Try My Self. I write and compose in English, and I hope to do a lot more of that.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77181304,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-82770/77181304.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/music/i-was-blown-away-by-the-response-for-my-music-including-from-big-b-arya-dhayal/articleshow/77181320.cms
1,['27/07/2020'],Rishi puts the focus firmly on the need to conserve water,"Water, or rather the lack of it, is a major concern for most parts of Karnataka , especially Bengaluru. Highlighting this crisis and the need for better water management is actor Rishi , who has been posting a series of videos on social media about the subject. In a video chat with Bangalore Times, he explains his new initiative and more.Tell us more about the videos and the objective…Water is not a popular selling point. Look at how we have lost our green cover. India was a country with surplus water, which, over time, became just adequate, and now, we are facing water scarcity . Now, the situation is such that in many parts of the city, people get fresh water supply only three days in the week. Since Bengaluru is facing acute shortage of water, I feel it is the fundamental duty of every citizen to find a solution to it. Everyone needs to do something to conserve the water, but we lack awareness about how to do it. The idea behind the videos is to create awareness, so that even if not tomorrow, a few years from now, we can overcome the water deficit stage. It is the responsibility of everyone to contribute towards the conservation of water.Are you looking at taking it up with the authorities?I have been discussing with my friends at the Indian Institute of Science and Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewage Board (BWSSB) to understand the real scenario and trying my best to see what we can do to change the current scenario. I am now looking at doing a video featuring people who are working towards conserving water and taking that to the authorities to find solutions to manage water.What’s happening on the work front?Sakkala Kalavallabha is in post-production now. We were planning to schedule its release, but that will have to wait, considering that cinema halls are still shut. I was shooting for Ramanavatara when the lockdown happened and that will be the film that I will shoot for when I resume work. I don’t see that happening for a while, though, as actors work in close proximity of each other, increasing the risk of contracting the virus. I think it will take us another couple of months to seriously discuss resumption of shoots.What is your take on films premiering on OTT platforms People are watching films on OTT platforms. I think OTT is a blessing for smaller films, as they don’t get enough screen. Post Coronavirus, the number of films made will come down, allowing those that are made to stay in theatres for a longer duration. People will also expect a lot of quality in Kannada films as they are now used to watching content-driven films on OTT.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77186375,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-161468/77186375.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/rishi-puts-the-focus-firmly-on-the-need-to-conserve-water/articleshow/77186375.cms
2,['27/07/2020'],Asif Ali’s Maheshum Marutiyum will have a car as its central character,"There’s something about Asif Ali and vehicles that spur nostalgia. While Vijay Superum Pournamiyum paid homage to the popular yesteryear scooter, his upcoming movie Maheshum Marutiyum will have the car occupying a larger space in the script.The upcoming film will be helmed by scriptwriter-turned-filmmaker Sethu , who previously directed Mammootty’s Oru Kuttanadan Blog. On the film that has Asif playing Mahesh, he says, “In essence, it’s a triangular love story between Mahesh, a girl and a Maruti 800 . Mahesh’s father brings this car in 1983 to his remote hamlet that has limited transportation access and since then he has an emotional attachment to the vehicle and everything in his life is connected to it. In fact, decades later, it’s just the car and himself that has not changed in the village. But then a girl enters his life turning it topsy-turvy.”Ask him why he chose the particular car and Sethu says, “Maruti 800 is a thing of nostalgia for a lot of people. It is also weaved into the socio-political fabric of Kerala because before the arrival of that car in 1983, we never had parking sheds for vehicles in our residences; it became a status symbol for us.”Sethu says that he was set to make his directorial debut in 2015 with Maheshum Marutiyum and had even approached a leading actor. But he decided to go ahead with Oru Kuttanadan Blog first. “You rarely get to make your directorial debut with a megastar like Mammootty and I grabbed that opportunity with both hands. But I always wanted to do this film and all my friends including Sachy asked me why I didn't do this film? A prime reason why I have revived the film now is Maniyanpilla Raju chettan, who is equally excited about the project and is also backing the movie,” he explains.The team is currently busy with its pre-production. “The composing for the film is in progress. We have also procured a car and its maintenance is being done now,” Sethu concludes.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77180640,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-247309/77180640.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/asif-alis-maheshum-marutiyum-will-have-a-car-as-its-central-character/articleshow/77180645.cms
3,['27/07/2020'],US-based Indian chef Sujan Sarkar feeds hundreds of Americans amid the pandemic,"He has impressed Leonardo Dicaprio, Sundar Pichai and Jude Law with his extraordinary culinary art. But in the past four months, Kalyani-born chef Sujan Sarkar, who works in Chicago, New York, San Francisco and Delhi, has turned his focus to feed hundreds of unemployed and elderly Americans who are badly hit by the coronavirus pandemic . Though restaurants have started welcoming guests in the US, primarily in alfresco areas, and workload has also gone up a bit, it did not deter Sujan and his team from cooking meals for those in need. “My father, Jiban Sarkar, is an agriculturist and food is something I understand very closely,” said Sujan.Sujan’s mission started in March, around the same time when chef Vikas Khanna started his Feed India campaign. Sujan, along with his partner, Manish Mallik, decided to deliver food out of their three restaurant chains in Chicago, New York and San Francisco. “I was in Delhi for two months before the lockdown was implemented. I flew back to Chicago on March 10, just before the lockdown started in India and got stuck here. The situation is a bit better downtown, where I am living right now, but I can’t go back to my place in New York yet. The situation is still bad there,” he told us over the phone.Initially, they started to deliver food for the frontline workers — doctors, medical staff and cops. “As things got better, we started cooking meals for people in rundown areas, where the pandemic hit the businesses hard. We also offer food to elderly and unemployed people,” said the chef, adding, “I don’t go out every day to distribute food packets. My partner, Manish does. We have our own supply chain and we maintain a strict hygiene routine. None of our staff members uses public transport. In fact, three of them live close by. Be it inside the kitchen or otherwise, we maintain social distance. Temperature is registered regularly and sanitisation work goes on all through the day. The hygiene standard is anyway very high here,” he said.Sujan’s team cooks around 300-600 meals per day. “We work through an organisation and a lot of local community members come forward to help. Local farms send us fresh produce to serve the people. We cook everything fresh and never use any frozen item,” Sujan said. In the 700 grams of meal, they provide equal amounts of vegetables, starch and protein. “We serve sauteed veggies, roast chicken and lightly buttered pulao. Sometimes, we try to add some desserts, kheer or carrot cake. That little something helps. The joy you see on their face is priceless,” Sujan confessed.The chef seemed to get a little carried away while elaborating his delivery experiences. “While delivering meals to police headquarters, the cops came forward to take selfies with us. In Englewood, the locals clapped and cheered when we gave them meal packets. These experiences can’t be described in words. I’ve cooked meals for several celebrities. But this is an extraordinary experience,” he said. “My father and his team are working on dragon fruit cultivation in Bengal. I wish I could develop the same food supply chain in India, from my Delhi outlet. I hear, things are still not great there. Once we start our operations, we hope to do something there as well,” Sujan said optimistically.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77185426,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-114113/77185426.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/food-news/us-based-indian-chef-sujan-sarkar-feeds-hundreds-of-americans-amid-the-pandemic/articleshow/77185426.cms
4,['27/07/2020'],Is your body getting its daily dose of protein?,"Vegetables and fruits provide protein

Our meals cannot provide sufficient protein

Protein supplements are required by those who gym or do an hour of exercise

Protein is required only to build muscles

Vegetarians cannot get adequate protein in their diet

Cheese – 24.1gm (per 100 gm)

Paneer – 18.3 gm

Chicken – 25.9 gm

Peanut butter 25 gm

Soy – 52 gm

The Protein Paradox study, conducted recently by a public health awareness initiative Right To Protein and research company Nielsen, surveyed over 2,000 mothers across 16 Indian cities, revealing that Indians consume inadequate levels of protein. The study shows that although 95% of the mothers surveyed claim to know protein as a macronutrient, only 3% understand the functions of protein or why one should consume it daily. Keeping this in mind, the Indian Dietetic Association has earmarked July 24-30 as ‘The Protein Week’. Supported by the Protein Foods Nutrition Development Association of India, this initiative aims at raising awareness about muscle health and educate people about the importance of protein.“Protein is not given the attention it needs and most people view it only as supplements. Also, eating out or ordering in and eating ultra-processed food and packaged foods, has affected protein availability in the diet,” says nutrition and wellness consultant Sheela Krishnaswamy.According to the study, over 70% of Indian mothers believed many common myths about protein, including it being difficult to digest and leading to weight gain. These myths have forced many to pick Vitamins and carbohydrates over protein for their families, including kids. “People need to understand that protein is a building block for the body, and it is a vital nutrient for growth, maintenance and repair of cells and tissues. It also helps to maintain immune health, which is required to fight infections,” says Sheela, adding that one needs to give the nutrient importance.“Very few studies have been published recently that provide insights about the consumption patterns of this ‘major building block’ of our lives. Hence, it results in less protein in our food,” says nutrition expert Dr Jagmeet Madan, who is also the president of Indian Dietetic Association (IDA). So, what then is the adequate protein requirement for a person? This varies from one individual to the other, say experts. But on an average, about 1 gm of protein per kg body weight per day is required for adults. For children, a little more than 1 gm per kg body weight per day is needed for growth and other functions.According to the recent study, people incorrectly perceived that milk, fruits, curd, rice, buttermilk and chapatis were high in protein, while they were unaware that the following foods were a high source of protein...",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77185967,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-216354/77185967.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/diet/is-your-body-getting-its-daily-dose-of-protein/articleshow/77185949.cms

Most of the things I had planned this summer didn’t end up happening, but there is something I hadn’t planned on that DID happen. And that thing is my 8th studio album, folklore. Surprise 🤗Tonight at midnight I’ll be releasing my entire brand new album of songs I’ve poured all of my whims, dreams, fears, and musings into. I wrote and recorded this music in isolation but got to collaborate with some musical heroes of mine; @aarondessner (who has co-written or produced 11 of the 16 songs), @boniver (who co-wrote and was kind enough to sing on one with me), William Bowery (who co-wrote two with me) and @jackantonoff (who is basically musical family at this point). Engineered by Laura Sisk and Jon Low, mixed by Serban Ghenea & Jon Low. The album photos were shot by the amazing @bethgarrabrant. Before this year I probably would’ve overthought when to release this music at the ‘perfect’ time, but the times we’re living in keep reminding me that nothing is guaranteed. My gut is telling me that if you make something you love, you should just put it out into the world. That’s the side of uncertainty I can get on board with.

7,['27/07/2020'],NHAI to beautify Ayodhya bypass for pilgrims &amp; tourists,"NEW DELHI: Statues of Hanuman, tiny flower gardens and fountains at regular intervals will be part of the major beautification of Ayodhya Bypass.

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has approved Rs 55 crore for beautification and civil construction works for this 16 km bypass. While civil construction to upgrade the existing bypass has started at Rs 35 crore since March this year, NHAI will open the bids for beautification work on Wednesday.

“It was decided to divide two components with full government support. The progress of civil works is about 30%. The beautification work will start soon as the government is paying for it. The contractor can start work as soon it bags the project,” said an official.

The works were approved after Faizabad MP, Lallu Singh put the demand before highways minister Nitin Gadkari . “The upgradation and beautification of the bypass will make the ride on this stretch fulfilling both for pilgrims who come here and for visitors as well. They will get a feel of reaching an important religious place. Several road projects have been approved and work has started around Ayodhya.""

The bypass provides connectivity to Prayagraj, Varanasi and other parts of the country. Singh told TOI that the Centre has provided enough funds for road development in the area, which will boost religious tourism and economic development. The roads that are being developed include the Ram-Janki Marg and 84 Koshi Parikrama Marg in this region.

Officials said that plantation of exotic plants on the median will also be put as soon as cement concrete kerbs are constructed.

This year, after working with Darshan Raval on 'Tere Naal', she has now collaborated with Punjabi singer Millind Gaba for the song ' Naam '. Presented by T-Series, written by Jaani and composed by Nirmaan, with music produced by Millind, the song is about how love always finds its way back despite all odds.A video was shot for it before the lockdown, which features Tulsi and Millind. Tulsi says, “We shot this single 10 days before the lockdown. The video is about a girl who stands by the boy she loves, even after he loses his eyesight. I trained for the contemporary dance sequence that I had to perform in the video. I also attended classes and learnt to play the cello for this video. The cello is a grand instrument, and you have to know how to hold it.”Millind Gaba shares, “We started working on this song nine months ago and wanted the composition to do justice to Jaani’s beautiful lyrics.” Composer Nirmaan says, “We kept the track simple and relatable.” Lyricist Jaani adds, “Love is a complex emotion, but the simplest way of explaining it is when people are there for each other no matter what the obstacles are, and that is what I am trying to convey with this song.”Talking about the song, which releases today, Bhushan Kumar says, “'Naam' is a song about unconditional love.

10,['27/07/2020'],Ritvik Arora out of ‘Yeh Rishtey Hain Pyaar Ke’,"While the production house says he is no longer a part of the show because of his unprofessional behaviour, the actor insists that he has not been able to resume the shoot owing to the COVID-19 situation. Read on...Two weeks ago, TV producer Rajan Shahi said in an interview that one of his lead actors was demanding an exorbitant fee hike and behaving unprofessionally in these times of COVID-19. Rajan refused to name the person and since then, there has been constant speculation about who the actor is, especially because currently, Rajan’s production house has three prime-time shows on air. All rumours have now been put to rest because we have got to know that the actor is Ritvik Arora , who plays Kunal Rajvansh in ‘ Yeh Rishtey Hain Pyaar Ke ’. When we spoke to Rajan, he confirmed the news. So, what went wrong between Ritvik and the production house?Rajan says, “A few weeks ago our supervising producer Vivek Jain called Ritvik. He said he could start shooting from July 1, but we should first speak to his father. That itself was unprofessional because he’s the actor, who has signed a contract with us. Yet, Vivek called his father, who asked for a raise in his remuneration, almost double of what he was being paid, and also a minimum 25-day work guarantee. What’s really wrong is the way he communicated it saying, ‘Don’t even think of calling back if you want to negotiate’. After this, Vivek reached out to Ritvik again, and even this time, he told us to speak to his father.”Rajan says he has always been open to discussion if anybody wants to relook at certain clauses in their contract. “Sometimes an actor or a technician may have some concerns and want a change in certain clauses. These things happen, but they have to be discussed proactively. I have always been approachable. But for someone to say that don’t even think of calling if you want to negotiate... negotiate what? You are going against the contract! When they were asked to send an email on this, they started dilly-dallying. A few days later, Ritvik’s father started sending apology messages for laying down those conditions and tried to blame things on the COVID situation. However, we have a record of all communication exchanged.”Rajan adds, “We have been very accommodating with actors who have genuine COVID concerns. If an actor wants to opt out of a show, we totally understand. But the behaviour of unprofessional people, who hold a production house to ransom, should be called out. In the case of Ritvik, there was a problem even last year when he didn’t turn up for shoot for a day and he was not reachable on phone, and we suffered losses. He apologised later in writing and we gave him another chance then.”Meanwhile, the production house is in the process of shortlisting an actor to replace Ritvik. “No matter how popular an actor maybe, it’s his work ethic and professionalism that is of paramount importance to me. If that is not there, I don’t mind replacing him,” says Rajan.According to Ritvik, COVID-19 is the main reason why he isn’t returning to Mumbai from Delhi. He says, “My uncle passed away recently because of coronavirus, so obviously, everyone in my family is worried. Then we learnt about actor Parth Samthaan testing positive, which furtherfuelled their apprehensions.”Ask him about his father’s demands for a pay hike, and he replies, “I first received a call from Rajan Sir in May, asking me when I would be able to resume the shoot. I informed him about my uncle passing away and said that I needed some time. I asked my father to take the communication ahead with the production house, as I was deeply affected by my uncle’s death. A few days later, Vivekji called me, and I told my father to talk to him and decide whether I should go to Mumbai to shoot. I am their only son and they were anxious because I would be living alone in Mumbai. I didn’t know about the conversation that transpired between my father and them. After I learnt about it, I told my father that he was wrong in asking for a pay hike. However, he didn’t ask them to double my money, he asked for a minor hike thinking that it would serve as a deterrent and they wouldn’t call me to Mumbai. My father was willing to send me to shoot from July 1, as he thought things would get better. He called them several times to clear the air, but our calls went unanswered. I asked him to apologise through messages and on mail. In his apology, my father stated that it wasn’t about the money, but about my safety and well-being. I totally understand their decision to not respond. However, I can vouch that my father wasn’t rude, nor did he tell them to not call him for negotiation. In fact, I received a mail from them on July 7 asking me when I would return. I didn’t want to commit to a date as I wasn’t sure if I would be able to stick to it, owing to the ongoing crisis. So, I wrote a mail stating that as of now, I don’t plan to return to Mumbai. There is absolutely no reason for me to leave the show because it’s such a good opportunity. This is a case of miscommunication and misunderstanding.”About the incident that took place last year, when he went missing from the shoot for a day, he says, “Back then, there were issues from both sides. I don’t want to delve into it, because it’s in the past. In my submission, all I want to say is that if I was so unprofessional, they wouldn’t have retained me.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77187863,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-229306/77187863.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/ritvik-arora-out-of-yeh-rishtey-hain-pyaar-ke/articleshow/77187757.cms
11,['27/07/2020'],30 Years of Keladi Kanmani: Raaja sir’s music gave life to the climax: Vasanth,"It was a film that not only marked the debut of a noteworthy filmmaker in Tamil cinema, but also one that showcased the actor inside one of our greatest singers — SP Balasubrahmanyam . As Keladi Kanmani , which released on this day in 1990, turns 30, we speak to its director, Vasanth , who recalls the journey of the film, which started out as an offbeat project but ended up as a memorable blockbuster.Producer Vivek Chitra Sundaram had called up Vasanth, who was an associate director of K Balachander then, to his office and asked him if he could direct a film for his production house. ""Maybe he thought that just like how he was making Pudhiya Paadhai with Bhagyaraj’s assistant Parthiban at that time, he should make one with KB sir’s assistant. I said I’d get back to him. When I told my family about his offer and my reaction, they scolded me, saying, I should be thankful that I’m getting a producer without me getting a story ready and approaching many producers to produce it. That was the surprise start of this film,"" begins Vasanth.The director says he had a clarity on what kind of films I wanted to make. ""I like my mentor’s films like Aval oru Thodarkathai and Apoorva Ragangal. To me, the films that he did in that period, like Avargal, Manmadha Leelai, they are all classics. I like Mahendran sir for the realism in his films. And I like Mani Ratnam for his aesthetic sense, filmmaking technique and screenplay. I was also crazy about Balu Mahendra and Satyajit Ray. So, as an assistant director, I was influenced by all these directors. I wanted to do a film that was mature for my age. So, a romance between two mature people was the starting point,"" he says.Vasanth had worked with SPB in KB's Manadhil Urudhi Vendum, in which the singer played a cameo as a doctor. He was impressed by SPB's realistic acting style. ""In my subconscious mind, I had this strong impression of him as a good actor, so we roped him in as an acting coup. SPB sir was a superstar then and he had sung thousands of songs even by then, but he was not an actor. So, I thought it would be a first to have him as a lead,"" he recalls.When he approached the singer, SPB told him, ""If the film doesn’t do too well, I have my singing career to fall back on, but what will you do? Why do you want to take such a risk?"" But Vasanth insisted that he act because he wanted his ARR (AR Ranganathan) to be a character, which would not be possible with a popular face.He says the film's producer, Sundaram, liked the idea of SPB playing a hero that he started the film immediately. Vasanth says he was in tears when he saw the double positive (which will have only the video and audio, and no re-recording or effects) and later presented him with a Maruti car.Vasanth's first choice for the female lead was Suhasini. ""She was a wonderful actress and a friend of mine. Radikaa hadn’t worked with KB sir, but Suhasini had. But Suhasini was acting round-the-clock at that time, and couldn’t take up the film. My very next choice was Radikaa. She is one of my favourite actresses, and I think one of the greatest in Tamil cinema. She immediately accepted the film and did a fabulous job. She even got the Filmfare Award for her performance, though I feel that she deserved a National Award. She was so fantastic,"" praises the filmmaker.He says that he cannot forget the way Radikaa performed in the scene in which her parents die. ""She requested me to give her 20 minutes to be ready for the shot. She discussed the scene with me for five minutes and went into a room and did not talk for some time; it was like she was doing some meditation. And then, she came out and broke down in front of the camera in a great way. It was a single shot, with many things happening in the background, and she was wonderful all that time,"" he gushes.Ramesh Arvind was cast because Vasanth worked with him when KB remade Sollathaan Ninaikiren as Sundara Swapnangal in Kannada, and they shared a great rapport.For Anju’s role, Sukanya was one of my early choices. She was about to be introduced by Bharathirajaa then, so she couldn’t take up this film. Vasanth also asked Ramya Krishnan, but she was busy with something. ""Anju was more or less a new face, and many were apprehensive if she could pull off such a weighty role. But since I was a KB sir student, I had the audacity to take a risk. After speaking to her, I had the belief that she would do it,"" he says.Baby Neena had acted in Mani Ratnam’s Idhayathai Thirudathey in a small role, and Vasanth cast her as ARR's daughter. ""She was a school kid and had exams at that time. And she’d fall asleep on the set during night shoots. But she had an extraordinary talent and was a natural performer. We vibed very well,"" he says.Other than Mannil Indha Kaadhal Indri, Ilaiyaraaja composed the rest of the songs in just half-an-hour, Vasanth informs. ""The only thing he asked me repeatedly was if I would use the song Karpoora Mullai Ondru in bits in a few scenes. I told him yes, it would be like something that haunts the characters, and make audiences expect for the moment when we would play it in its entirety. Believe it or not, he composed the songs in the time that it would take to actually play all those songs. I did not have to ask for a second choice. Everything that he came up with was great to listen,"" he says.Vasanth recalls the special care that the maestro took for the re-recording of the film. ""In those days, he used to finish the re-recording of a film in three days. For this film, he had completed two days of work, but the third day happened to be Pournami. And at that time, he used to go to Thiruvannamalai without fail on Pournami days. Only the climax reels were left, so my producer asked me to request Raaja sir to not go there this time and finish our film as we had fixed the release date. When I asked Raaja sir, he said, ‘Who told you that I’d finish this in a day?’. When I told him that he usually takes only three days for an entire film, and we had only two reels left, he remarked, ‘Poda! Those two reels make the film, and I have planned three days of re-recording for those two reels alone.’ It was Raaja sir’s music that gave life to that climax,"" he praises.Mannil Indha Kaadhal Indri was not part of his initial plan, Vasanth says. ""I felt that making SPB a singer would be an expected move. That is why he was an odd job man in the film. But at the same time, I wanted to show the character’s singing talent in a scene, and I kept thinking how I could do that. Suddenly this idea of breathless singing struck me during the shoot, and since SPB sir was there, I told him about this. He said it would be great, but laughed and askedhow I would finish the film, for it would be impossible for anyone to sing for five minutes without taking a breath. Though there is a misconception that he has sung the entire song without taking a breath, he actually sang that way for 40 seconds. When Raaja sir heard the idea, he liked it, but said that we should have it in the charanam and not in the pallavi because people could then sing the pallavi.""",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77187894,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-314906/77187894.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/30-years-of-keladi-kanmani-raaja-sirs-music-gave-life-to-the-climax-vasanth/articleshow/77187894.cms

When work dried up in the big cities during the lockdown , many thousands of men from Rajasthan ’s Udaipur and Rajsamand districts trudged back home. Vijay Ram, a 28-year-old from Kuchauli panchayat in Rajsamand, says just thinking about the long journey gives him the shivers. He’s not going back “at least this year.” And he has a good reason to stay home now.In the two months since they returned, Vijay Ram and others like him have changed the face of their villages. There’s piped water at last, long-neglected wells have been repaired, and agriculture has become more than a means of subsistence. “Earlier, we only grew grains, but this year we have sown vegetables also.”Tourists visiting Udaipur and Rajsamand take back memories of their rugged hills but life for the locals can be hard, especially in the tribal villages where water is scarce. That’s why up to 95% of men in some blocks migrate to Mumbai or Surat for work.Read more from this seriesThe workers who returned home because of the lockdown didn’t have to worry about rent anymore, but they still had to put bread on the table. “At that time, it was hard to say what was worse, staying on in the city or returning home. We were out of work, money and hope in both places,” says 35-year-old Tola Ram from Udaipur’s Boramcha village.The returnees decided not to sit around and lament their fate. “We began with efforts to arrange food and water in the village,” says Tola Ram. In Kanela, another village in Udaipur, they turned their attention to community works. The village didn’t have a water tank, so they made many phone calls to the collector’s office and the block development officer, says Ganesh Naal Gamethi, a resident.“Our perseverance paid off when the village got its first 5,000-litre overhead tank. Then came the taps. Until recently, women fetched water from wells or used handpumps. The two taps installed in our village have made life a bit easier,” Gamethi says proudly.In other villages, the returnees are digging new wells, repairing old ones and raising crops with the new sources of water. “This is a tribal belt where families have low access to resources like drinking water, sources of irrigation, etc,” says Saloni Mundra , knowledge and programme support executive at the NGO, Aajeevika Bureau, which is supporting the projects financially.The NGO’s help and the hard work put in by the people have transformed many villages in two months. Vijay Ram says they now use a pump to irrigate their fields. He expects a surplus that can be sold in the market. Putting bread on the table does not seem so hard anymore.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77185747,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1102765,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/job-drought-in-cities-brings-water-and-taps-to-rajasthan-villages/articleshow/77185754.cms

14,['27/07/2020'],"Here comes Sorkalam, Tamil’s answer to Scrabble","Mother tongue as a sense of comfort

Like with most families, Scrabble is a staple board game at Chennai-based couple Santhanakrishnan R and Preetha Raghavan ’s household. Over the years, their pastime has often included playing the game with their daughter. One such round of the word game, however, ended up being an epiphany for them — what if they could play the very game in Tamil ?This is the story behind their recent invention, Sorkalam, a Tamil word game. “Most of us have grown up with Scrabble, among other word games. Sorkalam struck me as an interesting idea because we often tend to play a lot of English word games, but not Tamil ones,” says Santhanakrishnan, a consultant in the field of artificial intelligence and data analysis.While Santhanakrishnan came up with the idea way back in 2016, he revisited it last October, to come up with a prototype, along with his wife. “For this to work, we had to think of a few things like the number of tiles and distribution of points,” he says, adding that Thirukkural and vernacular magazines helped analyse how different word combinations worked. “We then started working on a prototype with scissors, pen, paper and small cardboard pieces. We knew we were on to something,” Preetha explains.This was followed by a lot of trial and error before they zeroed in on the final product, she says, adding that figuring out a way to blend the uyir-mei-ezhuthukal on the board was the biggest challenge. Out of the total 165 tiles, 90 are wooden ones with Tamil letters, 55 are symbols/diacritics and the rest are blank tiles, which can be played as any letter or symbol.“In industrial design, we have a concept called design thinking, which involves a lot of improvisation. We made 20 sample boards and distributed them to people whom we did not know, to get genuine feedback. It was real fun developing the game as it was playing it,” notes Santhanakrishnan.The board game would have hit select stores by now if not for the pandemic, the couple says with a grin, adding that the game is now available online.While the lockdown has prompted many to give board games a try, the gaming culture should not be restricted to today’s times, they add. “Board games are an important part of growing up for most kids, and for some, the love stays on for much of their adult life too. As for the lockdown, we wouldn't wish the game needs a crisis like the lockdown for its adoption. We wish the virus goes away, people get well, and happily play the game,” says Preetha.The game inevitably lets people explore numerous Tamil words in the process, the couple adds. “In daily life, it takes time to think of Tamil words. This was the feedback we got from people who played the game. A few have even said that the game helped connect to their Tamil-speaking parents better,” Santhanakrishnan says.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77187987,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-978724,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/here-comes-sorkalam-tamils-answer-to-scrabble/articleshow/77187987.cms

But as he delineated the circumstances of Pakistan’s “betrayal” by attempting to stealthily grab land and to deflect attention from its internal troubles at a time when India was trying to improve relations, the similarity with China’s aggression along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) was striking, even though the PM did not mention China even once in his address.PM Modi, while quoting a Sanskrit shloka, termed Pakistan an incorrigible enemy who compulsively sought to harm everyone, even those who tried to help them, a description that seemed to apply to China as well. “To the wicked, enmity with one and all for no reason comes naturally,” he said.He said people with such a disposition kept thinking of harming even their wellwishers. “Such enmity will eventually prove costly for the ‘dusht’ itself, like Kargil did in the case of Pakistan,” the PM said, indicating a resolve to confront the border intrusion. Modi also made references to attacks by opponents back home as some have insisted that the government has downplayed the incursion.“At times, without paying heed to the essence, we encourage certain things on social media that are detrimental to the country. We keep forwarding things out of sheer curiosity. Despite knowing that it is wrong, we keep doing it. These days, battles are fought not just on borders, they are fought within the country too, on many fronts simultaneously,” he said.Modi quoted Atal Bihari Vajpayee ’s Red Fort speech in 1999 in which he had cited Gandhi’s mantra. “Mahatma Gandhi’s mantra was — in the face of any dilemma, in order to decide what to do or what not to do, one must think of the poorest and the most helpless person of India,” the PM quoted Vajpayee as saying.“Going beyond Gandhiji’s thought, Atalji had said that the Kargil war has given us another mantra, and the mantra was — before taking any important decision, we should think whether our step, our endeavour, is befitting to the honour of the soldier who laid down his life in those remote mountains,” he added.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77188151,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-119108,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/on-kargil-day-pms-tough-talk-on-dusht-pakistan-a-hint-to-china/articleshow/77188148.cms

The results point to the five sectors mentioned earlier, which are adversely affected by the pandemic.Incidentally, construction was doing badly even before the lockdown with over 24% of loans to this sector being classified as non-performing as on March 2020. This is second only to gems and jewellery where nearly 25% of the loans had already turned bad.Within the tourism sector, about 90% of the respondents said recovery within the sector in the next six months appear bleak. The aviation sector appears to be a close second, with about 85% categorising the future prospects as bleak. Bankers said aviation is most likely to require support as the sector is highly leveraged, has high fixed costs and is among the most affected.According to the survey, the effects of Covid are likely to remain for 3-5 years and may impact the quality of credit in the banks’ books, the general risk-taking ability of entrepreneurs, investments in capital markets and real estate, and the saving pattern of households.In the survey, the categories that appeared in the ‘very high risk’ categories include global growth, domestic growth, fiscal deficit. This is the first time that the survey has thrown up so many ‘very high-risk’ categories, which is an indicator of the likeliness of the risk event happening. In the previous survey, no item was classified under this category.The number of ‘high risk’ items have doubled to 16. The new high-risk items include contagion risk following any other sovereign defaulting, the inability of corporates to raise foreign borrowings, risk that foreign portfolio investment and foreign direct investment may flatten. The domestic risks that are categorized as very high include slowing down of infrastructure spending, real estate price crash, rupee volatility, stock market volatility, liquidity risk and social unrest arising out of increasing inequality.In the financial sector, the existing stock of non-performing assets in the banking system and bankers’ risk aversion remain big worries and impediments to economic growth. About 56% of the respondents opined that the prospects of Indian banking sector are going to deteriorate considerably in the next one year, as earnings of the banking industry may be negatively impacted due to slow recovery after the lockdown, lower net interest margins, elevated asset quality concerns and a possible increase in provisioning requirements.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77197252,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-161932,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/covid-hit-tourism-msme-aviation-worst-rbi-survey/articleshow/77188304.cms
19,['27/07/2020'],Viral Acharya warns against monetisation of deficit,"Former RBI deputy governor Viral Acharya (File photo)

MUMBAI: Former RBI deputy governor Viral Acharya has cautioned against monetisation of the fiscal deficit , warning that it could trigger run-away inflation and external sector stress. Acharya’s warning comes at a time when there is a growing chorus for the government to provide an economic stimulus by borrowing money directly from the RBI.

Acharya’s criticism of deficit monetisation is part of his book ‘Quest for restoring financial stability in India’ (published by Sage). “Monetisation of fiscal deficits by the central bank participating directly in the primary market for government debt or indirectly in the secondary market through its liquidity management operations would mean regressing to errors of the 1970s and the 1980s,” said Acharya. “The constant refrain that given the lack of fiscal space, the central bank must accommodate that growth is a slippery slope,” Acharya said.

According to Acharya, for a sustained recovery, there is a need to clean up the financial system. “The historical strategy of levering up yet another asset class to grow when prior leverage boom has gone bust and its mess not yet cleaned up has repeatedly failed, this strategy has repeatedly derailed the Indian economy’s long-term growth plans, unsurprisingly there is no asset class left to lever up and structural reforms are now critical,” he wrote.

In the book, Acharya has blamed the NBFC/real estate defaults to the glut of deposits that ended up with public sector banks following demonetisation. “Bank deposit rates fell and savers searched for yield through liquid-debt mutual funds; these funds in turn sought a higher yield in the short-term commercial paper of non-bank and housing finance companies,” Acharya said.

The situation in rural areas is worse as most dentists have shut their clinics.Indian Dental Association-Bihar president Dr Mohit Kumar told this newspaper that nearly 15 dentists, mostly from Muzaffarpur, had tested positive for coronavirus “Majority of the dentists in small towns and rural areas have pointed out that practices like thermal screening, pulse measurement, sanitization and fumigation as well as the use of PPE kits, masks and gloves will prove to be an additional burden that they cannot afford. Hence, the cost of consultation and treatment has been raised,” Dr Mohit said.Dr Kundan Singh, a periodontist with a clinic in Buddha Colony, claimed that many specialists had switched to the old hand-driven instruments for scaling and filling of teeth in order to minimize the emission of aerosol through a patient’s mouth and nose.The 35-odd dental clinics in the area between Jagdeopath and Saguna Mor in Patna are all closed. Dr Vaibhav Shandilya, a maxillofacial surgeon, said, “Under the new normal, most of us are depending on telemedicine. Surgeries related to accidents, cancer or tumour, on the other hand, have been delayed.”At his New Dak Bungalow clinic, orthodontist Dr Neal Kedia has doubled the fee for dental treatment. “I have to make sure that there are disposable PPE kits and masks for the patients and the clinic is sanitized regularly,” he said.A Muzaffarpur-based dentist, Dr Harsh Singh, claimed that only 30 of the 150 clinics in the town were open for limited hours.Similarly in Gaya, almost 65 of the 70 dentists have shut their clinics. “These include those falling under the containment zones with larger number of corona patients,” Dr Sakeb Khan Afridi said.Dr Vivek Vikas of Purnea also pointed out that there were 100 dental clinics, of which only 30 were functioning.

The two have ironed out their differences over certain terms and conditions and a deal will be announced soon, said people familiar with the negotiations.Future’s interests are spread across various entities, including six listed companies. RIL will acquire the retail, supply-chain and related businesses of Future, which will mark the end of founder Kishore Biyani ’s play in India’s modern retail, an industry he pioneered. A point under discussion has been Biyani’s role after the deal. One of the people quoted earlier pointed out that companies in which RIL acquires a minority stake, the founder-promoters continue to manage the show, with the energy-to-telecom enterprise occupying board seats, and not otherwise.A second person said that the deal has taken time due to disagreements over the valuation of Future Retail , the flagship of Biyani’s enterprise. Future Retail, meantime, is facing increased liquidity pressure after it missed interest payments on its US dollar-denominated bonds last week. Subsequently, Fitch cut its credit ratings on the company. Promoters own 42% in Future Retail, which runs hypermarket chain Big Bazaar and neighbourhood grocery chain Easyday Club, but 75% of the holding is pledged as on June 30, 2020.“The board members of Future have finally agreed with the final contours of the deal that was being worked out among the parties. A resolution will be passed over the next few days,” said a person familiar with the development. Biyani is likely to retain the FMCG and residual businesses of Future, the person added. The deal will be financed through a mix of share-swap and cash.Emailed queries sent to RIL and Future didn’t elicit any response till the time of going to press. India’s No. 2 retailer by turnover, Future has been compelled to look for an acquirer after rising debt, falling valuation of its listed entities and a decline earnings due to the pandemic, started to weigh on it. The market value of its listed companies plummeted 74% to Rs 10,464 crore in one year and its debt has exceeded Rs 12,000 crore.The potential deal underlines RIL’s ambitions to dominate the Indian retail sector as it combines the online and offline formats.

23,['27/07/2020'],13% of TMBU research theses rejected on ground of plagiarism,"BHAGALPUR: Nearly 13% of theses submitted for PhD by research scholars were found to have been plagiarized and were rejected by the Tilkamanjhi Bhagalpur University ( TMBU ).

As of now 39 research theses, which includes 23 of social sciences, 07 in humanities and 09 in science were found to have more than 35% of plagiarized content out of nearly 300 theses submitted since July 2018, when TMBU implemented steps to stop plagiarism for doctorate and other related degrees. Prof Equbal Ahmad, professor in-charge of university central library (UCC) and Anti-Plagiarism Centre (APC) confirmed that 39 PhD thesis were found having more than 35% of plagiarized content and have been rejected and the research scholars have been asked to make requisite changes.

The research board of TMBU, after a thorough discussion on the UGC rules, ratified and made an overall cap below 35% in making references of other published thesis or contents in any new research thesis. “If the new research thesis is found to have more than 35% of plagiarized content, the research paper is rejected,” said TMBU officials.

It may be worth mentioning that the University Grants Commission (UGC) had formed rules regarding anti-plagiarism stating therein that researchers who are guilty of plagiarism could lose their registration and the researchers’ guides stripped from their jobs.

“The UCC at TMBU has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Information of Library Content (INFLIBNET) to stop plagiarism,” said Prof Ahmad adding with the help of ‘URKUND’ software provided by the INFLIBNET (Inter-University Centre of UGC at Gandhinagar, Gujrat), detection of plagiarism was possible.

Prof. Ahmad said URKUND is a fully-automatic machine learning text-recognition system made for detecting, preventing and handling plagiarism in all languages. Soft copies in the form of CDs of the thesis needs to be uploaded online for checking plagiarism through URKUND.

“Research scholars, who want to pursue PhD and other similar degrees have to take ‘No Objection Certificate’ (NOC) from the APC,” added Prof Ahmad.

TMBU VC (in-charge) Dr Ajoy Kumar Singh said the objective to enforce anti-plagiarism is to improve the quality of education and research in the universities and institutes of higher learning.

Nobody came forward to help fearing he had Covid and, after he died, the body was left unattended for several hours.

When he was referred to the city hospital, Madhab Narayan Dutta’s wife Alpana managed to help him down from the second floor of the Bongaon hospital and walked him to a waiting ambulance. However, he collapsed while getting into the vehicle. The incident prompted Bongaon Jiban Ratan Dhar subdivisional hospital authorities to initiate an inquiry into the alleged negligence of hospital staff.

“My husband suddenly collapsed, got injured and fell unconscious. I raised an alarm but nobody came to attend to him. Later, a doctor came and told me that my husband had died,” Alpana said.

Alpana’s brother Joydeb said, “His body was lying unattended for hours on the premises.”

Later, a civic team from Bongaon municipality took the body to a crematorium.

Shankar Kumar Mahato, superintendent of Bongaon hospital said, “We have received a complaint and are looking into the matter seriously. If some hospital staffers are found guilty of negligence, stern action will be taken against them.”

If your relationship is solid with your significant other, you probably won't dream of cheating on your partner. And so, if you ever get dreams where either you are cheating or being cheated upon, do not run straight to your partner giving out every single detail. You dreaming about cheating doesn't necessarily mean you are looking for a sidepiece. In fact, having a cheating dream can actually mean almost anything. Even in dreams where you see your partner playing you, depends on your past experiences.It could mean you are feeling guilty about something in your real life. Guilt or concern about something you are doing can be the main reason for you to see such dreams.It could also mean that your current relationship is missing something that you need. If you feel that excitement and passion are missing in your relationship, you might go on dreaming about it with someone else.Another big reason could also be because you might have a harmless crush on someone else. This could also lead to cheating dreams.It could mean that there's a third wheel in your relationship that's affecting you in unknown ways. You aren't particularly jealous or insecure in real, but the thought of your partner spending time or being close friends with someone else might affect you deeply and result in such dreams.Another major reason could be because you don't trust your partner. Maybe you caught them red-handed flirting with someone else or that they don't take interest in you anymore or simply want to spend time without you. This could result in trusting issues which ultimately makes you dream of your partner cheating on you.Dreams, where you're being cheated on, could also mean you are very insecure about your relationship in real life.

There is no fixed working time,” she said.Vikash Kumar, a resident of Bhootnath Road and employee of an automobile company, said job insecurity was very difficult to deal with. “The company has already reduced our salary by 30% and fired some employees,” he said.Like Vikash, Neeraj Sinha also complained of frustration, anxiety and restlessness. “I started losing sleep mainly due to office messages which pop up on my cellphone throughout the day.

32,['27/07/2020'],"Discounts, offers by 2-wheeler companies make a disappearing act this monsoon","Chennai: Discounts and incentive schemes have disappeared from the motorcycle and scooter market even though July-August monsoon months — Shradh or Aadi — are the weakest marketing periods for two wheeler sales.

Under a normal circumstances, company and dealer schemes as well as discounts during this season leading up to Shradh in the north vary from around 7%-10% of vehicle price. But this year, lockdown losses and a demand that’s higher than supply have meant neither companies nor dealerships are offering any discount. “Right now no company or dealership is offering any discounts or benefits except may be in some niche geographies,” said Nikunj Sanghi who runs Hero Motocorp dealership JS Fourwheel Motors in Alwar. Normally, Q2 is the weakest quarter for two wheeler sales due to the monsoon and shradh and companies use this time to build inventory for the festive season. “That’s why discount/benefit offers ranging between Rs 1,500-Rs 3,000 is normal during this monsoon season,” added Sanghi. This year however the discounts have vanished. Several reasons have contributed to this. “Because of BS6 transition inventory pipelines were empty when the lockdown happened,” said Sanghi. “Now two wheeler companies are taking time to ramp up production and the supply constraint is a bigger challenge than demand which is boosted both by rural pull and the pent-up demand.”

Also dealers have suffered heavy losses during the 45-60 day zero sales period so “they cannot afford to pay any discounts,” he said.

Financiers say so far June-July hasn’t been a washout. “June sales of two wheelers were good and loan disbursements were also good. I am told July isn’t as good as June,” said YS Chakravarthy, MD, Shriram City Union Finance, India’s largest two wheeler financier by volume.

Dealers however say the percentage of financed vehicles and the percentage of financing have both fallen with banks and NBFCs turning cautious. “Earlier 90% of on-road price could be financed but now it is 75% and financiers are also cautious so the cash sales have been going up particularly in semi urban and rural markets,” said a FADA official.

The accused identified as Kunwar Pal Banjara , resident of Ram Nagar under Thatia police station of Kannauj, was arrested in the small hours of Sunday, said Kannauj SP Amrendra Prasad Singh.

Banjara had allegedly murdered a security guard of the Rewa royal museum in 2012, and was arrested five years later in 2017. He was then released on bail in 2018, but he jumped the bail.

“He kept shifting his location to evade arrest. The court had then issued a non-bailable warrant against him and he was declared a ‘proclaimed offender’,” said the SP.

As per police, they had received a tip-off about his arrival in Kannauj. They kept track of Banjara and arrested him on late Saturday night.

Police said Banjara, against whom 27 criminal cases remain pending, is also in the list of top ten criminals of the district.

The robbery at the royal museum had occurred on October 18, 2012. Banjara and his gang had targeted the museum in Rewa fort after killing the guard Kamla Prasad, and had escaped with several antiques.

SP Kannauj said the antiques dated back to 500 years.

“Banjara and his aides had decamped with a pen pistol of year 1911 which was purchased by Raja Gulab Singh, a 40 kg silver chattri (umbrella), six antique swords, a silver ornamented hukkah, ornamental dresses and fabrics used to deck up elephants on special occasions, two antique pistols, silver and gold wedding dresses, one gold and three silver lamps,” said police.

A country-made pistol of .315 bore and several live catridges were seized from his possession on Sunday.

Jehanabad SP Manish said a police team led by deputy superintendent of police Ashok Kumar Pandey has been deployed at the village to avoid any untoward incident. A case under Section 302 (murder) has been lodged against the owner of the house and a few others on the statement of the deceased’s kin.

The incident took place around 11pm on Saturday when Lalbabu allegedly barged into the house of Sudama Kewat at the village. Sudama along with others brutally assaulted the youth on the suspicion of being a thief, causing grievous injuries to him.

Police rushed to the village and rescued the victim from the mob fury. He was admitted to the primary health centre at Ghosi from where he was later referred to the sadar hospital at Jehanabad, where he succumbed to his injuries on Sunday.

SHO of Ghosi police station Dheeraj Kumar said the victim’s father, Kaushalendra Prasad, told police that his son was mentally challenged. “Yet, Kewat and his associates held him captive and thrashed him,” the SHO quoted the Kaushalendra as saying.

The SHO said Lalu was earlier sent to jail in a theft case lodged with the Kako police station in the district. “Two separate FIRs have been lodged in connection with the incident. While the first FIR is related to attempted theft in the house of Kewat, the second FIR deals with brutal assault on the youth, leading to his death,” he added.

The SP said it was being ascertained whether the deceased was undergoing treatment for his ailment or not. “I have asked the SHO to probe the case from all angles,” he added.

According to VC Prof Rajendra Prasad, the course will be introduced from the academic session 2020-21 itself. The two years masters course, under the choice-based credit system will have four semesters. “To begin with, the annual intake has been fixed at 60,” said the VC.

Asked whether the course will be also introduced in colleges imparting PG education, the VC said teaching in information technology will be conducted only at the headquarters-based PG centre. Before any expansionary move, it is essential to have quality education at one centre in the field of IT. “The course will go a long way in improving the university’s academic profile,” said Prof Rajendra Prasad.

Asked about the proposed course in defence studies, the VC said the Raj Bhavan is yet to give the go ahead signal. Without the Raj Bhavan’s approval, the new course cannot be introduced. The Chancellor’s office earlier cleared the proposal for introduction of PG teaching in information technology.

Regarding conducting of pending university exams, the VC said, “A decision will be taken at the end of the ongoing lockdown. The lockdown is scheduled to end on July 31. The university office remains closed during the lockdown period and the employees have been directed to remain present at the headquarters for short notice summons.”

Earlier, the university had postponed the PG and UG exams scheduled to begin on July 3 and 16 respectively. Asked whether the exams will be held in the conventional pen-paper mode, the VC said that innovative methods of assessment are required to regularise the academic calendar of the university and clear the exam backlog. The academic calendar cannot be easily regularised in the pen-paper mode exam. “My first priority is to bring the academic calendar back on the rails and clear the exam back log,” the VC added.

Dr Sunil said a delegation of doctors comprising IMA state president Dr Bimal Kumar Karak, president-elect Dr Amar Kant Jha Amar and former president Dr Sahjanand met the health minister on Friday and submitted a letter in this regard. The letter addressed to the chief minister was sent to his office with a copy to the chief secretary as well.

The IMA, in its letter, said some unnecessary actions taken by the DMs of Bhojpur and Gopalganj led to frustration and discouragement among the doctors, who were fighting the pandemic with all sincerity in the two districts.

Dr Amar told this newspaper that the delegation, in its meeting with health minister, urged him to expedite the process of posting of 1,100 doctors appointed recently in all medical colleges and district hospitals. The IMA also demanded immediate appointment of general doctors against the existing 4,000 vacancies. Amar said the minister assured the delegation to act positively and expeditiously so as to further strengthen the medical force in this trying times of Covid 19 pandemic.

The IMA also urged the state government to reserve 25% beds in corona-dedicated hospitals for treatment of doctors getting infected. It said similar provisions have already been made for officers of the administrative and police services.

Dr Amar said another important decision taken by the IMA was to offer free consultation by its members across the state to plasma donors and their family members for one year in order to motivate others for this noble cause. Plasma donation would help save many lives, he added.

41,['27/07/2020'],Bihar: Six cops among 18 hurt in clash over burning of funeral pyre,"Representative image

PATNA: Police had to open fire in air to quell a mob indulged in stone pelting and firing following a violent clash over burning of a funeral pyre in Aurangabad district on Sunday. At least six police personnel, including a circle inspector and a station house officer, were injured in the stone pelting.

The injured cops are undergoing treatment at the referral hospital at Amba. Earlier, 12 people from two rival groups were injured in the clash. Police have so far detained six people for attacking cops and obstructing them from discharging duty.

Trouble started around 8am when some residents of Kasauti village reached a pond on the outskirts of neighbouring Bharat village with the body of a woman, who had died on Saturday night. As the kin of the woman was about to lit the pyre, a group of people rushed to the cremation site and stopped them. This led to a clash between the residents of Kasauti and Bharat villages in which 12 people were injured.

On getting information, police teams from Amba and Kutumba police stations reached the spot and tried to bring the situation under control. However, the villagers started pelting the police personnel with stones, causing head injuries to circle inspector Satish Kumar, SHO of Amba police station Birendra Paswan and four more cops.

Aurangabad SP (incharge) Pankaj Kumar said police fired three rounds in the air to disperse the violent mob. “Nobody was injured in the police firing. A police team led by Aurangabad deputy superintendent of police Anup Kumar is camping at the village. The pyre of the woman was lit under the supervision of circle officer Anil Kumar,” the SP added.

Mithilesh Paswan, a local, said they have been burning the pyre at the village pond for long, but never witnessed any protest from the residents of Bharat village earlier.

42,['27/07/2020'],"TikTok clones from India, China and US fill the void","(Representative image)

BENGALURU: Three weeks after the TikTok ban, homegrown short-video app Roposo, owned by InMobi, has shown the highest growth of almost 142% in new downloads in the race to fill the gap after the ban of the ByteDance-owned platform.

Interestingly, the other top two apps in the same space are from China ( Zili by Xiaomi) and the US ( Dubsmash ) respectively, indicating the TikTok replacement is not entirely by local apps. This is based on data from SensorTower, which compared the growth of these apps during the three weeks before the ban of 59 Chinese apps and then three weeks after.

Overall, these three apps saw a growth of 155% in new downloads after the TikTok ban. This comes at a time when multiple local apps like Chingari and Trell have seen good growth and are trying to emulate TikTok in India. Among the 59 Chinese apps banned here last month, TikTok was the largest one in terms of number of users, which stood at about 200 million with 120 million of them monthly active users.

Since the ban, Roposo, Zili, and Dubsmash together have garnered close to 22 million downloads, around 13% of TikTok’s installs in India in the first six months of 2020, according to SensorTower. Owing to recent geopolitical developments, the government has banned 59 apps, which also includes e-tailer Club Factory.

In the three weeks to July 19, Roposo saw over 13 million downloads, while Zili was installed almost 8 million times, followed by over 6-lakh installs for Dubsmash. In terms of all-time installs, Roposo now has 71 million installs, while Zili has 51 million, and Dubsmash has over 30 million.

This data, which includes Google and Apple app stores, also indicates high competition for Indian platforms, whether from US platforms or Chinese rivals that are not banned in India. The government has, since the ban, urged local developers to build more apps.

VADODARA: Every year with approaching monsoon, farmer from Haripura Vasediya village in Chhota Udepur district, Shivji Rathwa, goes shopping in Naswadi town to buy fertilizer with money he saved throughout the year.

This year too, Rathwa went ‘monsoon’ shopping to Naswadi town, but returned home with an old television and a dish and set-top box for satellite TV instead. Not that the Rathwas were keen on entertainment. But because the father wanted to sow in his daughter’s good education this time. Rathwa had been noticing his daughter Hetal, a Class XII student, help her mother daily with household work than do her online lessons.

But living in a village, where mobile connectivity was terribly poor forcing people either to run up on terraces or even a nearby hillock to talk over phone, learning through online classes was a distant dream.

Rathwa then learned that home learning classes are also broadcast on the state-run Doordarshan Girnar channel and so he got an old broken television and DTH set from his relative. “This is a crucial year for her so even if little, she will now be able to learn something,” Rathwa told TOI.

He spent over Rs 3,100 to purchase the DTH set and also repair the defunct TV.

In the afternoons now, Hetal studiously sits in front of the television and attends to the hour-long class, after which she returns to help her mother. But the TV is not switched off. Reason? Other girl students from the village come to Rathwa’s house for their studies.

When asked how will he manage without fertilizer, the proud father replied quickly: “I will manage somehow. The sowing season has just begun so I will borrow from my friends in the village.”

“There are around two dozen students in the village who will take board exams this year. Earlier in our village rarely anyone studied beyond Class X, but now parents have become aware and encourage their kids for studies,” said Dhirendra Rathwa, a resident of the same village.

The village has a school but only till Class V. Most of the students have to go to the model residential schools at Tanakhla, Puniyavant, Linda among others.

“Not every parent can buy a TV. Installing a tower for mobile network would be expensive, but if the government can install a large TV and DTH set in a community hall of the village all students can benefit and they would not have to drop out of their studies,” Rathwa added wistfully.

45,['27/07/2020'],India’s e-commerce penetration will double to 11% by 2024: Goldman Sachs,"(Representative image)

BENGALURU: India’s e-commerce industry is expected to reach $99 billion in size when online commerce penetration will more than double to almost 11%. The growth rate for the industry in India, for each of the next four years, would surpass the same of established economies like the US, China, the UK, Europe and Brazil, according to Goldman Sachs ’s review of e-commerce markets globally.

E-commerce is expected to register a growth of over 18% for the current year but estimates for 2021 and 2022 show a year-on-year growth rate of over 33% and 28% respectively. To compare, growth rates for the same period for the US are 17% and 19%, while it is nearly 11% for China in the next two years. To be sure, the market size base is bigger in both the US and China along with higher penetration of the total retail market. The pandemic is accelerating both growth and penetration of e-commerce further in these markets, including in India.

At a recent industry seminar, Prashant Prakash, partner at venture capital firm Accel , which was one of the early-backers of Flipkart , said it took a decade for India to see e-commerce penetration of around 3% and that it has quickly moved to 5%. This is further seen in the bullishness shown by both Amazon India and Walmart here. Amazon has committed an additional $1 billion investment for India while Walmart said it will invest $1.2 billion in Flipkart.

Among the sectors highlighted for e-commerce in India, the report estimated online grocery to be the biggest incremental growth driver for e-commerce with the segment expected to grow 20 times in India over five years to be of $29 billion in size (currently under $2 billion).

While smartphones, electronics, large appliances have relatively higher online penetration, there is significant room for growth in categories like apparel, appliances, health & personal care, compared to economies like China, it added.

“The category has been growing at more than 50% year-on-year for the last couple of years, but with the outbreak of Covid-19 resulting in a shift to online, and the recent entry of RIL, we believe growth will accelerate to 81% annual growth rate for the period of 2019-2024,” analysts at Goldman Sachs said. While Bigbasket and Grofers held more than 80% market share in the online grocery last year, it estimates RIL (via JioMart ) could end with 50% market share by 2024 but there will be space for two or more large players to exist in a large market like grocery.

If you feel that excitement and passion are missing in your relationship, you might go on dreaming about it with someone else.Another big reason could also be because you might have a harmless crush on someone else. This could also lead to cheating dreams.It could mean that there's a third wheel in your relationship that's affecting you in unknown ways. You aren't particularly jealous or insecure in real, but the thought of your partner spending time or being close friends with someone else might affect you deeply and result in such dreams.Another major reason could be because you don't trust your partner.

However, it was closed on the two lockdown days this week.“We had to walk past the pavement where the used PPE was dumped, somewhere between Bengal Rowing Club and Lake Club,” said Probir Kumar Das, former director of NIT and a morning walker.Environmentalist S M Ghosh said, “KMDA recently stopped single-scull rowing inside Rabindra Sarobar citing the need to arrest the spread of the virus. And this morning, right after the lockdown, we found people playing football, crowding the place and washing themselves in the lake, without wearing masks or following social distancing norms. And then we found used PPE on the pavement.”Arun Agarwal, who has been taking walks in the morning for four decades, said, “I am diabetic and 70 years old. I was so happy when the Lake reopened for us for three hours. But after today, I don’t think I can come here for morning walks. The football match started at 6am and continued till 8am. We couldn’t do our walking or exercises because these people were all over the place, sitting and strolling on the tracks used for jogging and walking. Nobody was wearing a mask.”Another morning walker, retired teacher Saroma Mukherjee, complained to the security guards against the football players. “It was of no use. The guards just stood and watched the violations. I am not sure I will come for morning walks from tomorrow. It’s too dangerous when Covid is rapidly spreading and the authorities are unable to take steps to implement safety protocol. KMDA must consider these as grave issues and identify the culprits without delay,” she said.A KMDA official looking after Rabindra Sarobar said, “The PPE could have been used by frontline workers in a local clinic. KMC is supposed to ensure that PPE kits are not dumped in the open. But we are trying to make sure that football is not played on the premises.”",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77189329,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-192314,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/discarded-ppe-unmasked-players-shock-lake-walkers/articleshow/77187845.cms
50,['27/07/2020'],Gaya: Shortage of frontline workers hits anti-Covid fight,"GAYA: With more than 75% of the sanctioned post of doctors lying vacant, Gaya ’s fight against Covid has got somewhat weakened.As against the sanctioned strength of 422 government doctors in a district with an estimated population of 50 lakh (43 lakh as per the 2011 census), the total number of doctors is now 98. The posts are lying vacant for several years.As against 212 posts of specialists in the district, the working strength is only 41. In respect of specialists, the vacancy comes to more than 80% of the sanctioned strength. Not only that, as against the sanctioned strength of 210 general physicians, the working strength is only 57. Conceding that the shortage of doctors adversely affected the anti-Covid fight, civil surgeon Dr BK Singh said the available resources are being put to optimum use.Services of 114 Ayush doctors are also being used. “But Ayush doctors have their own limitations in dealing with the pandemic,” said the civil surgeon.According to activist Baliram Sharma, shortage of doctors affects the war against Covid in more than one way. Besides less manpower, the shortage also means that even in case of dereliction of duty by working doctors, the authorities can do little as actions like suspension will further deplete the strength and as such working doctors, in a way can get away with their acts of omission and commission.According to a serving doctor preferring anonymity, he will not mind being suspended during this pandemic as he will then be spared of the taxing schedule and risks involved in dealing with Covid cases. Asked about the vacancy in the paramedical category , the civil surgeon said that he was not in a position to give details off hand but a sizeable number of posts are vacant even in this category as well.Dr Harichand Hari, superintendent, Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College Hospital (ANMMCH), also said that staff shortage is being felt. More than half-a-dozen ANMMCH doctors earlier tested Covid positive. Several paramedical staff of the hospital including those working in the virological lab too, tested positive.Meanwhile, an additional isolation facility is being created in the district to accommodate as many Covid positive cases as possible. Besides the existing isolation beds in ANMMCH, sub-divisional hospitals at Tekari and Sherghati and APHC, Mahkar (home village of ex-CM Jitan Ram Manjhi), a 50-bed Isolation centre has been established at the Indoor Stadium located in Gaya Gandhi Maidan.According to district magistrate Abhishek Singh, a 60-bed Covid care centre is also being set up at Nizamia Unani Medical College Hospital near Belaganj.",patna,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77189559,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-286113,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/shortage-of-frontline-workers-hits-anti-covid-fight/articleshow/77186648.cms
51,['27/07/2020'],Aditya Puri HDFC Shares: Aditya Puri sells HDFC Bank shares worth Rs 843 crore,"MUMBAI: Aditya Puri , HDFC Bank’s managing director who’s slotted to retire in about three months, last week sold about 74 lakh shares of the bank worth about Rs 843 crore, exchange disclosures showed. This is the second instance of Puri selling HDFC Bank shares this year. Between February 11 and February 12, Puri had sold 12.5 lakh shares of the bank for about Rs 156 crore.Puri, who quit his job as head of Citibank Malaysia to launch HDFC Bank in 1994, has created the country’s second-largest lender and most valuable bank with a market cap of about Rs 6 lakh crore. Under his leadership, the bank has given 20% growth with a consistency that analysts began to describe as “boring”. The bank is now the third most valued listed entity in India, behind Reliance Industries (Rs 14 lakh crore) and TCS (Rs 8 lakh crore).Puri had 0.14% of the bank’s equity. After the offloading, which was equivalent to 0.13%, he is left with 0.01% stake, currently worth Rs 43 crore (about 3.8 lakh shares), according to BSE disclosure.According to the bank’s filing with the BSE so far this month, 39 of HDFC Bank’s executives who are designated ‘insiders’ under Sebi rules, have sold the bank’s shares aggregating Rs 884 crore. This includes sales by Puri and Ashok Khanna , who recently quit as the head of the lender’s auto loan business.Market analysts and fund managers around the world usually keep a close watch on insider transactions, for a cue about the future course of the business of the entity and its stock price. Generally, it is believed that insider selling indicates a likely slide in the stock price while insider buying points to a spurt in stock price. From falling to a year-low level of Rs 739 on March 23, so far HDFC Bank’s stock price has rallied 53% to its current close at Rs 1,131 on the BSE.On Sunday, HDFC Bank said that the shares that Puri sold were allotted to him “at different times and at different price points” and were not allotted at par. “Therefore, the net amount realized by Puri is not Rs 843 crore as stated. The acquisition cost of shares and the tax payable on the transaction has to be accounted for,” it said.After being set up in mid-1994, HDFC Bank went public in 1996. In the last 20 years, for which data is available, the bank’s market cap has grown from about Rs 5,400 crore at the start of the millennium to its current level of above Rs 6 lakh crore: That’s a growth of over 112 times in two decades. Seen another way, an investment of Rs 1 lakh in the bank’s shares on January 1, 2000, would be worth a little over Rs 1 crore now. In addition, the bank has also paid dividends over this period, which is outside of the stock return.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77189168,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-61679,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/puri-sells-hdfc-bank-shares-worth-rs-843cr/articleshow/77188315.cms
52,['27/07/2020'],Some see golden chance to settle loan,"(With inputs from Rajesh Chandramouli)

CHENNAI: A record-high price is giving an opportunity for gold loan borrowers to sell off their pledged gold and settle the loan or opt for a foreclosure and borrow more for the same gram of gold.According to RBI regulations, up to 75% of the value of the gold can be lent. Rising gold prices have meant that loan-to-value (LTV) is higher by Rs 500 per gram on the same jewellery. Private gilt lender Manappuram Finance MD & CEO V P Nandakumar said, “It is true that we have been seeing a new trend of gold loan customers settling their pledges in order to sell the gold in the scrap market and take advantage of the prevailing high gold price. This trend was at its peak in May, when the lockdown was lifted and branches reopened, and it is gradually coming down over the past two months.”“Before the lockdown, the LTV stood at Rs 2,850 per gram and currently it stands at Rs 3,350 per gram of 22 carat gold,” Nandakumar said.A good part of the quarter was lost to lockdowns, and with public transport not functioning in most parts, customer footfalls at the branches were low. Therefore, the growth came mostly from existing customers who benefited from the increased LTV driven by increased gold prices. Customers have made use of our digital channels to increase their borrowings against their existing pledges.An official from City Union Bank said “With the gold price skyrocketing, we see our customers rushing to close their existing gold loans, by which they could borrow at higher against the same gold (jewellery). After deducting the interest, customers will get Rs 5,000 more for every one sovereign of gold (8 gram).”Karur Vysya Bank has seen gold loan borrowings against the already pledged jewellery go up by 15%-20%. “We do see borrowers keen to take advantage of this rise in gold price, especially with higher demand from farmers in the delta region. However, we have not made any revision on the LTV, as we do not know when the price would crash.”While many lenders are treading cautiously, the cushion appears the easy liquidity of gold. “Normally, it’s a 3-month loan fully asset-backed. While people say prices have reached speculative orbit, some analysts are still bullish. We are seeing many customers sell their pledged gold,” said Y S Chakravarthy, MD & CEO of Shriram City Union Finance.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77197349,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-146233,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/some-see-golden-chance-to-settle-loan/articleshow/77187517.cms
53,['27/07/2020'],Psychologists step in to stem virus fear,"Vijayawada: After pulmonologists and core health care workers, psychologists and psychiatrists are playing a significant role in handling the Covid-19 pandemic. The outbreak of the infection has had a psychosocial impact by causing mass hysteria, economic burden and financial losses. The disease has also generated a plethora of psychiatric manifestations across different strata of society. The Krishna district administration along with Andhra Pradesh Psychologists’ Association (APPA), hence, has started free phone consultations for Covid-19 patients

Around 1,200 people are utilising the helpline per day, on average. Speaking to TOI, Dr TS Rao, rehabilitation psychologist and president of APPA said Covid-19 has had a psychological impact on people of all ages “We have been going to Covid-19 centres and interacting with patients. Most are scared and unable to think positively. Not all Covid-19 patients will die and only three per cent of them are put on ventilators. We are explaining this and motivating them. I have seen many cases of Covid-19 patients who don’t have any symptoms, but complications arose due to stress,” he said.

Rao added that most people who call seek guidance after their neighbour or relative tests positive. Proper guidance and counselling are needed for these people so that they can overcome the fear, he said. A team of psychologists, including APPA vice president Dr Garre Shankar Rao, is conducting the phone counselling sessions.

Krishna district collector A Mohammed Imtiaz said, “We are happy with the response from the public. Psychological strength is much needed to win over Covid-19. The APPA and its team are continuously counseling patients every day and have helped 5,700 patients till date,” Imtiaz said.

54,['27/07/2020'],Cyber frauds use QR code to cheat,"Picture for representational purpose only.

HYDERABAD: Fraudsters have found a new way of cheating people on e-commerce websites. While earlier people instances of people getting conned while buying products have come to the light, the crooks have also started looting people while one tries to sell something.

In one such instance, a 31-year-old private employee from Chikadpally was trying to sell a sofa set for Rs 7,000 on social media. “I received a call from a person who was interested in purchasing the product. He negotiated the price and later agreed to pay Rs 6,000 and said will transfer the amount to my Paytm account,” said the complaint.

The fraudsters sent a QR code asking the peroson to scan it for receiving the payment. Believing him, the victim entered the PIN of his digital payment app and lost close to Rs 92,000.

The crooks are also shopkeepers pretending to buy their products in bulk. In one incident, a shopkeeper from the IT corridor received a request for delivery of 20 litres of Hydraulic Oil over a phone call. The person on the other end agreed to pay Rs 21,000. The fraudster then requested for the phone number that the shopkeeper used for UPI application and sent the QR code through WhatsApp .

“Believing the offender, the victim did not notice it was a request for paying the amount instead of receiving and lost Rs 56,000,” said a police officer from the cybercrime cell.

With close to eight such instances reported, police officials have advised citizens to be cautious while making payments through QR Codes . “Do not scan QR code sent by unknown persons without verifying. Check before entering the PIN, whether the request has been made for receiving the amount or making a payment. People are also advised to use e-wallets only after one is fully aware of all the functions,” said the officer.

Presently, on Sundays shops are not permitted to open in the state due to weekend lockdown. During an FB live session on Saturday the CM had said that he had accepted the request of sweet shop owners to keep the shops open on August 2 for the convenience of the people of the state , but social distancing and other norms would have to be followed by the shop owners as well as the people.

Recently, the sweet shop owners of Ludhiana and Punjab had met cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and sent their demand through him to the CM. Reacting to the decision, Narinder Pal Singh, state president of the Halwai Association, said, “We are already facing huge problems due to the coronavirus pandemic as our sales have crashed. Moreover, the Sunday ban has worked like a nail in our coffin as it was the only day of the week when majority of sales used to take place earlier. As the festival of Rakhi is on August 3 and it being Monday , the customers would want to buy the sweets a day earlier to avoid the rush but since August 2 is Sunday it will not be possible for us to open the shops. Therefore we requested cabinet minister Ashu to allow us to open the shops on Sunday.”

According to Charanjit Singh , president of Halwai Association, Ludhiana, “We will take full responsibility of cleanliness and hygiene in our shops and also ensure that no crowds are built inside the shops. We request public as well to follow all norms and visit the shops with masks and obey the timings of operation of shops as well.”

56,['27/07/2020'],Police’s timely response prevents suicides,"When a woman jumped into a canal in Thumba, CISF men dived and pulled out her to safety

Thiruvananthapuram: The world is passing through a period where people who do not adhere to social-distancing norms are criticised for their foolishness, or even worse, booked by police for putting others and their own lives at risk. But not all those who threw caution to the wind are foolish and they deserve criticism.

Some even win hearts by doing so. Like civil police officer Rasheed Jalaludeen , who was on duty in a containment zone at Vizhinjam . Jalaludeen did not hesitate to save an unknown woman who was attempting suicide by jumping into the sea. Jalaludeen’s act has won praises from the city residents and on Sunday, the city police authorities decided to reward him through an appreciation letter.

It was on Friday afternoon, Jalaludeen risked his own life to save the woman.

“It was around 1.30 pm and I was on bike-patrolling duty,’’ said Jalaludeen, who is attached to Vizhinjam police station. He was about to take a break and have lunch when a woman rushed to him raising alarm over another woman whose actions evoked suspicion. The woman told the officer that the other woman, who rode a scooter, stopped by to ask direction towards Azhimala temple. When she told her that the temple was closed at that time, she asked her whether it was possible to access the beach behind the temple through its compound.

Hearing this, Jalaludeen immediately passed an alert to the local station and rushed to the beach. When he spotted the woman, she was trying to scale the rocky cliff near the beach in a bid to jump. When he tried to speak to her, she even threw her phone at him. But the police officer managed to get hold of her and prevent her from jumping.

Just a week ago, there was a similar incident at Thumba. This happened on July 18 at Stationkadavu under Thumba police station limits. A group of three constables of Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) on security duty at Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) here and a 27-year-old woman ailing from mental issues were the central characters in that episode. Her husband, who recently returned from Gulf after losing job owing to Covid, said she was under treatment for mental ailment and had displayed suicide tendencies in the past too.

The woman jumped into the canal from a bridge in front of the main gate of VSSC. Constables B Balanaik, B Narasmhalu and D Sampath, who witnessed the woman’s attempt, acted swiftly and dived into the canal after her. Though they suffered minor injuries in the event, they were able to pull out the woman to safety before she drowned. She was taken to a hospital and was discharged after first-aid care on the same day.

Local people informed about the cannonball to S Babu, a researcher on fine arts of Tamil. He went to the spot and carried out a survey of the place. The cannonball dates back to 17th century, said Babu after analysing the stone. “Britishers used stone cannonballs to break open forts during wars. Such cannonballs were later used by Indian rulers also, says archaeologist C Santhalingam from Pandia Nadu Centre for Historical Research from Madurai.

While stone cannonballs were found in a few places in the region, this one is rare for its inscribed Tamil letter, he said. He said the letters appears to be old going by its shape, which could be dates back to the time between 17th and 18th century. The letter may denote a place or the name of an individual, further exploration at the place could reveal more details, he said.

Babu said that archaeological remains estimated to be of early Chola period were found in the village a few years ago. Pieces of earthen pot called Mudhumakkal Thazhi used by ancient people to bury elders after their death were found.

AHMEDABAD: A Satellite-based businessman driving his sedan was stopped by a motorcycle-borne man who abused him, put a knife on his car’s bonnet, snatched away his car keys and drove away the car. This happened at around 9.30 pm on Saturday in Nehrunagar area of the city just a kilometre away from a police bundobust point at Nehtrunagar Circle when police were patrolling.

In his FIR with Ellisbridge police, Sujan Shah, 47, resident of Paritosh Bungalows in Satellite who runs a furniture business in Lambha, stated that the incident occurred when he was going towards Gulbai Tekra.

“I was driving my car towards Gulbai Tekra to bring my son from my sister-in-law’s place. When I was near Navyug Society in a lane beside SBI, a man riding a motorcycle drove parallel to me and waived his hand asking me to stop my car,” Shah states in the FIR.

Shah added that as he stopped his car, the man put his motorcycle in front of his car. He then began talking with Shah aggressively and put a knife on his car’s bonnet.

“The man, who was aged around 20 and 25, threatened to kill me and he said that he is a local goon of Vejalpur. At that time, another man also came there and asked him why he was abusing me. But the accused abused the man too, so he fled,” states Shah in the FIR.

Then, the accused started Shah’s car and drove away while leaving behind his motorcycle.

Shah approached Ellisbridge police and filed a complaint of robbery and criminal intimidation against the unknown man.

60,['27/07/2020'],‘Councillors should limit meeting people to check its spread’,"The first citizen of Ludhiana, mayor Balkar Sandhu, has remained at the front while encouraging frontline warriors of the civic body in fighting Covid-19. Despite being a heart patient, the mayor did not step back from his responsibilities towards the city and tried providing best facilities to the residents. Though he admitted that coronavirus cases are increasing and everybody needs to take preventive measures, he claimed that efforts were going on to control its spread so that it should not reach community spread stage. Here are a few excerpts from a conversation between TOI correspondent Nidhi Bhardwaj and the mayor.

Q) A large number of Covid cases are being reported from the city. Where did we make a mistake in keeping a check on its spread?

A) No doubt, the number of cases are increasing on a fast pace in the city. But it does not mean the state government or us have made any mistake in controlling the spreading of Covid-19. Punjab was the first state to impose lockdown after which other states and the central government took the step. The chief minister Amarinder Singh took stringent measures to curb the spread of the disease. But even then it is rising. It is spreading in the entire country but even then we can still control it. The Ludhiana MC started sanitisation in the state in the first stage and then other districts followed and did it in their respective cities.

Q) Coronavirus has infected the officials and now even the councillors are Covid positive. Whether there are any plans to get all the councillors tested because they have to do maximum public dealing ?

A) Precaution is the only prevention from this disease and instead of meeting too many people the councillors should fix the limit for remaining in public. I am also one of the councillors and do public dealing every morning and then I have to go to the MC offices as well. But since the cases started growing gradually, I have made a schedule to visit MC offices on alternate days and even in my ward I maintain social distancing. As far as councillors testing is concerned, for this we will have to seek permission from the state government. The councillors who have doubts should definitely get themselves tested.

Q) For limiting contact among the staff at MC offices and public some steps were taken by the civic body. But residents seem to be unhappy with those arrangements and continue visiting the officials. Why?

A) The day we had decided to curb public dealing with staff I had instructed the cops deployed in zones not to allow any individual to meet any employee or staff member directly. The complaint boxes are kept at all zonal offices. These complaints are being traced properly but people I think do not get satisfaction unless they hand over the letters or documents in the hands of concerned officer. We have made arrangements and now it is up to the public for helping us in fulfilling the target for which we have taken this step.

Q) Why can’t all complaints be addressed through online redress system?

A) For addressing the public complaints where we have arranged the complaint boxes, we have also issued helpline numbers and email IDs of senior officers. These officials are keeping track of these complaints and on complaint helplines employees are told to trace the complaint and inform the complainant as well. Moreover, even for flood control rooms we have advertise on boards for public awareness. For every service being given by MC there are helpline numbers. We can only provide the facility, now it is up to public whether they want to opt it or not.

Q) How can residents keep track of the status of their complaints?

A) The complaints are coming through various sources as we have emails, mobile applications, manual complaint system and telephones. The staff deputed for noting down the complaints first keep record of complaint, they reach out to the officer concerned for solving the issue and then they call up the complainant whether the complaint was resolved and if it is not done they again ask the officer. The residents can check status of their complaints if they have done it online, while for telephonic complaints employees contact them. Mostly complaints come through councillors and people keep on asking their councillors unless it is resolved.

Q) How is the MC coordinating with the health department in tracking the suspects cases and contacts of the affected residents?

A) We are working in coordination with the health department and whenever there is any instruction from the civil surgeon office the officers act immediately. The officials are deputed to manage facilities in quarantine centres and whenever any area is declared containment or micro-containment zone the teams go for sanitisation, which is going on in affected areas and we have stocks to handle the situation. There will be no shortage of any kind.

Q) Does Ludhiana have any action plan to deal with the eventuality of a community spread?

A) We will act as per the directions of the state government and health department. If any such situation takes place, Ludhiana MC is always ready to give fight with whatever resources we have. We provided ration to the public, transported the migrants to railway station, sanitisation was done properly in all wards of the city, so in future too our efforts will be going on.

Q) What are the future plans of civic body to continue with working during coronavirus?

A) The working will go on as per the situation in the city. Since cases are increasing, so public dealing will be minimum. But one thing I have made clear to the staff that there will be no compromise with sanitation and other civic amenities for the residents. In the coming days we will distribute chlorine tablets among councillors for distributing those in slum areas, where people cannot afford RO system or purifiers because during rainy season water contamination troubles a lot.

Q) Being first citizen of Ludhiana you have been seen without mask several times at public places. Don’t you think it spreads wrong message among public?

A) I do not move out in public without mask. I have kept masks ready in my car and whenever I move out I wear those.

According to Shamshabad police, Boinpally Venugopal was a private employee from Ayyavaripally village of Shadnagar mandal. “The victim wore a helmet but did not strap it. As a result, the moment he fell the helmet came off,” said Shamshabad ACP, Ashok Kumar Goud.

According to the official, CCTV footage from near the accident spot revealed a Swift Dzire being driven negligently before it rammed Venugopal’s Hero Glamour bike. Both the vehicles were travelling in the same direction.

“The number plate is not clearly visible. We are investigating,” said the ACP. A case was registered under section 304-A (causing death by negligence) and 337 (whoever causes hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life or the personal safety of others) of IPC.

63,['27/07/2020'],Kodai traders continue shutdown for fourth day,"Madurai: The traders in Kodaikanal town and nearby areas are following the one-week self-imposed lockdown strictly as all the shops remain closed for the fourth day on Sunday.

The decision to shut down shops was taken at a meeting convened by Kodaikanal revenue department led by revenue divisional officer Sivakumar on July 21. It was decided to close all the shops except milk booths and medical stores between July 23 and July 29. People from various spheres including traders and social activists took part in the meeting.

The president of Kodaikanal Chamber of Commerce, S N S Raja, said that the decision was taken after consulting all the people who took part in the meeting. Although a section of traders suggested a 15-day lockdown, the majority wanted a shorter one so that shops can be opened before the upcoming Bakrid festival.

“There has been a good response for the closure as every trader has extended support by closing the shop,” he said.

A revenue official said that Kodaikanal reported its first Covid-19 case only in the first week of June. Only a few cases were reported in June, but the number started increasing in the last few weeks. The total number of Covid-19 cases is nearing 150 in Kodaikanal and there are around 100 active cases now.

The officials said although the situation is not alarming, traders took the decision without any force from officials. With the shops completely closed, people’s movement has come down drastically. It will help bring down Covid-19 spread, he said. “The shutdown is completely voluntary and no action can be taken against a trader, if he chooses to open the shop,” the official said.

She has accused her husband Kuldeep Rana, mother-in-law Nanniben Rana and father-in-law Roopsinh Rana, all based at Khokhra, of harassing her mentally and physically.

Khokhra police have lodged a complaint under Sections 498 (A), 323, 294 (b) and 114 against the accused. Inspector Y S Gamit of Khokhra police station said they are probing the case and verifying the details of the FIR.

Sapna stated in the FIR that she was wed to Kuldeep Rana about four years ago. A month ago she gave birth to a girl child. Her husband’s parents live nearby.

“The complainant has alleged that on Friday at about 11pm in the night, when she’d asked her husband to arrange for the birth certificate of the baby girl, her husband started beating her. Hearing her cries of help her parents-in-law rushed in, but they too took the side of her husband and began abusing her.

“The complainant then called the police control room and filed the complaint,” Gamit said.

The FIR states that about two and a half years ago her husband had driven Sapna out of the house, and she returned only after her parents sent her back.

“She has alleged that her husband and in-laws were torturing her for giving birth to a girl child as they’d wanted a boy,” said a police official.

The complainant stated that initially she was treated well by her in-laws, but as time went by her husband started torturing her over cooking and other issues.

67,['27/07/2020'],Kerala: Forest department to arrest gold smuggling ‘kingpin’ K T Ramees,"KOCHI: Even as the National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) is set to question former secretary to the CM and IAS officer M Sivasankar on Monday again in connection with the gold smuggling case, the noose is tightening around the mastermind of the operation, K T Ramees , as various agencies are checking his antecedents as well.

Ramees is presently in the custody of the Commissionerate of Customs (Preventive) (CCP) which arrested him. His custody period is set to end on Monday and sources say CCP is likely to seek an extension of his custody so that he can be questioned along with two other accused, Swapna Suresh and Sandeep Nair, who customs intend to seek in custody as well.

But it is not just the customs department that needs Ramees in custody, sources with the Kerala forest department on Sunday said they would soon record the formal arrest of Ramees in a case in which he has been accused of instigating locals to hunt wild animals and selling the meat.

“He was in a Covid care centre and later in the custody of customs. Once he is back in judicial custody, we would record his arrest and seek him in custody,” said a forest officer.

NIA, meanwhile in its remand reports filed in the case, has been hinting at investigating Ramees’s unlawful activities. In the report filed on Friday, NIA cites the statements of Swapna and Sandeep to state that Ramees was a kingpin in the case.

“A-4 (Sandeep) had also stated about the suspected unlawful activities of Ramees which will affect the security of the nation,” it said.

An earlier remand report mentions the statement of the accused that Ramees insisted on smuggling gold in large quantities and maximum numbers during the lockdown period ‘as the financial position of the country is weak’. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) too is probing the activities of Ramees. ED had filed a case information report on July 13 against Ramees, as well as others.

NEW DELHI: The probe into the hit-and-run case of ACP Sanket Kaushik , which took place near Rajokri flyover late of Saturday, has revealed that the mini-truck driver who crushed the senior police officer against a movable road divider had stopped to check for damages to his vehicle.

The trucker drove off when Kaushik’s driver, Munni Lal, ran towards him. In his statement, Lal said that the accused was not wearing a mask and the numberplate of the mini-truck was smeared with mud. An FIR was registered on the basis of Lal’s statement.

Kaushik’s family members have asked police to probe foul play in the case. “There are few CCTV cameras near the crime spot. Though it seems to be a hit-and-run case, we have requested for a thorough probe owing to the circumstances under which the incident took place. We are waiting for the vehicle to be identified,” said a relative.

On Sunday, Kaushik was given full honours by Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava and senior officers at the traffic police headquarters in Todapur. He will also be declared a martyr for laying down his life in the line of duty.

Munni Lal told police that Kaushik was walking on the right side of the service lane, a few metres ahead of his staff members, when the truck coming from Gurgaon side hit him from behind. The officer was hurled onto the movable divider and crushed by the truck. “I raised an alarm and shouted at the driver to stop, but he just looked back at me and sped off,” Lal said, adding he remembered the driver’s face.

Police have recovered some metal angles that had fallen off the truck, which would be used as evidence. The area where the incident took place didn’t have CCTV coverage. There were two cameras in the service lane, but the numberplate of the truck was not visible due to lack of streetlights. Police are scanning through footage of cameras installed on Dwarka Link Road, NH-48 till Dhaula Kuan, Outer Ring Road and Vasant Kunj to identify the truck. There has been no headway in the case so far.

They include a 25-year-old university student, a 31-year-old professional and a 53-year old housemaker, informed Dr Chandrashekhar Gillurkar, director of Gillurkar Hospital and Research Institute, which is the only centre for these clinical trials in Maharashtra.“All three were selected after meeting the strict screening criteria. Their health parameters fit in our criteria and none of them has any comorbidity. First dose of 0.5ml intramuscular injection was given to them. We observed them for two hours and then allowed them to go home as they were all right,” said Dr Gillurkar, adding that no immediate side-effects have been observed in any of the three.The first three volunteers, who are Nagpur’s own corona warriors now, have been asked to follow their normal routine — wear masks, maintain Covid distancing and follow hand hygiene. They are not allowed to reveal their identity until the clinical trials are going on. Doctors will be constantly monitoring their health parameters. They will be called back on the 14th day for review tests.“During review, we will check whether their bodies have developed anti-bodies against the virus and, if yes, in what quantity. Provided everything goes well, they will be administered second dose of vaccine on 14th day,” said Dr Gillurkar.These participants have been administered the lowest strength dose of the vaccine. If it is found to be safe in them, higher doses will be administered to other volunteers from 14th day onwards.“On the 14th and 28th, we will take their blood samples and check whether antibodies have developed. This will decide success of the vaccine. Secondly, we will check them on 42nd and 104th day, and check how many antibodies are still in their bodies. This will decide the effective period of vaccine,” Dr Gillurkar added.Dr Gillurkar’s hospital is among the 12 sites selected by Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) for conducting phase I and II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of Covaxin. It’s the only centre in Maharashtra state. They have more than 50 interested people registered for human trials.“Five more participants have been shortlisted.

79,['27/07/2020'],Bizmen hail deferment of consent from PPCB for operating factories,"Ludhiana: A day after TOI reported state government’s orders to Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) to defer the requirement of renewal of consent by industrialists to run factories and other changes, businessmen are jubilant over the developments. According to them, with PPCB deferring the mandatory requirements, it is very relieving for them as in the wake of lockdown it is very difficult for them to complete the lengthy formalities to apply for the permissions from the PPCB.

Welcoming the decision, Gurmeet Singh Kular, president, Federation of Industrial & Commercial Organisation (FICO), “PPCB has extended the validity of consent for operation, authorisation, registration and any other mandatory regulatory clearances till March 31, 2021. Also in order to ensure the participatory regulation compliances of environmental regulations, the industry, which was operating without the consent of the board have been given time till December 31 for clearances under the voluntary disclosure scheme (VDS) with applicable fee only from January 1, 2019, for MSME. Extension of the consents required by industry and introducing VDS for the factories, which did not apply for the consent are highly appreciable steps and thousands of units of Ludhiana will be benefited because of this, particularly at this point of time when the completing the formalities for consent has become difficult.”

According to Upkar Singh Ahuja, President of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU), “This is a big relief for the industries as not only the formalities to obtain new consent or extend the validity of existing consent a lot of paperwork and huge formalities were required to be fulfilled. So at this time of Covid-19 it’s not easy to go from one office to another frequently just to complete the formalities and therefore the decision to extend the existing consents and deferring the requirement of consent from the non-registered units will help the industries immensely.”

Honey Sethi, organising secretary of CICU, “The PPCB’s decisions will prove to be highly beneficial for the industry and other departments too should replicate the similar practice and take measures to help the industry, which is struggling to even operate at this time of Covid-19 crisis. Departments should help the industry in these turbulent times by easing the procedures and extend deadlines. Not only will this help the existing industries, but will encourage the new investments in the state and save the Industry.”

80,['27/07/2020'],Lightmen’s wives take up jobs as domestic help to make ends meet,"Chennai: They illuminate cinema sets, but their lives are now steeped in darkness. With films shootings stopped and TV serial shoots allowed to resume only two weeks ago, wives of several lightmen have begun working as domestic help to keep the kitchen fire burning.

“I don’t have any work now, so my wife took up the job of a maid. She earns around Rs3,000 a month. Even though the money is not sufficient, we are managing because there is no other option,” says KK Nagar resident P Ganesh, a lightman for more than five years.

Ganesh would normally earn at least Rs25,000 a month, but the pandemic-imposed lockdown has left him with no choice. “I didn’t want my wife to work as a maid, but we have two children to take care of.”

There are more than 2,000 such ‘experts’ working with various cinema and TV serial companies in the city. Some of them, particularly bachelors, are looking for other jobs, even for daily wages, but very few have been lucky. “We were unable to pay the rent. I searched for jobs for daily wages, but finding one was difficult. It was my wife’s suggestion that she would work as a maid in a nearby house. It finally worked out,” says K Shanmugham, who had been working in some TV serial projects till the lockdown began.

B Xavier’s case is different. His wife wanted to look for a maid’s job in the neigbourhood, but his mother didn’t allow her to do the job. “My mother, who used to work as a maid, wanted to take it up again to make ends meet. She is 65 and I don’t want her to work but we have no other option,” says the man who has been working with an outdoor unit for more than 10 years.

The pandemic has hit the entire film industry hard, but it is such workers who are the worst hit, says G Venkatesh Kumar, whose short film ‘Lightmen’ (2016) documents their plight. “Even in normal days, they (lightmen) are the ones who are least paid. We all are having a tough time, but these people are facing more challenges because they are not paid enough,” says Kumar. “It was while documenting their lives in 2016 that I understood their lifestyle and family problems. I'm sure these last four months would have made their lives miserable,” he says.

81,['27/07/2020'],"Govt assures guv of security,Cong calls off protest in Raj","Jaipur: Rajasthan governor Kalraj Mishra on Sunday held discussions with chief secretary Rajeeva Swarup and DGP Bhupendra Singh Yadav over the state’s preparedness to check the spread of coronavirus and about the security of the Raj Bhavan considering the Congress protest that was initially scheduled for Monday but later called off.

The ruling party had been protesting to demand that the governor should accept the cabinet request to convene an assembly session. The request came amid claims by the party’s 19 dissident legislators, led by sacked deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot , that the Ashok Gehlot government has been reduced to a minority.

A statement released by the Raj Bhavan at 4.30pm on Sunday said the chief secretary and the DGP gave detailed information about adequate security arrangements made for the Raj Bhavan in the wake of Congress protest on Monday. Nearly two hours later, newly appointed PCC chief and cabinet minister Govind Singh Dotasra announced withdrawing the protest in Rajasthan.

“As part of the ‘Save Democracy-Save Constitution’ campaign, the Congress will protest outside Raj Bhavans in all states except Rajasthan. We have sent a revised request to the governor and hope that he would grant permission to convene the session soon,” Dotasra tweeted at 6.18pm.

The governor’s meeting with the executive heads created ripples in the state political circles, considering that chief minister Gehlot on Friday said he would not be responsible if people gherao the Raj Bhavan if the assembly was not convened soon. Gehlot had suggested that Mishra could be sitting on the cabinet request for the session due to pressure from the top (Centre).

The opposition BJP had termed the CM's statement an act of ‘terrorising’ the Raj Bhavan but fell short of calling it a failure of law and order in the state. A 15-member BJP delegation, which included Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria and party state president Satish Poonia, had met the governor on Saturday and urged him to take ‘appropriate action’ to ‘protect’ the people.

“Though Raj Bhavan's security is the duty of the government and police, the choice of words by the CM that ‘he will not be responsible’ created doubts and I demanded that the task be handed over to the CRPF,” Kataria told TOI on Sunday.

“The Congress protest proposed at the Raj Bhavans on Monday is undesirable as a governor cannot be made to take decisions through pressure politics. Seeking an assembly session is a cabinet right but the governor can always ask why the request is being made. Once the government replies to these queries, I am sure the governor will convene the session,” he added.

During the meeting with the chief secretary and the DGP, governor Mishra expressed concern over the spread of corona, saying that the positive cases in the state had grown three-fold since July 1. The governor said a new strategy would have to be considered to check the spread of the virus and directed the chief secretary to make serious efforts to tackle the disease.

Rajasthan had 3,317 active cases of Covid-19 on July 1 and the figure reached 9,935 at 10.30am on Sunday. The state saw the highest spike in a single day with 1,120 new cases reported on Saturday. There have been 621 deaths due to Covid-19 in the state till 10.30am on Sunday.

Thiruvananthapuram: With more wards in the city being declared containment zones, police are trying out-of-the-box measures to keep people from straying into these zones.

The city police have erected signs boards made of flex ( polyvinyl chloride flex boards), the use of which was banned by the state government last year owing to the environment issues it caused. City police officers said they took this step giving priority to people’s lives for the time being.

Police started erecting flex boards with warning signs after 12 wards in the city were declared containment zones by the collector on Friday. According to city police officers, they decided to use warning signs to stop people from entering the high-risk zones knowingly or unknowingly.

“Almost all the roads that lead to containment zones have been closed. It is not possible to deploy policemen at all these spots to stand guard. It is people’s responsibility too to voluntarily stay away from these places and hence, the department decided to use warning signs,” a senior police officer with the city police said. Flex boards were chosen so that it would not get damaged easily and the messages displayed on them would even survive heavy rain.

The officer further said all people might not be keeping track of wards that are declared as containment zones. Since establishments like banks are still functioning, there are chances that people may venture into the containment zones. These warning signs are also targeted at guest workers from other states who may not be following the local developments. The flex boards contains the symbol of the Kerala Police and the words ‘containment zone’ and ‘no entry’ are written in bold red letters.

At present more than 20 wards in the city are treated as containment zones as there are either high number of Covid-19 cases or sources of reported cases are unable to be traced. This includes the coastal wards that are considered as critical containment zones and wards located in the city such as Kowdiar, Pattom, Muttada, Chalai, Karamana, Thampanoor, Thycaud and also the Kazhakootam ward that houses major parts of the IT corridor of the city.

It was last year that they had decided to create the Miyawaki forest as a tribute to the late G Namalvar, an environment activist and nature scientist, said A Mohan, the headmaster of the Siluvarpatti Government Model Higher Secondary school near Devadanapatti.

As many as 900 saplings of guava, teak, mango, pomegranate, jamun, mahogany, nilavembu, neem and gooseberry among others were planted, by the students, at a distance of three feet from each other. A 40 x 40 feet open hall was constructed in the midst of this forest so that students could do their yoga classes there.

Each student was entrusted with the duty of nurturing a sapling. Apart from the forest, they also planted trees in other parts of the school and now this school has 1,200 trees- one for each student. It was the National Green Corps, district instructor, P Perunchithiran, who was instrumental in establishing this forest in the school. As the sand inside the school was clayey, it was removed and the silt obtained while desilting a tank in the neighbourhood, with the help of the district administration, was deposited here. This soil was enriched with market waste for some time before the forest was saplings were planted on it.

The headmaster also organized a drip irrigation system to ensure proper irrigation of the trees but the students had to remove the weeds and dry leaves from around the trees till they grew to a height. Now, the trees have grown tall. “There are so many bees as the trees have started flowering and we have decided to establish an apiary here later,” said Mohan.

Various types of birds like parrots, mynas, greater coucal, doves, quails and cuckoos have started frequenting this forest and nesting on the bigger trees. “The children would definitely come back to an environmentally-rich school after the lockdown where they can learn about nature practically,” said Mohan.

NEW DELHI: By next year, the drainage system and roads in Mayapuri , which were damaged considerably from chemicals and fumes arising out of vehicles being dismantled in the open, would be completely revamped through a Rs 55.3 crore plan, Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) said.

In 2018, after TOI had reported that not only were cars being cut in the open illegally, but several streets were blocked in the process at Mayapuri Industrial Area, National Green Tribunal (NGT) had ordered DPCC, DSIIDC and Delhi Police to clear the area and take action against offenders.

DPCC, in its report submitted to NGT this week, said the entire area was now under CCTV surveillance to ensure that no shopkeeper was dismantling vehicles there. It added that a drainage and road revamp plan would be executed by DSIIDC in the next 12 months.

“DSIIDC installed the CCTV camera network after it was commissioned by stationing it at Mayapuri police station. Police have reported no illegal activity in the area,” said the report.

The report also stated that the lockdown had disrupted the comprehensive project of rehabilitation of roads and drains. “The work, being undertaken at a cost of Rs 55.3 crore, has been restarted and DSIIDC has assured to complete it within 12 months,” it added.

Taking cognisance of TOI’s reports about the polluting activities and large-scale encroachment, NGT had last year directed DPCC and other authorities to act against violators and submit a detailed action-taken report. However, it had noted that while action on the ground should continue, scrapping of vehicles in an organised way was required for Delhi.

“The current capacity to scientifically scrap vehicles is hardly adequate. The available statistics show that approximately nine million vehicles (75% two-wheelers) will be due for scrapping by 2020. By the end of 2025, the number is likely to reach over 21 million. Hence, there should be an appropriate mechanism to set up authorised recycling centres compliant with environmental norms. An SOP needs to be drawn up for the purpose as has been done for the authorised handling of hazardous waste,” NGT had said.

A DPCC official said long-term measures had already been planned, while an NGT-appointed Special Task Force was also working on the scrapping policy.

KANPUR: Yet another video of Manu, wife of Shashikant Pandey, aide of slain gangster Vikas Dubey , surfaced on Sunday in which she recalls that Vikas ran amok prior to the ambush in Bikru on July 3 as he feared being killed in encounter by police.

Manu, in whose house deputy SP Devendra Mishra was killed, says in the video, “After pumping bullets into CO Devendra Mishra along with Amar and Atul, Vikas was constantly shouting at the CO and hurling choicest abuses at him. Vikas shouted at the CO that he had come to kill him in encounter, but see the consequence.”

Soon after his arrest in Ujjain, Vikas Dubey had also told police that he did not get along well with Circle Officer (CO) Devendra Mishra, as the latter always used to threaten him.

Dubey had also revealed that SHO Vinay Tiwari had also told him that Mishra was against him. He also confessed that he had crude bombs also that were kept in his maternal uncle’s house and were used against the cops during the ambush.

On receiving a tip-off about a police raid at his house from his sources, Vikas had asked all his aides to come to his house and bring along their firearms.

Investigators also found that after firing stopped, Vikas and village head Ram Singh Yadav went around checking policemen in torch light and pumped more bullets on finding them alive.

It also came to light that after killing eight policemen, Dubey had piled up five bodies one over the other and planned to set them on fire by pouring kerosene on them. He had stocked 50 gallons of kerosene for the purpose, but could not do so as the fear of being caught overpowered him and he fled with others.

Villagers in Bikru say Vikas was in the habit of abusing and pointing guns at people on the slightest of arguments.

Meanwhile, traders say that they have never witnessed such low business ever before Eid. It will be celebrated in Ludhiana on August 1.

The traders say that prices have fallen sharply this Eid as compared to previous ones.

“I had bought about 40 sheep for sale for Eid and for a sheep that I bought for Rs 20,000 I am being offered between Rs12,000-Rs 13,000. This is because of the fact that there is hardly any demand for sacrificial animals this time around as people don’t have money because of slump in business due to lockdown, etc.” said Haji Ehsan, a prominent trader at Bakra Mandi. “Normally people start buying sacrificial animal for Eid about 20 days before the festival but this time around even as Eid is less than a week away, there are hardly any buyers. As per rough estimate the business is not even 10% of what it was last year. Of the stock I had brought for sale on Eid and till now I have managed to sell just seven,” said Haji Ehsan, a prominent trader at Bakra Mandi near Jalandhar bypass.

The traders said that even as last year they had sold more than a thousand animals this year they don’t even expect 25% sales.

“Last year, business was good and we had sold around 150 animals on Bakr Eid. However, this year even as we have brought 50 animals, we have not sold many as there are hardly any customers this year. This is because of curfew lockdown and slump in business of people as they don’t have money to buy sacrificial animals,” said Sham Lal, a trader from Chand Cinema area. He added that earlier traders from Uttar Pradesh and other states would come to sell animals in Ludhiana Bakra Mandi, but this year only around 10 such traders had come.

Another trader asking not to be named gave an in depth view about the slump in business. “People have not earned anything for around four months and they are carrying on with their lives by spending on their reserve money. Under such circumstances, can we expect them to buy animal for Eid or survive in these trying times. Most of our customers (Muslims) are businessmen or those who are related to manufacturing sector, so as the lockdown hit the businesses and such sectors, so their spending power has decreased considerably,” said the trader.

“Almost every year we do buy animal for sacrifice on Bakr Eid but may be this year we will not do sacrifice on the festival due to slump in businesses. We are donating money to needy persons living in the neighbourhood,” said Akram Ali, a real estate adviser of Dhandari area.

87,['27/07/2020'],Private hosps treating non-Covid patients want testing norms eased,"Madurai: About a week after all private hospitals, including mid-level ones and small clinics, were directed to remain open for the public, the footfall of patients is slowly returning to normalcy, but doctors said Covid-19 testing has been a hurdle for them in treating patients. Doctors at private hospitals which are authorised to treat only non-Covid-19 patients said that despite remaining open, they are forced to turn away any patient with fever and cold as they cannot get them tested for Covid-19.

“More doctors and hospital staff who served non-Covid-19 patients have tested positive for Covid-19 than those serving in Covid-19 wards. Even in our hospital, a couple of hospital staff tested Covid-19 positive only last week,” said a duty medical officer at a mid-level hospital in Anna Nagar. Many of these smaller hospitals are forced to reduce their timings and function with limited staff since many of the staff are not turning up for work. “What is even more dangerous is that some patients, on hearing that we are sending away patients with fever, are taking paracetamol tablets to come and get treated for their other illnesses,” added the medical officer.

Currently, except for around 5% of private hospitals, which include clinics in congested areas or those in which the doctor is aged above 60 with co-morbid conditions, all other hospitals are functional. Doctors in such hospitals said that while they are ready to treat more non-Covid-19 patients, testing norms do not allow them to get their patients tested on the doctor’s discretion so that they can be treated by them if their results are negative.

“This is especially a concern for gynaecologists undertaking ANC cases. Recently, attenders of ANC patients tested positive at a hospital which was a risk for both patients and hospital staff. In such cases, both attenders and ANC mothers must be tested for Covid-19,,” said Dr Alagavenkatesan, president, Indian Medical Association (IMA) Madurai.

88,['27/07/2020'],Kerala: Arundhati Roy’s essay in Calicut University syllabus sparks row,"Arundhati Roy

KOZHIKODE: The inclusion of ‘ Come September ’, a lecture delivered by writer Arundhati Roy in 2002, in the Calicut University third semester BA English syllabus has sparked a controversy, with BJP state president K Surendran terming it anti-national and demanding immediate withdrawal of the article from the syllabus demanded registering a case against those responsible.

Surendran also took strong exception to the introduction about Arundhati Roy in the textbook stating that ‘In 2008 she supported the cause of Kashmiri independence and saluted the unarmed struggle of Kashmiris against the armed Indian military’.

“The said essay is taken from a speech which challenges the government’s policies and India’s Constitution. Ms Roy claims that the Indian state has unleashed terror on the non-violent struggle for Kashmir’s independence. Our poor students have been forced to learn a speech given to an anti-India audience against the Kargil war. This is akin to insulting those brave soldiers who gave up their lives to protect our territorial integrity,” Surendran said in a letter addressed to governor and chancellor Arif Mohammed Khan.

He said in a press release that BJP will launch an agitation and will take legal action if the article is not withdrawn from the syllabus.

The lecture ‘Come September’ was delivered by Roy on September 18, 2002, at the Lannan Foundation in Santa Fe, USA, which dealt on the broader theme of relationship between power and the powerless and how those who criticize the actions of the governments are being called ‘anti-nationals’.

The text book ‘Appreciating Prose’ was edited by Murukan Babu C R, a former member of the CU syndicate and Abida Farooqui, assistant professor at Government Arts and Science College, Kondotty, and former member of syndicate and former chairperson of board of studies in English. The textbook was brought out by a private publisher.

Syndicate member K K Haneefa said that academic bodies, including the board of studies, faculty and academic council had finalized the syllabus and added that the article could have been included in the prose paper as part of language study more than its content.

“We will democratically look into any complaint that we receive. But it is undemocratic to raise protests saying that an article of a writer like Arundhati Roy cannot be taught in colleges,” he added.

Meanwhile, Babu, co-editor of the textbook, said in a statement that his role and responsibility with regard to the textbook was minimal. It was limited to the capacity of being a co-author of the book which is, in fact, an edited compilation of the actual text of the lessons contained in the syllabus for the course, he said.

“The philosophies, theories and opinions expressed in the text are not of the editors’ but of the authors themselves or general in nature. The editors of the textbook never had any mala fide intention to include or propagate ideas or messages arousing anti-national feelings,” he said, adding that an expert committee by the university may examine whether any observation or reference in the syllabus or textbook as such contains and fosters any anti-national sentiments.

Apart from RT-PCR testing, the state has taken advantage of the 48 TrueNat testing centres located across the state to increase its Covid-19 testing footprint.A few weeks into the outbreak, the National AIDS Control Organisation accorded its permission to use HIV viral load testing labs in Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada for Covid-19 testing.Dr C Prabhakara Reddy, special officer, State Covid Control Centre, said that the state will set up four more RT-PCR laboratories and bring in 20 more TrueNat machines to enhance the testing capacity. “The new TrueNat machines are eight slot machines, which means that eight samples can be tested simultaneously. While the first few machines are two slot machines, the recently procured devices are four slot ones. The eight slot machines will significantly improve the testing capacity,” said Dr Reddy.The state had to send the first few Covid samples to laboratories outside Andhra Pradesh as it only got its first laboratory in the middle of March in Tirupati with a testing capacity of 90 samples a day. Soon, the state leveraged various testing modalities validated by the ICMR such as TrueNat testing, rapid antibody testing and rapid antigen testing.Andhra Pradesh collected its first sample on February 1.

The decision was taken on Saturday after brother of one of the Ranji probables tested positive for Covid-19.

The association said that it is taking all precautions to ensure that none of its players get infected with the virus.

“We have suspended the training camp for two weeks after family members of one of the cricketers was detected positive for Covid,” said Ajit Lele, BCA secretary.

The association had started training camp for Ranji cricketers at Motibaug Ground last month.

Thirty cricketers were undergoing training sessions in the batch of 10 each and care was taken to maintain proper social distance among the players.

The BCA, though, kept training camps of junior cricketers and women players suspended even after the lockdown ended.

BCA officials said that the training camp was started to ensure that the senior cricketers remain fit ahead of the Ranji season. “But with Covid-19 virus spreading across the city, the camp may remain suspended for a longer time now,” a BCA official said.

BCA had to recently conduct its annual general meeting (AGM) online and seek votes by postal ballots after some of its members raised the safety issues due to Covid pandemic.

COLVA: A week before the 45-day ban on mechanised fishing comes to an end, traditional fishermen in Colva netted around 350kg of solar prawns.

This is the first catch and in the coming days, many traditional fishermen along the coastline will venture out for their share of shrimps.

For the traditional fishermen, this is a crucial period to fetch some revenue as once the trawlers venture into the sea, they harvest most of the shrimps, a fisherman said.

“Solar shrimps are seasonal and they surface for around a fortnight and then disappear,” the fisherman added.

As the word spread that prawns were available at the Colva beach , a large number of people rushed to purchase their share at Rs 250 per kg. The remaining quantity of solar shrimps were taken to the Colva market where they were sold out within no time.

The family of the deceased alleged it seems the statements of the accused were false as the Sanjeet’s body could not be traced yet.

“We demand narco analysis test of all the five accused. The investigation should also be handed over to CBI as we are not satisfied with police probe,” said Ruchi, sister of Sanjeet while talking to reporters on Sunday.

She added the river has knee-deep water despite onset of monsoon and it’s likely the body may have been dumped somewhere else to wipe out evidence.

Sanjeet’s mother Kusuma Yadav said, “On July 23 & 24, policemen came and informed that my son has been killed. When we asked them to give his body, they said search is on in Pandu river. We demand narco analysis of accused and CBI investigation into the case.”

“It has been three days, since PAC divers were asked to fish out the body from the river, but it is still missing,” said a relative.

“It seems the accused gave misleading information. They should be grilled again,” he added.

Teams of police and PAC divers searched up to eight km downstream of the river connecting Fattepur Gohi and Uriyara villages. Police and PAC divers resumed search as a motorboat was also roped in on Sunday morning, but failed to trace the body.

“We will resume search on Monday morning, and hope we find the body,” said Circle Officer Govindnagar Vikas Pandey.

Sanjeet, a lab technician, was kidnapped from Barra area on June 22, and murdered by his abductors. According to police, the kidnappers killed Sanjeet on June 26-27, a few days after abducting him, and dumped his body in Pandu river.

Police arrested five people, including two friends of Sanjeet, in the case.

His family alleged kidnappers had escaped with Rs 30 lakh ransom in the presence of police.

On July 23, five accused Gyanendra, Kuldeep, Neelu, Ramji, Preeti were arrested. They revealed they had taken a room on rent at Ratan Lal Nagar to keep the captive.

Several Samitis in the city that install Ganesha idols in pandals have also decided to celebrate the festival without much pomp. Instead of huge Ganesha idols of 7ft and above, they have decided to install idols of about 3 – 4ft. Decades ago, we started the tradition by preparing very few idols for families.

The family of the deceased accused the police of beating him to death. Police have lodged a case under Section 176 of the CrPC and launched a probe into the matter. While SHO Kamalchand Meena of the thana has been suspended, the entire staff has been sent to police lines.

The judicial probe has been ordered into the alleged custodial death following a demand from his family. “It's not proven as of now that he died in police custody, as on record, he was not in custody. However, an inquiry under Section 176 of the CrPC by the judicial magistrate is being carried out in the matter,” Jhalawar SP Kiran Kang Sidhu said.

The youth, identified as Rajesh Meena, a resident of Raiger Basti in Khanpur town of Jhalawar district , was taken to a hospital after his condition deteriorated, ASP Jhalawar Rajesh Yadav claimed.

But two trees of a species that produce beads similar to the original are thriving in the Vasna barrage compound. The caretaker of the compound planted them about a decade ago. Now they produce thousands of prayer beads every year.Nanubhai Rabari, the caretaker, said these trees produce ‘panchmukhi’ prayer beads, which are considered best for religious rituals.“The trees began yielding beads about five years ago,” said Rabari, 63. “I have donated these to most of the temples in Ahmedabad, as well as to people who want them.” He said that these are the only two trees of their kind in Ahmedabad.Rabari said that the beads have to be soaked in ghee for about ten days before they get their deep red colour. “The beads are used by most Shiva temples in Ahmedabad, along with other temples as well,” Rabari said.

VISAKHAPATNAM: With supply of marine and inland fish drastically reduced, fish prices skyrocketed at all harbour markets in Visakhapatnam on Sunday. Traders said that fish supply at landing centres has reduced over the last few weeks as fishermen are not venturing into the seas after many of them tested positive for Covid-19.

Arjili Dasu, secretary of District Fishermen’s Youth Welfare Association, said, “There are over 100 positive cases in fishing villages in Visakhapatnam. Under such circumstances, fishermen are not venturing out to sea.”

“This has led to a scarcity in the market which has led to an increase in price. The price would increase further unless supply restores,” Dasu added.

The Visakhapatnam harbour, which usually sees huge crowds especially on weekends, wore a deserted look on Sunday morning. The number of vendors in the market was few and far between.

Ummidi Yallarao, a wholesaler, said that news of fishermen being affected with the virus has spread and there is an apprehension among traders that fishing harbours could be sites of infection. A few traders too have tested positive, he added.

The price of pomfret, which usually ranges between Rs 600 and Rs 800 per kg in landing centres sold for Rs 1,500 to Rs 1,800 a kilogram on Sunday. “Transportation costs have gone up significantly since the lockdown. This is not the right time to buy and sell fish. We are hardly making any profit,” Yallarao told TOI.

Fisheries associations however maintain that stopping fishing activities is not a good idea especially at the beginning of the season. They have sent a set of proposals to the fishing department to ensure that no overcrowding takes place in harbours and that people visiting markets follow Covid-19-related standard operating procedure (SOP).

But the fisheries department doesn’t seem to be in a position to implement the SOP at the moment as many department officials too have tested positive for Covid-19 and are currently in quarantine, said Arjili Dasu.

The trio — Imran Saify and Javed Saify from Meerut and Narendra, alias, Rohit, from Gautam Buddh Nagar — were arrested from the Zero Point under Majhola police station limits, following a tip-off.

Police said the gang was involved in several cases of theft. In 2015, the gang committed theft of Rs 72 lakh in Chattisgarh, and then they stole Rs 3.29 in Haryana’s Bahadurgarh.

Moradabad superintendent of police (city) Amit Kumar Anand told TOI, “We have seized around Rs 2.42 lakh cash, an LED TV, silver coins, a wristwatch and equipment used in breaking locks and impounded a Swift car from the possession of the accused, who have been lodged in jail.”

“Gang members would first conduct recces in posh localities and then target locked houses. The accused are history-sheeters and have been involved in several cases of theft in different states and have been booked by various police stations in Gurugram, Faridabad and Raipur, among other places,” added the SP.

On July 21, the gang broke entered the house of a bank employee in Sector 10 of Buddhi Vihar Colony and fled with Rs 97,000 cash, jewellery, and an LED television. A case was registered under sections 380 (theft in dwelling house, etc) and 454 (lurking house-trespass or house-breaking in order to commit offence punishable with imprisonment) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against unidentified persons.

Further information about the past criminal records of the accused is being gathered and effort is on to nab other members of the gang, said police.

JAIPUR/ALWAR: A forest homeguard was mowed down by a tractor belonging to suspected mining mafia inside Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR) on Sunday after he attempted to stop them along with his colleague. The guard was rushed to a hospital where he succumbed to injuries. Cops are yet to arrest the accused, but have seized the tractor. This is not the first time that forest officials have been attacked inside STR.

The deceased has been identified as Keval Singh. He was in his mid-40s. STR DFO Seduram Yadav said, “On Sunday, the guard along with his colleague went for patrol in Baldevgarh checkpost area of the tiger reserve where they saw certain individuals illegally transporting bajri from the forest area. When the guards tried to stop them, they mowed him down with a tractor.”

A case has been registered at Tehela police station in Alwar .

“We will get the sketch of the accused after taking details from the other guard who was with the deceased at the time of the incident. If he can give us names of persons who were behind the attack, we will arrest them at the earliest,” Alwar SP Tejaswini Gautam said.

This is not the first time that villagers have attacked forest officials. On January 25, a forest ranger of STR Jitendra Chaudhary had to run for his life after being attacked by villagers. The villagers attacked him after he and his 10-member team confiscated 18 sheeps and 30 goats for illegal grazing in the tiger reserve.

On December 15, 2019, senior forest officials were allegedly manhandled by villagers in the tiger reserve. Following this, a case against 20 identified accused was registered at the Bansur police station. The reserve is spread across 1,281 sq-km area and is divided into six ranges. There are just 108 forest guards, which is far less than its sanctioned strength of 132. Moreover, with the menace of frequent attacks in Sariska, unarmed forest guards often struggle to protect the area.

WARANGAL/HYDERABAD: A TRS legislator’s personal assistant (PA) was arrested late on Sunday, about 24 hours after he allegedly abused and attacked a lady doctor on duty at Warangal ’s Mahatma Gandhi Hospital over delay in treatment, leading to massive protests by 300 doctors throughout the night.

Witnesses and police said a patient, identified as Sai Krishna, went to MGM hospital after suffering an injury to his leg on Saturday evening. A preliminary investigation revealed that a needle was stuck inside his leg and required surgery.

Around 9.30 pm, Sai Krishna’s relative, Chaitanya, who is a PA to Husnabad MLA , V Satish Babu, started to question a PG doctor, Sowmya Sada , about the delay in attending him. The doctor asked them to wait since a doctor from another department was expected to come, but Chaitanya repeatedly claimed that he is the PA of an MLA, launched a verbal assault on the lady doctor and allegedly hurled a chair at her.

Subsequently, all the medical staff withdrew from their service, assembled in front of the hospital and staged a protest. Around 6 am, they called off the strike after senior doctors of the hospital assured strict action against Chaitanya, besides assuring security to all medical staff. Token protests also took place on Sunday, but work was unaffected. “As per complaint given by PG doctor Sowmya, Chaitanya used objectionable language besides hurling a chair in the emergency ward,” an official said. The other doctors had to come to the rescue of Sowmya and later police was called, who took Chaitanya into custody, he added.

A case was registered against Chaitanya by Matwada police on the charges of restraining a government official on duty and he was taken into custody, before being arrested. The Telangana Doctors Federation condemned the incident and demanded more security at the hospital.

118,['27/07/2020'],Kerala: Ancient stone monuments found in Idukki’s Anchuruli,"They are prehistoric but not of Stone Age, and are not new to archaeology

IDUKKI: Prehistoric stone monuments have been discovered in Anchuruli in the catchment area of Idukki .

Dating back 2,500- 3,000 years ago, the megaliths , including menhirs (large stones in an upright position), cists (burial chambers) and dolmens (a type of stone monument) were found after the water level receded in Pezhumkandam Anchuruli area of the reservoir.

Researchers of the Archeological and Historical Conservation forum who discovered the megaliths claimed they are remnants of a human settlement that lived about 3,000 years ago in the region.

“The topography, soil and Neolithic remains need to be seriously studied,” said Rajeev Puliyoor, principal of BEd College, Nedumkandam, one of the members in the research team. Last month, researchers had discovered rock carvings, known as petroglyphs, in Kallipara Mountains in Thoppramkudi in the district.

When the water level increases in the dam, these historical evidences will be under the water, he said, pointing to the urgent need to conduct more studies.

Historian and former vice-chancellor of Mahatma Gandhi University Rajan Gurukkal said the remains seem to be slabs of collapsed dolmens. “One is a menhir, rather intact. These are Iron Age megalithic burial monuments, not remains of habitation. They are prehistoric but not of Stone Age, and are not new to archaeology. They are in plenty in different parts of the district, especially in the high ranges. Dating suggested can be right, but generally, experts assign the monuments an antiquity of 2,500 years.”

He also pointed out that excavations under the supervision of the ‘alleged’ organizations are illegal, unless licensed by the Archaeological Survey of India. “Their preservation initiatives are welcome though,” said Gurukkal.

GURUGRAM: A gym owner has been booked for allegedly opening the gym despite the government orders against such activities during the pandemic. The gym is located in Khandsa and was shut down late Friday night, a police officer said.

According to the complaint filed by a policeman from Shivaji Nagar police station, they received a tip-off that four men were working out in a gym called Fitness Gym near Khandsa. Following the tip-off, a team reached the spot and conducted a raid. “We found the gym to be functional and the four men were working out despite the government orders asking such places to be shut,” the police officer said in his statement.

He added that none of the people within the premises were wearing masks thereby increasing the chances of spreading the virus and infecting others. An FIR was registered at Shivaji Nagar police station under sections 51 of the Disaster Management Act , 120-B (punishment of criminal conspiracy) and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant) under IPC.

This is not the first such instance when an FIR has been registered against a gym during the pandemic. Reeling under financial crisis due to the two-month long lockdown, a gym owner called some customers for working out inside the gym, despite the government restriction on the function of gyms and spa, and landed in legal trouble in June. Police, after receiving a call, had raided the gym and booked 17 persons, including the gym owner, for the violation of lockdown norms.

Dheer Katariya (32), owner of Mould Gym spread over two floors of a building in Dayanad Colony, said he was struggling to meet his expenses as his only source of earning was closed for the last two months.

121,['27/07/2020'],Telangana Corona Update: Doctors protest as health dept transfers 800 of their seniors to hospitals across Telangana,"State’s plan is to depute doctors where surge of cases is expected

HYDERABAD: In a bid to tackle the surge of Covid-19 cases in districts, the state health department has deputed over 800 senior resident doctors to various government hospitals in a hurried manner without conducting general counselling. As a result, a large number of PG doctors who are to report to duty on Monday, are in two minds on whether to take up the post or to report and then do a vanishing act.

The reason is many PGs have been deputed in remote corners of the state where they have no support system, accommodation or help and have to report at short notice. At least 120 of the PGs have already expressed their unhappiness over the one-year deputation given without asking for their preferences.

In a letter written to the health secretary, PG doctors from Telangana batch 2017-2020 stated, “Many PGs are in a dilemma about reporting and even more are considering to not join duties after reporting because of the extreme personal difficulties associated with unexpected work in a far off place without support. This is a bad outcome for both the government health department and for us PGs too.”

While the PG doctors have clarified they are ‘more than willing to render our services to the government in this unprecedented crisis’, the manner in which the allotment was carried out has left them inconvenienced. “It will cause undue hassles for hundreds of PGs and their families. Such random and forced allocations without considering preferences, domicile and fairness appears unjust and high-handed to all of us. Instead of facilitating and easing our process, the decision has jolted and has discouraged many of us,” the letter added. The PGs have urged health authorities to allow a mutual transfer of allotments between PGs.

He then frequented their house and convinced the family that Pandarinath and Chandubai were possessed by evil spirits.The double murder came to light when Pandarinath’s father Shivram, who was visiting a relative in Bhiwandi, realised that he had forgotten to take his diabetes medicine. He called up Pandarinath, but got no response. Worried, Shivram called up a relative, Devendra Bhoir.Bhoir told cops that around 4.30pm, when he and his mother reached Pandarinath’s residence, no one answered the doorbell but they could hear screams from inside. He peeped through the window and saw some ritual was on and Kavita, Vinayak and the teen beating Pandarinath with bamboos. Bhoir told the police that when he asked them to stop, Kavita and Vinayak told him that they were “divine beings driving out the evil spirit”.

128,['27/07/2020'],"Kalapani issue an irritant, needs to be resolved soon, says Nepal’s ambassador to India","Nilambar Acharya, the Nepalese ambassador to India, in an exclusive interaction with TOI on Friday, termed the Kalapani issue an ""irritant"", that needs to be resolved soon. Acharya, who has also served as Nepal’s law and justice minister and the country’s envoy to Sri Lanka, gave detailed email responses to queries put to him by TOI on issues like the sudden action by Nepal to include the Kalapani areas in its map at a time when India and China are in a stand-off, whether Nepal was acting at the behest of China, PM Oli’s remarks on Ayodha, Nepal’s expectations from India, and more. Excerpts:There is still so much goodwill in India for the people of Nepal. At a time when India was busy fending off the Chinese in Ladakh, many feel the inclusion of Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh and Kalapani in Nepal's map was something Kathmandu could have done without. Your comment.It is well known that Nepal and India have a long tradition of friendly relations. These relations are multi-layered and multi-dimensional, comprising interactions between the two governments, private sectors and people to people connection. When relations are so vast and deep between two close neighbours, it is natural that issues and complications arise at times. It is not realistic to expect that relations can always be totally problem-free. However, what is important is the question of how promptly and how appropriately we address these issues and do not allow them to fester.Nepal has been wanting early settlement of the issue. Given that the major segment of Nepal-India boundary alignment has been agreed and strip maps have been jointly prepared, resolution of the small remaining portions would not be difficult if we were prepared to tackle the issue. On various occasions in the past, both countries had acknowledged that the question of boundary alignment in Kalapani area needed to be resolved. Contrary to this understanding, announcements of unilateral acts like road construction triggered noise. The only way to close the chapter is to address the issue and settle it. The matter is as simple as that.Though there was disagreement between the two countries on these areas for a long time, it had never come to this. What is Nepal thinking?As you rightly mentioned, this is not at all a new issue and Nepal’s claim over Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura is known to the Indian side. These areas lie east of Kali River and hence, belong to Nepal as per the Treaty of Sugauli. It is also known that Nepal has been consistently emphasising on the resolution of the outstanding boundary issue through friendly talks. In fact, as recently as in December last year, the government of Nepal approached the Indian side to set up the dates for the meeting of the foreign secretaries who have been mandated to talk on this issue. That was immediately after the government of India issued a new political map. Dates of the meeting could not be fixed and the issue remained. Majority of our boundary alignment is settled. Let’s find settlement on the remaining two small segments and declare complete resolution of the Nepal-India boundary. When that happens, a long-standing irritant of Nepal-India bilateral relations would be left behind once and for all.Indian politicians have claimed that New Delhi tried to speak with Kathmandu, while your government said they attempted to speak to India but nothing worked. What happened actually?As I mentioned earlier, immediately after the government of India published the new political map in November 2019 depicting Kalapani area in it, we reiterated our concern. We also reminded earlier understanding at the highest political level between the two countries that the outstanding boundary issues would be resolved through dialogue. In our subsequent communications, we proposed dates for the foreign secretary-level talk. This has already come to public knowledge that we did not receive a response on setting the dates for the talk. Who responded and who did not is not the main question now. The main thing is what we would do next. On our part, we have made it clear that there is no alternative to dialogue to find a mutually acceptable settlement of this irritant. And we look forward to an early meeting at the foreign secretary-level to talk on the outstanding boundary questions.What are the confidence-building measures at work currently between the two countries?Nepal-India relations are not confined to one particular issue or one particular sector. Issues are transient; relations go on. No doubt the boundary question at Kalapani sector has been an irritant that would warrant an early resolution, but our vast relations are not confined to that. There are multiple areas where our engagements and co-operation continue. There are at least two dozen bilateral mechanisms between the two countries pertaining to different areas of engagements. Current Covid-19 related travel restrictions may have caused delay in holding the meetings of some of these important mechanisms, but they will soon resume hopefully. We have established mechanisms for the engagements at ministerial level and at the level of highest political leadership as well.Media, especially the social media, is abuzz with Nepal’s closeness with China. Some also view Nepal’s current stand-off with India as being due to pressure from Beijing. Your view on this?Responsible media has a great purpose of informing people, raising awareness and empowering citizens, not misinforming, misleading and misguiding the situation. Nepal is a sovereign country and has its own independent outlook in foreign policy and external engagements. It’s true that we have close relations and a vast magnitude of co-operation with both our big neighbours and with other friendly countries in the world. But we do not cultivate relations with one country at the expense of the relations with the other. In today’s interconnected world, engagements are not a zero sum game. So, the insinuation about Nepal acting under other countries’ pressure is totally baseless and does not hold ground. For the past 20 years, we have wanted to settle the boundary issue with India through dialogue, which did not happen. When the issue is kept alive, it comes up. How can you simply ignore the entire genesis of the issue and when the years-old issue is reiterated, you say it is done on somebody else’s pressure? Such dismissive and superficial excuses will take us nowhere.India and Nepal have had 'roti-beti' ties and have close social, cultural and religious links. Will not souring of political relations impact these ties?I have already said, Nepal-India relations are not confined to one particular issue or particular area. The scope and depth of these relations are immense and the traditional cultural proximity as well as the adherence to the sacrosanct principles of sovereign equality, mutual respect and mutual benefit provide solid foundation to these relations. It is also true that when a difficult phase comes up in our bilateral relations due to one issue or the other, its impact on public sentiment cannot be denied. Moreover, the question of boundary is strongly associated with people’s emotions. Responsibility of the governments and conscious sections of the societies on both sides is, therefore, two-pronged — first it is our responsibility that we address the irritant of bilateral relations in a timely and appropriate manner and second, we ensure that a particular issue does not bulge out to spoil the wider spectrum of neighbourly relations.PM Oli has recently made a few statements which have not gone down well in India like his claim that New Delhi was trying to topple his government as well as his remarks on Ayodhya. Your reaction?There was no intention otherwise in the statements of the Prime Minister. Concerning remarks on Ayodhya, our foreign ministry has clarified that the Prime Minister was simply stating the importance of further study and research on the vast cultural geography represented by the Ramayana. He spoke at a programme organised to mark the birth anniversary of the poet Bhanubhakta Acharya, who had translated the Ramayana into Nepali language. His remarks were not linked to any political subject. There is no need to engage in the game of exaggeration.How do you view calls by certain sections in Nepal to restore monarchy in the country? Do you think that would ever be feasible?The democratically-elected constituent assembly had already settled, while promulgating the Constitution, the question of the kind of polity arrangement Nepal would have. Monarchy is, therefore, a matter of history now and there is no question of returning to the past.Finally, how do you see India-Nepal relations in future? What are Nepal's expectations from India as its closest neighbour?As close neighbours, our two countries are bound to remain friends. Our societies evolved together as civilisations with shared characteristics. This civilisational connection will continue to remain as a strong pillar of our relations. So will the connection of nature and geography. Over 6,000 rivers and rivulets originating from Nepal’s Himalayas contribute to the larger portion of the water mass that flows in the river Ganga. In normal times, thousands of people from both sides cross the international border every day for various pursuits including employment, medical treatment, education, pilgrimage and tourism. All these speak of the strength of the undercurrent of Nepal-India relations. Today, as India grows economically and marches towards becoming a more prosperous society, we feel enthused. Prosperity on one side of the frontier will logically have positive impacts on the other side. Given the size and scale of Indian economy and given the depth of our economic connection, we see an opportunity in India’s economic rise. We, therefore, desire the best of relations with India and also expect that India would be forthcoming in addressing the outstanding issues that have remained there for years and gained heat every now and then. We expect that some of the big-ticket undertakings like Pancheshwar Multiple Project are implemented without delay in order to set a positive precedent that our two countries can do big things together. We expect that we would be able to work out a more enabling arrangement on bilateral trade so that the huge trade deficit is bridged. We also need to enhance transit and connectivity further. We likewise expect that there is no delay in addressing the issues like inundation that directly impact the people. Following the direction from our leaders, a joint technical team has identified a number of measures to be taken to reduce the inundation havoc on the Nepal side in the bordering area. These measures need to be sincerely and expeditiously implemented. Structures on one side of the border should not cause submergence of homes and farmland on the other side. Further, Nepal’s expectation is to advance the 21st century Nepal-India relations based on the principles of sovereign equality, mutual respect and mutual benefit. These are natural expectations of a friendly neighbour.",dehradun,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kalapani-issue-an-irritant-needs-to-be-resolved-soon-says-nepals-ambassador-to-india/articleshow/77181426.cms

MEERUT: Feared UP gangster Sunil Rathi is still calling the shots from the country's high-security Tihar Prison in Delhi, UP Police said on Sunday as it arrested one of his aides for allegedly shooting dead a Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) functionary in Baghpat. Rathi was transferred to Tihar after he allegedly shot dead another gangster Munna Bajrangi inside Baghpat Jail on July 9, 2018.

But, UP Police now believes that it didn’t stop him.

On July 7, RLD’s Deshpal Khokhar was shot dead in Baghpat’s Badrakha village by three men. Khokar was involved in a dispute with Rathi’s local aides over sand mining in the region. He was not allowing their vehicles to pass through his region.

“Three police teams were working round the clock to crack the case. The main shooter, Sourav alias Goli , was arrested on Sunday. And he acted at the behest of criminal Sunil Rathi currently lodged in Tihar,” said Ajay Kumar, superintendent of police (SP) Baghpat. According to SP Kumar, Saurabh and his two aides carried out the killing.

Apart from trying to arrest the remaining two accused, the local police are also working to find out how Rathi was able to establish contact with his aides. Rathi was transferred to Tihar Jail on court orders.

133,['27/07/2020'],"Doctors stress need for early diagnosis, wait for nod to start plasma therapy","Mangaluru: Amid mounting Covid-19 cases in the coastal districts of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi , doctors are increasingly looking for feasible solutions to arrest its spread. At the Wenlock Hospital , doctors are awaiting approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to start plasma therapy for Covid-19 patients, with 10 donors having consented to donate plasma, said in-charge district health officer Dr Ratnakar.The officer pointed to the problems confronting the department of health and family welfare owing to the stigma associated with Covid-19, which had resulted in several patients trying to conceal their symptoms. “If we start treatment early, complications can be taken care of easily. In many cases, patients approach doctors only when they have difficulty in breathing, and when we admitted them, we had to shift them immediately to the ICU,” Dr Ratnakar said.Stigma worsens situationDr Sandeep Samethadka Nayak, a physician of internal medicine in California in the United States of America, said that prevalence of misconceptions about the pandemic was among the reasons why many Covid-19 patients were falling prey to quackery. Calling for concerted efforts to battle the stigma associated with the pandemic, Dr Nayak said, “When I was practicing in Puttur, many patients would ask me not to disclose their illnesses to others. Such fears still persist among the people, and one way to resolve it is to break down complicated facts and concepts into simple language and make them understand.”Jimmy Xavier, a radio jockey with Radio Mirchi in Bengaluru, recently donated plasma to help with the efforts against the pandemic. “Stigma remains a roadblock in the fight against Covid-19. People who have the infection appear to labour under guilt of inconveniencing others. For many patients, the opinion of others appears to matter more than their own life,” Xavier said.Dr Supriya Hegde Aroor, psychiatrist and professor at Father Muller Medical College Hospital, said that it was fear that was driving the culture of ostracism. “Some people have started to think along the lines of ‘Will I die alone because of Covid?’, ‘Will I be stuffed in a PPE and laid to rest?’ This results in people not talking about the disease freely, and worsens the situation,” she said.Associate professor in the department of psychiatry, Yenepoya Medical College Dr Ravichandra Karkal pondered over the contradictory response of a large section of the public to reports of Amitabh Bachchan contracting the virus, for whose recovery many people started praying, which stood in stark contrast to the callous stance they adopted on learning of a neighbour testing positive for the novel coronavirus. “Stigma creates a sense of shame and the person with the disease is dehumanised. We need to also see that many people are recovering from the infection. This was once the problem associated with tuberculosis, HIV and many mental health problems too,” Dr Karkal said.",mangaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/doctors-stress-need-for-early-diagnosis-wait-for-nod-to-start-plasma-therapy/articleshow/77186766.cms

136,['27/07/2020'],"Hyderabad: Insurance firm told to refund Rs 2 lakh, pay Rs 50,000 for forgery","Representative Image

HYDERABAD: The district consumer forum here, has directed an insurance firm to refund Rs 2 lakh and pay Rs 50,000 as compensation for forging the signature of the insurer and for investing the amount in an insurance policy instead of a long-term investment plan.

Complainant CB Rajendra Prasad submitted that he was approached by a manager of Tata AIA Life Insurance Co Ltd in 2012 with a lucrative proposal of one-time investment in their organisation, and also suggested making such investments in his son’s name as the complainant was aged 60.

Believing them, he had invested Rs 2 lakh. As his son resides in USA, he informed the manager that he would prefer a one-time investment and his son would sign the required documents after he returned to India. Prasad had even handed over a copy of his son’s passport as the identity proof.

A few days later, Prasad was shocked after he received an insurance policy document via courier in his son’s name, which had his son’s forged signatures. Immediately, he brought the issue to the notice of the insurance company and requested them to return the policy and refund the amount. He even issued legal notices. Left with no option, he approached the consumer forum seeking relief.

The representatives of the insurance firm, in their written version, claimed that Prasad voluntarily purchased the policy and that he should have availed the free-look period immediately after receiving the policy document. They said that the policy was sourced through the manager and that the firm has disassociated with him and that allegations of mis-selling and forgery by the manager cannot be looked in by them at such a belated stage.

During the trial, the bench noticed that the opposite party had not produced any evidence to prove that the signatures of the insured on the proposal form are genuine and not forged. The bench further said that the firm had been unfair in investing the amount in an insurance policy rather than in a long-term investment in the company that too in the name of his son, which is against insurance norms.

Apart from refund and compensation, Rs 10,000 was awarded towards the costs incurred by the complainant.

Vadodara: City police on Sunday booked 12 persons who had allegedly encroached upon the road in Mangal Bazaar and blocking traffic movement through narrow lanes of the market.

Police said that a team of City police station was patrolling in the busy Mangal Bazaar on Sunday afternoon.

They noticed several vendors who were either squatting on road or had placed their carts for business.

Police said that the vendors were asked to wind up their business as they were blocking the road, resulting in traffic jam.

Offences were registered at City police station for obstructing public way against these 12 vendors.

On the other hand, vendors alleged that they were taken to the police station and beaten up by cops.

“The cops beat us with belt and wooden sticks inside the police station. We are only doing business and if police think that we have done something wrong they may book us, but why should they resort to violence,” said one of the vendors.

Police have, however, refuted the allegations.

146,['27/07/2020'],Guest lecturers seek salary dues from govt,"Coimbatore: Guest lecturers from government arts and science colleges in the state have alleged that they have not been paid salary since April.

Guest lecturers are recruited every academic year in June. As the financial year ends by March, the pay for April is given the next academic year along with the pay for June and July, they said.

But, this year as colleges were closed towards March end, guest lecturers have not been paid since April, and also as the colleges have not begun yet, they have not been roped in for classes. As many guest lecturers depend on this income for livelihood, the non-payment of dues has affected them.

V Thangaraj, representative of Tamil Nadu All Government College UGC Qualified Guest Lecturers Association, said across the state there were 4,084 guest lecturers in government arts and science colleges. “We are working for a monthly pay of Rs 15,000, and many of us are solely dependent on this. The UGC has said the lockdown period should be considered ‘on duty’ for us as well. But we have not been paid,” he said.

Usually they don’t get paid for May, but they would be roped in for exam duty and evaluation work, from which they would get some income. But this year there were no exams, he said. “We urge that the state government pay us considering the crisis we are in due to the lockdown,” he said.

T Veeramani, president of Tamil Nadu Government Collegiate Teachers’ Association, said there were 34 guest lecturers in the Coimbatore Government Arts College. “The state has to consider their situation and pay them.” TNN

147,['27/07/2020'],"Spurious drug: Police search houses in Ahmedabad, Surat","Nandrolone decanoate repackaged as tocilizumab

AHMEDABAD: City crime branch teams probing into the spurious tocilizumab case conducted searches at houses in Ahmedabad and Surat on Saturday.

Cops raided the house of Nilesh Laliwala, an accused, in the Paldi area of Ahmedabad. Another team searched the house of the main accused, Sohel Tai, at Lalgate in Surat. Boxes of protein powder were found in Ahmedabad, while empty ampoules and boxes of steroids were found in Surat.

Police said that they had leads on the location of Sohel Tai, but two other accused, Ashish and Akshay Shah were yet to be located.

“We are using cellphone tracking and human network to trace the accused,” said an investigator.

Police said the modus operandi of the racket had become clearer after interrogating Nilesh Laliwala and Harsh Thakor, who were placed in police custody by the court on Thursday.

The spurious injections were of generic nandrolone decanoate, an anabolic steroid primarily used in anaemia and wasting syndrome. Sohel Tai, who owns Genic Pharma that markets anabolic steroids sent the ampoules to Ahmedabad where Laliwala and Thakor used to relabel them as tocilizumab and send the boxes back to Surat, a crime branch official said.

Once relabelling and repacking was done, Tai, with the brother-duo Ashis and Akshay Shah, both residents of Sabarmati, marketed the fake tocilizumab. “Our priority is to dig out where else, besides Ahmedabad and Surat, the racket had sold the fake drugs,” a crime branch official said.

The Food and Drugs Control Administration (FDCA) had initially busted the racket with the trail leading to a hospital in Vastraput. A complaint was then lodged at Vastrapur police station last Monday against Ashish and Akshay Shah, Harsh Thakor of Chandkheda, Nilesh Laliwala of Paldi, and Sohel Tai of Surat. The probe was then handed over to city crime branch.

Tocilizumab is among the few drugs which have been effective in reducing Covid-related complications during this pandemic.

They injured me with the same sticks and killed the dog,” said Dhanalakshmi. “I have asked the civic officials to conduct animal birth control and anti-rabies vaccination programmes. There is also a need to conduct awareness campaigns for villagers,” she said.

Apart from this, the loans given under the emergency credit line guarantee (ECLG) scheme also be combined with the existing loans and this be restructured to be paid in instalments over three to four years.

There is uncertainty in the industrial scenario with payments getting delayed and raw materials becoming difficult to source, said S Surulivel, president of Railway Suppliers Association (RASA) and a coordinator of Federation of Coimbatore Industrial Associations (Focia). “The initial loan moratorium announced for the industry would end on August 31. Due to the pandemic crisis, we would be unable to pay our dues,” he said.

He sought that the moratorium be extended by another four months.

Earlier, representatives of the Joint Council of the Industrial Associations of Coimbatore had appealed to the Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman that the loan moratorium be extended till March 31, 2021. In a recent online meeting on the impact of the lockdown on MSMEs, representatives said if they take up paying the dues for the loans they get now, they wouldn’t be able to use it for industry operations, and to create demand.

However, a section of industrialists said they had to wait till the month-end to see whether there were signs of revival in the situation, before seeking a moratorium. “We are wary whether banks would levy accrued interest for the moratorium period,” said an industry representative.

While Congress had given the call “Chalo Mallaram” in protest against the alleged murder of Dalit youth and Congress member Revuli Rajababu, the TRS had called for ‘ Chalo Mallaram ’ to clarify that it was not involved in the murder. It took some time for the police to bring the situation under control.

Terming CM K Chandrasekhar Rao as anti-Dalit , Telangana Congress president N Uttam Kumar Reddy on Sunday condemned the inaction by police in the case in Mallaram village. Uttam was speaking to reporters at Lingala Ghanpur Police Station where he was detained while he was on his way to participate in 'Chalo Mallaram' protest march organised by TPCC Scheduled Caste cell on Sunday. “A Dalit youth, Revuli Rajababu, was murdered at Mallaram village on July 6 allegedly by a local TRS leader and his goons. But the local police neither probed into the murder nor took any action against the culprits. We wanted to meet the family and the local authorities to seek justice for the Dalit youth. However, we were stopped from visiting Mallaram and taken into custody by the police,"" he said.

Uttam expressed concern over rising atrocities against Dalits since TRS came to power. “KCR came to power in 2014 and promised three acres of land for poor Dalit families, double bedroom houses and also assured them protection and prosperity. However, Dalits are being targeted almost on a daily basis under TRS rule,” he alleged.

He strongly condemned the arrest of CLP leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka and house arrest of MLAs D Sridhar Babu and Seethakka and illegal detention of hundreds of Congress leaders and workers in Karimnagar and Bhupalpally.

This past week, reports of the viral infection have come in from almost all localities in the district and people from all age groups have contracted the virus.While the number of cases among those aged 51 years or more has shown a significant increase, health officials are concerned about the rise in the cases among the youths and middle-aged people too.On July 21, the 21-50 years age-group had 1,682 patients. However, by July 24, the number in this category had shot up to 2,192. This means, in just four days 510 new Covid-positive patients were identified in this age group, which translates to a 30% increase.Health officials blame this recent spike on apathy among the youth and middle-aged people, who are inclined to go out of their houses for some reason or other, without strictly following social distancing and mask-wearing norms.Health officials are also concerned because more children in the age group of 1-10 years are also testing positive. Official data reveals that the Kolhapur district had 143 patients in the said category on July 21. But the number increased to 196 by July 24. As many 53 children had tested positive during this duration, indicating a 37% spike.The number positive cases has also increased in the 51-70 years and 71 years+ categories. However, health officials maintain that a rise in these two categories is understandable as the majority of people in these age-groups have health issues. They said the patient numbers in these two categories are high because of house-to-house surveys carried out to identify vulnerable people.On July 21, the 51- 0 years age group had 560 positive cases and the number increased up to 759 on July 24. As many as 199 more patients were identified in four days. The number of cases in this age group increased by around 35 %.Official data shows that patients above 71 years increased by 42 % from July 21 to July 24.

158,['27/07/2020'],Pandemic effect: Sewing machine industry unable to come out of woods,"Ludhiana: It has been almost three months since factories were allowed to function, but sewing machine industry has still not been able to come on an even keel. A large number of manufacturers and traders are struggling to pay their electricity bills.

Industrialists said some of them were considering quitting the business and switching to some other sector. Following the lockdown, there was severe shortage of labour, drop in orders, delay in recovery of old payments from their buyers due to the inability of Ludhiana businessmen to tour other states.

Jagbir Sokhi, president of the Sewing Machine Development Club, said, “In most of the industrial sectors, the demand for products is picking up, but the only problem is shortage of labour. In our case, along with severe labour shortage we are also struggling to get new orders. The situation is such that some of the sewing machine parts’ manufacturing units, which have large power connections, are struggling even to pay their power bills. So, it’s a very complex situation and it looks obvious that the future of our industry is not bright. Therefore, a sizeable percentage of sewing machine industrialists is considering changing the trade.”

Amarjit Singh Swan, president of Ludhiana Sewing Machine Industries’ Association, said despite factories working for three months, their industry, for which the city is known worldwide, has not been able to return to normal. “There are some manufacturers who have orders and labour, but unfortunately no capital to run their businesses, as huge sums are stuck with their buyers for whom supplies were made before lockdown but their payments are still pending. One of the major reasons for delay in payments is the inability of businessmen to go to other states for recovery and finalise orders, which was otherwise a routine affair. Because of this, everyone, including the assemblers of sewing machines, traders and the machine parts’ manufacturers, are suffering.”

According to Jatinder Nagpal, finance secretary of Ludhiana Sewing Machine Industries’ Association, “Businessmen of the sector are feeling dejected and demoralised, and thinking of changing the line, as the prospects of this business picking up seem unlikely. Ludhiana is the biggest manufacturing and trading hub of sewing machines, so the state government must pay attention to our plight and help us come out of the current mess by either announcing a special relief package for the industry or help us get financial assistance from the Centre to manufacture high-end industrial sewing machines, which have a huge scope.”

159,['27/07/2020'],Ladhowal SHO suspended for inaction against mining mafia,"Times News Network

Ludhiana: The Ludhiana commissioner of police has suspended the SHO of Ladhowal police station, sub-inspector Balwinder Singh, for failing to act against the mining mafia.

A departmental inquiry has been marked against the SHO and no explanation was sought from him.

The action came a day after some people clicked and sent pictures to the police commissioner, Rakesh Agarwal, of machines mining in Ladhowal early on July 23.

Assistant commissioner of police (West) Gurpreet Singh said, “In the wee hours of July 23, a group of about 20 people reached a mining spot in Ladhowal, clicked pictures of Pockland machines present on the spot and sent those to the commissioner of police. It is alleged that the SHO did not act against the mining mafia in his jurisdiction. Therefore, the SHO has been suspended and a departmental inquiry initiated against him.”

The ACP added that nobody has been appointed as the new SHO of Ladhowal police station.

Sub-inspector Balwinder Singh had taken the charge in August 2019.

SHO Balwinder Singh said, “I have been trapped as I acted strictly against the mining mafia. I had arrested the main accused, who was wanted in 16 cases of illegal mining. That time, he had tried to pressurize me. He had made some influential people call me to release him, but I did not listen to anyone. The accused had also offered me a bribe of Rs 5 lakh. I turned down his offer and arrested him in all cases. He is behind the entire issue.”

“When I learned about illegal mining going on in the area early on July 23, I lodged an FIR and seized the vehicles. But I don’t know what happened after that. A day later, I was told that I have been suspended. The senior officials did not even seek any explanation from me. I believe it is a conspiracy against me hatched by the accused as I acted strictly in the matter,” the sub-inspector added.

The police have recovered a suicide note from the shop in which Naved, of Krishna Vihar on Tibba Road, has accused his brother’s wife of forcing him to take the extreme step.

Mustakeem Ahemd, Naved’s father, said, “My son, a tailor, had left for his shop at 1pm. When I went to his workplace, I found it bolted from inside. As my repeated knocks went unanswered, I called up my elder son Sahvej Saif. We broke open the shutter and found Naved hanging from the ceiling fan. At that time, Naved was alive.”

Naved died on way to a hospital.

Tibba police station SHO sub-inspector Daljit Singh said, “In a suicide note recovered from the shop, Naved has accused his sister-in-law Khushnuma of misbehaving with him and his family.

HYDERABAD: Claiming several engineering colleges were forcing teaching and non-teaching staff to attend paperwork during the pandemic, Telangana Technical Institutions Employees Association (TTIEA) members have requested officials to initiate action against those managements violating the Epidemics Diseases Act, 1897 and AICTE orders.

They said the managements were harassing staff and threatening to sack them if they fail to attend colleges. “The managements are harassing both teaching and non-teaching staff during the pandemic to attend college and do National Board of Accreditation (NBA) and National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) works. As per the government as well as AICTE orders, college should have been closed until July 31 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, colleges are threatening to withhold salaries or sack if anyone fails to attend colleges. To save their jobs, staff have no option except to follow management orders,” TTIEA president V Balakrishna Reddy said, adding about 50-60 engineering colleges in the state were forcing staff to attend work daily.

They alleged that colleges were taking zero precautions — no sanitisation, no temperature checks, no masks, no sanitisers, among others.

The college managements, meanwhile, said that it was not against norms to use the services of their faculty. “Colleges have the right to use the services of their staff, especially, when their accreditation will be reassessed this year. Autonomous colleges will lose their status if they fail to get their accreditation reassessed,” said KVK Rao, general secretary, All India Federation of Self-Financing Technical Institutions, adding that colleges were taking all precautions against Covid-19.

The police station would temporarily function out of a nearby marriage hall. The official said they would test about 30 police personnel from the station for Covid-19 on Monday.

According to the official, the new cases were reported from Selvapuram, Pollachi, Ramanathapuram, Singanallur, Ganapathy, Kuniyamuthur, Town Hall and Ukkadam, among other areas, in the district. There weren’t any imported cases on Sunday.

She was admitted to the hospital on Tuesday after she tested positive for the virus. She had eventually developed severe pneumonia.

The state is, however, yet to record two other Covid-19 deaths in the city in its bulletin.

The announcement was made during a press conference of district guardian minister Nitin Raut today.""All dedicated Covid hospital beds will be reserved only for Covid positive patients with symptoms, who are in a critical state,"" officials said.The move is likely to make several beds available at all three government hospitals — AIIMS, GMCH and IGGMCH — where all 1,200 beds are full right now. Health officials were unhappy over the NMC decision to admit all types of Covid patients despite them putting a strain on the civic body’s resources.

180,['27/07/2020'],Rajasthan: Mining could hit tiger corridor in Ranthambore,"Representative image

JAIPUR: The natural corridor for tigers at the Ranthambore National Park (RNP) is on the verge of destruction due to the proposed mining activity in close proximity of big cats’ habitat.

The activity has been proposed to supply raw materials for construction of the ambitious 1,250km Delhi-Mumbai Expressway project.

Three companies, which were given the work by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), have applied for 36 short term permits (STP) for mining in Sakhawada area, barely 100 metres from the buffer zone and falling on the crucial natural corridor junction between Ranthambore National Park (RNP), Ramgarh Vidhashri Tiger Sanctuary and Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve (MHTR).

A senior mining officer told TOI, “While one company has applied to grant 20 leases measuring 0.9-hectare area, the other two companies have applied for 10 and six leases of the same size. The total leases will cover mining activity in 324 hectares.”

As neither the mining department nor the firms have applied for NoCs, the forest department was caught unaware about the issue. Ranthambore Tiger Project field director Manoj Parashar said, “I am not aware about the exact location where the firms have applied for mining, since it’s outside the buffer area. However, if tiger movement is recorded in that area, we will intervene.”

Green activists fear that the move will destroy the habitat corridor between tiger reserves, which is an important means of maintaining these ecological processes and may hold the key to the survival and adaptation of the species. Moreover, the need for keeping tiger corridors undisturbed is required to facilitate free movement of big cats from RNP, where they are facing space crunch.

At present, the area is frequented by tiger T-110. Also, it has proved to be safe passage for many big cats including T-115, T-62, T-98, T-91.

Tapeshwar Singh Bhati of Mukundra Wildlife and Environment Society said, “Mining should not be allowed at this junction as it connects RNP with territorial forest of the Sultanpur region of Kota district and Ramgarh. Rajasthan recently created the MHTR and proposed to upgrade Ramgarh as tiger reserve for Ranthambore’s ‘spillover’ tigers. The corridor between the reserves should be strengthened and not destroyed. Finding space crunch, a young three-year-old tiger T-115 moved to Ramgarh.”

Near RNP, the expressway is also proposed to pass through the 22km stretch of Lakheri and Indargarh having tiger corridors. There is already some disturbance and space crunch in the area due to a railway line and existing four-lane highway. While environmentalists fear that the expressway project would cut through the tiger corridor in Sawai Madhpour district , making their dispersal a huge problem, forest officials claim a 3km tunnel and 5.5-metre underpasses are proposed, which will not disturb the movement, once the project is completed.

181,['27/07/2020'],HC disposes application against wedding event participants,"Auragnabad: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has disposed of a criminal application seeking action against people, including police officials and people’s representatives, who had gathered at a recent wedding reception organised by a high-profile resident of Gangakhed in Parbhani district. The petitioner had referred to newspaper clippings in support of his demand.

On July 21, the HC bench comprising Justices Ravindra V Ghuge and M G Sewlikar disposed of the Gangakhed resident’s application with liberty to approach the local authority. The bench heard this CA with another criminal application filed by an Amalner (Jalgaon district) resident along with a criminal suo motu public interest litigation.

Vinod Ashok Kharat had approached the HC through lawyer Y B Bolkar seeking intervention in the suo motu PIL being aggrieved by a wedding reception ceremony attended, among others, by “Several political representatives, people who are in the political arena and even by the revenue and police authorities, while praying for direction to take action against such violators who are the cause of the spread of Covid-19 pandemic.”

Another criminal application was filed by Jyoti Dhanraj Bhoi through lawyer B R Waramaa, stating that the municipal council, Amalner, has not been sanitised even once. That the local administration has hardly shown any concern towards the residents. And also, that the chief officer of Amalner Municipal Council has not shown any sensitivity and there is laxity on the part of the council administration. This is the root cause of the growth of Covid-19 patients in the area and the situation is going from bad to worse.”

In this matter, the high court issued notices to several authorities concerned including the Jalgaon district collector, the superintendent of police and others returnable on August 4, when this would be heard along with the original suo-motu PIL.

The court has also directed: “In the meanwhile, without indicating that we have accepted the contention of the applicant in this application as gospel truth without hearing the respondents, we are directing respondents No. 42, 43, 44 and 46 to ensure that appropriate steps for the santisation of the area under the Amalner Municipal Council are taken and, we expect the report of compliance on the next date of hearing.”

The court also made it clear that this application (Amlner) was being entertained only to ensure that “residents of such villages or municipal councils or talukas are not required to individually approach this Court with such applications. We are, therefore, making this direction applicable to all such places falling under the various districts amenable to the jurisdiction of this Bench in the interest of the public at large.”

Senior counsel Rajendra Deshmukh, who was appointed amicus curiae by the HC in its criminal public interest litigation drew attention of the court toward private hospitals charging excessive fee for treatment of Covid 19. While referring to the earlier HC orders passed in this suo moto PIL, Deshmukh asserted the need for more action on the part of the respective district administrations to check private hospitals charging huge amounts for treatment of Covid 19.

While placing the next date on August 4, Justices Ghuge and Swelikar observed: “We also deem it appropriate to direct that the local administration under the District Collectors of the districts, as head of such administration, should ensure that the list of private hospitals which are being utilised for COVID-19 patients’ treatment should be given a wide publicity and the administration should ensure that such private hospitals which have been declared as COVID-19 treatment hospitals, should implement the directions of the district administration in letters and spirit.”

183,['27/07/2020'],Brothers booked for blocking house sale,"Ahmedabad: A complaint of criminal intimidation was filed against three builders by a man who says they are obstructing the sale of his house. The builders are Babakhan Pathan and his brothers Mehboobkhan Pathan and Sharifkhan Pathan of Shah-e-Alam. The complaint was filed on Saturday by Sabirhusain Luhar of Memon Chawl in the same area.

Police have filed a case under Section 294 (b) of the Indian Penal Code for uttering obscenities and under Section 506 (2) for criminal intimidation. According to the FIR lodged by Luhar, who hails from Indore, the three brothers live opposite his house. Luhar said that Babakhan has a long criminal history.

Luhar said that he wants to sell his house but because people fear the three brothers, nobody is stepping forward. He said that Babakhan was accused in a murder case in 2011 but was later acquitted. Luhar stated in his complaint that on the night of July 24, Sharifkhan’s men came to his house and took him to the office of Nawab Builders in the Shah-e-Alam area. According to the FIR, the three brothers were present at the office.

Luhar said that the brothers asked him if he wanted to sell his house. He said he then replied that because of them no one dares to buy it.

The brothers were incensed and started abusing Luhar. Luhar said in the FIR that Sharifkhan told him that he would fix him in a false case while Babakhan abused him. Inspector J M Solanki of the Isanpur police station said that following the complaint cops searched for the accused but couldn’t find them.

Bakrid this year falls on August 1.

Jamia Nizamia VC Mufti Khaleel Ahmed, who issued the fatwa (religious decree), said in Islamic jurisprudence there is no alternative to sacrificing sheep on the day of Bakrid or the following two days. But if one is not able to offer sacrifice on the prescribed three days in view of the Covid-19 situation, he or she should donate money equivalent to the cost of the sacrificial animal to the poor. The Mufti, however, added that one should explore all possibilities to sacrifice sheep on Bakrid or on the following two days. “The money should be donated to the poor only two days after the Bakrid,” he said.

As many areas in Telangana and AP are reeling under Covid-19, it is better to take all precautions to ensure that the virus is not transmitted during the ritual of sacrifice. “Human life is precious and it should be safeguarded at any cost by following pandemic norms prescribed by local governments. One should not put one’s life or lives of others in danger,” he said.

Referring to the demolition of two mosques in Telangana secretariat , Mufti Khaleel Ahmed said the mosques should be reconstructed on their exact sites. Construction of one big mosque in lieu of the two, is not acceptable. The Mufti said Muslim leaders should explore all legal and constitutional possibilities to ensure the demolished mosques are reconstructed at their original sites. The two mosques on the secretariat premises were built in princely state of Hyderabad more than a century ago. The state government demolished them as part of reconstruction of secretariat.

JAISALMER: Students of Adarsh Vidhya Mandir of Chodia village in Jaisalmer saved a baby rabbit from wild dogs and later brought it to their house.

Sangaram and Raipal, students classes V and VI, were looking after the rabbit for last 21 days and had named it Jojo. They even made a house for it.

They later handed over the baby rabbit to Desert National Park’s deputy forest officer Kapil Chandrawal. The DFP boosted the morale of the children and gave certificates to them. He later sent the baby rabbit to the veterinary medical officer.

Besides, the Desert National Park has also increased the security of GIBs to save them from stray dogs and other wild animals.

The measure comes after an eagle attacked a Great Indian Bustard and killed it in Ramdeora area. Moreover, dozens of wild dogs have been caught and released in far off places to protect other animals including GIB. The department has repaired the fencing in the closure for protection of GIB. Along with, patrolling has been increased.

DNP, spread over 3,162sq km in Jaisalmer and Barmer districts, is a habitat for GIB.

For the first time in three decades, a GIB has been killed by an eagle. There were around 1,500 GIBs five decades ago, but now their number is around 150. Highest number of GIBs are in DNP, numbering less than 40. In the census recently, only 19 GIBs were sighted. Wildlife enthusiast Radheyshyam Pemani said that for the conservation of GIBs, closures have been made in DNP. Most of the GIBs remain in the closure, while a few roam outside the DNP area, especially in Khetolai and field firing range area. They face threat from dogs and pigs in these areas.

192,['27/07/2020'],Apple season at stake in Kullu: Assn,"Manali: Amid the restlessness of tourism traders of Himachal Pradesh over no business for four months, now the apple growers of the state have reasons to worry as their efforts to ensure a hassle-free harvesting season during the Covid-19 pandemic have failed to yield the desired results. The growers in Kullu are spending sleepless nights as they are not able to bring labourers due to the pandemic constraints. Most of them are hesitating in applying for permits to bring labourers, as they will have to take responsibility of keeping them in quarantine before deploying at work. In some villages, the growers are still undecided whether they should take the risk of giving access to outsiders for apple work, given the fear of spread of the disease.Of the required thousands of workers, including harvesters, fruit carriers and packaging experts, less than 5% workforce has been brought from other states so far. Nepalese labourers are the first choice of the growers, as they have expertise in working in hilly terrains and transporting heavy fruits on steep trails. But, the India-Nepal controversy and the strict Covid-19 norms are the roadblocks. In this backdrop, most of the orchardists are betting on labourers from UP, Bihar and other states, who have no experience in this work.Apple is the main source of livelihood for most people of Himachal and is the main contributor to the state’s economy.Yuvraj Bhardwaj, an orchardist, who tried bringing labourers from Lakhimpur in UP, said he had no idea that he needed a prior permission from the local administration to bring outsiders. “I booked a tempo for Rs 65,000 to bring 14 labourers from Lakhimpur. Now I’ve stopped them mid-way. I could not get the permit on Saturday. I’ll try on Monday again. If it doesn’t work, I will send them back,” he said.Growers are demanding a single-window permit system for the growers. Apple buyers from other states have also arrived in limited numbers. Growers want the government to make the necessary arrangements for the buyers’ arrival, so that they could get better price for their harvest. Kullu Fruit Growers Association general secretary Rajiv Thakur said, “Keeping labourers in quarantine by growers is the main problem. They want the government to keep them in quarantine centres under strict checks and their Covid-19 test should be done before they leave the centre.”",chandigarh,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/apple-season-at-stake-in-kullu-assn/articleshow/77188057.cms

Three weeks later, his condition improved and he was moved out of the intensive care unit (ICU). He continued to receive treatment for another two weeks and was finally discharged when his results improved. Through the process, the employee also had to battle the mental trauma that set in five days after he was admitted to the hospital.

He shared, “I had not seen my wife, sons and grandsons for five weeks. The doctors, who treated me, were in PPE kits. They felt like aliens to me after a point. I did not have my mobile phone. The doctors would occasionally let me do a video call with my family. Slowly, being in the hospital became very traumatic for me. I would almost shout at the staff to move me out of the hospital and send me home. After the ICU, I was in an isolation ward. I would feel so lonely. It was very traumatic.”

Head of the Isolation ICU at Ruby Hall Clinic Kapil Zirpe explained that patients admitted to ICU undergo such problems. “In addition, they’re dealing with the treatment and are constantly on medication. The doctors’ consolation hardly seems to matter. We have, therefore, enhanced our post-recovery care for patients by way of consultation and explaining to the family on extending the right support to patients,” he said.

Dr Pradeep D’Costa, ICU head at KEM Hospital Pune, added, “When patients are discharged, a list of dos and dont's is given to them. Those with comorbidities get a more elaborate prescription. We also advise them to avoid dusty places and people suffering from any illness.”

200,['27/07/2020'],KCB’s temporary nod to shop operations over weekends,"Pune: Effective crowd management at the busiest Khadki bazaar area in the last three days is likely to influence the Khadki Cantonment Board’s (KCB) decision of allowing shops to remain open on Friday, Saturday and Sunday in the future, KCB chief executive officer Pramod Kumar Singh said.

The cantonment board had allowed all shops to open on these days in its order issued on July 23.

“The shopkeepers and traders were not happy with our previous P1 and P2 model. They had requested us to let them operate on these three days to attract weekend crowd. We have agreed to their proposal for now. In the last three days, we witnessed good crowd management outside the shops in the bazaar area. Social distancing norms were being strictly followed. If the same scenario continues, we may let the traders operate on all days,” Singh told TOI.

The Khadki bazaar area had recorded around 100 positive cases in the last three weeks. As many as six localities in its vicinity had been identified as micro-containment zones by the cantonment board.

“Our health staffers will carry out intensive testing of citizens living in and around bazaar areas on the days the market is shut. We have demanded 500 antigen kits for carrying out rapid testing,” Singh added.

“The Khadki bazaar area is highly congested andthe population density is also high compared to the other parts of Khadki. As a result, we have to take extra precautions to contain further spread. We have taken help from locals for various works,” a senior cantonment board official said.

For this, the health department team and civil defence employees on Sunday jointly organised a two-day camp under Nagfani police station, where rapid antigen tests were conducted. The test – used to quickly obtain a diagnostic result – was conducted in the city and 145 people underwent the checkup, out of which five tested positive for the virus.

Moradabad chief medical officer (CMO) Dr MC Garg said, “With a consistent hike in Covid-19 cases in the district, we have increased the frequency of testing. To ensure that maximum people can undergo tests, a two-day rapid antigen detection test camp has been organised by the health department. On the first day, close to 140 people – including adults, old-aged and children – were examined and of these, five people were found to be Covid-19 positive.”

Officials and workers of the health department deputed at the camp organized near Chaurasi Ghanta temple in the Nagfani area said that those who tested positive, between ages two to 39, have been admitted to a private hospital. A target to check around 250 people per day has been set.

A civil defense employee Ashish Chandra Trivedi said, “While most people are voluntarily coming up to get themselves checked, the team members are also individually reaching out to families to inform them about the camp so that they can get tested. The camp will be set up on Monday as well.”

“The rapid antigen detection test for Covid-19 is used to quickly obtain a diagnostic result. Through the rapid antigen testing, a positive or negative result for Covid-19 testing is interpreted within 30 minutes. The health department will continue to organise similar camps in various parts of the city – especially in containment zones – irrespective of the weekend lockdown,” Garg added.

Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) had received over 1.75 lakh applications as part of the Layout Regulation Scheme (LRS) offered in 2016 and ended in January 2020 after a series of extensions of last date. Of the total, the HMDA rejected over 20,000 applications stating that the plots were located either in full tank level area of various water bodies or were involved in some dispute or the other or the land belonged to Waqf board and endowments department among other reasons.

The plot owners had paid a minimum Rs 10,000 deposit while submitting the applications. The plot owners were shocked when they were told that their money would not be refunded. “How can HMDA say it will not return our money when our applications have been rejected? We are already suffering with financial losses due to lockdowns,” said a plot owner.

Another plot owner urged chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to intervene and direct the HMDA to refund their deposits . However, HMDA officials said they cannot refund the money. “The initial payment made by the applicants is a deemed fee towards processing of applications, inspecting the sites and rejecting their applications.

205,['27/07/2020'],Hyderabad: VIP tantrums add to govt hospitals’ chaos,"Picture for representational purpose only.

HYDERABAD: Piping hot Irani chai, hot water at regular intervals and the best bed, preferably beside a window with a view. These are just a few of a plethora of demands put forth by ‘VIPs’ at government hospitals treating Covid-19 patients across the state. Unable to put up with these unreasonable demands, hospital staff are quitting in droves.

“I want hot water to be served every two hours. Otherwise, you will see...you don’t know who I am,” screamed a Covid-19 patient, admitted to a government hospital, to doctors and other staff attending on the person. Except Gandhi Hospital to an extent, many government treatment centres were facing the ‘VIP’ temblors of supposedly well-connected patients.

Doctors in private conversations with TOI told that many patients, especially those having links with politicians or those in power, have been putting forth unreasonable demands unmindful of the pandemic and severe manpower crisis. “Though there are beds, we don’t have enough staff as they are working in shifts or in isolation, by turns. These people don’t even follow Covid norms and stay near their bed. They loiter all over the the place. If we advise them, they take it causally,” a staff at Nature Cure Hospital said.

Apart from their ever-expanding list of demands, they insist on longer stay at the hospital despite symptoms subsiding or turning negative. “I can call your higher-ups and complain against you if you don’t attend,” is the oft-quoted threat they use to pressurize staff to give to their demands.

Some even don’t hesitate to misbehave with lower-level cadre, sources said. “They attack doctors, both with words and deeds. They are influential people, but the lower-rung staff, who actually go to the patient to give medicine, do check-up and attend on them don’t even even get acknowledged for their service. Some talk to them rudely, which demoralises us,” K Srilatha (name changed ), an attendant at a government facility, said.

Rude behaviour by patients related to VIPs was also one of the reasons many outsourcing staff were quitting their jobs. At some hospitals, including Gandhi, many outsourcing nurses have resigned, sources said.

HYDERABAD: Residents of Rajendra Reddy Nagar Colony (RRNC), Chandanagar, on Sunday protested against the construction of a structure on an open land in their locality by a group of unidentified persons.

They alleged that some people, over a period of years, fabricated documents with fake signatures and tried to grab two pieces of land measuring one acre and 1,800 square yards, respectively.

“We are protecting the parks in our locality with the help of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), but a week ago, the encroachers barricaded the park and began construction work in the parks,” said a protester.

Around 50 residents gathered in front of the open spaces with placards and raised slogans of ‘Save parks- we want justice.’ The protesters also tied a flex banner on the barricaded site and slammed the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) officials for granting permission for construction to the encroachers. “How can GHMC grant permission when the land is marked as a park,” questioned a member of Rajendra Nagar Welfare Association.

Another resident said that land grabbers took advantage of the pandemic and lockdown. “GHMC gave a letter in 2019 which clearly states the land belongs to the corporation, irony is that the same corporation approved fake layouts under Layout Regularisation Scheme (LRS),” said another protester who accused the GHMC officials of corruption.

“Not even one person from Rajendra Reddy Nagar Colony called me up today and complained about the encroachment. The park will be inspected on Monday,” said N Sudhamsh, who took charge as GHMC deputy commissioner of Serilingampally a couple of months ago.

The price of the two pieces of land is said to be worth crores o rupees, according to sources.

Rajender Reddy Nagar Colony was developed on a parcel of land spread over 19 acre 20 guntas as per the draft layout of the HUDA.

One of them told him that they had come to check for evil spirits in his and the neighbouring bungalows and asked him to open the door. When the man asked the trio how they came to know about it, they told him that it had become a frequent occurrence on Ferguson College Road, Prabhat Road and even BMCC Road. When he did not open the door for half-an-hour, they left on two motorcycles.

215,['27/07/2020'],"Kolkata Containment Zones: 15 high-rises, two slums on list of 31 containment zones","(With inputs from Tamaghna Banerjee)

KOLKATA: Apartments — both stand-alone buildings and complexes — account for 15 of Kolkata’s 31 containment zones. Slums constitute two containment zones on the list and the rest are mixed occupancies. According to police sources , almost 50% of all Covid cases reported in the first 25 days in July are from apartments.In south Kolkata, Bhowanipore has four containment zones. All of them are complexes. All four containment zones in Alipore, too, are complexes.Cops said several more complexes, which are not in the containment list now, have reported fresh Covid cases.“At least two complexes, one in Jodhpur Park and another in Ballygunge, have reported fresh infections after they allowed domestic helps and support staff to their homes. These support staff usually came from local neighbourhoods, which had some Covid cases,” said a KMC health department officer .Police and KMC believe that the reason for the rise has everything to do with the unlockdown period. “Complexes that were initially keeping their premises locked up, have now let their guard down, with many allowing visitors and house help,” said an officer.“An entire complex in Bhowanipore is now under containment after six of its inhabitants in the servant quarters developed Covid,” said a south-division officer.Also, with offices resuming, many residents are travelling to work every day. Residents are also getting out for non-essential activities, officials said, pointing to the huge rush at markets on both Friday and again on Sunday.KMC and police said Kolkata’s problem is not unique. Across cities, the trend is the same. Sources pointed out last month in Mumbai, the number of new Covid-19 cases being reported from residential buildings and high-rises had seen 108% increase, while slums and other congested areas have reported 60% jump, the Mumbai civic body reported recently. In Delhi, a huge percentage of containment zones are apartments.The bigger complexes have already introduced multiple steps realizing the needs of the day. At South City, e-commerce delivery personnel and those delivering food were allowed inside only after their temperature was checked. Even then, they could go till the reception area.“Residents were asked to collect their belongings from the reception later. Residents with medical emergencies and in the medical profession had no restriction on movements,” said Manak Daga, president of the residents’ association.Many complexes had also asked their facility management staff to stay back on the campuses. Residents are pooling in funds for the additional cost.Both KMC and police have drawn up timetables, which they are following each day to reach maximum apartments, especially those in the containment zones.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77189076,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-365048,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/15-high-rises-2-slums-on-list-of-31-containment-zones/articleshow/77188071.cms

Lucknow Development Authority has decided to hire a private agency for door-to-door and roadside garbage collection in the two areas with over 10,000 households. Residents will have to pay a user charge of Rs 20 per month to avail the facility.

At present, people in the two localities have hired private agencies on their own for garbage disposal as no facility was provided by LDA since inception.

“The state government had directed in December to transfer these localities from under LDA’s jurisdiction to LMC so that residents can get civic amenities. However, the transfer process is taking time, hence we have decided to hire a private agency for garbage collection and disposal,” said LDA chief engineer Indu Shekhar Singh.

218,['27/07/2020'],Ludh to get 24/7 canal-based water supply project,"Ludhiana: With cabinet approval to 24/7 canal-based water supply project in Amritsar and Ludhiana, the industrial city is finally getting its most awaited project that has been hanging fire for over a decade.

Even if there is political will right now, this World Bank-funded project is still likely to have a bumpy ride ahead, as it comes with certain conditions attached.

The one that is most likely to cause a problem, considering first the urban local bodies and then the assembly elections 2022 are about to be played out, is the condition of the World Bank that rates are revised. For, according to the revised rates, exemption that was given to consumers living in houses up to 125 square yards of land has been taken away and only single-storey 50 square yards residential properties will get an exemption from the water tariff while rest will have to pay the bills. This will not curry favour with the residents definitely and with race for assembly elections likely to start in 2021, it is to be seen how far political will persist.

Then there is the condition that water tariffs should be increased on slab rates basis instead of flat rates. This will be a logistical nightmare for the civic body as well as state government, as it would involve meter reading.

Already, one could see how this is going to to play out. The civic body said it has already sent a draft of revised water tariff rates to the state government for implementation, but no decision has been taken over it. The sources said government has to notify this draft so that it could be implemented, but due to the upcoming elections in 162 urban local bodies, the notification is put on hold.

The committee had even proposed that from April 1, all new water supply connections should be metered ones, but since the draft is not implemented yet, this could not be implemented in the city.

Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu, however, said, “This project is important for the city as ground water is depleting really fast. The cabinet has approved the project for the city and now we will go ahead with the process to acquire land for water treatment plants are to be installed in phase 1.” He however said as far as revised water tariff and meters are concerned, the decision has to be taken at state government level.

Additional commissioner of municipal council Sanyam Aggarwal said, “There is no major formality left on our side as now process to acquire the land will take one and half months after which tenders will be floated. Amritsar has acquired the land already.” He said the first phase of the project is likely to go smoothly as it involves construction of water treatment plant, but in the second phase when they will start digging the city for laying water supply lines, there will be difficulties. According to him, they have a three-year deadline to complete the project. “It is the most important project for Ludhiana so government is considering it a priority,” he added.

On a lazy Sunday ‘quarantine-at-home’ day, when most stayed indoors, he took advantage of the empty roads and biked around the city planting saplings grown from the trees planted by his father.

“My papa, Mohinder Singh, who passed away in 2012, had planted a mulberry tree outside our workplace. From its fruits the seeds sprout and new plants grow. I had placed those tiny saplings into polybags for them to grow. After around two years, these plants are ready for re-plantation. Thought of planting these on my favorite riding route, starting from Jodhan Sarabha bridge up to bridge near Jassowal to Kila Raipur, where I can watch them growing and can take care of them too,” said Hapreet Singh, a businessman from Dugri Phase Two. “Today morning I started from one end and returned home after covering nearly 45km. Along the way, I ventured into new kutcha paths along the fields and can say today definitely was lovely day for cycling.” He added that he does grow fruits and vegetables at home and has deep love for nature.

The cyclist, who holds the distinction of participating in MTB Shimla for four consecutive years from 2014, said during lockdown when he couldn’t go for cycling he really missed the activity. He advocated that cycling being an immunity buster as well as a good de-stressing exercise, more people should take it up during this time.

Recalling his journey, Harpreet said when he was in the third standard, he had a bet with his father that if he topped in examination in his class he would have to get him a bicycle. “That was the beginning of my love for bicycles and cycling. These days I love to bike through countryside.”

“Mostly, I go alone. However, on Sundays I do go for cycling with some friends,” said Harpreet.

Though this parameter indicates the spread of the infection is still lower than the national average, this index is climbing up sharply over the past few weeks. Currently, the positivity rate in the state has crossed 7% mark. Health experts said this rate could go up as high as 10% in the next few weeks. The national positivity rate currently is about 12%.

“Test positivity rate is the percentage of people, who are found infected out of all the samples tested, indicating the spread of the infection. We are not conducting enough tests and there is no sign of awareness among people on obeying preventive norms. Hence, we will see further rise,” said associate professor Sumon Poddar Institute of Child health, also in-charge of molecular biology wing of the hospital.

The positivity rate had gone down as low as 2.7% in June beginning. But it climbed up steadily to stand at 3.8% by June end. But with daily new cases crossing 2,000 in the past nine days, it has now shot up to 7.3%. The government has scaled up the number of test a little over by 16,000 on Monday.

“Earlier, we were citing about lower denomination for the higher positivity rate. Now, the state has scaled up tests to a reasonable number if not the ideal mark, therefore the lower denomination is no longer an excuse. The infection is spreading fast and number will continue to rise exponentially. We can only hope for the virus to lose its virulence gradually, a vaccine or herd immunity,” said infectious disease control specialist Debkishore Gupta of CMRI.

The hospital bed occupancy rate across the state was as low as 19% in June beginning. It grew to 23% in July beginning and touched 42% on Sunday. On Sunday, the state clinical establishment commission chairperson justice (retd) Ashim Kumar Banerjee said there should be facilities for home collection and walk-in test kiosks but for that the private sector must improve manpower and infrastructure .

Lucknow: When it comes to taking on aggressors intruding into the Indian territory, harsh weather and shortage of food and water are no deterrents for bravehearts fighting for the country.

Recalling how Indian soldiers routed Pakistani infiltrators during Kargil War, Brigadier (retired) Amul Asthana who led the 1st battalion of the 11 Gorkha Rifles which launched the final attack for the capture of Tekri Post on the Line of Control on July 26, 1999, said: “We were short of food and the water we had was contaminated with gunpowder. Our soldiers drank melted snow and fell ill but still they were high on ‘Josh’ (zeal) to make ‘Operation Vijay’ a success.”

Brig Asthana shared his experience of the Kargil War on Sunday during an online session organized by the Avadh Girls’ Degree College on the occasion 21st Kargil Vijay Diwas.

“On May 6, we were informed that 4-5 infiltrators have entered the Batalik mountain – a focal point in Kargil War because of its strategic location between Kargil and Leh. We walked nonstop for 9 hours and covered 7000ft to hunt down enemies. However, we found that they were not just 4-5 but 400-500 men firing on us from all the directions,” said Brig Asthana.

“The very moment we realized that it was not a small operation but a prolonged war. This was the time when young officers like Lieutenant Samiran Roy, Captain Manoj Pandey and Lt RS Rawat fought bravely for the country,” he said.

The battalion, led by Colonel Lalit Rai, fought valiantly and Captain Manoj Pandey sacrificed his life after destroying several enemy bunkers.

“‘Na chhodna’ (Don’t spare them) were the last words of Captain Pandey. We captured Khalubar but didn’t have an Indian flag to hoist. I kept a diary in my pocket with the Indian flag that was hoisted after capturing the post,” he said. “The war was on and we had little water and that too was contaminated with gunpowder. Soldiers drank melted ice and fell ill but fought and killed enemies. We surprised the enemy at point 5287 (17,600 feet) and the Gorkha soldiers killed them with ‘kukri’ (machete). A soldier immediately told me on radio that he has found a diary of a Pakistani army officer written in English and is dated. I asked him to open the page marked May 27. The message, ‘We have shot down an Indian MiG’, was written on it. I got to know it was a double victory for us as the infiltrators whom we killed had martyred our Squadron Leader Ajay Ahuja by shooting down his MiG,” he recalled. He also showed a rare picture of celebration of Gorkha Soldiers at Point 5287 in which Indian soldiers were seen posing with stinger missiles they recovered from that place.

Talking to TOI, Brig Asthana said not just soldiers but even a retired armymen and soldier’s wife also helped them. “I somehow sent a message to my wife in Delhi that we need a magneto (military) telephone. Reacting swiftly, she went to Chandni Chowk and sent 14 phones to us. Wives of many soldiers also made their contributions during the Kargil War from wherever they were.”

229,['27/07/2020'],Monsoon takes a toll on antelopes,"JODHPUR: Monsoon has started taking its toll on wildlife, especially the antelopes in the desert region.

The marshy land in the aftermath of rain in the habitat of chinkaras and black bucks has turned life threatening for them as they are increasingly falling prey to stray dogs.

Over 100 chinkaras and black bucks have been attacked by stray dogs in Jodhpur district and its vicinity in the last two days coinciding with the advent of the monsoon showers in the region.

According to sources, about two dozen of these have succumbed to dog bites in the last three days, while the rest are under treatment at different rescue centres. TOI tried to talk to forest officials, but DCF (Wildlife) Mahesh Choudhary was out of town and in-charge of the rescue centre Ashokaram Panwar had his phone switched off, even in such a critical situation, when the villagers have been rushing with injured animals.Wildlife lovers and environmentalists have been demanding control on stray dogs and effective rescue activities for the antelopes since long, but no step has been taken to ensure safety of these antelopes, especially during monsoon.

President of Bishnoi Tiger Force Rampal Bhawad said the soil turns soft during monsoon and antelopes could not hop and run as swiftly as they do otherwise. “Hence they fall easy prey to the stray dogs. Some are badly injured and some are lucky to be rescued by villagers,” he said.

Bishnoi Tiger Force had demanded that the government provide them land in the villages and help them catch stray dogs to be kept there for sterilisation, but this demand stands unheeded.

Besides, barbed fence wires around agriculture farms are also a major threat for these scampering antelopes in the rural areas. “While running across the farms in the villages, especially in order to protect themselves from the chasing dogs, they get hit by the barbed wire fences and die of injuries,” said senior veterinarian Shravan Singh Rathore.

The situation has further worsened by the lack of staff and resources to rescue these endangered antelopes. None of the three veterinary rescue centres in Jodhpur, Phalodi and Khejarli has permanent veterinarian. “Given the limited resources available with the department, the ratio of saving the antelopes was quite low,” admitted a forest official.

230,['27/07/2020'],Gujarat: Rannotsav to be held from mid-November,"Rannotsav is held every year from November to February

AHMEDABAD: Craving for a getaway in 2020? Well, the state government will soon add some silver lining to the hopes of travellers! Gujarat ’s signature tourism festival, Rannotsav , which is held every year from November to February, will be held this year too. At a time when tourism industry has seen a drastic decline in bookings, the state government is all geared up to host the festival, revealed sources, from mid-November onwards till February-end.

“The government will soon make an official announcement about the festival which is expected to begin in mid-November and bookings will shortly open. The tent city is being readied to welcome tourists under a new normal and we are taking all precautions to ensure social distancing and utmost hygiene is maintained. We are also reorganizing the dining space, where more people congregate and spacing it out and have deployed additional buses which will only ferry tourists at half the capacity or less,” said Nikhil Aggarwal, partner of the event management company which organizes Rannotsav.

The annual festival attracted at least 50,000 tourists last season, including people from Gujarat and other parts of India, NRIs who visit their home state during the winter months and even a few foreign nationals. The organizers have slashed package prices to woo tourists. “We have reduced the package price across categories by 20% to encourage more tourists to visit the festival. We have not reduced itinerary but have worked on ensuring social distancing and safety of tourists in the wake of the pandemic,” said Aggarwal.

Industry sources, however, said the footfall may take a hit by at least 30% in the wake of the pandemic and even a likely reduction in number of international travellers. Tour operators however, feel that the decision to hold the festival will help revive tourism in the state.

“People from Gujarat have not stepped out to travel anywhere since summer and this has happened for the first time. Travellers will think twice before making holiday plans to other states because of quarantine rules. Thus, Rannotsav is a fantastic opportunity for tourists to drive down and take a getaway within the state itself,” said Manish Sharma, secretary, Travel Agents’ Federation of India (TAFI) – Gujarat chapter.

“While the government and its executing agencies will ensure all precautions, it is still four months to the festival and if the cases go down by then, there is a lot of scope for improving tourism in the state,” he added.

NASHIK: Nashik municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game on Sunday appointed independent auditors at 32 private hospitals treating Covid-19 patients in the city to put a stop to overcharging.

Game also directed the auditors to lodge FIR against private hospitals if they are found inflating bills.

The auditors have been tasked with sitting at the the said hospitals throughout the day or during official hours and check the bills before handing them over to Covid-19 patients at the time of discharge.

The auditor concerned will verify the bill and check if the patient is charged nominally. If not, he will make the necessary changes in the bill. If the private hospital concerned refuses to reduce the inflated bill, the auditor concerned will lodge an FIR.

The municipal commissioner has issued a circular in this connection. The circular also includes the list of auditors.“As per the new circular by the municipal commissioner, it will be mandatory for private hospitals to inspect the bills through the auditor appointed at the hospital. The bills are to be given to the patients concerned only after the auditor approves them,” said NMC officials.

232,['27/07/2020'],Students seek extension of deadline to submit docus,"Pune: The lockdown situation has left parents and students clueless about collecting the required certificates for admission to first year junior colleges (FYJC, Std XI) even as the process started on Sunday.

Teachers’ associations along with parents and students have demanded an extension of the deadline for submission of documents, such as non-creamy layer certificate, caste certificate and income certificate.

Manisha Kale, parent of a city-based student applying for admission to FYJC, said, “We have submitted an application for the caste certificate but we have not received it yet. We have informed the school about the situation but the authorities did not have any idea about how to go about the process without a copy of the certificate.”

The Maharashtra Teachers Sena has also written to state education minister Varsha Gaikwad on Friday. The association has demanded an extension in the deadline for the submission.

Sunil Jagtap, coordinator of the association, said, “The FYJC forms have options for these categories, where students have to make it clear if they are eligible for the benefits provided under any of these categories. After we submitted the letter to the deputy director of education in Pune as well as the state education minister, we were told that a decision would be taken on the same soon.”

The form filling exercise for FYJC began on Sunday. However, as of now, students will only be able to register in order to get the login id and password.

The submission of the students’ personal details will begin from August 1 as the education department has been considering the changes that are to be incorporated in the forms with respect to submission of additional documents.

Deputy director of education for Pune division Meena Shendkar pointed out that the department has received a number of letters from students, parents and associations. These were studied and they were sent to the state education department, Shendkar stated.

“The current system had the option of uploading documents to support the student’s selection of non-creamy layer category, caste validity, or other such certificates. If these documents were not uploaded, then the student would be considered in the general category. To avoid this as well as to make changes in the system, we have extended the actual form-filling process until August 1. For now, students can register and create their login id and passwords,” said Shendkar.

233,['27/07/2020'],Udaipur: Aadhaar-like UID for bovines now,"The move will help farmers to better manage their livestock

UDAIPUR: The animal husbandry department has embarked on an ambitious project of issuing 12-digit barcoded ear tags to identify, register and track cattle population.

Each animal will be provided a thermoplastic polyurethane ear tag bearing 12-digit UID. Like Aadhaar cards for humans, the Pashu Aadhaar scheme has been launched with an aim of enhancing traceability of livestock and their products, such as milk or meat. It is being touted as the world’s largest existing database of animals. “The scheme would help farmers and animal husbandry officials devise better strategies to manage livestock in the country. Pashu Aadhaar assigns a unique identification number to each animal, alongside a host of other related data that will help in managing the country’s vast livestock resources,” said Bhupendra Bharadwaj , deputy director, animal husbandry department.

The project is being carried out under the Information Network for Animal Productivity and Health (INAPH) which has been developed by the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB).

“We have received ear tags and some 400 employees of the department are working on the onerous task to cover the huge bovine population in Udaipur . The tags would contain data on the bovines’ species, breed, pedigree, and information related to calving, artificial insemination, milk production, feeding, nutrition history and vaccination,” Bharadwaj said.

All indigenous, nondescript, crossbred as well as exotic milch animals above the age of four months are being covered for the database. “The database would help veterinarians to deliver better health services to the cattle owners. The vaccinations, deworming and disease testing services are provided to the animals at regular intervals. These intervals are configured in the system based on parameters like disease, age, etc., which alerts the veterinarians to take appropriate action at appropriate time. The complete case history of the treatment services provided on an animal would also be maintained and available to the veterinarians on finger tips for better diagnosis and treatment of the animal. First information report on outbreak and its follow-up can also be recorded along with provision to send alerts to the affected areas,” Dr Shakti Singh, the in-charge of the project, said.

JAIPUR: The Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) is waiting for another incident to happen as the proposed work to improve the six junctions on major roads in the city is pending.

After witnessing fatal accidents on JDA Circle a year ago, the civic body proposed to improve traffic on seven junctions, including OTS Circle, Jawahar Circle, Rambagh Junction, Mansarovar Metro Junction, B2 Bypass, Collectorate Circle and JDA Circle. However, redesigning work of only JDA Circle has been completed.

A JDA official said, “Due to Covid, the work could not be taken up. At present, the work on OTS Circle is under progress, which is almost completed. The redesigning work for all the circles will be finished by October 2020.” Based on the suggestions received from the steering committee, the JDA had initiated work at major intersections and junctions of the city for swift traffic flow and make them accident-free.

An official said, “The design of island, median, zebra crossing and poles at the circle intersection will be rectified to prevent accidents. After a survey, the committee constituted to improve traffic conditions suggested to alter the designs.”

The official added that to provide clear visibility from Ambedkar Circle and Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) office, the civic body at Rambagh had earlier reduced the size of the railing and chopped the plants and trees. “It was also suggested to reduce the width of the slip lane to 5-7 metres connecting Ambedkar Circle Road and JMC office road,” said a JDA engineer.

Sources said the committee had recommended constructing flyovers at Rambagh. “A proposal to construct a flyover at Rambagh is long pending. However, it was shelved due to lack of funds,” sources said.

The move is seen as the government’s bid to fast-track surveillance and ascertain the spread of pandemic, which has gripped more than 63,000 people and claimed 1,400 lives.In a communique to municipal commissioners and heads of nagar palika parishads and nagar panchayats on July 24, special secretary, urban development, Sanjay Singh, said, procurement of equipment should be done quickly to equip teams constituted by the state government to carry out door-to-door surveillance. Singh said, the survey teams will zero in on districts with high Covid count to fast-track testing. On July 20, the local bodies’ directorate pressed for utilizing funds of urban local bodies’ or state finance commission to purchase two Corona detection equipment.Officials said, these will be provided to teams after sanitization. The UP government’s bid to step up surveillance comes close on heels of chief minister Yogi Adityanath ’s directive to ramp up testing to 1 lakh per day.

KOTA: The detection of 24 fresh corona positive cases in mahila jail of Kota Central Jail on Sunday morning has sent the jail staff as well as the local administration into a tizzy taking the total number of Covid-19 infected inmates to 41.

As many as 260 male inmates have been lodged in the mahila jail. Now, containing the spread in the main jail accommodating 1,100 inmates poses a challenge to the authorities. Female inmates had been shifted to other jails, deputy superintendent of jail Shravan Lal Jat said. The main jail where 1,100 inmates are lodged is currently protected from the infection, but keeping all the inmates safe is a challenge. The jail is congested and overcrowded and it is hardly possible to protect the inmates from infection, he said. The first inmate, who was lodged in jail under judicial custody on July 14 from Vigyan Nagar police station, tested positive on July 18, he further said, adding 50% of the inmates in Kota Central Jail carry symptoms pertaining to Covid-19 and the samples of such inmates are being collected. Besides, freshly arriving inmates are being shifted to jail in Sangod town of the district.

Meanwhile, in Kota and Bundi districts reported 123 and 34 cases, respectively, on Saturday taking the total to 1,305 in Kota and 83 in Bundi. Of the 34 cases in Bundi, 17 were from Bundi district transport office which was shut on Saturday following the detection of an infected employee.

238,['27/07/2020'],‘Suspend patents on Covid-19 drugs in India to ensure accessibility &amp; affordability’,"Mumbai: India should consider temporarily restricting and suspending intellectual property, including patents and designs, on all Covid-19 medical products like diagnostics, medicines and vaccines, according to public health experts. This, they say, could be one of the ways to ensure accessibility and affordability of key life-saving drugs for Covid-19 to not only patients in India but to millions across the world.Patent and public health experts told TOI that India is a special case because of its huge population and it’s responsibility as the ‘pharmacy of the developing world’. It is important that it be able to meet the needs of its own population to access safe and effective Covid-19 medicines and vaccines. But it also needs legal freedom to produce massive surpluses that can be exported to other countries, especially lower and middle-income countries at risk of being left behind because of the surge of ‘vaccine and therapeutic nationalism’ in US and Europe, they added.This could well be one of the ways of ensuring accessibility and affordability of drugs/vaccines, and to prevent instances of shortages of potential medicines going forward. A case in point is the shortage and consequent price gouging being witnessed across cities in the case of Gilead’s Remdesivir and Roche’s Tocilizumab, putting many patients through hardship.Similar measures are also being taken up by countries in the European Union, South America and South Africa.Leena Menghaney from Medecins Sans Frontieres said: “To address intellectual property (IP) barriers, Indian government should consider restricting and automatically licensing all IP including patents and designs on all Covid-19 medical tools including diagnostics, devices, medicines and vaccine as the pandemic is a public health emergency and time cannot be wasted on lengthy negotiations and legal challenges. Chile has already introduced legislation, and Germany introduced the Epidemic Protection Act, which provides for measures to restrict German patents covering pharmaceuticals or medical devices. This would immediately allow open competition and increase access to medical tools needed to detect, treat and prevent the dreaded disease”India’s patent and drug regulatory laws have helped protect and market price-lowering generic competition, so much so that it’s called the “pharmacy of the developing world”. It supplies over one-third of life-saving drugs globally. A majority of medicines for dreaded diseases like tuberculosis , HIV and malaria are affordable generics made here.“The most pragmatic solution for India would be to adopt emergency rules and streamlined procedures to allow automatic, mandatory, or presumptive compulsory licenses that could override granted and pending patents on any and all Covid-19 related medical products. At the same time governments could allow for exceptions to data protection and trade secret rights where they present barriers to generic and biosimilar companies being able to make therapeutic equivalent products. Countries like India with robust manufacturing capacity should also grant automatic licenses allowing for export of unlimited quantities of medical products to countries that lack meaningful domestic capacity. To do so, they should rely on TRIPS Article 30. Even if countries do adopt such powerful compulsory licensing regimes, they have to overcome their own self-imposed reluctance — or informal moratoriums as in India — to issue compulsory licenses”, Professor Brook K Baker of Northeastern U School of Law and senior policy analyst, Health GAP (Global Access Project), said.Agreeing with the move to side-step patents, Prathibha Sivasubramanian, legal researcher Third World Network said “For repurposed drugs (like remdesivir), price control should be brought in and generic production allowed”.Earlier, civil society and NGOs have also highlighted how high prices and monopolies of patented medicines have undermined access to treatment of HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis C in the developing world.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77197895,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-50166,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/suspend-patents-on-covid-19-drugs-in-india-to-ensure-accessibility-affordability/articleshow/77188105.cms

The state Directorate of Vocational Education and Training (DVET) has issued a notification that all admissions to ITIs will take place this year through the app called ‘MahaITI’.

A panel was set up under the chairmanship of joint director of DVET, Anil Jadhav, to relook at admissions considering the Covid-19 situation. Jadhav recommended that four admission rounds for 2020-21 be conducted based on a merit list at the state and district-level.

Jadhav said, “The students will be given admissions based on marks, group and preference list. A district level committee will be constituted to monitor the admissions. After the four merit lists are announced, a counselling round will also be held.”

The private ITI institutes will have to announce the admissions conducted under the management and minority quota on their website. These seats will also be filled online, Jadhav said. The state admissions committee will monitor the process in the entire Maharashtra.

The students will have to download the application on their phones. The forms will be available on the app. Students will have to fill up their seat number and all the details will automatically load on the app. Preference of colleges and branches will have to be selected by the students.

240,['27/07/2020'],Rajasthan: Absence of Congress MLAs taking toll on Jan Sunwais,"A deserted view of the MLA quarters in Jaipur on Sunday

JAIPUR: The absence of Congress ministers and MLAs of both camps — CM Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot — from their offices and field for the past 13 days has left residents in the lurch. Every day, people heading to their residences with various kinds of pleas are being received by either their family members or office bearers.

The most visited residences are of education, health, agriculture and PWD ministers. On any given day, these ministers attract 200-500 people from across the state. Jan Sunwais have taken a backseat after the political crisis started.

“I visited the residence of education minister Govind Singhji to highlight the condition of at least 10 senior secondary schools in Nagaur which can collapse in the rainy season but learnt that he is operating from a hotel and nobody has the access. Left with no choice, I left the application at his residence on July 21 hoping that he will issue some directions,” said Subhash Yadav, a social activist based in Nagaur.

Since July 13, 101 MLAs including two BTP legislators are holed up in a five-star hotel in Jaipur while 19 Congress MLAs along with three independents belonging to the Sachin Pilot camp are at Manesar in Haryana . They are facing critism since they are not available in the field leaving people in distress.

The role of MLAs has become very important in the pandemic when almost all departments are working at a slow pace. Almost every day residents flock to their residences with problems related to patwaris, tehsildars and police to name a few. The absence is only adding to their anger.

Salama Begum (66) of Ramganj , who is suffering from cancer and is desperately looking for financial assistance under the chief minister relief fund (medical), is running from the pillar to the post to get a letter signed by her MLA Rafiq Khan. “The surgery of my mother is pending for the last six months due to the pandemic. But now when the doctor said they are ready for the operation, I am not getting Khan’s signature,” said Begum.

First-time MLA Mukesh Bhakar from Ladnun in Nagaur, who had assured of responding to his voters 24/7 in election rallies, hardly responds to anyone. He is in the Pilot group and has been missing from office for the past 18 days. “Locusts have been repeatedly attacking out area giving us sleepless nights. The agriculture department is yet to do an assessment of the damage caused by the pests in the area. We (farmers) have been calling him but no response,” said Ram Singh, a farmer based in Ladnun.

Political analyst Avadesh Akodia said an MLA acts as a link between the government and the public. “The presence of MLAs is very vital for the smooth functioning of the local administration. He/she (MLA) can provide an instant solution to most of the genuine problems people are facing,” said Akodia.

JAIPUR: Intense containment measures will be implemented in Alwar , which is one of the worst-hit districts in terms of spiralling Covid cases. Out of the total cases, 60% are active, which is a cause of concern for health authorities. In all, 1,724 persons are yet to be cured of the virus. The health department is facing a challenge where to keep the asymptomatic patients. Now, it has been decided to keep them in multi-storey buildings where flats are lying vacant.

Alwar’s industrial town Bhiwadi , which is quite close to Delhi, is witnessing a spike in cases. Majority of the affected population are labourers, who are living in slums. A health department official said that since slum areas are congested and possibility of the spread of the virus is quite high there, they have decided to shift Covid patients to vacant flats in multistorey buildings where positive cases will get isolated.

With sudden spike in cases, health department officials have allowed majority of asymptomatic patients for home isolation as they do not require much treatment but only observation and monitoring. Alwar is one of the three districts with the highest number of active cases. As many as 463 people have been found infected with the virus in the past 36 hours (till Sunday morning). The health authorities are conducting intense contact tracing to break the chain of infection.

“The taluka has five market centres that send fruits, vegetables to cities line Mumbai. There is huge supply of agriculture produce from here owing to which the farmers and traders are bound to travel.

244,['27/07/2020'],Second notices sent to suspended MLAs,"Jaipur:The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has issued second notices to suspended MLAs Bhanwarlal Sharma and Vishvendra Singh after they failed to respond to the previous ones. The notices were sent to the duo to record their statements in connection with the audio clips in which they were allegedly heard talking about attempts to topple the government.

“The MLAs who were sent notices earlier last week are yet to respond. We have again sent the notices via email and they have been asked to respond within a week,” said a senior official of ACB.

ACB had sent notices to Sharma and Singh following the FIR lodged by Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi claiming that the accused were in cahoots with others to topple the state government. Joshi had provided two audio recordings to the agency in which the politicians were apparently heard talking about horse-trading of MLAs.

Previously the notices given to the MLAs asked them to respond in three days time, the deadline for which expired on Thursday.

In the complaint filed on July 11, Joshi had mentioned the names of three individuals who were heard in the audio clips — MLA Bhanwarlal Sharma, Sanjay Jain and Gajendra Singh —, though it does not specify if it was the voice of the Union minister. Out of the two clips, no names were taken in one of them though sources claimed that the conversation was between the former tourism minister and Gajendra Singh. On Saturday, the ACB registered an FIR under the Prevention of Corruption Act.

On June 10, the ACB had also received a complaint from Joshi in connection with perceived horse-trading of MLAs following which they started a confidential investigation into the matter. The Special Operations Group (SOG) is also conducting a separate investigation in the same matter under IPC sections for sedition and criminal conspiracy.

249,['27/07/2020'],Heavy metal contamination found in Gulf of Kutch,"Ahmedabad: Environmental scientists have warned of heavy metal contamination in the Gulf of Kutch, after they found accumulation of toxic metals like chromium, copper, nickel, lead and traces of mercury, in a first comprehensive geochemical study of the Gulf’s sediments to assess the heavy metal concentrations .

The scientists were worried of copper contamination, sediment quality and their ecological risk in the coastal sediments. Samples were taken from 10 stations spread across a 150km stretch.

According to a study published in the journal of Environmental Earth Sciences in April this year, metal presence in the sediments was measured in micrograms per gram. Copper ranged between 17.83 micrograms to 61.41 micrograms, nickel ranged from 11.31 micrograms to 37.43 micrograms, chromium ranged from 32.26 to 67.44 micrograms, cadmium ranged between 0.01 and 0.3 micrograms while lead was found to be between 8 and 16.4 micrograms at these 10 sampling stations.

The locations considered for the study were Okha, Gopi, Pindara, Dhani, Salaya, two places in Narara, Sikka, Rozi, and Jodiya. The study observed that the presence of heavy metals in tissues of aquatic organisms like fish, planktons, molluscs and algae inhabiting coastal areas has also been reported. Bio-accumulation of heavy metals in marine organisms contributes to genetic damage by inducing double-strand breaks in DNA and inhibits critical proteins in DNA repair pathways

The study involved department of life sciences, Maharaja Krishnakumarsinhji Bhavnagar University, Bhavnagar, department of biosciences, school of sciences, Indrashil University, Rajpur and Gujarat Ecology Society, Vadodara.

The study found maximum concentration of heavy metals at Pindara, followed by Jodiya and Rozi. Least concentration was detected at Sikka.

The researchers Haresh Panseriya, Haren B Gosai, Amita Sankhwal, Bhumi Sachaniya and Deepa Gavali pointed out that the origin of these heavy metal contaminants were from the central part of gulf which includes about 37 large — and medium scale industries having plants such as cement, fertilizers, woollen cloth, petrochemicals, oil refineries, solvents, bauxite, soda-ash and caustic soda.

A similar scenario was also observed at Okha in the western part of the gulf where metallurgical, agro-based industries, mineral-based and chemical industries were located. “Land mining activities near Pindara are a major influencing factor for sediment contamination,” the study claimed.

JAIPUR: State BJP has blamed the rising Covid-19 cases to the ruling government’s ‘sponsored’ political crisis in the state.

Speaking to the reporters on Sunday, state BJP president Satish Poonia has called CM Ashok Gehlot insensitive for ignoring the plight of its citizens while enjoying the hospitality with his contingent of MLAs at a five-star hotel. “The Covid-19 cases have crossed 35,000-mark and the death toll has crossed 600 in the state, but the government is busy in its drama over leadership crisis. The people of the state will never forgive them seeing their public representatives busy in fun and frolic activities like playing football, carrom, watching movies and antakshri while they were left to suffer,” said Poonia. He asked Gehlot for how many more days the government will be held hostage at a hotel?

He asked the government to show what work they have done for the people since Lockdown 1.0. “Neither do they have any control over Covid-19 cases, nor on the rising cases of crimes. The government is a complete failure,” Poonia added.

Meanwhile, BJP MLA Madan Dilawar has accused the speaker’s office of acting on his plea challenging the merger of six BSP MLAs with the Congress party without taking him into the loop on Sunday.

Dilawar had petitioned before speaker C P Joshi on the merger of BSP calling it unlawful and unconstitutional under the anti-defection law. The merger was notified by the speaker on September 18, 2019. “I challenged the merger in March 2020, but no action was taken by the speaker till I moved a petition for the same on July 14. I am aghast to learn from the news reports that my petition has been rejected by the speaker. This move is against the natural principle of justice in which both the parties are heard by the arbitrator,” Dilawar said.

Dhami, who is 90 % disabled — he was stuck with paralysis when he was 3 years old — has won numerous awards for his performance on the cricketing field. He also has a MA in History as well as a B Ed degree. But despite his qualifications as well as performance as a sportsperson who has represented the country and continues to represent the state, he was left without a source of income during the Covid-19-induced lockdown.

“Before the lockdown, I was giving coaching to wheelchair-bound children interested in playing cricket in Rudrapur. But because of the lockdown, this came to a halt and as a result, I came to my village Raikot in Pithoragarh, where my parents live,” Dhami told TOI. He added that a few months into the lockdown, it became very difficult to make ends meet. “My parents are old. I have a sister and younger brother as well. My brother used to work at a hotel in Gujarat but he, too, lost his job during the lockdown. Therefore, I decided to take up work in my village under the MGNREGA scheme,” said the cricketer who has toured several countries like Malaysia, Bangladesh and Nepal while leading the Uttarakhand wheelchair cricket team.

On being queried whether he approached anybody for help, Dhami, who has led the Indian side in the India-Nepal-Bangladesh triangular wheelchair cricket series in 2017, said, “ Some people have come forward to help like actor Sonu Sood who sent me Rs 11,000. There are people in Rudrapur and Pithoragarh also who have helped me financially.” He added that “there is no problem in doing any kind of job to earn a living.” “I took up the MGNREGA job because it enables me to work near my home. These are difficult times but I know I will be able to overcome them,” he said with a cheerful smile.

Senior officials of the Nashik civil hospital said approximately 300 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) tests can be conducted every day at the laboratory.

Currently, the throat swabs are sent for testing to MVP Medical College in the city, Dhule government medical college and Pune’s Armed Force Medical College.

Nikhil Saindane, the additional civil surgeon of Nashik Civil Hospital, said the work to construct the lab is underway. We had identified a hall at the hospital for the Covid lab.”

“The work of training the lab technicians is also underway and all the necessary machineries for testing have arrived. The lab would be operational in a week’s time,” added Saindane.

Meanwhile, across the district testes are being conducted on Covid suspects with the help of rapid antigen test kits.

Officials said the antigen tests are proving extremely handy to get quick results but they have 50% sensitivity, which means tests of Covid patients can also show negative results. So, for complete diagnosis of the infection, RTPCR tests is the only option.

The district has been witnessing an increase in the number of cases following the process of unlocking and people venturing out of their houses.

The need of sending throat swab samples to MVP College and to Pune will reduce considerably, once the RTPCR testing lab is operational.

255,['27/07/2020'],"Instead of fighting Covid and China, Centre conspiring to topple Congress governments: Ajay Maken","Ajay Maken

JAIPUR: The Congress on Sunday said that the BJP conspiracy to topple Rajasthan ’s elected government has made it clear that the disruptive forces want to make democracy a “Dilli durbar ki daasi” (maid of the Centre/Delhi Durbar) and a puppet of its hand. The party accused the BJP-led Centre government of conspiring to topple Congress governments in various states, instead of fighting the financial crisis, Covid-19 and China.

Former union minister and Congress leader Ajay Maken said the country was witnessing unprecedented attacks on its constitutional bodies, as hurdles were being created in the functioning of Rajasthan's speaker while the state’s elected government was being denied the constitutional right to call an assembly session.

The party’s ‘SpeakUpForDemocracy’ digital campaign launched on Saturday posed five questions to people on whether BJP’s attack on democracy and constitution was acceptable to them. The Congress asked if the judiciary could unconstitutionally interfere in the functioning of the legislature and would it not lead to a conflict between the two.

“People should voice their concerns through our campaign #SpeakUpForDemocracy. This would be a true patriotic step,” Maken said, addressing a press conference.

The Congress reiterated it would protest outside the Raj Bhavans in all states, except Rajasthan, on Monday to demand that democratically elected governments be allowed to function. On Monday, the Supreme Court was also scheduled to continue hearing on speaker CP Joshi ’s special leave petition (SLP) challenging the Rajasthan high court’s interference in his functioning at the stage of issuing show-cause notices to legislators. Sources said the speaker might withdraw the SLP.

“Our hopes of getting justice from the judiciary have dashed. People occupying constitutional posts like governor seem helpless in protecting the constitution. BJP is trying to crush the mandate of 8-crore people of Rajasthan, so we will be taking the issue straight to the people,” Maken said. He added, “The Congress workers and countrymen will stage Gandhian dharna in support of Rajasthan’s majority government and the state’s Congress MLAs who have been fighting to protect the constitution and democracy.”

For the first time, the applications from candidates unsatisfied with their marks were invited online. The class X and XII UP Board results were declared on June 27.

Though UPSEB did not share the data, sources said the number of application forms received for scrutiny is almost 1 lakh every year.

This year, 32,084 applications have asked for re-checking of copies. While 24,291 are from class XII examinees, 7,813 are from class X candidates.

Reasons for the drop include the increase in scrutiny fee by five times and making the application process online. The Covid-induced lockdown, said officials, also prevented candidates from visiting cyber cafes to fill in the form. Till last year, examinees seeking scrutiny had to apply offline.

UPSEB allows scrutiny where the answer copies are re-checked to ensure that the candidate has been awarded marks for all attempted questions. Re-totalling is done to verify the grand total awarded to the candidate.

Candidates have to pay Rs 500 per subject for scrutiny. Till 2018, the scrutiny fee was Rs 100 per subject. There is no process for revaluation of the answer copy. This year, Prayagraj region received the highest scrutiny applications (10,231) followed by Varanasi region with 7,624 applications. While Meerut region received 6,752 applications, Gorakhpur and Bareilly regions got 4,318 and 3,159 applications respectively.

NSUI state president Abhishek Choudhary is approaching the families of rebel MLAs with flowers to convey a message of respecting people’s mandate by saving the democratically elected government.

“All these 19 MLAs are our senior party leaders who won on the Congress ticket in December 2018. Neither they have quit Congress nor joined the BJP. It clearly means that they are part of the family and have some differences which can be sorted out with a dialogue,” said Choudhary, who has covered the residence of nine rebel MLAs by 4pm. His team started the day by approaching the family of Ved Prakash at his residence at Mansarovar in Jaipur.

“Here we took the blessings of his mother and urged the family to convey our message to respected Prakasji to return to the party. She told me that Prakashji’s father is unwell. I took the doctor to her residence,” said Choudhary.

The next in line was the residence of Tonk MLA Sachin Pilot. Here the NSUI team met Nathu Lal one of the staff members at his residence. They, however, returned leaving red roses at his residence. The team met the brother of MLA Dausa Murari Lal Meena and conveyed him the message that how he had contested the polls against the divisive politics of BJP.

“His brother has told him to have genuine concerns which the party had ignored. I assured him the entire NSUI team is with him once he returns and bats for his genuine demands,” said Choudhary.

LUCKNOW: “I am ready to go to jail, not once but hundreds of times for the Ram temple. I own up the responsibility for whatever had happened....” With these words, the then UP chief minister Kalyan Singh said he as the CM was responsible for Babri Masjid demolition on December 6, 1992, in Ayodhya. His admission earned him the Supreme Court's admonition and he had to spend a day in Tihar jail. However, his step saved the careers of seven senior officers .

“Had Kalyan Singh not owned up the responsibility of whatever happened on that fateful day, we would have been languishing behind the bars,” remarks an IAS officer who had held a key position in the office of then CM, now leading a peaceful retired life. Kalyan was jailed for a day for contempt as he had given an affidavit in the Supreme Court before kar seva that no damage would be done to the mosque. However, a similar punishment would have ended the career of these IAS, IPS and PCS officers at that time.

After the demolition, the apex court served contempt notice on Kalyan Singh and key officers like Prabhat Kumar, then principal secretary , home; Alok Sinha, secretary, tourism; Shankar Agarwal, special secretary, home; Jivesh Nandan, joint secretary, home; RN Srivastava, district magistrate, Faizabad; DB Rai, SSP, Faizabad and Umesh Tewari, ADM, Faizabad. While six of them have now retired, Nandan is serving as additional secretary, home, at the Centre.

""As the kar sevaks started gathering in Ayodhya before December 6, 1992, the Central government was sensing a threat to the Babri Masjid. The VHP, however, had promised only a symbolic 'kar seva' around the Ram Janmabhoomi site,"" recalls an old-timers.

While senior saffron leaders, too, reached Ayodhya a day before, the then CM of undivided UP, Kalyan Singh, had to submit an affidavit before the Supreme Court for maintaining the status quo at the disputed site and ensuring that no untoward incident happened there. On behalf of the government, the then principal secretary, home, Prabhat Kumar and other offices had also submitted the affidavit before the Supreme Court. However, when the Babri Masjid was demolished on December 6, 1992, the Supreme Court, taking note of the oath and affidavit by the Kalyan Singh government, issued notices of contempt of court to the then CM as well as to the officers.

The contempt notice rattled these officers and they feared that their career might come to an abrupt end if the court pronounced any punishment. However, Kalyan Singh owned up the responsibility and the Supreme Court sent him to jail in October 1994 symbolically for one day, saving the career of seven officers.

Later, Prabhat Kumar rose to the post of cabinet secretary and then became the governor of Bihar. Alok Sinha retired as FCI chairman and Shekhar Agarwal retired as secretary, government of India. RN Srivastav, the then DM, Faizabad, has passed away while; DB Rai, the then SSP, Faizabad, went on to become a BJP MP and Umesh Tewari retired as DM, Maharajganj.

259,['27/07/2020'],Local transmission on as Trichy sees 670 fresh cases in 5 days,"Trichy: Trichy city has reported 670 fresh Covid-19 positive cases in just five days from July 21 and 25, outnumbering the total cases reported between March and June. Unlike the previous months when cases were reported in hotspots, the infection is now widespread, not leaving any of the civic body wards. With district borders closed, the local transmission within the 65 wards and suburbs has led to the city recording an average 130 positive cases a day in the last few days.

On July 24 alone, the city recorded a maximum of 177 cases. Accounting for 70% of fresh cases in the district, the surge was attributed to enhanced fever surveillance and testing through fever camps. Trichy corporation has acknowledged that the fresh infections were due to local transmission. Even people who were indoors most of the time but who ventured out to shops have been testing positive. Local transmission is happening in commercial streets and workplaces and the infection is passed on to families and even neighbours. Frontline professionals including doctors, paramedical staff and ambulance drivers had tested positive in recent days.

“Roadside eateries and tea stalls still gather crowds. It appears that the authorities are tired and clueless in controlling the spread,” K P Rangaprasad, joint secretary, Satta Panchayat Iyakkam said. The isolation facility established at Yatri Nivas to quarantine primary contacts of positive cases is almost full that the civic body insists primary contacts be on home quarantine if possible. Apart from increased testing from 300 a day to around 600, family members of primary positive cases contracting the infection was another reason for the surge, officials added. “People should avoid crowded spots, wear face masks and frequently wash hands to help us bring down the infections. Public cooperation is vital,” corporation commissioner S Sivasubramanian said.

260,['27/07/2020'],Residents block society’s gates over ambulance entry,"Sangita Apartments earlier asked the clinic not to allow Covid patients

Vadodara: Residents of a society on RC Dutt Road created ruckus on Saturday night to stop an ambulance from entering their complex which also houses a medical imaging centre besides five residential buildings.

On Sunday, 21 residents including eight women were detained for unlawful assembly, endangering life, wrongful restraint and under Disaster Management Act.

The issue cropped up as residents of Sangita Apartments had closed their complex’s gate after informing Dr Viren Shah, who runs the imaging centre on the ground floor, about it. According to Shah, some residents had informed him through WhatsApp on Saturday evening that as Covid-19 patients visit his centre, they are closing the gates for all.

“I told them that the government has allowed imaging centres to remain open as it comes under medical services and I cannot close it. I also informed civic body’s health officer Dr Devesh Patel about it and he, too, asked me to keep the centre open,” Shah told TOI.

He added that the complex has just one gate but has an approach which passes through a private property. “The other approach entrance too had been closed and the residents closed the gate of the complex illegally,” Shah said.

On Saturday night, when an ambulance from a cardiology hospital reached the imaging centre’s gate, dozens of residents stopped the vehicle from entering. Even as police intervened, residents got into arguments with them and the ambulance carrying an elderly woman left.

Eventually as cops detained some of the residents, the ambulance arrived again and it was allowed to enter.

The residents said that they don’t have any issue towards the imaging centre but the ambulance or other medical staff that arrives with patients throw their masks and gloves in the complex premises. They also claimed that representations were made to civic body and police about it, but nobody acted.

“The patients who come, roam around in the society and they do not practice any hygiene,” said a resident.

“We have been telling the doctor repeatedly. Suspected Covid-19 patients and other patients come here for CT Scan and until the patient’s turn comes for the test, they are out in the society and the medical waste is thrown openly,” said Ketan Shah, president, society association’s president. He added that the residents held a meeting on Saturday and served notice to the imaging centre before closing the gate.

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited ( MSEDCL ) has claimed that the road digging work undertaken by the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) is causing damage to its underground power cables , resulting in the frequent power failure in certain parts of the city.

In a press statement, the MSEDCL stated that frequent digging for the Smart City project, drainage, and water supply works has resulted in damages to its cables in as many as 131 different places in the twin cities.

The statement by the electricity distribution company further added, “Power supply to thousands of consumers in Pimpri Chinchwad corporation limits was disrupted in the last few months because underground cables of the MSEDCL were damaged during road digging. The cables from Pimple Gurav, Nigadi and Thergaon areas, were particularly damaged.”

The statement also mentioned that the department and the contractor involved in the digging work should ideally notify the MSEDCL before digging so that it can provide information about underground cables. However, since the procedure was not followed, consumers had to suffer during the unwarranted power failure. The MSEDCL in turn had to suffer financial losses due to the damaged cables, the press release said.

The MSEDCL has to provide alternate power supply in case of damage to cables and therefore notifying the company becomes absolutely necessary, it added.

“The areas such as Sudarshan Chowk, Ramkrishna Mangal Karyalaya, Laxmi nagar, Gulmohar colony in Pimple Gurav have seen damage to the power cables in as many as 53 different incidents in the past five months, while Wakad area too has seen such incidents at least 17 times,” the statement issued by the distribution company said.

In Bhosari area incidents of damage have been recorded at least 19 times, the statement mentioned.

Even with his modest income, he does not forget to feed the homeless as he himself was a beggar till only a few months ago and relied on others for food.

Whenever he comes across people on the roadside, it reminds him of the days when he was begging around in tattered clothes. “I prepare extra food when I prepare for myself. I carry 10 packets of food along with me during each meal time and hand it over to the needy with a water bottle,” he said.

Tamilarasan lost his parents when he was just one-and-half-years-old and was raised at a home in Aruppukkottai. He passed out with a bachelor’s degree in computer science from a college in Dindigul district and went to Chennai in 2017 with dream of landing a job. He tried getting a job installing CCTV as he was good at it, even tried in malls, textile showrooms and hotels, but learnt it the hard way that connections are required to land a job.

One night, towards the end of 2017, his bag containing his certificates, a pair of dress and Rs 2,000 cash was stolen. Faced with starvation, he started looking for food in garbage bins and eventually begged for money. After spending three years in Chennai, he came to Madurai to try his luck.

He made Madurai railway junction his home but was chased away when the Covid-19 lockdown came into force. He moved to Alanganallur with Rs 7,300 in his hand. He wanted to get a shelter first, but people were not ready to rent out a portion for a stranger.

“A local youth helped me by speaking to a house owner to get a room at Rs 1,300 on monthly rent. I did not meet him before or after that. I was thinking for a whole week what to do in life next before taking a decision to sell tea. There are many tea shops in the area but all of them were closed due to the lockdown and I saw it as an opportunity,” he said.

Although he made Rs 2,000 daily during the lockdown, his earnings came down to Rs 600 as tea shops are now open. He tried to get Rs 1.5 lakh loan through Prime Minister Employment Generation Program to start a computer centre to pay bills and access government services for people. Although it was approved by the district industries centres, the loan was rejected by Canara Bank for lack of documents.

271,['27/07/2020'],Gujarat: Hardik Patel’s elevation sparks leadership struggle,"GANDHINAGAR: The elevation of former Patidar reservation agitation leader Hardik Patel to working president has caused upheaval in the Gujarat Congress. While a small but enthusiastic section of young workers are upbeat about the development, the old brass is upset and believes he will cause more damage than gain to the party.

The 27-year-old Hardik has emerged as a challenger to leader of opposition Paresh Dhanani, who is also the face of the Patidar community in the party. Party insiders say Hardik Patel’s appointment will create a struggle for leadership of the Patidar community.

A veteran Congress leader who has been with the party for over three decades said, “Many of our age group are not keen on working under Hardik Patel. Getting media attention for the wrong reasons is one thing, and getting votes for the party is an altogether different thing. The Congress did benefit from the Patidar agitation, but is it now a thing of the past. Wooing voters on caste and community lines is difficult.”

On the power struggle within the party, sources in the Congress said, “Hardik has emerged as a challenger to leader of opposition Paresh Dhanani, who is seen as the strongest Patidar leader in the party. Hardik is certainly capable of attracting the masses. About half a dozen MLAs are with Hardik and Dhanani will struggle to maintain his leadership of the community in the coming days.”Another senior Congress leader said, “Hardik Patel’s hardliner image in favour of the Patidar community is certainly a big problem for us. The SC, ST and OBC communities are traditional Congress vote banks. Non-Patidar communities and leaders are likely to be displeased with his elevation as working president. It remains to be seen whether he turns out to be an asset or liability for the Congress in 2022.”

A group of doctors across several specialisations in the city are now part of the collective named Majha Doctor, Majhya Ghari (My doctor At My Home).

They aim to reach out to citizens hesitant to visit hospitals’ out- patient departments or clinics for consultation, due to fear of contracting the coronavirus.

That collective started in June has completed nearly 60 housecalls in about a month, the majority of the patients being senior citizens.

“Families used to have their doctors, who would know and trust each other, and they could share their medical issues and expect them to be solved. With the advent of specialist physicians, the concept of the family doctor was largely gone and there’s a gap between the patient and the doctor. With this venture, where people can schedule specialist appointments at their homes, we are somewhat trying to bring the family doctor concept back, especially with the pandemic, as many are afraid to visit hospitals or clinics for consultation,” Rituparna Shinde, a cardiologist, and founder of the venture, said.

“In a few cases, we found that the patients were experiencing a stroke. In other cases, we found cases of appendicitis and urinary tract infection. Since some were not our patients originally, we set up a video link with their doctors, so that we could prescribe the appropriate medicine according to the patient’s medical history,” diabetologist Ashwini Joshi,said. included

MADURAI: Madras high court has confirmed a single judge’s order upholding the removal from service of a police constable who attempted suicide using his service rifle during duty at the residential quarters on the high court Madurai bench campus in 2016.

S Kameswaran, who was appointed as police constable in 2011, was posed for duty as security guard at the residential quarters of one of the judges of the high court. He attempted suicide due to mental stress using his service rifle on June 9, 2016. Following the incident, a criminal case was registered and, after inquiry, the disciplinary authority awarded punishment of removal of service. When the appellant preferred an appeal, the appellate authority confirmed the punishment on the ground that he had attempted suicide twice earlier.

The judges said that the appellant had admitted his delinquency but pleaded for leniency and mercy. The judges said the disciplinary authority had exhibited some leniency by passing the order of removal from service instead of dismissal so that it does not operate as stigma with respect to his future career. Observing that there was no infirmity in the order of the authorities, the judges confirmed the single judge’s order and dismissed the appeal.

280,['27/07/2020'],BJP using govt machinery to come to power: Cong,"Panaji: Congress on Sunday condemned BJP for using government machinery to destabilise and topple state governments around the country. Party leaders said that BJP has undermined every law and institution in the past six years and “legalised horse trading” to come to power .

“Rajasthan is the latest example of how BJP under Prime Minister Narendra Modi misuses institutions and taxpayer money to destabilise and topple democratically-elected governments,” state Congress president Girish Chodankar said.

In an online campaign, Congress called on the people to condemn BJP for thwarting their mandate. “The people’s mandate is very important, and people’s will will always have priority,” leader of opposition Digambar Kamat said.

“Right from 2017, we saw how the rights of elected representatives were trampled, like in Manipur and Goa, (where) in spite of the mandate being given to Congress, they didn’t allow the party to form the government,” he further said.

After forming governments in Manipur and Goa, BJP also succeeded in toppling the Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh state governments.

In the case of Rajasthan , Goa desk in-charge and AICC secretary A Chellakumar directly blamed Modi for stalling the urgent assembly session called by Congress. “They are trying to get the speaker’sdecision overuled,” Chellakumar said, adding, “This shows that the Modi government is trying to interfere in the legal system of the country. If Modi has faith in democracy, call the assembly session.”

Kamat said that even as the Covid-19 pandemic peaks, BJP is using undemocratic means to bring down Congress-ruled state governments. “I think it is high time that the people of India come together to show the world that India is a democratic country and will always remain a democratic country,” said Kamat.

The deceased Sureshkannan is the son of the appellant Sakthivel. On March 29, 2014, Sakthivel stabbed his son to death using a knife and also injured his 7-year-old daughter Sakthikala who tried to prevent the attack. When Sakthivel’s wife Rajakali and son Rajavel attempted to stop him, he caused injuries on himself using the knife.

A case was registered by the Kadayam police who arrested Sakthivel. The additional district and sessions court in Tirunelveli convicted and sentenced Sakthivel to undergo life imprisonment under IPC section 302 in 2018.

A division bench of Justice T Raja and Justice B Pugalendhi said that the defendant’s counsel relied on a medical certificate issued by a psychiatrist at the Tirunelveli medical college hospital in 2019, which stated he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and hence had committed the offence without his knowledge.

The judges said that the doctor who treated the appellant at the Tenkasi government hospital stated that he was conscious and answering questions. The judges said that Rajakali and her children who are witnesses in the case denied that the appellant was taking any treatment for mental illness.

The judges observed that as per IPC section 84, the act of a person of unsound mind is not an offence. Since no medical records were placed before this court stating that the appellant had taken treatment for any mental illness prior to the incident, the judges said the appellant is not eligible for exemption.

Hundreds of customers are suspected to have visited the campus when the employees, who had tested positive for Covid-10, were at work. But the authorities are yet to alert the customers to be under home quarantine.

SBI administrative office campus on McDonalds Road near Trichy railway junction accommodates several branches belonging to various banking verticals. Meanwhile, in a mass screening conducted on the campus by a recognised private lab on July 22, at least 30 banking and support staffs were tested positive for Covid-19. The results were intimated to the employees on July 23 and the bank was closed on July 24. However, on July 22 and July 23, at least hundreds of customers have visited the personal banking branch (PBB), home loan sales team (HLST) branch and small and medium enterprises (SME) branch functioning on the SBI administrative office campus. While fumigation was carried out to disinfect the campus, no efforts were made to trace the customers who visited the campus on July 22 and July 23. Two of the security guards were also tested positive.

Trichy Corporation acknowledged a communication gap between the civic body and SBI management. As a result, contact tracing and quarantining the customers are yet to begin, which is likely to pave the way for a new cluster in the city.

“Since the bank has reported a death, contact tracing is important. We will communicate with the lead bank to avail the details of the customers who had visited the bank,” Trichy Corporation commissioner S Sivasubramanian said. While efforts to contact the SBI Trichy’s management went in vain, lead bank Trichy said that the district administration will be intimated about the need for tracing the customers.

The first such centre could start functioning as soon as the health department gives its nod.Over the last two days, several housing societies held meetings with the New Town Forum & News (NTFN) — a New Town-based social welfare organisation that will provide support and guidance — on the need to set up such micro Covid care facilities at community halls or spaces inside complexes.The Greenwood Sonata Apartment Owners Association is the first to have planned and set up such a facility in collaboration with New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) and NTFN. They are waiting for the state health department’s approval to start off the facility.The housing society will launch the centre with two doctors – both residents of the complex. “We had a Covid patient in our complex who incidentally is a doctor by profession who has volunteered to join this initiative,” said Sudipta Mukherjee, president of Greenwood Sonata Apartment Owners Association.“We are ready and will start off the facility as soon as we get the approval. As of now, we will start with five beds and two doctors, while the nurses or caregivers will be outsourced,” Mukherjee said. The housing society has about 2,000 residents.NTFN chairman Samaresh Das said they have been planning Covid care units and are ready to assist housing complexes. “Many of the housing societies and blocks have expressed their willingness to set up such facilities within their complexes,” said Das.“It is a splendid initiative by the local welfare associations and NGOs and we, from NKDA, are supporting them on this initiative,” said NKDA chairman Debashis Sen.NKDA has set up a Covid war room where doctors and officials are monitoring the Covid situation in New Town and guiding the resident associations.Debanjan Kundu, one of the two doctors involved with the Greenwood Sonata initiative and was affected by Covid, said that the facility is being set up following the government’s micro Covid facility guidelines. “The hall has an attached bathroom and separate entry and exit gates. We have planned to turn this hall into a micro Covid facility for the benefit of the residents,” he said.Several housing societies have expressed their willingness to have such a facility in their complex and have set up teams to look into any emergency situation. “We are eager to have such a facility in our complex.

CHENNAI: While many Chennaiites welcomed the rain in June and July, for residents of Jamaliya Nagar Main Rroad and Krishnadass Road, it has become a nightmare — for whenever it rains, sewage starts bobbing out of the stormwater drain network.

Photos shared by residents show the road inundated in sewage. “This was after one full day of no rain,” said 67-year-old S Lokabiraman, a resident.

Residents say the problem has been recurring for six months now. However, officials from Greater Chennai Corporation and Metrowater have not fixed the leakage.

Lokabiraman, a local member of the citizen-led movement Exnora, said the drains are old and sewage lines have been diverted into the stormwater drain. “Some residents are releasing raw sewage into the drains which overflows during rain,” he said.

A senior corporation official said release of sewage was a problem across the city. “It chokes the drain network and impedes flow of rainwater through the drain,” the official said.

Residents said the drains are 20 years old and renovation work that began a few days ago ran into problems with the local police due to inadequate permissions.

A few days ago, a joint committee of local Metrowater and corporation officials surveyed the spot after complaints from residents.

Sources said that the head-load workers and vegetable traders who gave their swabs for the test were not following the home quarantine measures.

Trichy City Corporation conducted a mass screening on June 22, following pressure from various quarters for not screening people at the G Corner market where 10 vegetable vendors were suspected to have contracted Covid-19. But, the number of samples collected was restricted to 32, the lowest scale of mass screening ever conducted in the city since the outbreak. Though four days have passed since the samples were collected, Trichy Corporation has not disclosed the test results. However, the people who gave their samples are continuing with their routine life without waiting for the test results.

The delay in sharing the test results is happening for third time in the civic body. Previously, the authorities had delayed sharing the test results for mass screenings conducted at Gandhi market and Anna Nagar Uzhavar Sandhai market vendors. While none of the traders screened at Thevar Hall tested positive, seven in Uzhavar Sandhai were positive, and all of them were asymptomatic. The Uzhavar Sandhai test results were disclosed after five days.

Since the wholesale vegetable market at G Corner is visited by various grocery shops and retail vegetable traders for their purchase, local people have expressed their worry over a possible Covid-19 spread due to the delay in declaring the test results. “We are coordinating with MGMGH lab to get the test results. There seems to be a backlog of samples,” a corporation official said.

297,['27/07/2020'],West Bengal Lockdown News: Meeting today to decide new lockdown dates,"TimesView The first bi-weekly lockdowns would have given enforcing agencies a good idea of the areas of concern. Things must be improved here. But citizens too must behave responsibly on non-lockdown days. Irresponsible behaviour on five days of a week can undo all the good that two days of lockdown may do.

KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee is likely to hold a meeting with senior administrative officials, police and health experts on Monday to decide on the next set of lockdown dates . Senior state officials indicated the biweekly lockdown model has been “successful” and is likely to continue. The next announced lockdown date is July 29 (Wednesday).“The lockdown was successful and people, barring some, have willingly stayed indoors. This will help in our fight against the disease”, state director of health services, Ajay Chakraborty, said. Sukumar Mukherjee, who is part of the Bengal’s Covid advisory panel, said, “Intermittent lockdown is not a solution but it will help in flattening the curve. The lockdown has been successful. The state now needs to focus on how they will handle the crowd on non-lockdown days. People are pouring out once the markets are open and this will increase the risk further.”Sources indicated that the meeting on Monday is expected to decide the lockdown dates till August 15. But it is not clear on which day the state will declare the second lockdown this week due to religious festivities in the later part of the week. Thursday — July 30 — is Jhulan. Senior officers are also not keen on a back-to-back mid-week lockdown. The management of the Nakhoda mosque has formally announced that Eid Ul Azha will be celebrated on August 1, which is a Saturday. “The chief minister will preside over the meeting and take a final decision,” an officer said, even indicating that the meeting will consider whether to resume the biweekly lockdown from August first week.State home secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay had indicated that August lockdown dates would be decided on Monday and would depend on a “evolving dynamic feedback”. On July 20, a meeting chaired by the CM decided on the biweekly lockdown model, prompted by expert opinion that stressed the need to “break the chain of infection”. Experts had opined in the meeting that Bengal has experienced “some specific community transmissions” of the novel coronavirus . The last state-wide total lockdown day in Bengal was on May 31.Health experts also feel that the twice-a-week lockdown could reduce the disease burden, free up hospital beds and break the chain of transmission to a certain extent. But how much impact it could have on containing the spread of the infection will only be known on how successfully the complete lockdown is enforced and after a few weeks of such lockdown.The government, however, has given district magistrates the power to decide on the total lockdown dates. In many municipalities and district towns, a week-long lockdown is under way which will continue till next week.

Their anger was directed towards the senior staff who according to them withheld the ""Covid information"".

CMS Anita Dhasmana, however, said that it was a miscommunication and now the ward has been closed for sanitization. The ward was evacuated later on Sunday night and the patients were asked to make their own arrangements for treatment. Video clips of the incident are being shared on social media platforms.

A staff nurse, who doesn’t wish to be named, told TOI, “We are really worried as no one informed us that a Covid-19 positive woman was admitted here till evening and no sanitization was done after the woman was shifted to the Covid-19 ward. All the staff and the patients are now exposed to the deadly virus and immediate action should be taken in this case.”

In a video, a patient who was discharged was purportedly seen saying that she had no other option, but to shift to a private hospital. No alternative arrangements were made till the time of filing this report and several women were referred to community health centres for delivery.

Dr Dhasmana added, “We have sealed the delivery ward as of now and the staff nurses who came in contact with the woman have been quarantined and their samples would be sent for testing. The ward will start functioning soon.”

300,['27/07/2020'],Foxlights aiding fight against leopard attacks: Study,"Dehradun: Non-lethal visual deterrents like foxlights are likely to prove an effective solution to mitigate man-animal conflict and even prevent the degradation of numbers of carnivorous species, according to a study conducted by scientists from Wildlife Institute of India.

WII experts said that the year-long study was conducted under the National Mission on Himalayan Studies in the wake of the rising man-animal conflict due to leopards in Pauri district of Uttarakhand.

Depending on the size and spread of the village, foxlights were mounted at specific vantage points, at the periphery of a cluster of houses. The lights were solar-powered and flickered at random intervals during night. The computerised flash in three different colours were meant to ‘mimic movement or activity of local community members’ and could be seen over a kilometre. The study, conducted from April 2018 to April 2019, states that the killing of livestock in leopard attacks in Pauri’s 27 villages reduced to almost half (36) as compared to 69 in areas without foxlights.

It said, “A significant decline in livestock depredation by leopard in sites with predator deterrents support the hypothesis that foxlights reduced the number of livestock losses to nocturnal attacks within the villages in western Himalayas.”

WII senior scientist S Sathyakumar said, “This study is the first known experiment testing the effectiveness of non-lethal visual deterrents in reducing livestock losses to common leopards in south Asia. We suggest developing site-specific coexistence strategies and adopting non-lethal measures to safeguard carnivores, livestock and humans within shared landscapes. Fox light can give considerable success in improving human-predator relations and create pathways of coexistence within developing regions of the world.”

The study, published in PeerJ-the Journal of Life and Environmental Sciences recently, states that a staggering 125 leopards have been killed in Pauri alone between 1990 and 2005. In 2019, Uttarakhand lost 181 human lives to wildlife conflict and the topmost predator remained leopards which killed 61 people. This year too, at least 24 people have lost their lives to man-animal conflict, of which over 12 in leopard attacks alone.

“We have to use foxlights in combination with various other methods of human-wildlife conflict mitigation. A proper community support will help in getting optimum results,” added Sathyakumar.

301,['27/07/2020'],Families queue up after snag in Trichy crematorium,"Trichy: A snag that developed in Oyamari electric crematorium in Trichy made the waiting time longer for the families to cremate the Covid-19 casualties and people who died of other reasons. The crematorium has seen a surge in the arrival of bodies to the crematorium due to Covid-19. They include the ones who were from other districts but succumbed at the hospitals in Trichy.

The crematorium situated near the banks of Cauvery river on normal days witnesses the cremation of four to five bodies per day, but it witnessed a surge, of up to 15 per day post Covid-19. As one of the two burners in the crematorium developed a snag recently, officials said only one burner is being used.

On Saturday, while the families of two Covid-19 casualties were waiting for cremation, another deceased person was brought in. Claiming that the body arrived from MGMGH was that of an influential family, attempts were made to bypass the two families. “Crematorium is not properly managed, can understand the workers were under immense stress since the outbreak but the dead bodies should be cremated without showing any preferential treatments,” C Muthumariappan, a relative of a deceased victim said.

Trichy corporation officials said a section of locals far from suburbs are interested to cremate their family members in Oyamari for sentimental reasons, to dispose ashes in Cauvery river, thus causing a bottleneck. Officials said that the snag developed in Oyamari crematorium will be rectified soon. To reduce the waiting time, the civic body said a new electric crematorium in Srirangam is to be opened for use shortly. “We are planning to use Oyamari crematorium exclusively for cremating Covid-19 positive patients,” said the corporation commissioner S Sivasubramanian said.

302,['27/07/2020'],Experts: Covid-19 may cause cardiac injury too,"Lucknow: Normally known to attack the lungs, the coronavirus could also be adversely affecting the heart. Concerns over the impact of pandemic infection have been raised by the Cardiological Society of India. “Different studies across the world have indicated that about 20-30% of the patients hospitalized due to coronavirus suffered a cardiac injury,” said vice-chairperson CSI and senior faculty at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Prof Satyendra Tewari. Cardiac injury is defined as raised levels of cardiac troponin, which is a protein released in the body by injured heart muscle.The CSI, in its statement guideline published in the Indian Heart Journal, cited multiple studies to explain the mechanism of cardiac injury. It stated that the majority of cardiovascular events in patients with Covid-19 are the result of severe immune overreaction by the body called cytokine storm. Simply put, when a person is infected by the novel coronavirus his or her immune system tries to fight back.Too many cytokines — small proteins important in cell signalling — are released into the blood too quickly, thus leading to a cytokine reform. This has been linked to many complications, including heart attack in patients with Covid-19. Respiratory failure and lack of oxygen in blood — other known effects of Covid19 — can also impair the heart’s functioning. Heightened inflammation due to Covid-19 can cause clotting of blood which can cause heart attack, experts said. Many researchers have linked Covid-19 with myocarditis or heart muscle damage. According to CSI guidelines, this can happen due to direct infiltration of the novel coronavirus into the heart muscle but mainly it is attributed to the cytokine storm occurring in response to the systemic inflammation.“Cardiac injury usually becomes evident in the second week of the illness and manifests as ECG changes, troponin elevation, ventricular dysfunction or arrhythmias. Any of the above mechanisms which cause cardiac injury can potentially lead to heart failure. Also, the hemodynamic stress and inflammatory milieu can worsen pre-existing heart failure,” CSI said. Several studies conducted in China and Europe suggested the death rate among persons with pre-existing heart disease, who get Covid-19, is much higher compared to others. “Case fatality rates reported are 6% for hypertensives, 7.3% for diabetics and 10.5% among those with cardiovascular disease, while the overall case fatality rate was only 2.3%,” studies indicate.Dr Ambuj Roy, professor of cardiology at AIIMS, who co-authored the CSI guidelines, said that people with heart diseases should practice isolation meticulously, frequent hand washing and social distancing.“Due to travel restrictions, many patients with pre-existing heart disease, for example heart failure, are not able to visit doctors. My advice is they shouldn’t discontinue medications. They can contact their doctor on phone and, based on their opinion, continue with medications,” he said.",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/experts-covid-19-may-cause-cardiac-injury-too/articleshow/77188165.cms

So far, Pernem has recorded the highest seasonal rainfall with a cumulative total of 2,507mm of rainfall (as of 8.30am on July 26) while Mapusa has recorded the lowest with 1,909mm rainfall.

Currently the impact of the monsoon is weak over Goa, but with its revival predicted by the end of the coming week, rainfall activity is expected to pick up. This may enable all rain gauge stations in the state to record a seasonal total rainfall of over 2,000mm by the end of July. In 2019, this milestone was achieved on August 6.

From July 1 to July 26, a total of 104% of July’s total normal rainfall has been achieved in Goa as compared to 107% in 2019, data shared by IMD revealed.

“The July normal rainfall of 1,069.8mm was crossed on July 18 this year as opposed to July 24, last year,” Rahul said.

While no weather warning has been issued for July 27 and 28, IMD has forecast that heavy rain is very likely to occur at isolated places on July 29.

A weather warning has been issued for high sea and other coasts beyond 75km from the coast. Wind speed reaching 50-60 km per hour is likely to prevail over the southwest Arabian Sea and adjoining west-central Arabian Sea up to July 29, IMD’s weather bulletin said.

Fishermen have been advised not to venture into the sea during this period.

304,['27/07/2020'],Special flight brings in 11 persecuted in Afghanistan,"Nidan Singh Sachdeva, who was abducted from a gurdwara in Paktia last month, at IGI Airport in New Delhi on Su... Read More

NEW DELHI: In the middle of a global pandemic, a flight from Afghanistan on Sunday brought back to Delhi 60-year-old Nidan Singh Sachdeva, who was abducted from Paktia province of Kabul in June and released from captivity on July 18 after a month of torture. Along with him were 10 others from the Sikh and Hindu communities, including children, who reached Delhi seeking refuge from the threat of religious persecution.

The Indian government facilitated the return of Sachdeva, one more Hindu-Afghan national and nine people from one Sikh family (five of them children) who lost other members of their household in the terrorist attack on a gurdwara in Kabul’s Shor Bazaar in March.

Sachdeva, like many Sikh and Hindu minorities in Afghanistan, came to India with his wife and children in the early 1990s to escape persecution and targeted attacks. Sachdeva goes back to Paktia every year to visit a gurdwara in his native place as he is the primary caretaker. This year too, despite the lockdown, he took a flight on April 13 and was soon abducted. His family wrote to PM Modi seeking the Centre’s intervention.

Sachdeva told TOI, “I will not go back again now. I have been tortured for a month and beaten up so many times by my abductors that my whole body hurts even now.” He and the 10 others will be kept in quarantine in Gurdwara Rakabganj guest house run by the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee.

The Afghan Sikhs and Hindus, if they choose to exercise it, will have the right to seek Indian citizenship under the CAA. This was indicated by the MEA recently.This is the first time the Indian government has openly pointed to the CAA as a route to citizenship for minorities in neighbouring countries. The Afghan government was initially indignant, but repeated abductions and terror attacks targeting the minority Hindu and Sikh communities in Afghanistan might make it difficult for them to oppose it.

For nine others who arrived, it will be a new life born of tragedy. Balwant Kaur recalls how both her sons who were sewadars (caretakers) were killed in the Shor Bazaar attack. She points at a 14-year-old girl sitting next to her who is the daughter of one of her deceased sons. It turns out that girl was abducted from outside her house some days ago.

On their arrival, ministry of external affairs issued a statement to say that “around eleven members, belonging to the Sikh and Hindu minority community of Afghanistan, arrived in India today. Nidan Singh Sachdeva, who was released from captivity on July 18, is also among those who reached Delhi today.”

305,['27/07/2020'],Prices shoot up as Sunday markets return to business with depleted stocks in Kolkata,"KOLKATA: Back-to-back lockdowns seem to have adversely hit the supply chain . Most of the markets in the city saw a handful of vendors selling old stock at a premium rate. Majority of grocery shops remained shut due to supply shortage. It did not feel like a Sunday market at all.Some vegetables like tomato and drumsticks (sajne data) touched Rs 100 a kg. Brinjal soared to Rs 80 a kg. Green chillies, particularly the Beldanga variety, were sold at Rs 200 a kg. It is mainly due to semi-functional wholesale markets and non-functional ‘haats’ in the rural Bengal from where wholesale markets source their items for trade.Because of weekend disruptions in the supply chain, a large number of vendors preferred to skip business on Sunday and those, who were there, tried to sell old stocks in a bid to clear what they had carried forward from Friday. The price, however, remained very high and vendors said that fresh stocks were due to arrive in the markets on Monday.Vendors have also prepared a procurement routine to adjust to the staggered lockdown regimen that the state is adopting. Not only vegetables, buyers were also upset about the quality and variety of fish available on a Sunday. At Lake Market, where the demand for tiger prawns soars on Sundays, the availability was poor. Retailers complained that supplies were not coming in from North 24 Parganas and Midnapore.Only the small variety of prawns were available and sold at Rs 350-400 a kg, up from the usual Rs 270 a kg. Most buyers had to buy rohu and katla at a steep price. “Can you imagine a Sunday market where sellers are sitting with such a little variety? I wanted to buy pomphret, but most sellers didn’t have it. Those who did, had a few pieces of the bigger variety left that were sold at Rs 750 a kg, up by nearly Rs 100,”, rued Chaitali Bagchi, a retired banker who lives on Fern Road. In case of rohu and katla, the prices were up by at least Rs 80-Rs 100 a kilo.The availability of hilsa was another sore point across markets. “It’s the height of monsoons and you are still getting the 500-600 gram varieties that are selling at Rs 900 a kg,” said Sandip Banerjee, a liaison executive with a real estate brand, who lives on Harish Mukherjee Road.People complained about the unavailability of Chandramukhi variety of potatoes on Sunday. The Jyoti variety too was sold at Rs 30 a kg.Most fruit sellers had vanished from the markets on Sunday. “The staggered lockdown has affected movement of truckloads of fruits because they are being stopped at various locations. Price of majority of mango varieties has soared beyond Rs 100 a kg,” said Anwar Sheikh, a fruit seller at New Market.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77189047,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-339009,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/prices-shoot-up-as-sunday-mkts-return-to-biz-with-depleted-stocks/articleshow/77187866.cms

A video of the incident has now gone viral on social media, attracting appreciation from different quarters.

Incessant rain in the area has caused rivers and tributaries to swell. On Sunday morning, a young man named Samadhan Wankhede had gone to the banks of the Bhordi river to look at the gushing water. However, he slipped and fell into the water, and started drowning. People standing on the banks cried for help, but were too scared to enter the water given the strong current. One man tried, but quickly returned to the safety of the banks.

However, 22-year-old snake rescuer Akshay Vidhwans, ignoring the warning of other Andhari residents, jumped in to rescue the drowning youth. As Vidhwans struggled to save Wankhede and avoid being washed away himself, other residents brought a rope and threw it towards the duo to give Vidhwans something to hold on to. They then pulled the duo out of the water.

Vital Badakh, a Kannad resident said, “Due to the strong water currents, people feared that both the young men would drown, but Vidhwans managed the difficult feat.” He was later felicitated by local residents.

That’s when they decided to do something about it.“We had started crowdfunding for relief work and had some funds left from that time.

RAJKOT: A 30-year-old man , who has been offering his services at a prominent Jain derasar in Soni Bazaar locality, was arrested for allegedly stealing cash from the donation box on Saturday night.

Police said Jayesh Baria (28), who was arrested on Sunday, has been serving as the helper to the main priest for the past eight years.

“Baria told us that he was badly in need of money, which prompted him to commit the crime,” said VK Gadhvi, inspector with Rajkot detection of crime branch. Baria turned off the CCTV cameras installed inside the derasar and then committed the theft of Rs 46,000 from the box. However, he was caught turning off the cameras. However, his face was not visible as Baria had worn a white hooded raincoat resembling a PPE kit.

“During spot investigation, we concluded that no one could have broken into the temple from outside and therefore we suspected that it was the job of an insider. We started interrogating the temple staff one by one. When Baria’s turn came, he broke down and confessed to the crime,” added Gadhvi.

Baria then handed over the stolen money to the police which he had kept on the terrace of the derasar. The derasar, ‘Mani Bhadra Dada nu Derasar’, is 200 years old.

312,['27/07/2020'],"Lonar Lake may turn into ghost structure, warns HC","Nagpur: The historic Lonar Lake would turn into a ghost structure if it isn’t conserved while developing the area on the outer side of its vicinity, the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court warned in its recent order.

“If the development of lake and its surrounding takes place without any care for conservation, a time will come when it will sound like a home without children and a ghost structure without any life force in it. There would remain nothing more to build, develop and enjoy as a crater lake, the very heartbeat of development would have gone,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor tersely stated.

While hearing the PIL by petitioners – Kirti Nipankar and others – through counsel Anand Parchure, the bench clarified that the development should only be in the context of conservation of a unique lake and appreciation of its beauty, biology, geology and aesthetic value. It shouldn’t be in reference to any economic development.

In a detailed order pronounced after a marathon hearing, the judges said there’s some confusion regarding the object and purpose of this petition among stakeholders. “Ostensibly, the PIL is filed with an aim of the lake’s preservation and conservation. Gradually, some other issues, though appearing to be quite distinct and divergent, cropped up. In reality, they’re intimately connected.”

Stressing that lake’s development is essentially moored in its conservation, the judges said all agencies involved in the case must work in tandem. Agencies like PWD, MTDC, Forest Department, NHAI, MSRDC, ASI, along with the Buldhana collector are respondents in the case.

“All these agencies must sit together and sort out various issues which are interlinked and interconnected so that what comes out of such efforts would only ensure the lake’s benefit,” the judges said.

Stressing that detailed examination of all issues involved with lake’s preservation is needed, the judges however clarified they can’t resolve all of them. “We think it appropriate to place the responsibility in this regard on the collector. We direct her to look into all issues and give specific suggestions so that further direction can be categorically issued,” they said, while directing Suman Chandra to complete the entire exercise before the next hearing.

Explaining that issues in the PIL may look to be different and may also appear to be running counter to the original object, the judges said it’s only an illusion. “The concept of development can’t be starved off and dehors core issue of the lake’s preservation and conservation. If a lake is preserved and conserved for posterity, then only its development will have any meaning,” the judges said.

The accused was identified as Rajeev Dua, who, according to the police, hatched a plan to kidnap the owner of a renowned construction company based in Sambalpur district of Odisha.

Based on the alert given by Odisha Police, the accused was arrested near Dobhal Chowk in Raipur area of Dehradun where he was hiding from police, according to Aishwarya Pal, in charge of SOG Dehradun.

Originally from Dehradun, Rajeev Dua had migrated to Sambalpur in 2018 and had opened a clothing business with the help of his uncle. However, the business could not take off and he found himself under huge debt. “After facing losses in business, Rajeev met two persons — Saif and Raja — who were also facing financial issues. They together hatched a plan to kidnap businessman Naresh Agarwal. On July 10, they abducted Agarwal in Sambalpur and took him to a rented flat,” according to inspector Pal.

Later, the kidnappers panicked after they came to know that the police had launched a massive search operation across Sambalpur to trace Naresh Agarwal. Fearing arrest, they left the kidnapped businessman near his home and fled.

Accused Dua has confessed to the police that he left Odisha on July 18 and came to Dehradun and has been hiding since then.

315,['27/07/2020'],No progress in Marathwada ambulance purchase proposal,"Aurangabad: Four months on, a proposal to purchase ambulances for the rural areas in Marathwada as part of the Human Development Mission has not made any progress.

As per the proposal, each of the 30 relatively backward talukas in Beed, Hingoli, Parbhani, Nanded and Jalna districts were to get an ambulance. The Marathwada Development Board had submitted a proposal to the state health department in March.

Ashok Belkhode, an expert member (health) of the board, said the necessary purchase would have proven beneficial for the region amid the ongoing outbreak. “The state government had sanctioned Rs 50 crore for the Marathwada Development Board, a part of which was to be utilised to buy the ambulances. The health department is sitting on the proposal and is refusing to give technical sanction for the purchase,” he said.

Besides ambulance purchase, Marathwada Development Board had also submitted a proposal for purchasing equipment and machinery to strenghenting the primay health centres (PHCs) in rural areas.

State health minister Rajesh Tope said the technical issues delaying the process of ambulance purchase would be addressed soon. “The purchase will be expedited. The state government has made a budgetary provision to buy 500 ambulances for different parts of the state, including Marathwada. This purchase will be done soon,” said Tope.

BENGALURU: The massive Covid Care Centre (CCC) at Bangalore International Exhibition Centre (BIEC), which was in the eye of controversies, will officially begin operations from Monday afternoon. Asymptomatic patients are slated to be treated at the facility.

CCC in-charge and senior IAS officer Rajendra Kumar Kataria, who was at the facility on Sunday, said they have conducted a dry run of the CCC and it has been successful. “We are going to open one hall which will have 1,500 beds. As 1,000 patients fill, we will open another hall. If there is inflow, we will open other halls for patients,” he said.

The facility has about 6,500 beds, but considering home isolation is a crucial arm of the state’s Covid-19 management strategy and there are multiple CCCs in the city, it’s unlikely to see a rush of patients.

“The lessons that I learnt while operationalising nine CCCs have helped in creating this infrastructure well. We have tied up with nearby hospitals and ambulances will be stationed to ferry patients in need, while doctors, nurses, other medical staff and logistics are in place,” Kataria added.

The facility is expected to ease the pressure on hospitals within the city and free up hospital beds for serious Covid patients and non-Covid cases.

According to Kataria, about 250-300 people are getting into CCCs every day in the city and about 250-270 are being discharged.

Initially, the plan was to have 10,100 beds at the facility. But later it was reduced to 6,500 beds after the state government brought in the home isolation policy and hotels and apartments began creating their own centres to house infected people.

317,['27/07/2020'],MP: Engineer nabbed for blowing up six ATMs,"The accused in police custody

BHOPAL: A civil engineer, who tried to crack UPSC and state PSC exams, has been arrested as the kingpin of a gang that blew up six ATMs in Bundelkhand, looting nearly Rs 48 lakh in the past year.

The gang of six was arrested on Sunday and Rs 25.5 lakh recovered. Fake currency of Rs 3 lakh face value, two pistols and explosives were also seized. The alleged mastermind, 28-year-old Devendra Patel, had taught himself about explosives on projects to excavate wells, and watched TV crime series to “get ideas”, said police.

Police swooped down on the gang members within a week of their last blast-and-loot strike. On July 19, two men had blown up an ATM in Simaria village of Panna and looted Rs 23 lakh. Exactly a month earlier, an ATM in Damoh was looted the same way.

After the July heist, police set up an SIT. Meticulous detective work and timely alerts from informers helped police identify the suspects.

Police say ringleader Devendra Patel is a native of Damoh who worked as a civil engineer in Bina, and had “studied” blasts to excavate wells in rural areas.

“In the last one year, the gang was involved in triggering blasts in Jabalpur, Katni, Damoh and Panna,” said Sagar Range IG Anil Sharma.

The gang would recce ATMs in far-flung villages, and choose the unguarded ones. The Simaria one had a guard, though, who was held at gunpoint.

“They would plant explosives near the cash tray and detonators behind it. The detonators would be connected with a wire to a bike battery to trigger the blast,” the IG said.

Unfortunately, they lie unused for want of medical staff even as city experiences a shotage of beds for Covid-19 patients.For fourth day, admission of patients was delayed by one or two days in city as well as in Nagpur Rural. With capacity in AIIMS and Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) about to exhaust, the civic body converted MLA Hostel Quarantine Centre into Covid Care Centre (CCC) which too got full.Newly opened CCC at Shalinitai Meghe Hospital also got full quickly. NMC had to hurriedly convert VNIT Hostel Quarantine Centre into CCC. The civic body is planning to open more CCCs for asymptomatic positive patients.Amid all this, NMC’s five DCHCs at Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya (IGR), KT Nagar, Sadar, Pachpaoli and Isolation Hospital are lying idle. They are meant for treatment of patients with moderate symptoms. There are even 50 ICU beds in them. They could reduce burden of GMCH, IGGMCH and AIIMS.An NMC official told TOI, “DCHCs require over 300 doctors and paramedical staff which is not available with NMC. In April, the NMC had requested the state government to provide the staff on emergency basis. NMC write time and again to the state’s public health department for providing staff but is yet to receive it.”The public health department had started a recruitment drive but it received less response. Even those who were selected are yet to join.NMC is having around 150 medical staff which is used to run three hospitals, two diagnostic centres and 15 health centres. They are engaged in containing Covid-19 since March. Some doctors are holding upto three posts like zonal medical officer for contact tracing, testing and containment zones of entire zone apart from being incharge of health centre and also quarantine centre.NMC is having 347 medical staff for operating 26 Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHCs). They cannot be diverted to DCHCs as UPHCs take care of non-Covid patients in large numbers.NMC is also using staff from state’s health department at CCCs and quarantine centres. It had to send asymptomatic high-risk contacts of positive patients for home isolation due to lack of staff for opening new quarantine centres.Developed with funds sanctioned by the state government under National/state Disaster Relief Fund, DCHCs are having latest diagnostic machines, beds and facilities on par with private hospitals.An official from state’s public health department said they can be brought into use if number of symptomatic patients rises. “At present, there is need for CCCs as over 85% patients are asymptomatic. GMCH, IGGMCH and AIIMS can cater to symptomatic patients if asymptomatic ones are shifted to CCCs,” he said.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmcs-5-covid-hosps-idle-for-want-of-staff-even-as-bed-shortage-bites/articleshow/77187874.cms

The Nepalese officials said that they held a meeting with those who have encroached the area and asked them not to start any work there. They added that further steps would be taken after a meeting with their Indian counterparts.

On Wednesday, the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) had prevented a few Nepalese citizens from barricading no-man’s land along the border and planting saplings there. They had also found that border pillar 811 was missing from the spot. A meeting of senior district-level officials belonging to both the countries was then convened and the Nepalese had assured that necessary steps would be taken to evict the encroachers.

Champawat DM SN Pande said that the district administration had sent a report to the state home department and also lodged a complaint with the authorities of Kanchanpur in Nepal. “We had asked them to visit the area to get an idea of the ground reality. Another meeting of officials from both the countries is likely next week to discuss the issue.”

The DM said, “The field survey teams from both countries had held a meeting in January. At the time, the Indian team had wanted the survey to start from Tanakpur and the Nepalese from Lakhimpur Kheri. However, the survey could not be held at all due to the Covid-19 pandemic.”

Meanwhile, there were reports of unidentified miscreants causing trouble in the area.

The student claimed to be a close relative top Gujarat politicians and flaunted his political as well as police connections to threaten the woman.

The student was detained for allegedly ramming his car to a woman cyclist on Nirmala Road in Rajkot on early Saturday morning. He was later let off by the police as the woman did not lodge any complaint in this regard.

Though no police case was registered, the incident has created a sensation as its video clip has gone viral on WhatsApp and social media.

In the video clip, the student is heard hurling abuses and saying, “Vijay Rupani is my uncle and Rajkot deputy commissioner of police Manoharsinh Jadeja is my father’s friend. I come from the family of advocates. You can’t do any harm to me.”

The video shows that when a passer-by tries to intervene, the student is heard threatening him too: “Don’t involve yourself in this matter, or else I will frame you in a police case.”

Sources said that the student is not related to any politician but only wanted to intimidate the hapless woman.

LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath and chief secretary RK Tewari on Sunday carried out a whirlwind tour of districts which are not only facing surge in Covid-19 cases but are also reeling under flood-like situation.

While Yogi took stock of the situation in Gorakhpur, Ballia, Sant Kabir Nagar and Varanasi, Tewari visited Mirzapur and Prayagraj to look into preparedness against coronavirus crisis.

Yogi instructed irrigation department officials to keep close vigil on barrages and ensure none of them is breached.

Yogi started from his home turf Gorakhpur by conducting an aerial survey of Sahjanwa region which is facing flood-like situation after a rise in water level of rivers. He asked district authorities of Gorakhpur, Sant Kabir Nagar, Ballia and Varanasi to arrange boats in adequate numbers in flood-affected areas.

He also inspected Lalit Narayan Mishra Hospital and AIIMS Gorakhpur which are being converted into L-2 hospitals to take care of Covid-19 patients. Officials informed the CM that a 100-bed Covid hospital was being prepared in two phases at AIIMS.

Chief secretary RK Tewari inspected Mirzapur and Prayagraj to assess the situation. On Saturday, Tewari had visited Kanpur and Jhansi where high number of Covid-19 cases are being reported.

Meanwhile, additional chief secretary, information, Awanish Awasthi said at least 1.9 lakh teams have reached out to over 1.3 crore households covering 6 crore population under the door-to-door survey to assess the spread of coronavirus.

Awasthi said the state government was giving thrust to antigen test which was being conducted on a large scale. “People may undergo antigen test to know their health status,” he said.

He said besides waging a battle against the pandemic, the state government was also arranging adequate jobs for the people. Citing the figures of rural development department, Awasthi said nearly 21.9 lakh people were being engaged under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS).

“Under the scheme, which resumed from April 21, as many as 17 crore man-days of jobs have already been generated. At least 7.9 lakh micro, small and medium scale functional industries have engaged more than 49 lakh people,” Awasthi added.

NEW DELHI: Till May 10, Abdul Qadir was a contract teacher at a primary school under South Delhi Municipal Corporation. Now, he is busy selling pakoras and jalebis in his home state Bihar.

Qadir, who is over 40 years and has 80% locomotor disability, is the sole breadwinner for his family and isn’t left with any other option as his contract hasn’t been renewed. And he is not alone — at least 3,000 more contract teachers in Delhi government and corporation schools are struggling. Their contracts are usually renewed on July 1 every year; but with schools shut due to Covid-19, these teachers are staring at an uncertain future.

“Right now we are only getting assurances that they will look into it,” said Qadir, who was a contract teacher at a corporation school near New Friends Colony since 2003. He has completed elementary teaching education from Jamia Millia Islamia and was earning Rs 40,000 per month.

Qadir was living in south Delhi’s Zakir Nagar with his family — wife, an eight-year-old daughter and a one-year-old son. They left for Qadir’s village in Siwan district a month ago as it became difficult to manage expenses in Delhi.

“The money was getting exhausted so I had to find an alternative. I now make pakoras and jalebis. There’s tough competition in this too and the return is not even 100%,” said Qadir. “I cannot even give tuitions to students as social distancing norms will have to be followed.”

Qadir is also worried about his daughter’s education. She was attending a private school in Delhi. “I have no idea whether I will be able to pay her fees. She has no reading materials here. I don’t know what to do.”

Contract teachers have met lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and civic officials for a solution. “But nothing has been done so far,” said Qadir, whose age makes it impossible for him to write any competitive examination for another job.

Despite repeated attempts, the south corporation has refused to comment.

Many contract teachers have taken to social media to highlight their plight and have been writing postcards to the authorities demanding renewal of their contracts.

Bhopal: Sunday, the second day of the 10-day lockdown in Bhopal, was quieter than the first day. It was also the third Sunday lockdown of the month, which had found overwhelming response from the people on previous two Sundays, and July 26 was no different.

On Saturday, the first day of the lockdown, there was some traffic on the road between 10 am and 11 am and later in the evening from 5 pm to 7 pm as people, who went to office, were on the road during the period. But Sunday.was a holiday for all and only those who really had some urgent work came out of their houses. However, the district administration's assurance that the BMC would ensure regular supply.of vegetables in residential areas doesn't seem to have moved the civic administration into action. No vegetable vans with the BMC banner was seen during the previous lockdown in the city.

When asked about provisions for vegetable supply, district admimistration spokesperson, Arun Rathore, said that attempt was being made to revive the old system in which vendors authorised by the BMC used to sell vegetables in different locations. He also said that temporary markets on the outskirts of the city will be back in business till the lockdown. SDM, Huzur, and SDM, Kolar, have been given the responsibility to make arrangements for the vegetable markets. The grocery bag, which the food safety department provided to the Sanchi Milk Parlours for sale during the previous round of the lockdown when grocery shops were closed as now, is not available either. However, some milk parlours have stock of grocery on their own for sale. People, at least for now, are not complaining about closure of grocery/vegetable shops, since the lockdown was not abrupt and they had a couple of days to stock up essentials. In fact, some of the people TOI talked to, were happy that grocery/vegetable shops were closed.

“There was crowd on the streets after the initial days of lockdown-1 essentially because vegetable/fruit vendors and grocery shops were allowed to operate. As of now, people have enough of grocery and vegetables. May be after a couple of days, people will start looking out for vegetables. I hope by then BMC will have a system in place to cater to them,” said Dinesh Saxena, a resident of Trilanga.

Precise level and smoother soil surface facilitate less water consumption in land preparation. It helps maintain uniform moisture environment for crops making it conducive for germination and growth of the crop. This will also help control weeds in the field, they said.

Despite its numerous benefits, farmers have not been using the leveller and instead going for manual labour spending more money. It was in this backdrop that the farmers production group from Vazhavanthankottai came forward to purchase the leveller, said A Panneerselvem, a farmer and president of the group.

“If we use laser leveller, one acre of land can be levelled in an hour and it costs only Rs 1,200. If farmers engage labourers, they would need to engage 10 of them paying Rs 400 each. They would also take half a day to complete the work. There are 100 farmers in our group and all of them have been utilizing the leveller effectively”, Panneerselvam added.

The equipment was bought from a Coimbatore-based company for Rs 4.2 lakh with the subsidy provided to the group. A member of the group, Sakthivel, said machine planting was the best option as the cost of transplantation using labourers was exceedingly high. However, in order to go for machine planting, field levelling was very important.

330,['27/07/2020'],Proposed Pancheshwar Dam along Indo-Nepal border will put flora &amp; fauna at risk: Report,"Pithoragarh: The recently-released State of Environment Report compiled by the Uttarakhand Pollution Control Board in collaboration with GB Pant Agriculture and Technical University has claimed that the proposed Pancheshwar Dam along the Indo-Nepal border will put more than 300 species of flora and fauna in danger.

The report points out that the dam will have an adverse impact on around 43 mammals and 193 varieties of flora along with 30 species of fish and 70 species of birds found in the region. Several environmentalists have also said that the proposed dam would be an ecological disaster for the area.

India and Nepal had jointly proposed a multi-purpose project on Kali river at Pancheshwar in Champawat district and the project has been in works for a long time now. According to this project, construction of a 315-metre-high dam is proposed which will likely help in the production of 6,720 megawatt of electricity and also provide water for irrigation in Uttar Pradesh.

The report also says that 87 villages of Almora, Champawat, and Pithoragarh will submerge in the lake if the dam is built. “The level of oxygen is already so low in the lakes of the region that it threatens the existence of many aquatic and amphibious animals. The dam will hinder the natural flow of the Kali river. The government did not conduct any study on the environmental effect during construction of the Tehri Dam and a similar negligence can be seen with the Pancheshwar Dam project as well,” said Bimal Bhai, environmentalist and convenor of social organisation “Matu”.

“The villages that will be submerged due to the dam have fertile land and rich biodiversity. The government should assess the environmental impact of the dam on the region,” said Pradeep Tamta, Rajya Sabha MP from Uttarakhand.

332,['27/07/2020'],KA theatre college in talks to shift to old PWD building,"PANAJI: The old PWD office near Rua de Ourem, Panaji, may soon become the new premises for the Kala Academy ’s (KA) Goa College of Theatre Arts. Chairman of KA, Govind Gaude along with the college management, is in talks with the state government to grant them the heritage building to be utilised as the college campus.

“We intend to have all of the classes there as an alternate arrangement since the Kala Academy building sometimes has problems. However, we cannot make any changes to the building since the matter is in the court. To tackle this, we have decided to move to another building in Panaji,” minister for art and culture, Govind Gaude said.

Last year TOI had published a series of reports on the state government’s plans to demolish the iconic open-air auditorium of the Kala Academy, built by Charles Correa. The high court of Goa at Bombay then took suo moto cognizance of news reports and the matter is now in court.

Officials from the institute said that the college requires 30 to 40-seater classrooms, a stage and large spaces for drama and practical lessons. However, conducting classes in the campus faces several distractions with the Kala Academy constantly engaged for shows and events like the International film festival of India (Iffi) taking up space.

“The art gallery leaks and part of the DMK auditorium floods every monsoon. Such obstacles prove to be a problem to use the spaces to conduct classes,” officials said.

The PWD building which is perched on the Rua de Ourem creek between the old and new Patto bridges is being used as one of the multiple venues of the annual Serendipity Arts Festival. For ten days, this space is used to showcase art and culture with visual arts projects indoors and classical performances but is un-utilised for the rest of the year.

“The theatre arts college must get priority over the festival. We require the infrastructure,” Gaude said.

The state government has handed the old PWD premises to Smart City Panaji officials who in turn have handed it to the Serendipity organisers as one of the festival venues.

The officials are claiming that the elephant died as it slipped while probably trying to break the branches of trees for eating.

A proper postmortem of the body could not be done to ascertain the exact cause of the death as the carcass was almost two weeks old, according to the newly-appointed RTR director DK Singh. “The spot survey indicates that the elephant slipped, broke its neck, and died. The intensive postmortem of the animal could not be done as its carcass had decayed,” said Singh.

The official, however, evicted any possibility of poaching as the site had broken twigs and crushed grass indicating an accidental death of the tusker. When asked about the delay in finding out the carcass by the staff, Singh said, “Almost ten days ago, our staff had patrolled the area and upon revisiting it on Friday, they came across a pungent smell there and found the carcass,” added Singh.

On the other hand, one of the rogue elephants of RTR had been crossing the broken fencing of RTR and entering into a residential area causing a ruckus, especially among the residents of nearby Bilkeshwar Colony. On Sunday, it broke down a school wall and turned two parked two-wheelers turtle. The movement of the jumbo in Bilkeshwar has been going on for the past two weeks. “There are plans to erect a boundary. Also, our staff has already removed the elephant from that location. It has not caused any harm to humans as such.” added Singh.

CHANDIGARH: After the enforcement directorate widened its probe into the assets of trusts linked to the Nehru-Gandhi family earlier this month, the Haryana government has written to the urban local bodies department to investigate such details with immediate effect.

The recent orders from chief secretary Keshni Anand Arora to the additional chief secretaries are consequent to the communication from the Union government regarding probe into foreign contributions received by the Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust. Two other trusts named are Rajiv Gandhi Foundation and Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust.

The trusts linked to the Nehru-Gandhi family had acquired assets in Haryana between 2004 and 2014, when Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led government was in power.

The scrutiny is on allotment of an institutional plot in Gurugram for setting up an hospital, alleged re-allotment of an institutional plot in the name of Associated Journals Limited and certain sale deeds involving Congress president Sonia Gandhi ’s son-in-law Robert Vadra .

KOLKATA: No shraddh rituals will be held on Monday for dancer Amala Shankar , who passed away in Kolkata on July 24 at the age of 101. This decision was motivated not by the pandemic, but inspired by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose . The Padma Bhushan recipient never really believed in rituals like shraddh. Respecting that, a very private get-together will be organized on Monday evening at her daughter Mamata Shankar ’s Rajdanga residence.

With no priest, ritual or formal gathering, it will just be a simple occasion for remembering the icon, her legacy and contribution to dance pedagogy. Her grandson Ratul Shankar said, “Dida used to talk about a conversation she once had with Netaji. She was inspired by how Netaji had said that after independence, ceremonies like shraddh and annaprasan should be banned. In case of a shraddh, the person is absent. Dida felt that the entire exercise didn’t always do justice to the relationship shared with those engaging in the rituals and the deceased. In case of an annaprasan, she said the baby is too small to understand or remember anything. Keeping that in mind, we are not holding any rituals,” he said.

Had there not been a pandemic now, the plans would still have remained the same. “We would not have gone for an elaborate ceremony of treating guests after a memorial service. When we had the annaprasan of my nephew, it was also a very private affair with just the family being present. That, too, was done adhering to Dida’s beliefs,” he added.

“We also have the responsibility to abide by the norms of social distancing. People can pay their tributes from their homes. We are all disciples of Sai Baba . On Monday evening, perhaps there will be bhajan recitals by family members,” he said, insisting how her life needed to be “celebrated”.

The family recalled how she had an eidetic memory even in the final years of her life. “If she mentioned a particular size of a screen used for a production, the figure would never change in subsequent references. A fantastic cook, she would insist that vegetables be chopped keeping their cooking time in mind. Once ma and I were entering her flat in Mandeville Gardens, when we noticed that the domestic help had kept some pieces of paper at the corner of the door after having dusted the floor. Checking the papers, we found among them a letter sent to her and Dadu ( Uday Shankar ) by Mahatma Gandhi wishing them on their wedding. Thankfully, we noticed it and saved it. It was incredible to hear Dida casually share her encounters with luminaries. Every interaction with her was a rewarding experience,” he said.

The phones haven’t stopped ringing at the Shankar residence since Friday. People have been calling to share their memories of her and also mentioned having old videos and photographs of her.

“We have been asking them to send over copies of such items,” he added.

Even though the events were muted and the crowd wasn’t allowed to gather at any venue, state residents paid homage to the soldiers who died in the battle against Pakistan.

On the day, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat paid his respect to the war martyrs in the state capital. Speaking during the event at Dehradun’s Gandhi Park, CM Rawat said that the soldiers from Uttarakhand have a proud history of serving the country. “Dozens of soldiers sacrificed their lives to protect the country in the Kargil War. Our soldiers were fighting the enemy in a difficult terrain and equally challenging climate. Each and every person of the state salutes the valour shown by our soldiers on the battlefield,” the CM said.

Former Army officers and jawans, district officials as well as senior police officials also attended the ceremonies held in several cities and towns. More than 500 soldiers lost their lives in the Kargil War. Of these, at least 75 were from Uttarakhand. Thirty-seven soldiers of the state were awarded the gallantry medals as well.

Meanwhile, in Nainital, a wreath laying ceremony was held in the Shaheed Park at Haldwani. The ceremony was attended by the officials of the Sashastra Seema Bal, police officials, and former Army officers. Speaking at the event, Nainital SSP Sunil Kumar Meena said, “Soldiers from Uttarakhand have earned a name for themselves in various wars and in the Kargil battle too, the soldiers captured the strategically important locations even though the enemies were sitting at heights.”

Families of the soldiers also remembered their sons who fought and died in the battle. Gomti Devi, mother of martyr Surendra Singh (22), said she still visits the memorial built for him in Premnagar daily. “I am proud that my son died for the country. For the last 20 years, I have been visiting the memorial and the temple built in his name near our house but I wish my son was alive to see the country’s victory in Kargil,” she said.

Bhopal: BJP Lok Sabha member from Bhopal, Pragya Singh Thakur has appealed to the people to recite `Hanuman Chalisa' (a hymn in praise of Lord Hanuman) five times a day till August 5, which she believes will rid the world of the coronavirus pandemic. The `bhoomi pujan' or the foundation laying ceremony for the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya is to take place on August 5 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Congress said Pragya should help the poor during Covid crisis instead of taking political benefit of the Ram Temple issue.

""Let all of us together make a spiritual effort to wish people good health and end the coronavirus epidemic. Recite 'Hanuman Chalisa' five times a day at your home from July 25 to August 5. Conclude this ritual by lighting lamps on August 5 and offering ‘aarti’ to Lord Ram at home. We will be free from coronavirus,"" tweeted Thakur.

The BJP leader also posted a video on the social media site in which she said the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh is making efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus by imposing lockdown in Bhopal till August 4.

“Though the lockdown will be over on August 4, this ritual (recitation of the Hanuman Chalisa) will end on August 5, when ‘bhoomi pujan’ for Ram temple in Ayodhya will be performed. We will celebrate that day like Diwali,” she said, adding, ""When Hindus from across the country recite the ‘Hanuman Chalisa’ in one voice, it will definitely work and we will be free from coronavirus. This is your prayer to Lord Ram.""

As the world awaits a cure for Covid-19 and people seek respite from the ten-day lockdown, Thakur's idea has sparked verbal spat between the Congress and the ruling BJP. Former Congress minister PC Sharma said that after remaining absent from the scene for the last four months, Pragya Singh Thakur is trying to take political benefit of the situation.

Earlier last week, Madhya Pradesh assembly pro tem Speaker Rameshwar Sharma had claimed that building the Ram temple will get rid of the contagion.

However, officials of the party allege that the state government is taking action against them as it is “anti-Dalit” and is trying to suppress the voice of the community.

According to reports, a large number of Bhim Army members led by state president Mahak Singh had staged a dharna at tehsil premises in Laksar on July 22 to demand the arrest of an accused who had allegedly thrashed a Dalit man from Pitpura village of Laksar. “They (protester) did not take any permission to stage the protest and were disobeying the mandatory social distancing rule. We first commissioned an inquiry over their conduct and then registered a case against them,” said Rajan Singh, circle officer of Laksar.

Police have registered a case against them under section 144 (unlawful assembly) of the Indian Penal Code and 51-B of the Disaster Management Act.

Meanwhile, Mahak Singh has said that police are working on the commands of the BJP leaders. “The BJP is an anti-Dalit party and is not leaving any chance to harras our men,” he said.

They appeared in several batches in the test that continued till 8pm. The online test was scheduled from 12 noon to 2pm on Sunday and a total 25,000 candidates have registered for it.

However, just as test was about to begin, the website of city traffic police crashed and the candidates could not log in. Along with citizens, a number of police personnel were also seen making repeated attempts to log in, but in vain.

“We had planned for one lakh candidates and we were to distribute them in multiple slots during the day to avoid pressure on the server. But due to some communication gap, 18,000 candidates were instructed to log-in in the first batch. Due to the large number, the server crashed,” said Prashant Sumbe, deputy commissioner of police, traffic.

Police had planned to take the test in batches of 6,000 each. Along with the 18,000 who were sent instruction log in at same time, there were many others who tried to log in without prior registration. “Nearly one lakh hits were reported on the website,” Sumbe added.

MYSURU: The Covid-19 cluster outbreak at JK Tyre and Industries plant claimed its first fatality on Sunday, although there was some respite with no new fresh cases recorded for a third day in a row. The plant has over 6,000 employees and 204 have contracted the virus.

It’s the biggest single source of Covid-19 in the district following the outbreak at the pharmaceutical company in Nanjangud, which was reported in the early days of the pandemic in the state.

The management said the 54-year-old employee who died on Sunday had cardiac issues and comes within two days of another staffer committing suicide. A senior official of the company said the employee who had committed suicide had tested negative, but was in quarantine.

While the workforce is rattled with the situation, an employee union office- bearer said the company is providing good medical care and other support. ""For the past three days, there have been no new cases among employees or their contacts,"" said DK Lingaraju, joint director, District Industries Centre. Mysuru City Corporation officials visited the plant on Friday and reviewed the situation.

The first positive case was reported two weeks ago and the plant immediately shut for sanitisation. ""As more employees tested positive, we shut both plants 12 days ago,"" officials said. ""We plan to reopen on Thursday.""

District deputy commissioner Abhiram G Sankar said the company had shut its units on the advice of the district administration. ""It is not a forced closure,"" he insisted.

District health department officials said the company has joined hands with two private hospitals in the city to test and treat its employees. ""Those who have tested positive have been kept in isolation by the company so there is no pressure on the health department,"" officials said.

348,['27/07/2020'],DU admissions: Artistes to move VP for trials,"NEW DELHI: Delhi University has decided to retain the extra-curricular activity ( ECA ) quota after several artistes petitioned the Vice-President of India, M Venkaiah Naidu , who is also its chancellor, to intervene in the matter. However, several of them have now called it mere “tokenism” as the admissions under this quota will be carried out without any trial.

Bharatnatyam dancer Geeta Chandran, who had approached Naidu, told TOI, “Without trials, there is no meaning because you can buy certificates in this country.”

Pointing out that the whole education system is turning online during the Covid-19 pandemic, she added, “If you can evaluate and educate students, why cannot you conduct trials online? Certificates are a wrong way of assessing art as art is not something that is competitive. You have to see an artiste ’s involvement, passion.”

Chandran said, they had suggested DU two ways to hold ECA admissions. “One suggestion was to ask for CDs from candidates to shortlist them before holding trials for competent candidates. Another one was to have online trials. But DU said it was going without trials,” she said. They are planning to bring in more artistes and approach the Vice-President again.

Another dancer, Ragini Chandershekar, wrote on social media, “These certificates are such a sham and are available by the dozen, hold no value whatsoever. The trials should be the only way to seek admission on the basis of ECA and panels should have artistes.”

Samyukta Ninan, a teacher, pointed out, “In schools, 14-year-old kids are taking part in online competitions, seminars, workshops, and performing for the elderly. So why can’t DU get its act together?”

This figure, among others, was revealed in a detailed analysis of deaths carried out by Delhi government’s health department.Last month, Delhi was staring at 5.5 lakh cases by the end of July, but the positive count seemingly plateaued and hadn’t even reached 1.5 lakh yet.The analysis revealed that from 1,089 cases between June 1 and 12 to 605 between July 1 and 12, there was an overall decline of 44% in deaths. The figure at Delhi government hospitals was 58%, where the number of deaths came down from 361 to 154 during the same period. In comparison, deaths in private hospitals reduced by 25% and central government health facilities saw a 55% reduction.The percentage of total deaths vis-a-vis total admissions also varied between hospitals. While the percentage in central government’s RML Hospital dropped from 81% in June to 58% in July, at Safdarjung Hospital it was 40% in June and 31% in July. Among Delhi government hospitals, Lok Nayak saw a drop from 28% in June to 16% in early July. At Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, the death rate was 6% in early June and 7% in early July. Because of this, the hospital was asked to share its best practices.""Delhi flattens the death curve, Covid deaths down 44 per cent in June. Personally, this has been my most important mission from the beginning of the pandemic. We will not get complacent even now. This figure needs to come down to ZERO,"" said the Chief Minister in a tweet on Monday morning.Between June 1 and 12, 67% patients died within four days of admission, including 34% within 24 hours. In comparison, between July 1 and 12, 35% of patients died within four days of admission and 15% within 24 hours.To further reduce the death rate, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has directed the health department officials to focus on government hospitals with the highest death rates, or those having the highest proportion of deaths taking place in wards instead of ICUs, and recommend adoption of specific measures.Health minister Satyendar Jain said that this turnaround was possible due to the single-minded focus of the CM on initiatives that would directly help prevent deaths. “The CM has been personally monitoring the daily status of critical patients and deaths. His emphasis on timely implementation of crucial initiatives to prevent deaths has helped turn around the situation and restore public confidence in Delhi government’s hospitals,” he added.Some of the key initiatives of the ‘Delhi model’ were widespread testing, oximeters, responsive ambulance system, availability of beds and focus on adding ICU beds.From an average of 5,500 tests per day, testing was scaled up to 21,000 daily in early July with a rate of 50,000 per million, the highest in the country. Home isolation was a success story. It was made possible by distribution of oximeters for free to all such patients so that they could monitor their vitals and, in case they became serious, not lose any precious time in getting transferred to hospitals.To reduce deaths during the transfer to hospitals, Kejriwal ordered a rapid expansion of the ambulance fleet. Daily reports of the fleet and response time were monitored by him. The number of beds was also increased from around 3,700 in May-end to 15,000 in early July. Delhi Corona app was also launched. Also, from less than 500 ICU beds in early June, Delhi now has over 2,200, about 1,400 of which are vacant.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77188546,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-207765,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/with-44-dip-in-a-month-delhi-flattens-death-curve/articleshow/77187340.cms

Ashok Jirawala, president of FOGWA told TOI, “All weavers have been asked to provide bank details to the traders for online transfer of outstanding payments.

Ashish Gujarat, president of Pandesara Weavers Association told TOI, “All members of Pandesara GIDC have conveyed to the traders about making payment digitally through NEFT, IMPS etc.”

However, textile traders are opposing the new online payment system stating that majority of them still use the old payment mode of cheques to make or receive payments.

355,['27/07/2020'],Rapid antigen tests in Vid set to burden city med infra,"Nagpur: Almost all districts in Vidarbha will be conducting rapid antigen tests in large numbers in coming week starting from Monday. While it’s good move as it will increase number of tests significantly in rural Vidarbha, health facilities in Nagpur are set to face a major burden of referred patients in next two-three weeks.

In rapid antigen tests, elderly, ailing or those who have chronic illnesses, and those who have some symptoms of Covid-19 are tested on priority apart from those in close contacts of already positive patients. This is set to identify high number of Covid-19 patients as well as many others with serious non-Covid illnesses. It’s very common practice in Vidarbha to refer serious patients (both Covid and non-Covid) to Nagpur.

At present, 97 Covid-19 patients referred from other districts and neighbouring states are undergoing treatment in Nagpur’s GMCH and IGGMCH. Patients from neighbouring states like Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Telangana also get referred to Nagpur as the city has emerged as a medical hub over the years.

With more patients getting diagnosed through rapid antigen tests, more will be referred to Nagpur. This will obviously increase the burden on health infrastructure and workforce in Nagpur, which is already working under pressure.

“Covid or non-Covid, all serious patients are referred to Nagpur from across Vidarbha and MP. In case of Covid-19 patients, those having severe co-morbid conditions and moderate-to-serious level of infections are referred to city so that their co-morbidities could be treated,” said Dr Mohd Faizal, nodal officer of Covid Hospital at GMCH.

“Out of total 82 deaths in Nagpur, 20 are of those patients who were referred from other districts and states,” said Dr Sagar Pande, nodal officer of Covid Hospital in IGGMCH where 10 patients referred from other districts died during treatment, while 16 more are under treatment. Some of them are serious and in ICU. Both government hospitals in the city are bound to admit and treat Covid-19 patients irrespective of their place of residence. Moreover, being tertiary clinics, these hospitals are final treatment option to many critical non-Covid patients too.

Districts like Yavatmal, Buldhana, Washim, Amravati, Gondia, and Bhandara have decided to test elderly people having ailments like fever, pneumonia, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Yavatmal will be conducting 300 rapid tests daily. Buldhana is already conducting 200 rapid tests a day, Akola and Amravati even more.

Real task is ahead...

Covid as well as serious non-Covid patients are referred to Nagpur from all parts of Vidarbha and adjoining states

In next two-three weeks, a large number of rapid tests will be conducted in rural Vidarbha

As facilities are limited in rural areas, serious patients will be referred to Nagpur

Burden will increase on Nagpur’s health care facilities and already exhausted medical workforce

More ICU beds, ventilators must remain vacant to tackle projected surge in referred patients

For this, CCCs for mild asymptomatic patients, and home isolation for totally asymptomatic must begin

Officials in the collectorate said they were not even aware of meeting held by the NMC to start the CCCs at existing quarantine centres. Offices of divisional commissioner, civil surgeon and even deputy director of health services (DDHS) too were not part of the meeting convened by the NMC on Saturday.

Officials claimed that none from the district administration or the health department were taken into confidence and only in-charge at the four quarantine centres were called and informed about the CCC decision by the NMC.

Since the beginning of outbreak, civic administration and health officials have been jointly working in the fight against Covid. The administrative staff was provided by the district administration while logistics were taken care of by the civic body.

Asked about the problems at new CCCs, district collector Ravindra Thakare said those were entirely under the NMC. “Our officials have been working on arrangements at only two CCCs — Government Polytechnic and College of Engineering. Both the CCCs have not yet started,” he said.

Earlier, the NMC had requested the district administration to start new CCCs at the two institutions where the latter had started work in full steam. “If NMC had to start CCCs on its own, it should have conveyed to the district administration about its plans. It would have saved a lot of hassles,” said officials.

Meanwhile, health officials expressed surprise over NMC’s move to discharge over 1,000 suspects after first negative test despite the virus incubation period ranging from two to 12 days. In fact, those retained at the four new CCCs — VNIT hostels, Pachpaoli police quarters, Symbiosis and Vanamati — were found positive in the second test, they cited.

Asked how the administration would monitor those discharged soon after the first test, civil surgeon Dr Devendra Paturkar refused to comment.

Civic officials, however, said rapid antigen tests would be conducted at home if suspects show any symptoms.

358,['27/07/2020'],10 mosques and dargahs near Ramjanmabhoomi echo harmony and Ayodhya’s syncretic culture,"Tehribazar Jogiyon ki Masjid & Dorahi Kuan Mosque in Ayodhya

AYODHYA: The 70-acre Ramjanmabhoomi premises is hemmed in by eight mosques and two mausoleums, including one believed to have been built by Hindu hermits. These Muslim places of worship are located within 100-200m off the fortified area, where azaan and Ramayana chants seamless blend to cement the syncretic culture of Ayodhya.

Unlike the Babri masjid, where namaz stopped after December 23, 1949, five-time prayers are offered at these centuries-old Islamic structures adjacent to Ramjanmabhoomi, which also includes a Shia mosque and Imambara and the Tehribazar Jogiyon ki Masjid, which as the name suggests was built by Hindu salvation seekers (jogis) more than 200 years ago.

“Though these mosques are in close proximity to Ramjanmabhoomi, we never faced opposition from our Hindu brethren even at the peak of the temple movement and many of them visit our dargahs during the annual Urs.

Five-time azaan and qawwali during Urs go hand in hand with chant of Ramayana verses, displaying communal harmony and peaceful coexistence for centuries,” said Syed Akhlaq Ahmad Latifi, peer of the 500-year-old mausoleum, Khanqaahe Muzaffariya.

Talking to TOI, Haji Asad Ahmad, corporator of Ram Kot ward that straddles Ramjanmabhoomi, said, “It’s the greatness of Ayodhya that mosques surrounding the temple of Ram Lalla gives out a message of harmony to rest of the world. Our Barawafat procession winds its way around the periphery of Ramjanmabhoomi and our Hindu brothers also join in.”

The eight mosques around the 70-acre land mandated by Supreme Court for building the temple, include Masjid Dorahi Kuan, Masjid Maali Mandir ke Bagal, Masjid Kaziyana Achchan ke Bagal, Masjid Imambara, Masjid Riyaz ke Bagal, Masjid Badar Paanjitola, Masjid Madaar Shah, Masjid Tehribazar Jogiyon ki (built by Hindus).

There are two other dargahs — Khanqaahe Muzaffariya and Imambara.

Chief priest of Ramjanmabhoomi, Acharya Satyendra Das, said, “Only the mosque named after Babar was disputed. Other mosques and mausoleums symbolise harmony and peaceful coexistence. Muslims offer namaz and we offer our puja. Mosques adjacent to Ramjanmabhoomi will only strengthen the bond between the two communities. Both Hindu and Muslims in Ayodhya accepted the Supreme Court verdict and we have no dispute with each other.”

What better portrait can be drawn of Ayodhya than of a magnificent Ram Mandir surrounded by mosques with all offering prayers according to their belief, said Mahant Yugal Kishore Sharan Shastri, chief priest of Saryu Kunj temple adjacent to Ramjanmabhoomi. Ayodhya represents the true India, he added. Similar sentiments were echoed by Mahant Raju Das, chief priest of Hanumangarhi temple.

Talking to TOI, Triloki Nath Pandey, decree holder of Ramjanmabhoomi, said, “Ayodhya must live in peace and harmony. Only the Babri mosque was disputed, we have no issues with mosques surrounding the birthplace of Lord Ram.”

359,['27/07/2020'],Disposal of bio-med waste a problem? Doctors find cure,"The kits are being distributed through the malaria department staff of SDMC sanitising the houses of Covid-19 ... Read More

NEW DELHI: In a unique initiative, a group of four doctors has tied up with South Delhi Municipal Corporation for free distribution of kits among suspected or Covid-positive patients under home isolation so that biomedical waste could be collected and disposed of properly.

Each of the kits, bought from an authorised company, has 14 sanitised yellow bags for storing biomedical waste, zip ties, hypochlorite spray to be used before and after disposal, and a brochure specifying ways to handle such waste and other informative material.

While SDMC has shared details of people and collected the kits to give them, the doctors are also distributing it themselves. “We signed an MoU with SDMC on July 22 and gave them 200 kits. We have also distributed 150 kits in the past one month. We formed an NGO, Janasa, and helped suspected cases among policemen in Southeast district after taking permission from the DCP,” said Dr Ajit Gaba, founder of Janasa.

The idea to start the initiative came after the doctors received multiple queries from people about disposal of biomedical waste. Also, one of the doctors faced a similar challenge after she tested Covid-positive and couldn’t get any help from the authorities, forcing her to keep the waste at home for 14 days.

Dr Amodita Ahuja, one of the members, said, “While monitoring of patients is regularly done by government agencies, collection, disinfection and disposal of biomedical waste generated by them (body secretions, gloves, masks, etc) takes time. As a result, this hazardous waste is disposed of in regular garbage bags. This poses a threat to waste collectors who might get infected with the virus.”

Ahuja and her colleague, Dr Tanvi Gaba, who work with the same private hospital in Malviya Nagar, took the guidance of Dr Ajit Gaba, collected funds and bought kits from a company supplying them to healthcare facilities in the city. “We began with approaching our contacts in Dwarka, Rohini, Pitampura, Sheikh Sarai and Chirag Dilli and helped at least 150 people under home isolation,” said Tanvi, a resident of Sheikh Sarai-I.

SDMC south zone chairperson and councillor from Malviya Nagar Dr Nandini Sharma said that the doctors had approached her 15 days ago. “To begin with, we decided to take their assistance in south zone. The kits are being distributed through malaria department staff going for sanitising houses of Covid-19 patients. We are also making videos for circulation among the public,” she added.

“Though our concessionaire is collecting bio-med waste from such houses separately as per norms, they don’t have yellow bags all the time,” said Sharma.

Tanvi and Ahuja also got support from Dr Vimarsh Raina, a pathologist residing in Greater Kailash-II. The group is promoting the concept on social media and requesting people to contribute to the cause.

It is the only issue which needs to be discussed on topmost priority,” Goa Forward Party president and Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai said.He said it was meaningless to pass the full budget, as it should be reset due to Covid-19, and the government should take another vote on account. The budget was presented in February and the government had taken a vote on account for four months.“From the agenda we have received, the government doesn’t consider Covid situation as important to discuss in the assembly. Everyone knows that Covid crisis is a matter of urgent importance and has to be discussed in the House as so far 35 persons have lost their lives,” Sardesai said.Leader of the opposition Digambar Kamat said with 35 deaths, including that of a 14-year-old, the government’s top priority should have been discussion on Covid-19. “We have demanded it. All other matters, including passing the full budget, are secondary,” he said.Sardesai said Congress and GFP have coordinated and put up questions, on issues such as the financial situation, ‘labour gate’ scam, proposal to cut thousands of trees in the Mollem wildlife sanctuary, hardships faced by non-resident Goans and seafarers while returning to the state due to the Covid-19 situation and status of forests.On Monday, the government will answer a total of 187 questions. Besides, the government also aims to introduce and pass 11 bills that were earlier issued in the form of ordinances.Sources said the government will not introduce any major bill during the session.On June 22, it was announced that the monsoon session would be of three weeks which five days later was reduced to two weeks.

362,['27/07/2020'],Satyender Jain urges Centre to relax norms for sealed zones,"Satyender Jain

NEW DELHI: A serological survey conducted in the capital earlier this month revealed that nearly every fourth Delhiite has developed antibodies against the novel coronavirus. Delhi health minister Satyender Jain believes that the number might go up to 35-40% in the survey to be carried out next month and with Covid-19 now largely been contained in Delhi, the central government should relax its policy for containment zones .

At present, the capital has 714 containment zones.

Talking to the media on Saturday, Jain said that containment zones should now be de-contained after 15 days instead of 28 days currently. It is about time that the containment zone policy is reviewed, keeping in mind the different conditions in different areas, he added. He said that a review of the present policy is needed so that people don’t face unnecessary hassles.

While the spread of Covid-19 seems to have plateaued in Delhi, the number of cases in other parts of the country is on the rise. In Delhi, the number of containment zones has been rising because many of the zones have been re-demarcated into smaller zones for better management.

According to the present guidelines, a containment zone can only be de-contained if no resident of the zone is found Covid-19 positive for 28 days. At many locations in Delhi, such as Jahangirpuri and GTB Enclave, there are areas that have remained containment zones for three months at a stretch.

District officials say that people get restless after being restricted in the zone for a long time. “Though most of the people comply with the norms, some turn hostile. Many say their offices have reopened and they will lose their jobs if they are not allowed to get out of the zone,” a district official said.

“This is why many containment zones have been re-demarcated. Big areas have been divided into smaller blocks. This results in movement of fewer people getting restricted and also, fewer issues of people breaking rules,” he added.

Till now 365 security personnel have so far tested positive in the district, the highest number in the state. The only relief was that almost all of them, barring three local cops, were quarantined after reaching here from other districts and states.On July 5, 23 jawans of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) tested positive after reaching the district at the end of their leave. The number of positives has kept rising in CRPF, with it now standing at 88.The security personnel of State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) and CRPF were brought to the district as part of routine process of relieving deployed staff, and also to thwart Maoist violence during the forthcoming ‘Naxal saptah’ or martyrs’ week between July 28 and August 3. The forces have turned into a major headache after arriving in the district from different hotspots in the country. Around 274 SRPF jawans have tested positive so far in the district.District collector Deepak Singla said instructions have been issued to the police department to ensure jawans are tested before being brought to Gadchiroli, and also refrain from summoning fresh forces now as the existing ones are already reeling under Covid infection. “Several jawans have been discharged and more are on the way. We require jawans for anti-Naxal operations but they need to be tested first before being brought here,” said Singla.The collector said SRPF personnel staying in bunkers are in close contact with each other, leading to the spread of the infection. “We are unfortunately running out of space as Gadchiroli’s medical infrastructure does not have adequate manpower, and also there is dearth of private hospitals which can be converted into Covid centres,” he said.District civil surgeon Dr Anil Rudey said Gadchiroli has maintained negligible death rate, with only one dying in Hyderabad. He said the district was also following three layers of Covid fighting infrastructure with 13 Covid Care Centres in different blocks of the tribal district, Dedicated Covid Health Centres at Armori, Kurkheda, Aheri and Gadchiroli, along with two 200-bedded Dedicated Covid Hospitals.“We are not worried about the numbers but will fight to keep the death rate low and also stop community spread.

In a representation by SGCCI’s gems and jewellery committee to the SMC, it is stated that the diamond merchants are unable to do business due to less number of working hours permitted under the standard operating procedures (SOP) issued by SMC.

Kirti Shah, chairman of SGCCI’s gems and jewellery committee told TOI, “About 80% of the diamond trade is operated from the Mahidhapura diamond market. Post lockdown, the merchants are facing severe liquidity crisis due to the huge amount of outstanding payments to be realised from the merchants and traders in Mumbai. The four hours of working time from 2pm to 6pm is not enough.”

“We have demanded that the market should be allowed to operate from 12pm to 6pm to facilitate the traders in receiving their outstanding payments at their offices,” he added.

A diamond merchant in Mahidharpura , Manhar Sutaria told TOI, “It takes about one hour to get the valuables from the safe deposit vault in the morning and again to deposit the stock in the vaults in the evening. However, we are left with only three hours for business. The merchants are unable to sort the polished and rough diamonds due to the limited time.”

On Saturday night, inspector Karnail Singh reprimanded SI Dasrath Singh in the presence of the other troopers due to which he was upset.

A probe revealed that after shooting Karnail with his rifle, Dasrath panicked and tried to flee from the premises. However, on finding other cops near the gate, he shot himself with his service weapon. Police have recorded the statement of Dasrath’s colleagues to establish the sequence of events.

A CRPF staffer said that Dasrath was allotted a sharing room with Karnail at the Lodhi Estate quarters. He had allegedly returned to his room in an inebriated state and started having dinner with Karnail. While he ate some of the food, he started throwing away the rest of it. Seeing this, Karnail reprimanded him for wasting and scattering food outside the room. He threatened disciplinary actions against Dasrath.

A few minutes later, Dasrath returned with his AK-rifle and opened fire at Karnail. Hearing the gunshots, the other officers started looking for the shooter. A panicked Dasrath then shot himself with the same rifle in the guard room.

When the CRPF men reached the room where Karnail was shot, they found the tiffin box with the food scattered. Cops are waiting for the autopsy report of Dasrath and Karnail for more details.

Overall, Vidarbha’s recovery rate is higher than the state and national average so far. In district headquarters having municipal corporations, Akola has the best recovery rate in the state.

Recovery rate figures released on July 25 show that Mumbai and Sindhudurg (Konkan region), Dhule and Jalgaon (Khandesh region), and Hingoli (Marathwada) are the other in five top-ten districts. Also, Gadchiroli, Yavatmal and Washim districts in Vidarbha are in top 15, which confirms that the overall recovery rate of Vidarbha is better.

Gondia, with 91%, leads the state in recovery rate. In municipal corporations, Akola leads Maharashtra with 75.40% recovery. TOI has reported on July 25 that Akola, despite having high number of cases and Covid-19 deaths, has been quite successful in controlling the spread of infection.

Akola district collector Jitendra Papalkar said that effective containment zones and aggressive testing was the reason behind these positive results. “Akola has conducted 18,166 tests till date. We are also conducting massive rapid antigen tests,” he said. Akola has 2,412 cases, and 1,980 of them have recovered till date.

“Statistical research has proved that Covid-19 spread is under control in Akola. Especially, in municipal corporation area, we have done very effective containment. This experience will help us bring similar control in rural parts too,” said Papalkar, adding that the focus is now on controlling spread in rural parts of district.

According to him, more rapid antigen tests will be conducted in rural area. “Our team of SDOs and tehsildars had a meeting today in which we decided to get ready to control Covid-19 in rural areas now. All above 60 years of age will be checked and swab samples of those with low oxygen levels will be collected immediately,” he said.

In Gondia, which is leading Maharashtra in recovery rate at more than 90%, the key of success is institutional quarantine of returnees. Gondia has only 245 cases, and most of them are returnees who tested positive during their institutional quarantine period. Total 221 from Gondia have recovered and 3 patients died.

Gondia was one of the districts in Maharashtra that remained in Covid-19 green zone for a long time. During this period, they got time to prepare. Till today, 8,179 swab tests have been conducted here by RT-PCR method while 1,211 samples have been tested through rapid antigen method. District collector Kadambari Balkawade has appealed to the people to come forward and test themselves in case they develop any symptoms.

369,['27/07/2020'],Follow norms to avoid lockdown: Mundhe,"Nagpur: The second day of janata curfew called by the civic administration was a complete success with most shops barring a few groceries and pharmacies remaining closed. There was little traffic on the roads. Mayor Sandip Joshi and municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe thanked Nagpurians for their cooperation.

The major markets of the city — Sadar, Sitabuldi, Dharampeth, Central Avenue, Itwari etc — wore a deserted look on Sunday. Shops in residential areas also remained closed. Government as well as private offices were closed it being a Sunday.

Mundhe in a press communiqué said that people should show the same sense of responsibility in the coming days. They should wear masks, maintain social distancing and follow other norms. This would obviate the need for imposing a prolonged lockdown, the press release stated.

Joshi said that Nagpur had passed the litmus test of janata curfew. “In the coming four days all public representatives, right from MPs to corporators, would move around the city urging people to follow government norms. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) should not be forced to impose a lockdown,” he said.

Ashwin Mehadia, president of Nag Vidarbha Chamber of Commerce (NVCC), said that traders had done their bit and now Mundhe should comply with their request of allowing markets to function on weekdays with complete lockdown on Saturday and Sunday.

Other shopkeepers also want Mundhe not to impose a lockdown. “I kept my shop closed for two days on commissioner’s appeal. Now he must think about my bread and butter. Lockdown should not be imposed, else everybody will face financial troubles. Everybody has suffered a lot due to the lockdown in summer,” said mobile store owner Karan Grover.

Many grocery stores, which were open during lockdown, had downed their shutters during the janata curfew. Rajesh Shahu, owner of a grocery store, said that he had kept his establishment closed as a responsible citizen. “I wanted NMC to realize that we can act responsibly. Now, it should not impose a lockdown,” he told TOI.

Domestic helps did not turn up for work in most homes. Family members had to share housework in their absence. Kirti Patel, a doctor, said that she had to go to her hospital despite the curfew. “I had to do housework as well as my official work. Of course, my husband and kids shared household tasks but still lack of domestics is a big problem. Some concessions should be made for women who work in essential services,” she said.

The government had given the contract to supply solar pumps to two companies, based in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh respectively. For maintaining complete transparency, an online registration system for willing farmers had been invoked, he said.

The solar pumps would be distributed on a ‘first come, first served’ basis. Farmers have to pay the price of pumps via a demand draft, drawn in favour of the supplier after deducting the applicable amount of subsidy, Singh said.

“The solar pumping units will protect farmers from the hurdle of power supply failure and also help reduce pollution — noise in case of electrically-operated pumping units, air in case of diesel pumping sets. The solar pumps will have zero operational costs,” Singh added.

371,['27/07/2020'],"AAP, BJP spar over SDMC tax proposals","Representative image

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) on Sunday slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party-led South Delhi Municipal Corporation ( SDMC ) for trying to hike four taxes at the time of the Covid-19 pandemic and demanded a rollback.

The standing committee and the commissioner of SDMC have already cleared the proposals and a final decision is to be taken by its House on Monday.

AAP Delhi convener Gopal Rai said BJP should release a white paper clarifying where it has spent its funds. Calling the measures unfortunate, Rai, who is also a minister in Delhi government, said people were suffering from a massive economic crisis and the proposals betrayed Delhiites.

“The businesses have not yet fully started. Amid all these problems that have already made the lives of people miserable, SDMC is ready to impose this tax hike on the citizens of Delhi,” Rai said.

Increasing the professional tax means that doctors, engineers, chartered accountants and many others will have to pay more, while SDMC also wants to hike tax in unauthorised colonies, the minister said. “BJP is increasing the property transfer tax, too, that will hurt the middle class. Lastly, they have decided to increase the electricity tax,” he pointed out.

Delhi BJP chief Adesh Kumar Gupta tweeted saying he had requested the mayor for a rollback. He also urged chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to provide funds to the municipal corporations according to the recommendations of the Fourth Delhi Finance Commission.

Mayor Anamika Mithlesh said Gupta had spoken to her but Delhi government should also understand its responsibility. “They are not giving us funds, so how will we run the corporation? We require funds and that’s why we are looking for sources to generate revenues,” Mithilesh said.

However, Rai said, “Every time BJP says Delhi government has not paid the required amount to the municipal corporations, but it is a complete lie.” The Congress government in 2013-14 gave Rs 3,345 crore but under the AAP government from 2017-18, the corporations are annually getting Rs 4,667 crore, he claimed.

The CAG report has also said they had got Rs 3,815 crore extra loan, but “BJP has used all this money for their corruption”, Rai alleged.

AAP’s political affairs committee member Durgesh Pathak said AAP would go door to door to protest if the proposals weren’t rolled back.

First, it took away his job in the textile market, pushing Kapil Singh’s already hand-to-mouth existence to abject penury, and if that wasn’t enough, the virus then infected him too. However, it could not wreck the warrior’s spirit.The 56-year-old recovered and amid his struggle for survival, left the doctors at SMIMER hospital overwhelmed by donating plasma for other patients. Such benignity from the tribe of grateful survivors of his kind is what is keeping the plasma therapy hopes alive in the city battered by Covid-19.“He did not even have the money to pay for a rickshaw ride. We paid the fare,” said Dr Ankita Shah, head of immunohematology and blood transfusion (IHBT) department at SMIMER.Singh is one among the tribe of his battered ilk, penniless and jobless in Surat but have become icons for humanity through their plasma donation. Doctors said they have received plasma from migrant workers, daily wagers, security guards, ambulance drivers, among many others earning paltry salaries but rich in gratitude.“I was working as a labourer in a textile market, but lost my job. I am fortunate to have recovered from Covid, so I thought the least I could do is to donate plasma for others,” Singh told TOI.There was another such lump-in-the-throat moment for doctors in the New Civil Hospital, when a 52-year-old power-loom worker from Odisha, Bipin Mahapatra, too walked in to donate his plasma.“We have observed that many refrain from donating plasma as their family members discourage them out of fear. In Bipin’s case, his wife not only encouraged him but also accompanied him when he wanted to donate plasma. She was also infected and wanted to donate, but she is a mother of a young child and as per the guidelines, we can’t take her plasma,” Dr Mayur Jagar, in-charge of blood bank at NCH, told TOI.Surat’s two main hospitals have received plasma from 155 people — 85 at SMIMER and 70 at NCH — till date. SMC officials said that 162 people have been administered plasma therapy and results in 80% of the cases have been encouraging with the majority of them being saved from ventilator support.Another donor, Ritesh Rana (45), a security guard at Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC), said, “With the help of doctors, I recovered from Covid-19 and now I should help others by donating plasma. I will donate the second time too as I got to know that this therapy helps patients recover.”“There is a huge demand for plasma among doctors treating Covid-19 patients as the results are good.

The cell will be established in the Agra Development Authority office. Meanwhile, the Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC) is going to start soil testing for the construction of the first phase of the metro rail in Agra in the first week of August.

District magistrate (DM) Prabhu N Singh said, “To complete the Agra metro rail development project in a time-bound manner, an administrative cell will be established. The ADA board has approved a proposal for this. The cell’s main objective would be to address all hurdles that come up while implementing the project”.

The Agra metro rail project is estimated to cost Rs 8,379.6 crore. A total of 27 stations are planned to be developed along 29.4 km of the rail corridor in the city.

According to the detailed project report (DRP) approved by the Union Cabinet, the Agra Metro Rail Project will have two corridors which will pass through the heart of the city and will connect prominent tourist places, including the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Sikandra as well as ISBT, Raja Ki Mandi railway station, medical college, Agra Cantt railway station, Collectorate, Sanjay Place and densely populated residential areas.

375,['27/07/2020'],Foresters assaulted for stopping grazing in sanctuary,"Forest staffers were seriously injured by the shepherds’ attack

Nagpur: A forest guard and a van major were brutally assaulted, one of them seriously, by two shepherds for stopping them from illicit grazing in Dnyanganga wildlife sanctuary.

The incident occurred around 2pm on Saturday in Botha reserve forest compartment 261 when the shepherds with around 60 sheep sneaked into the protected area where grazing is banned.

There was a spat between forest staff and shepherds. Fearing seizure of animals by patrolling duty guard Ravindra More and Deepak Kandelkar, the shepherds attacked both with sticks and a blade knife (gupti) leaving them bleeding. The duo also snatched Rs4,520 before fleeing.

One of the accused has been identified as Swapnil Hatkar.

The injured foresters reached Hiwarkhed police station at 6pm, but API Pravin Tali allegedly did not register their complaint or even record the matter in the station diary.

“It was only after deputy conservator Manoj Kumar Khairnar talked to additional SP Sandip Pakhale that offences were registered at 2am on Sunday against the accused. No arrests have been made yet,” said sources.

Both the injured staffers are undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Buldhana.

According to Khairnar, sheep devouring forest areas is a serious problem in Buldhana. In 2018-2019, the state government, under political pressure, had allowed grazing on territorial forest land on an experimental basis. However, as it turned out to be a futile exercise, government did not extend the permission. Yet, shepherds bring their sheep for grazing illegally. There are more than 1 lakh sheep in Buldhana district alone.

SP Dilip Patil-Bhujbal said, “We will certainly take action against the accused as per law. But if the shepherds are committing crime by grazing sheep in forest, why the department doesn’t book them under forest laws?”

While the territorial officials are mute spectators, the accused have also been booked under Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. The police have slapped Section 307 (attempt to murder) along with other sections against the two accused.

AYODHYA: Despite the three decades-old legal battle between Hindu and Muslim plaintiffs over the Ayodhya title suit, the construction of Ram temple has blurred communal lines and triggered celebrations even among Muslim devotees of Lord Ram. While Faiz Khan is carrying bricks for the temple from his native village in Chhattisgarh, there many Muslim Ram bhakts who will throng the temple town to witness the historic moment when Prime Minister Narendra Modi lays the foundation stone on August 5.

TOI spoke to at least five Muslim devotees, Raja Raees, Wasi Haider, Haji Saeed, Jamshed Khan and Azam Khan, who consider Ram as ‘Imam-e-Hind’ and the forefather of many Rajputs, who later embraced Islam.

Backing the temple construction, president of Muslim Karsewak Sangh, Mohammad Azam Khan, said, “Lord Ram hailed from the community of warriors. I am a Pathan and our ancestors were Kshatriyas and I can claim Ram was my ancestor. Now, Muslims too want to show their support for the temple to spread love and end hatred.”Rashid Ansari, a resident of Faizabad, said, “It will be a blessing, if we get a chance to enter the sanctum sanctorum where the foundation will be laid by the prime minister.

Responding to mediapersons’ queries regarding the Char Dham Yatra, Rawat had on Saturday said that those protesting against the yatra are “not priests but Congress members and he could recognise them from their faces.”

Priests of the Gangotri and Yamunotri shrines said that the CM’s statement was “offensive and totally incorrect.”

Deepak Semwal, general secretary of Gangotri temple committee, said, “We oppose the remark made by CM Rawat . He should either withdraw his statement or be ready to face protests.” He added that the priests were gearing up to continue their protest against restarting the yatra until the situation is back to normal. “We have decided not to conduct any special prayers for pilgrims or provide them the necessary facilities like food and lodging.”

Echoing similar sentiments, president of Yamunotri Panch Panda Samiti, Ved Prakash Uniyal, said, “We are already fighting against the Devasthanam Board to save the age-old traditions of the Himalayan shrines and the ancestral rights of the priest community. Instead of trying to understand the concerns of the priests, the CM is now accusing them of being Congressmen. This is unfortunate and regrettable.”

Meanwhile, BJP state president Bansidhar Bhagat came out in support of the state government’s decision to open up the yatra for people from outside the state. “The government has tested waters with people from within the state for 25 days to see whether the yatra can go on smoothly. As the situation remained under control, we have opened it for others too. What is wrong in that?” he said.

Abhiyan’s allegations come after the front criticised Goa Foundation for writing to the Prime Minister over the government’s failure to recover Rs 3,431 crore from former mining leaseholders and over the chief minister’s collusion with the mining lobby to ensure defeat of e-auction of leases in the state.

The front alleged Goa Foundation was trying to derail resumption of mining and demanded that the government conduct an inquiry into the NGO’s source of funding. Defending Claude Alvares of Goa Foundation, GBA stated that Alvares exposed the extent of fraud and illegal mining in Goa, the facts on which the Supreme Court acted upon and stopped, pending clean-up of the systems.

“Such massive fraud and illegalities are a crime against the people of Goa and the state as well as the Union of India. With such a background, we are aghast that the state government can sit back and allow such public instigation of violence to continue against a person who has dutifully upheld the law,” stated GBA convener Sabina Martins.

Attacks on Alvares in this case amount to attack on the laws of India and Supreme Court and should not be tolerated, secretary Reboni Saha stated, adding that the front could have benefitted from the recovery of thousands of crores from large scale illegal mining loot yet to be recovered by the government.

“Best practices through auctions and methods of equitable distribution of resources have been repeatedly highlighted as balanced ways forward and yet it is being rejected outright by a select few mining interests in fear of finally being brought under legal scrutiny,” she added.

GBA has called for the government to stop all diversionary tactics and uphold the Supreme Court orders, ensure law and order prevails and work urgently for a sustainable way forward.

SURAT: While comet NEOWISE is keeping earthlings busy with its rare appearance, two Surat Class X girls made their own trailblazing once-in-a-lifetime discovery recently.

Two 14-year-olds from PP Savani Chaitanya Vidhya Sankul – Vaidehi Vekariya and Radhika Lakhani – discovered an asteroid, now christened as HLV2514 by Nasa upon confirmation. It also holds the potential of crossing the earth some day.

According to the training institute, SPACE, where the duo trains for astronomical studies, Nasa has sent a confirmation mail about the two Class X girls’ rare discovery. The students spotted the asteroid during the study as part of the All India Asteroid Search Campaign (AIASC) of IASC, an outreach programme of Nasa for space research.

In an email to the institute, the IASC director, Dr Patrick Miller, stated, “In the last campaign, your team reported HLV2514 as a new asteroid. It is, in fact, a near-Earth object (NEO). This NEO is near the planet Mars, and over time (~10^6 years) will evolve into an Earth-crossing asteroid. Mars-crossing asteroids are called Amors. Earth-crossing asteroids are called Apollos. Congratulations!!""

Receiving the adulation of Miller, a professor of mathematics at Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene in Texas, the girls are overjoyed not only with their discovery but at being recognized too. “We had tagged around 20 objects of which this one proved lucky. We have given it a random name at present and we may get an opportunity to name the asteroid once its orbit is confirmed by Nasa. It may, however, take a few years’ time,” duo told TOI.

Vaidehi's father is in the textile business, while Radhika's father is in the business of computer peripherals. Vaidehi's family hails from Bhavnagar while Radhika's family is from Amreli district.

It all began by examining multiple images by Pan-STARRS Telescope in Hawaii on a software and identified the moving object that the duo spotted moving near Mars, which incidentally till now was hidden. IASC facilitates students with images and software to study, and the participants identify these objects and tag them with numbers. They then submit the details and after verification IASC confirms a rare discovery.

""It is the first time in Gujarat and after four years in the country that an asteroid has been discovered,"" claimed Akash Dwivedi, educator at SPACE.

From participation in the programme to learning — the entire study process was from home amid the pandemic conditions.

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is likely to announce a series of initiatives next week for the economic revival of Delhi. With Delhi government succeeding in containing the spread of Covid-19, the focus is now on bringing the economy back on track and getting people their livelihoods, sources said.

The initiative will include the launch of a job portal and focus on resumption of all business activities in Delhi, including malls and hotels, sources added.

The chief minister has received several suggestions from economists and representatives from trade and industry for Delhi’s economic revival. Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi, which has recently formed a committee to suggest measures for economic recovery in Delhi, has also received representations. Sources said several industry associations, such as CII, Automotive Parts Merchant Association, Delhi Textile Merchants Association, National Restaurants Association of India and Handicrafts Exporters Association among others, have given their suggestions on measures Delhi government should take to revive the economy.

Delhi government, sources said, is preparing a detailed action plan based on the suggestions of all these experts and industry representatives.

One of these initiatives is the job portal that will help both employers and those seeking jobs. With a large number of migrant labourers returning, Delhi government’s job portal will help them connect with employers who are unlocking and need staff.

Delhi labour and employment minister Gopal Rai said Kejriwal will launch the job portal in the next few days. He added that those seeking jobs will be able to post their details and requirements in accordance with their qualification on the portal. They will not have to apply for jobs at several places.

Earlier this month, Delhi government had formed a 12-member expert committee to explore economic reform measures in order to help businesses recover from the impact of Covid-19 and the panel is carrying out a comprehensive analysis.

The relief measures being planned by Delhi government for existing businesses and entrepreneurs who want to take up new economic activities may include allowing renewal or automatic extension of licences issued by various departments that expired in March 2020 till March 2021 without penalty, except for categories like excise, pollution control, fire safety, etc. Moratorium with respect to lease payments is likely to be given in some areas. The government may also waive off some fines and penalties to remove undue financial hardships on firms.

The city corporation has close to 50 lab technicians, including the ones with the 32 primary health centres and 10 mobile medical units. “To ensure that all the fever camps have a lab technician, we are recruiting another 50 lab technicians for a monthly salary of Rs15,000. We have already started the recruitment drive and interested candidates could approach us. All the technicians at the primary health centres would be shifted to the fever camps once the recruitment process is over,” Sravan Kumar said.

Pointing out that the fever camps and door-to-door survey were effective in identifying new positive cases, he said more than half of the recent Covid-19 cases in the city corporation limits was identified through them. “We are also distributing immunity booster packs comprising multivitamin and zinc tablets and kabasura kudineer to the people. Fumigation drive is also carried out across the city.”

The source, meanwhile, said 70% to 80% of the positive cases were asymptomatic. “The fever camps are useful to identify symptomatic cases. Primary and secondary contacts of infected people are identified through surveys.”

The city corporation has been conducting fever camps for the past three weeks and has already covered more than half of the areas. The remaining localities, the source said, would be covered in a week. “Right from sending people with symptoms to primary health centre to taking tests to obtaining results and sending them to the ESI Hospital or Covid care centre for treatment, the entire responsibility is on the shoulders of health workers at the camps.”

The corporation had sealed entrances to the street on July 9 after four residents turned positive for Covid-19, said Jothi, a resident. “Though the patients were discharged and returned a week ago, the street has not been reopened. Officials said they will reopen only on Friday,” she told TOI.

As Edayar Street is part of Sullivan Street, it was divided into two parts and the corporation sealed the two parts separately, said Tirupathi, a resident. “No one tested positive on the stretch close to Gandhi Park in the last 10 days. The corporation should consider reopening at least a portion,” he said.

The residents have been buying essential commodities from grocery shops on the street. “As both ends of our street are closed and no two-wheelers can pass, we are forced to walk through Edayar Street to buy essentials that are not available in the shops,” Jothi said. “My children’s school wants us to pay 40% of the fee by cheque. Until the street is opened, I cannot go to my bank at RS Puram for the purpose.”

Meanwhile, corporation officials said that they will open containment zones 14 days after the last positive case is reported.

However, there are also days — July 16 for instance —where the number of positives and negatives add up to more than the total tests, which officials are unable to explain.Cumulatively, in the two months in question, there are 22,842 tests which were neither negative nor positive. A total of 7.9 lakh tests were conducted during the two-month period, of which 7.2 lakh returned negative.While the data pertains to a specific period — May 15 to July 16 when the state stopped releasing data on the number of samples testing negative — there could be more such cases in the weeks preceding May 15 and the days after July 16.Multiple calls to medical education minister K Sudhakar, health minister B Sriramulu, principal secretary (health) Jawaid Akthar and health commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pandey went unanswered.Health director Omprakash Patil, said: “We will have to check why the numbers are so high if these are inconclusive tests. Another reason could be because some samples tested were of those people who were already positive. We will get back with more details.”Dr CN Manjunath, nodal officer testing, also said he would have to check why there were so many cases that don’t add up, while IAS officer Shalini Rajneesh, who is also overseeing testing operations in the state, did not comment immediately, stating that she took charge only recently.Dr Shanmugappa from RGUHS, who is coordinating with testing labs in the state, said: “Apart from positives and negatives, some tests are indeterminate/inconclusive which could be the reason for the number of positives and negatives not adding up to the total tests done.”On how on some days the number of positives and negatives together add up to more than the total tests done on the day, Dr Shanmugappa said: “You need to check that with the national health mission.”Arundathi Chandrashekar, mission director, National Health Mission, said positive results being fewer than the difference between total tests and negative results could be because of inconclusive tests and duplication in tests data, but admitted the number of positives being more than the difference was puzzling. “We will have to check on that specifically before responding. There is no explanation for the number of positives being more,” she said.One member on the government’s task force, without wanting to be named, said that even the task force has not been able to get a correct response to this mismatch. All the officials TOI spoke with unanimously agreed that in case of an inconclusive test result, the procedure was to collect the sample from the subject afresh and redo the test.However, the state does not have data on how many such tests have been conducted so far. While Patil, and Shanmugappa said there is no such data, Arundathi said: “That data may be available at the district level, it is not maintained by us.”",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77190093,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-543001,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/results-on-over-22-8k-samples-tested-are-inconclusive/articleshow/77186898.cms

Their parents said there was no money. Staring at a dead end, Rajendra Singh Dhami, 30, former captain of the Indian wheelchair cricket team and current captain of the Uttarakhand side, has now been forced to work as a labourer to support his family.

Dhami, who is 90% disabled after he was stuck with paralysis as a 3-year-old, has won numerous awards for his performance on the cricketing field. He also has a masters degree in History as well as a BEd. But despite his qualifications and performance as a sportsperson who has represented the country and continues to play for the state, he was left without a source of income during the Covid-19-induced lockdown .

“Before this, I was giving coaching to wheelchair-bound children interested in playing cricket in Rudrapur. But that came to a halt. I returned to my village Raikot in Pithoragarh, where my parents live,” Dhami told TOI. He added that a few months into the lockdown, it became very difficult to make ends meet. “My parents are old. I have a sister and younger brother as well. My brother used to work at a hotel in Gujarat but he, too, lost his job during the lockdown. Therefore, I decided to take up work in my village under the MGNREGA scheme,” said the cricketer who has toured several countries like Malaysia, Bangladesh and Nepal while leading the Uttarakhand wheelchair cricket team.

Asked if he approached anybody for help, Dhami, who led the Indian side in the India-Nepal-Bangladesh triangular wheelchair cricket series in 2017, said, “ Some people have come forward to help like actor Sonu Sood who sent me Rs 11,000. There are people in Rudrapur and Pithoragarh also who have helped me a bit.” But it hasn’t been enough for the family.

“There is no problem in doing any kind of job to earn a living. I took up the MGNREGA job because it enables me to work near my home. These are difficult times but I know I will be able to overcome them,” he said with a smile that appeared to reach his eyes.

390,['27/07/2020'],Songs of son of the soil,"By R Rangaraj

Chennai: On the banks of the Kollidam river, an old lady would sing folk songs to her grandchildren. One of them was so influenced by these songs that he wanted to write poems. The passion led to A Maruthakasi, born in a farmers home to go on to write songs that cine icons like MGR, Sivaji Ganesan, Savithri and Bhanumathi hummed and danced to.

The centenary year of the man who went on to write more than 4,000 songs for Tamil films is hardly being remembered by the industry to which he gave 25 years.

Born on February 13, 1920 at Melakudikadu in Trichy district, Maruthakasi studied only upto intermediate level at Government College in Kumbakonam as he had to return to agriculture to help his family. Yet, from a young age his love for Tamil literature and his flair for writing poetry made him want to chart a different path.

Rajagopala Aiyer, brother of famous Tamil film lyricist and music composer Papanasam Sivan, had a great impact on the life of Maruthakasi. The young Maruthakasi used to write songs for plays which impressed Aiyer and noted singer Trichy Loganathan who recommended Maruthakasi to T R Sundaram of Modern Theatres in Salem to write for films. Maruthakasi got to write his first song ""Penn Enum Maaya Peyaam"" in 1949 for the film for ‘Mayavathi. His songs for ‘Ponmudi’ in 1950 and ""Vaaraay Nee Vaaraay"", ""Ulavarum Thenral"" sung by Trichy Loganathan for ‘Mandhirikumari’ became big hits and Maruthakasi became a much sought after lyricist. It was also the beginning of his successful working partnership with Ka Mu Sheriff.

Maruthakasi soon acquired a reputation for writing lyrics in accordance with the tune. This particularly came in handy while writing songs for films dubbed or remade from other languages, especially Hindi, a trend at the time. His son Maruthabarani, who seems to have imbibed his father’s talent of writing Tamil songs for tunes of other languages, said that when a line in a song in Tamil had to be fitted for the Malayalam words ""Malayalam Ende Malayalam"", Maruthakasi came up with the line ""Malaiyaagumae Thiru Malaiyaagumae"", to go with the lip-sync and the production unit greeted the line with all-round cheer.

Many times, filmmakers, despite working with other lyricists, would turn to Maruthakasi when it came to remakes. For instance, one of his evergreen songs ""Neela Vanna Kannaa Vaadaa"" in ‘Mangaiyar Thilakam’ (1955), re-make of a Marathi film, was initially assigned to Kannadasan. But when filmmaker L V Prasad wasn’t impressed by the song, he approached Maruthakasi and the rest is history. His magic with words was also felt in ‘Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum’ (1956), another film that was based on the tunes of a Hindi film. The lyricist Udumalai Narayana Kavi wanted only fresh songs as he had a distaste for the black, round-shaped Hindi LP records, calling them ‘karuppu dosai kal’, and recommended Maruthakasi who delivered with chartbusters like ""Azhagaana Ponnu Naan Adhukaetha Kannudhaan"" and ""Ullasa Ulagam Unakke Sondham"". Soon he began writing songs for all the leading music directors such as S V Venkataraman, G Ramanathan, K V Mahadevan, S Dakshinamurthy and the duo Viswanathan-Ramamoorthy.

He was among the first to change Tamil film lyrics from a Sanskrit-dominated, mythology-oriented period to a format that was closer to the Tamil people, incorporating contemporary ideas, while at the same time stressing on the cultural roots, especially with relation to traditional crafts and agriculture. Many of his songs were rooted to the Tamil Nadu soil, bearing a stamp of nativity. Of course, he did his share of mythology-based films ‘Sampoorna Ramayanam’ (1958) starring N T Rama Rao, Sivaji Ganesan, Padmini and T K Bhagavathy, and Lava Kusa which became popular among the masses. But he preferred social films.

The humane qualities of Maruthakasi came to the fore on several occasions. He gave opportunities to Pattukkotai Kalyanasundaram early in his career. He was one of those who recommended T M Sounderarajan for ‘Thookku Thookki’, though initially actor Sivaji Ganesan wanted only C S Jayaraman to sing for him. After the film TMS became a regular fixture for Sivaji. Maruthakasi also played a vital role in the career of Vali, whose song ""Sirikkinraal Inru Sirikkinraal"" for ‘Nallavan Vaazhvaan’ was not accepted by the film crew, who and invited Maruthakasi to write the song instead. Maruthakasi insisted on retaining Vali’s song which helped his association with C N Annadurai and MGR (hero).

Like a few other illustrious colleagues in the film industry he tried his hand at film production. The film ‘Alli Petra Pillai; re-make of a successful Hindi movie ‘Tangewali’ was lost without a trace. When his co-producer K V Mahadevan rued the fact that they were debt ridden, Maruthakasi shrugged and said, ""Aanaakka Andha Madam, Aagaatti Sandhe Madam"". He converted his pain into art and used these lines as pallavi for the film ‘Aayiram Roobaay’, which said that they can either reach the skies or descend to the level of a platform.

Meanwhile, Kannadasan had risen to dizzying heights, and Maruthakasi, already facing a huge debt burden, found his opportunities shrinking. He decided to quit and moved back to his village, cutting off all ties from 1963 to 1967. In 1967, after MGR, who was his close friend, recovered from the shooting incident involving M R Radha, and decided to resume work and sent word for Maruthakasi to return and write for his films. Maruthakasi returned, recorded a song but the film was suddenly shelved. MGR continued to support him. It was Maruthakasi's rustic songs like ""Kadavul Enum Mudhalali Kandedutha Thozhilaali Vivasaayi"", for ‘Vivasaayi’, which added to MGR’s pro-farmer, image. Devar backed Maruthakasi’s second innings with Thaerthiruvizha, and other films. In the later years, he wrote lyrics for a few films starring Jaishankar, Rajinikanth and Sivakumar. He was conferred the title Thiraikkavi Thilakam. His works were nationalised by the Government of Tamil Nadu.

A man, deeply moved by the Cauvery, agriculture and the traditions of the working class in Tamil Nadu, wedded to self-respect, he will always remain the true son of the soil through his words.

At the same time, several suspects who tested positive were retained at these four newly-converted CCCs while over 1,000 suspects who tested negative time were sent for 14-day home isolation. Forty-nine positive patients are now at Pachpaoli, and 15 at Vanamati. An unspecified number of patients are now at Symbiosis.

VNIT admitted 148 asymptomatic patients from GMCH and IGGMCH till Sunday evening. At the same time, it also admitted another 40 suspects on Saturday as they had already reached the centre. On the other hand, centre incharge also handled the release of 502 suspects.

As per VNIT, Pachpaoli and Vanamati officials, the retained patients tested positive in the second tests. As district is following 10 day discharge policy, the now positive persons have already spent 6 days in quarantine and now CCC because of long wait list at government hospitals.

On Saturday, the civic body decided to convert these quarantine centres into CCCs and all suspects who tested negative were released in a jiffy. The sudden decision took by surprised the doctors and paramedics, who remained stuck at these new CCCs until late in the night.

At Pachpaoli police quarters, NMC started procuring beds and mattress on Sunday, a day after making it a CCC. At other centres except VNIT, the scene was similar with doctors unaware of new norms and arrangements.

Some officials reportedly refused to report to Vanamati and Symbiosis after coming to know that positive patients would be shifted there. Symbiosis CCC in-charge referred TOI queries to NMC administration. At Vanamati, the centre in-charge was not present even though 15 asymptomatic patients were sent there.

In contrast, MLA hostel quarantine centre was converted into a CCC with full coordination among all stakeholders and sufficient time to officials to stop admitting suspects and then prepare for the CCC. The other CCC at Shalinitai Meghe Medical College also opened without any glitch.

New patients at the four CCCs complained of poor facilities and food. Many also demanded to either be sent back to hospital or to home isolation. Civil surgeon Dr Devendra Paturkar said manpower issues still persisted. “We are trying to resolve them,” he said.

Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said the chaos was because everyone wanted to go in the first batch. “Once it was announced that first-test negative suspects would be home isolated, all demanded to go on Saturday itself,” he said.

Regarding lack of facilities, Joshi said assistant municipal commissioner and chief medical officer besides himself had inspected the CCC but no one complained.

JAIPUR: Rajasthan governor Kalraj Mishra caused a flutter on Sunday when he met chief secretary Rajeeva Swarup and DGP Bhupendra Singh Yadav to discuss, among other things, security at Raj Bhavan against the backdrop of a Congress protest scheduled for Monday that the party later called off.While the main item on the official agenda for the meeting was Rajasthan’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Mishra being closeted with the heads of the civil and police administration added to the drama and intrigue of the ongoing political crisis triggered by sacked deputy CM Sachin Pilot ’s revolt against CM Ashok Gehlot .A statement issued by Raj Bhavan at 4.30pm said the chief secretary and the DGP briefed Mishra about the steps being taken to prevent any law-and-order problem during the Congress-organised protest.

PATNA: Seven people, including two in Darbhanga, have so far died and over 15 lakh affected by floods in 11 north Bihar districts. The floodwaters spread to five blocks in Saran on Sunday, making it the 11th affected district in north Bihar.

According to state disaster management department, four people in West Champaran had died in the floods earlier and over 1.36 lakh had been evacuated to safer places as 625 panchayats under 86 blocks were marooned.

Altogether 25 NDRF and SDRF teams were conducting rescue operations in Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Supaul, Kishanganj, Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, Gopalganj, East Champaran, West Champaran, Khagaria and Saran districts.

Floodwaters entered Motihari town and train service on Muzaffarpur-Narkatiyaganj section remained disrupted as water was flowing over rail bridge 248 between Sagauli and Majhauliya stations.

Floodwaters overtopped the rail tracks at Sagauli Junction in East Champaran. The diversion at 17.70km of Hayaghat Karachin embankment on Kareh river was breached, but the situation was under control, according to the state water resources department.

Except Burhi Gandak and Bagmati, all major rivers had showed a receding trend on Sunday evening, state water resources department minister Sanjay Kumar Jha said.

“Our engineers are working overtime to plug the Saturday breach in the Gandak embankment in Gopalganj. There were certain problems in transportation of goods as people in large number have come on the embankment. There was seepage/piping at Hayaghat.

395,['27/07/2020'],Gujarat adds 11 points to sex ratio at birth,"AHMEDABAD: Gujarat has recorded an increase of 11 points in sex ratio at birth in the block year of 2016-18 as compared to 2015-17. But compared to 2012-2014 the state has reported the steepest fall of 41 points — the highest in the country. The sex ratio at birth was 907 in the block year of 2012-14 in Gujarat, while the current ratio is 866.

The Sample Registration Survey 2018, released recently, reveals that the sex ratio at birth dropped constantly in rural areas of Gujarat while it kept rising in urban areas during the last two block years.

The overall gain of 11 points in sex ratio at birth between 2015-17 and 2016-18 can largely be attributed to the improvement by 27 points in urban areas in the same period.

The child sex ratio (0-6 years) meanwhile, improved by 7 points between two censuses from 883 in Census 2001 to 890 in Census 2011.

A senior state government officer wishing anonymity said that cases of girl child abortion are still heard of in north Gujarat and Saurashtra and in certain communities.

Even in healthcare and medical attention, the officer said, parents were found ready to spend for a male child, but a girl child faced neglect. He said regular raids used to be conducted earlier on radiologists, but for the past couple of years they have reduced in frequency, and mostly devolved to token affairs.

Sociologist Gaurang Jani said it is too late now to match the number of girls with that of boys. “There are several factors that contribute to the falling girl child ratio. In several communities the new generation is adopting the nuclear family model, and once the family has a girl and a boy they adopt family planning. In some cases, if a boy is born first, the family does not go for a second child.”

Not just in urban areas, but such a trend has also been observed among the young in tribal communities. “Moreover, human fertility in the state is dropping across all communities thus affecting the sex ratio. The Census 2021 is due, and I am sure it will find child sex ratio (0-6 years) has registered a decline,” Jani said.

TIRUPATI: Actor Sonu Sood came to the rescue of a farmer in Chittoor on Sunday, gifting him a tractor after a video of his two daughters pulling a plough through their agricultural fields went viral.The farmer, Nageswara Rao of KV Palli mandal, was forced to till the land without bullocks as he had no money to either buy or rent them. The family’s meagre income suffered a big jolt after the small tea stall that he ran shut down due to Covid-19 pandemic . It was then that the family of four decided to literally take things in their own hands. The young girls took the place of bullocks and parents guided the plough.His elder daughter, V Vennela (17), has completed her Intermediate and the younger one, V Chandana (15), is in class 10.Sood, who was moved by the farmer’s ordeal, responded on his Twitter account on Saturday morning and said, ‘‘Tomorrow morning he will have a pair of oxen. Let the girls focus on their education. Starting tomorrow, two oxen will plough his fields. Farmers are the pride of this nation. Protect them.”But within hours the actor changed his mind to help the family in a better way. ‘‘This family doesn’t deserve a pair of oxen. They deserve a tractor. So sending you one. By evening a tractor will be ploughing your fields. Stay blessed.”Nageswara Rao, who got an opportunity to interact with Sonu Sood through a television channel, told TOI, that the actor was a hero in real life. Sood has mostly played villains in films.“While he turned a saviour for migrant workers during the lockdown, he has come to the rescue of my family this time. We are deeply indebted to him.

According to sources with the secondary education department, there are 39 state-run and 109 state-funded secondary schools in Agra district., and around 2,300 teachers are posted in these schools.

The government order came on July 8 after the cases of the appointment of teachers based on “fake documents” surfaced in several districts. The UP additional chief secretary had ordered the constitution of a district-level committee for the verification of documents of the teachers serving in the state-owned as well as state-funded schools.

The committee includes additional district magistrate (city), district inspector of schools (DIOS), principal of government inter-college and principal of a state-funded secondary school, while the deputy director for secondary education was made the nodal officer for the verification process.

DIOS, Agra district, Ravindra Kumar had sent letters to the principals, seeking details and academic documents of teachers posted at their schools by July 15 for the verification, but 74 out of the 148 government schools have, so far, not provided the details.

“So far, only 50% of the schools have provided the academic details of the teachers on duty. The salary of the principals of those schools which have not provided the details will be withheld till they provide the required details and documents,” warned the DIOS.

403,['27/07/2020'],CB to summon top Air India officials,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The crime branch probe into fake document case involving Swapna Suresh against an Air India officer has gathered momentum following the gold smuggling case probe. The crime branch has decided to summon Air India executive director (disinvestment) Uma Maheshwari and other ICC members to Thiruvananthapuram to take their statements in the fake document case.

This will be the second time the crime branch is summoning top officials of Air India in the case. Earlier, Maheshwari, Sathiya Subramaniam, general manager (personnel), Chennai, RMS Rajen, assistant general manager (retd) and Leena Vineeth, manager, Thiruvananthapuram, were summoned by the crime branch in January this year for recording their statements.

“They will have to be summoned again since there are some missing links. We have to get more clarity on the earlier statements they gave us,” said B Anil Kumar, DSP, crime branch, who is probing the case.

Swapna had created a fake sexual harassment complaint against an Air India officer and it was probed by the internal committee (ICC) team headed by Maheshwari which had upheld the complaint. The investigation revealed that the ICC had recorded the statement of an impersonated witness, without checking the witness’ identity. The 16 women named in the complaint had revealed during investigation that the ICC of Air India neither contacted then nor recorded their statements.

However, high court had found the sexual harassment complaint itself as fake and asked the crime branch to register a case against Swapna and conduct further investigation. Swapna, who was a former employee of AISATS, and Binoy Jacob , former vice-president of AISATS, are the accused in this case.

“As part of the investigation, the earlier officer who was probing the case had sent several letters to Maheshwari and her team members to appear before the crime branch for recording statements. However, they did not turn up and had approached the high court against this. But later the high court urged them to appear before the probe team to record their statements,” said Kumar.

The complaint was forged against the Air India officer to wreak vengeance since he exposed financial irregularities at Thiruvananthapuram airport. Later, CBI found the evasion of royalty and directed AISATS to pay an amount of Rs 2,60,99,727 to Airports Authority of India, which was paid by AISATS in March 2017.

RANCHI: A minor girl (12) was allegedly raped by a youth after she left her home in Bariatu area of Ranchi on Saturday evening, police said, adding that they have arrested two persons in connection to the crime.

The girl, who otherwise lives with her maternal aunt in Delhi, had recently come to her parents’ home here. Police said the girl left the house as she wanted to go back to New Delhi.

Police said that after leaving her parents’ residence, the girl sought lift for the railway station from an unknown person, later identified as Ankit Mishra (26). They added that on the pretext of dropping her at the railway station, Ankit took her to a house owned by his friend, Anand Mohan (29), and raped the girl.

The girl’s parents approached the local police station after they failed to trace her. The girl had left her home without informing her parents and had also switched off her mobile phone. Police said that the girl was probably feeling neglected at her parents’ home.

Sadar DSP Deepak Pandey said, “Based on the statement given by the girl, police have nabbed the main accused, Ankit Mishra, along with his accomplice, Anand Mohan.” Police rescued the girl after a night-long operation. “We got the clue about her location from her aunt in Delhi, as the girl had called her up from the flat where she was held captive,” police said.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

She said, “The district administration did not let us distribute Modi Aahar (BJP’s dry ration packets) in the past out of fear of a gathering taking place amid the pandemic.

Appropriate action will be taken if we find out that violations of Covid-19 protocols took place.”Meanwhile, a JMM functionary said that distributing dry ration among the poor is a brainchild of Basan Soren, chief minister Hemant Soren’s younger brother, who is projecting himself as a probable candidate for the upcoming Dumka by-poll.

409,['27/07/2020'],"BSF jawan dies at BGH, kin allege negligence","Bokaro: A Border Security Force (BSF) jawan died allegedly after a delay in getting his Covid-19 report and inadequate treatment at the Covid ward of Bokaro General Hospital (BGH) on Sunday. Relatives of the jawan, U K Sharma, alleged medical negligence but BGH refuted the charge.

Sharma was admitted to BGH on July 22 after he had an infection in the lower respiratory tract. He also had diabetes mellitus and hypertension. His samples were taken on July 23 and the doctors allegedly kept waiting for his report before beginning the treatment.

As per BGH norms, a patient has to remain in the Covid ward till the test reports arrive after which they will be referred to a specific ward. As a result, senior doctors avoid visiting patients, who are often left at the mercy of junior doctors and nurses.

Sharma breathed his last at 3.20am. The brother of the deceased, Manoj, said, “My brother died due to lack of proper treatment.”

Notably, Sharma, a resident of Sector 9 of Bokaro Township who was posted in the 8th Battalion of BSF in West Bengal, was the second patient to die in the ward on the same night.

Manoj said, “My brother was suffering and returned home due to health problems. When his condition deteriorated, we admitted him to BGH on July 22. Though the doctors had started medication, they were waiting for his Covid test reports to begin proper treatment after shifting him to the related ward.”

Sharma’s wife Kalpana alleged that the junior doctor were often casual during their rounds. “They didn’t go through his case history properly. My husband’s condition deteriorated late at night and despite repeated requests, no senior doctor came. He died in pain.”

Chas SDO Shashi Prakash Singh said they have directed BGH to conduct a probe. He said, “I called the director (medical services) of BGH, Dr A K Singh, and asked him to be more proactive in dealing with patients. I have also directed him to inquire into the incident and take action against those found guilty.”

Meanwhile, BSL chief of communication Manikant Dhan denied any negligence on their part. “There is no question of negligence. The deceased was suffering from lower respiratory tract infection, diabetes mellitus and hypertension (drug defaulter). He was on relevant medications (antibiotic, anti-diabetic and anti-hypertensive drugs). The doctor visited both in the morning and evening (last visit at 7.30pm). He turned critical at 3am and expired due to cardio-respiratory failure.”

Notably, Bokaro registered more deaths of suspected Covid-19 patients than those who tested positive. In the past 20 days, more than seven patients died in the Covid ward due to a delay in reports.

They also demanded immediate release of the amount to the kin of the deceased.

Talking to TOI, Singh said, “We have already met DGP M V Rao and had voiced our concern in this regard last week but the state government hasn’t taken a call on it yet.

JAMSHEDPUR: With no trains plying during the Unlock phase and unable to afford a flight, a 26-year-old woman drove a two-wheeler along with her friend from Pune to Jamshedpur , a distance of 1,800km, to meet her sick five-year-old son.

Sonia Das, a resident of Bhatia Basti in Kadma, became restless when her husband, Abhishek Ghosh, called up and said their son, Dhruv Jyoti, fell ill and developed fever. She immediately tagged the Jharkhand government on the official Twitter handle and asked for help but got no response. She also rang up the Maharashtra helpline number without any success. Sonia then decided to drive her old scooter to her hometown. Fortunately, her friend Sabia Bano, a resident of Pune, decided to travel with her.

On Monday morning, Sonia and Sabia began their arduous journey and arrived in the Steel City on Friday. Soon after their arrival, they were detained for a few hours by the health authorities for Covid-19 test. “We conducted rapid antigen tests, we let them go after they tested negative and asked them to stay in home quarantine,"" DSP (Headquarters II) Arvind Kumar said. He also said dry ration for 30 days has been provided to the family.

Talking to TOI, Sonia said, “Passenger trains are not running between Tatanagar and Pune or Mumbai. Moreover, my husband and I do not have sufficient money to buy an air ticket. With no help coming from Jharkhand and Maharashtra governments, I decided to drive as I was extremely worried about my son.”

With tears welling up in her eyes, Sonia said, ""Thankfully, we did not face any problems and spent the nights in petrol pumps and dhabas. I am now desperate to hug my child. I am hoping that the quarantine period is over soon.""

“I am thankful to the authorities for conducting the Covid test within a short time,” Sonia said, adding that her son is recuperating.

Sonia had been working with a small-time production house in Mumbai and travelled on the scooter during work. She, however, lost her job during the lockdown. When all options ran out, she went to Pune where Sabia stays to look for a job as her husband’s income had also dried up. For the last three months, she was unable to pay the rent.

Her friend Sabia added, “Apprehending the risk she was going to face while travelling alone, I decided to accompany Sonia. Initially, I was not convinced with the idea of a scooter ride but with no option available, I chose to go along. We stayed at 10 petrol pumps and two dhabas.”

JAIPUR: Having received proposals and demands from the sarpanches, the state’s rural development department may consider giving authority to the gram panchayats to float tenders for procuring material component under MGNREGA. Currently, the tender process for procurement of material component is carried out at the block or panchayat samiti level.

“A few sarpanches demanded a change in the process of procurement of material components in MGNREGA. They have demanded that the tendering should be done at the gram panchayat level, instead of the panchayat samiti level, which is currently in operation,” said an official in the rural development and panchyati raj department.

“The existing process has been mandated by the government of India (GOI). So, it is required to be seen whether the changes can be made without violating the GOI circular. The discussions are at the preliminary stage and clearance has to be given in this regard by GOI. We also have to see whether it is desirable or not. For now, the existing process will continue,” said the official.

Moreover, the decision has to be taken at the chief secretary and additional chief secretary level before seeking a clearance from the central government.

414,['27/07/2020'],"Vizag: Six, including two doctors, arrested for selling baby","Picture for representational purpose only.

VISAKHAPATNAM: Vizag city police on Sunday arrested six persons for allegedly selling off a new-born baby boy to a couple in Kolkata. Two of the six arrested are doctors. Those arrested have been identified as: Dr Patchipala Namrata, managing director of Universal Srusti Hospital in Vizag, Dr Tirmala, who worked at Universal Srusti Hospital, K Venkata Lakshmi (an Asha worker), B Annapurna (Asha worker), A Ramakrishna and L Chandra Mohan.

Vizag police commissioner RK Meena said that a widow from rural parts of Visakhapatnam had an affair and became pregnant. Upon coming to know of her pregnancy through her agent Ramakrishna, Dr Namrata, asked the woman to come to her hospital for delivery. The woman gave birth in March and the doctor along with her associates sold the baby to a couple in Kolkata.

However, an Anganwadi teacher named G Sarojini had come to know about the widow’s pregnancy. When the widow returned to her home, Sarojini asked her about the baby. When the woman could not offer a satisfactory answer, Sarojini grew suspicious and alerted Childline and ICDS officials.

While Childline personnel were probing the matter, Chandra Mohan— an associate of Dr Namrata, brought the baby back from Kolkata and handed him over to Childline on March 20. The baby boy has been put in custody of Sishu Gruha in Vizag.

City police chief RK Meena said that the police investigated the case on the basis of a complaint lodged by the baby’s mother. Investigation revealed that Dr Namrata used to run a hospital called Srusti Test Tube Baby. She later changed the name of the hospital to Universal Srusti Fertility and Research Centre in 2018, after being involved with two criminal cases. She opened branches in Hyderabad, Vijayawada, Bhubaneswar and Kolkata.

Dr Namrata used to conduct free medical camps in rural areas in north Andhra Pradesh and Odisha allegedly in an attempt to identify unwanted pregnancies through local agents and Asha workers. Upon finding women with unwanted pregnancies, she would offer to deliver the babies free of cost if they chose to donate their new-borns.

Upon procuring such babies, the doctor used to sell the babies to rich childless couples through agents. She also generated fake birth certificates of the babies. In this case, the baby boy was named Siyan Roy, the city police chief said.

“We are investigating the case through multiple angles to find the number of babies sold by Dr Namrata. We arrested her in Karnataka and will soon arrest the Kolkata-based couple who purchased the baby,” commissioner RK Meena added.

415,['27/07/2020'],"Compact residential settings, industrial units are new hotspots","Margao: Compact residential settings and industrial estates are turning out to be areas of concern for the South Goa district administration in the task of managing the pandemic.

The Cuncolim industrial estate housing several steel units employing hundreds of migrant workers, and compact residential area of Gogol housing board, Margao, are currently under the radar of the South Goa district administration following a spurt in cases.

After several employees from several industrial units in the Cuncolim industrial estate tested positive, the district administration has directed all steel industries operating in Cuncolim to get their workers tested.

“We are keeping a strict watch on all the 6-7 steel units operational in the Cuncolim industrial estate. We have directed the owners of the units to allow only those workers who have tested negative into factory premises. We have collected the addresses of all workers of the industrial estate. This will enable us to quickly trace the location of any particular worker if and when he tests positive,” Salcete mamlatdar Prataprao Gaonkar told TOI.

Once a person tests positive, the district administration keeps a tab on his movements aided by digital technology until he is shifted to the Covid hospital/care centre by the health authorities.

Sources said the district administration has veered around to the view that instead of ordering blanket closure of the industries, which would invariably affect the economy, it would be pragmatic to allow the units to function but with all precautionary measures in place and a constant watch by the authorities. “We have imposed several conditions on all the industrial units. We are ensuring that there is 100% compliance with the directions,” Gaonkar said.

The authorities are also keeping a close watch on the emerging situation in the Gogol housing board area. Health department officials said that six members from two families got infected after they came in contact with a patient from a neighbouring house, who later succumbed to the infection. “We have taken 40 throat swab samples for testing — 30 from the immediate first level contacts and 10 randomly from a wider area. The reports are awaited,” a health official said. A decision about imposing any containment measures will be taken based on the reports.

Though there’s a clamour for mass testing in the affected areas, the district administration has decided to go by the rule book in order to ease the pressure on testing centres. An official explained the strategy adopted in the case of Arlem, Raia, which has now been declared a containment zone: “Once three positive cases were detected from a slum-like area in Arlem, the health authorities swung into action and drew 30 samples at random from a population of around 200. As 18 tested positive, the area was declared a containment zone.”

The authorities have also adopted a pay-and-test rule for industrial units willing to get their employees tested. An official said, “The industrial firms have been directed to pay for the tests of their employees. However, if anybody tests positive, it is the obligation of the health authorities to do the contact tracing and testing exercise.”

The university, which released the vacancy list on Sunday, has set 1pm Monday as the deadline to exercise the web options. Surprisingly, Kaloji Narayana Rao University of Health Sciences (KNRUHS) of Telangana has allowed all the candidates to exercise the option.

Students alleged that NTR health university’s decision will only help candidates with lower ranks get better seats. Sources said several students who are at the top in the merit list are believed to have blocked seats in the most in-demand branches like general medicine in AP’s private colleges. However, they finally opted for seats in premier institutions such as Osmania Medical College.

Although, there is nothing wrong in opting for a better college, it is, however, not clear as to why they have deliberately blocked seats in private colleges in AP and left them unoccupied in the second round. Since the top rankers blocked some good branches, the rankers next in the line are forced to go for other streams, including non-clinical ones.

VISAKHAPATNAM: Lawyers in Visakhapatnam have once again raised the demand to shift Andhra Pradesh State Human Rights Commission (APSHRC) to Andhra Pradesh from Hyderabad. The lawyers want the commission office to be set up either in Visakhapatnam or Vijayawada.

Lawyers said that there have been growing instances of human rights violations during the Covid-19 pandemic and that there is an urgent need to shift the APSHRC to Andhra Pradesh to deal with grievances of the people of the state.

The Forum of Legal Professionals (FLP) on Sunday demanded that the state government take immediate steps to relocate APSHRC. FLP members said that almost all government institutions which were located in Hyderabad before bifurcation have been shifted but not the human rights commission.

They further said that there is an acute shortage of manpower in the commission and the post of the chairman is also lying vacant. FLP president and senior advocate Kuppili Muralidhar said that there is a greater need to sensitise people and law enforcement agencies towards human rights.

“There are growing instances of violation of human rights during the pandemic. For instance, we frequently hear of people being denied a dignified cremation or burial. Further, some hospitals refuse to admit patients and there is discrimination against Covid-19 patients. It is for this reason that the APSHRC must be moved to Andhra Pradesh. People should not have to travel to Telangana to get be heard, Muralidhar added.

Senior lawyer and Congress spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said even a beginner in legal education knew that the governor had absolutely no authority to link the assembly session to court cases, ask the CM about the agenda of the session and question the logistics of transporting MLAs. He said “the simple and binding” constitutional provision is that the governor has to call the session as demanded by the state cabinet.

“These frivolous, superfluous and motivated questions are like asking what is the colour of the sky? By the time you answer it’s blue, two days will pass in the exchange of letters. The questions asked by Raj Bhavan are dilatory tactics... the cat is out of the bag,” said Singhvi at a media conference. He said “the otherwise eloquent” PM Modi has turned into a “mauni baba” on the “defiling of the Constitution” because Mishra was acting at his behest.

Singhvi slammed high court for accepting the petition on the disqualification notices issued by the speaker to Sachin Pilot and18 MLAs. “AreHCs not obliged to follow binding fivejudge Supreme Court judgments which have held the field for over 30 years? That the Speaker is non-interferable in disqualification notices,” Singhvi said.

Tracing what he called was a long history of constitutional provision that the governor was bound to act on the advice of the state government on convening the assembly, Singhvi said the Constituent Assembly had considered giving the governor discretion on the issue. “That draft clause was dropped...” he said.

Making minimal investment, they have turned their cars into mobile shops selling various items right from clothes, snacks, fruits and vegetables to even trinkets.

Abdul Nadar from Cavelossim earned his living as a tourist taxi driver before the pandemic came along and closed down the hospitality industry and turned his life upside down. Left struggling for income, Nadar said he hit on the idea of turning his car into a mobile shop.

Today he sells trinkets, cosmetics and even kitchen products, which he said allows him to take home Rs 500-600 at the end of the day after paying sopo taxes. “Before March this year my monthly salary was Rs 10,000 plus tips,” Nadar told TOI.

“I bought some women’s items like bindis, lipsticks, kerchiefs and face masks, which are in demand, some kitchen products like strainers and graters, sought permission from various panchayats and parked in their jurisdiction by paying only sopo,” he said.

Krishna Humbe from Navelim, a seafarer , had a similar story. He was nearly at the end of his contract when the virus struck.

“I lost around two months due to the delay in coming home and then being in quarantine for fourteen days. I realised that the economic situation was bleak and the very next day after my quarantine period concluded, I turned my car into a mobile store. I picked some fruits and vegetables and started selling them,” Humbe said.

He has three children and Humbe said he could not afford to stay at home and only depend on savings, which would dwindle quickly.

“So I thought that instead of idling away my time I should try my hand at selling fruits and vegetables.”

Today he earns around Rs 500 a day, which he said is better than nothing.

The DoE has allowed teachers and non-teaching staff of special schools too to work from home till July 31. But heads of institutions have been asked to maintain contact numbers of all teachers so they can be called as and when the need arises. School heads have been told to obtain plans on weekly basis from teachers on the academic activities being carried out by them.

Sanjay centre for special education, with three institutes in the state and hundreds of students, had begun extending help to its students in April through its team of physiotherapy experts through the electronic medium.

Parents ensure that their children do the physiotherapy exercises at home and are then asked to send videos of the sessions to the physiotherapists at the school to ensure continuity in therapy.

The home programme is an important part of the therapy which helps to ensure that the children do not have tightening of the muscles due to the break in sessions.

Due to the Covid-19 lockdown, children with special needs have no access to one-on-one physiotherapy sessions.

Sources in the public works department (PWD) said the project is in its nascent stages and the alignment is yet to be finalised for the work.

Following some claims that 13,000 trees will be felled, PWD minister Deepak Pauskar had said in January this year that permission is likely to be sought from the forest department for the cutting of 1,500 trees in Karmal Ghat.

Locals and activists have demanded that construction of a tunnel be considered to avoid the felling of trees for the road widening project.

The initial draft feasibility report prepared by the PWD shows that a similar tunnel was proposed while widening the road through Karmal Ghat from two-lane to four-lane. The PWD itself had said that though it would be more time-consuming to construct a tunnel, it would allow vehicles to move through this stretch at a higher speed of 100kmph.

The report also states that after the construction the vegetation of forest cover will be reinstated over the tunnel of length 1.45km.

A petition by greens to the central government states that Karmal Ghat is classified as north western ghats moist deciduous dorests and hosts populations of wild cats, slender loris, pangolin, bison, four-horned antelope, mouse deer, giant squirrel among many other rare, endemic and threatened species of flora and fauna.

While condemning the government’s decision regarding the IIT project without the consent of the panchayat and the gram sabha, the villagers resolved that a special gram sabha should be convened soon.

The villagers also criticised health minister and Valpoi MLA Vishwajit Rane, who they said “is trying to take away their properties in order to construct an IIT”.

A senior citizen, Shobawati Melekar, said that even during the Portuguese regime the villagers fiercely protected their lands, but now “just because the elderly persons from the village are illiterate” the government is trapping them by trying to take away their properties. “We will never allow the IIT project in Melauli and we are ready to do anything to ensure this,” she said.

NEW DELHI: Urging people not to lower their guard, PM Narendra Modi on Sunday said coronavirus is still as fatal as it was in the beginning when the contagion appeared on the global scene.

During his monthly radio address ‘ Mann ki Baat ’, he urged citizens to take a pledge of freedom from the pandemic on August 15 and also resolve for self-reliant India on the lines of the ‘ Atmanirbhar Bharat ’ he had announced. His message comes at a time when curbs are easing and it is being felt that the public at large is becoming slack in observing social distancing and use of masks and cases of infection are rising.

Modi said the hazards of coronavirus are far from over and at many places it is spreading fast. “We need to be extra vigilant. We have to bear in mind that corona is as fatal today as it was in the beginning — that’s why we have to be fully cautions,” he said.

Modi will on Monday launch “high throughput” Covid-19 testing facilities in three locations via video conferencing. This comes as India aims to ramp up collective coronavirus testing capacity to 10 lakh tests per day.

“High throughput” research refers to automation of experiments where largescale repetitions are made feasible. These facilities will not only ramp up testing capacity but also strengthen early detection and treatment of coronavirus, which is expected to assist the country in controlling the spread of the pandemic. The three high-throughput testing facilities to be launched by the PM have been set up strategically at ICMR’s centres in Noida, Mumbai and Kolkata.

PANAJI: The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay, has asked the Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) for the Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring System (CAAQMS) and the National Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP) data of six locations from the port town to assess the air pollution at Vasco during the lockdown .

IIT-Bombay, which has been tasked with conducting a source appropriation study at Vasco following allegations of coal pollution in the town, requires data on movement of rakes, trucks and ships. The board has to submit the information for the period January to June 2019 and for May 2020.

The IIT’s environmental science and engineering department (CESE), in a letter to the board, said that data across six stations is needed in order to assess the effect of lockdown on air pollution for the period. Similar data for the comparative period from previous years is also required from the same stations, the IIT told GSPCB.

The institute has completed data collection for the second phase of the study and chemical analysis is in progress.

Speaking to TOI, chairman of GSPCB, Ganesh Shetgaonkar, had said that IIT-Bombay has submitted the interim report after completing the first phase of study.

The final report will indicate the exact quantity of coal, bauxite and other dust particles present in the air.

The source appropriation study is aimed at allowing the government to determine the reason behind the air pollution in the town.

The first phase report stated that coal is not the only mineral behind the air pollution in the town. A senior GSPCB officer said that the interim report was not exactly to pinpoint the reason with regards to pollution in Vasco but the second phase study will give details about the source of pollution.

The first phase began in April and was completed on May 2018. The Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) will bear the cost of the entire study, which has been pegged at over Rs 94 lakh, a senior GSPCB officer had said.

Identification of sampling locations, monitoring ambient air quality, and locating pollution sources are part of the study’s scope, and will be carried out as per guidelines of the central pollution control board.

But Biocon had noted that it is a drug that was approved previously for psoriasis, and this was only a label extension. It also said the emergency procedures for getting a clearance for use on Covid-19 patients were as per international norms.On Sunday, following the ministry’s statement, Biocon said in a statement: “The National Covid Task Force needs to see more evidence and we will provide them large real world data to enable the committee to reconsider its decision on inclusion of itolizumab in the protocol. Nearly 1,000 patients have used the drug across the country with good outcome data.”It went on to day: “Also, we have already announced that we have planned for a 200 patient pan India phase 4 trial to be conducted across 10-15 hospitals.

441,['27/07/2020'],Karnataka Lockdown News: Karnataka awaits Centre’s nod to open film theatres from August 1,"‘Theatres ready to resume screening’

BENGALURU: With the Centre signalling it’s ready to allow multiplexes and theatres to reopen, the Karnataka entertainment industry is hoping to return to business from August 1.Sources said the Union ministry of information and broadcast has recommended the resumption of film exhibition and this is being favourably considered by the ministry of home affairs (MHA), which is preparing the guidelines for Unlock 3.0.Besides theatres and multiplexes, other services which have remained shut since mid-March are educational institutions, Metro rail, gymnasiums, swimming pools, liquor consumption at pubs and bars. The government was positively looking at reopening these services early this month, but had to put the plan on hold as confirmed Covid-19 cases in the state have been rising at an alarming rate in the past 3-4 weeks.“We are getting clear signals that the government would green-light the proposal of lifting the ban on film screening in theatres as the industry is completely prepared to comply with the new normal of social distancing and other norms post Covid-19,” said Pramod Arora, CEO of PVR Cinemas.The state government, whose focus is on striking a balance between the operations to rein in the Covid-19 pandemic and revive the economy, is said to be open to the idea if the Centre gave its nod.Chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Friday made it clear to a delegation of multiplex owners that his government was in favour of resumption of all activities of the film industries, including production and exhibition.The CM has, in principle, agreed to allow film screening . Now, we have to wait for the Centre’s guidelines,” said Uday Garudachar, BJP MLA and owner of Garuda Mall.While the industry is jubilant, the dampener is the likely chances of restricting the occupancy in theatres to 25% of their capacity. “Owners of all 615 single-screen theatres are ready to resume film exhibition. But it is the government’s responsibility to address business concerns of the industry. We expect a special financial package,” said KV Chandrashekhar, president of Karnataka Film Exhibitors Association.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77188573,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-132162,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-awaits-centres-nod-to-open-film-theatres-from-august-1/articleshow/77188569.cms

MUMBAI: The state is likely to extend the capping on hospital charges and rates for Covid and non-Covid treatment in private hospitals for another three months. The scheme that allowed local authorities to take control of 80%beds in private hospitals and regulate treatment costs expires on August 31.

A senior official said a final decision was awaited, but plans are to extend it till November–end owing to a surge in infections statewide. “By that time, we are hopeful that the pandemic will settle down and the caseload will be manageable in the government sector ,” the official said.

Rapid rise in incidence in the Mumbai-Pune corridor, in particular, has left the state unequal to the task of managing without the help of private facilities. Several leading hospitals in Mumbai confirmed that up to 20% of their ICU beds were occupied by patients from urban centres around the city.

Dr Sudhakar Shinde, CEO of the State Health Assurance Society, who helped draft the scheme, said patients are coming to Mumbai in big numbers. “Mumbai’s cases may have flattened… but tertiary hospitals are seeing a major influx. It only shows that people are going to need beds in private sector,” he said. Patients are coming from as far as Pune, Dhule, Jalgaon, he said.

In Pune particularly, Shinde said, ICU beds were in short supply. Health minister Rajesh Tope on Friday said Pune was facing a shortage as allocation of beds in private hospitals was not well implemented. Dr Shinde said, in all, merely 18% of Covid patients have so far taken treatment in the private sector. “So capping is an option to ensure equitable and quality treatment for everybody,” he said.

Maharashtra was the first state to limit treatment costs following complaints of profiteering and enable civic corporations to regulate bed allocation even in private hospitals through a civic helpline. BMC commissioner IS Chahal reiterated on Saturday that the bed shortage at the peak of the pandemic could be resolved only after the private hospitals were brought on board. Now Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana are among states that have followed Maharashtra’s example and capped treatment charges.

Corporate and trust-run hospitals though have been crying hoarse about the losses they are suffering due to the price cap. Before the May 22 circular when rates to 80% of beds were fixed, the state was toying with a plan to cap charges for all the beds. But the Association of Hospitals (AOH), a body of trust-run institutions including Nanavati, Lilavati, Breach Candy, Jaslok, urged the state against it. On Sunday, an AOH official said, “We are still a month away before the notification expires. We will begin talks with the state. It’s important to gauge how much the scheme has benefited people.”

GUWAHATI/PATNA: Floods continue to wreak havoc in eastern parts of the country. On Sunday, three more people died in Assam taking the toll past 100, while seven people lost their lives in Bihar .

PM Modi in his monthly Mann ki Baat expressed his solidarity with all those affected by floods and heavy rainfall in Assam and Bihar. “A large part of the country is grappling with floods. Many areas of states such as Bihar and Assam are having to deal with a series of difficulties due to the floods. … all governments, NDRF teams, disaster response teams and self-help groups are working in tandem to provide relief and rescue in all possible ways,” Modi said.

According to the daily flood bulletin by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), 23 districts are still affected, impacting nearly 25 lakh people, about 1.5 lakh less than Saturday. Almost 46,000 people have taken shelter in 269 government relief camps. The overall flood situation, however, improved on Sunday as water levels of all major rivers started receding.

However, Central Water Commission (CWC) has predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall in Assam and Meghalaya from Tuesday. Nearly 85% of Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNPTR) has been inundated. P Sivakumar, director, KNPTR, said the water level was receding in the park, but the speed was “very slow”.

Bihar water resources department minister Sanjay Kumar Jha said, except Burhi Gandak and Bagmati, all major rivers had showed a receding trend on Sunday evening.

However, the CWC, in its bulletin stated that rivers in Bihar were flowing in ‘above normal flood situation’ in many downstream locations with falling trend and are likely to further fall in two to three days. Although, rainfall is likely to rise in Bihar on July 29 and 30, the CWC said. In north Bihar, over 15 lakh people have been affected According to state disaster management department, nearly 1.4 lakh had been evacuated as 625 panchayats were marooned.

BHOPAL: Ever heard of a vegetable market running in a sports stadium, that has been set up to harness state and national-level athletes? Satna’s Dada Sukhendra Singh Stadium , a sports complex of the sports department, was a makeshift vegetable market till Saturday. After objections by the sports department, the district administration finally evicted the vegetable market from the stadium.

The venue has been built for athletes, as the sports department is trying to bring athletes to grounds. However, the Satna stadium is often used for activities other than sports. District sports officer (DSO) Ahmed Khan said that he had informed the sports department about the problems being faced in conducting sports activities at the stadium.

“I belong to the sports department. I had informed the department about it. After the intervention of the sports department, the vegetable market has been shifted to another place,” said Khan.

Even athletes feel that the stadium should have never be used for any other activity. “I am unable to understand the logic of converting the stadium into a vegetable market. There were several other places in Satna district where the market could have been shifted instead of the sports ground,” said an athlete, without quoting his name.

Another athlete said that their training suffers a lot due to the vegetable market. “Already due to Covid activities related to sports have been affected. When the sports department opened the ground across the district administration of Satna went on to convert the stadium into a vegetable market,” said another athlete.

He said, “Thankfully, the market has been shifted. I am hoping that the district administration will not do it again.”

When contacted, Satna collector Ajay Katesaria admitted that the stadium was converted into a vegetable market. “We have removed the market from the stadium to another place,” said collector Katesaria.

Asked the reason for shifting the market to a stadium, he said, “Due to waterlogging issues, the market was shifted to the stadium. As there is , the hardly any rain now, the market has been shifted back.” Asked as to whether he will shift it again to the stadium when the rain comes, the collector said, “I can’t reply at this stage.”

BENGALURU: A 35-year-old pourakarmika with coronavirus infection died while being shifted to a hospital with a spare ventilator on Saturday evening. Raghu Vel, a resident of MRS Palya, is the second BBMP pourakarmika and at least the third corona warrior to succumb to Covid-19 in the past two weeks after a reported struggle for treatment, a bed or ventilator.

Raghu had developed fever on Wednesday and took leave from work. On Saturday morning, he went to Sir CV Raman General Hospital and took a rapid antigen test that turned positive. He was immediately hospitalised, but at 4.30pm, he started experiencing breathing issues and doctors said he needed ventilator support. All the ventilators at the hospital were occupied.

His colleagues said they tried for three hours, but could not arrange a ventilator bed. “BBMP officials from Pulikeshinagar subdivision, where Raghu worked, also tried their best, but all the hospitals they contacted said they didn’t have spare ventilators. Finally, Akash Hospital in Devanahalli said that it had the system, and we decided to take him there. He died just as we were entering the hospital,” said a relative, Dass S, who is also a representative of BBMP pourakarmikas.

Raghu is survived by wife and three young daughters. “I don’t know how we will live without him,” said his wife, Sireesh.

Dass said Raghu was the second pourakarmika to die without proper treatment in the state capital. “If the government cannot protect the lives of pourakarmikas, who are frontline workers and corona warriors, we are going to stop our daily work,” he said.

On July 16, 28-year-old pourakarmika Shilpa Prasad, who had also contracted Covid-19, died after a delay in getting treatment. Seven hospitals allegedly refused to admit her.

Later that day, BBMP informed the Karnataka high court that four pourakarmikas had died of Covid-19 and 15 were undergoing treatment for the infection. Officials assured the court that all 17,491 pourakarmikas of BBMP would be screened for the disease and provided with personal protection equipment (PPE) kits and other safety gear.

The civic body also claimed that it was paying Rs 10 lakh compensation and Rs 20,000 towards funeral expenses to the kin of each victim.

Another corona warrior, school teacher Dilnaz Begum, also died on Saturday. She is suspected to have contracted the virus while conducting door-to-door surveys to identify people with influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). Three hospitals allegedly refused to admit her, insisting on a test report.

BENGALURU: One-and-a half months after a cigarette distributor was robbed of Rs 45.5 lakh, his employee and three teenagers have landed in custody.

Officials on Saturday recovered Rs 31,86,500, including Rs 9 lakh hidden in a car tyre, from the gang. Mohammed Ishak, 25, salesman of distributor Rakesh Pokarna, 45, is the main accused. His associates Mohammed Parvez, 19, Mohammed Adnan, 19, and Afnan Pasha, 19, are college dropouts. They splurged over Rs 13 lakh on buying iPhones and clothes.

The robbery occurred on June 11 when Pokarana was returning home in his car. He is a distributor for a major cigarette brand in Bengaluru and over 100 salesmen work with him.

He had collected cash from his salesmen, kept it in his car’s glove compartment and was returning home via Lingarajapuram. At 6.25pm, a biker rammed the car. His driver Chandru didn’t stop the car, but the biker kept following them, blaring the horn. Finally, Chandru stopped the car near Clarence Public School and got down. The driver and the biker were arguing when the pillion rider got down and took away the cash box. Two more knife-wielding miscreants joined in when Pokarana, who was in the backseat, tried to snatch the box back. “They sped away in two bikes which had no number plates,” police said.

The accused shared the loot equally. Ishak spent Rs 2 lakh from his share and hid Rs 9 lakh in a car tyre and kept it in his sister’s house at Bethamangala in Kolar district. The other three accused hid their shares in the houses of their friends in Bengaluru, after spending a part of it. “We had CCTV footages and suspected Ishak’s involvement. We recovered three mobile phones and three two-wheelers from the accused. They appear to be first-time offenders,” an officer said.

Nithiin and Shalini entered the wedding venue wearing masks and the hosts ensured that all social distancing measures were followed. With a disinfectant tunnel at the entrance and contactless sanitisers at every step, all necessary precautions were taken to keep the Covid-19 threat at bay.The decor radiated a classic, romantic and fairytale-ish character with pink, red, white and lavender flowers everywhere blending into the ivory colured backdrop. Baubles holding roses and lanterns emanating a soft, golden light added to the beauty of it all. The pièce de résistance however was a beautiful, old-school chandelier that brought the whole thing together. While Nithiin wore a traditional red embroidered sherwani paired with white bottoms, the bride Shalini opted for more modern colours — a gorgeous off-white and gold pattu saree paired with an intricately embroidered rust orange blouse. She paired her saree with matching diamond buttalu, necklace, bangles, maang tikka and a nose ring that completed the outfit.“The guest list was limited to immediate family and very close friends. Actor Pawan Kalyan and director Trivikram, who are both close to Nithiin, had attended the Pellikoduku function on Friday to avoid larger gatherings on the wedding day,” shared a source close to the actor.Nithiin and Shalini had initially planned to tie the knot at a destination wedding in Dubai but the Covid-19 pandemic had put paid to their plans.

452,['27/07/2020'],ED attaches Rs 3.9cr assets of IRS officer in corruption case,"Kolkata: The Enforcement Directorate has attached property worth nearly Rs 3.9 crore in connection with its probe against Neeraj Singh, former additional director of the Income Tax department who was posted in Kolkata. A property in Mumbai worth nearly Rs 3.2 crore, apart from bank balance worth Rs 73 lakh, was attached by the central investigating agency.

Earlier last year, ED had questioned Singh in connection with the Rose Valley case and his alleged involvement with a Kolkata-based accountant. In a press statement, ED said the accountant acted as a “frontman” for Singh and “laundered proceeds of crime”. It also alleged that Singh bought the Mumbai property from the money routed through “a number of companies” floated by the accountant.

“The property they have attached does not belong to me and is in the name of a person who is not a family member. Me and my wife do not even own a house. I have one bank account where my salary is debited. Since ED froze debit into that account, I am left with no provision to pay bills for my chemotherapy. In fact, my wife’s account is frozen as well,” Singh said.

Singh said he came to know the accountant through his father and has not spoken to the person in the last five years. “It was after the case started that I came to know about the accountant’s connection with the Rose Valley Group. Since he has a number of clients, he will not divulge that to me. I have supplied all documents to ED and there has not been any non-compliance on my part,” Singh said.

Even after repeated pleas from the district officials, the son refused to go near the father’s body or take part in the last journey to the crematorium at Bhuiyandih in Steel City. Finally, the deceased’s daughter agreed to perform the last rites. He has another daughter, who lives in Kolkata.Sources said the septuagenarian was admitted to the Tata Main Hospital on July 11 after he complained of breathlessness, but his first Covid test came negative. A test performed on July 17, however, returned positive. The man died on July 24 during treatment.Notably, a similar incident happened in Kadma area earlier, where a man refused to perform the final rites of his father suspecting that the latter was Covid positive. The neighbours of the deceased had conducted the last rites of the man then.Shops closed: The shopkeepers in Potka on the outskirts of Jamshedpur have decided to keep their shops closed for a week in view of the rising cases of Covid-19 in the district. They have informed the administration about their decision. Sources said the shopkeepers decided to take the step as markets have become hotspots for transmission of the virus, with hardly anyone following Covid protocols like maintaining social distancing, among others.

Many among those awaiting results said they had approached the hospital administration on a couple of occasions, but to no avail.The final theory examinations of third year post graduate students were conducted between June 15 to 25 and the oral and practical examinations were scheduled to be completed by July 6 in order to get the results at the earliest. Barring radiology, all other departments had completed their practical/oral examinations by July 14 and the tabulation was submitted to the Rims administration by July 16.As the administration didn’t submit the results to the University till July 24, the results got delayed.“We had met the director in the first week of July and had requested her to expedite the process so that we can provide our services to the health department. Every time we approached her, she said our results will be declared by July 25. Now, university officials are telling us that they need time to publish the results,” said one of the PG students.Dean (academic) Dr Satish Chandra said, “The practical examination of the radiology department was delayed as externals were not available for conducting the examinations due to travel restrictions owing to Covid-19. We sent the results to Ranchi University as soon as the examination concluded on July 22, but the results are yet to be declared.”When contacted, Ranchi University officials said the results aren’t being published as the term of the controller of examinations ended on July 23 and they are yet to someone and only after that will the results be published.“We had requested the academic section to send the results of the other departments to the University so that the results can be announced. Just because of one department, more than 120 students are not being able to provide their services to the state in the hour of need,” said another PG student.",ranchi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rims-laxity-delays-results-120-docs-idle-amid-covid-spike-in-state/articleshow/77187492.cms
456,['27/07/2020'],"Despite hints of relaxations, cinema hall owners ‘the end’","Ranchi: Cinema hall owners of both single screens and multiplexes in Jharkhand are not optimistic about their future even as the Centre is mulling to allow their operation from the next month.

Prashant Kumar Singh, secretary of Jharkhand Cine Exhibitors’ Association (JCEA), on Sunday said, “Reopening cinema halls will lead to further financial losses for the 35-odd single screen halls as low footfall will not give them enough revenue to make up for the operational costs.”

Many owners are also planning to shut down their establishments. “At present, no movie is being shot. The ones which are ready are not being released. I am planning to shut down my hall and venture into something else,” Singh said.

“With cases rising sharply every day, there is a sense of fear among denizens. Even if the Centre allows us to open, as is being discussed, there will be little footfall in the cinema halls due to the fear of getting infected,” he added.

Multiplexes in Jharkhand are also anticipating low footfall and a rise in operational costs. “It is almost certain that even if we can open, there will be a cap on the maximum sitting capacity to maintain social distancing. The number of shows will have to be brought down as more time will have to be devoted towards complete sanitization of the halls between shows,” an official of a popular multiplex, located on Main Road, said on condition of anonymity.

A Ranchi-based single screen owner Birendra Kumar said, “During the lockdown, I had to pay my staff their monthly wages. There was no relaxation in the electricity bills as well. Even if we open, the operational costs cannot be met as people won’t come to the halls for the fear of getting infected.”

458,['27/07/2020'],Longer ICU stays keep critical care out of reach for many in Kolkata,"KOLKATA: As the number of critical Covid-19 cases rise, the average occupancy period of ICU beds has doubled in several private hospitals across Kolkata. This has denied admission to scores of patients who need emergency critical care, even as more ICU patients are now getting cured.At least three hospitals have added more ICU beds over the last fortnight.Till early July, the average occupancy of a Covid ICU bed at Ruby General Hospital had been just four days. This has now shot up to eight days, forcing the hospital to add four more ICU beds. It has created a backlog of patients waiting to get into ICU, said general manager-operations, Subhasish Datta. “We were forced to add more ICU beds since the number of critical patients has swelled. But waiting time has risen, which is why we are extending the ICU unit,” said Datta, adding that more patients were now getting cured after ICU admission.At Medica Superspecialty Hospital, the number of ICU beds has gone up to 75 from about 50 a month ago, and there have been at least a dozen patients waiting over the last one week. Average occupancy period has jumped from 4-5 days to 8-9 days. “We have seen a spurt in the number of critical cases,” said Medica chairperson Alok Roy.“More than half of all Covid patients seeking admission are elderly, in need of oxygen, and who require an ICU bed straightaway. Their recovery is often turning out to be slow, due to co-morbidities. But longer occupancy has been an obstacle, and it left us with no other alternative than adding beds. We are close to the limit now,” said Medica chairperson Alok Roy.A reason why occupancy period has gone up is that critical Covid patients are not recovering from associated problems even after they turn negative for the virus itself, pointed out Fortis Hospital pulmonologist Raja Dhar. “Earlier, more mild patients would be admitted to ICUs. As the total number of affected has gone up, we have more critical patients with severe co-morbidities like lung injury and muscle weakness, which are keeping them confined to bed even after recovering from Covid. So, while the mildly symptomatic are now released earlier, the recovery time for the critical is now longer,” said Dhar. The average occupancy of an ICU bed at Fortis has now gone up to 14 days.At Peerless Hospital, there has been a sharp spurt in the ICU occupancy period — from 7 days to 12 days — since the second week of July. “We have noticed a jump in critical cases since July 10. These patients have severe co-morbidities and are recovering slowly, increasing the bed occupancy period. It has led to a resource crunch, since longer occupancy means ventilators, oxygen and other support are occupied for a longer period. More critical patients and longer bed occupancy not only mean a lower recovery rate, but also denial of ICU care to moderate patients who deteriorate and need critical care,” said Peerless CEO Sudipto Mitra.Onco-surgeon Saurav Dutta agreed. “With the spiralling numbers, this was waiting to happen,” he said. “We now have a greater number of complicated cases and recovery time is obviously longer for them. There is a limit to which ICU beds can be added, and the problem won’t be solved merely by reducing the treatment time of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients.”At hospitals like RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) and AMRI, the ICU stay period has not lengthened, but it’s been around 14-15 days. “Our ICU occupancy rate has doubled, and has remained 100% for weeks,” said RTIICS zonal director R Venkatesh.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77188958,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-138322,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/longer-icu-stays-keep-critical-care-out-of-reach-for-many-in-kol/articleshow/77188239.cms

The campaign, “Shoja Banglay Bolchi” (speaking in straightforward Bengali), will be a thrice-weekly video series anchored by TMC’s Rajya Sabha party leader Derek O’Brien. “One-minute video clips will be released at 11 am every Sunday, Wednesday and Friday. The series is expected to run for the next few months on social media ,” TMC said in a statement. The videos will highlight issues pertinent in the present social, political and economic framework, it said.

“The videos will also focus on how Bengal, under Mamata Banerjee’s leadership, has made phenomenal progress in the last nine years across parameters. Other subjects include how federalism has eroded and how states have been deprived,” TMC added.

According to TMC sources, this social media campaign will be used to counter BJP ’s allegations about “fake news and rhetoric against the state government and the party”.

The mother was then undergoing treatment at Paras hospital, a private and dedicated Covid hospital in the city’s Dhurwa area.Talking to TOI, Dr Kiran Das, the in-charge of neonatal care at Rims, said, “As a precautionary step, we decided to conduct a Covid-19 test on the baby.”Das added, “The boy was suffering from physiological jaundice, which is normal for newborns. But after his Covid report returned positive, we decided to admit him to the Covid-19 neonatal nursery.”Rims’s Covid nursery has six beds, Das said and highlighted that the baby boy was the first to be admitted at the facility. On the line of his treatment, the doctor said, “Since his weight wasn’t a concern, we only ensured basic nursing and he was fed at regular intervals. On June 24, we went for another confirmatory test on an RT-PCR machine and the report was negative.”The child was finally discharged from Rims on Friday. Das claimed that this was the first case at Rims where a baby born to a Covid-positive mother also tested positive to the virus.“This is probably also the first case of its kind in the state.

CHENNAI: Lockdown with relaxations, currently in force across Tamil Nadu, is likely to continue until August-end. While further relaxations could be considered, when chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami holds discussions with district collectors on Wednesday, the ban on public transport as well as malls and cinema halls will remain in force, official sources said.

“With Covid positive numbers growing in the districts, the lockdown is likely to be continued beyond July 31, when the present lockdown comes to an end. Some more relaxations could be considered, but controls over public places and public transport will remain till at least next month,” said a state government official.

On Monday, the chief minister will launch commercial operations of 11 industrial projects, for which MoUs were signed in GIM 2015 and 2019, and lay foundation stones for eight other projects. The projects include TPI Composites, an American company planning to manufacture blades for wind mills and a 2.2 million sqft IT park by Capitaland (formerly Ascendas) on Pallavaram – Thoraipakkam Radial Road, besides a manufacturing unit established by Gulf Oil, official sources said.

473,['27/07/2020'],"Physical courts won’t open for at least 2 weeks, says SC registry","NEW DELHI: Nearly a million lawyers, facing an unprecedented financial crisis due to restricted functioning of the judiciary for over four months, will have to wait for another two weeks to know the roadmap for gradual opening of courts for physical hearing even though virtual courts will remain in place for months to come.

A committee of judges comprising Justices NV Ramana, Arun Mishra , RF Nariman, UU Lalit, AM Khanwilkar, DY Chandrachud and LN Rao had a detailed interaction with medical experts as soon as the daily number of Covid patients showed a slight dip in Delhi.

“The unanimous medical opinion was that while there is a marginal dip in cases in the past few days, the status quo (regarding keeping the courts shut) needs to be maintained at least for a period of two weeks,” the SC registry said.

The panel sympathised with the lawyers facing hardship but felt that opening the court would make courts super spreaders of Covid. It decided not to open courts at this stageand said it would review the situation after two weeks. It said inputs from all SC advocate bodies and BCI will be taken into consideration.

Together, the four districts accounted for 35% of the new cases with 2,499 people testing positive.In Chennai, fewer cases were reported in old contamination zones and despite cases being reported from new areas, the daily case curve has not spiked for over a week now.However, in other districts,cases areincreasing.Virudhunagar, which has reported a high number of in the past five days, registered 385 new cases on Sunday.

475,['27/07/2020'],"Pandemic has worsened woes of disabled women, says study","NEW DELHI: A survivor of domestic violence, a 42 – year – old woman with a locomotor disability who lives in Thane in Maharashtra was forced to return to her marital home with her 5 - year - old daughter in the middle of the lockdown when her paternal family said they could no longer support her physically and financially.Separated from her husband and dependent on her brothers for physical assistance and financial support, she returned to her marital home using a set of keys she still had as her husband no longer lives there. He has also filed a divorce case in court. She is now living alone, is unable to pay the house rent and her daughter’s school fee while she is trying to survive with the little money she has in her savings and a nominal support of about Rs 5000 that her husband sends sometimes for house expenses.This case study is part of a report ""Neglected and Forgotten: Women with disabilities during the Covid crisis in India"", that highlights that in case of women with disabilities, domestic violence is not just about physical and emotional abuse but also about abandonment, deprivation from assistive devices, medicines and much needed essentials to get through the daily routine. It is also highlighted that the on ground response mechanism for domestic violence including the domestic violence law and helplines are ill-equipped to address these concerns.That the pandemic has only aggravated the problem for women with disabilities comes through in case studies like this one from Bihar where a family was found to be experiencing a cycle of abuse because of loss of employment and access to food. “In a household both husband and wife are disabled, the husband lost his job. They are unable to afford basic things like milk for their children. With growing frustration, he is beating his wife, and his wife is beating their children,” it is stated.In May 2020, between the lockdown phase 3 and 4, civil society organisations - "" Rising Flame "" and "" Sightsavers India "" undertook a study focusing on the experiences and situation of women with disabilities in the COVID-19 pandemic in India. The research is based on the experiences and feedback of 82 women with disabilities besides 12 experts across 19 states and nine self-identified disability groups. While the report looks at a range of issues like access to essentials, accessibility, livelihood, education, health and social protection, it also dedicates a chapter to domestic violence.In one case study, a 24-year-old postgraduate student from Mahasamund district, Chhattisgarh living with locomotor disability is quoted in the study where she tells that her friend – another disabled woman - living nearby, was forced to cook food for her entire family with the threat of neglect and withholding basic amenities if she did not do so.Summing up the various concerns, a deaf woman from Delhi raises a critical concern through this report. “We do not have a streamlined process on how to reach out for help and subsequent steps. Where will the women take shelter? What strategy to follow? No woman will risk their safety by making a call if there is no follow up,” she is quoted.Earlier in May, National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People in a report on the challenges faced by persons with disabilities (PwDs) cited the case study of how a family abandoned a 49 - year old - deaf person at AIIMS-Raipur in Chhattisgarh after admitting him as a Covid-19 suspect on March 29. The same report highlighted a case from Kolkata where a 78-year-old man allegedly killed his 45-year-old disabled son in a quarrel over wearing a mask. These case studies were drawn from media reports.NCPEDP had cautioned that instances of abuse and attacks on persons with disabilities tend to go up in times of great stress. It was shared that in a series of TikTok videos shared among millions across the country, people were shown pretending to be disabled in order to deceive the authorities during lock down.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pandemic-has-worsened-woes-of-disabled-women-says-study/articleshow/77188644.cms

CHENNAI: With the state government promoting all college students to the next academic year without exams in view of Covid-19, the previous academic year (2019-20) has ended. And city colleges are chalking out plans to begin the new session.

After finding out that a majority of students have access to digital devices with internet, colleges are drawing up a time-table for online classes.

Online classes will be made available on YouTube and other platforms so that students can access it later if they cannot stream live classes or have doubts.

“We could not start the next academic year without knowing whether there will be exams or not. It has given clarity. Now, students also will be motivated to attend online classes for next semester,” said B Chidambararajan, principal of Valliammai Engineering College. Its online classes will begin on August 10.

“We have conducted a trial run. Students need 700MB data for two to three hours of online classes,” he said. Students also gave feedback flagging poor connection and frequent disconnection.

Some colleges have trained its faculty to take online classes. “We are planning to conduct four-hour classes per day -- two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening,” said R M Kishore, vice-chairman of RMK Engineering College.

Arts and science colleges in the city are planning to take online classes. Madras Christian College (MCC) is mulling classes with flexible timings. “We plan to conduct online classes from the first week of August,” said P Wilson, MCC principal. Wilson said 93% of students have access to digital devices. “We could not reach 5% of our students due to connectivity issues,” he said.

Guru Nanak College grouped students based on their schools and prepared a common time-table.

“The online classes will begin from Monday. We are planning to conduct classes in the morning and webinar in the afternoon,” said M G Ragunathan, principal.

The college has conducted remedial classes online for students. “The attendance is better than offline classes. During a survey, we found 98% of our students have access to gadgets with the internet,” he said.

All other wards have at least 50 ongoing cases, with areas in Bengaluru South zone particularly hard hit. One of every four positive cases recorded in the city in the past 10 days was from the South zone.The seven wards that have bucked the trend are: Bilekahalli, T-Dasarahalli, Subramanya Nagar, Nayandahalli, Devarajeevanahalli, Lakshmidevi Nagar and Kuvempu Nagar.“The surprising thing about these seven wards is that 60 per cent of their population is what can be described as urban poor. People here maintain social distancing, wear a mask in public and follow other safety rules,” said a senior surveillance officer of BBMP . “There are fewer trade establishments and markets in these localities, so the movement of interstate travellers has been low.”BBMP suspects that an influx of interstate travellers partly caused the surge in Covid-19 cases in Bengaluru, though there is no definitive data on this. A senior officer from Bengaluru East zone said that localities in the said seven wards accounted for only 3 per cent of interstate and international travellers who arrived in the city following the outbreak. Locals have been largely shielded, he added.Bengaluru South zone has become a major worry for health officials as all the wards here have 50 or more active Covid-19 cases. The zone, in fact, has reported over a quarter of the city’s positive cases in the past 10 days. It includes certain parts of central business district, where traders rely on supplies from other states.“Kamakshipalya, Bapujinagar, Adugodi and SG Palya have trade establishments that depend on Maharashtra, West Bengal, Rajasthan and other states for supplies. The cases are very high in these areas. Some employees of these establishments also travel to other states and this could be a reason behind the spread of the virus,” said a senior BBMP official.An epidemiologist with BBMP said the source of infection in most of the cases in the South zone was not known. “There appears to be a local transmission. The easing of the lockdown was a clear trigger,” the epidemiologist said. Many international travellers tested positive in the area. Several traders and other citizens are asymptomatic, according to a senior IAS officer. Every day, nearly 2,700 rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests are conducted in the region. “We have increased testing because fighting the outbreak in the South zone is crucial to bringing down the city’s caseload. About 26 per cent of the city’s positive cases in the past 10 days were from this zone and it’s worrisome,” said Veerabhadra Swamy, BBMP joint commissioner (south).",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77192767,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-837950,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/barring-7-all-bengaluru-wards-have-50-or-more-active-cases/articleshow/77188671.cms

BENGALURU: With schools shut since early March and online classes sporadic at best, educationists have expressed fears that there could be a huge learning gap and suggested curated reopening of the institutions so that children could return to substantive schooling experience.

The expert committee formed by the Karnataka government to look into online classes for children made a bouquet of suggestions — TV, radio, online, community schooling and sending worksheets home. The government has started TV classes only for the high school section yet.

Rishikesh BS, associate professor with Azim Premji University, quoting researches, said school students in the US have fallen behind their expected learning levels due to the virus disruptions. In the Indian context, he suggested that the decision of reopening of schools should be made at village or taluk level — “certainly not from Bengaluru” — depending on parameters like the risk of infection, levels of interaction and open spaces available .

Experts suggest curated reopening of institutions

‘Long gaps in learning could be disastrous’

He said, “Thousands of schools in interiors of Karnataka are within protective bubbles, which are safe. In such areas, a curated opening with batches and for a few days of the week could be made.”

According to VP Niranjanaradhya, centre for child and law, National Law School of India University, there are reports of children dropping out of schools and accompanying parents to work as labourers. “If we do not start some sort of a mechanism now, then we’ll pay a heavy price,” he added. He, too, said that each school should be given the autonomy to identify the means (online classes or staggered reopening) best suited to them. “This can start with rural schools untouched by the pandemic who can opt for some of the measures suggested by the government committee,” he added.

If the rhythm is lost, getting these children back to classes is a challenge, agreed Ashvini Ranjan, managing trustee, Pratham Mysore. “We are preparing a programme to involve the whole family to help engage the child in studies that can be shared through WhatsApp. An NGO has limitations. It’s up to the government to come up with a wholesome plan,” he said. Long gaps in learning could be disastrous. Rishikesh of Azim Premji University explained: “A McKinsey study states the hurt due to the learning loss could last a lifetime. It’s proven that the negative impact is greatest for the disadvantaged communities. Scholars at Brown, Harvard and Virginia University suggest that the drop in learning gains could be as high as a third of the expected scores in reading and more than half of the expected progress in Math.”

Ravi Narayan Chakrakodi, professor, Regional Institute of English, said teachers should make learning material accessible to children wherever they are, design interesting tasks that enable learning on one’s own, through peer and parental support and monitor their performance remotely. “They must plan creative ways of engaging students to ensure learning continues,” he said.

CHENNAI: While the entire corporation machinery has been grinding away on Covid-19 duty, the top brass has instructed the health department to also take up dengue awareness campaigns as rainy season is about to set in. Commissioner G Prakash has instructed the officials to ensure that the workers also advise public to keep their household surroundings clean and not allow water to stagnate anywhere, while visiting homes during their door to door survey.

Last year, the city was divided into 3,000 blocks and a domestic breeding checker was allotted to survey 500 houses in a week to check for backyards and terraces for unused tyres, open water drums.

However since, the malaria workers along with temporary volunteers are on covid-19 duty, additional responsibility is given as dengue too starts with similar symptoms, officials said. Civic body officials are however confident of greater care as fever camps are being operated in all zones in the city and focus volunteers are surveying households for symptoms every day.

Officials said that special focus will be given to Government hospitals and government offices, which are right now the most active workspaces in the city.

Apart from hospitals and residences, focus will also be on vacant plots. Ward teams have been instructed to first issue notices to owners of vacant lands, if not maintained properly and take a survey of vacant lands in each zone and submit to the headquarters. Last year, the civic body had identified over 24,000 vacant plots in the city. Sanitary officers will be the overseeing authority, which will be reviewed by zonal health officers,” said a senior officer with Greater Chennai Corporation.

Greater Chennai Corporation has also directed its ground teams to do focused fogging to eradicate dengue spreading Aedes mosquitos in slum areas.

This means even engineers who have retired from service will be held liable and have to cough up fines ranging from Rs 10,000 and above depending on the number of offences.Asked if BDAhas powers to issue show-cause notice and collect fines from even those who have retired from service, the commissioner said: “There are provisions to collect fine from them as well.”Yet another reason for holding officials accountable is to ensure if the government decision to regularise illegal constructions is challenged in court, then the state has proof of action initiated against officials, who allowed them to happen in the first place.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77188720,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-634471,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bangalore-development-authority-to-penalise-officials-who-allowed-illegal-constructions/articleshow/77188697.cms

Based on the lawsuit — filed after India banned 59 Chinese apps on June 29 in the wake of the military faceoff with China in Ladakh — the court has issued summons to Alibaba, Jack Ma and 13 others named by petitioner Pushpandra SinghParmar.UCWeb runs the UC Browser.

Among instances of fake news the plea mentions are a report on a ban on Rs 2,000 notes published a year after demonetisation in 2017, one on a communal attack during Gujarat assembly polls the same year and another, later, on India and Pakistan going to war. Other instances cited include fake news about PM Modi and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.

The summons were issued on July 20, the same day Parmar filed his petition in the court of civil judge Sonia Sheokhand , who directed the respondents to appear in person or through a lawyer on July 27. The basis of Parmar’s petition is his termination from the company in 2017, which he alleges was illegal and a consequence of him bringing these issues up with the senior management.

The case is significant as the allegations highlight the perception that Chinese businesses are linked to the state machinery and used to extract data from other countries and are part of an information war directed by Beijing.

In an article published on July 23, investigative newspaper Klaxon said China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology has signed a covert three-year deal with Pakistan military’s Defense Science and Technology Organization to collaborate research in “emerging infectious diseases”.

Pakistan’s foreign office (FO), on Sunday, described the article as a “politically motivated and fake story” and said it was composed of “distortion of facts and fabrications that quote anonymous sources”. “There is nothing secret about the Bio-Safety Level-3 (BSL-3) Laboratory of Pakistan referred to in the report. Pakistan has been sharing information about the facility with the States Parties to the Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention (BTWC) in its submission of Confidence Building Measures,” the FO said.

Quoting anonymous intelligence sources, Klaxon said the China-funded project has conducted “successful soil sampling tests” to isolate Bacillus Thuringiensis , which has a “striking similarity” to Bacillus Anthracis — or anthrax, a classified bio-warfare agent. “Considering the striking similarity between BT and Bacillus Anthracis, (Pakistan’s) improved know-how in handling the bacteria could enrich a potential offensive biological programme,” one source said. The Wuhan lab was providing “extensive training on manipulation of pathogens and bio-informatics” to Pakistani scientists “to help Pakistan develop its own virus collection database”, the report said.

“This could help Pakistan enhance its capability of genetic identification of viruses, access to dangerous microorganisms, and use of genomic tools for research and infectious diseases,” an intelligence source said.

But only one-third of it is handled at the Manali incineration plant. The rest is either burnt or buried in unused burial grounds.TOI has also reported instances of it being dumped in roadside bins. The Manali plant can treat only 5 tonnes a day and is shut down every fifth day for maintenance.Every day, conservancy workers wearing PPE kits and collect bio-medical waste from Covid positive houses and take it to the ward office. If the collection is more than 500kg, it is sent to the Manali plant. Otherwise, the waste is buried locally in a deep pit, said a corporation official.The waste generated from Covid care centres, urban primary health care centres and hospitals is collected by two contractors listed by the Central Pollution Control Board. “Last week, we signed the contract with two companies that will be responsible for collection and disposal of the medical waste. We will pay them based on the quantity collected,” said Vijula, executive engineer, solid waste management department.But what about the biomedical waste from non-Covid households? The rules say the municipal corporation should set up a treatment facility. Or it should tie up with companies with expertise in disposal. Under no circumstances can this waste be mixed with other solid waste.In the city, bio-medical waste from non-Covid homes is collected unsegregated and dumped at Perungudi or Kodungaiyur. G Veerappan, superintendent engineer for solid waste management, said, they cannot ask the workers to segregate the waste as there is risk of infection. “If residents give it separately, workers will collect it and send it to the incineration plant.

495,['27/07/2020'],Chennai: Is Sunday curfew helping us? Not everyone is sure,"A pigeon makes the most of the deserted Royapuram flyover during the complete lockdown on Sunday

CHENNAI: Chennai has enforced complete lockdown on Sunday for a while now but experts and doctors stand divided on whether one-day lockdown will help the government in controlling the spread of Covid-19.

While some said that there was no clear evidence so far that it has reduced transmission as markets and shops remain overcrowded every Saturday,, others said that poor implementation of a lockdown can’t be a reason to undermine its effectiveness.

Some even say that excess crowding on Saturdays could accelerate Covid-19 transmission rate and might see Chennai achieve herd immunity soon.

Any lockdown has two effects. First it slows down the epidemic and then the time towards reaching herd immunity. But in this case where there is a heavy rush in markets the day before, it might facilitate faster transmission. According to Jayaprakash Muliyil, Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the National Institute of Epidemiology, it can be interpreted either way.

“Anyway, Chennai is fast approaching the herd level that I have mentioned in the past as old containment zones were reporting lesser cases and cases are picking up in new areas. These two phenomena put together you still have a flat line (infection curve),” the epidemiologist added. Official Data says that Chennai has reported about 1,100-1,300 new cases everyday last week.

Public health expert P Kuganantham, who is a member of the governmentappointed expert medical committee, however asserted that Sunday lockdowns have helped in breaking the transmission chain and has reduced disease spread in Chennai.

Though shops were crowded on Saturdays, it would have been the case on any other day too. But Sundays were chosen because public movement was much higher in the city on this day (particularly at meat shops and markets) compared to any other day in the week, he added.

Private hospital doctors said that an epidemic usually is supposed to reduce in about 100 days but lockdowns have prolonged it and if there are enough beds in hospitals the idea should be to reduce the duration of the epidemic.

AM Vikramaraja, president, Federation of Tamil Nadu Traders’ Association said that neighbouring states like Karnataka have declared that lockdown was not the solution and TN by enforcing such restrictions on Sundays was only making things worse.

“Just like few markets in Delhi which are allowed to operate 24/7, Tamil Nadu too should increase working hours to reduce crowd. Markets can even work in three shifts. By this, police and corporation officials can ensure that everybody wore masks and maintained social distancing,” he added.

496,['27/07/2020'],Tropical Depression Hanna drenches Texas amid virus crisis,"CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas: A day after roaring ashore as a hurricane, Hanna lashed the Texas Gulf Coast on Sunday with high winds and drenching rains that destroyed boats, flooded streets and knocked out power across a region already reeling from a surge in coronavirus cases.Downgraded to a tropical depression, Hanna passed over the U.S.-Mexico border with winds near 50 mph (85 kph), the National Hurricane Center said. It unloaded more than 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain on parts of South Texas and northeastern Mexico.Border communities whose health care systems were already strained by COVID-19 cases _ with some patients being airlifted to larger cities _ found themselves under siege from the first hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic season. There were no immediate reports of any deaths on either side of the border.Dr. Ivan Melendez, the health authority in Hidalgo County, Texas, was treating a patient overnight at a hospital when he and a nurse noticed water streaming down a wall and pooling on the floor. The water was flowing through a vent in the room, which had been retrofitted with a fan to create negative pressure and prevent the virus spreading through the hospital.After driving home in the storm in the middle of the night, Melendez was trapped Sunday morning in his home by downed trees and had no electricity. He used the phone to discuss whether to put a 58-year-old woman on a ventilator, a decision he felt uncomfortable making without seeing the patient in person.``You look at the people's eyes,'' he said. ``You'll know if they're in despair.''Another doctor decided to place the woman on the ventilator, he said later.Henry Van De Putte, CEO of the Red Cross' Texas Gulf Coast chapter, said the organization would open more shelters with reduced capacity to ensure social distancing. Volunteers and people seeking refuge will undergo temperature checks, and a medical professional will be assigned to each location, he said.A community building known as the ``Dome'' in Mercedes, Texas, was set aside for evacuees who had tested positive for COVID-19 or were exposed to the virus. Across the region, shelters were also opened in hotels, schools and gyms.Van De Putte emphasized that people should not delay seeking help because of the virus.``Yes, coronavirus provides risk, but so does floodwater, so does not having electricity, so does not having required medications,'' he said. ``We're doing everything we can do possible to make it a safe environment.''In the Mexican border city of Reynosa, a maternity hospital was damaged by heavy rain, and water had to be pumped out, authorities said. Some patients had to be moved to upper floors, and a few were evacuated to other hospitals, said Pedro Granados, director of civil protection for Tamaulipas state.Coastal states scrambled this spring to adjust emergency hurricane plans to account for the virus, and Hanna was the first big test. Gov. Greg Abbott said Saturday that some people in need of shelter would be given hotel rooms to keep them apart from others.Abbott announced Sunday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency approved an emergency declaration that will provide federal aid.Hanna blew ashore as a Category 1 storm late Saturday afternoon with winds of 90 mph (145 kph) not far from Port Mansfield, which is about 130 miles (210 kilometers) south of Corpus Christi.Myrle Tucker, 83, tried to ride out the storm in a powerboat docked in a Corpus Christi marina. But winds and rain blew out the vessel's windows. Eventually rescuers in a dinghy were able to reach him and bring him to shore. Many other boats were flooded and lashed by the storm.Tucker said he told his rescuers he wasn't sure he would be able to climb out of his boat.``They picked me up,'' he said. ``They carried me like a box of napkins.''More than 150,000 customers lost power Sunday throughout South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Brownsville, utility officials said.Corpus Christi is in Nueces County, where 60 babies tested positive for Covid-19 from July 1 to July 16. Farther south in Cameron County, more than 300 new cases have been reported almost daily for the past two weeks. The past week has also been the county's deadliest of the pandemic.Hanna came nearly three years after Hurricane Harvey blew ashore northeast of Corpus Christi. Hanna was not expected to be as destructive as Harvey, which killed 68 people and caused an estimated $125 billion in damage in Texas.In the Mexican city of Matamoros, across from Brownsville, the rains shook tents in a refugee camp housing an estimated 1,300 asylum seekers, including newborns and elderly people, who have been waiting for months for court dates under a U.S. immigration policy informally known as ``Remain in Mexico.''In the Pacific Ocean , meanwhile, Hurricane Douglas closed in on Hawaii over the weekend.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-77188734,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-145305,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/tropical-depression-hanna-drenches-texas-amid-virus-crisis/articleshow/77188747.cms
