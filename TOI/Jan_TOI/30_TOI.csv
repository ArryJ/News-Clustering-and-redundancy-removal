Modern-day families are increasingly becoming an environmentally conscious and health conscious lot. It is, therefore, no surprise that organically grown vegetables are fast replacing the flower pots in balconies and terrace gardens. Taking a step forward, city dwellers are now adopting hydroponics — the method of growing plants without soil. Although clean eating caught the fancy of people a few years ago, this subset of hydroculture is a relatively new practice that’s finding prominence in neighbourhoods across India.Hydroponics is a subset of hydroculture, which is a method of growing plants without soil by using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent instead. “Only certain plants can naturally grow in water. We dissolve nutrients in water and then attach a pump that allows this water to rotate throughout the system,” says Vinod Chakravarti, co-founder of a company that deals with hydroponics.With water scarcity and a lack of space counted among issues faced by people, the method of hydroponics comes in handy for those keen on growing their own vegetables at home. Bengaluru-based Patanjali Bhat, says, “Hydroponics is easier to follow, and yields superior quality greens that are way better than the ones in the market. My intention was to provide my family fresh and chemical-free greens. We set up the arrangement on the the terrace of our house. This method worked better for us, as we do not have regular water supply in our house. Hydroponics helped me save up to 70% of water.” Laasya Samhita, a Bengaluru-based biologist, adds that hydroponics works for people who love gardening, but do not have the space for it. “I used to struggle to find good-quality greens in the market, and even if I did, they would always be sprayed with pesticides. I love gardening, but have no space. With hydroponics, I grow my own greens, and save water now,” says Laasya, adding that greens like Amaranth grow well in Bengaluru.Experts say that while the no-soil farming trend has gained momentum in recent times, people are experimenting with various greens and plants. “Hydroponics is on the rise in India, as there is more awareness now, thanks to social media. We get orders from across the country. We have worked with nearly 300 homes in Hyderabad alone in the past one year, and the numbers are increasing. The set-up we have is uniform across the country. However, in places like Jaipur, where the temperature can get really high like during summer, people won’t be able to do much,” says Vihari Kanukollu, CEO of a vertical urban farming company in Hyderabad.According to Atrei Chatterjee, who runs a restaurant in Kolkata, this method has worked wonders for him. “I am able to use fresh supplies of greens from my home. I have grown lettuce, and now I’m looking at growing herbs, tomatoes and other leafy greens. The only challenge I faced initially was in controlling the light conditions, but once I got the hang of it, it became easy. In Kolkata, one can grow greens throughout the year. There are a variety of easy-to grow spinach varieties,” he explains.Divith Savarkar, an urban farmer who works at a corporate office in Bengaluru, says, “Our office was on the look-out to support green initiatives when we chanced upon hydroponics. We installed this structure at our workplace as well, and currently, we have a variety of lettuces and spinaches growing within our office premises.” Instead of having ornamental plants, offices can grow greens and other vegetables, he explains, adding, “If we have more such arrangements in place at offices, employees too tend to become curious. A lot of our employees have also adopted the technique to grow their own vegetables at home.”With no soil requirement, one need not worry about how porous the soil has to be for the roots of the plant. Seeds are initially grown in a porous medium like cocopeat.The yield in a hydroponics set up is faster. Growth from seed to saplings takes about three weeks, and for a sapling to produce takes 2-3 weeks.Since plants are grown right at home, one need not spray the plant with any form of chemical pesticide. Organic ones will do.Unlike traditional farming, this method saves water as the water is continuously circulated throughout the setup.Once the produce is harvested, the continuous rotation of nutrients in the water ensures that the next cycle of growth and harvest too takes place faster.The initial cost of setting up pumps and connecting the plants in your space is on the higher side.While this can be set up as part of the initial investment, it is necessary to create a glass house effect with various materials to avoid harsh and direct sunlight on plants.It is not practical to practice hydroponics in places like Chennai and Jaipur, where the temperature can get really high during summer.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73730446,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-438093/73730446.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/urban-farmers-are-exploring-the-art-of-growing-plants-with-no-soil-less-water/articleshow/73730446.cms
1,['30/01/2020'],Fountain pen sales on the rise in Kolkata,"This story is from January 30, 2020

In Kolkata, often called the cultural capital of the country, there are many who vouch by the fountain pen. For instance, Sucharita Sen, a resident of Bagha Jatin who works in an MNC in Salt Lake told us that it was mandatory to use fountain pens till Class VIII in her school. “I never gave up the habit and took all my exams using fountain pens throughout my life. Even now, when almost everything is digital, I carry fountain pens and often use them. I even signed my marriage certificate with an old fountain pen , which my parents also used when they got married.”

Academician Bratati Bhattacharyya added, “A fountain pen also helps a child develop motor skills as it has a specific weight and needs to move in a certain direction to write. Fountain pens with high-quality nibs allow children to hold the pen in the correct position, which helps with stability and a good grip.”

Sales on the rise

At College Street and Gariahat, the the common verdict is that the fountain pens have definitely made a comeback and sales are on the rise. And according to the vendors, students prefer fountain pens that come with a piston-filling mechanism. “Though the mechanism is pretty old-school, many opt for it nowadays since it doesn’t stain your fingers,” said Hamid, a manager of a pen shop in a city mall that sells high-end pens. Added Swarup Kumar Adhya of a stationery store on College Street, “It’s good to see that many youngsters are buying fountain pens now. The pen varieties, which were popular in the ’70s and ’80s are making a comeback and sales have increased 50 to 60 times since 2016.”

‘I still use a fountain pen’

I love using fountain pens. I have one that I still use to write almost everything. I used to collect stamps, coins and

pens, including fountain pens.

‘I’m more creative with fountain pens’

I only write with fountain pens — be it a script or anything else. I think my creative juices flow better when I write with a fountain pen. I love how it stains my fingers. I also love collecting fountain pens.

It was the sports movie, Clap , that was being shot and in keeping with the story, athletic tracks had been recreated in a ground in Tondiarpet.The banners that had been put up, the flex hoardings, and the typical arrangements found at a running track, the officials roaming around there, runners — all of them were shooting for Clap, being directed by Prithivi Adithya, starring Aadhi in the lead.According to Prithivi, the bilingual (Tamil and Telugu) sports movie revolves around 400m sprint. “We have been shooting here for a week,” begins the director, adding, “We are filming a state athletics meet here.”“Aadhi’s character trains a young Bhagyalakshmi (Krisha Kurup). To bring in the authenticity, we have roped in real officials officiating at a real ground and have chosen proper equipment. For the national meet, we are planning to go for a ground in Kerala, Vizag or Bangalore. The officials were surprised at our efforts to bring in an authentic ambience of a running event. A lot of research has been done in terms of shaping the ground, putting up the boards, costumes, and so on,” Prithivi explains.Currently, I’m shooting for my portion as a sports coach. This is one of the crucial sequences in the film, which appears in the latter half. While these scenes do not require me to be very fit, I will also be shown as a sprinter in the film, and for that I will have to train vigorously for almost two months to look like an athlete. To perfect my portions, I have been learning terminologies associated with the sport. It is a pleasure to learn the nuances behind the athletes’ nature, their timing, reflexes, and so on. It’s been a while since I have gone for a makeover and this film has finally given me that opportunity.— Aadhi, actorI play Bhagyalakshmi, an athlete in the movie. This particular scene is about the challenge I face and my equation with my trainer. To tell the story of anybody who represents the country in any sport is a big deal. The film is very close to my heart and I am enjoying the experience. I have done a lot of homework — I took training for three months to look like an athlete. I lost 11kg in a short span. An athlete’s energy is spent during the moments when he/she runs on the ground. I started learning a lot about athletes — the way they sit, their behaviour, everything.— Krisha Kurup, actressI play a sports journalist in this movie. At the moment, we’re shooting an emotional scene between an athlete and her coach. Another emotional track runs between the coach and the female lead of the film, who is a hockey player. Ilaiyaraaja sir loved the script and he has given us three extraordinary songs already. He is getting ready with another one now, for montage. We had shot a few portions in Ramojirao Film City. A flashback portion is to be shot later in a college stadium in the city. Till recently, we had many scenes that required the presence of huge crowds. Those were shot in a multiple-cameras set-up.- Karthik, actor-producerWe have extensively used different cameras and multiple-camera set-ups to capture the running race sequences. A sports movie requires to be very believable, and for the same, it is necessary to present movements in the most credible manner. I have worked in sports documentaries before and it came in handy. We have used wide lens for many crucial scenes to create maximum impact on screen. Though we were lucky to have a favourable climate throughout our schedule, the mud track was complicated. We had to depend on Gyro Stabilized Heads, which we brought in from Hyderabad.- Praveen Kumar, cinematographer",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73732881,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1158157/73732881.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/shoot-at-site-clap-a-sports-drama-with-emotions-thrown-in/articleshow/73732881.cms

Bengaluru, too, seems to be in panic mode, with three suspected cases already being registered at the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases.Some 3,275 passengers were recently screened at the Kempegowda International Airport Bengaluru. Also in the city, the total number of people quarantined at their homes is six, while the number of people under observation in hospitals is four, as per information from the Health Department as of January 28.Health experts are urging people not to be anxious and adopt preventive measures, instead. “CoV is a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The novel coronavirus, however, is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. These viruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and human beings,” says Dr KK Aggarwal, President of the Heart Care Foundation of India (HCFI).According to World Health Organisation, patients who are diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection are showing a number of symptoms. Most of them seem to have a mild version of the disease, but about 20% of them appear to be progressing to the severe phase — which includes pneumonia, respiratory failure and even death. “In case of virus infections, it is important to strictly follow all preventive measures, which involves maintaining proper hand hygiene, covering mouth while coughing and sneezing and avoiding close contact with people who have a cold or flu-like symptoms. People also need to ensure that they have thoroughly cooked meat and eggs,” advises Dr Ambanna Gowda, a city-based internal medicine consultant.Experts have also advised not to pay much attention to WhatsApp forwards that are currently making the rounds. “People need to stop forwarding unauthenticated messages about Coronavirus on their phones.

She charms her audience with her effervescence and the camaraderie she shares with them. This has made her one of the most sought-after hosts on the small screen. She’s dabbled in movies, has done several popular short films and web series, and even played one of the leads in Lakshmi Stores. Meet Nakshathra Nagesh , the Chennai Times Most Desirable Woman On Television 2019 . In a no-holds-barred chat with us, the youngster tells us why she loves being in front of the camera, how she handles all the fan attention and of course, her relationship mantra.Excerpts:When I learnt about it, I felt it was all a dream. I immediately called my brother to tell him about it. He was like, ‘Wait, what? Are you serious?’. I was not even sure I heard it right. Many people have been featured on the list and to make it to the number one slot feels so unreal. But now that I know it’s true, I think it’s very flattering.I feel people who work in the television industry are really fortunate. The kind of recognition they get for their work is huge. People identify us as one amongst themselves. ‘She is our girl’… that’s the kind of vibe they get. If an elderly woman approaches me, it’s because she looks at me like her daughter. That’s the kind of connection we have with our audience. They don’t look at us as just celebrities. Once, I was with my friends at Times Square, New York, and this family came to me and said, ‘Neenga Nakshathra dhaane?’. My friends were like, ‘This is crazy man, people are recognising you in New York!’. That, for me, was very overwhelming.I am in love – with my job. All my focus is on work. At the risk of sounding cheesy, I’ll say I’m happily taken, by my job. (laughs)If you are witty, you’ll get me. You can floor me with your brilliance. I am not into looks all that much, it’s the brain that I’m after.Dishonesty. I don’t like it if you lie even for the simplest thing. For instance, instead of saying what I’m wearing is not okay, you sugar-coat it and say it’s great to just please me, I’d not like it. Every relationship should be founded on honesty and genuineness.A rumour that I was married to a co-host, but my co-host was single. There was this website that had carried an article on how I secretly married Dhilip Rayan, and if you clicked on the hyperlink on his name, another article said how he was the most eligible bachelor in town. If you are anyway coming out with rumours, you might as well make sense!I’m the tenth in line to the throne of England (laughs).There’s a misconception that attitude is a bad thing to have. It’s not an insult or derogatory to say that you have an attitude. It could be good attitude or bad attitude, but you need to have an attitude. It’s your ideals and principles, and I don’t think you should let the world change that. So, you have to be very, very strong in what you think is right or wrong. Also, I feel that everybody needs to have work-life balance. It’s a little more for women because as much as we need our family to support us through our career, we also have to be there for our loved ones. As long as we get these things right, we are going to go places.I love to work. If I get an opportunity to either host or act 365 days a year, I would do it with all my heart. It gives me immense pleasure to be in front of the camera. So many people have asked me what I like doing the most— anchoring or acting. To be honest, I can’t choose between the two because I’m passionate about both. I love being on screen and work can never tire me. I’m very inquisitive and whenever I shoot, enn directors-ayum cinematographers-ayum kelvi kette konnuduven. I’ve been curious about every aspect of shooting – big screen or small screen.Yes, Vanigan happened out of the blue. It’s a new team and there’s so much passion involved. It’s a make-or-break film for everybody who is involved. It’s motivating that people like Yuvan Shankar Raja arebacking it.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73732750,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-959693/73732750.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/tamil/most-desirable-woman-on-television-2019-nakshathra/articleshow/73732750.cms

A delightful Bharatnatyam dance recital on Chet Singh Ghat last Wednesday evening, attracted a lot of onlookers, including some foreign travellers, who were on a walk on the ghat. Turns out it was part of the shooting of an untitled Telugu film taking place at the ghat. The dancers were soon joined by actress Mishti Chakraborty , who made her debut in Bollywood with the Subhash Ghai directed film Kaanchi, and is the female protagonist of the Telugu film. The actress arrived in a boat and seemed quite charmed by the view of the river front. In between shots, Mishti, who was in a playful mood, played with the stray dogs on the ghat.Students of Banaras Hindu University performing Bharatnatyam (BCCL/ Arvind Kumar)Sharing the experience of shooting in Varanasi, debutant director Sundeep Gopisetty says, “We are here since the last six days and it has been a terrific experience to shoot in the city. We have captured nearly all the ghats in our frames and also went to the outskirts at Chunar waterfalls for the shooting. Apart from Mishti, the film, which is a family drama, also has actor Karthik Raju , known for films like Padesave. We have already shot 60 percent of the film in Hyderabad before coming here. Varanasi figures in the story and is a vital part of the film,” he says.(BCCL/ Arvind Kumar)Misthi Chakraborty and (inset) Ghantasala Viswanath (BCCL/ Arvind Kumar)Misthi Chakraborty and (inset) students of Banaras Hindu University performing Bharatnatyam (BCCL/ Arvind Kumar)",varanasi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73733464,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-395932,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/this-time-a-telugu-film-shoot-in-varanasi/articleshow/73733450.cms

Brushing away

taboo

‘I hope people read the messages and are there for those who need help’

Painting with a meaningful message

There’s a lot being done to create awareness about mental health , today. Corporates are putting this on the top of their agenda, there are a slew of self-help workshops to help people and runners in the recent city marathon also made a point for it. To add to the efforts, last weekend, over 200 Mumbaikars came together outside Mumbai Central Station to paint its walls. Along with giving it vibrant hues, the aim was to stamp out the stigma around mental health.The two-day event began early on Saturday morning. After a briefing, the people present surveyed the walls situated on the road towards the South exit at Mumbai Central station. The volunteers, including passers-by — a mix of individuals of all ages — chose vibrant hues to paint with. Some even went creative on the walls and painted special messages and slogans with a 3-D effect that read: ‘You are not alone’, ‘Your feelings are valid’ and ‘I think they need someone to talk to’.While the underlying theme was to make mental health taboo-free, people also had some fun around it. Says third-year student from Sophia College Zenobia Vaz, “I came across this event on social media and it was about making an important point in public, so I joined in. I feel more people need to know about mental health and not shy away from it. We put across the message through the art and now the writing is there for all to see. I hope people read the messages, understand them and are there for those who need help. I don’t understand why we still feel that if one has a mental illness, it’s like a taboo. The need of the hour is acceptance of mental health issues.”Wadala-based banker Girish Jaggi echoes the thought. “I think an effort like this makes a difference; it’s encouraging and gives a sense of reassurance to others. We should all step out and do our bit for mental health,” he says.Neerja Birla, who founded the idea, added, “Here’s to creating more mind-positive spaces in our communities! Today, mental health has become an alarming issue and needs to be brought out in the open. Art is the perfect medium to help people express thoughts that they are afraid to or do not know how to put into words.”",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73733801,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-57897,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/over-200-mumbaikars-paint-station-wall-in-support-of-mental-health/articleshow/73733801.cms
19,['30/01/2020'],"Chunky Panday: I feel bad for my children, who have not seen that era of zero social pressure","In one of his previous chats with Bombay Times, Chunky Pandey had said that Saif Ali Khan and he play flamboyant characters, pretending to be young men, in Nitin Kakkar’s Jawaani Jaaneman. When we met him recently, and asked him to elaborate on it, he told us that he plays a nightclub owner in London, who is close friends with his regular patron, played by Saif.He added, “We’re playing these sadaa (forever) bachelors, who think it’s best to fly solo and not get tied down. Like young bachelors, we hit on girls. But one night, life turns on its head for Saif’s character — from a single man, he turns into a father and a to-be grandfather! And then, something goes awry with my character, too, which brings the viewer to the understated message of the film — Ours is not the lifestyle one should ideally follow. We’ve shot at a real nightspot in London, but we would shoot during the day, with fake alcohol and junior artistes. It was like being sent to hell to sin away with no chance to sin.”When Chunky played the bad guy Devraj in Saaho, which released a few months ago, he had modelled the character on Javier Bardem (Raoul Silva from Daniel Craig’s Skyfall ). This time around, his brief was to follow the late editor of Playboy, Hugh Hefner . “Of course, this is a Hindi film, so there are no bunnies and toys!” the actor said, laughing. The character took him back to his days as a young man. “Those days, I used to hit the nightclubs and be THE guy on the floor. I’ve lived this character for years in my life. It’s just that this time, I got paid to relive my bachelorhood. I used to be a mastikhor those days. Also, the party scene was crazy and we didn’t have to bother much. Even as actors, we didn’t have anyone following us crazily everywhere. I feel bad for my children, who have not seen that era of zero social pressures and a life away from mobile phones. Life was less complicated.”Coincidentally, it was also during those days that he first met Saif. He recalled, “He was a kid back then, but he has come a long way since then. I love talking to him. He comes from another planet because no one talks like him, and no one has the kind of perspective he has on numerous subjects. I wait to meet him. His point of view is real, but a little different from the usual, laced with his patent dark humour. He has no pretence. He’s a strong actor, secure and effortless; no matter who he is pitted against, his characters flow out of him. He won’t let you feel it, but he’s sharp and switches off instantly after the take. He doesn’t talk big, does what he wants, and lets you do your thing. That’s confidence, which is rare.”The actor, who is known to have hosted some of the most flashy parties in the business for years during the 1990s, has today earned the reputation of being quite a kanjoos, which also forms the butt of jokes on comedy shows. Talking about it, he said, “My New Year bash and birthday parties used to be famous and I still acquired the reputation of being a kanjoos. I think I brought it on myself. It’s said that the best way to lose friends is by loaning them money, and I also lost some of my friends like that. So, this reputation of mine keeps loan-seekers away. However, I still host people lavishly at home or elsewhere.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73731631,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-214676/73731631.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/chunky-panday-i-feel-bad-for-my-children-who-have-not-seen-that-era-of-zero-social-pressure/articleshow/73731581.cms
20,['30/01/2020'],H.E. Amjad Khan: I didn’t seek Malala’s permission for Gul Makai and that was a huge risk,"As Gul Makai, a film based on the struggles of Nobel Laureate Malala Yousafzai , opens in cinemas this week, its director, H.E. Amjad Khan , spoke to BT about his journey with the film and why he didn’t ask the Pakistani activist’s consent before making it. Excerpts:Malala symbolises the strength and sheer grit that girls have. What inspired me the most was the fact that at the tender age of nine or ten, she started blogging and by the age of 12, people were following her writings. That himmat and that jazbaa to fight the might of guns with a pen drove me to make a film on her. I wanted to salute Malala’s spirit.I was in talks with Mel Gibson’s company, and actress Monica Belluci also discussed the project with us, but there were budget issues. I also realised that the film will lose its flavour if made in English. The locals in the region where the story is set speak Pashto and Urdu. English would have dampened the effect of what they say. So, in such a case, casting a foreigner would also not have helped much. I feared losing the subject’s authenticity. So, we decided to make it in India with the right cast.That thought never crossed my mind because I didn’t see an A-list actor fitting into my film. I don’t mean to criticise anyone. Stars are famous people and everyone loves watching them, but as actors, yeh apne dushman khud ban jaate hain. On screen, their personality often overshadows the character’s traits. So, I feared that if I cast a known name, people will not see Malala as Malala, they will see the actor who is playing her. I wanted to keep it real and I signed up actors accordingly. For the larger part of the cast, I signed up actors from institutes like the Film and Television Institute of India and the National School of Drama . I signed 200 of them to play Taliban terrorists.The truth is that I didn’t seek her permission and that was a huge risk that I ran. Ise meri himmat hi kahiye that I made the film without her permission. Things could have gone south had she decided to move court against me for this. But I decided to keep it all authentic — facts, incidents and their portrayal. There was not a percentage of fiction in the narrative. She’s a revered figure and I was only trying to glorify what she did through my film. I thought, why would she have a problem with me praising her? The tendency that most filmmakers have is to add doses of fictional elements, which makes it necessary for them to seek the subject’s permission and you also need to add disclaimers. Had this film been controversial, I would have needed consent. Yes, my film has a disclaimer, but only to say that we don’t intend to hurt the sentiments of any community.Yes, she has and she loved it. She saw it with her entire family and also the driver who was at the bus’ steering wheel when she was shot at. The family could not sit through the film in one go. In the first few minutes, the film transports you to the land where Malala braved strong opposition and life threats to be who she is. The family took breaks between the film and was teary-eyed when it ended. I was happy at that time, but I became more confident when I showed the film to 400 special guests, which included international authors and political figures from different countries, including India and Pakistan.Your film is releasing along with a couple of big-ticket movies. Do you now think that it would have been wiser to wait for a better window to release Gul Makai?No contest is complete without multiple participants. So, why will I be scared of my film releasing alongside several others? Today, a solo release is a distant dream. The timing is apt to speak about women’s empowerment and girl’s education because aaj har ghar mein ek Malala hai. The only thing is, her parents and she are not aware of it. Let a girl follow her dreams and she will make everyone proud. Over a period of time, people have become aware of my film. A flower will spread its fragrance even if it’s planted in a corner of the garden. Given how important the film is, and the subject that it talks about, people will acknowledge it.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73732328,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-77373/73732328.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/h-e-amjad-khan-i-didnt-seek-malalas-permission-for-gul-makai-and-that-was-a-huge-risk/articleshow/73731817.cms
21,['30/01/2020'],Hair glam 2020: Ready to sport messiness a la the ‘modern shag’?,"Like it short? Go for a pixie cut hat to add a playful edge to the modern swag.

Use lowlights to make wispy hair appear thicker.

If you are wearing a shorter shag haircut, use an iron to smoothen out the front ends

The haircut has a kind of rebellious look, which makes it apt for boho style.

It makes any hair look voluminous due to the layers.

For more texture, use a little mousse or leave-on styling gel while the hair is wet.

The rule is: The shorter choppier shag flatters oval faces more than round ones. The side-parted shag frames a round face perfectly.

If fashion took a retro turn at the end of 2019 and into 2020, can hair trends be far behind? A hairstyle — that’s actually a nod to the rock star chic of the 70s — is set to become the hot grab this year. What’s more it’s unfussed, unkempt and requires no maintenance. Say hello to the ‘modern shag’. Actress Michelle Pfeiffer has been the queen of this style — she’s often sported a long wavy hair in messy waves.

And showing those ankles is something that never crossed my mind,"" says 24-year-old content writer, Shivam, scoffing at the idea of people choosing to bare their ankles during the winter season.While for some, the season of bare ankles had officially come to a close by the end of November, others refuse to surrender to the winter chill. These days, so many men and women, walk around with their ankles exposed, wearing socks that don't show. One knows fashion is about details and it's not the most controversial fashion choice ever, but what really goes on inside the minds of those who are too cool to cover their ankles? Let’s find out.For 23-year-old fashion merchandiser Anshika Sabhani, putting together a good look is rejuvenating. And though she does not believe in following trends blindly, the whole idea of showing some skin on the ankles is ""very chic"" for her. ""While one can also wear ankle boots, some outfits ask for sneakers or low ankle booties. The idea is to give your outfit a break, or say, a breathing space between your pants and the shoes,"" she says.Deepika Padukone sports turn-ups with sneakersBut what is so wrong about those teeny-tiny socks that make people want to keep them under wraps? ""They make you look frumpy and can ruin the entire look,"" feels Ishita Sachdeva. The Miss India Universe 2016 finalist says that ""socks have a very utilitarian purpose, and though they have been given a 'stylish' update, with metallic prints and glitter, they can never be appealing.""Kangana Ranaut styles a suit with ankle bootsDelhi-based image consultant and personal stylist Nidhi Jagtiani feels that some people prefer wearing shoes without socks or with no-show socks to make them look taller. ""Bare ankles give an illusion of height,"" she says. Celebrity stylist Devakshi Misra adds, ""While it shouldn't matter that much, but if you have a petite frame and you're wearing bulky shoes already, you may not want to wear socks that show as it may not look flattering.""Sonam Kapoor Ahuja flashes her ankles in cropped leggings and white sneakersRachita Dewan, 27, doesn't feel there's anything unusual about her bare ankles as she's aware of how much cold she can endure. Moreover, she says she's mostly in motion at her workplace and that keeps her warm. ""To my advantage, I'm mostly working indoors,"" says the sales representative with a multinational company. ""If on a day I feel I'll freeze, I'll wear socks or whatever to cover up."" If one does not like the idea of showing their socks, there are alternatives like ""sock boots that are so in right now"", adds Devakshi.For Shivam, still, the obsession of freezing oneself to show just a few inches of skin is ""not rational."" Well, that remains one of the classic cliche – 'fashion over comfort'. Moreover, like Shivam says, it's ""just a few inches of skin"", after all.Leather or suede, flat-soled or with block heels, knee-high boots are uber stylish.: A hybrid of socks and ankle boots, they are available in various textures – leather, velvet and PVC.

CAA

resolution: India blames POK-born MEP

NEW DELHI: In a relief for India, the European Parliament decided to postpone voting on a critical anti-CAA resolution to March even as it went ahead with the debate on Wednesday. The resolution was jointly introduced by five major groups across political leanings.The groups — from centre-right to far-left — account for more than 500 MEPs in the 751-member house. But when the resolution was taken up, of the 483 MEPs present, 271 voted to delay the vote on resolution, while 199 didn’t want it postponed and 13 abstained. An official source said India’s diplomatic offensive in the past few days, mainly in Brussels but here too with European envoys, resulted in a “diplomatic win” where the vote has been put off. The diplomatic drive was aimed at clearing up “misunderstandings” over the nature and implications of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.The proposal to postpone the vote was brought by Michael Gahler , a member of the group of the centre-right European People’s Party, which has the largest number of MEPs (182).With the vote kicked down the road, India has more time to work diplomatic channels and reach out to MEPs. India has also blamed POK-born MEP Shaffaq Mohammed for the resolution.Friends of India prevailed over the Friends of Pakistan in the European Parliament today. Strenuous efforts of outgoing British MEP Shaffaq Mohammad to have a resolution passed by the European Parliament against India on the penultimate day before Brexit were defeated, said a source. British MEPs will cease to be members of the European Parliament once Brexit comes into effect on Friday.The CAA is a matter internal to India and has been adopted through a due process through democratic means. We expect that our perspectives in this matter will be understood by all objective and fair-minded MEPs, the Indian source added. While the joint resolution dropped mention of Kashmir and UNSC resolutions, which one of the groups had mentioned, it saw no tempering of language.The joint resolution said it deeply regrets the adoption and implementation of CAA, which it says is discriminatory in nature and divisive. It further says CAA violates India international obligations and warns against increasing nationalism, which it claims has fuelled religious intolerance against Muslims.The resolution though was never going to be binding on the European Council, which is responsible for setting the political agenda and, as Indian officials have repeatedly pointed to, could not be seen as the EU official position. As France has already said, the European Parliament is an institution independent of member states and the European Commission.Sources said the EU was looking forward to the annual India-EU summit in March and the business and trade opportunities it might lead to. They didn’t rule out discussions with Indian authorities on the new act though.The problem for India is that the resolution still retains some of the nastiest bits from the earlier resolutions.Read this story in Bengali",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73747205,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1350080,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/european-parliament-puts-off-vote-on-anti-caa-resolution/articleshow/73747176.cms

‘Not a must for Muslim women to join prayer congregations’

NEW DELHI: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board told the Supreme Court on Tuesday that Muslim women are free to enter a mosque to offer prayers but since Islam has not made it obligatory for women to join congregational prayer, the court cannot enter the religious arena to decide this issue.Responding to petitions in the SC on women’s right to enter the Sabarimala temple, mosques and entry of Parsi women who marry outside the community into agiyaris, the AIMPLB said, “A Muslim woman is free to enter a masjid for prayers. It is her choice to exercise her right to avail of such facilities as available. AIMPLB does not want to comment on any contrary religious opinion on this issue.”However, the board was of the strong view that the entry of Muslim women into mosques fell squarely within the religious domain. “The questions as raised in the petition are relating to doctrine of religious principles and directly in relation to tenets of Islam… It shall not be appropriate for the Supreme Court to enter into the religious practices...” the AIMPLB said.The rights claimed in the petition do not merely concern the management of a religious place neither do they concern regulating the activities connected with religious practice,” AIMPLB said.It said a muttawali manages a mosque and it is his private decision to regulate the entry of worshipers. This could not be equated with state action to make it liable for a test of constitutionality. Refusing to join issue with others in the community who feel Muslim women should not enter mosques, the AIMPLB said, “Islam has not made it obligatory on Muslim women to join congregational prayer nor is it obligatory for women to offer Friday namaz in congregation though it is so for Muslim men.” On fatwas being issued barring entry of Muslim women in mosques, it said fatwas are opinions based on religious texts and their interpretation and have no statutory force.

Indian cities were included in the global ranking for the first time in 2017.Friday evening (7-8 pm) was the worst period for commuters in Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. One could save up to five hours annually for a 30-minute commute by deferring the journey post-8pm on these days.According to the report, on average, Delhiites driving during peak hours spent an extra 190 hours or seven days and 22 hours in traffic during 2019. In the case of drivers in Bengaluru, the extra time spent on roads was 243 hours or 10 days and 3 hours while time wasted in congestion on Mumbai roads was equivalent to 8 days and 17 hours.In Delhi, roads were most congested on Oct 23 last yrPune commuters wasted around 8 days and one hour due to idling on roads. The report says October 23 last year saw the worst traffic congestion on Delhi’s streets. One of the major reasons for acute congestion in Delhi was the protest by nearly 200 physically challenged people, who had taken over Mandi House, leaving central Delhi gridlocked . The protesters were demonstrating against the railways for failing to give them jobs.Mumbai witnessed its worst traffic jam on September 9 while in Pune, August 2 was the worst day for the commuters on the city roads.In the case of Bengaluru, August 20 saw maximum traffic congestion. “We get the data from multiple sources across the globe and in every few seconds, we get updates from nearly 600 million devices,” said TomTom’s strategic business development manager, Vinod Kumar .Read this story in Gujarati",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73747764,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-511672,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bengaluru-has-worlds-worst-traffic-congestion-mumbai-at-number-4/articleshow/73747725.cms

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed Nirbhaya case convict Mukesh Singh’s final bid to win relief against his hanging, where he had challenged rejection of his mercy plea by the President.

By evening, co-convict Vinay’s advocate A P Singh said he had filed a mercy plea directly in the President’s Secretariat while the SC agreed to examine on Thursday another prisoner, Akshay’s, curative petition, reports Abhinav Garg. This appears to be tactical litigation as section 854 of the revised Delhi Prison Rule says in case of multiple death row convicts in the same crime, none can be hanged till the last one has exhausted all options.

Former law officer of Tihar jail Sunil Gupta said, “Even if the President moves as swiftly as he did with Mukesh’s plea, two weeks time before execution has to be granted.” Pawan , the fourth convict, is yet to file a curative plea.

Former CMD of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) Kapil Wadhawan (File photo)

MUMBAI/ NEW DELHI: Former CMD of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd ( DHFL ) Kapil Wadhawan had allegedly siphoned off Rs 12,773 crore bank money with the help of 79 shadow entities and one lakh fictitious customers, alleged the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday.

A few city-based builders are under the ED scanner in the case as part of the money was allegedly diverted to them through fictitious transactions. “The malaise is running deep and rough estimate gives (sic) such illegal diversions of funds to 79 such shadowy entities without any sanction or paperwork in garb of retail loans to approximately one lakh fictitious individual customers to be in access of Rs 12,773 crore in 2015,” the ED alleged in its plea before the special court seeking seven-day extension of Wadhawan’s custody.

ED officials are trying to trace the money trail by investigating details of the shadow entities. The entities existed only on paper and were allegedly linked to the promoters, the ED said. The directorate produced Wadhawan before a special court on Wednesday, and his custody was extended till Friday.

The defence told the court that Wadhawan was suspected to be suffering from swine flu. The ED had arrested Wadhawan on Monday in the money laundering case it is investigating against Iqbal Memon alias Mirchi and for siphoning off funds. The ED alleged part of the siphoned-off money was also used to pay Mirchi for purchasing his three buildings at Worli.

During the remand hearing on Wednesday, Wadhawan’s advocate Amit Desai told the court that the ED is investigating him for siphoning off DHFL funds, and this was not connected with the money laundering case involving Mirchi.

Desai said the funds which ED claimed had left DHFL did not go into any Mirchi matter. “It has nothing to do with Iqbal Mirchi ,” Desai said. He also submitted the money was invested in various assets, which have now become security. “Over the last one and a half years, Wadhawan has made sure all those assets where the funds were being utilised are all the security of DHFL under the supervision of banks who were participating in the activities of discharging the liability. These assets are now available for the benefit of creditors of DHFL,” he said. Desai said that among the assets are also large lands outside the city under development, and their term sheets show that if fully developed, their value would be in excess of Rs 30,000 crore. “This is far more than the claims that are outstanding today,” Desai said.

DHFL owes Rs 83,873 crore to banks, mutual funds and investors and is the first non-banking finance company (NBFC) to be referred to the bankruptcy court by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) last November.

But the ED insisted that siphoning off funds was connected with the money laundering case. They alleged part of the siphoned-off fund was used to pay Mirchi and the rest was laundered. The remand plea submitted and argued by ED special counsel Hiten Venegaonkar and Sunil Gonsalves said the investigating agency had recorded statements of several present and former senior officials of DHFL. The statements of persons disclosed a startling fact about the state of affairs and gory saga of siphoning, money laundering and other serious offences, the directorate said.

The ED told the court that Wadhawan was instrumental in the working of DHFL group decisions to grant loans to these companies and he was not revealing anything during interrogation. It also informed the court they were searching some premises from Wednesday noon and had collected digital evidences which they needed to confront Wadhawan with.

The ED said, “It appears to be a scam of wider ramifications wherein more than Rs12,700 crore has been diverted illegally and Wadhawan is a prime conspirator.”

It stated that DHFL had given Rs 50 crore loan to Sunblink to purchase Mirchi’s property though there was no property in the name of the company. Apart from that, it said DHFL diverted a loan amounting to Rs 1,500 crore (with interest it’s Rs 2,186 crore) to five shell companies in 2011-12 “without any legal authority and under the garb of housing loan etc to individual customers”. While clearing loans to the five entities, procedure was not followed as security for the loan was not created and the issue was not cleared by the board’s finance committee but signed only by the promoters, Dheeraj and Kapil Wadhawan.

Later, the five shell companies were merged with Sunblink to cover alleged diversions of loans acquired from DHFL. The ED said later Sunblink created a new mortgage on the Worli buildings showing its worth as Rs 2,186 crore, though Sunblink had purchased the property for Rs 111 crore. The ED claimed Wadhawan’s brother Dheeraj aka Baba Dewan paid Rs 154 crore directly to Mirchi abroad through one of his companies in Dubai. The ED suspects Wadhawan paid more money to Mirchi for redeveloping the Worli buildings. The ED said Sunblink is a front company of Wadhawan, where his relative Sunny Bhatija is a director.

The ED has filed a criminal case against Mirchi, his family members and others to probe money laundering charges for alleged illegal dealings in purchase and sale of costly real estate assets in Mumbai. Mirchi, who died in 2013 in London, was said to be the right-hand man of global terrorist Dawood Ibrahim.

Kerala governor Arif Mohammed Khan during his speech in the assembly

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A day after writing to Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan that he would not read the paragraph mentioning the passage of the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act in his budget session address to the state assembly, governor Arif Mohammed Khan acceded to the CM’s request on Wednesday.

Amid a high-voltage protest and boycott by the opposition Congress-led UDF, Khan presented his policy address and read out the references to the anti-CAA resolution, despite his “deep reservations”.

Pinarayi had written to him on Wednesday morning requesting him to maintain constitutional propriety.

“I have been corresponding with the CM on the matter for the last few days. I disagree with the government view but I will read to honour his request,” the governor said in his speech, in a surprising turn of events which continued to mark the ‘dramatic’ day.

The controversial paragraph said: “Our citizenship can never be on the basis of religion as this goes against the grain of secularism, which is part of the basic structure of our Constitution. This august body unanimously passed a resolution requesting the Centre to abrogate CAA , 2019, which my government believes goes against cardinal principles underlying our Constitution. Pursuant to this, my government has filed an original suit before the honourable Supreme Court invoking provisions of Article 131.”

Governor Khan, accompanied by the CM, speaker P Sreeramakrishnan and parliamentary minister A K Balan, had to wait for few minutes inside the well of the House as opposition members blocked the passage. As soon as the governor entered the House, the opposition MLAs shouted “Governor go back!” and blocked the passage and prevented him from entering the dais of the speaker. Even though the speaker requested the MLAs to go back to their seats and allow Khan to deliver his address, the opposition members were unrelenting.

Khan then called the watch and wards of the House and asked them to remove the protesting MLAs.

Opposition member Ramesh Chennithala told reporters that the state government and the governor had come to a “truce”. “The CM’s double stand has been exposed now. The CM begged the governor to read the policy address. This is a ploy to escape from the Lavlin case which may come up soon,” he alleged.

The Supreme Court has been hearing a batch of petitions challenging the Kerala high court’s 2018 order discharging Vijayan and others in an alleged graft case involving an award of contract to a Canadian firm SNC-Lavalin for the renovation and modernisation of three hydroelectric projects in 1997.

In his letter to the governor on Wednesday, the CM, said sources, quoted Article 176 which describes the duty of the governor to the assembly. “I request you to read out the speech approved by the council of ministers in its entirety without addition or deletion.”

This is a ploy to escape from the Lavlin case which may come up soon,” he alleged.The Supreme Court has been hearing a batch of petitions challenging the Kerala high court’s 2018 order discharging Vijayan and others in an alleged graft case involving an award of contract to a Canadian firm SNC-Lavalin for the renovation and modernisation of three hydroelectric projects in 1997.In his letter to the governor on Wednesday, the CM, said sources, quoted Article 176 which describes the duty of the governor to the assembly. “I request you to read out the speech approved by the council of ministers in its entirety without addition or deletion.”",politics,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73748787,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-931864,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//politics/news/kerala-governor-reads-governments-speech-under-protest/articleshow/73755996.cms

NEW DELHI: The Cabinet on Wednesday approved the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill , 2020 aiming to make legal access to MTP or abortion easier for special category women, including survivors of rape, victims of incest, single women (unmarried/divorced/widowed to be established on the basis of self-certification of woman), and other vulnerable women (differently-abled women).

The proposals also suggest an increase in the upper gestational limit for termination of pregnancy for survivors of rape to 24 weeks from 20 weeks. For pregnancies diagnosed with substantial fetal abnormalities, it has been proposed, that no upper gestation limit would apply for termination.

The bill will be tabled in the ensuing Parliament session.

If the termination has to be in 20 weeks, the opinion of one doctor is required. Beyond that, opinion of two doctors would be needed and one has to be a government physician, Union minister Prakash Javadekar said on Wednesday.

Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The IAF remains fully convinced that Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman , who was awarded the Vir Chakra on Independence Day last year, shot down a technologically superior Pakistani F-16 before his MiG-21 itself was downed during the aerial skirmish on February 27 last year, while rubbishing reports that the narrative was far-fetched.

“Despite the enemy’s immense numerical and technological superiority, Wing Commander Varthaman proceeded to courageously engage the enemy aircraft package with utter disregard to his personal safety,” says the gallantry citation for the Vir Chakra, which was not made public earlier.

The audacious pre-dawn air strikes on the Jaish-e-Mohammed facility at Balakot on February 26 last year and the subsequent skirmish between Indian and Pakistani fighters garnered a dozen medals for the IAF. It included Vayu Sena Medals for the five Mirage-2000 pilots who successfully struck the JeM facility with Spice-2000 penetration bombs after crossing the Line of Control in the early hours of February 26.

The next day, Pakistan mounted a massive retaliation with advanced fourth generation F-16 and JF-17 fighters. The enemy aircraft were armed with beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air missiles and advanced high-calibre air-to-ground stand-off weapons.

Wing Commander Varthaman was among the fighter pilots who were scrambled from Srinagar air base to intercept the incoming hostile jets. “Displaying exceptional air combat acumen and knowledge of the enemy’s tactics, Wing Commander Varthaman scanned the low-altitude airspace with his airborne intercept radar and picked up an enemy aircraft that was flying low to ambush the Indian fighter interceptors,” says the citation.

“Wing Commander Vardhaman alerted the other formation pilots towards this surprise threat. He then consolidated the riposte by gathering his wingman in an offensive formation against the hostile Pakistani aircraft now dropping weapons on Indian Army positions,” it says.

“This audacious and aggressive maneuver forced the enemy aircraft into tactical chaos. All the enemy aircraft thereafter turned back, including the rear echelon aircraft who were yet to launch their air-to-ground weapons,” it adds.

Wing Commander Varthaman, in his MiG-21, then pursued a “retreating enemy fighter/bomber aircraft, and in the ensuing aerial battle “shot down the F-16 with his on-board missile”, it says.

But in the melee, one of the enemy aircraft fired multiple advanced BVR missiles, one of which hit his MiG-21, forcing him to eject in enemy territory.

“Despite being captured by the enemy, he continued to display exceptional resolve in dealing with the adversary in a stoic, brave and dignified manner till he was repatriated on March 1,” says the citation.

“His actions raised the morale of the armed forces in general and the IAF in particular. He showed conspicuous courage, demonstrated gallantry in the face of the enemy while disregarding personal safety and displayed exceptional sense of duty,” it adds.

CM Nitish Kumar with his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi and others inaugurate the Baudh Mahotsava in Gaya

GAYA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday evening inaugurated the Bodh Mahotsava 2020, a permanent feature of the Gaya calendar for the last three decades.

He also ensured security of the Mahabodhi temple and all-round development of Bodh Gaya.

Chanting of Buddist mantras by ceremonially dressed Tibetan monks marked the beginning of the three-day event, the main attraction being the performance of a dance drama by Hema Malini. Other attractions include performance by cultural troupes from nine different countries including Japan, Laos and Taiwan.

In his inaugural speech, Nitish recalled the terrorist attack on Mahabodhi Temple in July 2013 and said that shrine’s security was very high on his priority list. A frequent visitors to the shrine, the CM said that he does not only offer prayers at the shrine but minutely observes the security arrangements. The shrine will be provided aerial link with the nearby JP Botanical garden so that pilgrims can use the garden space for meditation and other spiritual purposes, said the CM.

Expressing dissatisfaction with the ongoing renovation of Muclind and Maya Sarovars, the CM said a more concerted effort was needed where Buddha is believed to have spent the last but one week of his seven-week-long meditation at seven different points. The present Muclind Sarovar on the temple premises was only symbolic and the real one was located at Mocharim village, recalled the CM.

Reiterating his commitment towards inclusive growth and development with justice, the CM said that he was relentlessly working for the mainstreaming of marginalised sections including, dalits, EBCs and minorities. He was there only to serve the people and nothing else occupied his mind.

The CM also said that about 3.5 crore domestic and 11 lakh foreign tourists are now visiting Bihar and the maximum foreign tourist footfall was in Bodh Gaya. Announcing a slew of measures for the development of Bodh Gaya, Nitish said that people here need not worry about drinking water as Ganga water would now be quenching their thirst. He has also taken the initiative to ensure at least two feet deep water in the perenialy dry Falgu near the Vishnupad temple.

He also referred to the proposed construction of path way on river Niranjana between Mocharim village and Bodh Gaya and ropeway provision in Dhungeshwari, Pretshila and Brahmajoni hillocks. The CM had all praise for BTMC secretary N Dorje.

Speaking on the occasion, deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi said the construction of the international convention centre will take more time than originally planned. It was likely to be completed in one-and-a-half years time from now.

Those who spoke on the occasion included education minister Krishna Nandan Verma and agriculture minister Prem Kumar. Tourism minister Krishna Kumar Rishi presided over the function. Earlier, in his welcome address, Gaya DM Abhishek Singh said that all efforts are being made to ensure the shrine security and separate entry and exit points have been developed in view of the shrine’s security requirements.

Representative image

PATNA: Around 4.5 lakh niyojit (contractual) teachers of government and government-aided schools would go on indefinite strike from February 17 to press their demand of equal pay for equal work, pension scheme and service conditions among others. They belong to 32 teachers’ organizations and associations in the state.

The decision was taken in a meeting on Tuesday under the banner of Bihar Rajya Shikshak Sangharsh Samanvay Samiti (BRSSSS). The meeting was chaired by Bihar State Primary Teachers’ Association president Brajnandan Sharma.

The schoolteachers hired on contract in primary, secondary and higher secondary government schools have given an ultimatum to the state government about their strike from February 17.

A core committee of 11 members was formed to make the strike successful. The members included Brajnandan, Pradeep Kumar Pappu (president of Bihar Rajya Prarambhik Shikshak Sangh), Anand Kaushal Singh (president of Bihar Panchayat Nagar Prarambhik Shikshak Sangh) and Banshidhar (president of Parivartankari Prarambhik Shikshak Sangh) among others.

Brajnandan told this newspaper on Wednesday that if the state government failed to accept their demands of equal pay for equal work, they will be left with no other alternative but to launch an agitation. “All the teachers will stage protest on their respective school campus. We will not engage any class till our demands are fulfilled,” he said.

BRSSSS (Patna region) convener Prem Kumar said all niyojit teachers have come on a single platform to paralyse all government schools if the state government failed to accept their demands.

“There are 5 lakh government schoolteachers and 4.5 lakh of them are on contract. We will lock the gates of the schools and there will be no classes. If the state government fufill our demands then we will call off our strike,” Kumar said.

The indefinite strike call given by the teachers of government schools and unaided institutions would hamper matriculation examination, which will begin on February 17.

Representative image

CHENNAI: After a circular from the chief educational officer (CEO) in Erode district ordering schools to conduct daily tests for Class VIII after school hours sparked controversy, officials from the directorate of elementary education claimed that it was a mistake.

According to the circular, schools were asked to allot one hour extra to conduct tests every day from Monday to Friday for Class VIII to prepare students for board exam.

“Questions will be asked from the first and the second terms. The tests would be conducted for 30 marks. During school hours, schools should prepare students for the third term,” the circular said.

Speaking to reporters, school education minister K A Sengottaiyan denied giving any such order and said the special classes will be held only during school hours. “Those students who are interested alone can take part in the special classes,” he said.

When enquired, officials from the directorate of elementary education said the circular was issued based on an old order. “We have not instructed the CEOs to conduct special classes or tests in view of the board exams,” they said.

A headmaster from city school said the special classes and coaching are given at school level and there is no direction from district education officials.

Some schools said they are revision tests for Class VIII students to prepare them to write a full-year’s subject. “Till last year, they were writing exams under trimester pattern where they write exam based on syllabus for that term alone. So, we are preparing them by conducting revision test for full year. But, we are conducting the tests during school hours,” another headmaster said.

Tamil Nadu Teachers Association president P K Ilamaran said conducting tests for Class VIII will put more pressure on young children. “Conducting daily tests for young students may increase drop outs in government schools. Already Class V and VIII students are not allowed to play in view of board exams. The circular would increase their stress. The government should reconsider its decision to conduct board exams for Class V and VIII,” he said.

CM Nitish Kumar

GAYA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday offered prayers at the world famous Mahabodhi temple and later in the day reviewed the ongoing development schemes in Bodh Gaya .

The most important ongoing project in Bodh Gaya that came for review by the CM is the construction of a world-class convention centre in the heritage town. Foundation for the convention centre was laid by the CM on October 18, 2018.

Being built on a 13 acre land at an estimated cost of Rs 145 crore, the construction, as per the original plan has to be completed by March 2020. The 2000 capacity cultural centre will also have a 500 capacity auditorium and a 1000 capacity banquet hall. It will have rain harvesting facility and eco-friendly lighting system. The development schemes also include a 100-bed guest house with five star facilities. Whereas, the Union government is funding the convention centre project, the guest house is being built by the state government.

Mahabodhi Temple, it may be recalled was notified as a world heritage site by UNESCO in 2002. The world cultural body also issued guidelines for future conservation of the shrine and moulding of development activities in sync with the parameters set by the organisation.

The UNESCO favoured a buffer zone in the shrine locality where no new constructions were to be permitted and the existing structures were allowed to decay and perish. The buffer zone comprised of 500 meters on all sides of the shrine outer wall.

The world cultural body also wanted the height of buildings outside the buffer zone to the regulated with no building above three meters (single storey) of height allowed in a radius of one km from the shrine. Buildings between 1-2 km radius from the shrine were to have a maximum height of nine meters. The UNESCO guidelines are yet to be followed. In 2005-06, the world body even threatened to withdraw the world heritage tag if the guidelines continue to be violated. UNESCO does not have coercive powers to get its guidelines implemented.

According to Arun Kumar Ojha, a hospitality sector expert, “A comprehensive plan that included good road, air connectivity, quality hotels and effective law and order machinery was required for any significant rise in foreign tourist footfall. The NH-83 was full of potholes, Dobhi-Patna road four-laning stands virtually abandoned and on account of short runway, wide body planes cannot land at Gaya airport, thereby causing development bottlenecks, said Ojha.”

The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Mohit Kumar Shah was hearing two PILs together filed by separate entities and it fixed February 7 as the next date of hearing. The development commissioner will also have to file a counter affidavit apprising the court about the developments made to complete the acquisition process.

It may be mentioned here that the CJ had gone to Gaya on an administrative tour, but had to leave his car there and return by train because of the potholes and ditches he encountered during the road journey.

During Wednesday’s hearing, development commissioner AK Singh, NHAI officers including its regional director, urban development and housing department secretary Anand Kishor, water resource department secretary Sanjeev Hans, Jehanabad DM Navin Kumar and two ADM rank officers who represented Patna DM Kumar Ravi and Gaya DM Abhishek Singh were present before the court.

The NHAI verbally appraised the court that land for 3.5km out of 34.1 km in Patna and 1.5km out of 59km in Gaya district was pending for acquisition. Besides, land for around 13km was also to be acquired in Jehanabad.

The bench also ordered development commissioner to bring on record any pending litigation for quick disposal to remove all hurdles coming in the process of acquisition.

An NGO Pratijnya, had filed a PIL this year urging the high court to direct the authorities concerned for completing the land acquisition process for the widening of NH-83 into four-lane which is pending for several years.

One Gaurav Kumar Singh had filed a PIL to stop dumping of garbage and sewerage in river Falgu along with providing proper civic amenities like drinking water to Gaya residents.

The court asked the UDHD secretary about the developments for providing civic amenities to Gaya residents to which he replied that talks were in advance stage for seeking assistance of around Rs 840 crore fromn the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to establish a sewage treatment plant (STP), besides a project for supplying drinking water is already underway and the deadline for completion is September 2021.

The bench also ordered the secretary to file a counter affidavit bringing all information about the projects on record before the court.

Surat: Police have installed heavy bandobust in Limbayat after an incident of stone pelting on a police team that was trying to stop a group of people from gathering around Madina mosque on Wednesday.

An assistant sub inspector suffered minor injury on his head in the incident. Meanwhile, police teams from different parts of the city have been sent to the area which helped disperse the mob.

Around 50 cops from local police and crime branch along with a platoon of state reserve police have been posted in Limbayat after the violence. Majority of the shops around the mosque remained closed.

When cops noticed two groups of protesters emerging from two different lanes, one from a lane besides Madina Mosque and another in Khanpur slums, they asked them to stop. However, the protesters refused to disperse and some started shouting.

“Some people from the group started pelted stones on the police when they were stopped, but we immediately controlled the situation and dispersed the crowd. Police are maintaining tight vigil in the area,” said R B Brahmbhatt, city police commissioner, who visited the area.

Raosaheb Girase, an SRP assistant sub inspector posted at Sangam Point, suffered minor injuries after being hit on the head by a stone.

A few leaders and workers from different groups were detained in Pandesara police station and Katargam police station for taking out a rally without permission. Pandesara police detained Suresh Sonavane, a Dalit leader, along with 15 others from near Prem Nagar for taking out a rally.

Around 50 persons were detained by Katargam police for gathering at the People’s Crossroads to protest against CAA. Of them 42 were from Bahujan Kranti Morcha while eight were from some other group.

Stone pelting was Kashmir-like: Paatil

Surat: Calling the stone pelting incident during the Bharat bandh in Limbayat as unfortunate, Navsari MP CR Paatil said the attacks were on the lines of Kashmir as the protestors had covered their faces with handkerchief.

Talking with TOI, Paatil said, “The scene in Limbayat was Kashmir like. Protestors who pelted stones had covered their faces with handkerchiefs as they did during the protests in Kashmir.”

Paatil said, “It is a matter of investigation by the police to nab the protesters involved in the attack.”

Blaming Congress behind the disturbance, Paatil alleged, “It was a Congress-sponsored attack. For this, they may have received funds from somewhere. The Congress is trying to disturb the peace in the city by instigating people in the minority dominated areas. The women in Limbayat had poured on the streets to depict the Shaheen Bagh protests against the CAA and NRC in Delhi.”

Surat: With an aim to increase its non-tax revenue , Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has come up with a new advertising and display policy.

Under this, the SMC aims to generate additional revenue of Rs 100 crore in the year 2020-21. Generation of this revenue will be obtained through digital display at around 100 different sites in the city at key locations, apart from revision of ad rates on private location through decentralization. At present, the SMC’s annual revenue in this segment is pathetic Rs 10 crore.

“We are looking at collecting additional revenue required for the city’s development work through non-traditional way. Time has come for Surat to garner revenue from sources other than traditional tax collections,” said SMC commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani.

“Till now, we have not explored locations in the city which have recently come up for public recreation like Shahid Smarak, Old Castle and Gopi Talav. We will explore the possibility of LED, other digital hoardings and display at more than 100 different sites,” Pani added.

To generate such revenue, the SMC needs additional manpower that can identify spots with potential and make use of that. “I have asked for rapid de-centralization of this work. Now, in place of town planning department, respective zones will be entrusted with the responsibility of locating and dealing with such spots so that quick tendering for rights of advertisements can be given.” explained Pani.

Under the new advertising policy, rates prevailing for hoardings and ads display in private properties will also be reviewed. Full potentials for digital displays of public places like areas near railway station, bus stations, air port, gardens and lakes will be explored and used.

At public facilities like foot over bridges, gentries and other areas under flyovers and bridges will also be identified and used for advertisement revenue earning.

“We will be coming up with e-tendering policy shortly so no time is wasted, and quick allotment can take place,” said an official from the town planning department.

“At present, the SMC’s revenue from such means is not more than Rs 10 crore per year because we have not explored this possibility till now mainly as the we didn’t feel the need to get additional revenue from other sources. But now, when Surat is taking next step towards becoming a mega city, such revenue will play a pivotal part in development,” the official added.

47,['30/01/2020'],Five more air quality monitoring systems to be set up in city,"This story is from January 30, 2020

At present, Surat has two air quality monitoring systems at Varaccha and Limbayat

Surat: Five more air quality monitoring systems will be set up in different zones of the city, with public display facility at a cost of Rs5.86 crore by May-end. With a population of over 55 lakh and 32 lakh vehicles, Surat has a vehicle ratio of one vehicle for every two persons living in 326 sq km area. Majority of these vehicles blow smoke and hence together with other causes of pollution, it is no surprise that air quality index in the city hovers over 100.

At present, Surat has two air quality monitoring systems at Varaccha and Limbayat. The new systems will be installed at Rang Upvan in central zone, Pandesara Industrial Association building in Udhna zone, water distribution centre at Katargam, Sanjeev Kumar Auditorium in Rander zone and Narmad Library in Athwa zone.

“The purpose is to reduce particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and PM 10 in our city and inform people about their minute to minute position. The public display facility will relay air quality index (AQI) together with time. This is one of our transformative projects aimed at changing the city and bettering its environmental standards to make it liveable for people. Exact time and data on pollution will help us to take corrective steps,” municipal commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani said.

Namrata Jariwala, assistant professor, civil department, Sardar Vallabhai National Institute of Technology, said, “It is not that city doesn’t have other forms of pollution. PM 10 is because of vehicular pollution and construction activity. We need to control this else itching and throat-related ailments will increase in winter months in the city.”

About 1,000 metric tonne cargo movement is expected every month

Surat: With the opening of the much-awaited domestic cargo terminal (DCT) on Wednesday, Surat airport has added yet another feather in its cap in infrastructure upgradation.

The state-of-the-art cargo terminal being operated by AAI Cargo Logistics and Allied Services Limited (AAICLAS), a subsidiary of AAI has set a target to increase cargo movement from the current 300 metric tonnes per month to more than 1,000 metric tones per month.

Talking at the inauguration ceremony at Surat airport on Wednesday, CEO of AAICLAS, Keku Bomi Gazder said, “Surat has become the 26th city in the country to have the cargo terminal. This terminal will cater to the ever increasing air cargo demand of the entire south Gujarat region. We are looking at doubling the cargo transport in the next couple of months.”

According to Gazder, the DCT is built at the cost of Rs 13 crore on 1,400 square metre having the capacity of handling 50,000 metric tonnes of cargo per annum. The cargo terminal is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities for handling in-bound and outbound cargo. The terminal has two strong rooms for valuable cargo, two dangerous cargo rooms and four cold storages for handling general goods, valuables, perishable items, hazardous cargo etc.

At present, Air India, Indigo and Spice Jet have been allotted separate space at the DCT for the cargo dispatch.

Spice jet to start freight craft next month

CEO of AAICLAS, Keku Bomi Gazder said that Spice Jet has decided to operate freighted cargo operation in the next one month from Surat airport. The freight aircraft will have capacity of about 18 metric tones. However, more than 30 metric tonnes of cargo will be catered by Spice Jet alone. This will increase the cargo movement exponentially.

Surat: Federation of Surat Textile Traders’ Association (FOSTTA) has asked textile market managements to comply with fire safety norms to protect markets from fire incidents.

FOSTTA has decided to convene a meeting of textile market managements for giving them necessary instructions regarding fire safety measures.

The decision has come after SMC’s fire and emergency services department started mock drill exercise in the textile markets located on Ring Road to identify obstacles. Fire officials said 21 textile markets were identified for the mock drill exercise that started on Saturday. The mock drill exercise will cover one market each day in the coming days. Fire department has encountered difficulty in entering many markets for carrying out firefighting activity.

FOSTTA office-bearers said majority of the markets located on Ring Road were constructed 30 years ago. FOSTTA secretary Champalal Bothra said, “Textile markets are vulnerable to fire hazards due to presence of highly inflammable polyester fabric material. Though, we have not witnessed massive fire like the one at Raghuvir textile market, but still textile traders have to take fire safety measures.”

Bothra added, “We had a meeting with fire department officials and they have instructed us to take immediate action on fire safety front. We have decided to convene a meeting of market managements to give them necessary instructions.”

FOSTTA president Manoj Agarwal said, “We have requested SMC to remove all illegal encroachments from textile market area, especially roadside eateries that use LPG cylinders. Majority of the markets are ready to comply with fire safety norms.”

Chief fire officer Basant Pareek told TOI, “We have been carrying out fire mock drills in the textile markets to understand the problems. In the last two days, we found that the entry gates at majority of the markets are very narrow and there are encroachments as well. We have discussed all the issues regarding fire safety with FOSTTA office-bearers.”

PATNA: All formations of Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) guarding porous India-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan border have been asked to keep an eye on people entering the country with symptoms like fever, running nose or throat infection and keep them in isolation in view of the globally spreading coronavirus from China.Sources said SSB headquarters in Delhi has issued a letter to all its frontiers engaged in guarding the border and manning trade routes and integrated border checkposts (ICP) to immediately segregate those who showed symptoms of coronavirus while entering India.They said the letter was sent to frontiers headquarters at Ranikhet in Uttarakhand, Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh , Patna in Bihar, Siliguri in West Bengal and Guwahati and Tejpur in Assam.A senior SSB officer, preferring anonymity, said personnel involved in guarding trade routes and frisking people entering Indian territory have been supplied with protective equipment, including gloves and masks, so that they don’t get infected with the virus.“In Bihar, there are ten trade routes, including two ICPs at Raxaul and Jogbani. SSB personnel are frisking people with their protective gears at all these places. We are keeping a close watch on people with specific facial features matching those from region from where virus started spreading,” he said.“Main movement takes place on India-Nepal border shared with Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.

Rapid response teams cull poultry in Bhubaneshwar

BHUBANESWAR: Shops selling chicken wear a deserted look in the city ever since news spread of the detection of bird flu virus in the poultry farm of Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) three days ago. There has been almost a 50 per cent drop in the sale of broiler and country chickens in the markets.

The chicken vendors in big markets have had to keep the stock of chicken without slaughtering them waiting for the customers.

“Earlier, we used to dress and keep the chicken ready beforehand. The stock would get exhausted quickly. But, now, due to the panic among people, we are keeping only livestock. Only when people ask for it do we cut the chicken,” said Manas Swain, who runs a poultry shop at Indradhanu market, one of the biggest markets in the city.

Manas said his small shop used to exhaust 100 kg of dressed chicken every day. But now only half of it sells. “Household consumption has fallen drastically. Whatever we sell is because of the bulk order from hotels. But even hotels have started ordering less,” he added.

Meanwhile, culling continued for the second consecutive day. The animal husbandry department deployed 14 rapid response teams (RRTs) for surveillance and culling of birds within one km radius of the epicentre of the affected area — the OUAT poultry farm.

“Five RRTs culled 80 birds, disposed of 1059 eggs and 10 kg poultry feed. Out of the birds, 38 were layer chicks, 38 layer adults and four adult ducks,” said Ratnakar Rout, director, animal husbandry department, adding that the government paid compensation of Rs 25,904 to the chicken vendors.

Sheikh Anwar, a bulk supplier of chickens, said he used to transport 10,000 birds every alternate day for supply to at least 30 shops. He expects chicken prices to slide. “The price of chicken, selling at Rs 180/kg (for dressed broiler), will start falling. Experts say if the chicken is boiled at more than 70 degrees centigrade, there will be no virus. Still people are panicking,” Anwar said.

Riddhima Panda, a home-maker said she has to drop chicken curry from the menu because of the H5N1 virus. “I know if we boil for long, there won’t be any harm. But still the fear lingers. We even stopped having eggs,” she said.

KOLKATA: Despite detailed planning by the government to create alternative corridors for traffic movement, the thought of Tallah Bridge being dismantled has sparked dread in daily commuters. The razing of the bridge is scheduled to begin on January 31.“The traffic congestion will be an unavoidable part of our daily struggle to commute to and from our workplaces. Important intersections, like Bagbazar and Chiria More, will be perpetually clogged,” said a commuter.The majority of those who use this corridor on a daily basis said that moving towards the heart of the city, where most offices are located, would be an issue. Comparatively, returning home will be easier. At present, the Lock Gate Flyover, which runs parallel to Tallah Bridge, is being used for north-bound vehicles. The south-bound traffic is diverted via the R G Kar Road bridge.Most people want Lock Gate Flyover to turn two-way for traffic. “I now take Tallah Bridge to go into the city. It would be good if the Chitpore Lock Gate is made both-way for light vehicles. The way cars are parked on Canal Side Road, it would only increase traffic congestion. The road leading from Lake Town to VIP Road is also in a poor state. Overall, it is going to be a messy affair,” said Mainak Banerjee, an actor who regularly comes into the city from Baranagar .Those who live in Belgachhia and Paikpara are facing a similar problem while travelling to Salt Lake . “Traffic congestion has increased ever since restrictions were put on Tallah Bridge. We do not know what will happen once it is demolished,” said Pranab Das, a resident of Belgachhia.“It takes a long time to move from BT Road to Shyambazar by bus as the vehicles are diverted. We are not clear on the traffic diversions that will be enforced once the bridge is shut,” said Rupankar Bera, who lives near Sinthee More.Rupanjan Mukherjee, a resident of Nilmoni Mitra Row in Tallah, said, “We live in an area which is locked from all sides by the canal, the rail tracks, the Tallah Bridge and Belgachhia bridge. With Tallah Bridge being blocked till the new structure comes up, we will have to take detours to go towards RG Kar Bridge.”There is a proposal to set up a footbridge over the tracks to connect Paikpara with Tallah.

Representative image

CHENNAI: The DMK ’s bid to transfer the 2016 RK Nagar voter bribery case to the CBI got a shot in the arm as the Madras high court impleaded the central agency as a party to the case on Wednesday.

A division bench of Justices M Sathyanarayanan and R Hemalatha concurred with senior counsel P Wilson and added CBI as the party primarily on two grounds.

One: Inspector of the Abhiramapuram police station, who registered the FIR, failed to name anyone as an accused in the case despite availability of three names, including that of health minister C Vijayabaskar, in the report filed by the Income Tax department and examining as many as 882 witnesses. Two: The prosecution failed to apprise a single judge, who quashed the FIR, that the quash petition was filed by a person whose name had not been mentioned in the FIR and that the de facto complainant had not been impleaded as a party to the case.

The issue pertains to the plea moved by then DMK candidate N Maruthu Ganesh alleging large scale electoral malpractices during the byelection by the ruling AIADMK which was deferred by the election commission. During the hearing, Wilson moved a miscellaneous petition on behalf of the petitioner seeking permission to amend the prayer of his petition so as to seek transfer of the probe to the CBI. Wilson also wanted the court to hold the election commission accountable for the damages suffered by the petitioner due to rescinding of the byelection and consequently direct the commission to reimburse the poll expenses incurred by petitioner.

Representative image

CHENNAI: After a circular from the chief educational officer (CEO) in Erode district ordering schools to conduct daily tests for Class VIII after school hours sparked controversy, officials from the directorate of elementary education claimed that it was a mistake.

According to the circular, schools were asked to allot one hour extra to conduct tests every day from Monday to Friday for Class VIII to prepare students for board exam.

“Questions will be asked from the first and the second terms. The tests would be conducted for 30 marks. During school hours, schools should prepare students for the third term,” the circular said.

Speaking to reporters, school education minister K A Sengottaiyan denied giving any such order and said the special classes will be held only during school hours. “Those students who are interested alone can take part in the special classes,” he said.

When enquired, officials from the directorate of elementary education said the circular was issued based on an old order. “We have not instructed the CEOs to conduct special classes or tests in view of the board exams,” they said.

A headmaster from city school said the special classes and coaching are given at school level and there is no direction from district education officials.

Some schools said they are revision tests for Class VIII students to prepare them to write a full-year’s subject. “Till last year, they were writing exams under trimester pattern where they write exam based on syllabus for that term alone. So, we are preparing them by conducting revision test for full year. But, we are conducting the tests during school hours,” another headmaster said.

Tamil Nadu Teachers Association president P K Ilamaran said conducting tests for Class VIII will put more pressure on young children. “Conducting daily tests for young students may increase drop outs in government schools. Already Class V and VIII students are not allowed to play in view of board exams. The circular would increase their stress. The government should reconsider its decision to conduct board exams for Class V and VIII,” he said.

CPI leader Kanhaiya Kumar in Patna

PATNA: Former JNU Students’ Union president Kanhaiya Kumar on Wednesday said anti-CAA activist Sharjeel Imam was intentionally being discussed to divert people’s attention from important issues in Delhi election. However, Kanhaiya clarified that he had ideological differences with Sharjeel and would not support anyone giving provocative speech.

Kanhaiya was talking to media at Gandhi Maidan before leaving for Bhitiharwa from where he will start his ‘Hamara Desh Hamara Samvidhan, Bapu Dham se Gandhi Maidan’ yatra on January 30. The yatra will conclude at Gandhi Maidan on February 29 with ‘Samvidhan Bachao Nagrikta Bachao’ rally. The yatra is being organized under the banner of NPR-NRC-CAA Virodhi Morcha.

When asked about Sharjeel, who is also a JNU student and facing sedition charge, Kanhaiya replied, “I am a law-abiding person and have faith in police investigation. I had also been called a traitor earlier.”

Talking about the yatra, Kanhaiya appealed to people of the state to join in large numbers. “We are not against giving nationality to anyone; rather we believe in Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam and whoever expresses faith in our Constitution should be given citizenship. In fact, the Citizenship Act was made in 2003 when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister, but this government passed another Act after 14 lakh out of 19 lakh people could not prove their nationality in Assam,” he said.

Kanhaiya further said there were chances of mistakes from the officials in collecting and jotting down the data in the process of updating the National Population Register (NPR), and poor will face the brunt. Those who will leave the column blank will be put in the category of doubtful citizen, he claimed.

He further said if chief minister Nitish Kumar was against the present form of NPR, he should pass a resolution against CAA in the assembly.

Kanhaiya was accompanied by Kadwa MLA and Congress national general secretary Shakeel Ahmad Khan and social activist Nivedita Jha.

56,['30/01/2020'],Six-member committee to study problems from Farakka barrage,"This story is from January 30, 2020

PATNA: CM Nitish Kumar ’s bid for a permanent solution to the problem of siltation in the riverbed of Ganga caused by Farakka barrage has got a shot in arm, as the six-member committee constituted by the Centre to make a detailed study of the problem would also include a representative of Bihar government.

State water resources department (WRD) minister Sanjay Kumar Jha said the Centre has decided to constitute the six-member team to make a detailed probe into the problem of siltation and floods in the Ganga due to various factors, including the blockage or controlled flow of water through the Farakka barrage. The information has been routed to the state WRD by the Union Jal Shakti Ministry.

The committee would comprise representatives from the Union Jal Shakti Ministry, Central Water Commission , River Development and Ganga Protection Department and the state government.

Jha said he had personally discussed the problem of siltation with Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in June and September last year. Subsequently, CM Nitish also discussed it with him, whereby the ministry gave an assurance to the state WRD in writing as far back as October 31 last year to constitute a high-level team of experts to study the problem.

Stating that he was “happy” that the team constituted would also include a representative of the state government, Jha said, “It is the first effective step taken by the Centre towards finding a permanent solution to the problem of siltation in the Ganga.”

The study made by the team would also look into the large-scale flooding of the Gangetic basin annually due to siltation in the riverbed due to Farakka barrage. Jha said the neglect of the problem for decades has made it “more complex”, as the river has been showing slow discharge of water along its downstream Buxar onwards, and waterlogging in the area has been persisting for a long period due to restricted or controlled flow of water through the Farakka barrage in whose operations the Bihar government has no say.

Incidentally, during the September floods last year, CM Nitish had to take up the matter with the PMO to ensure that the flow of water through the Farakka barrage was increased substantially.

As a result of it, a representative of the state WRD was deployed at Farakka barrage for coordination with the officials and engineers there in matters of the operations of the barrage and the flow of water through it was increased to mitigate the problem of unprecedented water logging at Patna, besides along the 12 districts that fall in the Ganga basin.

As to the problem becoming “more complex,” Jha also said that the discharge of water through the Ganga at Buxar had been reduced to 400 cumecs, as barrages had been constructed at several places in Uttar Pradesh and at Uttarakhand to divert Ganga water for irrigation purposes. Further, while Bihar is not left with desired level of Ganga water, its volume is maintained with 1,500 cumecs of water from Kosi, Gandak, Burhi Gandak, Bagmati and Mahananda rivers for supply to Bangladesh to comply with international agreement.

Further, CM Nitish has been raising the issue of the siltation of the Ganga since 2017. That year, two national seminars were held at Patna and Delhi on the same problem, and were known as Patna and Delhi declarations.

PATNA: The state transport department has introduced a separate cadre—Bihar Transport Service—for direct selection of assistant district transport officers (ADTO) and equivalent-rank officers through the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC). The decision was passed in the state cabinet on Tuesday evening.

Altogether 62 ADTOs, assistant regional transport officers and officers under the transport secretary and commissioner have been created in the transport department. The recruitments will be made through a combined BPSC examination. The matter was pending in the cabinet for over a year.

Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal told this newspaper on Wednesday that all the departments have their own cadre, but the transport department did not have any. “With our own cadre, we can promote an ADTO to district transport officer (DTO), assistant regional transport officer and officers under the transport secretary and commissioner. These officers will remain in the department till they retire,” he said.

At present, DTO’s deputation in the transport department has been done through the Bihar Administrative Services for a period of three years.

“Appointment of 50% posts in the transport department will be done through BPSC exam. Remaining 50% posts of motor vehicle inspectors and enforcement sub- inspectors will be filled through promotion of qualified members of Bihar Transport (technical) cadre and Bihar Transport (enforcement branch) cadre,” Agarwal said.

He added, “Since the department’s work has increased in the past few years, we need more people. In this regard, we will also increase the number of MVI from one to five in each district for different works like issuing permits, driving licenses, school buses and information and technology among others.”

The transport secretary also said that the department has also created new posts for transport constables to regulate traffic in Bihar and issue chalan to the violators. The selection for transport constables will be done on the basis of Bihar Police Constable Examination (BPCE), which will be held on February 2.

The company – which rolled out 6 new launches in 2019, 8-9 in 2018 and 9 in 2017 – will have 10-12 new products in 2020 as the market settles down after the BS6 migration, he added. The last time the luxe marque rolled out 10 or more models in a calendar year was in 2016 when it launched 12 products.

“In the last 18 months, our dealer partners have invested around Rs 100 crore to ramp up our network and we are also investing in new products and readying the capacity for this year,” said Schwenk. “After a good fourth quarter of calendar 2019, currently the luxury car market is in recovery mode and should be back to positive sales this year.” For Mercedes Benz, he added, the Q4 of calendar 2019 was the strongest Q4 ever though the overall year was a bad one. “We have come out of it and we have seen the bottom of it,” he said. Despite the slowdown, Mercedes Benz, he said, did not cut back on investment or launch plans or expansion of network into Tier 2/3 cities. “Not a single decision was revised,” said Schwenk. “The only thing we adjusted is the launch schedule of some products (including the long wheel base GLE SUV launched on Wednesday). Our mid and long-term view of India as a market has not changed at all. Nor are we reviewing our belief in the potential of tier 2/tier 3 markets,” he added. And while mass market brands are cutting their diesel exposure, Mercedes Benz will continue with a big diesel portfolio. “We are very strong with 75% of portfolio on diesel and this will remain,” said Schwenk. “Diesel is a big market and it is cleaner and more economical as well. Our diesel engines can undercut gasoline engines in terms of BS6 emission levels. We are not cutting back on diesel,” he said. As for future of luxe wheels post BS6, Mercedes Benz sees a strong recovery in the second half of 2020. “BS6 will cause a ripple,” said Schwenk. “The entire industry will have to control inventory as well as pricing but from the second half of the year we expect stability and increased sales at least in the luxury segment,” he said.

The four-seater aircraft is Cessna 182 Skylane and it will be used for private travel only

Surat: Soon , diamond barons in the world’s largest diamond cutting and polishing centre in Surat will fly high in their first private aircraft.

The Directorate of General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) has given the permission to the promoters of the city-based Ventura Airconnect, an airline company started by two diamond barons and a realtor, to import the four-seater aircraft for their private use. The promoters of Ventura Airconnect include Govind Dholakia, chairman of Shri Ramkrishna Exports (SRK); Savji Dholakia, chairman of Shri Hari Krishna Exports and a realtor Lavji Dalia.

This will be the first private aircraft to be imported in the city for private use from US. The four-seater aircraft is Cessna 182 Skylane and it will be used for private travel only.

Sources said that the aircraft has been purchased at the cost of Rs 6 crore. Due to the bad weather, the aircraft will be flying from Kansas in US in a day or two.

At present, the Ventura Airconnect company is operating flights from Surat to Bhavnagar and Amreli on daily basis. The company is using two nine-seater Cessna Grand Caravan aircrafts on these routes.

Talking with TOI, one of the promoters Dholakia said, “This is our first private aircraft. The aircraft is equipped with all latest navigation system and software and that it will be used for our personal travelling to Rajkot, Bhavnagar, Mumbai and Amreli.”

Pune: Bajaj Finserv said that its consolidated Q3 net profit rose 32% to Rs 1,126 crore helped mainly by a recurring good show from its consumer durables financing business.

The company wrote higher premiums across its life and general insurance businesses, but the profit it earned from the general insurance arm dipped about 15% to Rs 191 crore. “The general insurance business profit was affected by continued unseasonal rainfall which extended well into Q3,” the company said.

Bajaj Finserv added that the consolidated total income grew 31% to Rs 14,561 crore. The consumer lending arm’s Q3 net grew 45%. Consumer durable financier Bajaj Finance ’s quarterly net profit rose 52% to Rs 1,614 crore. The company said it was helped also by lower corporate taxes.

Notwithstanding the slowdown, the performance of the largest consumer durable financier in the country is reflective of more debt-fuelled purchases. At the same time, the company’s provision towards potential bad loans as a result of “expected credit loss” almost doubled to Rs 831 crore.

The company said that it added 13% new loans in the quarter taking the total loans booked in the quarter to 7.64 million.

62,['30/01/2020'],Payments banks need to justify their existence: StanChart arm,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Mayur Shetty | TNN

Mumbai: India’s rapid transformation from a data-poor country to a huge data-rich country has thrown up opportunities that can transform businesses, said Alex Manson , chief of SC Ventures — the innovation unit of Standard Chartered Bank . According to Manson, this is partly due to Aadhaar, but the number of sources of data is set to grow exponentially.

SC Ventures has been set up to prepare the banking group for the future. It operates in three areas — as a catalyst through its eXellerator lab to help the group in problem-solving and spreading innovation best practices. It also manages a $100-million fund that invests in emerging technology. Finally, it floats ventures that sponsor and oversee disruptive technology. The new digital bank licence the bank has won in Hong Kong is being operationalised through SC Ventures.

In an interview to TOI, Manson said that India is ahead of the West when it comes to payment applications like Unified Payments Interface (UPI). However, payments banks need to solve a problem that justifies their existence as a business. “What people have not done is articulated a sustained business model in payments. You think of payments as an app and not necessarily a business,” said Manson.

He added that payments are an integral part of the proposition and provide a lot of insights. SC Ventures ran an experiment monitoring supply chain payments. Based on the payments track record, the bank was able to predict operating risk and forecast issues such as working capital crunch.

Rather than operate a digital bank in India, SC Ventures has chosen to launch a platform for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). The platform SOLV, which is headed by Nitin Mittal from the bank, aims to addresses all the MSMEs’ needs of finding partners, suppliers, products and financing on one platform.

According to Manson, the interplay of banking and fintech could lead to three scenarios. The first one is where the banks merely need to focus on digitisation. The second one is where banks lose, and the platforms win by owning the relationships with the customer and banks plug into the platform. The third scenario is one where banks themselves become a platform. “My prediction is that we will end up with a permutation of the three scenarios,” said Manson.

“SC Ventures was born to create ventures that was separate from the bank to not just experiment but big scalable alternative business models which can become banking of the future. We have 23 ventures in the pipeline right now and it is a different stage of development and the most public one is the digital-only bank. We are building a plug-and-play bank, that can plug into someone else’s platform and collaborate with them,” Manson said.

PATNA: Criticizing the Centre over Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Kalkidhaam Pithadheshwar Acharya Pramod Krishnam on Wednesday said even spiritual and religious leaders of the country were worried as the new law was dividing the country.

Krishnam, who had contested on Congress’s ticket from Lucknow against Rajnath Singh, accused the BJP government of trying to script such a narrative as if the opposition was against giving citizenship to Hindus.

“We are not against giving citizenship to Hindus of Pakistan, Bangladesh or Afghanistan, but the basis should not be religion. Our Sanatan Dharm talks about ‘Vishwa Bandhu’. However, this law has belittled our culture and Sanatan Dharma,” he said and appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to revoke this law.

He said the ongoing protest against CAA was not by a particular community, but by all those who believe in the Constitution.

He further said since PM Modi and home minister Shah created all the confusion, hence they should clear the doubt. “PM Modi should depute his representatives to meet the people and address their problem. There is lawlessness in the country and present government is responsible for it,” he said.

He even accused BJP leaders of using foul language and asked PM to oust Anurag Thakur from his cabinet. Krishnam was accompanied by Ram Sena head Bishnu Vinodam, former MP Tariq Anwar and former state Congress presidents Shyam Sunder Singh Dheeraj and Sameer Singh.

Chennai: India’s leather and leather products exports between April-December dropped 7.6% to $3.5963 billion from $3.896 in the corresponding period in FY 19 on the back of a 35% drop in global leather prices.

PR Aqeel Ahmed, chairman, CLE added that the export of footwear alone (by volume) has gone up from 183 million pairs to 262 million pairs in 2019 and the drop in exports by value is because of a 35% decline in global leather prices.

“We are looking to turn this around in FY21 and are expecting a 5% growth in exports. For this, we are looking to attract investments from companies in Taiwan, China, South Korea, Japan and the USA, besides exploring new markets in South America and Japan,” he added.

67,['30/01/2020'],RBI ED appointed as MPC member,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Mumbai: Janak Raj , executive director at the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ,) has been nominated to the monetary policy committee ( MPC ) by the central bank’s board. Raj will step into the shoes of Michael Patra who was recently elevated to the position of deputy governor.

The MPC, which decides on interest rates every two months, comprises three external members and three members from the RBI including the governor. A vacancy was created following the exit of Viral Acharya , who oversaw monetary policy. His place was taken by B P Kanungo, who was officiating as in charge of the MPC. Earlier this month, the government named Patra as deputy governor to succeed Acharya.

The decision to appoint Raj was taken by the RBI’s central board, which had its 581st meeting on Wednesday in Mumbai under the chairmanship of Shaktikanta Das . The next MPC meet will take place after the Budget next week.

In 2017, a panel headed by Raj had recommended that the banks be directed to link their lending rates to a market benchmark to force them to pass on rate cuts by the RBI. The panel’s suggestions were accepted, and the banks were asked to choose between the RBI’s repo rate, treasury bills or certificate of deposits.

Arguing for market-linked rates, the report has said the transmission to lending rates was asymmetric over monetary policy cycles — higher during the tightening phase and lower during the easing phase — irrespective of the interest rate system.

One reason behind having an external benchmark was that the the pass-through to outstanding loans from the repo rate was around 60% during the tightening phase (July 2010 to March 2012), while it was less than 40% during the subsequent easing phase (April 2012 to June 2013).

“The efficacy of monetary policy depends on the magnitude and the speed with which policy rate changes are transmitted to the ultimate objectives of monetary policy — inflation and growth,” the report said.

Wednesday’s board meet was attended by RBI deputy governors B P Kanungo, M K Jain and M D Patra and other directors of the central board — N Chandrasekaran, Bharat Doshi, Sudhir Mankad, Ashok Gulati, Manish Sabharwal, Prasanna Kumar Mohanty, Satish K Marathe, Revathy Iyer and Sachin Chaturvedi. The minutes of the meeting are likely to be made public in a couple of months.

Surat: From February 1 , one of the most congested Sahara Darwaja underpasses in the city will partially close for vehicular traffic due to ongoing construction work of the railway overbridge. The bridge is being built at the cost of Rs 134 crore.

The Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has announced closure of traffic movement going out of the city limits towards areas like Puna and Dindoli for 21 days starting February 1. However, incoming traffic to Surat city from Kadodara via Sahara Darwaja will remain open.

According to SMC estimates, nearly 12-15 lakh people commute through the Sahara Darwaja railway underpass as it is a major entry and exit point to the city.

SMC commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani said, “The commuters were facing safety issues due to the ongoing construction. Also, the work was progressing a very slow pace. People travelling through the underpass were under constant fear of accident.”

He added, “Inconvenience of people is regretted but their safety cannot be compromised. We have given the contractor 21 days to finish the work.”

Because of the ongoing work, nearly 1.5 lakh vehicles that move to outer parts of the city via Sahara Darwaja areas like Puna and Dindoli, will have to either use Canal Corridor or go all the way to Rajmarg, take the Varachha underpass or already congested Sabras underpass to move to other side of the railway line.

An official from SMC’s bridge department said that this will increase traffic on Canal Corridor and to an extent on Rajmarg and towards Varachha main road.

70,['30/01/2020'],Cos cut CSR spends on national heritage by 56%,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Rupali Mukherjee | TNN

Mumbai: Companies more than halved their funding for national heritage, arts and culture, under corporate social responsibility ( CSR ). National heritage saw the largest drop of nearly 56% in 2018-19, even as spends on the welfare of armed forces increased by 84%, registering the highest growth.

Other areas that showed significant contribution from companies included reducing inequalities (41%) and healthcare (25%) year-on-year, according to data culled from NSEinfobase.com. Overall, CSR by companies — mandated by law — witnessed an increase of 18% to Rs 11,961 crore in 2018-19. Interestingly, even 37-odd loss-making companies earmarked funds for it, highlighting their zeal for making a change on the ground.

In 2018-19, a total of 219 companies invested Rs 175 crore, or over 1% of the total contribution, for heritage conservation, promoting art, craft and culture, with top contributors being REC, Oil India, Infosys and Wipro. It may be noted this emerging trend is on a low base. In the previous year, a large contribution totalling Rs 393 crore by 208 companies — including PSUs Bharat Petroleum, GAIL, Indian Oil and Engineers India — was done for the construction of Statue of Unity (Gujarat). The 56% drop in the following year came with companies reducing their contribution for national heritage, possibly with the structure reaching completion. Allocation to other categories remained fairly constant over the previous year.

The analysis is based on 1,132 companies listed on the NSE as on March 31, 2019, and mandated to spend on CSR, and for which details have been culled from their annual reports. The CSR law mandates companies with a net worth of Rs 500 crore and above, or revenue of Rs 1,000 crore and above, or net profit of Rs 5 crore and above to spend 2% of average net profits of the previous three years on CSR projects.

CSR expenditure by companies grew at a healthy compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17% over five years. A majority of the companies contributed to education (Rs 4,440 crore), followed by healthcare (Rs 3,242 crore), while areas such as welfare of armed forces, technology incubators, slum development and disaster management saw negligible spends.

The top 10 companies in terms of CSR spends in FY19 were Reliance (Rs 849 crore), ONGC (Rs 615 crore), IOC (Rs 491 crore), HDFC Bank (Rs 444 crore), TCS (Rs 434 crore), Infosys (Rs 342 crore), Tata Steel (Rs 315 crore), ITC (Rs 307 crore), NTPC (Rs 285 crore) and PGCIL (Rs 196 crore). The top 10 companies together spent 36% of total CSR spend. The number of companies that spent on CSR increased to 1,055 (93% of the mandated 1,132 companies) in 2018-19, from 1,024 (94%) in 2017-18. The balance 77 companies, despite being mandated, did not spend anything, it adds.

Further, a large chunk of CSR funds have been cornered by the more industrialised parts of the country like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, with others including Chhattisgarh and Jammu & Kashmir being left out.

Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has imposed a Rs 1-crore penalty on HDFC Bank for failing to comply with the central bank’s know your customer ( KYC ) norms. The RBI said that 39 current accounts opened by the bank had transactions disproportionate to the declared income and profile of the customers.

“Based on the observations made during the on-site inspection for FY17, a scrutiny of 39 current accounts opened by its customers for bidding in initial public offer was conducted by the RBI, which revealed that the bank had failed to exercise ongoing due diligence in those accounts,” the central bank said.

The RBI then issued a show-cause notice to the bank. After considering the bank’s response, the central bank concluded that the charge of non-compliance with the direction was sustained and warranted imposition of monetary penalty.

“This action is based on the deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank with its customers,” the RBI said.

HDFC Bank too informed the stock exchange of the penalty as part of its disclosures. Last year in July, the RBI had penalised a host of public sector banks for violation of KYC norms. Three lenders — Punjab National Bank, Allahabad Bank and UCO Bank — were fined Rs 50 lakh each, while a fine of Rs 25 lakh was imposed on Corporation Bank. The central bank had said that the penalty was for non-compliance with KYC requirement and norms for opening current accounts.

Police at the murder site in Pandesara on Wednesday

SURAT: A 35-year-old man was killed by his wife and her paramour during early hours on Wednesday in Vadod of Pandesara. The paramour was the deceased cooking gas and vegetable vendor’s employee and was staying in the neighbouring house. The man slit the victim’s throat to ensure that he is dead after smashing his head with a hammer while the wife held the deceased’s hands.

The murder was carried out by the mother in front of her four minor children after instructing them to lie to the police. However, the kids revealed the murder story to the cops.

Police booked Santosh Prajapati, a labourer, and Sudha Sonkar for allegedly killing her husband, 35-year-old Premchand. Sudha is arrested while Santosh is on the run. She was nabbed from her home.

Police investigation revealed that Premchand, who was a vegetable vendor cum cylinder delivery man , had employed Santosh a few months ago for petty jobs. Santosh, who lived in neighbouring house, soon developed illicit relation with his his employer’s wife.

Premchand came to know about the affair which led to frequent fights between the couple. Santosh and Sudha planned to kill Premchand and at around 1 am on Wednesday Sudha opened the door letting in Santosh who first strangled Premchand using a rope while Sudha held his hands. Later Sanstosh slit the throat with a knife besides dealing several blows on the head with a hammer. The murder was executed in presence of Premchand and Sudha’s four children, aged 11, 8, 5 and 2 years, respectively.

Later, Sudha locked her house from outside and went to Santosh’s home with the children. They spent the night in the house and Santosh left his house early in the morning.

Later Sudha came to her home and informed neighbours to help open her door. “She initially informed neighbours and police that robbers have killed her husband and also told her kids to repeat her story. But repeated questioning revealed the truth,” said a police officer at Pandesara police station.

KOLKATA: Even though the overcast sky and rain threatened to dampen the spirit of Saraswati Puja celebrations on Wednesday, the showers spared Kolkata during the rest of the day. The Met office , however, has predicted similar spells on Thursday too. A trough extending from Haryana to Bangladesh across Bihar and Uttar Pradesh is expected to trigger more rain.“The system that triggered rain on Wednesday is still active and, therefore, the sky will remain overcast on Thursday. There are chances of spells of rain, but they will be light. It should not be a cause for major concern,” said G K Das, director (weather) at Regional Meteorological Centre, Kolkata.The mercury shot up to 18.6°C on Wednesday, four notches above normal. The day, however, was pleasant with the maximum temperature sliding two notches below the normal mark to stand at 24.5°C. “We can expect the mercury to start sliding from Friday. By Saturday, it could hover around 13°C,” added Das.Kolkatans woke up to a dark sky and fog on Wednesday. While pockets in south Kolkata witnessed heavier rain, most parts of the city received light spells. Alipore recorded 5.8mm rain between 5.30am and 8.30am.Thereafter there was only a few spells of drizzle here and there. But despite the sky remaining cloudy for most of the day, the rain did not play spoilsport for celebrations.“It started raining in my locality from the wee hours on Wednesday. Thankfully, it stopped raining in time and I could go out with friends,” said Aghni Sen, a first-year college student from Lake Town.Apart from the trough, the Met office has also spotted a high-pressure zone over the Bay of Bengal. This system is injecting moisture into the land. These two systems will continue to push cloud formation.

PATNA: Universities in Bihar are all set to introduce choice-based credit system (CBCS) at the undergraduate-level from the new academic session commencing in July this year. The Raj Bhavan is busy finalizing the uniform ordinance and regulations of CBCS and also getting the syllabi of UG courses revised as per the new system.The universities had implemented CBCS at the postgraduate stage from the session 2018-19 itself, but they could not implement the same at undergraduate level as most degree colleges were not prepared for it. Now the universities as well as the colleges under their jurisdiction have geared up to accept the challenge and to implement the new mode of curriculum.“Patna University (PU) happens to be the only university in the state to introduce CBCS in all its self-financing (vocational) courses at the undergraduate-level from the current academic session (2019-20). However, in all the conventional courses at UG level, the CBCS would be implemented from the next academic session (2020-21),” PU vice-chancellor Rash Bihari Prasad Singh said.The VC pointed out that the Raj Bhavan had initiated necessary steps for revision of curriculum of all UG academic programmes in the light of CBCS. It was decided that the syllabus of a particular subject would be revised by a particular university with the help of all other universities where this subject is taught. The universities which were entrusted with the job of revision of syllabi of different subjects as per the UGC model syllabi included: Patna University (physics, mathematics, geography, personnel management and industrial relations, statistics, biochemistry, English, Urdu, Arabic, music and home science); Magadh University (economics, history, ancient Indian history, Magahi, chemistry, Buddhist studies and social work), BRA Bihar University ( botany, Hindi, Persian and electronics), Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University ( zoology, anthropology, computer science, sociology, Bengla and political science), Veer Kunwar Singh University ( philosophy and Bhojpuri), LN Mithila University ( psychology, commerce, Maithili), B N Mandal University (biotechnology and industrial microbiology) and Kameshwar Singh Darbhanga Sanskrit University (Sanskrit).It is learnt that most universities have already revised the syllabi and sent the same to the chancellor’s secretariat. Now Raj Bhavan would constitute subject-wise committees of experts and get the new syllabi vetted and modified by respective committees. Once the revised syllabi based on CBCS are finalized and the uniform ordinance and regulations are assented to by the chancellor, the same would be sent to all the universities for implementation.“The new academic programmes under CBCS would provide some flexibility to the students in the choice of subjects. These courses would be mainly of three types like core courses, discipline electives (from within the subject) and generic electives,” said PU pro-VC Dolly Sinha.",patna,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73758683,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-89476,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cbcs-for-undergrads-in-universities-soon/articleshow/73742622.cms

77,['30/01/2020'],New parking policy: Rs 1.6 lakh realized as fine in 45 days,"This story is from January 30, 2020

<p> Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport<br></p>

PATNA: Chaos continues to prevail outside the Jayaprakash Narayan International (JPNI) Airport ever since the implementation of the new parking policy of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) in December last year.

According to the airport authorities, a vehicle that jumps the permissible time limit of three minutes for picking up or dropping someone attracts a fine of Rs 500. Altogether 335 people have paid Rs 1.6 lakh as fine in 45 days for violating the parking policy on the airport premises.

A lot of people have also complained of slow traffic movement in the pick-and-drop area of the airport in the peak hours from 12pm to 5pm. Ramchandra Prasad Singh , in charge of traffic management at the airport, told this newspaper on Tuesday, “We have deployed 10 men to manage traffic near the terminal building during the peak hours when maximum number of flights arrive at and depart from the airport. It is, however, impossible to disperse a huge crowd sometimes.”

Singh added, “Another reason for traffic congestion near the terminal building is that people do not park their vehicles in the designated area near the ticket counter.”

Now, a public address system is being used at the airport to help people park their vehicles properly. However, many visitors and passengers are still having a harrowing time commuting between the entry and exit points of the airport.

After collecting her luggage at the airport on Tuesday, an engineering student, Avantika Agarwal, waited for a cab for half-an-hour near the terminal building. “It was a horrendous experience as the vehicles moved at a snail’s pace,” she rued.

Ravi Purohit, a bank employee, claimed that the traffic management staff had fined him wrongly. “When the vehicles are unable to move for more than five minutes, how can the staff fine me for crossing the free parking period?” he asked.

A private cab driver, Manoj Singh, said he usually parked his vehicle near the exit due to the fear of paying fine. “When passengers book my cab, I request them to come near the exit because there is lesser rush here,” he added.

79,['30/01/2020'],Anti-CAA bandh evokes mixed response in Bihar,"This story is from January 30, 2020

PATNA: The Bharat bandh called by several organizations and supported by opposition political parties against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and proposed NRC evoked mixed response in the state on Wednesday. Barring a few incidents of minor clashes and road blockades in Patna and some other places in Sitamarhi and Bettiah, the bandh passed off peacefully.

The protesters blocked Ashok Rajpath between Sabzibagh and PMCH and connecting lanes for several hours. Vehicles had to be diverted to Khazanchi Road and towards Macchua Toli, leading to massive jams before the blockade was lifted after several hours.

Hindustani Awam Mocha (Secular) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi, former Union minister and RLSP president Upendra Kushwaha , Jantantrik Adhikar Party (Loktantrik) members led former MP Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav, CPI-ML’s Dhirendra Jha, CPM’s Arun Kumar Mishra and CPI’s Vijay Narayan Mishra joined the protests at Dakbungalow roundabout and disrupted traffic movement. Police resorted to minor lathicharge to clear the roundabout.

Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said some protesters were detained at Kotwali and Pirbahore police stations but there was no report of violence from anywhere in the district.

In Nalanda, shops and business establishments, private educational institutions in certain localities remained partially closed but vehicular traffic remained almost unaffected. The 24X7 sit-ins by women against CAA, NPR and NRC continued in ten localities at Biharsharif. Addressing a gathering there, CPI (ML) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya said chief minister Nitish Kumar should not confuse people by making opportunistic statements on CAA, NPR and NRC.

Prompt police action prevented the ongoing stir from turning ugly when unruly elements tried to forcibly close down shops at the busy Meena Bazar in Bettiah. Shopkeepers opposed the agitators, who tried to forcefully close the market, which soon turned into a battleground. A brickbat from both sides made the situation explosive. However, Bettiah SP Nitasha Gudiya rushed to the spot and led a baton charge to chase away the violent mob. West Champaran DM Nilesh Ramchandra Deore also reached the market.

The bandh had a mixed response at Bagaha, Valmikinagar and Ramnagar. Roads at Bettiah Chhavani were blocked. Three persons were detained in Bettiah as precautionary measures.

In Khagaria, schools, colleges, government offices, shops and business establishments remained open. But hundreds of people of Marar village continued their indefinite dharna since January 27 in protest against the CAA, NRC and NPR.

Bandh supporters disrupted traffic at several points in Gaya. They entered some colleges and got the classrooms emptied. Buses kept off roads in most parts of the district.

In Ara, the main vegetable and fruit market was closed. CPI(ML) town secretary Dilraj Pritam said party workers blocked the Ara-Patna main road near the bus stand from 10am to 12 noon. JAP workers blocked the Ara-Patna road near Dharhara. The Ara-Mohania road was also blocked for some time by Bahujan Krantikari Morcha .

Bhagalpur and Banka districts had a mixed response to the bandh. People from minority community staged dharna at some places while trade unions associated with Left parties took out a procession. Bandh supporters had heated arguments with those who wanted to keep their shops open. Traffic was disrupted at Champanala bridge.

In Begusarai district, traffic was paralysed on NH-31 and between Barauni Zero Mile and railway station for several hours. However, markets, schools and colleges remained open.

The bandh passed off peacefully in Sitamarhi baring a few stray incidents. At Bhaur, protesters and CAA supporters had a fight but the administration tackled the situation.

The bandh had little impact in East Champaran. The protesters blocked the roads at several places but the blockade was lifted soon. Most of the shops in Motihari, Raxaul, Chakiya and Areraj were open. Traffic on NH-28 and 28A was normal. Road blockades were reported from Ramgarhwa, Turkaulia and Chakiya. A rally was taken out in Chakiya market. CAA supporters clashed with protesters at Dhaka and Motihari.

Representative image

KOLKATA: Plug-and-play stalls will feature for the first time at the Credai-Bengal Home Front 2020 in association with The Times of India. Also, nearly 85% of the properties showcased at the fair will be in the affordable segment, unlike the edition in 2019, when around 60% properties were in the low-cost bracket. Real estate companies are firming up incentives, including discounts on spot bookings, to drive up sales.

“Real estate companies showcasing their projects at the ninth edition of the event will simply be required to plug in, instead of setting up the entire stall from scratch. We are doing this to make participation at the fair cost-effective during a difficult time,” said Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (Credai) Bengal chapter president Nandu Belani .

While most of the projects that will be showcased are located in the peripheral areas of Kolkata or in the suburbs, there will be select city-based offerings in the middle-income and high-income categories. In the first half of last year, only 627 units were launched. In the second half, however, a whopping 5,027 units were launched.

A study by international property consultant Knight Frank , released earlier this month, pointed out how apartment size in Kolkata had shrunk 11% in the past five years to fit the buyers’ pocket.

“We expect the fair to catalyse sales after three years of slowdown. All eyes are on the Budget where key announcements, including one-time restructuring of loans to the real estate sector, can kick start development of many stressed projects,” Belani added.

Sales have declined from 15,000-16,000 units per annum three years ago to around 12,000 units last year. Though sales went down by 12% year-on-year from 12,731 units in 2018 to 11,266 units in 2019, sales in the second half of 2019 was 9% higher than that recorded in the corresponding period of the previous year.

Credai West Bengal chapter president Sushil Mohta said he expected sales to be back on track and inch upwards.

The fair, from January 31 to February 2 at Netaji Indoor Stadium, will feature 47 stalls, covering a total exhibition area of 1,100sqm.

83,['30/01/2020'],"Basant Panchami: Spring in their step, they call for unity","The colour becomes a symbol of peace and love on Basant Panchami

NEW DELHI: Every year when the winter begins its retreat, Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya’s dargah dons the colour of spring — yellow mustard seeds, sunflowers and marigolds — to celebrate Basant Panchami.The festival, which was observed across India on Wednesday, is a trademark of the 13th century mausoleum. Thousands of men and women cutting across religious and caste lines poured into the dargah through the day. Their turbans, scarves and veils are all shades of yellow, the colour of the energy-giving sun. On this day, however, their bright clothes also become a symbol of peace, syncretism and love.According to historian Rana Safvi, Nizamuddin Auliya was a saint of the Chistiya silsila, one of four major Sufi orders in India. His disciple, Persian poet Amir Khusro who is believed to be the originator of Hindustani classical music, first observed the festival to cheer Nizamuddin, who had been grieving over his nephew’s death.“The legend is that after Nizamuddin’s nephew Taqiuddin Nooh passed away, the saint did not smile for months. This disturbed Khusro, who kept looking for ways to make his teacher smile. One day he saw some women, dressed in bright yellow clothes, singing their heart out. They were observing the arrival of spring. So, he dressed in yellow clothes and accompanied by the women, approached Nizamuddin, who smiled at his disciple’s new guise,” said Sayyed Farid Nizami, who is believed to be a descendent of the Sufi saint, and is currently a member of the dargah committee.He added that since then the festival has been observed every year at the dargah. On Wednesday, soon after the sound of the afternoon azan faded away, the music of the qawwals filled the mausoleum. The purbi dialect was apparent as Sufi singers broke into a song about the arrival of spring.“Aaj basant manaaley suhagan, anjan manjan kar piya mori, lambey beher lagaye. Shaah-e Amir tohey dekhan ko (Rejoice, my love rejoice for the spring is here. Decorate your long hair. The king, Amir Khusro, is here to look at you),” sang the qawwals.Visitors told TOI that the celebration represents the “composite culture” of Delhi. “Our country is full of examples of communal harmony. The love between people has existed for centuries. There are Muslim artisans who make idols of Hindu gods and goddesses. People from all faiths visit the dargah. Sufi Basant is testimony to this love,” said Ranit, a visitor.However, the dargah committee is also acutely aware of religious polarisation, which has threated the fabric of the country. “We know that there is a law that has threatened the Ganga-Jamuna tehzeeb that this shrine has come to represent. We would like to tell people who divide to come here for a lesson in peace. We will pray that we remain together as a country,” said Sayyed Naeem Nizami, another member of the committee.In Video: Basant Panchami: ‘Sufi Basant’ festival celebrated at Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73758476,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-708017,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/spring-in-their-step-they-call-for-unity/articleshow/73747049.cms

A senior bureaucrat told TOI that the report was “inconclusive”, though it mentioned a “massive cost escalation” as a consequence of shifting the depot.

“The government is likely to grant a two-week extension to the panel [led by additional chief secretary (finance) Manoj Saunik] for submitting the final report. After that, CM Uddhav Thackeray will take a call on the Metro 3 depot’s location,” the bureaucrat said.

Environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray said the panel’s recommendations “are not binding”. “A final decision will be taken only after studying the report, which has not yet been fully submitted,” he said.

The panel studied two more locations, said the bureaucrat TOI spoke to. “It felt that if the depot is shifted from its present location, Aarey, it will result in a massive cost escalation, not to mention a time overrun,” he said.

85,['30/01/2020'],Contractor turns thief on trains to repay debts,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Nagpur: Tulsidas Rathod, 30, was a private contractor with a well-known cement factory at Chandrapur and also taluka president of the youth wing of a political party at Gondpipri before allegedly taking to stealing laptops and mobile phones from air-conditioned coaches of long-distance trains since about a year-and-half. It was losses in gambling that made Rathod run up huge debts and turn to being a petty thief to pay them off.

Rathod was arrested on Tuesday from a tea stall near Ballarshah railway station by a squad of Government Railway Police (GRP), Nagpur, following a tip-off. Five mobile phones, three laptops and Rs 10,000 cash were seized from him by GRP Local Crime Branch (LCB) team of PI Ghansham Walap under supervision of SP Vishwa Pansare. Five offences registered with Wardha GRP have been so far detected through custodial interrogation and post-arrest probe.

Rathod, son of a teacher, was learnt to be earning more than Rs 10,000 per day as a labour contractor with the cement company. His wife is a nurse. Though a native of Sirpur in Telangana, his family had shifted to Gadchandur in Chandrapur district. As his downfall started, he even sold his wife’s mangalsutra. His baby boy too had died.

Police said as debts mounted beyond Rs 10-12 lakh due to his relentless loss in online lotteries, Rathod started staying away from his family and spent most of the time travelling unauthorisedly in second AC coaches of long distance trains like GT Express and Telangana express by bribing railway personnel.

Police said Rathod would board the train at Kagaznagar in Telangana in night and get off at Ballarshah early in the morning. He would mostly prefer second AC in which well-off passengers travel with laptops and mobile phones. Rathod would steal the devices kept for charging when he saw passengers dozed off.

LCB team comprising head constable Deepak Dorlikar, police naiks Ravindra Saoji, Prashant Saoji, constables Vinod Khobragade, Sandeep Lahase and others started trailing Rathod after he stole a laptop of a senior official of Western Coalfields Ltd (WCL) on January 20 from GT Express.

Police said Rathod would mortgage the stolen properties with owners of the lottery centres where he had lost substantial money and wanted more credits to play more. Nagpur GRP is learnt to have handed over Rathod to their Wardha counterparts for further investigation.

86,['30/01/2020'],"Do not close AFT, ex-MP urges Shah","This story is from January 30, 2020

Puducherry: Former Lok Sabha member M Ramadass has urged Union home minister Amit Shah not to close the 135-year-old Anglo-French Textile ( AFT ) mills runby a government corporation in the Union territory of Puducherry.

In a memorandum to Shah, he outlined the modalities to revive the mill and run it profitably.

He said the five textile and textile-related mills in the government and cooperative sector in Puducherry viz., Jayaprakash Narayana Mills in Karaikal, Spinco, Swadeshi, Bharathi and AFT should be integrated under one corporation with an associated cotton farm at Karaikal under the supervision of the government-society-run agriculture college at Karaikal.

“This unified set up would produce tremendous horizontal and vertical economies between these units and reduce the present cost of production of all mills, including AFT, by 50%. The availability of vast educated, skilled and technically trained young cheap labour force in Puducherry would be an asset to the mill,” he said.

He said the government should rope in a team of textile, management and engineering experts to run the mill giving them a free hand without interfering in the administration but confining only to formulating policies.

He pointed out that when the then proprietor of the mill closed it in 1984, the Union government took possession of it and then handed it over to the Puducherry government.

“A similar step is required now also. Your good self may depute a team of five textile experts from the Union textile ministry or the National Textile Corporation (NTC) to study, analyze and evaluate the existing condition of the infrastructure and other opportunities of the mill and to prepare a comprehensive plan for revival, restructuring and reform in short-run and a plan for expansion and modernization in the long-run. The plan may be submitted to the textile ministry to receive necessary finance to implement the plans in the future,” he said.

Ramadass said AFT made profits for several years.

The mill, when the then chief secretary P M Nair served as its managing director, made profits that enabled him to acquire 22.51 hectares of land at Pattanur in Tamil Nadu.

The property is worth more than Rs 70 crore.

“AFT is perhaps one of the finest integrated large mills in India with all operations of manufacturing of cloth, namely spinning, weaving, dyeing, processing, warping, warehousing and drawing etc. are carried under one roof. Even today all the machines required to operate the mill and produce cloth are available in working condition and if the mill is reopened today, we can commence production the next week,” he said.

VARANASI: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath appealed to people of Vindhyachal to extend cooperation in developing the Vindhya Corridor and play an active role in making Ganga pollution-free by extending support to Namami Gange campaign of PM Modi. Yogi was addressing a public meeting at the Government Inter College ground in Mirzapur on Wednesday as part of the Ganga Yatra. He also laid foundation of state’s first ‘go-abhayaranya’ ( cow sanctuary ) and offered prayers at the Vindhyachal temple.

Yogi said developing the shrine was everybody’s responsibility. “We are not just planning development of Vindhyachal Dham by introducing world-class facilities, we will develop the entire Vindhya range,” he said.

Yogi also stated when the pilgrimage site will be a big tourist draw, most problems would be solved. He recalled PM’s gift of a mega solar power plant with French collaboration in Mirzapur.

“People have begun understanding why Modi said in 2014 that ‘Ma Ganga ne bulaya hai’ (I have been called by Mother Ganga). The Namami Gange project became a reality due to efforts of PM Modi. The PM instilled confidence among the people that Ganga can become clean,” he said.

Ganga invokes faith, but also keeps afloat our economy, he said. “After putting a check on industrial waste flowing into the Ganga from Sisamau, the biggest drain in Kanpur, which was causing maximum pollution, efforts are now being made to reach every village and town along it to mobilise people to ensure no pollutant is disposed in the river,” he said.

“When the PM is determined to make Ganga pollution-free, it becomes responsibility of all to contribute in this campaign.” He said the government is working hard to revive organic farming, developing ponds, sports ground and parks along the river.

Earlier, the CM laid the foundation of ‘go-abhayaranya’ to be developed on 27 bigha in Halia block of the district. It will be first sanctuary in which cows will be left free to graze. He also announced that projects of Rs 6000 crore have been sanctioned for overall development of Vindhya region, including neighbouring Sonbhadra district.

VELLORE: Tension prevailed at Veerangkuppam near Ambur in Tirupattur district after police were forced to resort to a mild lathicharge to disperse a huge crowd that had gathered to watch a bull race in the village on Wednesday.

As part of the celebrations for the Samundeswari temple festival in the village, an annual bull race is held in the village. To celebrate the temple’s 178th year festival, a bull race was organised after the temple authorities obtained permission from the Tirupattur district police.

Raghavan, a villager, said, “Every year, an average of 150 bulls used to participate in the race and a crowd of around 1,500 people used to gather to witness the race. Unexpectedly, for Wednesday’s event, more than 500 bulls participated and 5,000 people thronged the village. Unable to control the crowd and to avert untoward incidents, police were forced to resort to a lathicharge to disperse the crowd.”

A police officer said the bull race was planned to be held at Veerangkuppam in Tirupattur district and Serpadi in Vellore district. Due to a death in Serpadi, the bull race was deferred there. To avoid disappointing the crowds, bulls that were scheduled to participate in the Serpadi race were brought to Veerangkuppam. As many as 100 police personnel headed by Ambur DSP C K Sachidhanandham who could not control the crowd resorted to lathi charge, he said.

90,['30/01/2020'],Posers on wish to get Tata Dam water for dist,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Pune: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’s proposal to seek 10 TMC water from Tata Dam for the district may not materialise because it would affect the areas under Mumbai and Konkan divisions, stressed senior officials of the irrigation department.

The diversion of water would affect the hydropower generation and lead to violation of the Krishna Water Dispute Tribunal norms, set for Maharashtra and three neighbouring states — Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana — on the water allocation from the Krishna river basin, the officials claimed.

The Tata Dam gets 42.5 TMC water from Mulshi, Shirwata, Walvhan, Lonavala, Thokarwadi and Kundli to feed three power houses — Bhira, Khopoli and Bhivpuri — for generating 447MW electricity for the Mumbai region.

After the Pune municipal commissioner sought allocation of a separate dam to meet the city’s water needs, the deputy chief minister had said on Monday there was no space to construct any new dams. He also said he would request Tata Dam to divert water for the city and rural areas in the district, as was done earlier in 2015.

The irrigation department officials stressed that the diversion of water from Tata Dam would not be in the interest of the state in view of the tribunal restrictions and the technical importance of hydropower generation. “The diversion of 10 TMC water will mean non-availability of peak power to the commercial capital of India,” said an official.

The Krishna Water Dispute Tribunal distributed the water available in Krishna Basin between Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telengana. Maharashtra’s share is 25%. Tata and Koyna were then allowed to divert the east-flowing water to the west side for power generation.

“If any water is made available to Bhima basin from Tata Dam, the other states will claim their rights on it,” he said.

Last year in May, a study committee comprising former secretaries from the water resources department had clearly stated that water of the Tata Dam cannot be reduced because this water use is protected by the tribunal equivalent to the Supreme Court of India.

“The Central Electricity Authority suggested installation of PSPs (pumped storage units) in the western ghats. These PSPs run in pump and generator modes. When excess power from solar plants is available in daytime, water from Konkan region can be pumped and stored in upper Bhima basin in the existing dams and later it can be used to generate electricity,” said an expert.

HYDERABAD: In a far-reaching initiative, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) is planning to complete GIS mapping in over 5,000 km of sewerage network spread across the city by March this year.A senior Water Board official said the GIS mapping was taken up in a phased manner. “In the first phase, survey of the sewerage network in the core area of Hyderabad (erstwhile MCH) has been completed. Our officials have evaluated it. Survey of sewage network in GHMC peripheral circles is going on now,” he told TOI.Presently, the Water Board staffers cannot reach a spot to solve a sewage-related problem if it is a narrow and small bylane. “Thanks to GIS mapping, we can ensure a reliable network reach the spot with pinpoint accuracy and resolve the issue even in a narrow lane,” said a senior official.Under GIS mapping, a web application will also be developed. Sources said the Water Board will also launch an exclusive mobile app to track sewerage network and NGOs will be imparted training to operate the app. “They can keep track of sewerage network-related problems and alert the officials concerned,” explained the official.Officials said efforts are being made to link the existing sewerage network with GIS mapping in core city area. The decision to utilise the technology was taken after officials realised the futility of manual operations to track overflow of sewer water in residential colonies, sources said. “Just one click is enough to track overflow of sewer water from command and control centre run by the Water Board,” the officials said.Sources said the board requisitioned the services of 30 engineering graduates and half a dozen retired engineering officials. “We have roped in those engineers who have expertise in handling sewerage network-related issues,” an official said.Sources said the board is also planning to extend GIS mapping to water supply network.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73752349,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-502515,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gis-mapping-of-5000-km-sewage-network-by-march/articleshow/73744009.cms

Kiran Bedi

PUDUCHERRY: Lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi regretted that the Puducherry government has not taken any concrete efforts to notify the amended Motor Vehicle Act in the Union territory despite the Centre’s directions.

Bedi in a WhatsApp post said revenue minister M O H F Shahjahan, who holds the portfolio of transport, has been withholding the file on the notification of the amended act for the past several months.

She said the secretary concerned approached the minister several times urging him to clear the file with his decision.

However, the minister has not cleared it so far. She requested the minister to take a decision in the interest of road safety.

“...in case it’s difficult to decide please forward the file with whatever the Hon’ble Minister believes so that a lawful decision can be arrived at and not leave the matter of such enforcement in limbo, which it is at the moment. It’s not safe to leave such important decisions pending on road safety in limbo indefinitely. It would have been in fitness that this notification had been done and the (road safety) week observance used to announce and educate,” she said.

She regretted that ministers do not make a decision and clear the files in a time-bound manner.

Bedi said observing road safety week will be meaningless unless all aspects are in place and the officers on duty evolve a clear plan of action and enforcement.

“Notification (of amended MV act) is pending for the past several months, which is an embarrassment for the UT. As it ought not to have taken so long since the GOI so directed these to be finalised. This has left enforcing officers confused. And enforcement has dwindled and declined which is not good for road safety. So, what are we observing? Without proper and comprehensive enforcement of even helmet wearing. In the past when such movements picked up it was thwarted by vested interests by stamping on the helmets publicly,” she said.

Pune: A member of an interstate gang of robbers was arrested from Gujarat on Tuesday on the charge of robbing a 71-year-old trader of cash and gold ornaments, collectively worth Rs 6.8 lakh, in Pimpri on December 25 last year.

The police recovered gold ornaments worth Rs2 lakh from him. The suspect, Rohit alias Kalu Dalpat Ghamande (30) of Ahmedabad, has cases registered against him in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Telangana, Aurangabad and Pimpri, an officer said. Four of his accomplices were on the run.

Probe revealed that a day before robbing trader Ravi Mehta, the gang had picked up a fight with an SUV driver before fleeing with his bag containing Rs3 lakh. “Ghamande is in police custody till February 1,” Pimpri Chinchwd police additional commissioner Ramnath Pokale said.

Mehta, who is from Amritsar, supplies gold ornaments to jewellers across the country. Before coming to Pune on December 23, Mehta was in Ahmedabad. “Ghamande and his gang members received a tip-off about Mehta and followed him from Ahmedabad,” inspector Uttam Tangade of crime branch said.

Mehta was staying at a lodge in Pimpri. “On December 25, when Mehta was on his way to Babasaheb Ambedkar Chowk, Ghamande and his aides snatched his bag.”

The Pimpri Chinchwad police crime branch checked the CCTV footage and got the suspects’ images. “We shared the images on different groups in the country. We got to know that the gang was from Ahmedabad,” assistant commissioner of police (crime) RR Patil said. The crime branch team alerted informers in Ahmedabad and shared with their Gujarat counterparts the suspects’ photographs. The team was in Ahmedabad for five days before taking Ghamande in custody.

94,['30/01/2020'],"Finally, Thelineer spills out of KWA’s cup","This story is from January 30, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Despite recent controversies, there is no change in the decision to hand over the Kerala Water Authority (KWA)’s ambitious drinking water project, ‘Thelineer’ to the Kerala Irrigation Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (KIIDC).

At a meeting convened by water resources minister K Krishnankutty on Wednesday, it has been agreed upon to accept the KWA board’s decision to hand over the project to KIIDC. KIIDC, which is already producing and marketing drinking water under the brand name ‘Hilly Aqua’ will market the drinking water under the same brand name.

The KWA, which has already spent Rs 16 crore of its plan fund for the project, will have to be satisfied with the lease amount for land and cost of water provided for the plant. “The crisis-ridden KWA used its plan fund of Rs 16 crore on the plant. Earlier, there was an agreement to share revenue with KWA. Now, KWA will be paid only the lease amount for land and price of water in industrial rate,” sources said.

The project to produce the packaged drinking water was proposed as a major income-generating project for the KWA in 2006-2008.

The Kerala water supply and sewerages act was amended for the project in 2008. The KWA had planned to start bottling water plants in places like Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam and Thrissur.

The project faced several objections, including opposition from the then additional chief secretary Tom Jose, who was against the release of Rs 16 crore to the KWA for the bottling water plant. He had argued that the production of bottling water was not the KWA’s responsibility. Later, LDF government decided to go ahead with the plant.

Sources said it is against the KWA’s interest to hand over the plant to KIIDC, which has not been marketing effectively its own product, Hilly Aqua.

“The KIIDC is producing only half of its original capacity of 3,500 litres per shift. It has been struggling to market Hilly Aqua. KWA had all the possibility to rule the market and generate income from it,” sources said.

The decision to hand over the project was made after the KWA proposed to the government to recruit staff for running and marketing the plant. Work of the plant, which was in the process of obtaining the final BIS certificate, has now been stalled.

The KIIDC has presented a draft agreement at the meeting held on Wednesday. However, the government has not given a deadline over commissioning of the plant, which will push the project into uncertainty. The KWA had proposed to set up a bottling water plant with a capacity of 7,200 litres per day. It planned to market water in 500 ml, 1 litre, 2 litre and 20 litre bottles.

Pune: Security measures are being beefed up on the Bhimashankar temple premises and surrounding areas as a part of the Rs148 crore development plan.

Officials from the district administration told TOI that soon there would be restrictions to prevent private vehicles beyond the parking area during festivals like Mahashivratri and the month of Shravan.

Private vehicles will be banned beyond the parking area, which is located 7-8 km away from the temple, during festivals from July. Tourists will have to use the free-of-cost midi bus service from the parking area to reach the temple. Currently, private vehicles can go up to the temple.

The construction of a police station in the area is also underway. The facility if expected to help manage crowds during festivals. The entire area, from the bus stand to the temple, will also be under CCTV surveillance. Development works worth Rs7.51 crore have been completed in Bhimashankar as part of the plan while works worth Rs37 crore are currently being undertaken.

An official from the district administration said that currently there are around 10 CCTV’s installed in the area, but soon the entire area will be covered. “During festivals, a number of police officers are stationed in and around Bhimashankar temple premises to manage the crowd. However, until now, there was no police station in the area, just a room serving as one,” he said.

According to the official, the police station and parking area is being built outside the sanctuary area. “A few of the 20 midi buses that ply tourists from Pune and other locations to the Bhimashankar temple will be utilized to ply tourists from this parking spot to the temple during crowded festival days. Hence, private vehicles will have to be parked in this parking area. They will not be allowed to go further during such days. Tourists will only be allowed to take midi buses to the temple,” the official said.

Further, an exit road has been built to evacuate people during emergencies. An agency has also been roped up to build and maintain toilets on the temple premises.

Nagpur: Teen sensation Malvika Bansod has been selected in the Indian squad for the Badminton Asian Team Championships. The annual continental championship will be held in Manila from February 11 to 16.

Malvika, 18, is the first city shuttler to play in this event. After Arunadhati Pantawane and Vaishnavi Bhale, Malvika is the third Nagpurian to represent a senior Indian side. According to sources, the Badminton Association of India (BAI) has picked up a 17-member squad which includes eight women players.

In July last year, Malvika had led the national side in the Badminton Asia Junior (U-19) Championships at Suzhou in China. Within six months, she has got a call into the senior side.

Tournaments in Bengaluru (January 7 to 12) and Goa (January 14 to 19) were the selection trials for the Indian team. Malvika lost in the pre-quarters in Bengaluru and finished runner-up in Goa, losing narrowly to Assam’s Ashmita Chaliha.

The 12 participating teams are clubbed in four groups. In Group X, India take on Kazakhstan first and then Korea.

“It’s a dream come true for me. It will be a great learning experience to play at this level,” Malvika told TOI on Wednesday.

Malvika is now ranked a career-best No. 167 in the world. “I have worked very hard to give consistent performances without a break in the junior, senior and international competitions for the entire last year,” she added.

A Standard XII student of Shivaji Science College, Malvika said that reaching the Goa final was the turning point. “After the Bengaluru result, I was very disappointed. Even skipping Goa crossed my mind. I was not completely fit also,” she said.

However, Malvika took a few days’ break which helped her recuperate. “I told myself to perform to the best of my ability. I played really well and even the scores in the final were impressive,” she said.

Currently ranked India No. 2 in the women’s singles, Malvika, who is coached by Sanjay Mishra, is supported by Vishvaraj Infrastructure Ltd with a five-year sponsorship deal. She was also thankful to MBA president Arun Lakhani, NDBA secretary Mangesh Kashikar and Shivaji Science College management.

For the last few months, Malvika has been shuttling between Raipur and Nagpur for training. “When Malvika played the final at Goa, I was confident that she will make the cut. Almost all the eight selected players have just entered the senior category. They are the future of Indian badminton. It will be good exposure for them,” said Mishra, who is also the chief junior national coach.

Representative image

PUNE: A total of 227 schools , including 27 from the city, have registered in the state since January 22 for admitting students under the 25% reserved quota as per the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

The total intake of students under the RTE Act in the 227 schools registered so far is 3,698. The registration of schools began on January 22 and will go on till February 6. Last year, as many as 9,195 schools in the state participated in the admission under the RTE Act and 1.16 lakh seats were reserved.

Dinkar Temkar, joint director of education and RTE in-charge in Maharashtra, said, “The registrations will happen as expected. There is still a week to close the registrations and schools will take it up. We have also sent reminders to them.” The system will also auto-forward some of the schools who have to conduct the admission under the RTE compulsorily.

This year onwards, the RTE admission process will have many changes — from number of rounds to an early conclusion of the entire process. There will be just one lottery round instead of four. The process would be over by the end of May so that the students can join the schools on the first day of the academic year in June. The students can start filling applications from February 11. The lottery would be held on March 11 and 12.

Temkar said, “The schools have been told to update the vacancy data in the Saral portal and the new schools that have entered the system will have to register for the admissions under the RTE Act in the given period.”

99,['30/01/2020'],"No bidders for e-buses, NMC seeks extension of deadline","This story is from January 30, 2020

Nagpur: For the second consecutive time, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s transport department has found no bidders for supplying 40 electric buses, sanctioned by the central government last year.

The NMC has already missed two deadlines. “Now, we have sought another extension till February 29,” said an official.

In August 2019, the department of heavy industries and public enterprises had sanctioned 100 electric buses for NMC under Phase-II of faster adoption and manufacturing of electric vehicles (FAME) in India.

Unable to deal with its present financial crisis, the NMC had reduced its sanction by 60 buses and instead sought to procure 40 e-buses only.

In a letter to joint secretary, department of heavy industries, the NMC’s transport manager and deputy municipal commissioner Rajesh Mohite has requested the central government to extend the deadline to February 29.

In its letter to the NMC, the government had set some conditions including adhering to the deadline to procure or supply the e-buses. The first deadline was December 15, 2019. The NMC missed it and subsequently it missed the first extended deadline of January 15, 2020, too.

As per the procurement procedure, there should be at least three bids for technical and financial evaluation. “During the first bid, only one party had shown interest, while in the second, no one participated,” said the officer.

“Therefore, the NMC will have to re-tender the process, which will take nearly a month. In view of this, we have demanded further extension till February 29,” he said.

Sources, however, said the civic administration is not interested in procuring the e-buses as it will increase the viability gap funding of running the Aapli Bus service. Currently, the NMC is running a fleet of 370 buses, including 5 women-only electric vehicles, and spends around Rs13 crore per month. In return, the service generates around Rs6 crore only from bus fares, leaving a shortfall of Rs7 crore. With the induction of 40 e-buses, NMC’s monthly expenditure will increase by almost Rs85 lakh.

100,['30/01/2020'],Riders loving clean stations and sights of Aqua Line Metro,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Nagpur: “Tula disat aahe ka Ambazari lake,” (Can you see the Ambazari lake) a 20-something guy on video call hollered into his phone on board Lokmanya Nagar-bound Aqua Line Metro as it passed through the historic water body. He was not alone. Other passengers too were equally excited travelling on the Aqua Line on Wednesday. Passengers were taking selfies and admiring the top-class infrastructure at stations. They particularly liked the view of Ambazari Lake.

MahaMetro commenced commercial operations on Reach 3 between Lokmanya Nagar Metro Station on Hingna Road and Sitabuldi Interchange on Tuesday, offering seamless connectivity from Hingna to rest of the city. Jayashree Rajdeo, a senior citizen boarded Metro from Jaiprakash Nagar station and changed trains at Sitabuldi for Lokmanya Nagar to experience the interchanging facility. “I was very excited to experience the ride. Aqua Line has connected distant places successfully,” she said.

As soon as the Metro arrived at the platform at Sitabuldi, passengers couldn’t contain their excitement and took out their mobile phones to take pictures. The photo session lasted for good eight minutes until the doors opened to board.

Bhushan Kotasthane, a government employee, also availed the interchange facility by boarding Metro at Khapri and changing for Jhansi Rani Chowk. “Interchange stations are convenient to use and save a lot of time. Metro is cost effective and efficient way of travelling,” he said.

Aqua Line is also helping students save that extra penny as this route touches Saraswati Vidayalaya, Dharampeth College, and further up NKP Salve Institute of Medical Sciences, Raisoni and Priyadarshini engineering colleges and many more. “This is my first day experiencing the metro service and I am blown away by how massive and well-made the station is. I stay in a nearby hostel and will be accessing this route regularly from Sitabuldi,” said Shreyash Yedke, a student. Sharing thoughts about the interchange facility, Diptanshu Sawai, another student said, ‘Purpose of public transport is to be efficient and hassle-free and merging orange and blue line is an example of it.”

Passengers said Metro should begin operations around 6am so people from Khapri and nearby areas can use it to come to city. Same is true for those going to or coming from airport. “Some people leave for work or school early, some have to catch early morning flights. Otherwise it is very feasible. Personally I get to travel near my college,” said Pranita Mendhe, a teacher at NKPSIMS.

Being the first full day of commercial operations, the footfalls were not much. But quite a few people had come just to experience the ride with friends and family at Sitabuldi. “We bunked office and landed here because of the excitement. I wish staff here was more polite and greeted us,” said Poonam Godhi, a private sector employee.

Passengers were all praise for well-maintained stations but some complained there were no chairs for those waiting for trains, especially since waiting time can be half an hour. “The station is spic and span. Now I can say proudly I live in a metro city. Nagpur is reaching greater heights,” said Jyoti Mishra, an employee with Wipro.

Mayur Bharve, a student, said, “I traveled by auto in the morning to reach my college Priyadarshini Institute but I am now taking metro to reach home via Lokmanya Nagar to Sitabuldi.”

101,['30/01/2020'],Wrong side drivers to lose license,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Vadodara: It’s going to be hot this year for drivers caught on the wrong side of the lane. So, before you try to cut short a long turn, beware that your wrong move may cost you your licence to drive!

The police department has decided to focus on those driving on the wrong side of the road as it puts lives of other commuters at risk too, said city police commissioner Anupam Singh Gahlaut.

“We will cancel driving license of those caught driving on the wrong side of the road. It is one of the major causes of accidents besides creating nuisance on the roads. Commuters have to follow the traffic rules, or else face strict disciplinary action. We took this decision in a recent meet for traffic safety,” Gahlaut told TOI.

The top cop also said that in 2019 they had recommended suspending driving licenses of hundreds of commuters who were caught driving on wrong side and this year it will be implemented even more strictly.

The police have also involved the regional transport office (RTO) in the drive to make roads even safer. The RTO has issued notices to the commuters who were issued e-challans for driving on the wrong side.

“The second priority is to crack down on commuters talking over mobile phone while driving. The third is to keep commuters behind the stop line at traffic signals. The fourth is to ensure that people don’t park vehicles in no-parking zones,” Gahlaut added.

Gahlaut said that citizens who haven’t paid dues for more than 15 e-challans too stand to lose their driving licenses.

“There are large number of citizens who have been issued more than 15 e-challans for different traffic offences. Many of them haven’t paid the penalty. We have now written to the RTO to suspend their driving license for six months,” he said. And, if any of them is caught flouting any traffic rule again, his or her driving licence will be cancelled.

The police said that enforcing traffic rules strictly is the need of the hour especially after people are seen driving rashly on city roads unmindful about e-challans or penalties.

102,['30/01/2020'],"Jahangirpuri double murder: Woman, son killed for Rs 6 lakh","This story is from January 30, 2020

The decomposed bodies of Pooja and Harshit were found after five days.

NEW DELHI: A 35-year-old woman and her 13-year-old son, who were murdered at their house in Jahangirpuri on January 16, were killed by a couple for around Rs 6 lakh.

Pooja had kept the money at home to buy a new house, about which the accused woman, Meenakshi, was aware of. The deceased’s family knew the accused as Pooja was helping Meenakshi in finding a job in Delhi. The accused, Meenakshi, and her husband, Pradeep, stayed in Rohtak.

On the day of the incident, Meenakshi met the deceased woman for lunch at her house and engaged her in conversation. At the same time, her husband entered Pooja’s house. Later, the couple stabbed her to death. They even murdered her son, thinking that he might spill the beans before the cops. TOI had first reported about the arrests on Wednesday.

Vijayanta Arya, deputy commissioner of police, Northwest, said: “An autopsy of the deceased woman revealed that she had her lunch before she was murdered. Meenakshi had also left her residence at the same time, which brought her role under the scanner. Also, she was the one who had seen the deceased alive last.”

The decomposed bodies of Pooja and Harshit were recovered from their residence in K Block of Jahangirpuri on January 21. While Pooja was found naked on the floor with a stab wound on her back, her son was found in the other room with his throat slit.

Investigations revealed that Meenakshi was present at her residence on that day. She had left the house a few minutes after Pooja was murdered. The CCTV footage also showed the movement of a person, who was later identified as Pradeep, towards Pooja’s house. On finding all these clues, it did not take much time for the cops to connect the dots.

Pradeep was unwell and stayed at Rohtak. His wife Meenakshi would visit Delhi in search of jobs to fund her husband’s medical expenses. Pooja had promised to help her get a job in an NGO and the two would meet often.

Further police probe revealed that before the murder, Meenakshi asked Pradeep to make intimate relations with Pooja so that she could be taken to another room. Pradeep then stabbed the woman with a knife on her back and took her phone along. Since the child knew Meenakshi, the couple eliminated him as well. They first strangled him and later slit his throat.

“We have recovered the knife, bloodstained clothes of the accused and the deceased, robbed jewellery items and Rs 5.17 lakh, and the motorcycle used to commit the crime,” added Arya.

National vice-president Prashant Kishor (Left) and national general secretary Pavan K Varma

PATNA: JD (U) on Wednesday expelled its national vice-president Prashant Kishor and national general secretary Pavan K Varma for “violating organisational discipline” by making “controversial statements against the party’s official line”.

For quite some time, Kishor and Varma had been publicly criticizing JD(U) and its president Nitish Kumar for supporting the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ) and the National Population Register ( NPR ). Earlier this week, the differences between JD(U) and the two now expelled leaders snowballed into serious personal feud with Nitish, who has been chief minister of Bihar since 2005.

Announcing the sacking of Kishor and Varma, JD(U) national secretary general K C Tyagi, in a statement, said, “Despite being a functionary of the JD(U), Prashant Kishor issued several controversial statements in the last few weeks, which were against the party’s decision and were indicative of his autocratic behaviour.”

Tyagi added, “Our national president (Nitish) honoured him (Kishor) after he joined the party, but he used his position to further his individual pursuits. Kishor also used insulting words for the party’s national president. It is imperative that Kishor be removed from the party, so that he doesn’t fall any lower.”

Within minutes of his expulsion, Kishor tweeted, “Thank you Nitish Kumar. My best wishes to you to retain the chair of Chief Minister of Bihar. God bless you.”

Regarding Varma, Tyagi said, “Nitish Kumar gave more honour to Pavan Varma than he deserved. Making a letter to the party president public and revealing certain private talks in the letter show that party discipline was not a priority for Varma. JD (U) runs on collective responsibility, but some people start believing that the party runs on their ideology.”

Varma, in a sarcastic tweet posted about an hour after his sacking from the party, said, “Thank you Nitish Kumar ji for freeing me from my increasingly untenable position of defending you and your policies. I wish you well in your ambition of being CM of Bihar at any cost.”

Earlier in the day, JD-U functionary Ajay Alok attacked Kishor calling him “coronavirus”. He said, “He (Kishor) works for AAP, talks to Rahul Gandhi, sits with Mamata didi. Who will trust him? We are happy this ‘coronavirus’ is leaving us…he can go wherever he wants.” He added, “He (Kishor) could not win the trust of either Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Nitish Kumar. He is not a trustworthy person.”

Madannapet police on Wednesday launched a manhunt to nab the unidentified robbers.

Sabrata Samanta, 26, who works in the gold workshop of his brother-in-law Shyamlal at Chelapura near Charminar, went to another gold workshop in Ghansi Bazar on Tuesday morning and handed over some ornaments for cutting and moulding. “In the evening, he collected the gold from Ghansi Bazar and was on his way to Chelapura when the duo riding a scooter intercepted him near Kokarwadi,” Madannapet deputy inspector P Bharath Kumar said.

One of them took control of Sabrata’s scooter along with gold and forced him to pillion ride. “The second accused followed them on another scooter,” Bharath said.

After reaching a petrol station at Madannapet, the duo told Sabrata that they have to fill fuel in their scooter. “One of them asked Sabrata to go to the ATM and withdraw cash. When he refused, the accused slapped him. Sabrata withdrew Rs 10,000 and handed it over to one of the accused. After receiving the cash, the duo took Sabrata’s cellphone and fled from the scene. They took away his scooter also,” Bharath said.

A case of robbery was registered.

107,['30/01/2020'],Corporation in a spot of bother over pending civil work bills,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Mounting bills from civil works amounting to nearly Rs 26 crore, coupled with the government’s fund crunch, have pushed the civic body into a spot of bother as the ruling council is finding it hard to convince contractors to take up works before the end of the present fiscal.

Bills are pending for works undertaken as spill-over during 2018-19 and works being executed under plan fund for 2019-20.

The corporation has also fixed February 20 as deadline for completing all road repair works in 31 wards coming under festival zone ahead of Attukal Pongala. Over 800 works have also been tendered under plan fund, which ought to be completed before March.

With bills remaining uncleared, contractors who had taken overdraft from banks to bag multiple works are in two minds whether to take up more works and then wait for payment or should desist from submitting tenders.

The contractors in city corporation had held a meeting recently in which various issues were discussed apart from pending bills. Although the contractors had mulled boycotting works, they have decided to remain co-operative hoping for the bills to be cleared soon.

There have been serious differences over the bill discounting system as well, which is often mooted as a remedy in times of fund crunch. When the bills with treasury remaining uncleared, authorized banks will give 90% of the total bill amount withholding 10% and once fund flow begins from treasury, the banks will be repaid, however it will take the interest on remaining 10%, which will be withheld.

The dispute over sharing of interest remains unresolved. Earlier, the government had forced the contractors to bear the entire interest, later it was fixed as 50:50. The contractors, however, point out that they are already reeling from debts and can't bear to give away any further sum as interest under the bill discounting system and that the government should take care of the interest component as well.

S Pushpalatha, chairperson, works standing committee, said the works on Attukal Pongala will not be affected. “Funds are distributed as Rs 5 lakh each for 30 wards and Rs 10 lakh for one ward. We undertake these works with utmost priority and there shall not be any concerns regarding payment. As for other pending bills, we have had similar situations before also, hopefully we would be able to settle all payments soon,” said Pushpalatha.

Officials with the engineering wing said the matter has been communicated to the state government and that they have got assurance that by February, the local self-government department will receive sufficient funds.

“Besides, we are conducting daily reviews to ensure that a major percentage of bills are ready to be submitted by February itself so that the pendency could be reduced,” said an official with the engineering department.

Vadodara: Heads turned in the walled city areas when an officer wearing police uniform passed through the narrow streets on a brand new white motorcycle fitted with police beacon on Wednesday morning.

Little had the locals expected that the officer would be city police commissioner Anupam Singh Gahlaut. The top cop took a ride of the bike for a good 45 minutes as he visited police chowkies in the old city.

It is for the first time that Gehlot rode on a motorbike in the city. “The idea was to find out if the cops posted in the sensitive areas are alert and are they patrolling in their areas. Usually, when I travel to these areas by my official car, cops posted there become alert. So I decided to drive the police bike and visit some spots in the walled city,” Gahlaut told TOI.

Shops were closed in some walled city areas including Mandvi and Panigate apart from Raopura after the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protestors had announced Bharat Bandh on Wednesday.

Gahlaut started from Police Bhavan and zipped through Lal Court, Nyay Mandir, Fatehpura, Lehripura, Mandvi, Hathikhana, Nagarwada and Salatwada.

“I saw some cops sitting inside police chowky. I told them to be out on the roads and remain visible,” Gahlaut said.

“This ride was also test drive of the bike that has been given to the city police by the state government,” Gahlaut added.

Vadodara: Crime branch sleuths arrested four persons including two traffic brigade personnel from Gotri area on Tuesday night. The police have seized a huge liquor stock, cash and mobile phones from the accused. The cops are now investigating if the accused are involved in more such crimes.

Jayraj and Sanjay told the cops that they were chasing a vehicle carrying liquor stock in the city two days ago.

Driver of that vehicle abandoned the car and fled from the spot following which Sanjay took the car to his home in Khambat taluka, Anand. He offloaded the liquor stock at his home and kept 28 bottles of Indian Made Foreign Liquor with him. “We informed the Khambat police that raided his home and seized 551 liquor bottles worth Rs 1.65 lakh,” Jadeja said.

Police said they may have been taking advantage of their uniform to carry out illegal activities in the city.

Water Vending Machines established in Trichy railway station

TRICHY: Of late, vendors and stalls at the Trichy railway junction have been making a killing out of the sale of packaged drinking water as three of the five water vending machines (WVMs) installed on the platforms have been remaining defunct. Passengers say this is the case in other railway stations in the division too and have appealed to the authorities to make all the WVMs operational.

Railways had entrusted the responsibility of installing WVMs at all major railway stations to Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation (IRCTC). Accordingly, IRCTC installed five such water vending machines at Trichy junction and one each at Thanjavur, Kumbakonam, Mayiladuthurai, Nagapattinam, Ariyalur and Villupuram in December 2016. The then divisional railway manager (DRM), A K Agarwal, commissioned three WVMs in the first phase at Trichy while two more were installed later. At present, there are two machines on platform 1 and three in the remaining ones. However, only one machine on platform 1 and another one on 4 are functioning at present.

“The objective of installing WVMs at stations is to make available potable drinking water of prescribed standard to customers at an affordable price. Passengers were getting pure drinking water for a much lesser price compared to packaged drinking water. But it has not been functioning for months including the one at Kumbakonam station”, said A Giri, the advisor of Thanjavur District Rail Users' Association. Passengers are forced to buy packaged drinking water at a higher price, he said. Though railways has been installing RO plant-backed water taps, he claimed that most of them were also remaining dry.

V B Jaganath, a member of Trichy Intra-City Development Endeavors (Tides), said passengers used to get one litre for Rs 5 (refill) and Rs 8 (with container). Now, they are forced to go to the stalls to get the same for prices ranging from Rs 15 to Rs 17. The railway authorities had spent Rs 23 crore only for cosmetic changes in the name of re-development works but not for basic passenger amenities, he said. “The new arch at the main entrance, refurbishing walls and floors with granites and ACP false ceiling and gardening are needed. But potable drinking water at affordable cost and toilet facilities should get more priority. Water is the main source of contagious diseases. It is important to provide pure drinking water to commuters. The authorities should turn their focus towards passenger basic amenities”, he added.

When contacted, a senior official from commercial department told TOI that all the vending machines are on contract only. The staff are managing them as per the requirement of the platform concerned.

113,['30/01/2020'],‘Split’ in city Cong over NIT dissolution,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Nagpur: The city Congress is a divided house over the fate of local urban development authority — Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT). While a section of party corporators want restoration of the NIT , another section favours scrapping of the agency.

On Wednesday, senior Congress corporator Manoj Sangole met new municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe with a demand to complete the handover of NIT to the NMC. Sangole also demanded that NMC should absorb all NIT employees.

Recently, Nagpur district guardian minister and state energy minister Nitin Raut had written a letter to urban development department to stop the dissolution of NIT and reinstate its powers. The BJP-ruled NMC had convened a meeting to counter Raut’s move.

Sangole was one of the candidates who had filed nomination to contest from North Nagpur constituency in the assembly elections, but later withdrew from the fray and extended support to Raut.

Speaking to TOI, Sangole said that NIT was the most corrupt civic agency. He said most of the layouts in North Nagpur were not developed though residents have paid development charges to the NIT. “Being a corporator from this part of the city, people have expectations from us. NMC could not spend money in layouts under NIT’s jurisdiction. So, it is high time the city should have only one development authority like the NMC,” he said.

Sangole also pointed out that the city has grown area wise and due to patronage of some politicians, illegal housing societies have mushroomed at many places. Now, people residing in these localities are deprived of even basic amenities, he claimed.

Apart from civic issues, the Congress corporator also suggested to implement anti-encroachment drive 24X7.

Sangole also drew the attention of the new civic chief to many possibilities to increase revenue of the civic body and pointed out that despite appointing an agency to provide 24X7 water, none of the areas in the city is receiving round-the-clock supply. “Despite having a clause in the agreement for increasing the revenue, the private firm entrusted with the 24X7 water supply project has made no efforts in this regard,” he said.

He also drew Mundhe’s attention to the loss-making NMC-run Aapli Bus service and illegal weekly and daily markets in residential localities apart from poor property tax collection etc. Streamlining these will help the cash-strapped NMC increase its revenue, said Sangole.

114,['30/01/2020'],Mundhe gets 49 complaints on Day 1 of Janta Darbar,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe

Nagpur: With municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe announcing a Janata Darbar every day between 4pm and 5pm, many residents turned up on the first day to meet him for redressal of their complaints. The civic chief’s office received 49 complaints on various issues, ranging from encroachments to water connections etc.

Mayor Sandip Joshi’s ongoing Janata Darbar at Hanuman Nagar zone heard 40 complaints.

TOI spoke to many residents who met Mundhe to air their grievances, and most of them claimed they have been running pillar to post to get their problems resolved.

Some residents pointed out that they attended Janata Darbar of former CM Devendra Fadnavis , former guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule, former mayor Nanda Jichkar during her ‘Mayor at your doorstep’ campaign and sitting mayor Joshi’s ‘Walk and talk with mayor’ and Janta Darbar. “But the result of these meetings was zero,” said Chandan Nimje, a resident of Priyadarshini Nagar in south-west assembly constituency.

“We are facing severe health hazard due to choked sewerage network. NMC sanitation department could not help us due to encroachment over sewerage network,” he said. Nimje, along with other residents, met Mundhe and demanded razing the encroachments on the conservancy lanes in their locality.

Like Nimje, most complainants who met the civic chief said they have confidence that Mundhe will resolve their grievances.

Sai Mandir Sansthan secretary Avinash Shegaonkar pointed out to Mundhe how Laxmi Nagar zone officials were ‘protecting illegal encroachments’ inside the temple premises off Wardha Road.

Shegaonkar said that in 2007 the district court had directed removal of encroachments by nine shop vendors from the temple. Since last 13 years, the Sansthan is running pillar to post. “Even on January 1, the Laxmi Nagar zone has issued a 24-hour notice to the encroachers to remove their encroachments on their own or they will take action. Even after 27 days, nothing has happened,” he said. Shegaonkar blamed this on political interference.

Pravin Chafle pointed out dual rules of water works department, and said water connection of Karmyog Apartment in Dhantoli had been snapped a year ago following some dispute over payment of dues. Chafle, a resident of the flats, met Mundhe and claimed many flat owners had managed to get individual connections but the department is denying the same. Mundhe issued directives to the water works department to look into the matter at the earliest.

The civic chief has said that applications or complaints forwarded by his office are to be complied with as per the remarks by the civic chief, within the stipulated time mentioned there. He also directed that report of compliances should be handed over personally to his office staff, and not be sent in dak (post) or through general administration department.

As mayor Joshi was out of town, his Janata Darbar was chaired by deputy mayor Manisha Kothe. She heard around 40 complaints on issues like encroachments, lack of cleanliness, fogging, choked sewerage network, illegal constructions etc.

Trichy: BJP national secretary H Raja has accused the police of undermining the murder of dalit BJP functionary F Vijaya Raghu at Varaganeri by “a Muslim history-sheeter”. He said here on Wednesday that Islamic terrorism had been unleashed across Tamil Nadu under the guise of protesting against the citizenship amendment Act (CAA). “Vijaya Raghu has been murdered as part of that. But efforts are being made to underplay it,” he alleged.

Raja met the family members of Vijaya Raghu in Trichy in the morning and lashed out at the police for not arresting the alleged killer Mittai Babu alias Mohammed Babu. “Four hours after the murder, the murderer went to court but the police failed to arrest him. Instead, the police was quick to term it a murder with personal motive,” said Raja while condemning the statement of IG A Amalraj ruling out a communal angle in the murder. “If a police officer rules out the communal angle in a pre-emptive press conference, it will be a hint to the investigation officer (IO) to take the investigation in that angle. In the past one month, it was the third such murder. Those protecting law and order are biased. Police prevented us from splashing posters on the death to express our grief. If a Muslim meets with such a fate, will you stop them from pasting posters?,” asked Raja. tnn

Vadodara: The man who duped a woman afflicted with paralysis promising to treat her was arrested by the Raopura police on Wednesday. Accused Hafiz Mohammed Sheikh was nabbed from Kota in Rajasthan on basis of information.

Another accused, identified as Raju, who had met Meeta Tailor and given her Sheikh’s contact number is yet to be nabbed.

According to the police, 39-year-old Sheikh is a resident of Surat and has duped many people by posing as a doctor without actually having no medical qualification. Cops got information of his whereabouts after they circulated Sheikh’s photo. “He has also duped a resident of Gotri, Vijay Purohit, of Rs 50,000, resident of Sama, Brij Mohan, of Rs 35,000 and also another from Warasia, Kanhaiya Lal,” the police said.

Investigators are now trying to ascertain if Sheikh has duped more people in other cities of Gujarat as well. The incidents came to light when Tailor’s brother, Prashant Tailor, approached Raopura police a few days ago and filed a complaint against Sheikh.

Tailor told the cops that Raju had approached his sister sometime in October last year telling her about a doctor he knew who could cure her paralysis. Raju claimed that he too had paralysis and Sheikh, who was posing as Dr Rehman Malik, had cured him.

Prashant later called Raju who made the same claims to him before giving him Sheikh aka Dr Malik’s mobile number. Prashant called up on the number and Sheikh said he will pay a visit to to see his sister. On October 28, 2019, Sheikh visited Meeta at her home and took some blood samples too.

The accused then claimed that he can cure her. Malik demanded Rs 2.37 lakh for the treatment but later settled for Rs 2 lakh. Prashant gave him Rs 37,000 in cash and a cheque of Rs 1.15 lakh. Malik told him that he will send a receipt and his visiting card later. However, Malik never turned up for treatment not did he call again. Tailor told cops that all his calls to Sheikh went unanswered and later when Sheikh blocked him, he approached Raopura police to file a complaint of cheating.

Madras high court

MADURAI: Observing that marriage may reform a person, the Madras high court on Wednesday granted bail to a petitioner arrested in connection with an offence under the Tamil Nadu Prohibition Act , after taking a humanitarian view that his marriage is scheduled on January 30. The court also directed the superintendent of Kumbakonam sub-jail, where the petitioner has been lodged since January 24, to release him upon production of the order copy, as this is a special case.

Justice G R Swaminathan passed the order while hearing the bail plea of K Venkatesh, a resident of Kumbakonam in Thanjavur district. The judge observed that the court had granted anticipatory bail to Venkatesh in a case, however, he was implicated in one or more cases. The judge said the petitioner’s counsel contended that successive cases were registered against Venkatesh only to frustrate the relief granted by the court in the first instance.

Though there is a considerable force in the objection raised by the government advocate, the court cannot lose sight of the fact that the petitioner is getting married on January 30. “I hope that marriage may reform the petitioner,” the judge observed. The judge also noted that the government advocate also contacted the bride and confirmed that marriage is to be held on the scheduled date.

“The petitioner is now confined in Kumbakonam sub-jail. Obviously, prison is not an appropriate place to celebrate marriage,” observed the judge. Hence, the judge granted bail to the petitioner by taking into consideration the humanitarian aspect. “I am conscious that undertrials are not released after 6pm. But this being a special case, the superintendent of Kumbakonam sub-jail is directed to release the petitioner on production of a certified copy of this order,” observed the judge.

The judge further observed that if the police try to frustrate the order of this court by implicating the petitioner in some other case, serious view will be taken.

The judge noted that since the petitioner may not have time to furnish sureties, he is permitted to execute the sureties on February 5. The petitioner shall execute a bond for a sum of Rs 10,000 with two sureties each to the satisfaction of the Kumbakonam judicial magistrate I court. The judge also directed the petitioner to appear before the Kumbakonam police as and when required for the interrogation.

TRICHY: National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) vice-chairman L Murugan on Wednesday instructed the Trichy district administration to provide compensation to the family of dalit BJP functionary F Vijaya Raghu, 38, of Trichy who was murdered a few days ago.

“As Raghu belonged to the scheduled caste community, the case has been registered under the relevant sections. The district administration has been advised on paying compensation to the family,” Murugan told reporters after meeting family members at Varaganeri and the spot where Raghu was murdered.

Raghu was murdered by a gang led by H Mittai Babu Alias Mohammed Babu, also from Varaganeri, on Monday. F Senthilkumar, brother of Raghu, accused Babu of killing his brother at the behest of Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) over his involvement in pro-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) demonstrations in Gandhi Market in December 2019. The Gandhi Market police registered a case based on the complaint.

After meeting the family, Murugan said the family had explained to him about the involvement of Raghu in dissuading the traders from protesting against the shutdown protests called by anti-CAA protesters.

Murugan, quoting the family, said Babu had indulged in love jihadi targeting Raghu’s 17-year-old daughter for the past two years. “It is another serious issue that they (accused) have been disturbing the family in the name of love jihad. The family mentioned the dispute between them over the issue,” he said. Trichy collector S Sivarasu, city commissioner of police V Varadharaju and other officials accompanied Murugan during his visit.

It may be recalled that the SDPI had already condemned the BJP for tarnishing its image by linking its name in the case.

Former Madurai west chairman R M P Chinnan said that birthdays are formalities for many, but for people like him, it is an occasion to celebrate their great leader, and listed out various things that Alagiri has done for the benefit of the public. “It is better to live and die under the shadow of such a great person, who has done many things for the underprivileged people silently,” he said.

Most posters send out a message that Alagiri was not a person with a thirst for power. “The most dangerous is the desire for power and even more dangerous is the desire of power through treachery,” reads one poster, taking a dig at some of his supporters who switched loyalties. Another poster reads, “You are a person of luck, and things will take a turn in 2020.”

Meanwhile, the supporters of Alagiri have organised many events to mark his birthday. Last year was a low-key affair as Alagiri himself had gone out of town. This year, however, he is participating in the marriage function of the family of Madurai lawyers association secretary.

Welfare measures are also planned to be distributed in many Madurai Corporation wards, where the urban local body elections are expected to be held later this year. Many of his supporters are planning to contest these polls as independent candidates.

Nagpur: Citizens may soon have a new app to register their civic complaints. New municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe , who had introduced similar apps during his earlier postings at Nashik and Navi Mumbai, is planning to launch one.

Earlier experiments with mobile apps have not been very successful in city owing to absence of follow up action on complaints. In an informal chat with mediapersons, Mundhe the the app will help Nagpurians register their complaints, get necessary information about civic departments, and raise queries.

Currently, there are no portals or apps for citizens to lodge complaints through online system. As a result, a large number of people come to the respective NMC offices and then run from pillar to post. If the app is launched, they won’t need to come. They can simply upload their queries and the office will take care of the rest, he said.

“If the system is online, it will not only save citizens effort but also help the civic body redress their grievances,” he said. Mundhe said his priority would be to make Nagpur city more livable and economically vibrant by improving facilities for all sections.

He also signalled his intention to speed up projects in Nagpur and stressed on the need to improve NMC’s financial condition. With limited resources, the civic body should focus on income along with planning expenditure on various projects. Mundhe said his focus will be on improving public transport system and healthcare.

Vijayawada: Tension prevailed at a private hospital in Tadigadappa village near the city on Wednesday after the family members of a deceased patient alleged medical negligence on the part of his doctors. The deceased, Madagani Ramesh (47), belonged to Tarigoppula of Ungutur mandal in Krishna district.

According Penamaluru circle inspector M Satyanarayana, the incident happened around 4 pm when doctors declared Ramesh dead.

He had gone to the hospital for a medical check up. Sources said doctors informed Ramesh’s family that he had suffered cardiac arrest after they conducted the tests.

They then rushed him to intensive care unit and conducted an angiogram test. He was kept under observation for almost three hours. Later, doctors asked his friend Syam Babu who accompanied him to sign a disclaimer form, which he refused as doctors failed to explain Ramesh’s medical condition. Moments later, doctors informed Ramesh’s death due to cardiac arrest. Police said they recorded the statements of the aggrieved family and launched an investigation into the matter.

The circle inspector added that the doctors’ statements too were recorded. Police are waiting for the family to lodge a complaint.

125,['30/01/2020'],"MP: Kamal Nath government to roll out 365-day work scheme, Rs 5,000 stipend for jobless","This story is from January 30, 2020

MP CM Kamal Nath

BHOPAL: The Kamal Nath government is coming up with a ramped up version of Yuva Swabhiman Yojana, a scheme for the unemployed — hiking monthly stipend to Rs 5,000 and increasing the number of working (hence payable) days to 365.

The decision comes just about a week after Nath’s return from the WEF meet at Davos, where he showcased MP’s potential before investors and emphasized the need to mobilize economy and generate more jobs.

Yuva Swabhiman Yojana — a Congress manifesto promise and a flagship programme of the Nath government — was launched on January 31, 2019, guaranteeing 100 days of work and pay to unemployed youth who have registered themselves with the Madhya Pradesh government. CM Nath is going to launch its 2.0 version on February 1, public relations minister P C Sharma said.

“We have decided to relaunch the scheme for unemployed youths after a year. The stipend has been hiked by Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000 per month. On the lines of MNREGS, the government is ready to extend the guarantee of 100 workdays to 365 days of temporary employment a year,” Sharma told TOI on Wednesday.

The government’s decision came after review of a year of the scheme, where youths asked for better stipend and more workdays. The feedback was accepted and the government decided to relaunch it in a new avatar. The government will make a special allocation for it in the state budget to make it more effective and practical, Sharma said.

“The relaunch aims to generate 25,000 new jobs at an expense of Rs 200 crore. The urban development department has prepared a plan to select registered unemployed youths for temporary jobs as per their qualification and provide them with 10 days of training,” said the minister.

The scheme is part of Nath’s attempt to generate employment and boost economy. Before the launch of the job scheme in 2019, the CM had envisaged a new law to reserve 70% jobs in private sector for MP domiciles. He said the unemployment allowance will help MP’s jobless youngsters fight adversities.

“The number of registered educated unemployed in MP in October 2018 was 20.77 lakh and in October 2019, it is 27.79 lakh,” the CM had said, adding, “Of these, 17,506 youth were picked for jobs in job fairs organized during the last year, while 2,520 were picked for jobs during placement drives. Also, 13,740 jobs were created with the setting up of 25 new industries in MP, which topped the list in unemployment for 15 years before our government came.”

Only a day ago, Congress youth wing leader and MLA Kunal Chaudhary had called for the creation of a ‘National Register for Unemployment’ (NRU), rather than NRC, and demanded that the Centre disclose data on jobs created in the last six months.

The BJP dubbed the 365-day work scheme “futile”. “The relaunch itself exposes the Congress government’s failure in fulfilling its promises. Not a single jobless youth was given stipend or a new job. This is mere face-saving. Congress should come clear with previous records of generating employment,” said BJP MLA Vishwas Sarang.

Amaravati: The fate of new government medical colleges is hanging in the balance as the Centre has returned the state government’s proposals seeking more information. The Centre recently cleared 26 colleges in different states under centrally sponsored scheme (CSC). Although the state government has sought the Centre’s assistance under CSS for setting up at least three colleges, the Centre turned down the request.

The Centre has decided to build at least 75 new medical colleges across the country by 2022-23. The decision was taken to make quality health services more accessible to the people. However, priority would be given to districts in which no government medical college exists. Interestingly, Tamil Nadu has bagged six medical colleges in one go, while no proposal from AP could pass muster. In fact, the YS Jaganmohan Reddy government has decided to set up at least seven medical colleges one each in Paderu, Vizianagaram, Eluru, Machilipatnam, Gurazala, Markapuram and Pulivendula. In the first phase, the state government requested the Centre to include three projects — Araku, Machilipatnam and Gurazala under CSC. Since the Centre would extend 60 per cent financial support under CSC, the state government wanted to take up three colleges in the first phase and four in the second phase. The state cabinet recently discussed the issue of getting financial support for the medical colleges. Sources said the Centre turned down the proposals on the grounds that the three districts already have government medical colleges.

Sources said Jagan directed officials to send the proposals once again. Since the state government is actively considering forming another 12 districts, the chief minister is believed to have asked officials to pitch their arguments such that it is clear the new colleges would come up in the districts that do not have government medical colleges.

Representative image

MADURAI: Madras high court has directed the state government to file a counter on a plea which sought to appoint a chairperson for the state human rights commission (SHRC) which is lying vacant since November 2019.

In his petition, Thirumurugan, a resident of Ramanathapuram district , stated that the post of the SHRC chairperson was vacant after the completion of the tenure of retired high court justice T Meenakumari in November. Due to this, the functioning of SHRC is affected and there is a delay in hearing the cases and rendering justice to the victims of human rights violations.

Without a chairperson only one-third of the cases are being heard when compared to that of the numbers of cases which were heard in the presence of the chairperson. He stated that no steps were taken to even appoint an acting chairperson so far.

Though he had submitted a representation to the state government seeking to appoint a chairperson, no steps were taken so far. Hence, he moved the high court Madurai bench.

When the petition was heard on Wednesday, a division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran gave the direction to the state government and adjourned the case to a further date for hearing.

Some roads in Dehradun wore a deserted look on Wednesday.

MEERUT: The call for countrywide strike -- Bharat Bandh-- given by a few outfits met with mixed response in western Uttar Pradesh and in neighbouring Uttarakhand as shops and other establishments in minority-dominated parts of some cities were shut, leaving the normal life unaffected on Wednesday. The Bandh call was given against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizenship (NRC).

In western UP ’s Meerut, the Bandh call evoked a similar response. Only some parts of the city were affected. The district had witnessed widespread violence during the anti-CAA protests on December 20, leaving five dead and scores of others injured.

Security personnel were on their toes during the entire day, making sure that the Bandh passes of peacefully.

Two FIRs were registered, and nine persons were arrested from Meerut alone. Three youths were arrested in Baghpat district for putting up posters and forcibly closing shops leading to clash with police. Shamli and Bijnor also witnessed partial shutdown. Police conducted flag march in Bijnor.

While in Saharanpur, police is in the process of identifying “a few individuals who tried to incite locals in Khatta Kheri area of the district.” Agra and Bareilly districts also remained unaffected.

ADG of Meerut zone, comprising nine districts of West UP, Prashant Kumar told TOI, “Bharat Bandh passed of peacefully with sporadic incidents where strong action was taken. Only Meerut and Baghpat were two districts where arrests were made and FIRs filed when a few anti-social elements tried to disrupt peace. Otherwise, the zone remained peaceful. In fact, Ganga Yatra also entered Bareilly zone on Wednesday with no untoward incident reported anywhere.”

In Uttarakhand’s capital city Dehradun, hundreds of Muslim men, women and children participated in a day-long protest organised at Dharna Sthal near Parade Ground. Traders and shopkeepers from the community kept their shops closed on a call given by the ‘Shaher Qazi’. The protests were peaceful amid heavy police presence.

Minority-dominated areas like Inamullah, Muslim Basti and Azad Colony witnessed shutdown.

Danish Qureshi, founder of Muslim Seva Sangathan, said, “If you see the trend in entire country, Muslims are protesting very peacefully and in unique ways. Be it in Shaheen Bagh or in Dehradun. We simply want the government to understand that we are not happy with this step and our sentiments should be respected.”

Apart from police, a company of PAC was also deployed in the city. “The city was divided into five zones and 11 sectors where cops remained alert entire day. Nothing untoward had happened in the course of protest,” said SP City Shweta Chaubey.

Reacting to the protest, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said, “Only people from a particular community are protesting on this issue, which is suspicious. What problem people have if the government has come up with a law to give citizenship to minorities in other countries where they were suppressed.”

Sarsai Nawar wetland in Etawah

KANPUR: Environmentalists hailed the Union government’s decision of adding Sarsai Nawar wetland in Etawah and Saman wetland in Mainpuri to the list of wetland sites protected under the Ramsar Convention. The demand of including Sarsai Nawar and Saman wetland in Ramsar Sites was pending since long.

Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar recently announced that 10 more wetlands, including Sarsai Nawar and Saman, are being added in sites protected by the Ramsar Convention. Society for Conservation of Nature (SCON) chief Dr Rajiv Chauhan, said, “We have been working extensively to conserve wetlands and had approached authorities several times for this. The decision will facilitate breeding of state bird Sarus (Grus-antigone).”

“This is best timing as huge number of migratory birds from across the world flock to both wetlands at this time of the year. Also, World Wetland Day, which marks the date of signing of convention on wetlands in 1971 in the Iranian city of Ramsar, is approaching on February 2,” said Sanjiv Chauhan, a senior memeber of SCON.

The Ramsar Site list aims to develop and maintain an international network of wetlands for conservation of global biological diversity and sustaining human life through maintenance of their ecosystem components, processes and benefits. Wetlands declared as Ramsar Sites are protected under strict guidelines.

With these inclusions, a total of 37 sites in the country have been recognised under the international treaty, one of the oldest inter-governmental accords for preserving the ecological character of wetlands.

In past six months, ministry of environment, forest & climate change prepared a four-pronged strategy for restoration of wetlands which includes preparing a baseline data, wetland health cards, enlisting wetland mitras and preparing targeted Integrated Management Plans. Conservation of wetlands would also go a long way in conservation of water and achieving PM Modi’s ambitious scheme of ‘Nal se Jal.’ The ministry would be working closely with the State Wetland Authorities to ensure wise use of these sites.

Thiruvananthapuram: The Kattakkada police, who are probing the murder of Sangeeth Balan (37) of Ambalathinkala, have recorded the arrest of one more person in connection with the case. The police identified the accused as Sujith alias Manikkuttan (34) of Kottampalli.

Sujith, a tipper truck driver, is the ninth person to be arrested in connection with the alleged murder. The other arrested persons are Vijin, Linu, Mithun, Stalin John alias Saju, Uthaman alias Manikantan, Lal Kumar alias Unni, Vineesh alias Thenga Aneesh and Baiju.

Kattakkada station house officer inspector D Bijukumar said that Sujith was an employee of Uthaman. He had allegedly helped two main accused in the case, Saju and Uthaman, to flee from the crime scene after committing the crime. He took the other two accused on a motorcycle and dropped them off at their respective houses before the police personnel arrived on the scene. Sujith was taken into custody from his residence at Kottampalli, the inspector said.

The inspector added that while Sujith would be produced before the court on Thursday, the police would be seeking custody of the other eight accused, who are currently in judicial custody, for further investigation. The police would be filing an application in this regard before the court on Thursday.

The murder took place on a property owned by Sangeeth during the early hours of Friday. The gang, which turned up with an earthmover and tipper truck, started digging up soil from his property. When he objected, the gang viciously attacked him by hitting him using the earthmover, inflicting serious injuries that eventually caused his death.

Though almost all the persons who were present on the crime scene have been nabbed, the police are still continuing probe into the suspected involvement of more people such as those who helped the accused hide from the police to evade arrest.

Vijayawada: Civil liberties and Dalits groups on Wednesday urged the state government to constitute a human rights commission without further delay.

They alleged that the state was witnessing a spurt in violation of human rights and accused the government of adopting coercive measures to silence people instead of getting to the root cause of the problem.

Speaking to media persons, Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties Association general secretary P Suresh Kumar and Kula Vivaksha Vyatireka Porata Samithi (committee against caste discrimination) general secretary Andra Malyadri said successive governments have ignored pleas for appointment of chairperson and members of the commission.

They pointed out that the high court had directed the state government on October 30, 2019, to constitute a human rights commission. The government too had vowed before the court to fulfil the obligation. However, till now, the government has not appointed either a chairperson or a member.

They further said the government had not opened the office for the state human rights commission after the bifurcation. Although all government offices, including legal and judicial offices, were shifted from Hyderabad, the human rights commission was not shifted. They asked the state government to shift the office immediately.

135,['30/01/2020'],"Hospital comes up next to SWM unit in Talakadu, locals worried","This story is from January 30, 2020

tt

Mysuru: Putting a waste management project next to a hospital might come across as a no-brainer but that is the curious situation in Talakadu, where a solid waste management (SWM) unit has been built at Rs 25 lakh and the Mother and Child Hospital, at an estimated Rs 8 crore, is being built barely 20 feet away.

Residents have now raised concerns as the hospital is set to be completed in six months. Authorities say they will wait for the hospital to open and if safety concerns persist, the SWM will be shifted despite the cost involved. Others say the hospital complex will be elevated to ensure there is no risk.

“The construction of the hospital will be completed in six months. We expect that the government will take another six months to appoint doctors and staff. Once the doctors come to the hospital, we will take their opinion and if they feel the SWM Unit may pose a problem, we will shift it,” Talakadu zilla panchayat member Manjunathan told TOI. “We have enough land to construct another SWM Unit, but we are waiting for the medical professionals’ opinion as we do not want to waste the public money which has already been invested for the construction of the SWM unit.”

Several development projects, including the SWM unit and the hospital, were launched in T Narasipura taluk by former PWD minister HC Mahadevappa. Both the projects got approval in the assembly and the funds were sanctioned immediately.

The two structures were planned next to each other at Arundhati Nagar. The SWM unit is also close to BCM, SC and ST Hostels and the Dandinamaramma temple.

Currently, segregated waste from households and commercial establishments is processed at the SWM unit. While the wet waste is converted to compost at the unit, plastic waste is given to nearby factories. As a pilot project, plastic from only one locality is making its way to the unit; pourakarmikas collect nearly a ton of the waste per week.

Even as the SWM is yet to go fully operational, the hospital already has a first floor and another is being added. Locals say the waste from the unit is a contamination risk and potential infection cannot be ruled out once the hospital is opened.

Zilla panchayat deputy secretary (development) M Krishnaraju, however, sought to downplay the concerns. “Only dry waste is being collected at the SWM unit. There is no problem for the hospital. The health department has also assured it will increase the height of the hospital compound to prevent any disturbance from the SWM unit,” he said.

Youth pass Jama Masjid in Mominpura on their way to Samvidhan Sq

Nagpur: Samvidhan Chowk turned into a Shaheenbagh for over a couple of hours on Wednesday afternoon.

Over 30,000, of which nearly a quarter were burka clad women, jammed the busy road till 5 in the evening. After a series of protests throughout the month, the intensity of Shaheenbagh could finally be achieved on Wednesday when the Bharat bandh call was given against NRC-CAA.

Men supported the women by forming a human chain around them to prevent any disturbance from those walking past the group. Even as sloganeering continued from the stage, the women behind it sang patriotic songs, waving the tricolour and calling for ‘Humko Chahiye Azaadi’.

The turnout of over 30,000 in the dharna organized by Jamiat-e-Ulema-e-Hind at this venue was unprecedented, said sources.

The turnout of over 30,000 protesters is said to be more than even that seen during the Triple Talaq agitation held in the city.

A large number of women were accommodated on the space along the Vidhan Bhavan compounded while an equal number of protesters spilled on to the road.

Traffic around Samvidhan Square was diverted as the stretch from Shree Mohini Complex to Zero Mile was filled with protesters who continued to throng the venue beyond 5pm.

Cops said permission was granted for the Jamiat dharna with an expected crowd of 10,000 but people from different parts of the city poured in assuming it as Bahujan Kranti Morcha’s Bharat Bandh.

Professionals, including doctors and lawyers too came out in support during the dharna.

All Muslims doctors kept their OPDs shut for the day.

Deafening cheers on ‘Humko Chahiye Azaadi’ slogans were heard.

Well-known cardiologist Aziz Khan said he had come assuming it as national duty. “I can afford to skip a patient as it is more important to save India and our constitution than an individual’s life,” he said.

Some more doctors, in their speeches, said they or their patients never asked each other’s religion before coming for treatment.

The peaceful protest ended with mass prayers and recital of the National Anthem as huge tricolours dotted the venue.

Madurai: More than 13 years after a case was registered against a village administrative officer (VAO) for receiving a bribe, a Kanyakumari court has convicted him to four years rigorous imprisonment (RI) and slapped a fine of Rs 20,000 on Tuesday. Chief judicial magistrate (CJM)-cum-special judge K Arunachalam convicted VAO D Chandra after finding him guilty of receiving Rs 2,000 bribe from the complainant T Callins.

Callins had approached Chandra who was the VAO of Painkulam village in Kanyakumari district for sending a recommendation report for quarrying rock in Painkulam. On November 6, 2006, Chandra demanded Rs 20,000 for the same and sought Rs 2,000 as first instalment. The remaining Rs 18,000 was to be given to him after the report was forwarded by the VAO.

A trap was set by sleuths from the directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption (DVAC) and Chandra was caught red-handed while receiving Rs 2,000 from Callins on November 8, 2006. Chandra was arrested and remanded in judicial custody. After investigations the chargesheet was filed before the CJM in April 2008 for offences punishable under Sections 7 and 13(2) read with 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.

Representative image

MADURAI: A five-member gang barged into a grocery store at Chinna Kanmoi locality in Mela Anupanadi and attacked the shop owner using machetes. They also hurled a couple of petrol bombs in an attempt to burn the shop.

K V Ganesan, 42, the shop owner suffered cut injuries on his left hand and right leg and lost a few fingers on his hand and leg in the attack . While the gang left the place presuming that he was dead, his relatives shifted him to a hospital, where he is undergoing treatment. He is responding well to treatment, relatives said.

The incident took place around 10.45pm on Wednesday, while Ganesan was about to close the shop.

A police officer said the accused have been identified using the CCTV footage from a nearby place. They are seen entering the shop and attacking the owner and hurling petrol bombs. A few of the perpetrators were previously arrested for their involvement in other cases, he said.

“Only one of the two bombs went off resulting in a minor fire. It was put off by the public,” he added.

Ganesan’s elder brother K V Chandrasekar along with a few relatives petitioned the deputy commissioner of police (law and order), Madurai city, E Karthick. Chandrasekar said the deputy commissioner had assured to take stringent action and arrest the accused at the earliest.

He said that Ganesan had questioned a few youths, who were involved in a ruckus during Pongal celebrations recently. They were dancing under the influence of alcohol and creating disturbance to the public. This resulted in a verbal altercation. Soon, they started beating up Ganesan.

“We had lodged a complaint with the Teppakulam police station against the youths, but we did not pursue further after some prominent people from our area spoke to us. They assured us that the youths will not create any further problem. We did not expect such an attack,” Chandrasekar said.

A team from the Teppakulam police station conducted an inquiry.

141,['30/01/2020'],Wadhawan diverted Rs 13k cr DHFL money to 1 lakh fake a/cs: ED,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Mumbai: Former CMD of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd ( DHFL ) Kapil Wadhawan had allegedly siphoned off Rs 12,773 crore with the help of 79 shadow entities and one lakh fictitious customers, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) alleged on Wednesday.

A few Mumbai -based builders are under the ED scanner in the case as part of the money was allegedly diverted to them through fictitious transactions.

“The malaise is running deep and rough estimate gives (sic) such illegal diversions of funds to 79 such shadowy entities without any sanction or paperwork in garb of retail loans to approximately one lakh fictitious individual customers to be in access of Rs 12,773 crore in 2015,” ED alleged in its plea before the special court, seeking seven-day extension of Wadhawan’s custody.

ED officials are trying to trace the money trail by investigating details of the shadow entities. The entities existed only on paper and were allegedly linked to the promoters, the agency said.

The ED produced Wadhawan before the special court, and his custody was extended till Friday. The defence told the court that Wadhawan was suspected to be suffering from swine flu.

The ED had arrested Wadhawan on Monday in the money laundering case it is investigating against late underworld gangster Iqbal Memon alias Mirchi and for siphoning of funds. During the remand hearing on Wednesday, Wadhawan’s advocate Amit Desai told the court that the ED was investigating him for siphoning off DHFL funds, and this was not connected with the money laundering case involving Mirchi.

The ED alleged part of the siphoned-off money was also used to pay Mirchi for purchasing his three buildings at Worli.

However, Desai said the funds which ED claimed had left DHFL did not go into any Mirchi matter. “It has nothing to do with Iqbal Mirchi,” Desai said. Desai also submitted the money was invested in various assets which have now become security. “Over the last one and a half years, Wadhawan has made sure all those assets where the funds were being utilised are all the security of DHFL under the supervision of banks who were participating in the activities of discharging the liability. These assets are now available for the benefit of creditors of DHFL,” he said.

Desai said that among the assets are also large lands outside the city under development, and their term sheets show that if fully developed, their value would be in the excess of Rs 30,000 crore. “This is far more than the claims that are outstanding today,” Desai said.

DHFL owes Rs 83,873 crore to banks, mutual funds and investors and is the first non-banking finance company (NBFC) to be referred to the bankruptcy court by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) last November.

But the ED insisted that siphoning of funds was connected with the money laundering case. They alleged part of the siphoned-off fund was used to pay Mirchi and the rest was laundered.

The remand plea submitted and argued by ED special counsels Hiten Venegaonkar and Sunil Gonsalves said the investigating agency had recorded statements of several present and former senior officials of DHFL. The statements of persons disclosed a startling fact about the state of affairs and gory saga of siphoning, money laundering and other serious offences, ED said.

The ED told the court Wadhawan was instrumental in working of DHFL group decisions to grant loans to these companies and he was not revealing anything during interrogation. The ED also informed the court they were searching some premises from Wednesday noon and had collected digital evidences which they needed to confront Wadhawan with.

ED said, “It appears to be a scam of wider ramifications wherein more than Rs 12,700 crore has been diverted illegally and Wadhawan is a prime conspirator.”

It stated that DHFL had given Rs 50 crore loan to Sunblink to purchase Mirchi’s property though there was no property in the name of the company. Apart from that, it said DHFL diverted a loan amounting to Rs 1,500 crore (with interest it’s Rs 2,186 crore) to five shell companies in 2011-12 “without any legal authority and under the garb of housing loan etc to individual customers”. While clearing loans to the five entities, procedure was not followed as security for the loan was not created and the issue was not cleared by the board’s finance committee but signed only by the promoters, Dheeraj and Kapil Wadhawan.

Later, the five shell companies were merged with Sunblink to cover alleged diversions of loans acquired from DHFL. The ED said later Sunblink created a new mortgage on the Worli buildings showing its worth as Rs 2,186 crore, though Sunblink had purchased the property for Rs 111 crore. The ED claimed Wadhawan’s brother Dheeraj aka Baba Dewan paid Rs154 crore directly to Mirchi abroad through one of his companies in Dubai. The ED suspects Wadhawan paid more money to Mirchi for redeveloping the Worli buildings. The ED said Sunblink is a front company of Wadhawan, where his relative Sunny Bhatija is a director.

The ED has filed a criminal case against Mirchi, his family members and others to probe money laundering charges for alleged illegal dealings in purchase and sale of costly real estate assets in Mumbai. Mirchi, who died in 2013 in London, was said to be the right-hand man of global terrorist Dawood Ibrahim.

using force: Police laticharge the crowd in Yavatmal

Yavatmal/Akola/Chandrapur/Washim: Sporadic incidents of violence were reported from a few districts of Vidarbha during the daylong bandh called to protest against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC), on Wednesday. A trader couple in Yavatmal opposed the bandh, and threw chilli powder at the youths who tried to force them to shut shop.

Thousands of protesters marched on the streets in different cities to oppose the CAA. Incidents of stone-pelting were reported from a few places in Akola, Washim and Yavatmal districts. Police had to resort to lathicharge to bring situation under control.

In Yavatmal, Pro-bandh activists were seen moving in the city forcing traders to close their shops. Most of the traders succumbed to the pressure and pulled down their shutters. When a trader Kishor Poddar and his wife refused to shut their shop saying they support the CAA, a group of protesters barged into their shop and tried to ransack it. The shopkeeper couple used chilli powder to thwart the bid to down the shutters.

Later, police had to use mild force at two places to disperse protesters who were raising anti-CAA/NRC slogans. Some minor altercation took place when a group opposing the bandh objected to the protesters ‘forcing’ traders to shut their establishments. Police had detained 40 women and over 20 others.

Police also reported to cane charge at Marwadi Chowk and Nehru Chowk in the city to disperse unruly protesters.

In Akola district, protesters indulged in stone-pelting at Patur and Balapur. A few buses were damaged at Balapur. Hundreds of protesters, carrying anti-CAA/NRC placards had gathered in front of Patur police station and raised slogans. After some anti-socials indulged in stone-pelting, the police used force to bring the situation under control.

In Chandrapur, the bandh evoked mixed response. Traders’ union here had opposed the bandh and approached district collector and superintendent of police seeking protection. No untoward incident took place during the day and bandh remained peaceful.

Protesters went around in groups during the morning hours and closed down shops that had opened. Shops and other establishments, however, opened again later in the day. Many traders refused to close down their shops and stuck stickers claiming that they stand in support of the government decision on CAA.

A delegation of Chandrapur Vyapari Mandal members met collector and SP to apprise them of the difficulties faced by the people and traders due to frequent bandh calls. They told the officials that traders in the city had to close down their shops nearly 20 times in 2019 following such bandh calls, affecting their businesses.

A large number of protesters, gathered at Jatpura Gate and Ambedkar Chowk, raised slogans against the central government and the “black law”.

Vijayawada: Despite the government’s new sand policies and the door-to-door delivery scheme, illegal sand transportation continues unabated. Krishna district police admitted to TOI that illegal transportation takes place along the AP-Telangana border.

Smugglers have been trying to move sand from Krishna district to Hyderabad and other parts of Telangana to take advantage of soaring prices. With increasing construction activity, the price of sand currently stands at Rs 1,500 per load in Hyderabad, according to Telangana State Mineral Development Corporation (TSMDC) officials.

Prices have, however, dipped from Rs 2,500 per load in November 2019 — a decrease of 66 per cent. Interestingly, Krishna district police have flagged a drastic rise in interstate sand smuggling in the past few months as the new sand policy is effective only within Andhra Pradesh. Mafias mine sand from the banks of the Krishna and sell it in Telangana.

On Wednesday, cops seized two trucks and a tipper lorry illegally carrying sand from Kanchikacherla towards Tiruvuru. On receiving a tip off, task force police stopped heavy vehicles near the inter-state border at Lakshmipuram area and seized the produce.

Over 250 cases have been booked by the vigilance and enforcement directorate in Krishna district in 2019. From January 2, when the door-delivery of sand was launched first in the district, there has been a decline in sand smuggling within the district but the overall business continues to boom through their interstate operations.

Vijayawada: The state government’s sand door-delivery scheme is receiving a huge response from builders and consumers across Krishna district. AP Mineral Development Corporation (APMDC) started the pilot project to supply sand directly to consumers in the district on January 2 in a bid to control illegal sand mining and transportation.

The government, which initially faced criticism for insufficient supply, has now dumped huge quantities of sand at stock points.

The APMDC decided to deliver sand directly to buyers and builders upon receiving a barrage of complaints on sand smuggling. Consumers can directly book sand trucks by making an online payment on APMDC’s sand sales portal. Upon confirmation, the ordered sand will be directly delivered at the doorstep of the construction site or individual concerned.

Krishna district collector A Md Imtiaz said the pilot project was a huge success in the district and they have successfully delivered around 6,030 orders. “Door delivery of sand will help consumers get quality sand at an affordable price fixed by the government. We accept only online orders and the consumer’s details, including a copy of their ID card, will be collected while placing the order. GPS-enabled trucks will deliver the stock at the address of the buyer, thus controling illegal stockyards,” Imtiaz said.

Chief Minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy expressed satisfaction over the door-to-door sand supply and authorities of APMDC are gearing up to implement the scheme across the state soon.

Authorities of APMDC explained that truck owners delivering sand were also happy with the scheme as they were receiving transport charges within 48 hours of delivering sand. Officials said they were working on depositing the money within 24 hours of delivering the order in the coming days.

145,['30/01/2020'],Mysuru: Special drive to curb smoking in public places soon,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Representative image

MYSURU: The district health authorities are on a mission to curb smoking in public places. A special drive has been planned as most of the shopkeepers are not following directives as per the provisions of Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA), 2003.

Sellers of cigarette and tobacco products have to compulsorily display the caution board on prominent locations at their places and ensure that buyers don’t smoke on their premises. But it is not followed strictly, said health authorities.

District health officer R Venkatesh told TOI that they had imposed a fine of Rs 200 on some shopkeepers for not adhering to rules and had been frequently checking it. However, some of them were still not following it. A special drive would be carried out to check whether vendors have put up boards and smoking in public places, he said.

As per Section (4) of COTPA, smoking in public places is banned.

Public place is defined as any place to which the public has access to including auditorium, hospital building, railway waiting room, amusement centre, public offices, court building, libraries, coffee houses, canteens, banks, clubs and also open spaces surrounding hotels and restaurants.

Hotels having a minimum of 30 rooms can have a separate ‘smoking area’ with proper air flow system but public places can’t have smoking areas. The board should of a prescribed size, with a message–NO SMOKING AREA, SMOKING HERE IS AN OFFENCE—in bold letters. This must be displayed by all shops selling cigarettes and tobacco products, failing which a fine will be levied.

Smoking in almost all the tea shops are allowed in Mysuru and not many have put up the ‘No Smoking Area’ board. On the contrary, a health department staffer claimed that smoking in public places have come down. “We have sought police help to carry out a drive to curb smoking in public places,” he said.

Not just sellers, even the smokers have been penalized by the health department. An official claimed that authorities attached to all 26 government agencies can check smoking in public place and penalize the wrongdoers but due to lack of protection, many desist from implementing it.

From April 2019 till date, 1,232 cases have been registered for smoking in public places and a fine of Rs 2,19,700 has been collected.

Amaravati: Minister for municipal administration Botcha Satyanarayana on Wednesday said the government was in no hurry to issue an ordinance regarding the setting up of three capital cities.

He, however, said that the government was committed to make Visakhapatnam, the executive capital city.

The minister said the government would wait for the completion of the legislative process to take the final call. Botcha criticized TDP for backing the GN Rao committee report after burning it in the bonfire only a few days ago. Admitting that GN Rao committee had said Visakhapatnam has threat from cyclones, Botcha said the city would not get washed away in cyclones.

The minister said all the coastal districts, including Vizag are prone to be hit by cyclones and it was not a new finding. “We have not said that we are going to prevent cyclones and natural calamities. The high-level committee studied the reports of the experts’ committees and put its recommendations before the government. This government is committed to take measures keeping all the suggestions of the committees in mind,” said Botcha.

He lashed out at TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu for changing his stance according to his convenience. He said Naidu had burnt the reports of the GN Rao committee and BCG on Bhogi Day and appealed to his party cadres to do so. Naidu took a U-turn to defend the GN Rao committee report for his convenience, said Botcha. “How could Naidu defend the report now,” asked Botcha.

Madurai: There are no safety issues concerning the Mullaperiyar dam, and the water level can be increased to 152ft after strengthening the baby dam, the high-level committee appointed by the Supreme Court has said.

The committee, led by its chairman and chief engineer of dam safety, Central Water Commission, Gulshan Raj inspected the baby dam, gallery, and the functioning of the shutters on Tuesday.

Later, speaking to reporters, Raj said they did not notice any safety concern in the dam during the inspection. The shutters were operated and found to be functioning well. He said the dam’s water level could be increased to its original maximum level of 152ft, after strengthening the baby dam. This should be done in co-operation with the two state governments concerned.

The committee was accompanied by officials from Tamil Nadu and Kerala, including principal secretary of public works department (PWD), K Manivasan and secretary of water resources of Kerala, B Ashok.

The committee also held discussions with members of the sub-committee from both states. Executive engineer of Periyar-Vaigai basin, T Subramanian said they had asked for the road work to the dam, for which the Tamil Nadu government had already allocated Rs 1.5 crore, be started at the earliest. This road is not motorable, as it was not maintained for a decade. They also discussed the strengthening of the baby dam, and providing electricity to the dam.

Work would also begin on installing a CCTV camera network at the dam site as part of the measure to increase security, he said.

148,['30/01/2020'],Shifting Aarey car shed will see massive cost escalation: Panel,"The proposed Metro III car shed site

'Any alternative to Aarey will delay the Metro'

MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government-appointed committee to study alternatives to the Metro’s Aarey car shed submitted a draft report to chief secretary Ajoy Mehta on Tuesday. A senior bureaucrat told TOI that the report was “inconclusive”, though it mentioned a “massive cost escalation” as a consequence of shifting the depot.“The government is likely to grant a two-week extension to the panel [headed by additional chief secretary (finance) Manoj Saunik] for submitting the final report. After that, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will take a call on the Metro 3 depot’s location,” the bureaucrat said.State environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray said the panel’s recommendations “are not binding”. “A final decision will be taken only after studying the report, which has not yet been fully submitted,” Aaditya said.Besides examining Aarey, the panel studied two more locations, said the bureaucrat TOI spoke to.“It felt that if the Metro depot is shifted from its present location, Aarey, it will result in a massive cost escalation, not to mention a time overrun,” he said, clarifying that “the committee has not expressed its opinion on whether the present location of the car shed should be shifted, but has merely expressed its views on different options”.A senior cabinet member said that in the event the panel recommends that it won’t be advisable to shift the depot from Aarey, it will be interpreted as a huge defeat for Aaditya, who supported the agitation against the cutting of trees at Aarey for the depot, saying it was a forest and that a rampant cutting of trees violated the Forest (Conservation) Act.The state government appears to have bought time by giving the committee studying the Aarey depot issue a fortnight to finalise its report. The vexing decision hinges on a cost-benefit analysis of infrastructural and environmental issues.Sources close to the panel said alternatives to the Aarey depot were studied but the view is they are not feasible due to technical and financial reasons. A proposed site at Kanjurmarg was found to be marshy and marred by litigation; it is also at least 7km from the last Metro 3 station, Seepz, which means trains would have to make dead trips to reach the depot, and more rolling stock would have to be requisitioned, making it financially unviable.The Colaba-Seepz line is 30km long, which makes a 7km extension equal to a quarter of the planned route. “The line has been planned for a service frequency of 2 minutes. If this is affected, crowds will gather at stations, defeating the very purpose of the Metro,” said a source. “Alternatively, if the depot is shifted, to follow the 2-minute frequency, 16 rakes would have to be stationed near the last stop during operation hours, which again would mean parking facilities at Aarey.”Another issue, he said, is that the trees cut at the site have rendered the situation as fait accompli, leaving little to be salvaged from the environmental standpoint. The best case scenario now would be to enforce mitigation measures around the car shed to protect the rest of the area.This would also be in line with court directions, which have not opposed development at the site.A source said the panel looked at Metro lines in Bangalore, Ahmedabad and Delhi, and concluded that a depot for Metro 3 would require 25 hectares, which is available only at Aarey. A second option, a plot near Royal Palms in Goregaon, was found to be technically unfeasible and inadequate.However, a state cabinet member said if the panel finally recommends against shifting the depot from Aarey, it will be seen as a setback for environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, who backed the stir against cutting of trees at Aarey.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73757760,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-436922,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/shifting-aarey-car-shed-will-see-massive-cost-escalation-panel/articleshow/73748115.cms

MADURAI: The consumer grievances redressal forum in Tirunelveli has directed a toll plaza situated on the Tirunelveli to Tuticorin national highway to pay Rs 20,005 for deficiency in service and charging Rs 5 more than the fare prescribed for a consumer’s vehicle. The order was based on a complaint filed by K Prabakaran, 42, an advocate of Veeravanallur in Tirunelveli.

Counsel A Brahma who appeared for the complainant said the incident took place at the Vagaikulam toll plaza on May 4, 2019, when Prabakaran was travelling from Tirunelveli to Tuticorin in his car. The toll plaza staff demanded Rs 90 for the two-way trip and also gave him a receipt.

“While returning from Tuticorin he saw the fare mentioned on the board for a two-way trip for cars as Rs 85,” the counsel said and added that Prabakaran brought it to the notice of the toll plaza staff and sought a refund of the excess fare of Rs 5. But the staff not only refused to return the money but also humiliated him.

The victim contacted the manager and the contractor of the toll plaza who gave him rude and humiliating replies, after which he approached the consumer forum. Along with the complaint he also submitted a copy of the receipt for the toll fare for Rs 90 and a photograph of the fare mentioned on the board. Brahma said that notices and summons were served to the manager and contractor of the toll plaza, but they did not respond to it or appear before the forum. President of the forum K Devadas and members S Sivamoorthi and M Muthulakshmi who examined the merits of the petition ordered the toll plaza management to pay Rs 20,005 to Prabakaran. This includes Rs 15,000 for causing mental agony and Rs 5,000 towards legal expenses and refund of Rs 5 that was charged excess from him.

It has to be paid within a month of the order, failing which it has to be paid with an interest of 6% per month.

Two years ago, ITC had launched four variants of healthy potatoes including natural low-sugar potatoes

AHMEDABAD: Continuing its push to promote healthier variants of potatoes, FMCG major ITC is set to begin trial cultivation of red potatoes at Chandrala village of Gandhinagar district in Gujarat. Red potatoes are a variety recently launched by the company, that are high on anthocyanin, which gives it antioxidant properties.

“Red potatoes don’t just have red skin but are red on the inside as well. This variant has all the benefits of a potatoes and additionally has anthocyanin. This variety can be used as a table variant as well as a processing variety and has a huge potential for exports,” said Sachid Madan, chief executive, Technico Agri Sciences Limited, an ITC Group company.

In the first phase, the company will work with a handful of farmers and later scale up.

Besides red potatoes, ITC has also launched purple potatoes, that currently in trial cultivation in northern India. “We plan to scale up cultivation of both red and purple potatoes to 75-80 tonnes this year. Next year, it will be scaled up to 300 tonnes,” Madan added.

The company procured red potatoes from the US while the purple variant is procured from New Zealand, through the Central Potato Research Institute (CPRI). Currently, both variants are being cultivated in Uttar Pradesh on trial basis.

Red and purple potatoes are currently available in India at specialty gourmet stores for about Rs 1,000-1,500 per kg; and are consumed at five-star hotels and upmarket restaurants, primarily in salads.

“We will be able to retail this product for much less than its current price. In the long run, cultivation of these variants of potatoes will have huge export potential given their characteristics and health benefits. They will yield high prices for farmers in Gujarat,” Madan added.

MUMBAI: In anticipation of anti-CAA and anti-NRC protests , organisers of the Queer Azaadi March , the annual pride parade that has been an expression of equal rights for LGBT individuals, have been denied police permission to host the event on February 1 at the August Kranti Maidan , where festivities commence every year before culminating at Girgaum Chowpatty.

In a letter to the organisers on Wednesday, senior inspector Rajendra Mohite of Gamdevi police station said they had received information that anti-government slogans could be raised and members of the community may come up with placards protesting the CAA and NRC.

“This might create a law and order situation resulting in a cognisable offence. If you go ahead with the rally, legal action would be taken against you,” stated the letter that also referred to a prohibitory order from January 23 to February 6, 2020 on restrictions on assembly of more than five persons under Section 37 (3) of the Mumbai Police Act, 1951. “If you carry out a rally on February 1 and if there are losses to government and private properties, you will have to pay for the damages,” the letter stated.

Earlier, a few members of Queer Azaadi—a collective of individuals and organizations working for queer causes and equal rights for the queer LGBTQ community and the main organiser of the march— were called in at the Gamdevi police station on Tuesday evening and informed of apprehensions about unrest in the name of an anti-CAA protest.

“We told the police that we cannot assure them that there will be no slogans or posters related to CAA or NRC, because it’s an issue that affects the queer and transgender people living in the margins and intersections of caste, religion and region. Although the police were polite with us while declining permissions and are concerned about any untoward incident at this year’s event that may become a deterrent for permissions next year and even tarnish the impression of the community, we expect that the police would make arrangements to ensure that people are safe and can go ahead with the march,” said LGBT rights activist Harish Iyer.

A senior police officer told TOI, “We have been allowing it at August Kranti Maidan for all these years without any objections. However, we have information that there could be anti-NRC-CAA protest and that some people were planning to carry placards. Hence we told them that we cannot grant them permission.” He added that the notified area for any kind of protest in the city is Azad Maidan.

Although activists organizing the march have failed to convince the police, they are reluctant to shift the parade to Azad Maidan as recommended by the cops, given that the pride march has historically commenced at the Gowalia Tank ever since it was first held on August 16, 2008. “This location was designed as a spot for staging our parade since it lies within highrises and lower lanes and allows us to assert our identity to a larger cross-section of people,” Iyer said. “However, we will meet on Thursday morning and decide on the future course of action.”

MYSURU: The recent clampdown on hookah bars in the city has exposed how owners are flouting the conditions under which they are allowed to serve tobacco products , under lax enforcement, even as the number of outlets continues to multiply.

The law bans smoking in public places and a separate lounge must be created for use of tobacco products or smoking. Dining cannot be allowed in such sections and the clause applies to restaurants and amusement centres, according to the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act , 2003. In fact, even water shouldn’t be served in cabins where tobacco is being consumed.

However, hookah cafes in the city openly serve tobacco products along with food and beverages. In the recent raid by the City Crime Branch, sleuths penalised three youths after they were found smoking outside the lounge. Empty beer bottles were also found on their table.

For long, Mysuru had just three hookah bars but now the count stands at 18.

The civic corporation provides trade licences to run restaurants and supply tobacco products through hookah in a separate cabin with certain stipulations, said MCC chief health officer MS Jayanth. However, there is little monitoring and enforcement after the licences are issued.

Admitting that most hookah bars in Mysuru have been violating norms, Ravikiran M, proprietor of Café Mist, among the oldest hangouts here, said violations by the later entrants was affecting those in the business for nearly a decade. Among the laid down norms, he said, are that customers should not be below 18 and food and beverages should not be served alongside hookah. “The few people who are violating it should be penalised. The rest of us have been following the rules,” he said.

157,['30/01/2020'],Scenic Aqua Line gets 81% rise in ridership on Day 2,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Nagpur: The Aqua Line of Mahametro ’s Reach III, inaugurated by the State chief minister Uddhav Thackeray a day ago, witnessed an overwhelming response from Nagpurians on the second day with a 81% increase in the ridership between Lokmanyanagar and Sitabuldi interchange.

The Mahametro authorities had made Nagpurians wait for 144 days before opening the facility for them due to unavailability of the seniormost politicians before the Thackeray scion flagged it off. Despite allowing only a half-day run between 2pm and 8pm, Mahametro had collected Rs27,492 on the first day itself with 1,659 persons using the city’s most ambitious urban mass transit system which is set to be fully operational by the end of this year connecting the east-west and also north-south corridors.

On day two, Mahametro continued to get encouraging response from Nagpurians with around 3,000 ridership garnering a revenue of around Rs50,000.

Mahametro’s first commercial run on March 7 last year on the Orange route after prime minister Narendra Modi had inaugurated it through video-link was a major draw too as Nagpurians were attracted by the facility being thrown open to them after much media hype and debate on it’s commencement.

In an official statement, Mahametro has claimed that it had got 11,000 ridership on the first day (March 7) when a revenue of Rs1.55 lakh was generated on the maiden run of the train from Sitabuldi interchange to Khapri.

Managing director of Mahametro Brijesh Dixit shared the encouraging response of the Nagpurians towards Mahametro on January 26 this year when there was over 21,000 ridership on the Orange route on a singe day. “The ridership in metro globally has a trend of rising gradually. Even Delhi metro witnessed a rise from two lakhs ridership in the initial years to 60 lakhs now after it’s journey of 18 years. So, even we are expecting and also seeing a similar trend here too,” said Dixit. He added that the people are getting attracted to metro nowadays in more numbers which will certainly rise.

Dixit said that all the possible facilities for a seamless ride in the metro are in place and more are set to come as the ridership increases. “We have adequate parking places at all the metro stations along which there is also facilities of e-rickshaws and also sharing cycle to aid the last mile connectivity,” said Dixit. “We have made exemplary pickup and drop-off points at different stations,” he said. “We also have a Memorandum of Understanding for an electric bike with a company in place and would be shortly introduced,” he said.

The Rajagopuram of the Abatsahayesvar temple

CHENNAI: The Rajagopuram of the Abatsahayesvar temple , a Chola-era structure in Thukkachi, 15km from Kumbakonam , is covered with thick vegetation and moss giving it a decrepit look.

The undergrowth, cracks, fading murals and broken sculptures make it hard to believe that the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) department of the Tamil Nadu government maintains the brick and stone structure. The temple was to get a facelift three years ago but the project was abandoned. It is believed that the original structure was built by Rajendra Chola I (AD1014-1044) and the temple was expanded later by Vikrama Chola (AD1118-1135.

""We have many magnificent Chola-era temples. However, this is a rare brick-and-stone one. The word ‘maintain’ doesn’t mean anything here, and that’s a tragedy,"" said R Gopu, a heritage activist based in Chennai. The renovation work, which began three years ago, was stopped later mainly because it was damaging the existing structure. ""The artisans lacked talent to restore the delicate brick work of this temple. The restoration work was stopped, giving way to further deterioration,"" he said.

The Abatsahayesvar temple is known for its delicate brick structure interwoven with stone pillars. ""The arrangement of bricks is done beautifully as the way it is done in stone-structured ones. The style is important as we don’t have many temples like this today. It is deteriorating day by day,"" said R Vishwanathan, who teaches painting to the students of department of visual communication at Chennai’s National Science & Arts College. Three years ago, when Vishwanathan visited the temple, the murals of Lord Shiva and the ceiling were in a bad shape. Many who visit the temple still don’t know the significance associated with the Chola-era murals. ""They are in ruins and no one has taken any step to preserve them. These are rare pieces of art belonging to the Chola era. If we don’t take care of them now, they will disappear soon,"" he said.

The photographs of the ruins of Abatsahayesvar temple are disturbing. ""I don’t know whether the HR&CE is aware of it. The state government must take immediate steps to renovate the temple. Otherwise, the photographs will remain an example of the government’s apathy when it comes to conservation of heritage sites,"" said Vishwanathan.

MADURAI: Health officials have removed 12 waste bins from ward number eight and nine recently after door-to-door waste collection was introduced by the corporation. Officials say that littering on public places was not noticed so far after the bins were removed. It was because of the meticulous collection of waste from the doorsteps.

Sanitary officer for zone one of Madurai Corporation N Vijayakumar said that waste bins are an eye sore as the issue of garbage overflowing from it cannot be addressed. Cities are moving towards waste bin free culture as it is the future, and the same is being encouraged here under the solid waste management rules.

City health officer (in-charge) Dr S Senthil Kumar said that they are already in the process of clearing waste bins in various parts of the city. Once the door-to-door waste collection is streamlined and construction of all MCCs is completed, there will not be any waste bin in the city. People will be sensitized on it, he said.

Officials said that non-biodegradable waste is also being collected on a daily-basis. They are shifted to Vellaikkal solid waste management centre, where they are segregated into reusable and non-reusable waste, before scientifically disposing them.

Telangana CM K Chandrashekhar Rao

HYDERABAD: After the urban local bodies elections, now the state is going to witness another major election. Chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao has instructed officials to hold elections to the primary agriculture cooperative societies (PACS) immediately.

He asked the officials to issue a notification for PACS in the next three to four days as the term for person in-charge of the societies is coming to an end soon. The CM asked officials to complete the election process within 15 days, and told them the newly elected bodies should be formed.

Buoyed with winning series of elections, including municipal elections, the state government has reportedly taken decision to go for cooperative elections. As of now, only 353 mandals have primary agricultural societies. While 272 mandals have single PACS, 81 mandals did not have any PACS in united AP.

Recently, the state government has decided to strengthen the cooperative system by sanctioning new PACS. According to the government orders, mandals which do not have PACS will get two societies, while those already having one will get another.

Agriculture department officials said that by strengthening PACS, in which farmers are members, the government is planning to involve PACS in implementing schemes like Rythu Bandhu and irrigation schemes, and rural credit system.

NASHIK: The death toll in the head-on collision between a Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) bus and a six-seater autorickshaw in Nashik district’s Deola taluka has gone up to 26.

Of the 37 injured admitted in hospitals in Deola, Umrane and Malegaon, 32 have been discharged. At present, four people are still undergoing treatment at the Malegaon sub-district hospital.

The mishap had taken place near the Dahiwad village at around 3.30 pm on Tuesday. After the coalition, both the vehicles fell into a private well.

Nashik rural SP Arti Singh told TOI that altogether 26 people — 17 onboard the bus and all nine in the autorickshaw — have died in the mishap. The deceased included 14 women/girls. “The last body that was recovered from the well was that of a two-year-old girl at around 10 am on Wednesday,” said Singh, who was stationed at the mishap spot till late on Tuesday night. She said the identities of the deceased have been established and the bodies have been handed over to the bereaved families.

The deceased who were onboard the MSRTC bus hailed from various parts of the region as the bus had originated from Dhule and was on his way to Deola via Malegaon. Singh said the local police was in the process of filing an FIR against Prakash Bacchav, the deceased bus driver, as he was allegedly responsible for the mishap.

“The bus was moving at a considerable speed — even while negotiating the curve near the accident spot. The driver should have slowed down. But as he was speeding, the vehicle entered the lane meant for vehicles coming from the opposite direction and rammed into the autorickshaw. The autorickshaw was moving at normal speed,” said Singh.

The initial feedback that the rural police received said that one of the tyres of the bus had burst. “Officials from the Nashik Regional Transport Office (RTO) will examine the damaged bus to ascertain if there were any technical problems,” added Singh.

According to sistrict civil surgeon Dr Suresh Jagdale, autopsies of the deceased people revealed that in the majority of the cases, the victims had died either due to drowning or head injuries. “The four who are still admitted at Malegaon Hospital are out of danger. They have sustained fractures,” added Dr Jagdale.

District collector Suraj Mandhare too went to the accident site and met the injured people.

The autorickshaw fell into the well first and the bus fell on top of it. “It was a challenge for the rescuers to take out the two vehicles as the bus had fallen vertically into the well. Moreover, a large crowd had gathered near the well, and the police had to keep them at bay to carry out the rescue operations,” said Arti Singh.

A team from National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Pune, reached the site at 2 am on Wednesday to assist the local rescue team. “The local team did a good job in rescuing the survivors. Our divers went inside the well water and brought out three bodies. The oil leakage from the vehicles posed problems in finding the bodies. But we eventually took them out,” said NDRF sources.

Aurangabad: Three offences were registered in the city against protesters taking part in Bharat Bandh, called by Bahujan Kranti Morcha and backed by multiple organisations against the CAA, NRC and NPR, on Wednesday

The cases were registered for taking out a vehicle rally without permission, breaking the window pane of a bus and damaging a video camera of police’s special branch and allegedly manhandling the cop in civil dress, said police.

Elsewhere in the eight districts of Marathwada, the bandh received a good response, with many business establishments remaining closed till 5pm.

Aurangabad city police said three offences were registered against protesters for taking out a vehicle rally without permission, for breaking the window pane of a bus and damaging a video camera of police’s special branch and allegedly manhandling the cop in civil dress.

City police commissioner Chiranjeev Prasad said, “Barring some minor incidents, the bandh ended peacefully. We are registering offences for the violations that have come to our notice.”

Business areas like Connaught market, Osmanpura, Gulmandi, Paithan Gate and Kranti Chowk witnessed some friction after bike-borne protesters allegedly forced the shop owners to keep their shutters down.

The police patrol teams, including those led by senior officers, took swift action to avert trouble. Police used mild force when the protesters tried to create problems at the Central bus stand.

Aurangabad range comprising Aurangabad rural, Jalna, Beed and Osmanabad, had a considerable response to the bandh. Apart from these, the authorities informed that there was a good response in Partur, Bhokardan, Mantha, Jalna town in Jalna district, Kannad, Sillod, Phulambri in Aurangabad rural, Majalgaon, Parli, Beed town, Ambejogai in Beed district and some parts of Osmanabad district.

Range’s special inspector general of police Ravinder Kumar Singal told TOI, “We had deployed the required bandobast in the four districts. The day passed off peacefully without any major incident in our range.”

The bandh received comparatively more response from two districts of Nanded range comprising Nanded, Hingoli, Parbhani and Latur districts. Several areas in Nanded and Parbhani observed day-long bandh and things started to return to normalcy in the evening.

“Considering the recent violent incidents resulting from anti-CAA, NPR, NRC protests, the bandh being observed peacefully on Wednesday remained our priority,” said a senior officer.

Thrissur: Professor T J Joseph , former HoD of Malayalam department at Newman College in Thodupuzha whose hand was chopped off by activists of Popular Front of India in 2010, received an apology from P T Kunju Mohammed on Wednesday. Ten years after the incident, they met for the first time in Thrissur on the day Joseph released his book titled ‘Attupokatha Ormakal’.

“After the hand chopping case, Islamophobia increased in Kerala. It is sad that the Muslim community has not condemned the incident all this while,” said Mohammed.

Joseph had set the controversial question paper after selecting a passage from Mohammed’s short story for an internal exam in Malayalam for second semester BCom students. PFI members had then alleged that he had ridiculed Prophet Muhammad and attacked him when he was returning home from church with his family on July 4, 2010.

“When the question paper controversy erupted, the church and college officials gave me support. After a high-level meeting of church authorities, everybody changed their stand and I was left alone. Nobody visited me or offered help,” said Joseph, claiming that the church tried to portray him as a ‘terrorist’. The autobiography spanning 431 pages describes how the issue changed his life and how he survived the ordeal.

173,['30/01/2020'],450 RFOs promoted but not regularized,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Nagpur: Discontent is brewing among the forest cadres involved in wildlife and forest protection as the state government is apathetic to their demands. The cadre includes right from forest guards to range forest officers (RFOs).

In the first case, RFOs are up in arms as the government is sitting over the proposal to regularize promotion of 450 RFOs. These officials were promoted from round officers to RFOs from 2011 to 2018.

The date of RFOs who were elevated in 2011 was considered as July 21, 2017. Aggrieved RFOs challenged this decision in the Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal (MAT).

In 2018, the tribunal directed the forest department to regularize promotions depending on the available quota of promotion of foresters to RFOs. However, the state has failed to regularize promotion of 450 RFOs due to which fear of they being reverted looms large.

Meanwhile, the forest department on Wednesday issued a circular to conduct promotional exam for foresters. But aggrieved 450 RFOs have demanded their promotion should be regularized first before taking any such decision.

In another development, Ajay Patil, the central president of Maharashtra State Forest Guards and Promoted Foresters Union, has urged APCCF (administration & subordinate cadre) Vikas Gupta to meet the long-pending demands of foresters and guards.

“Treating foresters at par with police personnel is the long pending demand of the cadre. We want 5% reservation to kin of forest employees in recruitment on the lines of police,” said Patil.

Patil said foresters and guards have a key role to play in wildlife and forest protection. One of the demands include providing motorcycles for patrolling, medical facilities at cashless hospitals and no discrimination in transfers.

The forest union leader also demanded to reward field staff for outstanding work. The illegal forest produce and material and vehicles seized in forest crimes should be sold and the receipts should be used for the welfare of filed staff.

Patil also demanded to provide identity cards to guards and foresters and an additional copy of service book. The APCCF has promised to consider the demands of field staff and do a follow up with the state government officials.

HYDERABAD: Fed up with the daily torture by his alcoholic father, a 16-year-old boy allegedly bludgeoned him to death at their house in Kothagattu village in Karimnagar district on Wednesday. The deceased was identified as Syed Madar, 40, a stone-cutter from Kothagattu.

On Tuesday night, Madar came home drunk. “Madar brought country chicken at 11pm and woke up his children who were fast asleep. He forced them to cook chicken. Madar’s elder son abused him and he told his other children that he would kill the boy soon. Around 12 midnight, Madar fell asleep in front of his house next to the stove without having dinner while his children were preparing chicken curry. Upon noticing that his father was fast asleep, his elder son threw a boulder on Madar’s head and killed him on the spot,” ACP, Huzurabad, S Srinivasa Rao said.

In 2012, Madar killed his first wife by throttling her while staying in Dharmasagar area of Warangal district.

Officials said that one tonne of waste is enough to generate 40 to 50 kg of manure

MADURAI: The micro composting centre (MCC) set up at Thathaneri, which started processing garbage by the end of October, 2019, has helped in clearing the misconception of residents about such centres in a big way.

The Thathaneri centre, one among the 41 micro composting centres proposed by Madurai Corporation in various parts of the city to decentralize waste management at a cost of Rs 33.50 crore, was set up to process waste collected from every door steps in ward number eight and nine. Since then, it has been busy churning out organic manure without any sanitation issues.

People have been raising objection to set up MCCs in their localities, as they are under the misconception that it will lead to bad hygiene and emanate foul smell in the residential areas. But, the MCCs set up at Thathaneri, Tirunagar and Menendal are going to change the perception of the people in the city, said officials from the health department of Madurai Corporation.

City health officer (in-charge), Madurai Corporation, Dr S Senthil Kumar told TOI that at the centre, garbage is treated in a scientific manner and converted into organic manure, which is best suited for all sorts of farming and terrace gardening. He said that construction of six more MCCs has also been completed and they will start functioning soon.

Zone One sanitary officer N Vijayakumar while explaining the process said that waste is segregated as bio-degradable and non-biodegradable at source. A light commercial vehicle is being deployed for every 800 to 1,000 houses. Bio-degradable waste is brought to MCC, where it is cut into pieces before duping into well ventilated pits. Effective microorganism solution prepared using water, jaggery and curd is sprinkled on waste to help bacteria grow faster, which will turn waste into manure in 40 days, he said.

The growth of worms was a challenge for the officials in the process. G Senthil Kumar, a daily waged supervisor of the unit, came up with a simple and effective solution to keep the issue in check. He introduced hens to eat the worms. They are good nutrients for hens and it also helped daily-wage workers to make a bit more money through it.

Officials said that one tonne of waste is enough to generate 40 to 50 kg of manure. Thathaneri, the first MCC opened, has produced around 50 tonnes of manure so far. Around 20 tonnes of it has been distributed to residents and small-scale farmers for free. “We only recently came to know that manure is produced here. We were surprised to know that it is being given free of cost. We have received a bag full of manure to be used for tree saplings,” said S Manickam from Ponmeni

The workers have proved the quality of the manure already. They have utilized it to raise vegetables in a barren piece of land formed by dumping construction waste next to the Thathaneri MCC. All the plants have grown well and started yielding vegetables.

AHMEDABAD: White-topping, or laying a layer of concrete over existing bitumen roads, is a long-term solution for pothole free travel in cities, says the Indian Concrete Institute . This road-building technology is about 40% more expensive than conventional bitumen roads, but ensures pothole-free roads for 20 years, the ICI said.

Retired principal secretary, PWD, Maharashtra, P L Bongirwar, who has been instrumental in implementing white-topping in cities in Maharashtra, said that apart from ensuring pothole-free roads, white-topping has several other benefits such as fuel efficiency of vehicles, reducing temperatures and ensuring road safety.

“The latest research shows that square concrete slabs measuring one metre by one metre, with a thickness of 20cm, not only handle changes in temperature better, but are strong enough to last for at least 20 years,” said Bongriwar, who supervised completion of the Mumbai-Pune expressway as joint managing director of the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation .

HYDERABAD: An accused in a dacoity case, who has been on the run and evading police dragnet for 35 years, was finally nabbed by cops in Nizamabad district on Wednesday. He was produced before a court in Karimnagar and sent to judicial remand.

V Bhumaiah, now 67, was accused of committing a dacoity in Gundlapalli village of Ganneruvaram in Karimnagar district in 1985. “After committing the offence, Bhumaiah fled from the village and took shelter at various places in Telangana to avoid arrest. He also worked at some places by concealing his identity,” Karimnagar commissioner of police VB Kamalasan Reddy said.

Recently, two constables of Ganneruvaram — T Komuraiah and A Sampath — who went to execute warrants in Gundlapalli came to know that Bhumaiah had returned to his native place of Bheemgal in Nizamabad district.

Kamalasan said the two cops went to Bheemgal town and made discreet enquiries about Bhumaiah’s whereabouts. They caught him and executed the pending warrant against him. “He was produced before the court in Karimanagar,” the commissioner said. He also said the two constables and sub-inspector of Ganneruvaram A Tirupati would be suitably rewarded for catching the dacoit after a 35-year long search.

PANAJI: The state government has asked the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (GSIDC) to submit a design and an estimate for the roofing of the Kala Academy open-air auditorium to protect it from rain, said art and culture minister Govind Gaude.The tender will be floated after the code of conduct is lifted, which will be enforced for the zilla panchayat elections.“We have asked GSIDC to give us an estimate of the expenditure for the construction of the roof. If the roofing is not done, the structure will collapse. We have requested the high court to permit us to install a roof over the open-air auditorium, and the Charles Correa Foundation (CCF) doesn’t have any objection either,” Gaude said.Built by renowned architect Charles Correa, the Kala Academy structure had started to show dampness in many places during monsoon, while its open-air auditorium was leaking.IIT-Madras professor Radhakrisha Pillai had recently held a meeting with Kala Academy officials and said that there is no need for the open-air auditorium to be demolished, instead it can be repaired using the cathodic protection technology to arrest further deterioration of steel.“The IIT-Madras expert was called by CCF. But we have the Goa Engineering College (GEC) and GEM Engserv reports which state that the structure is in a deteriorated condition and requires speedy remedies. The matter is currently in the high court, so we cannot do much,” Gaude said.Pillai carried out an inspection of Kala Academy and ascertained that the primary issue was that of multiple layers of waterproofing, which has led to a dead load.Gaude said, “About 10 years ago, CCF was asked to allow Kala Academy to install a roof, but they were worried that the face of the institution would be obstructed. They gave us alternate solutions like waterproofing.”He added that Kala Academy will be opened for activities tentatively from March 1 to May 31, subject to the next date of the high court hearing. “However, we will be able to take a major decision by September. As far as the safety of the open-air auditorium is concerned, we don’t use the (open-air auditorium) premises owing to its deterioration,” he said.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73754625,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-677872,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-looks-at-building-roof-over-ka-open-air-auditorium/articleshow/73745928.cms

Thrissur: The 12th edition of the International Theatre Festival of Kerala ( ITFoK ) drew to a close on Wednesday. Editor of the CPM organ Deshabhimani and former MP P Rajeev, who delivered the concluding address, said strengthening cultural interventions was vital to retain the secular fabric of the country.

Rajeev recalled that there were intense ideological confrontations between those who wanted to make India a unitary religious state and those who argued that the country must uphold the values of diversity and secularisation even during the freedom struggle.

The advocates of diversity and secularism had gained the upper hand then and Independent India chose to adopt such a Constitution. But systematic efforts are being made now to undermine those vital credentials of Independent India, and cultural practices can play an important role in the combat against those trying to decimate the secular values, Rajeev said.

Emphasising that the importance of political dimension of plays, he said that theatre must focus on finer aspects and nuances of the political interventions.

Sahithya Academy president and writer Vaisakhan, Sangeetha Nataka Academy chairperson KPAC Lalitha took part in the event. Sangeetha Nataka Academy secretary N Radhakrishnan Nair announced that Amitesh Grover, who was the director of ITFoK this year will continue to hold the post for the next edition also.

Riyadh: The Indian government has reduced the e-visa rate by half for citizens of Saudi Arabia. The rates for visa with one-month validity has been reduced to $25 from $50. Charges for multiple entry visa with one-year validity has been reduced to $40 from $80. The cost of obtaining a multiple entry tourist visa with a validity of five years is $80, a source in Indian diplomatic mission said.

Indian authorities had last year introduced e-visas for Saudi nationals visiting the country. The procedure was approved during a meeting between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Indian PM Narendra Modi in February 2019.

According to officials, introduction of e-visa facility has streamlined visa processing. It has also helped Saudi citizens living in remote villages submit applications online instead of travelling to Riyadh or Jeddah. Processing of visa for Saudi citizens visiting India for purposes like health, tourism and business have also been simplified. A Saudi citizen can now submit visa application just four days ahead of India visit.

In 2019, Indian government had issued 19,116 online visas and 18,598 paper visas to Saudi citizens.

Transport minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar said 4,000 TSRTC buses will be operated for Medaram festival

MEDARAM: Some 12,000 police personnel will be deployed to ensure the ensuing four-day biennial Sammakka Saralamma jatara , scheduled to begin on February 5, is conducted smoothly.

Inspector general (IG), North Zone, Y Nagi Reddy, along with Mulugu superintendent of police Sangramsingh G Patil, inspected the security arrangements for the tribal fair at Medaram on Wednesday.

The police will monitor the security arrangements and flow of devotees through 350 CCTV cameras from the Command and Control Room. Reddy said that 100 two-wheelers have been provided to policemen to reach troublesome spots as soon as possible.

He said that their focus will be on crowd management. Special officers have been deployed for crowd management at the altars and to monitor the traffic movement. One-way restriction on routes leading to Medaram will be imposed to avoid traffic snarls, he said.

Devotees arriving in vehicles from Warangal have to take Pasra and Narlapur route to reach Medaram. On their return, they have to take the route of Bhupalpally and Parkal. VVIP vehicles and RTC buses will have to go to Medaram via Tadvai, and take the same route on return journey, the IG said. He advised devotees not to halt their vehicles on the roads as it could lead to congestion. Motorists must stop their vehicles only at designated parking spots.

Meanwhile, the fire department has also chalked out its plans for the jatara. Divisional fire officer, M Bhagavan Reddy, said 11 fire fighters have been made available at Medaram. This apart, nine mist bullets (fire extinguishers on two-wheelers) will also be used to put off minor fires. He said fire engines have been deployed at Chilukalagutta, the altars, Jampanna Vagu, RTC bus station, helipad, Narlapur, and at Tadvai.

182,['30/01/2020'],Telangana: Sub inspector gets four-week jail for illegal arrest,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Representative image

HYDERABAD: Justice MS Ramachandra Rao of the high court has convicted SR Nagar police sub inspector Ashok Naik in a contempt case. The judge sentenced him to four weeks in jail for not following procedure laid down in subsection (1) of 41-A of CrPC and for arresting a person even though the law says that an arrest is unwarranted in crimes that carry less than seven years of jail terms.

The judge also slapped a fine of Rs 2,000 on the SI for acting in a manner that is contrary to the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court in the Arnesh Kumar case. The judge pronounced this order in a contempt case filed by Ramadugu Omkar Varma, the owner of a stationary shop in Borabanda of Hyderabad. The SI arrested him following a complaint from one K Padma of the same area, who charged varma with cheating her in the name of hidden treasure in her house. He took Rs 10,000 from her to dig out the treasure. He did dig for some days, but later disappeared “without unearthing the promised hidden treasure”.

The judge described the FIR as vague because it did not contain the details of when Varma met Padma, the dates of cash delivery, and the digging at the house. None of these offences are punishable for more than seven years, and hence arrest is not required. No material was placed to substantiate the claims of the SI that the accused had cheated another woman in a similar manner. The judge suspended the sentence for six weeks to allow the convict to avail his legal remedies.

183,['30/01/2020'],"Prolonged monsoon stings bees, takes hum out of moringa farming","This story is from January 30, 2020

NASHIK: The hum of the honeybees in his drumstick (moringa) fields is music to Mahesh Pawar’s ears. This harvest season, the sound was missing from his fields in Malegaon near Nashik . That’s when he turned to a bee farmer to bring boxful of the pollinators.

Hundreds of farmers like Pawar were left worried after the prolonged monsoon, accompanied by the aggressive use of pesticides endangered the natural bees, who are essential pollinators.

“Drumstick crop requires the October heat for growth and honeybees for pollination. This year, there were hardly any honeybees. More the honeybees on the farm, better the yield. I finally got a honeybee box from a farmer to help in the blossoming of drumstick flowers and prevent drops,” Pawar said.

The authorities of the Bee Keeping and Training Institute, Mahabaleshwar, confirmed that only 25% of natural bees had returned to their colonies in 2019.

“Prolonged and heavy monsoon resulted in excessive use of pesticides, which have killed a multitude of honeybees this year. It has harmed the insect to an extent that is unimaginable to laymen,” officials at the institute told TOI.

Such sudden disappearance of bees on a large scale was first noticed in 2006 in the United States, where beekeepers noticed empty hives. It became known as the ‘colony collapse disorder’, something that could have a serious effect on farming and cultivation.

Honeybees are required for ‘flower setting’ in crops such as drumsticks, pomegranate, onion and coffee. They are essential for coffee plantation, as the insects must pollinate in the three days that the coffee flowers are in bloom. Also, cucumber cannot be grown without honeybees.

Many farmers in Maharashtra have turned to drumstick or moringa farming for the high income it offers. The flowers, leaves and drumsticks, all have medicinal and healing properties, and the plant is globally considered a superfood among the superfoods.

Nashik district alone has about 2,000 acres of drumstick farms. Farmers are facing at least 30% drop in production this year. Already, the humble drumstick is selling at Rs 350 per kg in Mumbai and Pune markets instead of the usual price of Rs 100 per kg.

A home for the bees

Much like Sherlock Holmes, who became a beekeeper after his retirement, farmers in various parts of Maharashtra have taken up ‘bee farming’. It means rearing bees and selling or renting the colonies to farmers during the key pollination days.

Nanasaheb Ingale from Ahmednagar began honey bee farming in 2012, which was his childhood dream since he had watched a television show 20 years back about honeybee rearing. Instead of buying honeybees for his 40-acre pomegranate farm, he decided to take a fortnightly course at Mahabaleshwar and then at Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh that made him rear honeybees and help the nearby farmers spreading awareness about the right usage of it. “The number of farmers renting honeybee colonies for their farms has increased by 50% this year. One farmer took two colonies from me on his bike late night. The colonies can be taken only after dark.”

Drumstick farmers at Amravati, Akola, Yeolkhed have also been experimenting with the honeybee intervention in their farms.

Tukaram Nikam, the owner of Organic Bee Farm, said he has been farming bees since 1997 after getting a month-long training in apiculture from Israel. “In the past two months, the farmers have started buying colonies for their farms as they require them round the year for the varieties of drumsticks.”

Nikam suggests that farmers should grow big trees as border crops, where honeybees can make their hives and spray non-poisonous pesticides before or after 9 am to 5 pm. Honey bees return to the hives after dark and that is when the boxes can be transported without the fear of the sting.

Gaining popularity

The Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University in Nashik is set to launch its new certificate course on apiculture – rearing and management of honey bees – this year.

YCMOU officials said the new six-month course would kick off from this academic year in June 2020 for which the admissions will start from March. Initially, it will be a certificate course but can be converted into a diploma course if there is a good response from the students.

Raosaheb Patil, Dean, Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), YCMOU said: “The Government of India has instructed all the KVKs to promote apiculture as the honey bee rearing has its own benefits for various crops.”

The course will run in all the 63 centres of YCMOU spread in the state. The varsity will come up with a practical book as well as a textbook for the course.

184,['30/01/2020'],"In this non-Muslim village, Hindus preserve a 200-year old dargah","This story is from January 30, 2020

Bharat Dagal and Paresh Rabari offering prayers at the dargah before their marriage ceremony

SAVARKUNDLA (AMRELI): Weddings and extensive rituals go hand in hand. But in Khadasali village, 30 km from Savarkundla in Amreli district , religious beliefs take a step beyond. Here, no vows are exchanged — be it a Hindu wedding or a Muslim one — without first paying obeisance at the Peer Baba dargah.

And, so it’s no surprise seeing SRP jawan Mahesh Bagda religiously doing the rounds of the dargah for the past 10 days praying for a ‘happily ever after’ wedding and bright career. Bagda is set to tie the knots on Thursday.

This is a tradition that has no exception and brides and grooms not only from Khadasali but also from nearby villages make a beeline to the dargah before embarking on their conjugal journey. In fact, the dargah plays a crucial role on all auspicious work. Locals do not initiate any work without praying at the dargah.

So, why is Khadasali dargah different, when Hindus visiting dargahs is not an uncommon practice?

Peer Baba dargah stands tall in a village comprising 1,500 people, which doesn’t have a single member from the Muslim community. That’s the difference. Patels and Brahmins have been preserving this shrine, praying here regularly for nearly 200 years now.

Khadasali truly shines as example of communal amity especially amid the acrimonious politics over the destruction of shrines and religious intolerance.

“This dargah is as old as our 200-year-old village. Forget razing it, Patels, Brahmins and people other castes ensure that it is well maintained. Villagers’ faith in the dargah keeps it alive,” said Chetan Malani, young sarpanch of Khadasali. Interestingly, the village also houses around 10 temples of various gods and community deities.

Bharat Dagal, who got married on Tuesday, said, “We belonging to the Rabari community, but our family went there to seek blessings at the dargah before my marriage. We have immense faith in Peer Bapa.”

Each believer to his own: During Navrati and Chaitri Navratri, Hindu devotees distribute sweets only after offering naivedya (food offering for god) at this tomb. Farmers start sowing only after praying to Peer Baba for a bountiful harvest,” said Malani.

Around eight years ago when the villagers decided to give the dargah a facelift, local social worker Nalini Bhatt funded the tomb’s reconstruction, while the family of late Kanubhai Vaghadiya, a Patel, funded the construction of its boundary walls.

“All villagers helped rebuild the dargah through community service,” Malani added.

CHENNAI: Visitors at the ongoing India Tourist and Industrial Fair are shelling out huge sums of money to park vehicles at the venue, Island Grounds. A flat parking charge of Rs 50 for two-wheelers and Rs 100 for cars, which is on a par with parking fee collected in upscale malls, is unfair, visitors complained.

City resident S Ramu, who visited the tourist fair on his motorcycle on Tuesday, said he was shocked at seeing the expensive parking rates. “The charges have been hiked by Rs 20 compared to last year. Fleecing visitors with parking charges that are on the lines of malls is unacceptable,” he said.

Yet another visitor, Kalidass of Korukkupet, said charging Rs 50 to park two-wheelers was unreasonable.

According to sources, around 600 two-wheelers and 200 cars are parked at Island Grounds on weekdays and the figures double during weekends and public holidays. While a permanent parking lot is available at the entrance near Muthusamy Bridge, two more parking lots are available at the Kamarajar Salai entry for the fair.

The two month-long fair that was inaugurated on December 21,2019, has had 4.7 lakh people visiting the pavilions of various state government departments, trying out amusement rides and shops.

Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation (TTDC) sources said the India Tourist and Industrial Fair has been outsourced to a private agency for Rs 4.8 crore this year. The agency offers amusement rides and spaces for shops on rent at the fair premises. “They have fixed the parking charges based on parking fee norms of the Greater Chennai Corporation . While the civic body’s parking charges are on hourly basis, the parking rates at Island Grounds is for the entire day,” the official said.

The civic body’s parking fare is Rs 5 per hour for two-wheelers and Rs 20 an hour for cars. Assuming that an individual spends four hours at the fair, a two-wheeler rider needs to pay only Rs 20, while car owners will pay Rs 80 according to the tariff fixed by Greater Chennai Corporation . However, visitors end up paying more due to the expensive flat parking charges at the fair.

When contacted, a TTDC official said there was no agreement signed over fixing the parking fee between TTDC and the private agency. “The agency can be asked to revise the parking fares,” the official added.

It is from a speech delivered during an election rally in west Delhi’s Madipur on January 25.In the video clip, Singh is heard comparing Kejriwal to conman Natwarlal and Pakistan-backed terrorists. “A Natwarlal (conman) like Kejriwal and a terrorist like Kejriwal are hiding in this country. We are forced to think whether we should fight with the Pakistan-backed terrorists in Kashmir or with Kejriwal-like terrorists.”Responding to Singh’s name-calling, Kejriwal said he had faced many difficulties while working for the welfare of the people of Delhi and in return BJP has called him a “terrorist”. Aam Aadmi Party said that by calling Kejriwal a terrorist, BJP had insulted two crore people of Delhi. “I worked day and night for the people of Delhi in the past five years. I sacrificed everything for the people of Delhi. I faced a lot of difficulties after coming into politics so that I can make the life of people better. In return, BJP is calling me a terrorist. It hurts,” tweeted Kejriwal in an emotional response.In a complaint submitted to Delhi’s chief electoral officer, AAP demanded an FIR against Singh for violating the model code of conduct with his remarks and sought a blanket ban on him from campaigning for the state assembly elections.Unrepentant and standing by his remarks, Singh told TOI: “AAP is standing with Shaheen Bagh from where demands for a free Kashmir, ‘Jinnahwali Azadi’ and calls for Jihad have been raised. Kejriwal is the chief of Aam Aadmi Party. Such demands can be made only by a terrorist.”Last week, deputy CM and AAP leader Manish Sisodia had said on a TV channel that he stands with the Shaheen Bagh protesters. Kejriwal had urged senior BJP leaders to visit Shaheen Bagh, talk to the protesters for resolving the issue and get a critical road in South Delhi opened.AAP functionary and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh slammed the BJP MP, saying that the saffron party was continuously using objectionable language against AAP because they have no roadmap of development in their mind. He said BJP has realised that they will not be able to win this election against AAP and, therefore, they have taken leave of their senses.Along with the complaint to the CEO, AAP also submitted a CD containing the controversial speech. “This is an allegation aimed at tarnishing the image of Arvind Kejriwal, a democratically elected chief minister and national convener of AAP, equating him with the anti-national forces fighting the state of India,” AAP stated in the complaint.At a press conference, Sanjay Singh lashed out at the BJP MP. “Kejriwal has got 20,000 new classrooms constructed and completely reformed education in Delhi. He opened mohalla clinics, and the BJP MP has called him a terrorist,” Singh said. He pointed out that Kejriwal started the Farishte Dilli Ke scheme and asked people to act as Good Samaritans to save lives of accident victims without caring about the medical expenses. “He started a free pilgrimage scheme to allow senior citizens to visit Rameswaram, Tirupati, Shirdi, Ajmer Sharif, Vaishno Devi and other religious places and another scheme to provide Rs 1 crore assistance to dependents of martyrs, and the BJP MP called him a terrorist,” the AAP MP added.The AAP leader said people of Delhi will give a reply to BJP by making AAP win this election with a historic majority on February 8.",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73754305,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-820186,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi-assembly-elections/parvesh-calls-cm-terrorist-aap-moves-poll-body/articleshow/73746110.cms

GHAZIABAD: A 27-year-old woman who returned from China recently has been put on quarantine by the health department, which has sent her samples to be tested for the Wuhan coronavirus The woman is a resident of Mayur Vihar in east Delhi but was quarantined by a Ghaziabad health department team that tracked her down to a house in Indirapuram where she had gone to meet a friend. People who have recently returned from China are all being tracked to see if they have any symptoms of the Wuhan coronavirus, whose outbreak in the eponymous Chinese city has triggered a global health scare.Officials said the woman had returned to India from China on January 20. She visited Indirapuram to meet a friend on Tuesday. Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad, said he was informed of the woman’s visit by the health department in Lucknow following which a quick response team was rushed to the flat where she was staying. She was not taken to hospital but quarantined in the apartment “as a precautionary measure” as test reports are awaited.“She complained of body ache and also had fever. Therefore, as a precautionary measure, we decided to put her in quarantine at the flat itself and sent her test samples to Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital in Delhi,” Gupta said, adding her condition was being monitored round the clock by the health department’s quick response team that was stationed at the flat.At least three other persons, including a 24-year-old student who returned from China recently, are quarantined at RML hospital for suspected coronavirus infection. All of them have cold, cough and fever. Hospital authorities said their test samples have been sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune and the results are awaited.Like seasonal influenza, which is quite common these days, coronavirus infection also spreads from an infected person to others through air, by coughing and sneezing or through close personal contact.The disease has spread to at least 15 countries, including the US, Japan, Thailand, Singapore and Nepal. In India, no positive case has been reported so far but the government is on high alert and multiple ministries are meeting regularly to chalk out strategies to prevent the spread of the disease and prepare a roadmap to deal with any crisis.The Wuhan illness, as the coronavirus infection is being described, is of the same family that caused MERS-CoV or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus infections, which was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has since spread to 26 countries.",ghaziabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73751952,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-185339,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/woman-quarantined-coronavirus-tests-on/articleshow/73746156.cms

The farm in Thebchada village where the murder was committed

RAJKOT: A three-decade old land dispute , which was adjudicated by Supreme Court , ended in a brutal murder of a 57-year-old man who had got the possession of the land. Surprisingly, he was murdered despite the presence of around 10 policemen who had accompanied him as per procedure following the court order.

On Wednesday evening, a dozen-odd persons hacked to death Lakhdhirsinh Jadeja in Thebchada village where he had gone to take the land possession after Supreme Court had ruled in his favour, police said.

“On Wednesday evening, the Jadejas went to take possession of the land accompanied by 10-odd policemen from Aji Dam police station led by inspector A S Chawda. Ten members of the Koli family led by Chhagan and Magan allegedly attacked the Jadejas with swords, scythes, axes and iron pipes. The Jadejas were taken to Rajkot Civil Hospital, where Lakhdhirsinh succumbed to his injuries,” said H L Rathod, assistant commissioner of police (Rajkot east).

His two cousins - Harendrasinh Jadeja (50) and Balwantsinh Jadeja (50) - were seriously injured in the attack. Around 10-12 assailants led by Chhagan Koli and his brother Magan were attacked them with swords, scythes, axes and iron pipes.

The Kolis had allegedly usurped the land belonging to the Jadejas and the land dispute had reached the court. In 2016, the Supreme Court ordered that the possession of the land be given to the Jadejas, police sources said.

The Kolis also moved the SC demanding three months time to reap the harvest of standing crop. However, they took 10 months. When the Jadejas moved the apex court with an application, the SC ordered the Rajkot collector and Rajkot police commissioner to give the possession of the land to the Jadejas.

Soon after the crime, the police swung into action and nabbed 12 members of the Koli family including Chhagan and Magan.

Aurangabad: Samvidhan Bachav Mahasabha’s meet to protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and National register of Citizens (NRC) on Wednesday saw the participation of different political, social and student activists.

Organised by as many as 54 different organizations, the public meeting was addressed by former judge of Bombay high court Justice B J Kolse Patil, housing minister Jitendra Awhad, Maulana Abu Talib Rahmani of the Muslim Personal Law Board, social activist Teesta Setalwad and JNU student leader Dipsita Dhar.

Awhad said the fight against CAA, NPR and NRC may appear to be small, but it is the beginning of the second ‘War of Independence’. Addressing the crowd, Avhad said the Hindus and Muslims have joined hands against the regime. First, the BJP conducted an unsuccessful NRC in Assam to win elections. But it ended up by pitting Bengalis against Assamese. BJP is just creating divisions between communities, he said.

Justice Kolse Patil said: “In a way, we should thank Narendra Modi for bringing us together.” Saying that he had evidence of atrocities committed by Modi and Shah, Justice Patil got the crowd chanting anti-Modi/Shah slogans. He alleged that the BJP has destroyed many institutions — from banks to bureaucracy — as well as employment opportunities. “They are frightening us in the name of Muslims, but people have realized their designs,” he said.

While referring to the Shaheen Bagh agitation, Dipsita Dhar, said now there are Shaheen Baghs everywhere. She said the RSS-BJP designs would not work as diversity still prevails in the country and the Constitution is the binding factor.

PATNA: An unidentified criminal gunned down an associate professor of T P S College in the city on Wednesday. The deceased, Shivnarayan Ram (52), was on his way to the college on foot when a criminal shot him in his head near Janta flats at Postal Park under Kankarbagh police station around 11am and escaped.

Vadodara: After legislators complained that civic body officials were not listening to them, a similar incident has sparked a row at the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC).

The issue of cleaning and levelling a depression in the Kishanwadi area led to the situation heating up after it was not attended despite promise by the civic body officials.

The depression in Jhanda Chowk in Kishanwadi has become a spot where garbage was being dumped continuously despite repeated reminders.

Due to requests by local residents of Kishanwadi, the issue was raised with the civic body by BJP member Bijal Vyas who is also the husband of a local corporator, Tejal Vyas.

Following Vyas’s repeated demands, the VMC on Tuesday promised him that the depression will be cleared and levelling work will be done in the area on Wednesday morning.

“Work was to begin at 10am and we reached the site, but nobody came. After much delay, when we contacted officials they suggested we should wait till tomorrow (Thursday),” said Bijal.

Peeved at the situation, Bijal contacted the top brass of the VMC demanding that the work should be taken up at the earliest.

“The area is filled with stench and even I had to cover my nose with a handkerchief. It is harmful for the health of the people,” said Vyas. After the row was sparked, the civic body rushed a team of workers to the spot and started cleaning work.

PUNE: Two more travellers, who recently returned from the novel coronavirus-hit China, were isolated at the civic-run Naidu Hospital on Wednesday after they complained of flu-like symptoms.With this, the number of individuals currently under the isolation facility in Pune has gone up to five. “Of these, two have tested negative for the novel coronavirus infection. The throat swab samples of the other three have been sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) and their reports are awaited,” Ramchandra Hankare, chief of the health department at Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said.Of the two newly isolated travellers, one is a 38-year-old businessman who had been to China on a business visit between January 15 and 21. Another person is a 33-year-old man who had been working in China for last eight months and came down to Pune on vacation on January 22.Three others from Pimpri Chinchwad, who travelled to China recently, have been under surveillance for 28 days. “These travellers are showing no symptoms and they have not been isolated.

200,['30/01/2020'],"UP government mulls plan to give annual boost of Rs 10,000 crore to MSMEs","This story is from January 30, 2020

Representative image

LUCKNOW: UP government is set to make it mandatory for all departments to allocate 25% of their budget expenditure for purchases from MSME units.

Once the proposal is cleared by competent authorities, it would be a boon of over Rs 10,000 crore annually for the state’s 7 lakh odd micro, small and medium scale enterprises ( MSMEs ).

A similar scheme was proposed last year but it could not make it to the Cabinet.

Another proposal, which will make it easier for MSMEs to recover their payments from both government departments and private purchases, is also expected to be considered.

Borrowing heavily from a similar policy by the Centre, UP’s scheme will make it mandatory for all government departments to allocate 25% of all purchases from MSMEs.

“We do not want a situation where a department is unable to spend its entire budget and use that as an excuse for not having made purchases from MSMEs. Therefore, 25% of their entire expenditure has to be from micro, small and medium units,” an official said.

According to the proposal, the MSMEs from which purchases will be made should be based in UP.

The Indian Industries Association (IIA), an umbrella body of MSMEs in the state, says that 90,000 units are registered in the state against the government’s claims of around 7 lakh units.

A certain percentage of the stipulated 25% will be reserved for MSMEs being operated by women while at least 5% will have to be procured from ‘green industries’.

Sources in the government said the environment department would have to certify industries as ‘green’ if they meet basic norms of pollution control. A list of such companies will be available with MSME department as soon as certification is completed.

Another advantage for MSMEs under the new policy will be preference in L1 bids if their quoted price is not more than 15% of the lowest bid.

“This means that if an MSME has quoted not more than 15% of the lowest bid, the MSME will be given an opportunity to match the price,” an official said.

NEW DELHI: After courting controversy with his provocative statement on Shaheen Bagh protests, West Delhi MP Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma released a video on Tuesday night, alleging that AAP government had enacted a law to provide monetary benefits to people belonging to a particular community.“Do you know that the chief minister made a law a year ago that is just for one community? CM said the government would give Rs 18,000 (up from Rs 10,000) and Rs 16,000 (up from 9,000) per month to imams and muezzins, respectively, of all mosques in the capital from its exchequer (sic),” Verma said. Despite repeated efforts, AAP didn’t respond to the comments.The video came hours after the chief electoral officer of Delhi took suo motu cognisance of Verma’s statements on Shaheen Bagh protests and submitted a report to Election Commission. EC on Wednesday issued a show cause notice to Verma and also asked BJP to remove him from the list of star campaigners.Delhi Waqf Board has been giving honorarium to imams and muezzins for decades. The board had only enhanced the amount paid as salary in January 2019. Of about 2,000 mosques in the capital, imams and muezzins of about 200 such establishments get salary from the board. Objecting to the monetary benefits given to them, Verma questioned why Delhi government was not giving similar remuneration to Hindu and Sikh priests.“The government forgot the priests of temples and granthis of gurdwaras. If our government comes to power, we will not discriminate against anyone. But CM says that salary will only be given to imams and muezzins,” Verma said.Verma asked why the government didn’t bring the proposal in the knowledge of the general public. “Did he bring this proposal before the public? He had promised that he would do all his work after taking the public into confidence. He is lavishly spending the hard-earned money of Delhi people on imams. You must think about it,” he said.Verma had earlier said that mosques and other such structures built on government land in his constituency would be razed if BJP came to power.

Aurangabad: The Kranti Chowk police have arrested a city-based hotelier and booked two others, including his kin, on the charges of attempting to murder a woman while asking her to withdraw the cases that she had reportedly registered against one of their close relatives in the recent past.

The accused has been identified as Rohit Rathod. He was produced before a court on Wednesday and remanded to four-day police custody.

Investigation officer and police sub-inspector Gajanan Sontakke said that a 28-year old woman, in her complaint, stated that she and her friend were taking a walk on Tuesday evening when the suspect duo approached them and asked her to withdraw the rape case registered against one of their relatives.

The complaint also stated that the duo allegedly attempted to strangulate the woman and attacked her with a sharp-edged weapon.

According to police, the woman has sustained stitches on her hand and injuries on neck and back.

The allegations have, however, been refuted a suspect who has been named in the case. He told TOI, “We have been framed in the case. We have CCTV footage evidence to substantiate our claim that at the time of incident, Rohit was at his home and I was at my home.” He also claimed that the police have refused to take cognizance of the CCTV footages and arrested Rohit without cross checking veracity of the allegations made in the complaint by the woman.

MUMBAI: The Uddhav Thackeray-led government has ordered an in-depth investigation into alleged financial and procedural irregularities found in the functioning of the Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Research Training and Human Development Institute ( Sarthi ) in Pune. The decision was taken at the state cabinet meeting on Wednesday.

Senior ministers said prima facie investigation into the irregularities called for an in-depth investigation and the government may also file an FIR once investigation is completed against officials who are found guilty. A preliminary investigation into the case was presented to the cabinet on Wednesday.

Sarthi was formed for research, policy advocacy and training for socio-economic and education development of Maratha, Maratha-Kunbi, Kunbi-Maratha and Kunbi communities and families dependent on agriculture. The company was formed by the BJP government led by Devendra Fadnavis.

“It has been found that Sarthi published advertisement to fill some 6,000 positions in the government by violating hiring norms. It has also hired employees from a firm (Bricks India) which is not on the government list,” said an official. He added the department spent huge sums on high-end cars for office bearers without securing government approval. Officials said approvals were not even sought for most buys. Relief and rehabilitation secretary Ramraje Nimbalkar was told to conduct a preliminary probe. Rajya Sabha MP Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje sat on a fast against the mismanagement.

PUNE: Private hospitals in Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad and Mumbai can now start isolation care services for travellers exhibiting flu-like symptoms in the wake of the novel coronavirus outbreak in China.

“The civic health departments of Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad and Mumbai have been directed to form expert committees of doctors working at government-run medical college. The committees will inspect private hospitals willing to start isolation care services for travellers before giving them a go-ahead,” director of the state health department Archana Patil , who issued a circular to this effect on Tuesday, said.

Currently, only civic-run Kasturba hospital in Mumbai and Naidu hospital in Pune are designated as isolation centres for travellers complaining of illness after returning from China and other affected countries.

Patil said norms have already been specified for private hospitals willing to start the service.

PMC health department chief Ramchandra Hankare said, “The objective here is to offer choice for isolation facility to the travellers exhibiting flu-like symptoms. While isolation care at civic- or state-run hospitals is free, those opting for the facility at private hospital will have to pay for it.”

The state health department has also directed state-run district hospitals and state-run medical colleges to keep the isolation facility ready.

Pune: A speeding dumper mowed down a 36-year-old woman from Lohegaon when she was crossing the Wagholi-Lohegaon road near Gatha Lawns on Tuesday morning.

The Airport police said Deepali Gaurav Mane was a resident of the Santnagar area. They have arrested the driver, Dhanaji Bhimrao Pawar (26) from Wagholi, for causing death due to negligence. Assistant inspector Zubair Mujawar said, “Mane, along with her father, used to run a stationery shop in the area. Around 8.45am on Tuesday, she reached the shop on her scooter and parked the vehicle on the other side of the road.”

“As she was crossing the road, the driver of the dumper lost control over the vehicle and it ran over her,” he said.

Though some passers-by shifted Mane to a nearby private hospital, doctors at the facility pronounced her dead on arrival. “Some people present at the accident spot stopped the dumper driver from fleeing the spot. A police team later took him into custody,” the officer said.

The advance autopsy report by the Sassoon General Hospital stated that Mane died of “multiple injuries.”

Mujawar quoted Pawar as saying during interrogation that the accident occurred when he had taken a turn towards Wagholi from Lohegaon road and lost control over the dumper. The officer said the driver claimed that he had not seen anybody crossing the road. “We have seized the dumper. It will be inspected by the Regional Transport Office, Pune,” Mujawar said.

“The driver was arrested on Tuesday night. The Khadki cantonment court on Wednesday remanded him in magisterial custody. He was later released on bail,” he added.

The police charged the dumper driver for committing offences under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Motor Vehicles Act on an FIR lodged by Mane’s father, Subhash Jadhav (67).

Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma

NEW DELHI: After courting controversy with his provocative statement on Shaheen Bagh protests, West Delhi MP Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma released a video on Tuesday night, alleging that AAP government had enacted a law to provide monetary benefits to people belonging to a particular community.

Complete coverage on Delhi elections

“Do you know that the chief minister made a law a year ago that is just for one community? CM said the government would give Rs 18,000 (up from Rs 10,000) and Rs 16,000 (up from 9,000) per month to imams and muezzins, respectively, of all mosques in the capital from its exchequer (sic),” Verma said. Despite repeated efforts, AAP didn’t respond to the comments.

The video came hours after the chief electoral officer of Delhi took suo motu cognisance of Verma’s statements on Shaheen Bagh protests and submitted a report to Election Commission. EC on Wednesday issued a show cause notice to Verma and also asked BJP to remove him from the list of star campaigners.

Delhi Waqf Board has been giving honorarium to imams and muezzins for decades. The board had only enhanced the amount paid as salary in January 2019. Of about 2,000 mosques in the capital, imams and muezzins of about 200 such establishments get salary from the board. Objecting to the monetary benefits given to them, Verma questioned why Delhi government was not giving similar remuneration to Hindu and Sikh priests.

“The government forgot the priests of temples and granthis of gurdwaras. If our government comes to power, we will not discriminate against anyone. But CM says that salary will only be given to imams and muezzins,” Verma said.

Verma asked why the government didn’t bring the proposal in the knowledge of the general public. “Did he bring this proposal before the public? He had promised that he would do all his work after taking the public into confidence. He is lavishly spending the hard-earned money of Delhi people on imams. You must think about it,” he said.

Verma had earlier said that mosques and other such structures built on government land in his constituency would be razed if BJP came to power. A list of such structures, he had said, had been sent to the LG.

PUNE: The Deccan Gymkhana police on Wednesday evening filed a non-cognizable offence against two students of a reputed college in the heart of the city on the charge of beating up a student earlier in the day.

According to police, the booked students were part of a meeting held to discuss NRC and CAA. The incident occurred when the complainant asked the students if they have taken permission of the college authorities to hold the meeting on the institute’s premises.

The question enraged the meeting attendees, following which two students got up and slapped the complainant. They also hurled abuses at him and issued threats, police said.

A few students rescued the complainant, following which he approached police.

VADODARA: Ten students from Gujarat returned home from China amidst the novel coronavirus scare there. All the students had gone to study medicine in Jiujiang University in Jiujiang.The outbreak in China has led to Indian students rushing back home. Several appeals were made by parents to the government asking it to ensure that the students returned home at the earliest.However, the present lot of students was able to return without much hiccups as they were staying about 250km away from Wuhan that is the worst affected due to the outbreak. They reached Ahmedabad in early on Wednesday and later reached their homes . So far, they have not shown symptoms of any illness.Said Kishansinh Gohil, one of the 10 students who stays in Godhra, “All of us came to Ahmedabad via Bangkok.

There was not much difficulty in reaching India and we could get tickets easily.”The group had boarded a flight from Nanchang airport in China. They were thoroughly examined before they left the country. “There is no lockdown in Jiujiang and hence we were able to leave easily. The authorities are being very careful to ensure that nobody who is sick with symptoms like that of the viral infection leaves the country,” said Om Upadhyay from Shehra, another student from Jiujiang who was among the 10 who returned on Wednesday.The group that returned on Wednesday includes four students from Godhra, one from Shehra, one from Lunawada, one from Anand and three from Mehsana.

NEW DELHI: Launching the last phase of its intensive campaign for the February 8 assembly elections on Wednesday, Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) has decided to conduct 8,000 small public meetings across Delhi. In the next six days, it will also organise 3,000 corner meetings and flash mob-like performances, and knock on the door of every Delhi household.

Complete coverage on Delhi elections

AAP has changed its campaign slogan from “Achhe beetay panch saal, lage raho Kejriwal” to “Achhe honge panch saal, Dilli mein toh Kejriwal”, which will be used extensively in the last phase. Earlier, AAP replaced its slogan, “Dilli mein toh Kejriwal”, with “Dilli bole dil se, Kejriwal phir se”. BJP had targeted the last slogan, claiming it was a lie as chief minister Arvind Kejriwal kept blaming the lieutenant governor for not letting him work for four and a half years of his government’s five-year term.

In the last phase, the AAP campaign, titled Mera Vote Kaam Ko, Seedhe Kejriwal Ko, focuses on reaching out to each and every voter of Delhi at least twice with a single message — vote for work, vote for the future of Delhi, vote for Kejriwal. It will project development as the most important issue in this election, a source said.

The door-to-door drive is AAP volunteers’ responsibility. The party has mobilised 21,000 volunteers — 300 per assembly constituency from its existing pool in Delhi — and 5,000 new faces, mostly students and young professionals who have been part of the Kejriwal Phir Se campaign.

All candidates, star campaigners and the entire AAP leadership in Delhi will participate in the public meetings at all levels. Around four public meetings have been planned every day in each of the 272 wards.

A plan has also been finalised to deploy around 3,000 volunteers at all prominent spots — markets, busy roads, public parks etc — across the 70 assembly constituencies every day to creatively communicate AAP’s message through street plays and flash mobs. “Each team will conduct 10 performances on average every day to remind Delhiites that their vote should be for the future of Delhi and for strengthening the hands of Kejriwal to work even more for them,” a party functionary said.

As part of the buzz campaign, AAP volunteers will distribute caps and pamphlets at all major traffic signals and metro stations. They will also interact with the public and encourage them to sport the white AAP cap.

Throughout this phase, the party will take care to send a clear and uniform message stressing the importance of re-electing Kejriwal as the chief minister for the future of Delhi, said a source. It will emphasise that if AAP returns to power, all free services will continue and more projects will be initiated for a better Delhi.

Bhushankumar Upadhye, Commissioner of Police during a talk on 'Reposing faith in police machinery' at Bar Room... Read More

Nagpur: It is important for an investigating officer not to leave loose ends while collecting evidence in criminal cases as it is a decisive factor in proving charges and ensuring conviction of perpetrators of the crime, said Bhushan Kumar Upadhyay, commissioner of police, on Wednesday.

He was delivering a lecture on ‘Challenges in investigation ’, organized by Study Circle of High Court Bar Association (HCBA). Vice-president of HCBA PB Patil, secretary PS Khubalkar and RD Bhuibhor were present.

Sharing his experience as an investigating officer, Upadhyay said the police personnel should be prompt in action once a complaint is lodged so that possible loopholes could be plugged and the case is taken to its logical conclusion.

He suggested that the system of doing panchnama should be upgraded and the procedure video-recorded by the investigating officer so that those involved in and witness to the crime would be exposed if they change their statements so vital in proving the charge. This, in turn, will increase the rate of conviction, he added.

Sharing an example, Upadhyay said discrepancies in investigation crop up if the police seize a sword from the spot used in the crime but the complainant says a hammer was used to attack. There are many such cases when what the complainants say differs from the circumstantial evidence which makes it difficult to prove charges, he said.

Investigating cyber crimes is a challenge. ATM-related cases can be tracked quickly, but those involving social media posts are difficult to prove as their offices are based out of the country, he said.

Despite facing many challenges, the police force is doing a good job. The judicial system of the country is held in high esteem which is a matter of pride, Upadhyay said.

DA Sonwane proposed a vote of thanks.

PUNE: The city police detained 315 people from different spots during the anti-CAA rallies in Pune on Wednesday.

The people detained from Deccan, Cantonment (Golibar Maidan), Swargate, Chandannagar, Wanowrie, Kondhwa and Samarth were released late in the evening. The action aimed at maintaining the law and order situation in the city against the backdrop of the bandh called by a few organisations, joint commissioner of police Ravindra Shisve said.

Barring a few pockets, there was lukewarm response to the strike against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens in the city. The protesters staged agitation at Sarasbaug, Swargate, near Golibar Maidan, Chandannagar and Yerawada. Many shops and eateries in Kondhwa were shut from the morning. Schools, colleges and public transport remained unaffected. Life returned to normal in the evening, police said.

Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham told TOI, “We detained at least 250 members of these organisations who had not taken permission from us. Overall, the bandh was observed peacefully across the city”.

The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) recorded a dip in the number of passengers travelling to different places from the city because of the Bharat Bandh. “I had planned to go to Mumbai for some work, but I dropped the plan after I heard about road blockades and protests,” said Rohan Bissar, a working professional.

A source said the average occupancy of the MSRTC buses was 50% on MSRTC. “The flow of passengers was thin, but our operations were not affected,” said Yamini Joshi, divisional controller, Pune, MSRTC.

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal turned emotional at a press conference on Thursday where he stated that despite being a serious diabetic, who takes insulin four times a day, he undertook fasts and made many sacrifices to serve the people of Delhi. Despite this, he was called a “terrorist” by BJP MP Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma In the evening, during his roadshow in northeast Delhi’s Babarpur, Kejriwal made an emotional appeal to people saying, “On February 8, if you consider me your son then vote for jhaadu (AAP’s symbol). And if you consider me a terrorist, then vote for kamal (BJP’s symbol). Delhiites will decide if they consider me their beta (son) or a terrorist.” The crowd responded with a resounding “beta”.Later, Kejriwal, along with AAP MP Sanjay Singh and party national secretary Pankaj Gupta lodged a complaint with Election Commission seeking an FIR against Verma and Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari. AAP also demanded imposing a complete ban on Verma and Tiwari from campaigning in the polls. In the complaint, AAP stated, “Manoj Tiwari supported the statement of Verma, thereby committing the same mistake.”On AAP’s complaint, the poll body sent a notice to Verma in the evening asking him to explain his position on the “terrorist” remark by 5pm on Friday.Talking to reporters, Kejriwal said, “In the last five years, I have considered every child my own by providing good education to them. I have arranged for better treatment and medicines to people. I sent the elderly on pilgrimage. I tried to take care of the families of martyrs. Does that make me a terrorist?”The CM said he could have left for another country after passing out of IIT-Kharagpur like his friends. However, he chose to serve the nation. “I quit as income tax commissioner to take part in the nation’s biggest movement against corruption. Are these the steps that a terrorist would take? My parents, who stay with me, were very disappointed with the statement. All they had to say was that their son is a patriot and not a terrorist,” Kejriwal said.During his roadshow, Kejriwal asked the same question to the gathering whether he was a terrorist as alleged by BJP. His queries were followed by a resounding “no” from the crowd. “Amit Shah roz Dilli aa rahe hain aur ulta sulta bol kar chale jaa rahein hain (Amit Shah is coming to Delhi every day and leaving after saying something adverse),” he said.Referring to BJP’s pre-poll alliance with JD(U) and Lok Janshakti Party and Congress’s tie-up with RJD, he said parties from different parts of the country are getting together to remove him from Delhi. “Amit Shah, Manoj Tiwari, Vijay Rupani, Manohar Lal Khattar have come here. Yogi Adityanath is also coming to Delhi. Bade bade dhurandhar aap ke bete ko harane aa rahe hain (A lot of bigwigs are coming here to defeat your son),” he told the crowd.Kejriwal said that cleaning the Yamuna would be a focus area for him in the next five years. “Before the next elections, I will take a dip in the Yamuna with all of you. There is a lot of pollution and the situation needs to be improved. Even transport needs to be spruced up by adding more buses. We have deployed marshals in buses.

Thus, we are dedicating our festival to him,” Mohol said while addressing a news conference.

Other festival honours have been lined up for veterans of Indian classical music Suhas Vyas and Vijay Ghate.

Exponents of classical music like Amjad Ali Khan, Taufiq Qureshi, Hariharan, Ashwini Bhide-Deshpande, and Sanjeev Abhyankar will perform at the festival. The section has been titled “Rasraj Samman”, in reference to what the late former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee called Pt Jasraj.

A highlight of the festival is a panel discussion featuring Pt Jasraj, Prabha Atre, Hariprasad Chaurasia, and Hridaynath Mangeshkar, about their musical journeys on February 2.

Brinda Karat

NEW DELHI: Senior CPM leader Brinda Karat on Wednesday petitioned Delhi police commissioner Amulya Patnaik to lodge an FIR against BJP MPs Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Verma for inciting communal enmity, hurling threats and making statements that are “prejudicial to national integration”.

Complete coverage on Delhi elections

The CPM petition to Patnaik said that while the Election Commission had taken note of the evidence against Thakur and Verma and removed them from the list of BJP’s star campaigners, it was “regrettable” that the Delhi Police, which took suo motu notice of statements made by other persons to file sedition cases against them, failed to act on the “blatantly communal and hate speeches” made by the two BJP MPs.

The Left party also sought FIRs against both MPs, immediately. “It is absolutely shocking that the Delhi Police failed to act in the face of blatantly communal and divisive public statements by one Union minister and another MP while campaigning for Delhi elections. Delhi police should file an FIR against them, failing which we will move court to demand action,” said the CPM politburo member.

Karat alleged that Verma “openly threatened” the women protesters of Shaheen Bagh by claiming the place would be cleared within an hour if BJP is elected to power in Delhi. “Verma seeks to characterise protesters at Shaheen Bagh as potential dangerous invaders into the homes of peaceful Hindus. It is inciting religious hatred by calling them rapists,” the complaint said.

LUCKNOW: Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University has directed all its 750 affiliated engineering and management colleges to furnish their coordinates on Google Maps.

The colleges are required to give details of the latitude and longitude of their location. The details have been sought by the government from AKTU .

The university will not declare examination results of the college which fails to furnish the information. Such a college also faces the risk of losing affiliation.

“The exact map location has been sought from colleges to check if a college indulges in foul play by claiming to have a campus to accommodate thousands of students. It will also help catch hold of colleges which claim to have two or more campuses and take affiliation for more courses,” said a senior AKTU official.

The colleges have to upload their details on the university’s dash board.

“As many as 185 colleges are still to update their information,” said AKTU spokesperson Asheesh Mishra.

Arvind Kejriwal with Raghav Chadha in Rajendra Nagar

NEW DELHI: From west Delhi’s Hari Nagar to Rajendra Nagar in New Delhi, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal took out four roadshows in as many constituencies on Wednesday.

Complete coverage on Delhi elections

In Hari Nagar, as the CM travelled in an open yellow jeep and alternated between waving to the crowd and flashing the victory sign, party supporters danced around his vehicle to the tune of “Lage Raho Kejriwal”, the theme song of AAP in the elections. Many held placards detailing the schemes launched by Delhi government in the last five years. The CM was accompanied by party candidate Rajkumari Dhillon. While some posed for selfies with Kejriwal — who chose not to speak during the roadshow — many showered flowers on them.

Several women supporters of Dhillon greeted her with folded hands and assured her of their vote. Reaffirming her support, Sangeeta Arora, a resident, said: “Nobody has worked for the city as much as this party has. Even if there are a few problems, we will still vote for AAP.” She added: “If a woman is elected, I am sure she will work to enhance our security.” Another resident said that while encroachments and potholed roads were annoyances, these issues paled in significance when compared with perks being offered in the form of free power and clean drinking water.

“The roads are broken and full of potholes. We have apprised Dhillonji of our concerns and I am sure she will work towards rectifying the situation if she wins. We have been told that the old sewer lines will be replaced soon,” Mamta Chhibbar, another resident opined.

The roadshow then headed to Rajendra Nagar where a huge number of supporters turned up on the streets. AAP has fielded young gun Raghav Chadha for this contest. Inder Kumar, a resident, had a word of caution for the party. “While we want AAP to win, we do hope that our area will get a little more attention than earlier,” he said.

Through the day, the CM also covered Shakur Basti where it has fielded Satyendar Jain and Moti Nagar (Shiv Charan Goel).

Rajkot: Western Railway (WR) has completed electrification of the newly converted broad gauge line between Mehsana and Vadnagar in just eight months.

On Wednesday, R K Sharma, commissioner of railway safety, conducted an inspection of the work at Vadnagar station.

According to a press release issued by the WR, the section between Mehsana and Vadnagar is part of the Mehsana-Taranga Hill gauge conversion project. The gauge conversion work of Mehsana-Vadnagar section of 34.43 km was completed and opened for rail traffic on July 23 last year.

The electrification of this section was sanctioned by Ministry of Railways in April last year at a cost of Rs 74.66 crore. The electrification work was taken by the WR on a war footing in May last year.

“Even though the Mehsana-Vadnagar section faced torrential rains during the monsoon season which held up the work for about three months, the WR was able to complete the work in a record time. The WR has certainly set a benchmark for other similar projects being executed by the WR to realize the nation’s ambitious mission of 100% electrification of railways,” said Ravinder Bhakar, chief public relations officer of the WR.

Gold medallists at the MS University convocation on Wednesday

Vadodara: As many as 25,000 higher education institutes in the country are bereft of accreditation as they are simply not ready to undergo the process from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC).

Now, UGC has launched a new scheme that is aimed to get all non-accredited institutes accredited by 2022.

“Through the new scheme Paramarsh we have asked best performing institutes of the country to act as mentors of those institutes which still do not have confidence to undergo accreditation process. We want that all the 40,000-odd institutes get accreditation by 2022,” UGC chairman professor Dhirendra Pal Singh said here on Wednesday.

NAAC is the autonomous body of the University Grants Commission (UGC) that assess and accreditates all higher education institutes.

He said that accreditation is not compulsory for some of the 25,000 non-accredited institutes as they are technical institutes while there are others who opt for accreditation from the National Board of Accreditation.

As the chief guest, Singh delivered the convocation address at the 68th annual convocation ceremony of M S University where a total of 12,042 students were conferred their degrees while 165 gold medallists bagged 280 gold medals.

During his convocation address, he said that there have been reports about unemployability of graduates coming out of higher educational institutions.

“Some of the lacunae pointed out by industry are soft skills such as effective communication, teamwork, discipline, professional and ethical practices among others,” he said.

Learning outcome-based curriculum framework has been adopted for revising curriculum of undergraduate programme.

TimesView Having an ineffective redressal system is as bad as not having one at all. Though the Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) is flooded with complaints on failure to provide basic civic services, including street lights and sanitation, what has been lacking is a time-bound redressal system with provisions of accountability. The long list of pending complaints continues to grow despite JMC staff working on weekends to resolve them. Some of the complaints as old as two months have not yet caught the attention of officials. The JMC needs to ensure disciplined handling of complaints, regularly monitored by a senior officer, and timely disposal of the same.

JAIPUR: Despite Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) officials worked on weekends to resolve complaints at the Sampark Samadhan portal, around 996 complaints are still pending. There are complaints that are pending for the last two months and most of them are against street lights, sanitation and encroachment.JMC commissioner V P Singh was not available to respond to the calls made by TOI. An official of JMC said that they are under pressure to resolve the complaints as soon as possible.“I agree that there might be complaints being filed everyday but why the complaints are pending after two months. We have asked all the officials to take the matter seriously and work efficiently,” said the official anonymously.Chief minister Ashok Gehlot last year took cognizance of the fact that thousands of complaints of various departments are pending. Officials in all departments suddenly came under pressure and started resolving complaints on time.Officials of JMC as well worked on weekend three weeks regularly to complete the pendency. After three months have passed, there is still lot pendency.An official of JMC said, “The issues pending also include some demands of the resident. Some people are demanding new sewage line or parking issues. These will be taken care off when tenders are issued. That will take some time.”Authorities are claiming to be working hard to resolve the issues, but still no deadline has been set till now. There is need to set the deadline so that there will be timely resolution of the complaints. Authorities at JMC said that there are many complaints that need time to be resolved which will be not possible if a deadline is set.Complaints are pending on various levels of the officers including sanitary inspector, zonal deputy commissioner, deputy commissioner health and CMO.",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73764605,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-144834,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/996-complaints-are-still-pending-at-jmc-portal/articleshow/73746308.cms

PUNE: A 29-year-old Undri resident fell for the lies of a glib-talking conman she had met on a matrimonial website in December last year and was duped of over Rs2.47 lakh on the promise of marriage.

With the help of an accomplice, the man used the trick of seeking money from her claiming that he was detained at the Mumbai airport by the customs. In two days — December 10 and 11 last year — the woman transferred over Rs2.47 lakh to free the man.

“The fraudster introduced himself to the woman as a UK-based businessman on a matrimonial website in the first week of December. After talking for a few days over social media websites and cellphone, he told her that he would come to India to finalize their wedding plans,” senior inspector of the Kondhwa police Vinayak Gaikwad said.

The complainant received a call from a woman posing as a customs official on December 10 and 11. “She told the complainant that her friend was arrested for possessing 10,000 US dollars. The woman, without checking the authenticity of the call, transferred over Rs2.47 lakh to multiple accounts provided by the fraudster,” he said.

The Kondhwa police booked the fraudsters on Wednesday under the relevant sections of the IPC and IT Act after the case was transferred from the cybercrime police station.

232,['30/01/2020'],NCDRC: Educational institutions out of Consumer Act purview,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Representative image

PUNE: The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), while answering a reference, has ruled that educational institutions, barring private coaching centres, are not covered under the provisions of the Consumer Protection (CP) Act, 1986.

“We are of the considered opinion that institutions rendering education including vocational courses and activities undertaken during the process of pre-admission as well as post-admission and also imparting excursion tours, picnics, extra co-curricular activities, swimming, sport, etc, except coaching institutions, will not be covered under the provisions of the CP Act, 1986,” the bench of NCDRC president RK Agrawal and members VK Jain and M Shreesha held on January 20.

The bench ruled, “Coaching centres cannot be equated to regular schools or colleges which are regulated by a regulatory authority and confer a degree/diploma on the student, who has passed in the examinations conducted as per the rules and norms specified in the statute and by the concerned universities. Therefore, strictly speaking, coaching centres cannot fall within the definition of educational institutions.”

The bench held that any defect or deficiency or unfair trade practice pertaining to a ‘service provider’ like coaching centres does fall within the purview of the CP Act, 1986.

Lawyer and education consultant Ravi Bharadwaj told TOI, “The NCDRC ruling means that now a student, who is victim of deficient service or unfair trade practice including admission in an unauthorized institution, will have to move either the civil court or the high court for remedy. This will be a huge discouragement considering the time taken in settlement of cases before conventional courts.”

Bharadwaj added, “A few years ago, an educational tribunal was conceived but nothing has happened on that front. The government needs to facilitate appointment of an Ombudsman or an Adjudicator at the university-level, whether public or private, where the student can raise grievances, otherwise the present NCDRC ruling seems to run in favour of educational institution rather than helpless students.”

“Interestingly,” he shared, “The National Commission , while answering the reference, has dealt with issues relating to core and non-core educational activities, which had remained untouched in the Supreme Court judgments so far. It has provided specific instances and answers on applicability of the CP Act in relation to such activities.”

A reference was made to the NCDRC for clarification in view of varied opinions before consumer forums and commissions over conflicting judgments by the Supreme Court (SC) on whether educational institutions are service providers and students are consumers. A number of consumer complaints, revision petitions and intervention pleas relating to the matter, including those by institutions from Maharashtra, were before the National Commission for reference.

In the PT Koshy case, the SC held in 2012 that students are not ‘consumers’ and education is not a commodity and educational institutions are not rendering a ‘service’. However, in the P Sreenivasulu case in 2015 the SC held that educational institutions would fall within the purview of the Consumer Protection Act and that education is a service.

In another judgment in 2017 in the Anupama College of Engineering case, the SC reaffirmed the position laid down by the PT Koshy judgment. In doing so, it relied on a 2010 judgment in the Maharshi Dayanand University case, which examined in detail the jurisdiction of the consumer forums to entertain a complaint relating to educational institutions.

NEW DELHI: Calling the Delhi assembly elections a battle of ideologies, Union home minister Amit Shah said on Thursday that two forces were standing face to face and people would have to decide which ideology wins.“On one side, there is Prime Minister Narendra Modi who carried out air and surgical strikes to finish terrorists in their home by entering Pakistan. On the opposite side are people who support Shaheen Bagh,” the former BJP president claimed at a public meeting at Bhati Mines’ Sanjay Colony on the outskirts of Delhi.“Sanjay colony residents, are you their vote banks? Who is their real vote bank?” Shah asked the crowd, who chanted back “Shaheen Bagh”. A large number of refugee families who have arrived from Pakistan live in the colony.Shah said voting for BJP would not only remove the Kejriwal government but also defeat an idea. “The idea that protects Bharat Mata will be made victorious,” he added, urging people to forcefully press the EVM button on February 8 so that the current could be felt in Shaheen Bagh.“Arvind Kejriwal is asking why Modiji is giving citizenship to Pakistanis. These Hindus, Sikhs, Jains are persecuted people who lost their homes, their land; the women of whose family were tormented. They also have as much right on India as we do,” he added.Shah said when the Centre had brought the Citizenship Amendment Bill, people were instigated and riots happened in Delhi. “(AAP’s) Manish Sisodia says they are with Shaheen Bagh. Manish bhai, if you are with Shaheen Bagh, we are with Sanjay Colony,” the minister said.At RK Puram in the evening, Shah said voting for BJP would ensure security of Delhi and India. “It is now an election between two ideologies,” he reiterated, adding that Shaheen Bagh was not a place or an incident, but an ideology.Shah slammed AAP’s Delhi government for not giving permission for charge-sheeting the people who allegedly raised the slogan, “Bharat tere tukde honge, ek hazar ek hazar”, in JNU two years ago. “Have you not seen Sharjeel Imam’s video? We have caught him and he is now in jail. Kejriwal should tell whether he will save him too? Delhiites want to know before February 8,” he said.Pointing out that he had already covered 34 assembly constituencies, Shah said “only one more is required to get the majority”. A party or coalition needs to get 36 seats to form government in Delhi.Calling Kejriwal “the country’s liar number one”, Shah attacked the AAP government for its failure in multiple areas like water quality, 500 new schools, free Wi-fi and the Yamuna pollution. “When I ask question, Kejriwal says we are disrespecting Delhi. Indira Gandhi used to say Indira is India and India is India. Does Kejriwal think he is Delhi? We will keep questioning his lies,” he alleged. AAP didn’t comment on any of the allegations.While crediting the Modi government for the air strikes on Pakistan, the minister said, “Any Alia-Malia-Jamalia used to enter our country from Pakistan and chop off the heads of our soldiers... But these people oppose the strikes due to their vote-bank politics.”Shah claimed that the parties that supported Shaheen Bagh “cannot protect Delhi, can’t make India proud, and can’t ensure better lives for the crores of poor. These works can only be done by Modiji and BJP”.",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73792682,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-983607,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi/battle-between-indias-protectors-and-shaheen-bagh-backers-shah/articleshow/73781845.cms

HYDERABAD: The murder mystery of former minister Vivekananda Reddy has further deepened following objections raised by his daughter Sunitha Narreddy. Recently, Kadapa police had approached Pulivendula court asking for narco analysis test on three more persons including one Parameswara Reddy .

“Earlier narco was conducted on a few suspects. We asked for narco test on three suspects and they denied in writing. Now, our petition seeking narco test is pending before the Pulivendula court,” a top Andhra Pradesh police officer said.

Vivekananda Reddy was murdered at his house on March 15, 2019. Since then, three SITs were formed, and several petitions were filed in the high court seeking a CBI investigation.

Police said 67 witnesses were examined in the past two months by the special investigation t eam. Police were also investigating as to who had asked the people at the scene of the offence to hide the letter which was said to have been written by Vivekananda Reddy under duress.

In a PIL filed in the AP high court, Sunitha Narreddy raised several questions. “Role of Ranganna alias Rangaiah the night watchman has to be investigated. If the watchman is sleeping outside, how the culprits got access to enter the house? Why was the cause of death projected as cardiac arrest till the photos and video came to our knowledge?” she asked.

“Though it is a clear case of murder, why case was booked under 174 CrPC and who is behind this? Yerra Gangi Reddy was insisting not to register the case and hush up everything,” she questioned.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday said the Modi government got JNU scholar Sharjeel Imam arrested for making seditious statements and now the Arvind Kejriwal government should take action against people who shout slogans to “divide India”.

Complete coverage on Delhi elections

Addressing a nukkad sabha for BJP Bijwasan assembly constituency candidate Sat Prakash Rana at Mahipalpur on Wednesday, Shah said, “The central government got Sharjeel Imam arrested. You (Kejriwal) had dared and tweeted to arrest him as I’m the home minister. We have arrested him. Now you tell me. When the time to file the chargesheet comes, will you give permission? Tell the people of Delhi, or it will be like what happened with Kanhaiya Kumar and Umar Khalid.”

“Abuse us, no problem. Abuse the Modi government, no problem. But if you speak about doing tukde-tukde of Bharat Mata, then your place will be behind the bars,” Shah said.

Talking about CAA, the BJP star campaigner said that no one in the country had anything to fear. “So much rioting happened in Delhi. Buses were burnt. Minorities were instigated with misinformation. I want to make it clear, no one’s citizenship will go,” he added.

Taking a dig at Kejriwal’s promise of Europe-like roads in Delhi, Shah said he couldn’t figure out if there were potholes in the roads or roads in potholes. He also blamed Kejriwal for the spike in pollution levels. “If someone is responsible for the high pollution levels, then it is the Kejriwal government. The Delhi air has been poisoned,” he said at a rally in Najafgarh.

The Union minister appealed to people to have the same party, BJP, at the Centre, state and corporation levels. “It’s like a combination lock with three numbers. If they are the same, then only the bag of vikas will open,” said Shah at another nukkad sabha at Jorbagh.

Shah stressed on various issues, including abrogation of Section 370, Uri surgical strikes, central health schemes, regularisation of unauthorised colonies, among others. Amid loud cheers from the crowd, he said, “I want to make a promise today. Within four months, we will build a skyrocketing mandir at the same place where Lord Ram was born.”

File photograph of Prithvi Raj Nagar

JAIPUR: The Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) increased the regularisation and development charges for Prithvi Raj Nagar (PRN) Scheme. The order was released by the civic body on Wednesday.

With this fresh order, plot owners who have not procured the lease deeds till date would face a jolt as they will have to pay higher rates.

As per the orders, the JDA has set a target to issue lease deeds to all the PRN plot holders till November 2020. Residents, who will fail to procure lease deeds in the given time, will have to pay double development and regularisation rates to regularise their plots.

A deadline of June 31, 2020 has also been set for the colonies in the PRN scheme which have already been regularised but the plot owners have not procured the lease deeds.

For a 100 square yard plot, the JDA will now charge Rs 300 regularisation charge (per square yard), which will include allotment rates. Similarly, for plot size between 101 to 300 square yard, the JDA would charge Rs 480 regularisation charge (per square yard) including allotment rates.

The JDA would charge regularisation rates of Rs 720 (per square yard) for plots bigger than 301 square yard and up to 1,000 square yard.

Owners having a plot more than 1000 square yard will have to give 1.5 times regularisation charges. For regularising the marriage garden in the scheme which are developed on the plot size above 2,000 square yard, the JDA has fixed Rs 1,500 (per square yard) regularisation charge.

The development charge for all of the residential plots will be Rs 660 irrespective of the plot size. An official said, the JDA will also regularise colonies which were developed after 1999 by the farmers. However, the plots of the colony should be sold till 2012. Moreover, plots that are being used for commercial and institutional purpose will be regularised at the new rate fixed by the JDA.

Schemes, which have some portion in PRN, while remaining part out of PRN will also be regularised. All the plots of such colonies will be regularised at the prescribed rate of PRN.

Bengaluru: The state government has given sanction to the Central Bureau of Investigation to investigate two senior IPS officers – Hemanth Nimbalkar and Ajay Hilori – in connection with the Rs 4 ,000-crore IMA scam. Cases will be booked against them under the Prevention of Corruption Act.

This is the first time in recent years that the government has given green signal to prosecute IPS officers for alleged complicity in a crime. Usually, the bureaucratic lobby prevails upon the political leadership to delay or deny sanction for prosecution.

The government circular issued on Wednesday reads, “CBI investigation disclosed there was concerted effort on the part of various police officials to protect the interest of Mohammed Mansoor Khan, managing director and chief executive officer of I Monetary Advisory. Instead of protecting the interest of investors and depositors, they submitted improper inquiry reports and recommended no action against IMA, and as a quid pro quo, received bribes/valuable things from IMA. Investigation also disclosed that evidence collected so far prima facie shows these public servants allegedly committed offences under sections 7 and 11 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (as amended in 2018).”

Earlier, a CBI release said, “Public servants have blatantly and dishonestly favoured IMA group and allowed them to continue their activities unhindered. They failed to take timely action despite being directed to conduct an inquiry/investigation. RBI repeatedly wrote to these authorities through the state chief secretary and DGP, requesting for urgent and suitable action.”

Udhagamandalam: In a first in the state , the Coonoor municipality has done away with the use of ballpoint in the office to reduce use of single-use plastic.

Instead, officials and workers in the office started to use fountain pens since Monday.

During his speech after unveiling the tricolor on Republic Day, Coonoor municipal commissioner K Balu stressed the need for reducing plastic trash, especially one-time use, at source.

Taking a cue from the speech, the Coonoor municipal workers’ association took a decision to avoid usage of ballpoint pens in the office and instead use fountain pens.

Speaking to TOI, Balu said, “It is a good initiative taken by the workers to avoid using ballpoint pens in the office. Since Monday, the initiative is being implemented in the office.”

He said, “Gradually, the initiative would be introduced in municipal schools in Coonoor. It is nothing but going back to the old method of environment-friendly.”

The Coonoor municipality collects 10-11 metric tonnes of garbage daily, of which around 1 tonne is recyclable plastic.

“During tourist season time, the amount of garbage collection would increase. A bio-mining plant is coming up in the dump yard to compost wet wastes,” the official said.

‘Clean Coonoor’ initiative has been rendering a helping hand to the Coonoor municipality in segregation of garbage and creating anti-plastic awareness among the public.

Dr Vasanthan, a representative of ‘Clean Coonoor’ initiative said, “Everything starts from home. Thus, the Coonoor municipality has set an example in minimizing plastic trash, though in a small way.”

AHMEDABAD: The state mid-day meal commissioner issued a circular to the director of primary education, directing him to ensure no untouchability or discrimination is practised at mid-day meals in schools.

The circular issued on January 2, 2020, which leaked on Wednesday, says that the government wants that all students, irrespective of caste, take eat their tasty and healthy mid-day meal together without practising any caste-based discrimination.

“It has been instructed to take precautions and ensure that students are made to sit in one queue according to their roll numbers. Their water pots will not be different and no discrimination or untouchability on basis of caste will be tolerated,” states the circular issued by the joint commissioner of the mid-day meal scheme , MK Pandya.

The circular was sent to district primary education officers, deputy collectors and director of the scheduled caste welfare department of the state.

“A resolution passed at a Dalit meeting recently, drew the government’s attention to the fact that caste-based discrimination is practised at some schools where students are made to sit in separate lines and their water pots are also separate,” it adds.

The circular states that if any such practice comes to the government’s notice, the headmaster of the school will be held responsible and disciplinary action will be taken against him or her.

About the circular, Pandya first said he was not aware of any such circular. He later told TOI, “It was a letter sent to the authorities to ensure that no untouchability is practised.”

“Though, we did not receive a single complaint about discrimination, it was discussed at a Dalit community event. I had sent the letter to ensure that no caste-based discrimination takes place,” he said.

BENGALURU: People with travel history to China, who self-reported themselves at Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD) to ensure they haven’t contracted coronavirus , now don’t want to stay in the hospital. Reason: there are just four toilets for all patients in the isolation ward and those admitted fear getting infected.Relatives of these patients say the four washrooms are open for all, which is a cause for concern. Most of them have visited the government hospital for the first time and are now asking doctors if they could be shifted to private facilities or allowed to go home.“My wife is absolutely fine. Because she had travelled to China, we wanted to rule out the possibility of an infection. She is uncomfortable here and we want to shift her,” the spouse of a patient told TOI.Since last week, 10 patients with travel history to China got themselves admitted at the special isolation ward set up at RGICD. Of these, test reports of three persons have come negative and two of them have been discharged.“One of the patients whose report came negative was asked to stay here for another day. But he chose to leave the hospital on seeing other self-reported cases and due to lack of basic infrastructure here,” said a patient’s relative. Hospital authorities, however, claim the man was discharged after due procedures.The admission of a woman on Tuesday night got other patients worried. “She doesn’t seem to be from India. She could be Tibetan or Chinese. We don’t have anything against her. But if she is infected, the rest of them in the ward shouldn’t be affected,” said the relative of another patient.Patients’ attendants wrote a letter to the hospital director on Tuesday night stating they either be provided with better toilet facilities and private wards or shifted to private hospitals A patient’s relative told TOI that in no way did the facility meet the requirements of an isolation ward. “The gap between two beds is barely one meter and there is just a thin curtain separating the two. There are chances of infection spreading from one patient to another,” the person added. The primary concern is that even if one patient is infected, he/she could spread the virus to others in the ward.“Nurses have protective gear. But patients are only given a mask. My brother is worried that he may get infected here and not from his China travel,” said a relative.Hospital authorities, meanwhile, seem to be disappointed with the way patients and their relatives are reacting. “We provide food from the hospital and dinner is served at 7.30pm. But one patient demanded food from outside late at night and we still obliged. That’s too much to expect. Some of the patients now want to be shifted to private hospitals,” said Dr C Nagaraja, director, RGICD.Even for patients whose sputum and blood sample results have come negative, the health department has suggested that they be kept in the hospital for another day. But most of the patients don’t seem to be keen on this.RGICD authorities said patients’ concerns have been communicated to the state health and family welfare department (surveillance wing).",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73752518,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-255160,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/shift-us-to-private-hosps-or-let-us-go-home-say-patients/articleshow/73745840.cms

On reaching the office, Dewan was handed over a box when he asked for a parcel in the name of one Sameer. On receiving the parcel, the narcotics intelligence sleuths introduced themselves to Dewan and opened the box. After uncovering many packages, five packets were found in which marijuana weighing 3.1 kilograms was found. Dewan was arrested and interrogated wherein he admitted that the co-accused Saiyed had asked him to take the delivery of the parcel for a payment of Rs 5,000.

BENGALURU: Conductor-less buses are likely to make a comeback in the city soon with BMTC planning to induct 90 such buses on Metro feeder routes .

Non-AC midi electric buses with a passenger capacity of 30 to 35 will be deployed to and from Metro stations like Mysuru Road, Byappanahalli, Banashankari and Indiranagar.

Sources said the buses will have a smartcard-based automatic fare collection system where passengers will need to swipe their smartcards. These buses are being launched under Bengaluru Smart City funds. Though BMTC scrapped its earlier Axis Bank open-loop card, the Centre’s National Common Mobility Card will work in these buses.

BMTC managing director C Shikha said, “The conductor-less buses will have flat fare structure. We will adopt tap technology for fare collection. The AFCS will be designed to be compatible with the NCMC card.”

Bengaluru Smart City Limited will fund Rs 50 lakh per bus and Rs 5 crore for charging infrastructure. The remaining amount will be borne by BMTC. Shikha said boards of both BSCL and BMTC have approved the project. “We will soon float tenders and buses will roll out in nine months,” she said.

In late 1990s, BMTC introduced Pushpak buses (Janapriya Vahini services) that did not have conductors. The service was scrapped after some buses met with accidents since drivers were busy issuing tickets even while negotiating congested roads.

Sources said BMTC is likely to provide incentives to passengers with smartcards and a flat rate will be charged for those without cards. “Metro users can use their Metro smartcard or integrated ticket/token to travel in these feeder buses,” said an official.

BMTC operates 154 buses in 38 Metro feeder routes, an average of 18km. BMTC is spending nearly 55 % of revenue on operational costs mainly for salaries of employees. A BMTC source said, “Twenty eight of the 38 feeder routes are served by less than five buses per route, indicating the need for service augmentation. The proposed feeder bus services will be available within five minutes of waiting time. The smart buses will be deployed on nine routes and 56 schedules with an average route length of 9km. Each route will have six buses and an average waiting time of five minutes.”

In Mumbai, Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport recently introduced bus services without conductors. Passengers need to buy tickets at the originating stop while boarding these non-stop buses. Conductor-less buses are popular in cities like Paris, London, Los Angeles, Helsinki, Shanghai, Istanbul, and Moscow.

According to him, the animal was found lying on its back. “Its teeth and nails were intact.”

Postmortem was conducted at the spot as per the guidelines of National Tiger Conservation Authority, he said. As the carcass was slightly decomposed, external injuries could not be identified. TNN

Police officials arrived at the spot and managed to disperse a crowd of 200 people

LUCKNOW: Police responded swiftly to an alert received on UP112 and foiled an attempt to start another agitation against the new citizenship law near Mohanlalganj railway station in Lucknow district on Wednesday evening.

Senior police officials and Mohanlalganj police rushed to the spot and managed to disperse a crowd of approximately 200 people by warning them of action and detained 10 persons.

Those detained are Shailendra Gautam, Bablu Ambedkar, Raju Rawat, Sanjay Rawat, Amarjeet, Raghvendra, Jai Prakash, Raj Narayan, Brinda Prasad and Dileep Kumar.

They have been detained for violation of section 144 CrPC which forbids assembly of four or more persons at a public place. Locals said that all those detained were workers of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) but senior police officials told TOI that they had not yet investigated or verified their affiliation to any social or political outfit.

As a precautionary measure, heavy police force was deployed near the railway station to prohibit any further attempt of starting protest.

Earlier, police rushed to the Mohanlalganj railway station on receiving an information on UP112 that as many as 200 people holding placards with anti-CAA slogans, photographs of Dalit icon BR Ambedkar, and and flags of Bhim Army and BSP were going to stage a protest.

Deputy commissioner of police (south zone) Pooja Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (Mohanlalganj), and SHO Mohanlalganj reached the spot.

DCP (south zone) Pooja Yadav told TOI, “The people going to stage the protest were told that section 144 was clamped in the commissionerate and it was illegal to hold any protest and hence action would be taken against them. Most protesters agreed and walked away while 10 continued protest and were detained.”

Meanwhile, in Kakori police station area, workers of several groups and organisations took out a march from Andhe Ki Chowki police outpost to Dubagga outpost holding placards and slogans against the Citizenship Amendment Act but ended their protest without the need for any police intervention.

Protests against the law are still continuing at the Clock Tower in Husainabad area of Chowk and at Ujariyaon in Gomtinagar, in Lucknow police commissionerate.

HYDERABAD: A day after an 80-year-old woman was murdered and her ornaments stolen, Kandukur police arrested a security guard residing near her house and recovered six tola gold, 10 tola silver and a mobile phone from him.

JAIPUR: Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) was supposed to increase the number of garbage collection vehicles in the city, however, that plan is yet to be executed. At present, there are 580 vehicles in the city, although that number was 700 in the past.

In Swachhta Surveskshan ranking, door-to-door garbage collection contain good weightage but due to low number of vehicles residents of the city are suffering from the irregular frequency of the vehicles.

Jamna Sharma, a resident of Vaishali Nagar said that hoopers are coming once in three days and we have complained many times but no one is paying any heed. “Once in three days, hoopers are coming and we have asked the reason, the drivers told us that there are not enough vehicles for the regular visit. We have to collect the garbage in our home and wait for the vehicles to arrive,” said Jamna.

Zakir Khan of Kho Nagoriyan in Jaipur said that in their area twice in a week garbage vehicles are coming. “Our area is already outskirts of the city and officials do not worry. Earlier there used to be just once a week visit by the hoopers but now at least they are visiting twice. That is an advantage for us,” said Khan.

Health DC at JMC Harshit Verma wasn’t available for comment.

JMC Commissioner V P Singh took meeting of the officials a few weeks away and claimed that they will purchase more vehicles but this hasn’t been implemented. Reason for the decrease in the hoopers is seemed to be the payment issued between JMC and BVG company responsible for garbage collection.

Manager of the BVG company Rajesh Chaudhary said that there has been some discussion about the clearance of the payment of Rs 130 crore but it will take some time.

Another issue in the walled city is the garbage dumps all over the walled city area. Residents say that when the Swacchta Survekshan was going on there was cleaning in the area but now slowly things are moving towards the old norms.

Senior Congress leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Congress on Wednesday demanded a nationwide farm loan waiver even as it accused the Modi government of “hatching a conspiracy” to end the minimum support price system, a move it alleged would leave farmers at the mercy of the open market.

In continuation of its pre-budget press conference series to “expose” the Modi government on the downward slide of the economy, Congress quoted a Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) report, to allege that the government was considering stopping the purchase of crops from farmers.

“Until now, the BJP government has cheated and exploited the farmers in the Budget. We hope that in this year’s budget, the finance minister will clarify to the people of the country what it has done to double farmers’ income by 2022, the status of finances of the Food Corporation of India as well as of the Agriculture Market Infrastructure Fund,” said Prithviraj Chavan , former Maharashtra CM Prithviraj Chavan, adding that the CACP report recommended a reduction in the purchase of wheat and paddy from farmers.

Congress alleged that in 2018-19, the Agri-Market Infrastructure Fund received an endowment of Rs 2,000 crore but spent only 0.5% of the amount. The proposal was to set-up 22,000 markets but only 376 were set up, Chavan said, adding that while the government had claimed it would double farmers' incomes by 2022, it is not considering stopping MSP and subsidy money to the Food Corporation of India, which had debts exceeding Rs 2.65 lakh crore.

Congress also demanded that the government bring agriculture produce, implements as well as processed farm goods under the minimum GST rate to protect an already stressed farm sector.

On Wednesday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also slammed the Modi government for “turning around” the Indian economy, literally. In a Twitter post, Rahul took a jibe at the Modi government and said the while inflation levels has climbed to where the GDP rates were, the GDP had plunged to historic lows. “Modi & his dream team of economic advisers have literally turned the economy around. Earlier: GDP: 7.5% Inflation: 3.5% Now: GDP: 3.5% Inflation: 7.5% The PM & FM have absolutely no idea what to do next,” Rahul said on Twitter.

AHMEDABAD: Cyber cell of the city police on Tuesday arrested a mechanical engineering student, Ankit Solanki , 20, a resident of Patan , for making fake Instagram accounts of two girls , and posting lewd messages on the social media platform.

According to the cyber cell, in August 2019, the two girls approached them with an application of complaint stating that some unknown persons had made around eighteen fake IDs bearing their profile photos and are sending lewd and abusive messages from them.

DCP cyber cell Rajdeepsinh Jhala said investigators approached internet service providers to get the IP log of the device from which the fake IDs were made.

“Based on the IP address, which was from Patan, we sent a team to Patan and found that the IDs were created on a device belonging to Ankit Solanki. Solanki is in the fourth semester of his mechanical engineering course at Gujarat Power Engineering College,” added Jhala.

During the interrogation of the accused, it emerged that Solanki and one of the girls met on Instagram about a year ago. “They got close and began talking on the phone. Ankit objected to her interacting with other boys through the Instagram account, and asked her to remove them. This led to a fight and they stopped talking,” said a cyber cell source, adding that he then created the fake Instagram accounts and posted lewd messages on them to get even with her.

COIMBATORE: Ahead of the Union budget to be tabled on Saturday (February 1), micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the district said they wanted the Centre to help facilitate them easy loans, while stimulating industrial growth and bringing the sector out of the present slump.

Pointing out that banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) were apprehensive about sanctioning them loans, they said the sector should be provided loans through friendly processes and at a reduced interest rate.

R Ramamurthy, president, Coimbatore District Small Industries’ Association (Codissia), said while the interest rate for them was around 9%-9.5%, it should be brought down to below 7% or should be on par with that for agriculture sector. “NBFCs are charging an interest of 15%-17%, which is too high. This also should be brought down. It would be enough if the difference in interest is around 2%-3% form that of banks,” he said.

J James, president, Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Micro Enterprises, said they wanted the interest rate on bank loans to be fixed at 5%, as several micro units were pushed to the verge of closure due to economic slowdown. “For the defaulters, penalty should be waived off and the deadline for repaying them should also be extended.” He said there has to be new policies to introduce schemes to develop industrial parks and startups.

Another demand that representatives of Coimbatore Tirupur District Micro and Cottage Entrepreneurs’ Association (Cotma) put forth was to increase the working capital loans to 40% of the firm’s turnover from 20%. They have shot off a letter to prime minister Narendra Modi in this regard. Ramamurthy said only if they were given a working capital loan of 40%, they would be able to meet the fund requirement to stay in the market and take care of GST payments. They also wanted subsidiaries on machineries to be increased to 25% from 15%.

Presently, the debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) parameters, based on which banks assess the ability of a firm to repay debts, are the same for both big corporates and MSMEs. “This should be changed. DSCR should be flexible and suit MSMEs. A feasibility study of MSMEs should be carried out and fix DSCR accordingly.”

Industrialists said the Centre should also stimulate the economic situation by creating demand for industries. “For this, the Centre should quicken the infrastructure projects worth ‘102 lakh crore’ that it had promised. This would spur activities at all levels of industrial sector and help us tide over the slump,” Ramamurthy said.

COIMBATORE: More than 400 cadres of DMK on Wednesday staged a protest in the city against the corporation for constructing micro-composting centres in residential areas and handing over the 24X7 water supply project to a French company.

The cadres were detained at south taluk office as they staged protest without police permission.

Singanallur DMK MLA N Karthik led the protest.

Speaking to reporters, Karthik said the 24X7 water project should be implemented either by the corporation or by the Tamil Nadu Water and Drainage Board.

On corporation’s move to decentralize solid waste by constructing micro-composting centres across the city, he said such centres should be constructed on isolated places and not in residential areas.

At present, the corporation has been constructing the centres at playgrounds, parks and other public places that are surrounded by residential areas despite opposition from the public, he said. The move would not just create inconvenience to the public but also cause health hazards, he said.

Despite DMK and its allies vehemently opposing both the projects, the corporation has been carrying out its work, the MLA added.

Thrissur: The forest department had issued an order to register the details of elephants that would be paraded at temple festivals in each district.

The details of the temple and details of parading elephants must be submitted online before February 20, said the order. “In Thrissur, elephants were used for parades in over 1,200 temple festivals. But the officials have registered only 722 temple festivals. The temple, church and Mosque authorities must register the details of the festival and number of parading elephants before the date,” said the order by Thrissur Social forestry ACF P M Prabhu.

“The festivals which used elephants for parades before 2012 should register to the forest department website. As part of submitting the register, the temple officials should register the name of the temple, GPS reading, number of using elephants for parades, date and other details” said the order.

Thrissur assistant forest conservator (ACF) P M Prabhu said, “When festivals are registered online the forest department can realize the details of the temple festivals, number of elephants to be used and the festival conducting area. The details should help the forest department to monitor the elephant parade conducting festivals in the district”

“The new initiative also helps in preventing the use of the injured elephants in parades.” said the official.

As per the Supreme Court direction, the elephant parade details were to be registered in 2015. But many temples failed to register their details in 2015. The new order aims to provide a chance to all temples to register the details on the forest department website, said the official.

Last week Thrissur ACF sent a letter to district collector and chief wildlife warden requesting to prevent the use of injured elephants in the temple festivals.

261,['30/01/2020'],New Araku district may come at the cost of a smaller Vizag,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Visakhapatnam: At a time when the state government is mulling the formation of smaller districts, a proposal to convert Araku Lok Sabha constituency into a separate district has turned out to be a cause of concern for many, especially plain dwellers in the constituency.

The constituency comprises seven assembly segments, of which six are reserved for scheduled tribes (STs) and one for scheduled castes (SCs), making it difficult for most SCs, backward classes (BCs), other backward classes (OBCs) and other castes (OCs) to field a candidate of their choice in six of the segments. The constituency is spread over four districts, stretching from the Vamsadhara river in Srikakulam district to the Godavari river in East Godavari district.

Overall tribal population in the constituency is almost 55 per cent, with SCs and plain communities comprising the rest. The assembly segments of Rampachodavaram in East Godavari, and Araku and Paderu in Visakhapatnam district house a majority of the tribal population but tribal population exceeds 40 per cent in only Kurupam assembly segment . In Salur, Parvathipuram and Palakonda segments, the tribal population is less than 30 per cent.

The separate district proposal, however, has raised eyebrows among certain sections. Former Araku MP and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader Kishore Chandra Deo said, “First, there is the problem of travelling from one end of the constituency to the other. It stretches from the Vamsadhara in Palakonda to the Godavari in East Godavari district, through hilly terrain affected by insurgency, making it a difficult task for any collector to administer.”

On the socioeconomic implications of the proposal, the former MP said there would be ramifications for the farmers and non-tribals in Kurupam, Salur, Parvathipuram and Palakonda assembly segments, who form a majority. A recent proposal by the Tribal Advisory Committee to declare almost a 1,000 villages in these four segments under Vizag Agency was opposed by the YSR Congress. P Madhava, a general secretary of the BC wings of the YSRC said, “This move will have severe socioeconomic repercussions. There will be a lot of strife between STs and non-STs, there will not be any investment and economic activity and backwardness will become the bane of this district if it is formed.”

A senior advocate from Vizianagaram, PK Bannerjee, instead proposed turning Parvathipuram revenue division into a separate district, with the inclusion of areas from Srikakulam district, such as Palakonda. He added, “This would make a small, compact district, which would be easy to administer and would comprise major trading towns such as Parvathipuram, Bobbili, Palakonda and Salur.”

Lucknow Municipal Corporation

LUCKNOW: Lucknow Municipal Corporation has suffered a loss of Rs 1 crore as it has not received rental charge from 25,000 owners of housing units in Gomtinagar who have rented their house for last six years.

The fact was revealed after LMC conducted a survey in Gomtinagar. Now, the civic body is planning to conduct drives in remaining seven zones of the city to identify other such defaulters.

According to LMC rulebook (clause 21), owner of every household under civic body jurisdiction who has rented his house will have to pay additional 25% in property tax.

For example, if a landlord is paying Rs 5,000 to LMC as property tax every year, he will have to pay extra Rs 1,250 as rental charge.

In the survey of zone-4 (Gomtinagar), LMC identified at least 25,000 housing units in the area which were not paying rental clause amount for last six years.

House tax is the main source of revenue for the civic body.

As per records, nearly 70% of total housing tax collected by LMC is used for works like construction or repair of roads, installation of streetlights and development of parks. The remaining amount goes towards payment of salaries to LMC employees.

“The laxity is on the part of tax collection officers. We will conduct similar drives in all seven zones of the city and recover rental amount before the next financial year,” said Kuldeep Awasthi, tax superintendent, LMC.

Statue of Unity

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday advised the petitioner to negotiate with the government over the grievance that the administration is seeking to evict six villages for tourism-related projects near the Statue of Unity in Narmada district .

Environment activist Mahesh Pandya has filed a PIL objecting to the government authorities’ bid to evict people from six villages. The government has proposed a compensation package, but the petitioner and local people have asked for more to which the government has not agreed till date.

During the hearing on Wednesday, the bench headed by Chief Justice Vikram Nath said that the petitioner should convince the villagers to negotiate with the authorities. If the petitioner agrees to enter negotiation, the high court proposed to set up a committee of law officer, project officer and others. This committee can listen to the grievance of the people who are likely to be evicted.

The high court has asked the petitioner to discuss with the landowners about its proposal to hold negotiation with the committee and report back on Friday, when further hearing on the subject is posted.

The high court has ordered status quo following the government’s eviction bid. The state government proposed a compensation package for 312 villagers last month.

The villagers and the petitioner are vehemently objecting to the government’s claims that the villagers were compensated earlier after acquisition, but illegally re-entered the fields and started cultivation. They insisted that the HC should order an inquiry to verify their continuous cultivation on the land.

Jaipur: City’s two proposed infrastructure projects Ramniwas Bagh parking extension and elevated road at Govind Marg are not likely to be funded by the Jaipur Smart City Limited (JSCL).

According to sources, the JSCL has expressed its helpless not to take up these projects. After UDH minister Shanti Dhariwal gave directions to conduct a survey for an elevated road from Narayan Singh Circle to Sethi Colony to de-congest Govind Marg, the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) approached the JSCL to fund the project. However, no response has been given till date.

A senior official at JDA said, “If the Centre would have approved the project under smart city, the construction would have been fast-tracked. The project will now be funded by the state government as UDH minister is keen to take up the project to provide relief to thousands of commuters,” he said.

The 2.2-km elevated road has been proposed on Govind Marg which connects busy highways leading to Agra and Delhi with heavy traffic of buses and private vehicles. The UDH department has made JDA the nodal agency to implement the project, but the cash-strapped JDA is struggling to construct the project from its own resources. “The project involves at least Rs 250 crore which the JDA is not able to bear at this juncture,” said an official at JDA.

Similarly, the Ramniwas Bagh underground parking extension might also be not included in the smart city projects list. An official at UDH said, “The JSCL has proposed to develop parking spaces near the Walled City. For this, Rs 90 crore has been proposed. It was requested to include Ramniwas Bagh parking and involve JDA for construction. However, the proposal was turned down,” the official said.

The (JDA) is planning to extend the underground parking at Ramniwas Bagh to resolve the issue of vehicular congestion in Walled City. As per the proposal, approximately 700 vehicles can be parked after extending the existing parking.

An official source said, “The underground parking is proposed to be constructed on a strip of land situated between existing parking and Mahila Chikitsalaya. Its length and width would be 584 metre into 26 metre. Once constructed, the parking space can house 1,615 vehicles. The estimated cost of the project is Rs 153 crore, if JDA got the financial support, the project would have been completed without hindrance,” the official said.

Nashik: Water resources minister Jayant Patil has asked officials to take all measures to diverting water from west-flowing rivers from Sahyadri hills towards the eastern side, thus ensuring every drop of water falling in the state is tapped and consumed for local purposes.

Patil has said that measures be taken so that the rainwater falling on the Sahyadris does not run off towards Arabian Sea and instead fully harvested and used for consumption in Godavari and Tapi basins. It would a drought-mitigation step.

The water diversion to be implemented in the region is to tap the water by constructing huge dams on the western sides of Sahyadri mountain ranges and then lift and pass it through the long tunnels towards the eastern side of the hills after which the water will flow by gravity. Based on the similar lines, the Manjarpada scheme has already been executed by the state government and it will provide water to parched regions of Chandwad and Yeola talukas.

A meeting of the water resources department officials was convened by Patil, which was attended by Nashik district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal, who is also the state civic supplies and consumer protection minister.

There are 30 river-linking inter-state projects envisioned by the Union government in 1980 as ways to mitigate drought and the problems of plenty. Of these, two inter-state projects are between Maharashtra and Gujarat (Damanganga-Pinjal project and Paar-Tapi-Narmada project).

Accordingly, there are two inter-state and four intra-state river linking projects in Maharashtra and the state government has prepared draft requesting the central government for taking up projects as part of national-river linking projects. Gujarat State is yet to confirm its participation.

According to the plans, 31 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) water will be presented to Mumbai city, the Tapi valley (Girna) will get 10.76 TMC water from Nar-Par-Girna project and 15.60 TMC of water can be made available in Godavari basin through Damanganga-Vaitarna-Godavari, Damanganga-Ekdare-Godavari and Paar-Godavari projects.

Besides, Damanganga-Pinjal project in the Upper Vaitarna will also bring in 10 TMC of water – which adds up to 67.36 TMC of water in the region.

NEW DELHI: Constable Sandeep from Delhi Traffic Police, now known as the helmet man of the city, has approached the Election Commission with a request to make helmets compulsory for supporters of political parties who are organising bike rallies for election campaigns. He has even designed some helmets for the political parties with their logos printed on either side, which can be used during campaigning.

“I have approached all the political parties with these helmets and have offered them samples so they can make similar headgear for their supporters. This will not only ensure their safety, but will also set an example for political rallies across the country,” Sandeep told TOI.

It is a common scene across the country for supporters of political parties to flout traffic rules as a show of strength. The cops admit that supporters of political parties are seldom stopped for checks since it invites more of a law and order issue than a traffic violation. The policemen are often intimidated by the supporters.

“My intention is not to complain against the parties, but to ask them as part of my duty to be more careful during rallies,” added Sandeep.

Sandeep, his wife Pinki, and his two children have been distributing helmets to bikers found riding without helmets in different parts of the city. The family distributed more than 1,000 helmets in the past two years to raise awareness.

“During my career with Delhi Police, I found that almost 90% of the road deaths involving bikers are due to not wearing helmets or wearing them wrongly. I started distributing helmets to riders hoping to turn it into an awareness campaign,” said Sandeep.

The family saves a part of its income to buy ISI-marked helmets every month. Sandeep has also roped in his children and nephew to help him spread the awareness and has even put up posters asking riders to wear helmets near Peeragarhi and Pitampura crossings.

Sandeep said he has made it a habit to distribute helmets during festive seasons and to celebrate birthdays. He said that he mainly advises women and children to follow the helmet rule since they are the most vulnerable group during an accident.

“Since political parties are the biggest influencers for people, I decided to take to take up the issue of riding without helmets with this unique method,” he said.

CM YS Jaganmohan Reddy

VIJAYAWADA: It seems, the petition moved by late Y S Vivekananda Reddy ’s daughter, Narreddy Sunitha seeking CBI probe into the murder of her father, has given new ammunition to the opposition to target the YSRC government.

The latest development has embarrassed chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy as the petition has been moved by his cousin raising doubts over other family members.

State BJP president Kanna Lakshmi Narayana said attempts are being made to implicate innocent persons in the case and save real culprits. He said he was the one who demanded for a CBI enquiry even before Y S Jaganmohan Reddy did when the incident took place.

On the other hand principal opposition, the TDP, also trained its guns at the chief minister. MLC Buddha Venkanna on Wednesday questioned the chief minister about his silence on the murder of his paternal uncle.

“He demanded a CBI inquiry when he was the opposition leader and moved high court seeking directions for the same but even after seven months of being in office, why has he not taken any action on the issue” he asked.

Venkanna further alleged that Jaganmohan is afraid of handing the case over to the CBI as he did not want to bring the real culprits to the book.

“With the questions raised by Sunitha in her petition, it seems obvious that Jaganmohan Reddy is trying to save the perpetrators who conspired and killed Vivekananda Reddy,” he said, adding that a detailed probe is needed in the case.

Meanwhile, TDP spokesperson Varla Ramaiah alleged that after feeling deceived by his brother Sunitha approached the high court for justice. Sunitha and her family members expected that Jaganmohan Reddy would hand over the case to CBI after coming to power but on the contrary the investigation has slowed down since he took office, he said. Speaking about Jaganmohan Reddy’s Hyderabad tour, Ramaiah alleged “Why is he going to Hyderabad and to save whom?”.

This was the 11th car to be stolen in the city this year. TOI had earlier highlighted how this means that in January, almost every third day a car was lifted from the city.

According to the FIR, Dr Uttam Singh (44), a resident of Ruchi Khand under Aashiana police station, had parked his SUV outside his house. On Sunday, after returning home from his clinic in Bangla Bazar, he parked his vehicle on the road outside his house around 8.30pm. The next morning, when he went out around 9.30am, the car was gone.

Singh looked around but could not find the vehicle. He called the police and lodged a complaint.

Aashiana station house officer Sanjay Ray said, “We are scanning CCTV camera footage in the area to identify the miscreants and trace their route.” According to police, burglars target mid-range SUVs, mostly white in colour and parked outside the house. Most of the vehicles to be stolen are not more than four years old.

In most cases, the time of theft is between 3am and 6am. This month, five Mahindra Scorpio models across varients were lifted in the city, indicating that it is highly demanded in the resale market of stolen vehicles.

In the first phase, the government is likely to form three districts, including Araku.

The district would bigger than any other district in the Telugu states. Most of the asssembly segments in the proposed district are strongholds of Maoists. Left-wing extremism would search for scope in plain areas such as Parvathipuram, Saluru, Kurupam and Palakonda which have less hilly terrain and forested areas than Araku, Paderu, and Rampachodavaram, said sources.

Presently, nine CRPF battalions shield police stations in Visakha Agency and conduct combing operations along with Greyhounds and special party police, while two CRPF battalions and districts special party police conduct combing operations in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts.

Jaipur: The state government has revised the land rate for industry and made cheaper. The rate of land for setting up industry would now be calculated based on rate of agriculture land of a particular area instead of residential land.

To promote clean energy, it has decided to provide land at concessional rate to set up solar, wind and hybrid power projects. The government said the land for such power plants would only double of the price of agriculture land while that of other industries, it would be thrice the price of agriculture land. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has given approval to the proposal to this effect by the finance department.

The state government last year reviewing the land rate had made the land rate for industry according to rate of residential land. Because of this decision the land rate for industry had gone up drastically. Besides, stamp duty and registration cost had also gone up. This had acted as a dampener for the industry, according to the finance department.

The government had received representations from organizations and individuals over impractical land rate for industry. The stamp and registration department had asked for a review of the land rates for industry made last year.

An apartment in Begumpet that is being used to run a men’s hostel

SECUNDERABAD: Hostels being operated illegally in apartment complexes in Mayur Marg and Prakash Nagar areas of Begumpet are raising the hackles of residents. Locals said the hostels have become a menace and questioned GHMC officials for granting permission to managements to run the hostels in residential colonies.

While serious questions are being asked at the way these hostels are being run — if they follow fire safety norms or if they adhere to building regulations, residents are also upset because the hostels have become ‘addas’ for inmates who loiter till late in the night in the colonies. This, residents say, puts women and girls at grave risk.

Not just this, noise pollution and traffic snarls have gone up with hostellers roaming merrily around on their motorbikes till late hours.

“We feel like we are living in a crowded market. Even in the early hours, we experience a lot of disturbance due to the presence of noisy hostellers near our apartment. The entire area looks like a crowded hostel now,” said a resident of Mayur Apartments. He urged GHMC authorities and police officials to first vacate the hostellers and then shut down all the hostels in the area.

Begumpet falls under GHMC Secunderabad zone. M Venkata Rama Rao, 65, of Prakash Nagar said most hostels are run illegally. “We are spending sleepless nights because of the presence of hostels. How could GHMC grant permission to these hostels in residential areas? We have pleaded with hostel managements to relocate to some other place but our pleas have fallen on deaf ears,” said Rao.

Residents wonder if GHMC verifies the trade licences and monitors fire safety in these hostels. “The hostels have turned our locality into a tinder box. A majority of them do not follow fire safety norms. Basic infrastructure like an exhaust fan in the kitchen is missing but the officials have turned a blind eye towards these violations,” pointed out another woman.

When contacted, GHMC officials said they would inspect the hostels very soon and take appropriate action.

“Till date, the residents have not approached us. I have instructed the deputy commissioner to inspect the hostels. I will also inspect the areas and take suitable action,” said Srinivas Reddy, GHMC zonal commissioner, Secunderabad.

Bombay high court

NASHIK: The Bombay high court has directed municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game to be present in the court on Friday (January 30) morning.

Congress’ corporator Hemlata Patil had moved court, questioning the Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC ) on its decision to outsource the work of 700 sanitation workers to a contractor finalised by the civic administration. Patil has alleged that there were irregularities in the outsourcing contract.

On December 12, Justices J Kathawala and P B Kulabawala had stayed the outsourcing of the sanitation work. The next hearing was to be on January 8 but was deferred to Thursday (January 29).

“During the hearing, my lawyer Sachin Shinde brought to the judges’ notice the discrepancies in the information provided by NMC lawyer. The information stated that the municipal corporation had not given any work order to the contractor concerned and there was no intention to give ant work order to that contractor,” said Hemlata Patil. She added, “But we produced the documents related to the bank guarantee that the NMC had sought from the contractor along with other papers.”

“When the judges pulled up the lawyer for providing the wrong information, the NMC lawyer said that such information had been given by the municipal commissioner. Therefore, the HC has directed municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game to be present before the court at 11 am on Friday,” she said.

When contacted, Game confirmed that he has been summoned to the court on Friday. “The respondent agency made some statements during the hearing and I have been called by the court to clarify on them,” said Game.

While the NMC general body had given its approval to outsource 700 sanitation workers for 1 year at the cost of Rs 20 crore a few months back, the standing committee had approved to work order to a contractor for three years at Rs 77 crore, with additional Rs 17 crore. Moreover, the work order was to be given to the contractor who was earlier allegedly blacklisted by the civic body.

This had sparked allegations of corruptions by some corporators from Congress and Shiv Sena in NMC. Congress corporator Hemlata Patil had moved the high court.

NMC show cause notice to 13 contractors

The NMC has served show cause notices to 13 contractors of the central kitchen after some irregularities were found during the civic administration’s probe. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game had set up a committee of NMC officials. The committee recently submitted the report to Game. NMC sources said all 13 contractors were found violating norms while providing mid-day meals to students.

He also said that while prison staff themselves instruct the prisoners, inmates with educational qualifications also chip in to teach other inmates.

“Our aim is to see that inmates pick up certain skills during their stay here that will help them earn their livelihood once they are out of jail,” Saidaiah said.

There are 335 graduates and 109 post graduates serving time in Telanagana jails. If any of these prisoners are interested in imparting education to other inmates, their services are utilised.

Prison officials said that prisoners who need to find jobs once they have completed their jail term or get out on bail, find it easier to get work if they acquire these basic skills.

NASHIK: Illegal farming and water pollution are some of the challenges being faced by the state forest department for protecting the Nandur Madhyameshwar wetland — first Ramsar Site in Maharashtra.

A forest department official on Wednesday said they are preparing a blue print to protect the wetland from encroachment and water pollution. The blue print is expected to be ready by February-end and will be sent to the state government for its approval.

“We are facing challenges like illegal farming and water pollution. The wetland is spread over 1,200 hectare. Hence, we are preparing the blue print to tackle these issues effectively,” said AN Anjankar, conservator of forests (Wildlife), Nashik.

“The blue print will include measures like demarcation of boundaries of Nandur Madhyameshwar wetland to avoid encroachment by farmers,” he added.

Untreated water released by Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) into river Godavari is also leading to pollution of the wetland. “We will soon approach the civic administration on this issue. Water hyacinth is also another issue and we are planning to remove them manually,” Anjankar said.

Assistant forest conservator Bharat Shinde said the status of Ramsar site to Nandur Madhyameshwar wetland will help in conservation, receive national and international co-operation along with funds from the central government, boost tourism and generate employment.

Nandur Madhyameshwar wetland in Niphad taluka has been declared “Wetland of International Importance” and included in the List of Wetlands of International Importance established by Article 2.1 of the Convention on Wetlands. The site number is 2,410 in the world list and it is the 31st Ramsar site in the country and first in Maharashtra.

SECUNDERABAD: A video of a Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) woman official assaulting a man with her footwear in the middle of a road went viral on Wednesday. The man, a Transco lineman, was reportedly constructing a building illegally at Picket. After the incident, both parties lodged police complaints against each other.

Based on the complaint lodged by SCB surveyor Sarita, Marredpally police registered a case against the man. However, they referred the man’s complaint to court.

On Monday, Transco lineman Dasaradhram was constructing a building in a plot despite a status quo order from high court, Marredpally police said. Though officials warned him in the past not to take up construction, he allegedly did not heed, police added.

“According to surveyor Sarita, she and her staff when they reached Dasaradhram’s residence at Picket to serve notice on him on Monday, he took objection and behaved in a high-handed manner,’’ Marredpally inspector Mattaiah told TOI.

As she was about to sit on a bike while having a verbal spat with Dasaradhram, who was levelling allegations against her, the issue escalated. Sarita lost her cool, disembarked from the bike, took out her footwear and started attacking Dasaradhram, questioning repeatedly, “How dare you say that?’’ The entire incident was captured by a bystander on his mobile and uploaded on social media.

The inspector said the dispute started when Dasaradhram applied for building permission and the SCB authorities, after processing his application, cited some deficiencies. Later, the matter reached the court.

After Monday’s fracas, Sarita claimed Dasaradhram restrained her from performing her duty besides accusing her with objectionable language. Police registered an FIR on her complaint.

Dasaradhram, in his complaint, alleged that he was assaulted and harassed. His complaint was referred to a local court.

LUCKNOW: Tax and non-tax revenue receipts of the state government, till December 2019 of the FY 2019-20, a copy of which is with TOI, show that while it did relatively better in tax revenue side, it’s the non-tax revenue is alarming.

The budget expenditure for FY 2019-20 was Rs 4,79,701 crore.

However, with two supplementary budgets, the size of the budget has increased to nearly Rs 4,97,506 crore, necessitating greater revenue mobilisation by the state government.

Both in comparison to last FY 2018-19 and the overall performance of this financial year till the last quarter in December, non- tax revenue collection has been dismal.

In respect of tax revenue, the target for FY 2019-20 was Rs 1,40258 crore while till December 2019 it achieved Rs 93,331 crore, which is 66 .5 per cent of the total target.

For the FY 2019-20, the target under this head was Rs 16,756 crore.

However, till December last, it achieved only Rs 5701 crore, clocking just 34.7 per cent of the total target.

The cumulative achievement against the target till December was only 46.4 per cent.

In the non-tax revenue side, revenue collection was better last year, as by December 2018, it was 58.5 per cent while this year till December 2019 it was around 34.3 per cent.

“If the state government is unable to cover its shortfalls in revenue receipts in the remaining months of the current financial year, this would entail a serious financial crunch,” said economist Rajeshwar Tyagi.

Non-tax revenue largely comprises taxes recovered from general public as fee by the state machinery. Non-tax revenue mainly includes mining, irrigation, forest and wildlife, police, PWD (from state roads and bridges), housing and labour and employment.

Taxes from mining stagnated as 33.2 per cent of the total target of Rs 4,400 crore, irrigation 37.8 per cent, PWD 33.6 per cent and crop and other agriculture activities 39.2 per cent.

The total target under this non tax revenue head was Rs 16,766 crore while the achievement of the target is just 34 per cent which is 39.6 per cent less as compared to the target of FY 2018-19.

However, in the tax revenue side, the performance of the government is relatively better.

Under the excise head, the collection is 61.8 per cent, stamp and registration 63.7, transport 67.3, and other revenue receipts are also showing an impressive recovery by 75.3 per cent.

Under the tax revenue, the total target was Rs 1,40,258.59 crore and the recovery till December end has been Rs 93,331.95 crore with an average achievement of Rs 66 .5 per cent which is on the higher side by 4. 8 per cent this year.

In the tax revenue side, collection has been good, barring land revenue which clocked a shortfall and achieved just 39.7 per cent, which is less compared to the last year.

Aurangabad: Almost a week after registering a case of criminal breach of trust and cheating against three people, including the director of a private sports firm, former Indian cricketer Mohammad Azharuddin and his personal assistant, the AURANGABAD city police have initiated the process of filing a ‘C’ summary and closing of the case.

Authorities said the case is being closed as the defaulted amount has been paid by one of the suspects.

Based on the complaint lodged by Mohammed Shahab, an air-ticketing agent, the City Chowk police, in the wee hours of January 22, booked the trio for duping the city-based agent to the tune of Rs 20.96 lakh.

The ticketing agent had alleged that multiple tickets for international destinations were booked by sports firm director Sudheesh Avikkal on behalf of former cricketer Mohammed Azharuddin . He also alleged that he was not paid for the tickets despite being promised from time to time. The initial calls for booking of tickets were made from the cell phone of Azharuddin’s personal assistant Mujeeb Khan.

The complainant had pointed out how 27 return tickets were booked in a span of four days for foreign destinations. On these tickets, Avikkal along with Azharuddin flew to different destinations in Europe.

Aurangabad commissioner of police Chiranjeev Prasad told TOI, “On carrying out a thorough probe, we found that Azharuddin was not at fault. It was the director of the sports firm who was the tour organiser and the one that was at fault for not paying the air ticketing agent. He made the initial calls from the cricketer’s PA’s cellphone.”

Prasad said while the probe was underway, Khan turned up with a demand draft of the said amount and handed it over to the air ticketing agent, following which the process for filing a ‘C’ summary has been initiated.

298,['30/01/2020'],Coronavirus outbreak: Bookings of tourists from China to Rajasthan get cancelled,"This story is from January 30, 2020

The number of cancellations is likely to be between 250 and 300.

JAIPUR: Following the outbreak of coronavirus, bookings of Chinese tourists to visit Rajasthan have now been cancelled, with tour operators and travel agents saying that the impact could only be offset if global tourists to China get diverted to India. While the impact of the cancellations have an immediate impact on tourism , it will take time for tour operators to reschedule travel plans that would also benefit India.

Former president of Rajasthan Association of Tour Operators (RATO) Khalid Khan said, “Bookings of Chinese tourists to Rajasthan have been cancelled from today. The numbers could be around 250-300 across all the operators.”

He said this will certainly impact the tourism and hospitality industry and occupancies at hotels will take a beating, however limited it may be. But there is an expectation that the impact of the cancellations will be neutralized if some of the global tourists visiting China get diverted to India by rescheduling tour itinerary.

“Diverting tourists will take at least a week. If we can manage some groups from the rescheduled itinerary of the global tourists, there is a chance to offset some impact,” said Mohan Singh Mertiya, general manager of a leading tour operator in the city.

Rajasthan attracted about 17.54 lakh foreign tourists in 2018 with France, the UK, the US, Germany, Australia and Italy being among the top 10 markets. China is not big market but the growth rates of foreign tourist inflows into the state are in the single digits which means any small drop in footfalls will have a big impact on the numbers, said a tour operator.

As per United Nations World Tourism Organisation, Chinese tourists are the biggest spenders globally, outpacing the Americans. Similarly, their numbers are the largest when it comes to outbound. According to experts, recent trends suggest that Chinese travelers prefer destinations that are rich in culture, heritage, and authentic experiences.

“To any country or state of India, China is an important tourism market. While many of the countries are wooing them, India is yet to get a sizeable share and the recent bilateral relationships does not help,” said a senior official at the state tourism department.

Tirupati: In the wake of the mahant of Sri Swami Hathiramji Mutt being sacked on grounds of irregularities, a demand has arisen from various quarters to inspect its bank lockers to find jewels presented to Lord Venkateswara by Sri Krishnadeveraya.

While the whereabouts of the ornaments donated by Krishnadevaraya in the 16th century to Lord Venkateswara continue to intrigue people, TTD has maintained that it has no records of any ornaments presented to the Lord by the Vijayanagara emperor.

Although the TTD has tried to allay fears of the devotees , claiming that all the jewellery of Lord Venkateswara at the Tirumala temple are still intact even today, several findings by experts , have established that the Vijayanagara emperor had presented a number of ornaments to Lord Venkateswara. And temples inscriptions bear evidence. About a decade ago, HKU had conducted a research on Krishnadevaraya’s gifts to the Tirumala temple and brought out a 900-page compendium titled ‘Inscriptions of Sri Krishnadevaraya’.

According to the university findings, there are about 45 inscriptions on the Tirumala temple walls with detailed reference to the ornaments gifted by Sri Krishnadevaraya.

Similarly, the director of the archaeology and museums in Hyderabad had mentioned in his report in 2011 that a 20-member team found that inscriptions on the walls of the Tirumala temple mention ornaments donated by Sri Krishnadevaraya. But the report also adds no ornament with the temple tallied with any of those donated by the emperor.

In 2018, following a plea filed by one BKSR Ayyangar, the Central Information Commission (CIC) had asked the Archaeological Survey of India, the culture ministry, Andhra Pradesh government and the TTD, “Where are the ornaments donated by Krishnadevaraya?”

In the same plea, the appellant had pointed out that before the administration of the Tirumala temple passed from the Hathiramji Mutt mahants to the TTD in 1933, 250 jewellery items were in Chittoor district court’s custody and in State Bank of India lockers at Chandragiri.

New Delhi: Hundreds of Dwarka residents held a peaceful protest in the form of a candlelight march against Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) on the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi , demanding that the laws be changed and the violence against the citizens of the city be stopped immediately.

Residents said the march was organised to safeguard the Constitution. “We paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi and took a pledge to safeguard the Constitution from all forms of assault, including CAA, NRC and NPR,” said Shabnam Hashmi.

The rally started from the overground parking facility near Sector 12 City Centre Mall at 6pm and culminated outside DDA Sports Complex in Sector 11. The participants walked for over four kilometres in Dwarka.

Barely five minutes after the walk had begun, around 70-80 people tried to disrupt the walk and started shouting slogans in support of the citizenship act. However, heavy police deployment ensured that there was no further confrontation. Throughout the walk, the group of CAA supporters also walked along.

“We live in a city where any document can be procured if you have the money. But what about the poor? We are here to protest for their right,” said Naim Ahmad. The programme ended with songs and poetry, apart from speeches from volunteers. The Preamble was also read.

“This was perhaps the first such rally in Dwarka where people from all communities came together to propagate the message of peace and harmony,” said Pratap Dhunta.

307,['30/01/2020'],Governor asked to look into Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University poll,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Representative image

AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad bench of Bombay High Court has asked Maharashtra governor, an officio chancellor of the state universities, to look into the grievances related to senate polls for the graduate category of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University (Bamu) in accordance with the law.

The poll in question was challenged on a technical ground — that the winning candidate had not submitted a Non-Creamy Layer certificate along with his nomination form.

The winning candidate was elected on a seat reserved for DT (VJ)/NT category for polls held as per the Maharashtra Universities Act, 2016.

While petitioner Hanumant Gutte had already raised the issue with the office of chancellor, the two-member bench of justices Mangesh Patil and S V Gangapurwala has requested the chancellor to decide the matter expeditiously. The Bamu authorities and the government pleader, have been asked by the court to communicate the court order to the office of the Chancellor.

As per the election programme, the list of validly contesting candidates was published by Bamu registrar, who was the ex-officio returning officer on November 19, 2017. The polls in question were held on December 4, 2017. Total of five candidates, including the petitioner, were in the race for the polls.

Advocate Shirish Kamble, who was representing the petitioner, said the issue of non-submission of the Non-Creamy Layer certificate was brought to the notice of the Bamu authorities during early stages. “The university authorities ignored our objection and released the list of contesting candidate. Later, we approached the office of the chancellor but in vain, following which we went to the court. With legal intervention, now we hope that the matter is resolved as early as possible,” he said.

During one of the hearings in the case on September 3 last year, the court had asked the assistant government pleader to take instructions about the status of the application of the petitioner with the office of the chancellor and the court was told that no instructions were received back then.

The petitioner argued their legal suite on the court’s verdict in the case of Aishwarya Patil Vs State of Maharashtra, in which it was ruled that the candidates cannot take benefits of reserved seat until they submit the Non-Creamy Layer Certificate.

Gutte said it was unfortunate that his objection has been ignored for over two years after the election “We had raised objection with the office of chancellor on May 22, 2018, but did not receive any response. We hope that the office of chancellor takes steps to ensure justice,” he said.

JAIPUR: Station house officer (SHO) of Begu in Chittorgarh Virendra Singh, who was arrested by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) on a complaint by local MLA Rajendra Singh Bidhuri on attempt to bribe him was granted bail by the Rajasthan High Court on Wednesday. The single bench of Justice Mahendra Goyal granted bail to the accused claiming another accused in the case who purportedly acted as the middle man between the SHO and the MLA was given bail.

The court granted bail on a personal bond of Rs 50,000 and two sureties of Rs 25,000 each.

Anil Upman, counsel for the petitioner, argued that the accused has been in custody since September 26 and chargesheet in the case has been filed on November 21 last year, but prosecution sanction has not been granted yet resulting in his prolonged custody without authority.

He argued that co-accused from whom recovery of tainted money was made has been granted bail by the court.

Public prosecutor while opposing bail said there was serious allegation of offering money to a legislator and the authorities had not yet given prosecution sanction of the accused. Singh had volunteered to give a hefty bribe to Bhiduri to retain his plum posting in the area, long been notorious for alleged nexus between cops and illegal opium husk (doda post) and opium traders. Both Singh and his hawala trader Himanshu Agarwal were arrested by ACB on July 17, 2019.

Aurangabad: A nayab tehsildar posted in Georai taluka of Beed district, about 125 km from here, was arrested by the anti-corruption bureau for accepting a bribe of Rs 1 lakh from a sand trader for releasing his vehicle. Police also arrested another man along with the tehsildar in connection with the case.

The arrested suspects have been identified as Pralhad Sadashivrao Lokhande (47) and Syed Majed (39). A case against the duo has been registered with the Georai police station under relevant sections of Prevention of Corruption Act, following which they were officially arrested.

ACB authorities said that the suspect revenue staffer took the bribe amount through the other suspect. Superintendent of police (ACB) Arvind Chawria said that recently, the revenue department officials had intercepted a truck carrying sand and had blamed him for stealing the sand and carrying it without paying royalty.

Meanwhile, the tehsildar allegedly demanded bribe of Rs one lakh from the truck owner for releasing the vehicle. Unwilling to grease palms of the revenue staffer, he reached out to Beed ACB office and lodged a complaint in this regard.

A team of ACB, in the presence of a government panch carried out verification of the complaint, only to find that the revenue staffer demanded the bribe amount for releasing the vehicle. Accordingly, a trap was laid on Wednesday afternoon at the tehsildar office in Georai. The tehsildar asked the victim to hand over the said amount to the other suspect. It was soon after the other suspect accepted the powdered currency notes, a team led by deputy superintendent of police Balkrishna Hanpude arrested him, while another team nabbed the nayab tehsildar before he could flee from his office.

Jaipur: The family of the 13-year-old girl — who died after a portion of a building fell on her in Brahmpuri area on Tuesday — has filed a case of causing death by negligence against the contractor of the building. Cops are investigating the case though no arrests have been made yet.

The victim, identified as Lakshmi Kumari, died on the spot after a massive chunk of the wall fell on her. The incident happened at around 4.30pm on Tuesday at a mall situated at Nagar Nigam Colony on Ramgarh Road.

“The girl’s family has registered a case against the contractor of the building claiming that it was his negligence which caused the girl’s death. We will investigate the matter and if we find that there was negligence on part of the contractor and others, the action will be taken accordingly.”

The girl and her family, who work as labourers, lived in a makeshift tin shed just below the building. The girl was inside the shed when she was crushed to death after a chunk of the fifth-floor wall fell on the roof of the shed.

“There was some construction work going on in the building and we still have to check if it was the new construction part or the old structure which crushed the girl. The proximity of the tin shed which was the family’s home, also increased the chances of this incident happening. We will check if any security measures were put in place to prevent such an occurrence,” said the official. The building is owned by a private group and Jaipur Municipal Corporation officials on Tuesday had also said that they will look into the matter.

The victim’s post-mortem was done on Wednesday and the body was handed over to the family. A case under IPC Section 304 A (causing death due to negligence) has been registered.

PANAJI: A study commissioned by the 15th Finance Commission found that Goa is the best performing state in terms of collections of state taxes for the 2012-17 period.The study, conducted by the Centre of Excellence in Fiscal Policy and Taxation (CEFT), found that the average sales tax effort is higher in low income states than both high and middle income states.A separate report on measurable performance-based incentives for states prepared by the National Council of Applied Economic Research found that four states – Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Goa and Mizoram – receive a higher proportionate incentive than their population share for their performance on five indicators picked by the 15th Finance Commission.CEFT was tasked with conducting a study to calculate the tax effort made by 18 states and preparing a report on the projection of tax revenue on petroleum products and sales tax and state’s own tax revenue (SOTR).“The range of the tax effort index is found to be varying from 61.18% for Maharashtra to 169.56% for Goa. Tax efforts of Goa, Assam, Bihar, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are above 100, while that of Punjab, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu are below it,” the CEFT report said.Tax effort is generally measured as the ratio of the actual tax collection to gross domestic product (GDP). A high tax effort indicates that the state government, in this case the department of commercial taxes, has efficiently tapped Goa’s limited tax base to collect tax revenue for the state.The 18 states were classified into three categories on the basis of their per capita income; low, middle and high income states. Goa, classified as a high income category, bucked the trend which showed that low-income states made a stronger effort on the tax collection front.Given the diverse nature of the states in the country, not all states can earn revenue on par with their capital expenditure and as a result many states face fiscal constraints. “It is imperative for the states to look for alternative avenues to improve tax effort and expand revenue mobilization to keep in pace with the growing demand for public expenditures,” the report said.Several finance commissions have acknowledged the importance of tax effort as a criteria while devolving shared tax and grants-in-aid to states.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73753862,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-544600,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-ranked-best-performer-for-collections-of-state-taxes/articleshow/73746409.cms

LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh jail minister J K Singh Jaiki has said that it was not necessary for a “leader” to be educated as educated people were “spoiling” the atmosphere.

“A leader need not be educated, he should have a vision. He has a team to look after work,” Singh said at a function in Sitapur on Tuesday. A video of the speech made by Singh, who is an Apna Dal MLA from Jahanabad, went viral.

In the video, whose authenticity TOI could not verify, Singh is seen even saying that educated bureaucrats were misguiding people.

“Jab IAS, PCS (officers) meeting mein baithtey hain toh kehte hain wo neta high school pass hai...inter pass hai...usko kuch aata jata nahi hai. Bina padhey likhe log padhey logon ko chalate hain. Vyapak taur se padhey likhe log galat mahaul paida karte hain...leader ko padhne likhne ki koi zaroorat nahi hai (When IAS and PCS officers sit in meetings they say the leaders have got education till high school or intermediate and they don’t know anything. They say uneducated people are instructing the educated ones. But educated people are spoiling the atmosphere. A leader need not be educated),” he said.

Singh, who is a graduate, said he was a minister and had a personal assistant and other staff at his disposal.

Apna Dal was quick to distance itself from the minister’s comment. Party spokesperson Rajesh Patel said the minister might have spoken in some other context.

314,['30/01/2020'],BJP now comes up with a video of mohalla clinics to target AAP,"This story is from January 30, 2020

New Delhi: A day after targeting Aam Aadmi Party on the state of Delhi government schools , Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday said the condition of mohalla clinics in the capital was equally deplorable .

In a tweet, BJP national president JP Nadda alleged that AAP had promised to open 1,000 mohalla clinics when it assumed power in 2015 and “kept repeating” it every year, but failed to fulfil it.

Quoting Nadda’s tweet, which had a video of people alleging that there were no facilities for tests and scans at mohalla clinics, doctors were irregular and conditions were unhygienic, Shah said the purported revolution brought by AAP had been “exposed”.

“For the sake of your selfish politics, you have committed the sin of playing with the lives of the poor in Delhi by keeping them away from (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi ji’s Ayushman Bharat Yojana. You will give an answer to this,” Shah said on the micro-blogging site.

AAP did not respond to the allegations. Under Ayushman Bharat scheme, people below the poverty line get free treatment of up to Rs 5 lakh every year.

BJP said its Delhi MPs visited mohalla clinics across the city and found their conditions “deplorable”. South Delhi MP Ramesh Bidhuri visited three mohalla clinics in Dakshinpuri, Prahladpur in Tughlakabad and Sangam Vihar near Batra Cinema. Bidhuri told reporters that he found a lot of dirt and filth outside all three places.

East Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir tweeted that the clinic he visited was a “marvel” of AAP’s healthcare revolution and only had airconditioners, water tanks and empty cabinets. “Maybe the medicines have been shifted somewhere!” he tweeted.

However, a ground check by TOI found that at three places, these accounts were exaggerated and the situation was not as bad as it was being made out to be. (see graphic)

The AAP government has set up more than 400 mohalla clinics, which provide free medicines and lab tests to people. These clinics have been set up in small places belonging to various Delhi government agencies. Since most parcels of land in Delhi belong to the Centre, it was a challenge for the AAP government to find space to set up the facilities.

In the last one year, the Kejriwal government managed to take the number of clinics from about 100 to over 400.

The clinics provide diagnostics and treatment of simple ailments. With growing number of patients, the government has also started double shifts at select mohalla clinics. Delhi government has also started renting private properties to set up the facilities and posted additional staff to provide treatment to people.

In December 2012, GSIDC was appointed to construct, reconstruct and maintain all government schools

PORVORIM: The task of constructing, reconstructing, repairing, upgrading and maintaining all government schools in the state will be carried out through the public works department ( PWD ) instead of the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation ( GSIDC ).

The cabinet on Wednesday approved a proposal reappointing PWD for undertaking all infrastructure works involving government schools, including primary, middle, secondary and higher secondary institutions. “GSIDC being a centralised agency, it becomes difficult for them to execute the works, whereas PWD has its divisions throughout the state and it is better placed to undertake such urgent repair works. Hence, it is decided to revert to the earlier system of carrying work through PWD,” read the cabinet note.

Earlier, PWD was responsible for the maintenance of government schools, but in December 2012, GSIDC was appointed to construct, reconstruct and maintain the institutions.

The decision to bring the construction and maintenance of government schools under GSIDC was taken by former chief minister Manohar Parrikar.

“He thought we could do a better job than PWD, and the work was entrusted to us,” a GSIDC official said.

In 2012, a total of 894 government primary schools were operational. However, the number reduced due to various reasons like nil enrolment and amalgamation.

As stated in the cabinet note, 467 schools have been repaired by GSIDC till date, while in 239 schools work is in progress. The ongoing works will be completed by GSIDC latest by December 2020.

The government schools which have been already constructed, repaired and renovated by GSIDC will be maintained by PWD.

To avoid any kind of duplication of work, and to facilitate a smooth transition, GSIDC will provide a list of completed as well ongoing and pending works, to PWD. There are 742 government primary schools, 42 middle schools, 78 high schools and 9 government higher secondary schools in the state .

Amaravati: Minister for municipal administration Botcha Satyanarayana on Wednesday said the government was in no hurry to issue an ordinance regarding the setting up of three capital cities.

He, however, said that the government was committed to make Visakhapatnam, the executive capital city.

The minister said the government would wait for the completion of the legislative process to take the final call. Botcha criticized TDP for backing the GN Rao committee report after burning it in the bonfire only a few days ago. Admitting that GN Rao committee had said Visakhapatnam has threat from cyclones, Botcha said the city would not get washed away in cyclones.

The minister said all the coastal districts, including Vizag are prone to be hit by cyclones and it was not a new finding. “We have not said that we are going to prevent cyclones and natural calamities. The high-level committee studied the reports of the experts’ committees and put its recommendations before the government. This government is committed to take measures keeping all the suggestions of the committees in mind,” said Botcha.

He lashed out at TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu for changing his stance according to his convenience. He said Naidu had burnt the reports of the GN Rao committee and BCG on Bhogi Day and appealed to his party cadres to do so. Naidu took a U-turn to defend the GN Rao committee report for his convenience, said Botcha. “How could Naidu defend the report now,” asked Botcha.

KERI/BICHOLIM: Days after cattle killings in Sattari, four buffaloes were killed in Huland along the Karnataka-Maharashtra border on Wednesday just outside Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary.

A forest department official suspects that it could be the same tiger that killed a buffalo of the Pingale family in Surla-Sattari earlier this month. He said that the tiger appears to have moved away in the Tillari basin, where Damadar Gawade’s buffaloes became the latest victims.

When a tiger killed a buffalo in the forests of Surla, deputy conservator of forests Vikas Desai had visited the spot and instructed forest staff to patrol the area. However, the tiger moved to Huland, 4km from the Goa border, sources said.

Rama Bodke, from Kankumbi said, “As Damodar Gawade depended on the buffaloes for his livelihood, Karnataka forests department should take immediate steps to provide compensation.”

The Huland incident occurred two days after a farmer complained that 10 of his cattle had been killed by wildcats in Ladfe in Bicholim taluka.

A complaint in this connection was lodged by cattle owner Babu Nana Varak from Ladfe with the forest department. He said that a wild cat (tiger or leopard) killed eight cows and two calves as a result of which he has suffered a loss of Rs 80,000.

“ I heard the roar of the wild animal and cries of my cattle,” said Varak. The complaint adds that their lives are also at risk as the cattle were killed in human habitats.

322,['30/01/2020'],West Bengal: No CC for New Town buildings left uncovered during construction,"NKDA official said, the clause for putting up a dust-protective cover would be introduced in the building-plan... Read More

TimesView This step was necessary. New Town has seen— and will go on seeing—a fair bit of construction activity. Dust from these sites, besides being a short-term nuisance, contribute majorly to long-term air-pollution problems.

KOLKATA: Buildings coming up in New Town may not get completion certificate (CC) if the structures are not covered in cloth, jute or any other dust-preventive material during construction. The contractors concerned may also be issued stop-construction notices if they fail to adhere to the instructions. In a bid to arrest the spread of dust and fall of rubble on the road, the New Town Kolkata Development Authority has decided to include such a clause in its building plan sanction rules and put up the notification on its website soon.During a board meeting of the NKDA on January 27, a special resolution was adopted to address the issue, recognising the fact that the construction dust and debris were definitely big pollutants that affected the people living in the neighbourhood. So, an NKDA official said, the clause for putting up a dust-protective cover would be introduced in the building-plan sanction permit. “The construction area or buildings should be wrapped by cloth or jute or other dust protected material to act as dust barriers. Actions as appropriate for reduction of dust and elimination of possibility of debris or dust outside own property shall also be taken,” it would read.“First, showcause notices will be sent to the plot owners who fail to follow the rules. If they refuse to toe the line even after that, a stop-construction notice may be slapped and their completion certificate may also be barred,” the NKDA official said. “Steps have to be taken to minimise air and noise pollution that comes with rapid urbanization.”Welcoming the move, structural architecture consutant Anjan Kumar Dutta said, “There is a provision of a fine of Rs 50,000 for piling construction materials on the road outside a plot. Abroad, construction agencies water the under-construction structures to prevent dust from rising. The step that the NKDA authorities are taking is good.” Echoing him, Nandu Belani, president of Credai Bengal, said, “Construction sites should be properly covered to prevent pollution. Most real estate developers do follow the rule and take measures to minimise dust pollution from construction sites.”Residents of the township are also happy with the decision. “It’s great NKDA is looking into the matter. Dust and noise pollution from construction sites have been a constant worry and the move would hopefully help,” said Kaustav Dey, a resident of Action Area 1B.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73758909,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-442182,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-cc-for-new-town-buildings-left-uncovered-during-construction/articleshow/73746434.cms

Aisha stated that she has huge property and wanted to donate $55,00,000 US dollar as charity to help the poor in Visakhapatnam and other parts of Andhra Pradesh . She asked Singh to send his details for further communication.

When Singh sent his personal details to via e-mail, Aisha replied that her advocate would deal with the transfer of money. A few weeks later, Singh received phones calls from various persons who posed as top officials from customs, insurance and RBI and claimed to initiate the transfer. Later, Singh deposited over Rs 6.62 lakh in a phased manner in 13 bank accounts as payment for various paperwork. Soon after Aisha disappeared.

When he neither received the funds nor any phone-call after depositing Rs 6.62 lakh, Singh lodged a complaint with the cybercrime police station in November 2019.

VISAKHAPATNAM: The eight fishermen from north Andhra, who were arrested by the Bangladesh coast guard on Oct 2 last year after their boat strayed into the neighbouring country’s waters, were released by Bangladesh on Wednesday. They would be returning to Vizag on their boat ‘Amrutha’, which has also been released.

“They set sail from Mongla port on their boat after being released from jail . The government has provided them with fuel and the Bangladesh coast guard would escort them till they reach Indian waters,” their lawyer Milon Banerjee told TOI. AP Matsyakara Samakhya state president Vasupalli Janakiram has been in Bangladesh since Jan 26 to ensure the smooth release of the fishermen, he added.

All eight fishermen hail from Thippalavalasa village in Pusapatirega mandal of Vizianagaram district, but have been living in Visakhapatnam since many years. Meanwhile, fishermen’s associations have demanded a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for each fisherman from the government. “Recently, when Pakistan released 22 AP fishermen, the chief minister personally met them in Vijayawada and announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh each. We are demanding the same amount for these eight fishermen as well,” said Arijili Dasu, executive director of Fisherfolk Foundation , a community organization for fishermen in AP.

Altogether, there were 38 Indian fishermen in Bangladesh jails and all of them were released on Wednesday morning. The rest 30 are from West Bengal. The Bagerhat senior judicial magistrate’s court had sent them to jail custody after they were arrested for straying into Bangladesh waters.

President of Catholic Association of Bengal Angelina Mantosh and priest in-charge at St Thomas Church Fr Lucas... Read More

KOLKATA: The tenets of justice, liberty, equality and brotherhood — that are the pillars of the Indian Constitution as envisaged in the Preamble — are Christian concepts, feels archbishop Thomas D’Souza of the Archdiocese of Kolkata (Roman Catholic). Hence, the churches under the Archdiocese have upheld the Preamble in recent times to remind parishioners about its importance in these changing times. This came up again and again in informal discussions of priests at a three-day meet that ended on Wednesday.

On Sunday, all the churches under the archdiocese read the Preamble after the mass to celebrate 70 years of the adoption of the Constitution. After that, the priests met for their annual three-day gathering to discuss matters related to churches and seek solutions to problems, if any. Both the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of North India have taken lead roles in organising anti-CAA programmes across the city.

While Bishop Paritosh Canning of the CNI was seen leading a procession from St Paul’s Cathedral to Gandhi statue, D’Souza was seen bonding with leaders of other faiths in forming a human chain to uphold the Constitution. Vicar general Dominic Gomes took the lead in getting Preambles printed to be distributed at churches for reading after mass.

“I feel that the Preamble is a very Christian concept because it upholds all that is said in the Bible. The Preamble is the gist of what the Bible says — liberty or freedom, equality and brotherhood are the pillars of Christianity. So I have been saying that the Preamble has gospel-like qualities,” D’Souza said.

Priests have been saying in their prayer messages to parishioners that one can serve the country by following the Constitution and the same was is in the prayers. In context of the CAA/NRC, they advise the parishioners to stand by the poor and the vulnerable who may be scared over their inability to furnish the right documents.

There are small church communities that are trying to dispel doubts and fears in this regard. “Jesus defined freedom as ‘truth that will set one free’. Our Preamble stresses on freedom or liberty and lauds gospel values,” said the vicar general.

He quoted from Genesis 1.27 and said, “We are all brothers and sisters created in the image and likeness of God. This is akin to brotherhood or fraternity which the Preamble preaches.”

VISAKHAPATNAM: With the notification for election to the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) expected within a few months, the civic body has started to retrofit a portion of the third floor near the engineering block of the GVMC office for a new council hall . The hall is being set up at an estimated cost of Rs 2.5 crore.

The old council hall, on the first floor, now houses the newly-developed City Operations Centre.

The new council hall will have a seating capacity of 120, including 98 corporators, city MLAs, MPs and co-option members. The challenge for the GVMC, however, is finding space for chambers of the deputy mayor, floor leaders and members of standing committees. At present, the third floor houses the chambers of the chief engineer and other superintending engineers.

According to GVMC officials, the civic body may construct additional rooms for the deputy mayor and other functionaries. “Council hall works will be completed by next month. There is also a proposal to develop a multi-level parking facility in the vacant lot at the GVMC office, considering the future projected vehicular flow to the GVMC office following the functioning of the newly-elected council,” said a GVMC official.

The government fixed the number of wards under the GVMC at 98 in an official notification on January 10, following which the civic body published preliminary voter lists.

The GVMC will soon finalise ward-wise reservations based on number of voters in SC/ST/BC and women categories.

Officials from Archaeological Survey of India took record of a damaged Chola era stone inscription

TRICHY: A team from Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Mysuru, recorded an inscription from the Chola era dating back to 12th century CE in a government school in P Ayyampalayam from Manachanallur of Trichy district on Wednesday.

The ASI team visited the school based on information from the school that a stone inscription, which appeared to be age-old, was kept in the school. The inscription, which was found a few years ago on the school campus, was kept in the headmistress’ office. D Thirumavalavan, a post graduate teacher of chemistry at the school, informed ASI office in Trichy a few months ago regarding the inscription. He said that Pudukottai chief education officer (CEO) had visited the school as part of an inspection a few months ago and seen the inscription in the headmistress office. “While we told her that the stone inscription has been kept in the school for over several years, she asked us to inform the ASI about it,” he said.

After examining the stone inscription, P Balamurugan, assistant epigraphist from ASI, Mysuru, confirmed it to be from 12th century CE. “But we could not ascertain if it belongs to Chola ruler Rajarajan – II or Rajarajan – III since some of the portions are damaged,” he said. We have recorded the inscription and will further put it to scrutiny to decipher the message on it. He further said that the letters in the inscription hint on a possible land donation by the king. E Rajashree, headmistress of the school, said that it was interesting to find that the school was preserving over 900-year-old inscription. We are eagerly waiting for the ASI to find out further details and revert. We have asked our school students to inform the school if they find any such abandoned inscriptions as it may end up giving us some vital details on the history of this region, she said.

Only 25% of Goa’s plastic waste is sent to Karnataka to be used as fuel

PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Wednesday came down heavily on the state government and contractor for the delay in setting up the plastic-to-fuel plant at Pernem .

Counsel representing MK Aromatics Limited, advocate Ashwin Bhobe sought extension of time till May 15 for the plant to be commissioned stating that there was a technical snag in the reactor.

Justice Mahesh Sonak noted that the original date of completion was 2014 and sought to know why the project is taking five years to complete. He stated that the contractor should be penalised for the delay.

Counsel representing the company stated that there was a delay because the local MLA opposed the project.

The court sought a timeline from the government over the repeated extensions given to the company as well as details of the cost to the state’s exchequer for sending plastic waste to the cement factory in Karnataka to be used as fuel .

Advocate general Devidas Pangam told the court that only 25% of the state’s plastic waste is sent to Karnataka.

Counsel Norma Alvares told the court that the state is incurring expenditure by sending plastic waste to Karnataka.

Justice Sonak said that state agencies must not be taken for a ride. In December, the contractor’s project engineer Piyush Patil stated that the establishment and commissioning of the plant would be completed by Janaury 15 at the latest.

The court accepted his statement as an undertaking given to the court.

Then chief minister Manohar Parrikar had told the assembly in August 2018 that the state’s ambitious project of converting non-recycleable plastic waste into fuel would be realised in seven months.

CAG in 2018 came down heavily on the department of urban development for causing loss worth Rs 15 crore to the exchequer for setting up the plant at Pernem without any competition.

The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) found that after department officials visited the plant run by MK Aromatics Limited at Alathur near Chennai, and based on discussions with the company, a note was submitted to the state government along with the concept report and proposal for implementation of the project in Goa.

Berhampur: Twenty-five-year-old Mamata Nayak was inconsolable at MKCG Medical College and Hospital on Wednesday. Her husband, Sunil Nayak, 30, who drove the bus, died in the accident that took place early in the morning near Taptapani in Ganjam district. Now Mamata has to look after herself and her three-year-old son since Sunil was the sole bread earner of the family. “He left home for Rayagada on Monday and was driving back home. Last night he spoke to my son and told him that he will be back in the morning,” said Mamata, a homemaker, who is from Pandav Nagar.

Similar was the condition of other families at the hospital who lost their dear ones in the accident.

Unable to come to terms with reality, most were too grief-stricken to speak. Ashok Mohapatra, who works in the police department in Rayagada, lost his wife Sanghamitra and daughter Aneswa. They had boarded the bus from Rayagada around 9.30 pm to attend a marriage ceremony on Wednesday and supposed to return to celebrate Saraswati Puja at Rayagada on Thursday.

“I cannot believe that they have died,” said Mohapatra.

Similarly, Bidyut Nayak and her husband Santosh of JK Pur in Rayagada were coming in the bus to Berhampur to attend the marriage ceremony of their relative. While Bidyut died on the spot, her husband is battling for his life in the medical college. Many of their relatives thronged the hospital instead of attending the marriage ceremony.

Most of the survivors recounted the harrowing scene. G. Srikar, student of the Bachelor in Business Administration (Second year) in a private college said it was very difficult to comprehend what had happened. “I was fast asleep. There was a loud sound and then the bus had overturned. It took time for me to realise what had happened,” said Srikar of Muniguda in Rayagada.

“People were crying in panic. I started checking to see if my body parts were intact. It was nothing short of a miracle that many of us are alive,” said Srikar, who sustained multiple injuries in his face and both legs. Geetanjaili Behera, 35, who has sustained injuries on her chest and is undergoing treatment at Berhampur was restless to find about her two sons and sister. Her sons and sister sustained minor injuries and are undergoing treatment at Digapahandi hospital while she had to be shifted to Berhampur.

Bhubaneswar: The Odisha Abhibhabak Mahasangha, a state-level parents’ association, has asked the state government to centralise admissions for seats under Economically Weaker Sections ( EWS ) quota in private schools from the next academic session.

Currently, seats reserved for EWS category are being filled up directly at the whims of private schools and the process lacks transparency, alleged parents. Under the Right to Education (RTE) Act private schools are obliged to give admission to 25% EWS students at the entry level.

“It is unfortunate that the rule is only on pen and paper. Though a few schools are implementing the rules, most are violating the norm. It has come to our notice that some prominent schools in the city have sold seats reserved for EWS students to the general category students and said no one had applied for those,” alleged Basudev Bhatt, convenor of Odisha Abhibhabak Mahasangha (OAM).

The parents association had also lodged a complaint with the Odisha State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (OSCPCR) against private schools for not giving admission to students of EWS parents. The parents also staged a protest in front of the commission on Tuesday demanding action against schools that are violating the norm across the state.

Parents also alleged that the private schools do not follow the guidelines like advertising in the nearby slums before the admission process begins. Even schools are rejecting applications for admission on various grounds, they added.

“We have requested the government to come out with a centralised admission process for EWS seats in schools as it is being done in Delhi, Chandigarh and Uttar Pradesh. There should be total transparency in the process and underprivileged students will get a chance to study in private schools,” said Bhatt.

Authorities of private schools in the city said, “The state government did not reimburse the fee for students of EWS category to schools. Not only centralised mechanism for admission but the government should also come up with a mechanism to reimburse the amount to private schools on time as well,” said principal of a city-based private school, requesting anonymity.

Visakhapatnam: The district consumer forum has found a shopping mall found guilty of charging consumers for carry bags in the name of ‘common support’.

The case was filed by the Consumer Rights Organisation (CRO) after a local resident brought it to the notice of the organisation. The resident, Vinita, had been charged Rs 7.25 for a paper bag , which was added to the bill under ‘common support’.

The judgement by the consumer forum stated, “It is directed to provide free carry bags to the customers who purchased articles from the shop, if it is with their brand name. The opposite party (mall) is further directed to refund an amount of Rs 7.25 towards cost of the carry bag which was wrongly charged on the name of common support.”

“The opposite party has been directed to pay compensation of Rs 5,000 besides additional costs of Rs 2,000. The time for compliance is one month from the date of receipt of the order, failing which the above amount shall carry 12 per cent per annum interest,” read the judgement.

Speaking to TOI, Surya Bhaskaram, president of the consumer forum, said, “If the mall has its name printed on the cover, it cannot be sold to the consumer. It is the responsibility of the mall to provide its customers with bags. Selling plastic bags with the brand name turns customers into advertising agents.”

CRO state president Vikas Pandey said, “As per Consumer Protection Act, 1986, selling branded carry bags is an unfair trade practice.”

338,['30/01/2020'],"West Bengal: This February, check out German machine, vinyl used to record Rabindranath Tagore’s renditions","This story is from January 30, 2020

The recording machine that was used to record Rabindranath Tagore’s voice

KOLKATA: Birla Industrial and Technological Museum ( BITM ) is set to showcase a German machine that was used to record the renderings of poems and songs by Rabindranath Tagore. In April 1932, Tagore had recorded the poem, ‘Jokhon hobo babar moto boro’, and the song, ‘Tobu mone rekho’. The vinyl gramophone record containing his voice will also be showcased along with a gramophone, on which the record will be played.

The Georg Neumann disc recording machine that cut lathes for phonograph discs or vinyl records was imported by Hindusthan Musical Products Ltd from Germany in 1931 and installed at their recording studio in early 1932. The first voice to be recorded on the machine was that of Tagore, then 71. The renderings constituted the first Hindusthan Gramophone record released as serial No. H-1.

The German firm Georg Neumann GmbH had been founded only three years before the VMS70 disc-cutting lathe was imported to India. The machine was donated to BITM by Hindusthan Musical Products Ltd in May 1970. At the time, it was valued at Rs 7,500.

One of the discs on which Kabiguru’s renderings were recorded will not only be on display, but will also be played on an old His Master’s Voice gramophone. The wind-up model grapmophone was donated to BITM by Barin Kumar Ghosh the same time that the recording machine was and its value was pegged at a pricely Rs 100.

“We will exhibit these items in early-February. These artefacts will be the crowd-pullers in the exhibition where several other things will be displayed, including a kerosene-powered table fan and a telegraph machine that has now been phased out. We will give a demonstration on how Morse code was used to transmit messages,” said BITM director VS Ramachandran.

BITM has another connection with the bard. These premises — now 19A, Gurusaday Road, and earlier 18, Ballygunge Store Road — were purchased by the Tagore family from Mirza Abdul Karim in 1898. Meera Devi, the fourth of Rabindranath Tagore’s five children, spent a large part of her childhood in this house.

GD Birla bought the property from Surendranath Tagore in 1919 and it remained with the Birla family till its conversion into a museum in 1959.

Visakhapatnam: Heritage enthusiasts in the city recently uncovered boxes of anti-aircraft ammunition atop Daspalla Hills following land levelling work in the area.

It is believed that the ammunition in the boxes dates to World War II, when Vizag was one of the major military bases on the Eastern Front. The city was targeted and bombed by the Japanese on April 6, 1942, due to its strategic importance as a supplier of ammunition for the Allies.

“By 1942, the Japanese juggernaut had steamrollered the British, occupied Burma and was moving into the north-east. At this juncture, the British and the Americans had turned Vizag into an ammunition and supply base to prevent further inroads by the Japanese. The Allies feared that Vizag would be targeted by the Japanese air force and had virtually turned the city into a fortress,” recalled 89-year-old DN Sinha, who was in the city during air raids by the Japanese. Ammunition and other weaponry would be stocked on top of Daspalla Hills given its proximity to the coast, Sinha added.

Edward Paul, member of the Visakhapatnam chapter of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach), said, “The boxes are clearly visible. Of course there are other ruins, which we believe once housed an ammunition depot. We need to consult the Navy to shed light on the matter.”

Boxes of World War-era ammunition also dot the city coastline, said Paul.

Panaji: The directorate of education (DoE) has asked schools to observe two minutes’ silence on January 30 to mark Martyr’s Day, ‘in memory of those who gave their lives in the struggle for India’s freedom’, in keeping with the practice across the country.

“Silence should be observed, and work and movement stopped for two minutes on January 30. To observe Martry’s Day with full solemnity and in a befitting manner, it is enjoined upon all heads of government and government aided and unaided primary, secondary, higher secondary and special schools to arrange speeches and talks connected with the significance of the day,” director of education Vandana Rao has said in the circular.

The theme of the talks and speeches could also deal with ‘the duty and the moral obligation of every citizen to preserve, protect and enrich hard-earned freedom and to promote a sense of national integration and commitment to common goals and ideals’, Rao has said.

341,['30/01/2020'],Police probe what led Beliaghata mom to undergo abortion two years ago,"This story is from January 30, 2020

The Maloos’ home at Beliaghata; Sandhya Maloo (inset)

KOLKATA: Sandhya Maloo (34), who allegedly killed her two-month-old daughter ostensibly owing to physical incapacity, underwent abortion around two years ago and investigators are ascertaining what led her to take the step.

The Beliaghata homemaker, who also has an eight-year-old son, told the police that at that time, the family’s financial condition was not strong enough to have a second child, and that it was the family’s collective decision to abort the child. Sandhya’s mental status during that time is also being probed. “She has clammed up and the psychiatrists have asked us to ensure she relaxes a bit. She might open up after interacting with her son. We are seeking expert opinion and asking the family to explain what financial constraint led her to abort her child two years ago,” an officer said.

Certain internet searches by Sandhya has also caught the investigators’ attention. “We might take a look into Sandhya’s smartphone as police told us that she searched extensively on effective breastfeeding and the use of ordinary chemicals, like phenyl, on human body,” said a forensic expert. This could be significant, said an officer, as Sandhya had been maintaining her “physical incapacity” was the reason behind her killing her infant daughter. “We will also ask the family about the doctors who treated her and speak to them,” said an officer. “We have let her interact with her eight-year-old son a couple of times, hoping that would help her relax.”

Forensic experts pointed out that they were looking for clues to join the dots, connecting the victim with the accused and that the child was alone with her mother before being killed. “We have finished reconstruction. We have asked to check the adhesive tape used to gag the child, hoping to get fingerprints. We have also calculated the time and spot, where the child could have been killed, and the place, where she was found unconscious,” said an expert.

Cops said they had two independent witnesses, who were present on the spot, when Sandhya took cops to the manhole and recovered her daughter’s body. “The witnesses will be crucial to the case,” said a source. Police are yet to question Sandhya’s family members. Sandhya’s mother-in-law Madhu Maloo had, however, hinted that Sandhya had been avoiding taking care of her daughter over the past couple of weeks. “We want to record her husband Sudarshan’s statement,” an officer said.

Koraput: Police on Wednesday detained at least 10 people from Mankadajkhola village under Rayagada police station limits for interrogation in connection with the assault on two women of the village on charges of practising sorcery on Tuesday night.

Nihar Pradhan, inspector-in-charge, Rayagada police station, said, “We have detained 10 persons on suspicion of beating up the two women, who are sisters. Interrogation is on. If their involvement in the incident is established, arrests will be made.”

The two sisters have been identified by police as Sabita Jani and Gamala Muduli. They are undergoing treatment in Rayagada hospital.

Police said Santosh Jani of the village, who was down with some disease for the past few days, died on Tuesday evening. The villagers were suspicious of the sister duo of casting evil spirit on him.

Holding the duo responsible for Santosh’s death, they dragged them out of their home and beat them up mercilessly. Pradhan said, “Both women are undergoing treatment and their condition is stable.” He added that as tension still prevails in the village, adequate police personnel have been deployed and the developments are being closely monitored.

While Samoon earlier belonged to the Nagaland cadre, Ansariya served in the Uttar Pradesh cadre. According to a government order, the two opted for the AP cadre with the concurrence of the state governments of Nagaland, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh, on grounds of marriage.

Even though some IAS officers have served as additional commissioners of the GVMC, there has been no additional commissioner post at the VMRDA till date. The creation of a new post is seen as a move to strengthen the body at a time when the government plans to shift the executive capital to Vizag.

PANAJI: Certain banking rules pertaining to agriculture loans have to be tweaked in India, said CEO of the non-banking finance company, Northern Arc Capital, Kshama Fernandes.

Fernandes, who was speaking on the subject, ‘Empowering rockstars at the rock bottom – journey to an inclusive world’ at the D D Kosambi Festival of Ideas on Wednesday, said, “Agriloans are lent to buy seed, fertiliser, fodder for cattle, etc. If the farmer buys fodder for the cows, then it is considered to be an agriloan, but if he buys food for his famine-stricken family, then it’s not an agriloan. We must tweak such things in the Indian economy.”

This, she said, will ensure that there are fewer loan defaults. “Mass defaults are rarely instigated by the borrower; they are instigated by vested interests,” Fernandes, who hails from Cansaulim in South Goa, said.

She also spoke about the need to eradicate poverty and alleviate the poor.

“A significant proportion of the loans that Northern Arc has lent has reached some of the remote villages of Goa. Fortunately, the proportion of poor seen in Goa is not as high as what is seen in many of the other states,” she said during her lecture.

“We see a lot of over-lending, wherein a lot of financial institutions go and lend to the same borrower in the same geography. The opportunity really is to go wider and deeper and enrich more people,” she said.

She spoke of women in a remote village of Udaipur, who are struggling for a living, yet are able to survive owing to financial help.

TRICHY: The district administration has instructed jallikattu organisers to refrain from registering excess number of bulls for events in the district. The decision was taken after the recently held jallikattu events witnessed over 800 bulls participating on an average.

While it is not possible to release over 600 bulls within the stipulated time during a jallikattu event, it leaves the rest of the bull owners disappointed after waiting for hours together to take part in it. One of the members on the committee to monitor jallikattu events in Trichy said it is a matter of pride for the owners to get their bull to participate in the event irrespective of winning the prize. But the fact that the jallikattu event must be completed at the stipulated time makes it impossible for the organisers to allow all the bulls registered. This happens when jallikattu organisers give tokens to over 600 bulls. The member said up to 1,400 bulls were registered in some of the jallikattu events this year leading to chaos after the event as it leaves many bull owners angry.

Police too have a tough time dispersing the crowd using force to make the bull owners leave the jallikattu venue. To avoid such a situation, members of Animal Welfare Board of India who are part of the committee to monitor jallikattu event represented to the district collector S Sivarasu on this issue.

A meeting was held at Srirangam by revenue officials with the organisers of the jallikattu to be held at Manjampatti of Trichy where district officials asked the organisers to refrain from issuing token to more than 600 bulls. This was following an instruction from the collector based on the request from the members of the committee monitoring jallikattu event.

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed the curative petition of Akshay Thakur , one of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape-and-murder case. It had earlier dismissed the curative pleas of two other convicts, Vinay Sharma and Mukesh Singh. Only Pawan Gupta has so far not filed a similar plea.

“We have gone through the curative petitions and the relevant documents. In our opinion, no case is made out within the parameters indicated in the decision of this court in Rupa Ashok Hurra vs Ashok Hurra & Another, reported in 2002 (4) SCC 388. Hence, the curative petitions are dismissed,” a bench of Justices N V Ramana, Arun Mishra, R F Nariman, R Banumathi and Ashok Bhushan said.

The court dismissed Thakur’s plea seeking open court hearing on his petition and passed the order after examining the plea in chamber.

The court had on Wednesday rejected Singh’s plea challenging the President’s declining his mercy plea and said there was no illegality in the decision. With the dismissal of his plea, Singh has now exhausted all legal remedies to avoid execution of his death sentence.

The trial court on January 17 issued death warrants for the second time for the execution of all four convicts in the case — Singh (32), Gupta (25), Sharma (26) and Thakur (31) — in Tihar Jail at 6 am on February 1. Earlier, on January 7, the court had fixed January 22 as the hanging date.

Divers from the disaster management group at the Chowbhaga canal

KOLKATA: A car, which was speeding on Basanti Highway, drove straight into a canal at Chowbhaga on Wednesday afternoon. The driver of the vehicle could not be traced till late at night, though all the other occupants of the car escaped unhurt.

Divers from the disaster management group searched the water for the driver, Sonu from Tiljala, but could not find him anywhere. Though cops from the Pragati Maidan police station suspect he must have fled after the incident, locals said they had seen a youth being swept away towards east. “The youth had raised his hand for help,” said Sk Nizamuddin, a farmer. The villagers reportedly did try to save him and ran along the bank but lost track of him.

Md Alam (18) of Tiljala’s Chhappan area and Anam Parveen and Reshma Khatoon from Tangra were returning from a relative’s place and the driver was reportedly speeding. Sonu reportedly lost control and swerved right but the vehicle fell into the canal.

BENGALURU : Kumara Krupa hotel, located behind the heritage structure of Kumara Krupa guesthouse, is giving star hotels in the vicinity a run for their money. Launched a year ago, the hotel has become a “favoured” property for bureaucrats, government employees and politicians who visit Bengaluru.The hotel boasts rooms which rival ones in star hotels and comes loaded with amenities including Wi-Fi and parking space. Located right in the centre of the city, rooms cost as little as Rs 400 per head, which has given the hotel a unique selling point (USP).Managed by Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation ( KSTDC ), the hotel has 180 rooms — 150 executive and 30 deluxe — and is run on a “no profit, no gain” basis by the state-run corporation.Officials say when the hotel was launched in January last year occupancy was a mere 10%. Now, on any given day, occupancy is at 50%. The hotel is open for common people, but at double the tariff rates as those set for government officials. “Effectively, 90 of the 180 rooms are always full on any given day,” said KSTDC managing director Kumar Pushkar.Officials say the hotel has become so popular that star hotels in the vicinity have approached the government, urging it to increase prices to give them a “fighting chance” of attracting government clientele.Still, DPAR officials say the government is flooded with requests from states to “reduce” rates to help their officials stay in Karnataka within their allocated travel and daily allowances. However, KSTDC says the government has no room to lower rates further.“In fact, maintenance costs are higher than the tariffs prescribed. All the revenue generated goes to the government and the expenditure too is reimbursed by the government. We only get 10% as service charge for maintenance,” said Pushkar, adding room rates are fixed by DPAR for different categories of government officials.The tourism development corporation is expected to take over management of other government guesthouses, including Karnataka Bhavan in New Delhi.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73758521,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-220503,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/kumara-krupa-hotels-nominal-rates-leaves-star-facilities-gasping/articleshow/73744714.cms

The Jadavpur house where the girl lived

KOLKATA: A 17-year-old girl committed suicide at Jadavpur on Tuesday night. Cops have ruled out foul play in the death of the teenager.

Alonkrita Dasgupta, a Class XI student of Nava Nalanda School and a resident of E block in Jadavpur’s Bapuji Nagar, had a tiff with her mother and elder sister over buying a new blouse for her Saraswati Puja.

“Around 8.45pm, we rushed to the house after being alerted by her family. We found the girl lying unconscious on bed. We noticed some discontinuous ligature mark on her neck,” said DC (Jadavpur) Sudip Sarkar.

According to police, the girl had locked herself in a room after the argument with her mother and elder sister. After some time her family members knocked on the door repeatedly, but there was no response.

They broke open the door and found that she was hanging from a ceiling fan with a cloth. “When her family members brought her down, there was no sign of life in her. No suicide note was found. We have seized the ligature. She was declared dead when she was taken to M R Bangur Hospital,” said a senior police officer.

Sharjeel was produced before chief metropolitan magistrate Purushottam Pathak at his residence in Saket on Wed... Read More

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police on Wednesday got the custody of JNU PhD scholar Sharjeel Imam , arrested on alleged sedition charges, for five days after he was brought to the city on a transit remand and produced before a magistrate at Saket. The UP police may seek his custody after Delhi Police interrogates him at length, a source said.

The cops initially planned to produce Sharjeel at the Patiala house courts. But the situation turned tense as some lawyers raised slogans against Sharjeel and held posters calling him a “traitor”. They also demanded that Sharjeel be hanged. Police finally decided to produce him before chief metropolitan magistrate Purushottam Pathak at his residence in Saket.

A joint team of Delhi and Bihar police on Tuesday arrested Sharjeel from Bihar’s Jehanabad district. Sharjeel, against whom cases have been filed in five states, will be probed for his alleged role in inciting violence at Delhi Gate, Jamia Millia and Seelampur with a speech he delivered at Jamia on December 13. He will also be questioned about his speech at Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh on December 16.

In an FIR on January 25, Delhi Police mentioned that in the December 13 speech, Sharjeel was seen instigating the crowd against the policies adopted by the successive Indian governments. He had allegedly claimed that Muslims were being forcefully sent to the neighbouring countries on different pretexts by various government agencies.

Later, the FIR mentioned, he was seen asking youths to do something that would “light the fire among Muslims” and claimed to be the “spark that would light the fire”. Police claimed a crowd had gathered to listen to the speech and two days after it, violence erupted. A police source claimed that some people arrested after the Jamia violence had said they were inspired by his speech.

While registering the FIR, the cops took note of the speech in Aligarh where he had reportedly spoken about cutting off the Northeast from the rest of India at the “chicken’s neck” near Siliguri.

Police will also probe Sharjeel’s association with organisations like Popular Front of India, suspected of fuelling trouble during the Citizenship Amendment Act protests.

In the meantime, the JNU Teachers’ Front (JNUTF), a splinter group of the JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA), has criticised the teachers’ body for coming out in Sharjeel’s support. “The support shown by JNUTA (on January 28) towards the person accused of ‘sedition’ tantamounts to providing support to ‘anti-national’ and anarchic elements of society,” JNUTF said.

The core committee of JNUTF, which broke away from JNUTA last year, also claimed that the majority of JNU teachers didn’t endorse JNUTA’s statement.

Reacting to the statement, JNUTA president D K Lobiyal said, “We have maintained that what the student said doesn’t warrant sedition charges. We are against the manner in which laws like these are enforced and that is what we said in our statement.”

Bhopal: For the city’s Raja Bhoj airport, 2019 proved to be a year of achievements with a significant rise in footfalls as well as flight movement. According to the December survey released by the DGCA, 1.18 lakh passengers travelled from the airport, almost 7,000 more than November, with a growth of 65.2% as compared to December 2018. From July to December 2019, Bhopal airport secured 17th rank in the customer satisfaction index. Interestingly, Bhopal had the same rank in the January-June 2019 survey.

The December 2019 survey says that the airport recorded a footfall of 1,18,855 passengers, which is 46,927 higher than that of December 2018 when the footfall was 71,928 passengers. Thus, the airport recorded a growth of 65.2% growth as compared to December 2018.

From April to December 2019, the Bhopal airport recorded a growth of 84.2% with 10,43,688 footfalls, while in the same period last year, the footfall was 5,66,471.

Apart from footfall, the airport maintained a steady growth in flight movement.

VISAKHAPATNAM: A class 7 student of a private school is battling for life with 80 per cent burns after she was allegedly set ablaze by two youths at Rajam town in Srikakulam district on Tuesday. Though the incident happened on Tuesday, it came to light on Wednesday after the girl ’s uncle claimed that a student from the same private school might have been involved in the crime.

Police said the 14-year-old girl claimed that two unidentified youths set her ablaze after pouring petrol over her and fled from the spot while she was near her home on Tuesday evening. CCTV footage, however, shows that one of the youths was near a market in the town at 5 pm on Tuesday, around the same time when the incident is said to have happened.

It is also suspected that the girl may have staged a suicide attempt as she had previously been admonished by her teachers and mother. Deputy superintendent of police R Prasad said the girl had on Tuesday expressed an interest in a class 8 student and offered him a watch and chocolates, but was turned down. The boy then informed the principal of the school, stating that the girl was trying to impress him. The girl was then admonished by her teachers and her mother over the issue. She suffered burns the same day after going home.

The girl’s uncle has held the school management responsible for failing to resolve the differences between the two students.

Police said the girl’s parents are daily wage workers. While mother works at a petrol pump in Rajam town, her father takes up odd jobs to make a living. “We are collecting the versions of classmates, friends, teachers and other persons to get some concrete clues in the case. We are also examining CCTV footage to identify the suspects,” the DSP said. Police are also investigating any family dispute angle.

Meanwhile, members of the legal fraternity visited the hospital on Wednesday to record the girl’s statement.

355,['30/01/2020'],Citizens gear up to wage another green war,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Nagpur: For the third time in a row, citizens have come together to oppose destruction of green cover for developmental projects in the city. Following the public announcement regarding chopping down of 139 trees for Smart City Project roads, people from different fields submitted objection letters to the civic body.

TOI recently reported that Smart City Project special purpose vehicle Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) sought permission to cut 139 fully grown trees in different areas of East Nagpur. Following the report, greens started circulating messages on social media, appealing citizens to submit objecting letters with the garden department of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC).

Strongly condemning the move in his letter, advocate Jayesh Ujawane stated: “I strongly object the cutting of trees by government agencies under the garb of development. A large number of citizens are concerned about deforestation happening in Nagpur and our objections should be taken in consideration.”

Members of NGO Green Vigil Foundation have requested NMC to reconsider the proposal of cutting over 100 fully-grown trees. “The green cover of our city is decreasing at an alarming rate and hence we strongly object further axing of trees. NMC should come out with a sustainable approach,” their letter stated.

As per the public notice published in a local newspaper, the highest number of trees — 68 — are proposed to be cut at the road stretch between Saduru factory in Naveen Nagar to Bhavani hospital in Pardi. Apart from this, 33 trees will be cut at Bharatwada road, 29 at the stretch between Bhandara national highway to Punapur road, 6 trees at Bharatwada road to Navkanya Nagar and 3 trees at the approach road of Navkanya Nagar.

Citing the latest study done by the Indian Space Research Organization ’s (ISRO) Regional Remote Sensing Centre (RRSC), honorary wildlife warden of Nagpur Jaydeep Das wrote, “Despite the report, the authorities are hell bent on cutting trees in the name of different projects. The areas of East Nagpur need re-planning as they have very less green cover left. The authorities need to find an alternative.”

Green activists have demanded a joint inspection of the proposed road stretches. In January 2016, the tree committee of NMC had saved 42 age-old trees on the stretch of road from Maharajbagh to University Library Square after a joint survey was conducted. “Similar inspection is needed in this case too,” said activists.

They further demanded the mandatory public hearing based on their objections. Earlier, thousands of objection letters were filed to save cutting of trees at Bharat Van and Empress Van but NMC did not hold a meeting.

Chaudhary claimed he went to request protesters to open at least one lane for ambulances.

NEW DELHI: Mohammad Luqman Chaudhary, the man who had entered the protest site at Shaheen Bagh with a pistol on Tuesday, said that he had gone there to request the protesters to open at least one lane to allow ambulances and school buses to pass since children have to appear for examinations next month.

Even though former Congress MLA Asif Muhammad Khan accused him of being an AAP member, Chaudhary denied being associated with any political party. He claimed he had mistakenly carried the pistol to the protest site. “I usually carry my licensed weapon when I’m out for work. One of the protesters noticed it and pulled it out and showed it to the others, after which all hell broke loose,” he added.

A member of the local Aman Committee, Chaudhary told TOI, “I and some responsible citizens of the area had gone to meet the protesters to tell them that schools will open next month and exams will begin. As children travel to Noida, a part of the road needs to be opened.”

Chaudhary said that he was a resident of Shaheen Bagh for the past 30 years and owned a realty brokerage shop in the area. “I had expected people to listen to me as I was known to most of them. However, they accused me of threatening them with a gun. I went there keeping the welfare of children in mind.”

DCP (Southeast) Chinmoy Biswal said that a case under IPC sections 336 (act endangering the life of another person) and 506 (criminal intimidation) has been registered against Chaudhary. He was detained and released after interrogation. The pistol he was carrying has a licence valid till 2022. Police might move for cancellation of the licence.

NEW DELHI: Responding to Ulfa (I) hardliner Paresh Baruah ’s insistence on making “sovereignty” the starting point of any peace dialogue, Assam finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Wednesday said the Centre would “certainly examine if a democratically elected government can discuss the topic”.

“There was positivity in Baruah’s statement. We have taken cognisance of it... More than the word ‘ sovereignty ’, the hopes and aspirations of the people of Assam will drive the peace process,” said Sarma. He pointed out that in 2005, the erstwhile UPA government had expressed its willingness to discuss all issues raised by Ulfa. While that didn’t translate into peace talks, the NDA government is committed to making a dialogue happen, Sarma said.

Jaipur: Former bureaucrat and activist Kannan Gopinathan on Wednesday slammed the ‘combination’ and ‘chronology’ of CAA , NPR and NRC stating that their implementation will increase intolerance in the country.

“CAA is against the Constitution and NRC is against the poor people of the country. There are millions of illiterate, tribal, poor people of the nation that will face the heat of this decision of Narendra Modi,” said Gopinathan.

Gopinathan, who quit IAS last year right after the abrogation of the special status for Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370, on Wednesday said that even after the move, there has been no difference in the situation in J&K.

“Amit Shah claimed in the Parliament that they will bring NRC and put illegal immigrants in detention camps. How will they determine who is an illegal immigrant – by the documents. First of all, they would need a detention camp as big as the state of Punjab as millions of people in this country will not be able to prove their citizenship through documents. Secondly, government does not have any planning on the people after being sent to the detention camp. They will stay in India after being thrown in the camps,” said Gopinathan.

He further criticised the implementation of the National Population Register (NPR) saying it will indirectly implement National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Gopinathan said, “Everyone says that this is being done to divert the minds of the people from unemployment and economic slowdown in the country, but no. This is BJP leaders’ core ideology and they have to be pushed back by the movement of the people.”

He requested the people of the nation to come forward and fight against the ‘fascist regime in the country.’ “We need to keep in mind what kind of country we want to leave for our future generations. If we won’t fight back, we will lose the ultimate fight for the Constitution,” said Gopinathan.

File photo used for representational purpose

BENGALURU: The eighth population census process along with the controversial National Population Register ( NPR ) will begin in Karnataka in April.

In the first phase, officials will take a census of houses — also known as house-listing phase — between April 15 and May 29. Revenue minister R Ashoka on Wednesday said all preparations are on and training for enumerators has already begun

Officials will visit houses twice — once for the house listing and again for the population census. The NPR exercise will be conducted during the first visit. BBMP commissioner BH Anil Kumar confirmed the exercise will go hand-in-hand with the population census that will begin later this year.

There is widespread opposition to NPR and the governments in West Bengal and Kerala have said they will not implement NPR. They are protesting against the Centre’s move to seek details of date and place of birth of both parents of a citizen. Congress-ruled states have also decided to avoid NPR, as it is alleged that it is being done to lay the ground for NRC.

Meanwhile, for the first time, house-listing process will go paperless with the Union government developing a mobile application for people to upload details of properties. Besides this, enumerators will also visit each household to collect data.

The population census in India, carried out once every 10 years, involves two phases — house-listing and population enumeration. In the house-listing phase, enumerators will identify buildings and structures, including residential and non-residential, and list them systematically. The population enumeration will be held next year.

Kanakapura MLA DK Shivakumar joined birthday celebrations of fellow Congress legislator Ajay Singh in Kalabura... Read More

BENGALURU: The government and the opposition Congress appear to have reached a ""peace pact"" over the issue of installing a statue of Jesus Christ atop Kapalabetta in Kanankapura taluk, Ramanagar district, putting the row on the backburner for now.

While Harobele Kapalabetta Development Trust has shelved work on the 114ft statue — it sent labourers on a break for Sankranti festival and work hasn’t resumed since — the government has decided to go slow on its decision to recover the 10 acres of land granted by the previous JD(S)-Congress coalition government to the trust.

""The government at present is not looking into the issue. There is no proposal to take back any land, at least for now,"" revenue minister R Ashoka told TOI.

The BJP appears to have instructed its rank and file to go slow on the issue, especially since it is grappling with the anti-CAA backlash.

""BJP functionaries appear to have realised that the issue could cost the party dearly on the political front,"" said S Gangadhar, president of Ramanagar district Congress unit. ""Having antagonised Muslims with the CAA controversy, ruffling the Christian community would have added to its discomfiture.""

When the issue erupted almost a month ago, the revenue department had asked the Ramanagara district administration to submit a report on the land granted to the trust and ongoing work related to the installation of the statue.

The Sangh Parivar alleged the land allotted to the trust was gomaala — reserved for cattle grazing. They claimed electricity and water supply connections were illegal. However, district officials admit they have not yet sent the report to the government. ""The report is still being prepared and we will submit it at an appropriate time,"" said MS Archana, deputy commissioner, Ramanagar district.

Meanwhile, Harobele Kapalabetta trust member Chinnaraju said the trust is in no hurry to resume work on the statue. ""Our cause is a noble one and we don’t want to rush it,"" he said. ""The government is looking at certain issues related to the project. We have furnished all the documents they wanted. We are prepared to wait.""

Reports suggest Kanakapura MLA and former minister DK Shivakumar of the Congress, who has patronised the project, has advised the trust to go slow in the interests of peace and harmony in the district.

""Initially, I guided the trust on how to legally get the land granted and even donated money to procure the land, but I have no role to play in it now,"" said Shivakumar.

However, the Sangh Parivar said it will continue with its fight till the government takes back the land.""There is no question of taking a backseat. It is not just about a piece of land, but a bigger issue of religious conversion. We will continue to fight and create awareness among people against the evils of conversion,"" said Hindutva ideologue Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat, who led a protest march in Kanakapura earlier this month against the Kapalabetta project.

HG Venkatesh, coordinator, Hindu Jagarana Vedike Ramanagara district unit, said the Sangh Parviar will hold protest rallies across district centres on February 15.

NEW DELHI: AAP has sought a 48-hour ban from campaigning on Union home minister Amit Shah and three BJP MPs for posting “fake videos and photos of Delhi government schools” on Twitter.A complaint was filed by AAP functionaries with the Election Commission on Wednesday seeking the lodging of an FIR against Shah and three parliamentarians. AAP claimed that “circulating fake videos of Delhi government schools by BJP leaders to defame Delhiites” amounted to violation of model code of conduct.In the complaint, AAP stated that BJP MPs Gautam Gambhir, Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma and Hans Raj Hans made “false, fabricated and concocted” videos to show a wrong picture of Delhi government schools to people. AAP urged EC to direct Shah and the BJP MPs to remove the videos from Twitter and direct police to register an FIR against them.A major flare-up was witnessed between AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal and Shah on Tuesday after seven BJP MPs, who had reportedly gone on a “surprise inspection” of Delhi government schools, found the institutions in a “miserable” condition. Releasing a collage of the videos, Shah claimed that the videos had “exposed” Kejriwal’s claims of “revolution in education”.Kejriwal had recently invited Shah to see for himself the changes in Delhi government schools after the home minister had repeatedly questioned AAP’s claims of educational reforms.Shah drew a sharp rebuttal from Kejriwal, who rubbished the claims saying that by sharing fake videos, the BJP MPs had disrespected 65,000 teachers, 32 lakh parents and 16 lakh students. “Out of the 1,024 government schools, BJP found only eight schools with some deficiencies. Even those turned out to be false,” Kejriwal said countering Shah’s charges on Tuesday.At a press conference, AAP said that BJP was completely baffled by Delhi’s education model. “This shows that in these elections, BJP is a party without any mission or vision. It’s difficult to imagine that the home minister would circulate fake videos and insult the entire education system of Delhi,” said AAP MP Sanjay Singh. He and party functionary Pankaj Gupta had lodged the complaint with the poll panel.Demanding that Shah apologise to students, parents and teachers, AAP said that BJP’s claims amounted to insulting all children of Delhi government schools who were working hard and showing better results than private institutions.Singh said that in the past five years, Delhi government schools had witnessed improvement in infrastructure and quality of education. “The home minister should go and see the swimming pools and the athletics grounds.

362,['30/01/2020'],"Set up exec capital away fromcoast, suggests GN Rao panel","This story is from January 30, 2020

Amaravati: The GN Rao committee report, considered the basis for the state government’s controversial three-capital cities model, has advocated keeping the Secretariat away from Visakhapatnam city. It, however, said the secretariat could be ideally located in Visakhapatnam Metro Region (VMR) area and away from the coast.

The state government had set up the expert panel headed by former IAS officer GN Rao to study development of capital city and decentralisation of development in all the three region of Andhra Pradesh. The state cabinet had accepted the committee’s recommendations. It had also sought a report from Boston Consultancy Group on equitable development. It later formed a high-power committee of ministers to study both reports and suggest measures on decentralisation of development. Based on the high-power panel report, the state government decided to move state secretariat, Raj Bhavan, chief minister’s office and all heads of departments offices to Visakhapatnam, leaving just state assembly in Amaravati, the present capital city. The high court was proposed to be moved to Kurnool.

A study of the GN Rao panel report, however, revealed that Visakhapatnam city is not the suitable place for state administration mainly due to ecological concerns and security issues. While the state government defended its decision on Visakhapatnam, the opposition took the government by the horns for not following the recommendations of the panel it formed.

Referring to Visakhapatnam, the committee felt that the port city is prone to cyclones and is ecologically fragile. After going through advantages and disadvantages of different cities in the state, the committee had recommended that the Secretariat should be located far away from Visakhapatnam coast.

It had also suggested that the administrative headquarters should be ideally located towards north of Visakhapatnam in Visakhapatnam Metro Region (VMR) and close to Vizianagaram district.

The contents of the report which saw light almost a month after the committee submitted it to the government, has generated a lot of heat in the state as TDP was quick to seize the opportunity to criticize the government’s plans to make Visakhapatnam as executive capital city. TDP alleged that chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy is planning to move to Visakhapatnam with an eye on usurping precious land. “Expert committees have clearly stated that Vizag is ecologically fragile area. Government did not even discuss the reports in the assembly. CM YS Jagan has ulterior motives in planning to shift the secretariat to Vizag,” said former minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu.

GN Rao, convener of the experts committee, defended his report. “The committee has many experts in their chosen fields. We studied various aspects and readied the report without any pressure from anyone,” Rao told reporters on Wednesday.

He said cyclones would hit all coastal districts and hence they suggested setting up the executive capital city away from the coast in Visakhapatnam.

He said the committee found that Visakhapatnam region was the best available option to locate some of the key government functions such as the Secretariat. The setting up of regional commissionerates, which would act as mini secretariats, would reduce the burden on the main Secretariat, he said.

He also found fault with the argument that the high court in Kurnool would only bring a few photocopying centres to Rayalaseema city. He said they have invited suggestions from farmers and people with open notifications as the committee could not go and meet all of them. He said several farmers from Amaravati had met the committee and submitted their representations.

363,['30/01/2020'],Traditional recipes from across India draws foodies at Lokrang,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Bhopal: The Lokrang Samaroh that began at the Ravindra Bhavan on the Republic Day features a number of dance-dramas, folk dances and songs along with an exhibition of handicrafts and paintings, but what is attracting people is the tribal food festival.

Food lovers of Bhopal had a blast relishing different delicacies from various regions of India, that ranged from traditional recipes of Arunchal Pradesh, Odisha, Sikkim and Tripura to the tribal cuisine of Bhil, Korku and Gond tribes of Madhya Pradesh.

Tribal chef, Suman Lepcha from Sikkim, shared his recipe of ‘Khuri’ (buckwheat pancake) with iskus nyak (squash saag) and spicy birupat (tomato chutney).

“We prepare the pancake with buckwheat and stuff it with green leafy vegetables like spinach or squash leaves, tomatoes and onions and serve it with spicy tomato chutney. People here are liking it very much and also coming for second helpings,” he said.

Foodies are savouring the taste of different states and falling in love with the diverse cuisines.

“I loved the Ladakhi momos and thukpa. They were extraordinary. I also had the gurgur chai (butter tea), which felt heavenly in this cold weather,” said Sonali Bhowmick, a student.

Bamboo chicken prepared by Assamese chefs is also a big hit among the foodies, who are enjoying the unique flavours of bamboo mixed with chicken.

“It is a very simple recipe. We marinate the chicken with garlic and ginger paste and grind it finely, adding salt. The paste is filled in the bamboo shoot and covered with a bamboo leaf cork and heated till it is cooked. The juices of bamboo shoot get mixed with the chicken and add flavor to it,” explained Pranav Jyotidas of the Assam food stall.

Members of the Santhali tribe from Odisha have also set up a stall serving the local delicacies of the state. Sunum peetha, Dombo, Handi, Letto and Jaeel peetha — both vegetarian and non-vegetarian recipes — offer something for everyone.

“Jaeel peetha is made with rice flour mixed with chicken. The paste is made into a chappati and served with dal and chutney. Handi is a hot beverage prepared with rice and powdered tree root fermented and heated in a pot or ‘handi’. The response has been very positive as people love the authentic cuisines,” said Robindranath Saren, a Santhali tribal chef.

Chefs from Arunachal Pradesh have also brought delicacies like momos, rice noodles, bamboo chutney and a banana flower chutney called ‘papuk’.

Bhil, Korku and Gond tribes are also serving dishes like makke ki roti, kadaknath chicken curry, fish curry, kutki pejo, jowar roti, rai bhaji, bamboo shoot curry, ratal curry and others.

364,['30/01/2020'],"Pune fifth most congested city globally, reveals traffic index","This story is from January 30, 2020

Punekars spend 59% additional travel time due to congestion, the index report stated

PUNE: The roads of Pune are the fifth most congested in the world, a traffic index report on over 400 cities revealed on Wednesday.

The report by location technology specialist TomTom detailed the traffic situation in 416 cities from 57 countries. It stated that India topped the global traffic index with four cities finding place in the Top 10 list. Bengaluru was ranked the most congested city in the world (71%), Mumbai fourth (65%) and New Delhi ((56%) eighth (See graphic).

The report stated that with 59% congestion, Punekars spent 8 days and an hour (193 hours) stuck in traffic while driving during peak hours in 2019. It revealed that the city’s heaviest congestion, at 93%, was recorded on August 2 last year. The lowest congestion (30%) was on October 27.

Elaborating the index, TomTom strategic business development manager Vinod Kumar P said, “It is both surprising and not surprising to see Pune among the Top 10 congested cities globally. Punekars are spending 59% additional travel time because of congestion. The index covers the length and breadth of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad.”

He said, “We gathered data from GPS, vehicle navigation dashboards and other such devices to understand real-time traffic and congestion. The reason for the congestion on August 2 last year was the heavy rain that considerably slowed down the city traffic. People took nearly twice the time taken to travel to a particular destination.”

Kumar P added that among the factors responsible for congestion in all the four Indian cities were the huge number of public vehicles on road, intermittent challenges posed by infrastructure work, climatic conditions and illegal parking.

TomTom India general manager Werner can Huyssteen said, “Globally, there’s a long road to travel until the congestion levels are brought under control. In time, the car-sharing services will help alleviate congestion. The planners and policymakers need to use all the available tools to analyze traffic levels and impacts and make critical infrastructure decisions.”

Prashant Inamdar of NGO PedestriansFIRST, said the seeds for the traffic congestion in Pune were sown in the 70s and 80s. He said, “Transit-oriented development planning can happen when the city is evolving. When Pune city was expanding and necessary planning started, public and non-motorized transport was neglected. In the 70s, the best European model for a city actually existed in Pune, where we had the culture of walking and cycling and a robust bus network.”

He added, “A good bus transport network is necessary. No other form of mass transport can provide a service like buses do. It is also a good feeder network for other forms of transport, such as Metro or the Railways.”

Sujit Patwardhan of civil society organization Parisar said, “The current situation was inevitable, if one is building more roads for personal transport and pursuing more flyovers and road widening. The policies to decongest roads are ironically congesting the thoroughfares by incentivising people to use personal vehicles. The general body of the Pune Municipal Corporation adopted a parking policy, but is yet to implement it.”

He added, “Metro is also not a solution, because the average trip length in the city is less than 10km. It is useful for people travelling longer distances, like Pune to Pimpri Chinchwad. Even in a city like London, twice the number of people travel on buses than the Underground. Bus-based public transport is the solution.”

Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagarik Manch said, “Public transport is totally neglected in the city and the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited is in a very bad shape. Metro will not solve the problem, as it is on select routes and serves a negligible percentage of the population.”

Bhopal: Amid growing concern over deadly coronavirus outbreak across the globe, including India, it seems the state health department officials are not bothered about the WHO protocol. They are busy discussing about ‘mild’ and ‘severe’ strain of coronavirus, even as emerging global threat Novel Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has claimed over 100 lives so far. Assuming that the suspected patient from Ujjain suffered only ‘mild’ infection, the officials only sent two specimens (swab sample and serum) to NIV Pune.

The Ujjain patient was declared negative for coronavirus virus on Wednesday, but the Union government’s National Centre of Disease Control (NCDC) deputy director Dr Suhas Dhandore later said that complete sampling guidelines should have been followed by the MP health department.

Thereafter, joint director (disease surveillance) Dr Rajesh Kathal said, “The Ujjain patient will be kept in quarantine for 28 days. I will ask the state surveillance officer for testing protocol received from the Union government.” He admitted that the patient’s blood samples is sent to NIV, if patient is considered critical.

“We do not know how the body is secreting the viruses. This is Novel virus. On the basis of information gathered so far, the WHO has recommended that body fluids need to be collected so that could we have correct information,” said NIV Pune scientist B and coronavirus nodal officer Dr Sumit Bhadwaj. Union ministry of health and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) adopted WHO guidelines for MERS-CoV includes testing of six specimens from suspected patients.

The specimens include swab sample, bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal aspirate, sputum sterile, tissue from biopsy (lung), serum (2 samples – acute and convalescent). CDC USA is also including stool sampling for suspected patients of coronavirus.

The state health department and Union government are not on the same page, when it comes to WHO protocols for testing of suspected coronavirus. MP health commissioner Prateek Hajela said, “The blood and swab samples of the suspected patient were sent to NIV Pune. We are following WHO protocols. No other samples are required. Biopsy is not required to be done on anybody, just because he has come from Wuhan, China.” He said the suspected patient is on the path of recovery.

AHMEDABAD: Students of the Bachelor of Urban Design (BUD) course at Cept University raised multiple issues with university authorities in a letter on Wednesday. The university authorities said that they are in touch with the students for quick resolution of these issues.

‘BUD batches of ’16 and ’17 pay more fees than the other undergraduate programmes on campus, Rs 2.14 lakh and Rs 2.05 lakh, respectively. Such high fees are discriminatory and unjustified,’ the memorandum to the authorities states.

The memorandum also says that the general body for BUD is unclear about the status of the affiliation of the course with the University Grants Commission (UGC). The body alleged that the BUD is not listed as a registered course under Cept University on the UGC website. ‘Regardless of whether the draft HECI Bill is passed in the near future, we cannot place our faith in a body that hasn’t even been formed officially by the government for the approval of our degree,’ the memorandum states.

The memorandum also states that more than 100 students got sick with dengue in 2019. ‘That should elucidate why such a congested space (of roughly 35mx12m) shared by 120 students is an issue… As a school of habitat design of the built environment, not studying in such an unhealthy and unhygienic environment with a lack of basic facilities is the least this student body can demand,’ the letter adds.

University registrar Anita Hirandani in an email said that the university fees are always announced before admissions are granted. ‘The university has made no changes to the fees announced to these students prior to admission and all students have taken admission after knowing the fee structure,’ she said. ‘We look forward to a quick resolution to ensure that their studies are not adversely affected.’

Chief secretary T M Vijay Bhaskar along with officials at Pachanady landfill in Mangaluru on Wednesday

MANGALURU: State chief secretary T M Vijay Bhaskar on Wednesday directed Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) authorities to scout for an alternative spot to dispose of the city’s solid waste from Pachchanady. The direction comes in wake of his visit to the Pachchanady landfill of the civic body, which Bhaskar noted was not technically suitable any more for continued dumping of waste, in the wake of problems it had caused in the recent past, especially in the monsoon.

Bhaskar, who earlier served as commissioner of BBMP, said waste management is a major problem, and it has now become imperative for MCC to search for alternative land for scientific disposal of its waste. Abandoned stone quarries are ideal for this purpose, he said, directing the officials to look for such land. Noting that such places are ideally away from human habitat, he said that they will be ideal places for disposal of solid waste.

Deputy commissioner Sindhu B Rupesh said nearly 8 lakh metric tonnes of waste slid down from the Pachchanady landfill during monsoon and entered human inhabited areas. The city corporation has made alternative arrangements for the affected families, she said. A high-level technical team that had visited the area, has reported that the design of the place is not suitable for dumping waste, and that waste should be disposed of through bio-mining.

Bhaskar later visited Mandara village which is below Pachchanady landfill, and saw first-hand the problems the sliding waste had caused. He assured the affected villagers that he would discuss with the district administration regarding compensating them adequately. Dr Y Bharath Shetty, Mangaluru City North MLA, said many people have lost all their possessions due to this incident, and it is important for the government to respond to their problems forthwith.

The state’s top bureaucrat later visited the Thumbe vented dam from where this coastal city sources its drinking water. Inspecting the water storage level, Bhaskar directed the city corporation and district administration to ensure its equitable distributing. Directing authorities to continue storing water at the present level of six metres, he said if the need arises, then water should be rationed and provided to people in a fair and scientific manner during summer.

BJP state president Chandrakant Patil

PUNE: BJP state president Chandrakant Patil on Wednesday announced Wadgaonsheri MLA Jagdish Mulik as the party’s city unit chief and accused the Shiv Sena, Congress and the NCP of joining hands irrespective of their ideologies.

“Their only agenda is to stop the BJP from being at the top. In the recent zilla parishad elections in the state, BJP bagged the highest number of seats. This is a clear indication that people are with the BJP,” Patil said while addressing a meeting of party workers to announce Mulik’s appointment.

Mulik replaced Madhuri Misal, who was made the city BJP chief four months before last year’s assembly elections. Patil appealed to Mulik and the party’s city unit to ensure a clear majority in the 2022 civic elections.

The BJP currently has over 100 corporators, including co-opted members, in the 162-member house. Patil said BJP was eyeing to strengthen the base in 23 municipal corporations, including Pune, which elected over 98 MLAs in the state assembly.

Mulik, who lost the 2019 assembly polls against NCP’s Sunil Tingre, said his plan was to take every party functionary into confidence and put up a united show for the 2022 civic elections.

Patil said, “Pune was led by Congress’ Suresh Kalmadi and NCP’s Pawars during the last two decades. BJP is now leading Pune and trying its best to ensure an overall development of the city, which is considered the fastest-growing city in Asia. The city is now also crucial in state politics with the highest number of assembly seats after Mumbai.”

He said, “The Maha Vikas Aghadi government has failed on many fronts and people are unhappy about many of its decisions. There is a complete chaos. The farmers have not received the loan waiver benefits. Most ministers in the cabinet either own sugar factories or industries. The government is taking decisions in their favour.”

On the recent demand for an inquiry into former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis ’s role in the Elgar Parishad case, Patil said, “We have no problem. But the inquiry should be conducted in a stipulated time… in a few days or a week.”

Ajmer/Kota: Muslim shop owners on Wednesday shut their shops in areas like the Dargah Bazaar, Langer Khana and Anderkot in Ajmer, against the bandh call against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). However, the effect of the bandh wasn’t visible in other parts of the city as shops remained open there.

373,['30/01/2020'],Panel proposes 5-15% hike in collector rate,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Bhopal: After evaluating property registrations over the course of one year in the state capital, a sub-committee of the district administration has recommended an increase of 5% to 15% collector rate at 54 locations across the city.

Collector rate is the minimum rate at which a property is registered. Last June, collector rate was hiked at 353 locations in Bhopal. Later, it was announced that next rate hike would not take place till 2020.

Sources informed that the new guidelines are currently being formulated; they will be effective from July 2020, if the recommendations are okayed.

District evaluation committee, which proposes raising of rates across the district, has begun its task. Final confirmation of proposed collector rate hike or reduction is, however, taken by the state government. Objections and suggestion for the same would be received by the district collectorate. “Increase from 5% to 15% has been sought on the basis of registries done in the these locations,” said a district administration official, requesting anonymity.

Committee is set to look into proposed rate increase at 54 locations in Bhopal.

Around 1,000 locations across the city are expected to witness a hike in its aftermath. As a general rule, increased collector rate also raises the value of residential and commercial properties in the vicinity.

District evaluation committee’s proposed hike is based on its analysis of properties registered in the areas in a financial year.

The district evaluation committee has zeroed in on locations where properties were registered at least 5% more than the prevailing collector rate.

But the final call will be taken once this proposed hike gets a green signal from the state government.

375,['30/01/2020'],Traders keep shutters down for a day to stand by anti-CAA protesters,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Kolkata: Several traders in central Kolkata observed a daylong token strike to protests against Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register for Citizens.

Shops in Bagri Market, Mehta Building, Canning Street, Armenian Street, Rabindra Sarani, Radha Bazar, Chandni and Lenin Sarani kept the shutters down throughout the day. Many of the shops had posters against CAA, NRC and NPR pasted on the shutters.

Several organisations including Bahujan Kranti Morcha, Versatile Minorities Forum and Joint Group for the Protection of Constitution had given a nationwide call for a daylong strike to oppose the CAA and NRC. The women protestors of Shaheen Bagh too had lent their support to the bandh call.

The sit-ins against the CAA and NRC at Park Circus and on Hogg Street near Chaplin Square registered one of the highest footfalls on Wednesday since the start of the protests with many people from different neighbourhoods joining in.

From campuses to the streets, there have been series of protests the CAA since it was passed in the parliament last month. Those who oppose it say it discriminates based on religion and grants citizenship to only non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Protestors have also been saying the CAA coupled with NRC can be used to target a specific section of the society.

“Shutting the shop means loss of income for one whole day. Given the gloomy business atmosphere, it is a big loss for us. But our backs have been pushed against the wall. People are protesting on the streets and women have been camping in several parts of the country opposing the CAA and NRC but the BJP government has not given any indications that they might want to review the citizenship law,” said Mohammad Tauquir, a plastic goods seller on Armenian Street which along with Canning street is bustling with business activities even on a Sunday. But on Wednesday, the lanes were empty and markets wore a deserted look.

Similar scenes played out in the shopping hub of Esplanade and Chowringhee where many shops were shut since morning.

Thousands thronged Park Circus and Hogg Street in the evening carrying the National Flag and raising anti-CAA slogans. “We did not open our shops and decided to come here to register our protest. In the coming days, we will be coming up with more innovative ways to protest peacefully,” said Sarfaraz Alam, a resident of Rifle Range Road.

Kolhapur: The shutdown called by various organisations against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register for Citizens (NRC) evoked a mixed response.

Bahujan Kranti Morcha, the forum of the organisations associated with the outfits of backward communities, had called for the nation-wide shutdown. The forum had requested even the traders and banks to observe the bandh on Wednesday. While many traders complied, the banks remained open.

In the morning, protest by the people opposing the CAA and NRC was held at Bindu Chowk. The protesters raised slogans against the central government, alleging that the government is planning to take away their citizenship through the CAA and NRC. The protesters were seen appealing to the traders to keep the shops closed and requested other protesters to observe the bandh peacefully.

The police administration had deployed security at most of the important places in the city.

Prakash Ambedkar, leader of the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) and grandson of Babasaheb Ambedkar, had given the call to observe the bandh in the state. He has claimed that 40% of the country’s population will be declared illegal if the CAA and NRC are implemented as many people do not have the documents to prove citizenship.

The areas that saw shutdown by the traders were Chhapal Line, Shahupuri and Rajarampuri. The shops were reopened after 2 pm.

Meanwhile, citizens were concerned about the closure of the banks starting from Friday. The banks are observing a shutdown for three days over pending demands. Bank employees, mostly belonging to public sector banks, are demanding revision of the wages for the past two years.

In nearby Sangli district, police nabbed the errant protestors. The police claimed that the protestors were forcing school rickshaws to stop operating. The police administration appealed to the protestors to observe the bandh and take out a protest march peacefully, but not force the shutdown on anyone. In Karad town in Satara, the bandh was successful with most of the shops remaining closed.

Jaisalmer: Members of several Hindu outfits have been staging protest for two days now, after the debris of some nineteenth century structures, that hold religious significance, were found at Basanpeer village in Jaisalmer district on Monday.

The agitators have lodged a case against four miscreants, who allegedly destroyed the chatris — considered holy structures by the Hindus in the area — and demanded that the four be arrested soon. People associated with several Hindu organisations have lodged a case at Sadar police station against the four persons — which includes two school teachers — under Section 285. However, no arrests have been made so far. Rashtriya Rajput Karni Sena Jaisalmer and Bajrang Dal, among others, have been agitating outside the collectorate, demanding for arrest of the four persons and the rebuilding of the chatris.

The chatris, said to be built in 1892, were built in memory of martyrs who laid down their lives in wars. SP Kiran Kung said inquiry in the matter so far has revealed that the structures were located opposite a school. According to school management, the chatris were damaged and crumbling, thus some of the teachers ordered their removal to prevent any mishaps.

CHANDIGARH: Jaypee group owner Manoj Gaur would hold a meeting with municipal corporation (MC) officers on handing over the Dadumajra garbage processing plant to the civic body and related issues here on February 1, in the latest development in the tussle between the two parties over running the plant.

“The meeting is fixed for Saturday at the MC office. Gaur and his team will pay us a visit. The meeting will be held under the chairmanship of mayor Rajbala Malik and municipal commissioner KK Yadav along with administrative and legal officers who have looking into the matter on a regular basis,” sources in the MC said.

An MC official said the plant has not been functioning properly even after the intervention of National Green Tribunal (NGT) and is unable to process the waste, leading to a drop in the city’s ranking in the Swachhta Sarvekshan.

“Since the company does not appear to be interested in running the plant in the current scenario and the MC too is not keen to work with it, we are looking for a permanent solution of handing over the plant to the civic body. The goal is that the plant is run to its full capacity and time is not wasted on legal and administrative issues,” said a senior officer of the MC

On Monday, Jaypee plant director Ranvijay had met MC officials, who outrightly rejected the company’s request to give tipping fee to it. The matter related to the functioning of the plant is before the NGT too.

The salvage value of the Dadumajra garbage processing plant will be the key in discussions on handing over the plant to the MC. The civic body is set to choose a third party for an independent financial evaluation of the plant. “If talks go well, the financial value of the plant will be decided by an independent agency after keeping all aspects like, land, machines and others in mind,” sources said.

379,['30/01/2020'],"Copies of techie’s Aadhaar, PAN forged to obtain credit card from bank","This story is from January 30, 2020

PUNE: Leaving behind copies of Aadhaar and PAN cards in a public sector bank proved costly for a 35-year-old software engineer from Pimple Saudagar .

An employee of the bank’s loan section and his accomplice used the documents to obtain a credit card in the techie’s name and made purchases worth Rs2.54 lakh, police said.

The techie received a shock when a bank’s recovery agent knocked on his door in October last year. After the fraud came to light, the techie filed an application with the cyber crime cell of the Pimpri Chinchwad police.

A team, led by senior inspector Sudhakar Kate, carried out a probe and arrested one Milind Sadanshiv (30) from Chinchwad on Tuesday. The bank employee is on the run, police said.

“Sadanshiv, is a friend of the bank employee and works in a telecommunication company. The probe revealed that Sadanshiv, too, had used the credit card,” Kate said.

A case in this regard has been registered with the Sangvi police. “We have handed over the suspect to the Sangvi police for further investigation,” he said.

Dnyaneshwar Sable, senior inspector, Sangvi police, told TOI that in February last year the techie submitted documents-linked to Aadhaar and PAN cards at the loan section of a public sector bank as he wanted a home loan “However, as the things did not work out, the techie dropped the idea of taking a loan. He did not bother to take back all his documents,” Sable said.

The suspect took advantage of it and applied for a credit card from the same bank with copies of the victim’s Aadhaar and PAN cards. However, he used someone else’s photograph on the form. “The suspect forged the techie’s signature on the credit card application form and managed to obtain the credit card,” Sable said.

He said that the bank employee and his friend Sadanshiv used the credit card at different stores and purchased clothes and other items. “When the credit card’s bill showed dues of Rs2.54 lakh, the recovery agent of the bank went to the techie’s house, following which he approached the cyber crime cell,” Sable said.

A team from the cyber crime cell checked the cellphone number and found that it was registered in the name of the bank employee. They also checked the CCTV footages from different shops, where the credit card was used and ascertained the identity of Sadanshiv.

“We arrested him from Chinchwad on Tuesday,” said an officer from the cyber crime cell.

The probe also revealed that the suspects had repaid some of the bill amount due to which the bank recovery agents did not approach them after the first few defaults, the officer said.

A video grab of members of 007 gang which went viral recently.

JODHPUR: A team of police officers from Jodhpur arrested a wanted criminal along with his two accomplices after an exchange of fire at a toll point in Maharashtra’s Kolhapur on Wednesday. Two of them sustained bullet injuries and have been undergoing treatment at a hospital in Kolhapur.

The kingpin of the 007 gang has been identified as Shyam Punia who carried a reward of Rs 40,000 on his head. He was wanted by police in many criminal cases.

SP (Jodhpur Rural) Rahul Barhat said that they would be taken to Jodhpur after they are discharged from the hospital. A special team was constituted to bust the gang which had constantly been after the gang members and its kingpin, he said.

“Team received the information that they were hiding in Hubli district in Karnataka. The team reached there and began a search operation with the local police,” said Barhat adding that the team spotted them in a car on Tuesday and asked them to surrender.

But they sped away while the police team started chasing them. After a chase of 200 kilometre, they entered Kolhapur district and were cornered at Kinni toll point where a team of Kolhapur police was also in position.

“Finding them cornered, they started firing at the police, upon which police also resorted to counter firing. Punia and an accomplice Shravan Bishnoi were injured in this firing. Both along with another accomplice Shri Ram Manju were arrested by the police and the injured were admitted to the police for treatment,” Barhat said.

He said that a case against them under various sections of IPC and Arms Act as well as Motor Vehicle Act has also been registered against them by Kolhapur police.

While Punia is among six most-wanted criminals of state, Manju is among 25 most-wanted criminals. Both are history-sheeters and have cases registered in various police stations of Jodhpur, Churu and Bikaner districts.

Before this, another active member of the gang, Sahiram Bishnoi had been arrested by Jodhpur commissionerate police in a cross firing in September last year.

The 007 gang had featured when a video had gone viral in August last year with the gang members dancing to a Bollywood number with guns in their hands.

According to police, the gang had become an emerging threat to the law and order in the desert areas in the crimes like attempt to murders, drug smuggling, loot, extortion, intimidation etc.

Naka checking on Bypass at night

KOLKATA: Police are set to reinforce a standard operating procedure ( SOP ) that they had created for bikers riding on Eastern Metropolitan Bypass following Tuesday morning’s accident, in which a pillion rider was killed near Arsalan restaurant opposite Fortis Hospital. Cops further said that they will continue with their night vigil even after midnight.

Investigations pointed to speeding that had led the victim Rosy D’Cruz, a BEd student from St Xavier’s College, to be flung into a canal after the bike hit a guardrail.

The police have been resorting to various measures to clamp down on rogue bikers. Though they have had to ease the crackdown a bit following pressures from various quarters, cops did not allow bikers a free run and conducted checks intermittently.

However, the accident on Tuesday has jolted the police as it happened at an hour when cop presence is least on the high-speed stretch. While the police are present till 1.30am to 2am, there is only a skeletal presence around 4.30am when the accident had happened.

“We have shut down slip roads and disallowed bikes from taking flyovers at night. But the accident took place on the main road at an odd hour. Some traffic guards developed an SOP for non-traffic hours (when cop presence is least) that will now be implemented on the Bypass. This will include three things – real time monitoring from control room when local police stations will be alerted about bikes breaking law; more guard rails that will cut down on speed; and clear signs ahead of accident prone zones,” said an officer from the planning section at Lalbazar.

Biker deaths have come down significantly from 82 in 2018 to 58 in 2019, thanks to the crackdowns at night. twenty of the victims did not wear helmets as compared to 50 in 2018.

“The campaign against errant bikers saw fewer accidents this winter. In the past three months, measures like impounding two-wheelers for traffic violations, including helmetless riding and triple riding worked out. But there have been space constraints to keep the impounded bikes. Besides, our regular checking to see the implementation of ‘No helmet, no petrol campaign’ has also worked out,” said a police officer.

Police might contact some “responsible riders” to make people aware of safe bike riding. “One should know traffic rules and abide by them,” said Shaheed Khan, a biker who has been awarded by Kolkata Police for following traffic rules.

A day ahead of resigning from the office, mayor Surmanjiri Latkar announced the final list of the 13 institutes who are eager to invest in developing various parts of the city. She said that over Rs 4 crore will be invested for ten years which will include the funds for development and maintenance.

A couple of years ago, the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) approved the policy for inviting the private firms to develop the open spaces, however, none had approached the KMC so far. Latkar, while taking the charge of mayor two months ago appealed to the private firms to approach the KMC without hesitation. Accordingly, for the first time, such amount will be invested.

Latkar said, “The public will benefit as they can use the amenities. Each firm has agreed to invest from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 80 lakh to develop and maintain the amenities. The firms will put their names on the display board in return for the investment they will make.”

The policy was applauded by the activists and the officials citing that the KMC cannot undertake the works owing to the lack of the funds

384,['30/01/2020'],Cops cane Udaipur anti-CAA protesters,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Udaipur: Stones, footwear, broken window panes were the remnants of the rally under the band call against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) which began peacefully but took an ugly turn at Delhi Gate, the busiest junction in the heart of the city on Wednesday afternoon.

Chaos hit the streets as people ran to escape when policemen resorted to lathicharge to disperse the protesters. Several civilians sustained head injuries while some had fractured hands and legs. Some innocent commuters too fell prey to the violence.

When asked for a comment, Master Bhanwarlal, minister in-charge of Udaipur, said he wasn’t aware of the incident and ""would look into it"".

The bandh call was made by Bahujan Kranti Morcha and supported by several other social organisations including Rashtriya Muslim Morcha, Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), Ambedkar Memorial Welfare Society, Bhim Army, Udaipur Muslim Youth, Jantantrik Jan Morcha etc.

While the protesters claimed they were carrying out a peaceful march and attacked brutally by police, authorities said the protesters had jammed roads, pelted stones and damaged public property. Cases have been lodged in different police stations while police has detained some of the protestors, sources informed.

“The protesters blocked road, damaged a shop at Delhi Gate when the shopkeeper refused to closed down on their demand. They got into scuffle with the additional SP and so our staff dispersed them by using mild force as reported to me by the ASP, city GopalSwaroop Mewara,” Udaipur SP KailashChandra Bishnoi told TOI. The officer said one constable is injured and admitted in the hospital.

Two cases one each from the constable and the shopkeeper has been taken. While the civil society and congress supporters condemned the lathi charge calling it arbitrary and 'coaxed by communal forces', the BJP supporters publicly applauded the incident on social media and hailed the police. Even some of the police officers commented on the social media terming the lathi charge as 'prasad vitran' after long time. Congress partymen said this is the third case in a year after the Piladar and Paduna incident, when police had exercised force on public.

“It is really an unfortunate incident. Police administration should not run amok in this manner. They should have handled the situation patiently and not resorted to lathicharge at the first instance. Many innocent people have been injured in the incident, the police behaved uncontrollably,” claimed Raghuvir Singh Meena, former MP and member of the congress working committee.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday found nothing wrong in the President’s decision to reject the mercy plea of Mukesh Singh, one of the four death row convicts in Nirbhaya case , who has now exhausted all legal remedies to prevent execution of the black warrant. However, the other three convicts in the case — Pawan Gupta, Vinay Sharma and Akshay Thakur — still have avenues left.On Wednesday, Sharma filed a mercy petition for commutation of his death sentence, saying the President should consider mitigating circumstances, including his physical and mental torture inside jail, while another convict Thakur moved the top court with a curative petition, the last recourse before a court of law. Thakur’s petition will be heard on Thursday.The apex court has already rejected the curative petition of Sharma. The fourth convict, Gupta, is yet to file a curative plea.A bench of Justices R Banumathi, Ashok Bhushan and A S Bopanna rejected the plea of Singh that the President was not supplied with all relevant documents pertaining to the case and that his mercy plea was decided without application of mind. After perusing the original files placed by home ministry, the bench said all documents were put before the President.The court said “quick consideration” of the plea does not suggest non-application of mind by the President. It added it is not necessary each and every material relied upon by the convict should have been placed before the President.It also refused to give credence to the allegation that his mercy plea was decided in undue haste and his sentence should be commuted in view of his alleged suffering in jail where he was physically and mentally tortured by inmates.“We do not find any ground for exercise of judicial review of the order of the President of India rejecting the petitioner’s mercy petition and this petition is liable to be dismissed. The writ petition is dismissed accordingly,” the court said.Though Singh has exhausted all legal remedy available to him but his death sentence cannot be executed until the other three convicts exhaust all options. As per Delhi jail manual, if the sentence of death has been passed on more than one person in the same case, and if an appeal or an application is made by or on behalf of only one or more but not all of them, the execution of the sentence shall be postponed in the case of all such convicts and not only in the case of the convict or convicts by whom, or on whose behalf, the appeal or the application is made. As of now, the four are scheduled to be hanged at 6am on February 1.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73751343,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-144240,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-no-illegality-in-rejecting-nirbhaya-case-mercy-plea/articleshow/73746914.cms

PUNE: The city’s airport ranked 61st in the fourth quarter (October-December) of the calendar year 2019 after bagging the 74th position in the third quarter survey conducted by the Airports Council International (ACI) on airport service quality (ASQ).

The facility’s rank in the third quarter was 74th in the category of best airport by size and sub-category of an airport with a passenger traffic of 5-15 million passengers in the Asia-Pacific region.

“I am not fully aware about how the rankings are allotted but as a frequent flyer I do face a lot of hassles. It is a small airport and overburdened, which results in passengers facing hardships,” working executive Pranav Sharma told TOI.

“The reason behind shifting the cab pickup point is still mysterious to me as many passengers got drenched while hailing a cab amid heavy rain during the last quarter,” he added.

The airport had started the first quarter of 2019 at the 63rd position, followed by a jump to the 53rd rank in the second quarter.

When it comes to the 33 parameters on which the rankings were decided in the fourth quarter, barring three areas, the airport’s performance had improved, the ACI survey revealed.

Aviation analyst and expert Dhairyashil Vandekar said a lot of things needed improvement despite the improvement in the airport’s ranking. “It is short on facilities. Late night flight delays prove to be a major issue for families. They airport needs to be managed in a better way,” he said.

Value for money for restaurant/eating facilities, availability of bank/ATMs/money changers and value for money for shopping services were the parameters in which the city airport scored in the negative.

A frequent flyer said, “The lone food court of the airport has closed down and the lounges available are very expensive. The other eateries are not sufficient as they don’t provide you with a wholesome meal. How can the airport record an improvement when there are complaints about lack of a food court almost everyday?”

390,['30/01/2020'],Kolkata: Indian scientist finds way to make gadgets smarter,"The breakthrough development has been published in the January 24 issue of the prestigious ‘Science’ journal.

KOLKATA: A scientist who took the Class XII board examination from his home, cleared IIT-JEE, did an integrated BS-MS degree from the Indian Institute of Science, Education & Research, Kolkata (IISER-K) and is now a senior scientist at Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research in Germany , has, along with the institute’s director, designed a microscope that can pave the way for light-wave electronics, which is millions of times faster than current-generation computers.The ultra-fast microscope, which Indian physicist Manish Garg and German physical chemist Klaus Kern have developed, can record extremely fast processes that take place in attoseconds. An attosecond is a billionth of one billionth of a second. “This microscope, a sort of HD camera for the quantum world, allows the precise tracking of electron movements down to the individual atom. It should provide useful insights when it comes to developing extremely fast and extremely small electronic components for computers or smartphones,” Garg explained.The breakthrough development has been published in the January 24 issue of the prestigious ‘Science’ journal.The processes taking place in the quantum world represent a challenge for even the most experienced physicists. Apart from the processes happening extremely quickly inside the increasingly powerful components of computers or smartphones, they also happen within a very confined space. When it comes to analyzing these processes and optimizing transistors, videos of the electrons would be of great benefit to physicists.“Earlier, an attosecond image delivered only a snapshot of an electron against what was essentially a blurred background. The new microscope that has been developed makes it possible for researchers to identify precisely where the filmed electron is located down to the individual atom,” said Garg.Filming electrons in molecules live, and on their natural spatial and temporal scale, is vital in order to understand chemical reactivity, and the conversion of light energy within charged particles, such as electrons or ions, explained Kern.With the new technique, physicists can now measure exactly where electrons are at a specific time down to the individual atom and to an accuracy of a few hundred attoseconds. This can be used in molecules that have had an electron catapulted out of them by a high-energy pulse of light, leading the remaining negative charge carriers to rearrange themselves and possibly causing the molecule to enter into a chemical reaction with another molecule.In present day computers, electrons oscillate at a frequency of a billion hertz. Using ultra-short light pulses, it may be possible to increase their frequency to a trillion hertz. With this turbo booster for light waves, researchers could clear the way for light-wave electronics.Garg, who was born in Barachh in Madhya Pradesh’s Shahdol, studied till Class X at Ramakrishna Vivekanand Vidyapith, Kapildhara in Bijuri, MP. The school was 16-km away from his home. Due to the absence of a higher secondary school nearby, he dropped out and appeared for Class XII as a private candidate.He then cleared the IIT-JEE in 2007 but opted for IISER-K to pursue his keen interest in basic sciences. Garg did his PhD at Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics in Munich from 2012 to 2017. After two years of post-doctoral research, he is currently a group leader (senior scientist) at Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research in Stuttgart.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73765511,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-802524,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/indian-scientist-finds-way-to-make-gadgets-smarter/articleshow/73745184.cms

Many usually bustling parts of the Walled City wore a deserted look on Wednesday

AHMEDABAD: Police put in place a tight bandobust in the Limbayat area of Surat after an incident of stone pelting was reported during the bandh called on Wednesday to protest the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Police sources said an SRP sub-inspector was injured after violence erupted in Limbayat. The bandh remained peaceful in other parts of the state. While the bandh was nearly complete in Mahuva town of Bhavnagar district, and the coastal towns of Una and Mangrol, business establishments in minority-dominated areas of Amreli, Savarkundla and Junagadh also downed shutters.

In Ahmedabad, the markets in Muslim-dominated areas, particularly the walled-city, remained shut, while markets were open in other parts of the city. The bandh effect was visible in Juhapura, Shah-e-Alam, Danilimda, Gomtipur, Bapunagar and in the walled city. In Shah-e-Alam, where violence had erupted during the bandh called on December 19, dispensaries and pharmacies also remained shut. However, no untoward incident was reported in the city.

After their failure to contain the violence, particularly in Shah-e-Alam, during the protests on December 19, the administration was on high alert and extra deployments of forces were made in certain areas. “Apart from 20 companies of the State Reserve Police that we have in the city, two more companies have been deployed. One company of RAF (Rapid Action Force) was posted in vulnerable areas,” said Ashish Bhatia, the city police commissioner.

During the day, Rakhial police booked about 50 persons for violating Section 144 of the CrPC, which prohibits the assembly of more than four persons at a place. The FIR stated that people had gathered at Morarji Chowk and were shouting slogans against the new citizenship law. The complaint also stated that as the police approached, the crowd dispersed.

The protest was limited to a shutdown of markets and people did not come out on streets to protest except in Rakhial. Shamshadkhan Pathan of Alpsankhyak Adhikar Manch, who had given the bandh call of December 19, said, “The bandh today was peaceful and people voluntarily joined in by keeping their businesses shut. The bandh was not enforced by any group. Those who were opposed to the idea of a bandh during the last protest also extended their support for today’s bandh.”

Local Congress MLA, Gyasuddin Shaikh, had been appealing to people to protest peacefully in a Gandhian manner, with the assertion that protest is a basic right of the people in a democracy.

Kolhapur: All three ministers from the district are going to attend the Lokshahi Din every month.

Ministers Satej Patil, Hasan Mushrif and Rajendra Patil-Yadravkar are going to attend the Lokshahi Din to be held on February 3. So far, only the officials under district collector would interact with the citizens on Lokshahi Din. The people raise their grievances related to government schemes and their problems.

The complaints vary and are related to various government departments. The work of the government, semi-government bodies and municipal corporations is covered in Lokshahi Din. The officials are bound to solve the concerns of the people in a time-bound manner. However, many times, if the concerns are not resolved, people approach to the public representatives and the ministers.

Rural development minister Hasan Mushrif said, “We all three ministers from the district have decided to remain present in Lokshahi Din together. We will meet the people from 11am to 2pm. I have asked all the officials to attend the initiative. I appeal to the citizens to come up with the written petitions addressing a particular department.”

He added that they would consult the officials concerned immediately and resolve the matter. Before the next Lokshahi Din, it will be made mandatory for officials to provide a report of number of grievances resolved, number of grievances remained unresolved and the reasons for not solving the grievances.

“A time frame will be allotted to the departments to resolve the grievances and the priority of the grievances will be fixed. This initiative will help reduce the petitions pending and submitted repeatedly by the citizens,” he said.

Mushrif claimed that the initiative will cut down frequent trips made by the people to the government offices. Mushrif also said that a common office of all three ministers will be set up at the old government circuit house in Tarabai Park.

“Those who are not able to attend the Lokshahi Din can submit their grievances at the common office and the secretary to be appointed will take up the issue immediately to the minister concerned,” he said.

Kota: Rajasthan DGP Bhupendra Singh on Wednesday terminated an inspector and a sub-inspector, posted in Kota from state police services and demoted an assistant sub-inspector to post of head constable, after verification of charges against them in an inquiry.

On the order by the DGP, circle in charge (CI) Jodharam Gurjar and sub-inspector (SI) Suryaveer Singh Malik have been terminated from the services, and assistant sub-inspector Ajit Moga has been demoted to the post of head constable, SP city Deepak Bhargava told TOI on Wednesday evening. “I am not aware of the reason behind termination and demotion of the cops but there were cases against them. Jodharam was booked for bribery, while Suryaveer had property offences against him,” Bhargava said.

However, press release from state police headquarters confirmed the reason of termination of inspector Jodharam Gurjar from services and stated that Jodharam Gurjar had developed ties with gangster Ranveer Singh and others during his suspension from June, 2014 to January 15, 2020 and had left his headquarters Udaipur police line during suspension.”

“In view of his ties and involvement in criminal activities, the decision has been taken to dismiss suspended inspector Jodharam Gurjar from the services,” the press release stated.

Names of the terminated and demoted cops along with some other cops of Kota range, had earlier this month surfaced as having ties with gangsters Ranveer Singh, who was shot dead last month in the city, and Shivraj Singh and their pictures of celebrating parties with gangsters in Goa as well as in Kota had also come to light on social media.

Kolhapur: No concrete plan for conservation of the heritage structure of Jayprabha Studio has been submitted for our consideration, members of Kolhapur Municipal Corporation’s City Heritage Committee said on Wednesday.

Vilas Yadav, who holds the power of attorney of singer Lata Mangeshkar, who owns the studio premises, has approached the KMC seeking permission to divide the land of the studio into two — one into an open site and another where the studio is located.

The total land under consideration is around 3.5 acres and half of it is proposed to be converted into open site. Once the land division takes place, the open site may be developed.

Uday Gaikwad, member of the heritage committee, said, “A rough proposal to conserve the studio structure was made a year ago, however there is no concrete proposal as of now before us to consider. As per the rules, the owner can utilise the open space near to the structure for private purpose.”

He added that there are some restrictions on constructing a new building on the studio premises such as it should not obstruct the vision and image, cause damage to the heritage structure or obstruct the skyline. “The land can be developed into the purpose for which it is marked in the development plan of the KMC. We had suggested to showcase the machines and tools used in the early days of movie-making at the site so that it will attract the tourists,” he said.

Deputy town planner Narayan Bhosale has stated that several policy decisions concerning the use of the heritage site and its premises have been made especially pertaining to Jayprabha studio and Shalini Studio. Non-film activities are banned at the site. Bhosale said that a comprehensive report has been tabled before civic chief Mallinath Kalshetti to consider.

Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the corporators demanded that no development should take place on the site of Jayprabha Studio and the heritage site should be kept intact. The corporators also claimed that if the proposal to develop the open space is presented to the standing committee for approval, they will oppose it tooth and nail.

Responding to their stance, the civic officials said that the civic body has three options to tackle the proposal. One is to pay Rs 21 crore to the owner to buy the land, second is to provide alternate land to the owner or grant the transfer development rights (TDR) to the developer.

The official claimed that the corporators have to take the decision on which option to be opted finally, however as per the rules, the owner cannot be denied the right to utilise the land or get the compensation of it.

The corporators are likely to agree to grant TDR for the land. The TDR means making available a certain amount of additional built-up available to the developer or the owner in lieu of the area relinquished or surrendered by him or her to the KMC.

Ready to sail: Interceptor boat C448 of Coast Guard, which was commissioned in Mangaluru on Wednesday

Mangaluru: The move by the Indian Coast Guard to set up a Coast Guard Academy in this coastal city received a major fillip with the state government handing over 160 acres for the project at Kenjar in Mangaluru taluk.

The land in possession of Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board has been allocated to the Indian Coast Guard to set up the academy, T M Vijay Bhaskar, chief secretary, government of Karnataka, announced on Wednesday.

Commissioning Indian Coast Guard interceptor boat C-448 here, Bhaskar lauded the role that the Indian Coast Guard has played since its inception, and hoped the proposed academy will emerge as a premier training institute for this uniformed service. “I hope the academy will produce a fine set of officers,” Bhaskar said. The academy that was initially proposed to be set up in Kerala has since been shifted, and will be set up in Karnataka.

Stressing on the need to revamp the coastal security apparatus, Bhaskar said it is imperative for the Coast Guard to have quick intervention capabilities to meet any emergent maritime situation. Coast Guard deals with anti-smuggling, piracy operations, aids fishermen in distress and takes care of the environment, he said.

Inspector-general Anand Prakash Badola, commander, Coast Guard region (west) said this maritime force set up in 1977 now has 145 ships and 62 aircraft.

399,['30/01/2020'],Patient at PGI tested negative for coronavirus,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Chandigarh: The patient admitted to the PGI on January 27 for suspected novel coronavirus (nCoV) has tested negative for the strain. This was confirmed by the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, through a report that was received by the PGI authorities on Wednesday. The patient will be discharged after three days of hospitalization in the communicable disease isolation ward at the PGI .

“The patient will be discharged today. We had sent his throat swabs and blood samples for the H1N1 and nCoV tests. None of them have been found to be positive,” said Dr Vikas Suri from the department of internal medicine, PGI.

The 28-year-old patient was admitted with fever and some nCoV-like symptoms after he came back from China recently. As per the protocol, he was admitted to the PGI as he had recurrent fever three days after his return from China where the outbreak has originated.

The family members of the patient were also quarantined at home. He is the only such patient admitted in a city hospital so far. Those who had a travel history to China recently had been asked to stay at home as they had shown no symptoms.

A press statement issued from the PGI stated that the patient was stable and was likely to be discharged soon. The throat swab and blood sample were sent to Pune on January 27. The patient had come to the emergency and when he informed the authorities about his travel, he was immediately admitted to the communicable disease isolation ward. The doctors at the PGI had also traced his contacts not to risk the transmission as he was suspected to have contracted nCoV.

Till date, this is the only sample sent to NIV Pune from Chandigarh, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. “As the virus strain is new, there will be many cases. The same happened with H1N1 when it made inroads in the country and now its mortality and prevalence has been declining,” said Dr Suri.

The doctors added that as the virus appeared to be novel, the information on seasonality and virulence was still not clearly known.

PUNE: People living in or around Pune cantonment limits will have to pay extra on transportation while traveling in private commercial vehicles like cabs following a 60-100% hike in the Vehicle Entry Tax with effect from Tuesday.“Cab transportation will be costlier as respective service providers will include the increased rates in their fare. Ultimately, people will have to bear the extra cost on transportation,” said Kishor Raskar, a software professional from Magarpatta city in Hadapsar.Traders, shopkeepers and other businessmen will also have to bear the brunt because the vehicle entry tax (VET) for goods carriers has been doubled. “The market situation is currently weak. We shall now have to pay extra money on transportation. It would be a tough situation for many traders and shopkeepers in Pune cantonment areas,” said a member of the Pune Camp Traders’ Association.The upward revision of VET has been in the range of 60-100% for different commercial vehicles.The PCB’s chief executive officer, Amit Kumar, told TOI, “The board had last revised and implemented the VET rates in 2010. Thereafter, it had revised the VET rates in 2013-14, but could not implement it because of administrative reasons. Now, we are implementing the same rates approved in the board meeting in 2013-14.”He said, “The board is entitled to revise the VET every five years. The next revision will be done in 2025, if needed.”The board had floated a tender as per the new rates and completed the statutory procedure. Currently, the board earns about Rs10.5 crore from VET each year.“This amount will increase to Rs15 crore annually. This additional revenue will provide financial relief to the board. It will be utilised for providing better civic facilities to the residents. Complaints related to misbehaviour by staffers at the VET collection booths will not be tolerated,” Kumar said.“We have categorically asked the appointed collection agency to abide by the terms and conditions put forth in the contract. Any complaint related to misbehaviour or excess charge will be treated seriously,” he said.After the implementation of the GST, cantonments across the country had stopped collecting VET. Delegations from many cantonments, including the PCB, had a special meeting with the ministry of defence and Director-General Defence Estates (DGDE) seeking permission to collect VET. On July 25, 2017, the finance ministry issued a notification allowing the cantonments to collect VET.The VET rate hike has not gone down well with activists and army officers. They stressed the board should explore other avenues for revenue generation.“The board has enhanced almost all taxes, but in return residents are not getting necessary civic facilities. The board must explore the revenue generation model and should be able to get its share of Goods and Services Tax (GST) from the government,” said Sanjay Kawde, a resident and activist from Ghorpadi.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73752995,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-509965,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cab-commuters-to-feel-pocket-pinch-in-pcb-limits/articleshow/73746805.cms

KOLHAPUR: The primary education department of the Kolhapur zilla parishad has claimed that as many as 1,977 schools in the district are tobacco-free.

In a press statement, the department said that there were total 11 criteria that needed to be fulfilled in order to be qualified for the tobacco-free campus tag.

The school education and sports department had explained the said criteria in its June 2019 directive. The Salam Mumbai foundation, an NGO which organises various programs in the district, has verified the campus premises after several visits, it added.

District collector Daulat Desai said that he had interacted with Salam Mumbai team members in November 2019 and it was decided to work on the tobacco-free campuses in the government-run schools.

District primary education officer Asha Ubale told TOI, “We often faced issues while uploading and complying with the problems via online mode. However, this time we had better co-ordination among school authorities and NGO members, following which the desired results are achieved.”

The press statement further said that out of its 1,977 schools, Shahuwadi taluka has 268 schools, Radhanagari taluka has 205 schools, and Chandgad has 199 schools, among others.

It has to be noted that the sale of tobacco products within a 100-yard radius of educational institutions is prohibited under Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act , 2003 (COTPA). The section (4) of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of advertisement and regulation of trade and commerce, production, supply and distribution) Act, 2003, prohibits smoking and the use of tobacco products in a radius of 100 yards near hospital buildings and educational institutions. It also states that tobacco products should not be sold to any person less than 18 years of age.

Ram Kumar, Padam, Mange, Sandeep, Joni and Rishi were also fined Rs 10,000 each. They were convicted under Sections 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) read with Section 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 302 (murder) read with section 149 and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.

A group of over a dozen people attacked the victims with swords and other sharp-edged weapons due to an old rivalry between the two groups, according to the police. Tension had prevailed in the village when the body was brought for last rites. Around 50 police personnel were deployed to prevent any further violence.

Drug addicts are mostly brought in by their family or NGOs.

MOHALI: As the data provided by the officials of the Mohali administration, it shows that none of the 7,141 registered DAPO’s (drug abuse prevention officer) admitted a single drug addict to the OOAT (outpatient opioid assisted treatment) centre since the launch of the programme in March 2018.

According to the data provided, a total of 1,172 drug addicts have been registered at the OOAT since May 2018.

Pooja, one of the three psychiatrists at the OOAT, which is in Sector 66, Mohali, said, “No DAPO has come to the centre with a drug addict. From now on, we will make sure to create separate data on how many drug addicts are brought in by the DAPOs.”

She said the drug addicts were mostly brought in by their family members as well as NGOs.

The DAPO project was launched with much fanfare by the Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on the Martyrdom Day of Shaheed Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev on March 23, 2018, at Khatkar Kalan in Punjab. The main aim of the programme was to engage the government employees and local citizens in fight against drug abuse.

Mohali DC Girish Dayalan said, “DAPOs don’t reveal their identity as nobody wants to tell that they got a drug addict to a rehab centre for treatment. Also, which drug addict is sent to which centre for treatment is also kept as a secret due to certain reasons.”

405,['30/01/2020'],"For love of Tulu, producers agree on film release dates","This story is from January 30, 2020

Mangaluru: With limited opportunities to reach out to their audience, Coastalwood for the first time chose to strike a balance in releasing films. With dates for release of ‘ Rahukala Guligekala ’ and ‘ English ’, two upcoming Tulu films clashing, producers held deliberations to ensure that the respective films were not released on April 3. This has not been the case in the past, where producers, often owing to personal egos, have released films on the same day.

Hailing this development, Jagannath Shetty Bala , journalist and former member, Karnataka Tulu Sahitya Academy, told TOI that producers have burnt their hands in the past by releasing films on the same day. “We saw this happen with ‘Appe Teacher’ and Thottilu and also with ‘Era Ullerge’ and ‘My Name Is Annappa’. The result of this simultaneous release of filmswas there for all to see,” Bala said.

Not wanting a repeat of the same, producers of ‘English’ and ‘Rahukala Guligekala’ decided to take the middle road and deliberate on the issue. While Harish Sherigar , a Dubai-based entrepreneur and producer of ‘English’ directed by K Sooraj Shetty, decided to release the film under the Acme Movies International Banner, he realised that ‘Rahukala Guligekala,’ that had received its censor certification, too was slated for release on the same day.

Informed of this development by his team here, Harish flew down to sort out the issue with makers of ‘Rahukala Guligekala’ that Jala Nidhi Films of Anil Raj and Lokesh Kumar had readied for release.

Harish and Anil Raj said both are investing in a Tulu film for love of the language and simultaneous release with limited screening opportunities will not be a suave economic move for either of them, and the latter agreed to defer their release.

Harish who has produced Kannada films ‘Yaana’, ‘Hottegaagi Genu Battegaagi’ and ‘March 22’ admitted that he had promoted the film before receiving censor film certification. “It is the magnanimity of Anil and Lokesh in giving up their dates,” he said, adding only when a film releases will a producer be able to get back his investment. Anil said he has temporarily suspended all promotion activities for ‘Rahukala Guligekala’.

Film to release again

‘Kudukana Madme’ produced under the GRK Production banner is set for a second innings in theatres. Released on January 3, the film had a two-week run in Jyothi and one week in multiplexes in the city. With lack of theatres being an impediment for Tulu films, we are now re-releasing the film on January 31 at Big Cinemas, Kalpana in Udupi, Radhika and Planet in Karkala, Amarashree in Moodbidri, Santhosh in Sullia and Mehboob in Kasaragod. – A V Jayaraj, director.

KOLHAPUR: The Kolhapur police nabbed three wanted criminals — who were fleeing Hubbali in Karnataka and trying to reach Pune — at the Kini toll plaza on Tuesday night after an encounter.

The arrested men have been identified as 24-year-old Shamlal Govardhanram Puniya, alias Bishnoi; Sriram Pacharam Bishnoi (22); and Sravankumar Manoharlal Manju (24). They are all members of the 007 Bishnoi gang and are from the Jodhpur district in Rajasthan.

During the encounter, one of the criminals fired three rounds at the police and police returned fire with six rounds which left two of the criminals were injured.

Superintendent of police Abhinav Deshmukh said, “The Jodhpur police had been looking for their (the criminals’) whereabouts in connection with several cases and had traced their location to Hubbali. When the Jodhpur police went to Hubbali, the trio moved towards Maharashtra and police started chasing them. When the Jodhpur police team got near the Maharashtra border on the Pune-Bengaluru national highway, they informed us about the criminals on the run. Based on the information, we set a trap at the Kini toll plaza.”

Explaining how the criminals were arrested, Deshmukh said: “At around 9.30 pm, our team reached Kini toll plaza and started nakabandi to search every car entering the area. Our team soon spotted a white car without a number plate waiting in the queue. The cops approached the car and identified the criminals based on the photos shared by the Jodhpur police. When the criminals were asked to get out of the car, one of them fired a round at our constable standing near the driver’s side. All the cops immediately crouched to take cover. The driver of the car then tried to speed up the car to flee but hit the divider instead. The three criminals then got out of the car and started firing at the police. In response, our officer fired six rounds. Two of the suspects got injured and fell on the ground. The police were then able to nab the trio.”

“The two injured men were taken to the Chhatrapati Pramila Raje (CPR) civil hospital. The bullets had hit one of them in the thigh and knee, and the other man was injured in the foot,” he said.

“We have recovered a revolver, two magazines, 10 live cartridges and five cellphones from them. They have been booked under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and several sections of the Arms Act,” he added.

DEHRADUN: With the aim to promote homestays on national and international level, the Uttarakhand government on Wednesday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with online travel portal MakeMyTrip. Uttarakhand has 2,100 homestays and this year, they intend to take the number up to 5,000.

The online travel company will provide training to homestay owners on hospitality, commercial activities, registration, inventory and tariff fixation, online review and rating, and on sustainable and responsible tourism.

Tourism secretary Dilip Jawalkar said, “By the next month, tourism department is going to conduct a survey of all the existing homestays and on basis of the facility provided by them and taking into consideration various other aspects, they would be rated. They would be rated under the categories of Platinum, Gold and Silver. This will help them in making the required upgrade and changes.”

The official pointed out that through the portal of the online travel company, the homestays of Uttarakhand would reach out to as many as 12 lakh people. “In addition to the homestays, it will also display the facilities provided to the people. The firm will also use other social media platforms to promote the homestays,” Jawalkar said.

On the commission charged by the online travel portal, Jawalkar said that the tariff would be fixed by the homestay owners. “The online travel firm will take 15% of the gross revenue as the commission and we have kept a provision that it cannot be increased for a period of three years. This will benefit the homestay owners,” the secretary added. In the tie up, the homestay owners will have the option to decide the tariff and in lean season they can bring down the rates as well.

At present, Uttarakhand has 2,100 homestays. “It is imperative for a person to stay in the house, which he intends to use as homestay. Therefore, one person can apply for one homestay only. If there are a cluster of five to six homestays in a village, the state government will help in developing the infrastructure,” Jawalkar said.

To boost homestays, the state government has decided to reimburse government officers and employees who stay in the homestays during their official visits. “The officers and employees would be required to show the bill for stay at homestays for reimbursement. We hope that this will give a further push to homestays in the state,” Jawalkar said.

Vehicle movement was restored in Uttarkashi on Wednesday.

DEHRADUN/MUSSOORIE/NAINITAL/UTTARKASHI: The higher reaches of Uttarakhand turned into a white blanket as heavy snowfall was witnessed in several hill districts of the Himalayan state in the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday.

Significantly, several hill stations such as Mussoorie, Dhanaulti, Tehri, Chakrata, Auli, Mukteshwar and Nainital reported good snow cover, causing cold day to severe cold day conditions across the Himalayan state.

Providing details, Bikram Singh, director of regional meteorological centre, said, “Several hilly places in Uttarakhand have witnessed good snowfall in the span of 24 hours since Tuesday evening. For instance, Mussoorie received nearly half feet snow while Chakrata and surrounding hills in Garhwal region, too, witnessed good snow activity.”

While the foothills, including Dehradun, received intermittent rainfall on Wednesday, the weather cleared up by afternoon. The Met office has predicted dry weather across Uttarkahand for the next five to six days.

Meanwhile, in Mussoorie, the snowfall that began around 4 am on Wednesday, lasted for around two hours.

A number of tourists from Dehradun and nearby areas rushed to the Queen of Hills to witness the snow. “It was a wonderful experience to watch so much snow,” said Rahul Kapoor, a tourist who had come to Mussoorie.

However, vehicles had to be stopped at Kincraig in the morning. Normal traffic resumed around noon after JCBs were used to clear the snow on Mussoorie-Dehradun road and on the Mall road. By the afternoon, roadways buses — that were not able to go beyond Kincraig in the morning — resumed normal functioning.

“More than 10 electric poles had been damaged due to uprooting of trees but we were able to restore power supply in all parts of the town by noon,” informed SDO Mussoorie Pankaj Thapliyal.

The hills of Kumaon, including places such as Nainital, Mukteshwar and Binsar, saw the season’s fifth snowfall on Wednesday. “The rains had started on Tuesday evening and continued till late night. However, rains soon gave way to heavy snowfall on Wednesday morning which continued till late afternoon,” said Surendra Kumar, a resident of Nainital.

“Snowfall started early in the morning on Wednesday in our town. Several other nearby areas also received a good amount of snowfall including Binsar,” Pradeep Dharamwal, a resident of Mukteshwar, told TOI.

In Nainital, almost all tourist attractions such as Kilbury, Snow View Point and the Mall Road were covered in snow. Meanwhile, several areas in the plains of Kumaon were lashed by rain. This included places such as Haldwani and Lalkuan in Nainital and Kichha in Udham Singh Nagar district .

Rain and snow, however, also brought lots of trouble for the local residents. Many people were stuck in their homes while almost all the secondary roads in Nainital were blocked. “I had to travel to Haldwani. However, the snow made the roads so slippery that I oouldn't get my car out. Though we tried to remove some of the snow with a shovel, it didn’t work,” said Naveen Sethi, a resident of Mallital.

Heavy snowfall and incessant rainfall also disrupted power supply in more than one hundred Uttarkashi villages and hindered traffic movement in nearly two dozen district roads, including Gangotri and Yamunotri national highways, stretches between Mori-Jakhol, Kuwan-Kafnol, Dharasu-Jogat, Aarakot-Chiwan, and Uttarkashi-Lambgaun, among others.

CHANDIGARH: Around 49% of those applying for driving licences for two-wheelers and four-wheelers failed to pass driving test on the new sensor-equipped automated test track at the Chandigarh Traffic Park (CTP) in Sector 23 here, shows an official data.According to the data compiled by the Registering and Licensing Authority (RLA) for the last six months, between July 1 and December 31, 2019, only 51% of those taking the test were able to make it in first attempt.Clearing the driving test has become more difficult ever since the introduction of automated test track designed by Central Institute of Road Transport (CIRT) in June 2017 by the Chandigarh RLA, where Innovative Driving Testing System (IDTS) — a camera-based driving skill assessment system — is used to assess a licence seeker.Giving details about the project, an RLA official said IDTS enables driving instructor/ motor vehicle inspector to test the driving skill of the applicant with lesser human intervention. The Chandigarh administration has deployed the IDTS-based system in Children Traffic Park, Sector 23-A, Chandigarh with the help of Pune-based CIRT. CIRT is a unit of the ministry of road transport and highways, and Association of State Road Transport Undertakings specializing in testing and certification of auto components and vehicles. The IDTS project in Chandigarh cost around Rs 2.2 crore, he added.The official said the length of IDTS track in the traffic park is 750 meter, approximately. There are 20 hi-tech cameras, along with 21 sensor pairs (RFID readers), installed by the CIRT on the test track. As the vehicle moves on the track, it plots and traces the path taken by the vehicle on the test track in real time on a two dimensional image display on a computer console. Around 140 applicants appear daily for the driving test at IDTS track in Chandigarh, he added.The new system is first of its kind in the entire region, which ensures a technology-oriented assessment of the driving quality of licence seekers. The format makes the test more rigorous, checking driving skills of the applicants with greater accuracy.As an applicant starts driving on the track, his or her performance gets recorded in the cameras installed along the track. Based on the performance, marks is given to the applicant automatically without any human interference. The system ensures that only people with sound knowledge of traffic rules and adequate training get the right to drive a vehicle.The automated track has seven different sub-tracks, including reverse track, U-turn track, wrong turn track, four-junction track, roundabout track and gradient track. Monitoring is done through an objective evaluation of the applicant’s driving skills and the result is out immediately after the test, giving details of the performance in a transparent manner.",chandigarh,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73753563,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-129805,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/49-applicants-fail-to-clear-driving-test/articleshow/73743684.cms

Congress MLAs block the way of governor Arif Mohammed Khan at Kerala Legislative Assembly in Thiruvananthapura... Read More

Thiruvananthapuram: Governor Arif Mohammed Khan was blocked by the Congress-led opposition members inside the assembly when he arrived to address the House on the first day of budget session. The opposition members were then forcibly removed by the watch and ward staff of the assembly.

The governor, accompanied by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, speaker P Sreeramakrishnan and parliamentary minister A K Balan, had to wait for a few minutes inside the well of the House as the opposition members blocked the passage.

As soon as the governor entered the House, the opposition members shouted “governor go back” and blocked the passage and prevented him from entering the dais of the speaker. Even though the speaker requested the members to go back to their seats and allow the governor to deliver his address, the opposition members were unrelenting.

The speaker then called the watch and wards of the House and asked them to remove the protesting opposition members. After removing them, the governor proceeded to the dais and began to address the House.

However, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala protested against the address by the governor. He wanted the speaker to discontinue it. But, the governor continued with his speech and later, the opposition members marched out of the House boycotting the speech.

Later, Chennithala said the chief minister and the governor had a “secret understanding” and the reasons behind this will come out when the SNC-Lavalin case comes before the Supreme Court next week.

“The governor is a bridge for the chief minister to appease the BJP since he wants the Centre’s support in the SNC-Lavalin case. The drama witnessed in the assembly was signalling to this unholy nexus between the chief minister and BJP,” said Chennithala.

There is a secret understanding between the governor and the chief minister and this was the reason why the governor agreed to read the controversial paragraph criticising the Centre for passing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

The governor has been insulting the state assembly ever since the unanimous resolution against the CAA was passed. However, the chief minister till date has not uttered a word against the governor. The notice to recall the governor should have been brought by the chief minister in the House, Chennithala said. “After the human chain organised by the LDF against the CAA, the chief minister went straight to the governor to plead before him to read the speech prepared by the cabinet,’’ said the opposition leader.

“The chief minister is not sincere in the fight against CAA. The opposition will not go back from its demand to recall the governor, who has insulted the state assembly, he added. The opposition members later staged a dharna before the assembly till the address made by the governor got over inside the House.

Guv, CM meet frequently, says Muraleedharan

Kottayam: Congress leader K Muraleedharan said on Wednesday that the governor, who had said he will not read about the resolution passed against CAA in his address to the assembly, read out the portion on the request of the chief minister. This shows that both the CM and the governor meet frequently, said Muraleedharan, adding that the CM had headed straight to Raj Bhavan to meet the governor soon after the human chain protest against CAA.

MOHALI: If one goes by the data provided by the officials, the registration of the drug abuse prevention officers (DAPO) has seen a decline of 95% in 2019 as compared to 2018.

According to the data, a total number of 6,790 volunteers came forward to curb drug menace in the district in 2018, when it was launched in March by Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh.

However, surprisingly, in 2019, where the numbers should have seen a hike, only 325 citizens came forward to register for the same.

Sources in the department revealed that DAPO officers are not participating as much as they should and hardly a few of them are active on field.

The source also added that it was going slow and enthusiasm among the citizens was low and most of the DAPOs were misusing identity cards.

The data also revealed that till January 23 this year, only 26 officers came forward to register for the same. Since the project has been launched, there are a total of 7,141 DAPOs in the Mohali district.

Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said, “The number count of the registration is not important, but how many drug addicts have been taken to the de-addiction centres for their betterment by these officers is important. I also keep a check on them twice a week and keep a tab on their work.”

The officials said the nodal officers appointed for the DAPO programme in the district are ADC Sakshi Sawhney and nodal officer appointed by the police is SP (H) Gursewak Singh Brar.

Drug abuse prevention officer (DAPO) is a voluntary officer who is supposed to raise awareness regarding drug abuse and identify users. It is his or her duty to spread the message against drug abuse in society irrespective of his or her allotted area.

The government has urged private establishments to do the same. “It is the social, moral and ethical duty of everyone to respect India’s Independence and remember how it was achieved,” says a notice issued by the general administration department on Wednesday.

The GAD issued detailed instructions for Martyr’s Day, saying sirens should be blown or a cannon fired to signal the beginning and end of the two-minute silence from 11am to 11.02am. The sirens can be blown at 10.59am and 11.03am, it says. As soon as they hear the siren, people should stand where they are and observe a two-minute silence, it says, suggesting that it is better done in groups.

The GAD has order all department heads and district collectors to arrange for sirens and motivate everyone to observe silence. District administrations have been told to ask private institutes, industrial establishments, employee unions and NGOs to follow suit. A bell can be used in place of siren in schools and colleges, it says.

“It has come to notice that when silence is observed in government establishments, general public remain busy in their routine work,” the GAD notice says, requesting people to give importance to Marty’s Day. Collectors have been told to sensitize public.

Institutions have been advised to run films, documentaries and organise exhibitions, highlighting the nation’s freedom struggle and national unity.

425,['30/01/2020'],Comic Kamra’s grounding stirs up a controversy,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Comedian Kunal Kamra (File photo)

NEW DELHI: A controversy has erupted over IndiGo, Air India, SpiceJet and GoAir deciding not to fly standup comedian Kunal Kamra after he confronted TV anchor Arnab Goswami on a Mumbai-Lucknow IndiGo flight Tuesday. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Wednesday reiterated “the action taken by airlines is in complete consonance with (rules) on handling of unruly passengers” and that the matter will be referred to an internal committee that will give its final decision in 30 days which shall be binding on IndiGo.

The DGCA's clarification came after HuffPost India carried an article quoting DGCA chief Arun Kumar as saying that the six-month ban by IndiGo and till-further-notice banning by others was a “clear violation of rules”. The HuffPost article said: “Kumar said that as per DGCA rules, in case of any unruly behaviour restricted to verbal confrontation, the airlines should first impose a temporary ban of 30 days on the passenger and conduct an internal enquiry headed by a retired judge into the incident.”

The DGCA clarification said “HUFFPOST has misquoted/misrepresented the facts as stated by the Director General of Civil Aviation.”

While unruly behaviour on flights is unacceptable, DGCA’s civil aviation requirement (CAR or rules) on “handling of unruly passengers” enacted in September 2017 clearly lay down the process for putting a person on the no-fly list and the duration for which that can be done. The idea is to prevent any misuse.

According to rules, the pilot-in-command of the flight on which the unruly behaviour takes place should start the process by referring the same to the airline that will then form an internal committee headed by a retired judge. This panel will need to decide within 30 days whether the person is guilty of unruly behaviour and if so, how long the no-fly period should be.

Pending a decision, only the airline concerned can bar the allegedly disruptive passenger from flying for a maximum of 30 days. In case the committee fails to take a decision in 30 days, the passenger will be free to fly.

A person put on no-fly list (NFL) by one airline can still travel with other carriers. Other Indian airlines are, however, free to bar the person for a similar period.

Going by the DGCA's rules, IndiGo could have grounded Kamra for 30 days. Once a decision was taken by it on Kamra’s guilt and grounding period within those 30 days, other airlines would have been free to follow suit.

Before these 2017 rules were notified, there was no formal framework for NFL. The instances of a Shiv Sena MP threatening to beat up an Air India staffer on board an aircraft with his slippers and then a TDP MP threatening airline staffers at an airport in Andhra had happened before these rules were enacted. Both times, the airline whose staff had been threatened had grounded the MP and all other Indian airlines had followed suit.

BHUBANESWAR: The BJD is hoping that the developments in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh , where the assembly has passed a resolution to abolish the Vidhan Parishad (legislative council), will not impact Odisha’s demand for an upper house.

The party also hopes that the Centre would bring a legislation in the forthcoming Parliament session, paving the way for a Vidhan Parishad in Odisha.

“The legislative council in Odisha is already on the anvil as far as the central government is concerned. The Centre has committed itself. The assembly has already passed a resolution on it. There is no party politics in it,” said Pinaki Mishra, the BJD leader in Lok Sabha .

Asked whether there was any concrete assurance from the Centre to bring a legislation in the forthcoming session, Mishra said, “I don’t like to discuss what has been discussed with the Centre, but definitely there is no opposition to bring the legislation.”

Asked as to why Odisha is pushing for it at a time when Andhra Pradesh has decided to abolish it, the senior BJD parliamentarian said he would not comment on it.

“You must be knowing well as to why Andhra Pradesh has decided to abolish it. Earlier also it was abolished and later reinstated. Andhra’s position is very peculiar. But it would not affect our demand for a legislative council,” Mishra added.

The Union cabinet has to approve the proposal of a legislative council before it is moved in Parliament. The state assembly had passed a resolution on September 6, 2018, for an upper house in Odisha even as members of Congress and BJP had staged a walkout.

He took obscene photographs of the girl and threatened to post them on social media if she spoke to anyone about the rape. He let her go on January 27, warning her to keep quiet.

Scared, the girl did not tell anyone about the sexual assault. But pictures of her tied up and being raped popped up on social media the very next day. Police got to know about rape photos being circulated and began investigating on their own. “After viral obscene pictures of the girl reached the Nawrojabad police station in-charge, police verified them found that the pictures are of a local girl,” Umaria additional SP Rekha Singh told TOI.

A case was registered, suo motu, and police traced the girl. “She narrated her ordeal when we reached out to her. The accused was arrested within a couple of hours and produced in court on January 28. He is now in jail,” said the ASP. Uike said police have seized his phone and made him delete the pictures from social media platforms and all other places where he had shared them.

Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court rallied for the environment yet again when on Wednesday it heard various matters related to trees. The bench, headed by justices Ravi Deshpande and Amit Borkar, directed the local tree authority to ensure that tree felling permissions are uploaded online.

Legal counsel for Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) Jemini Kasat said this was to ensure implementation of a government decision. “There was a government resolution regarding this and the tree authority has been asked to upload the permissions they give,” he said.

NMC is the authority in the city to give permission for tree felling. The other issue was related to the condition of trees near Ganesh Tekdi temple. Kasat said, “Concerns were raised about the condition of 8 to 10 trees in the vicinity. I visited the site after being directed to do so and found that one of the trees had fallen due to construction activity. Now, the tree authority has been directed to inspect the area and give a report.”

He added that the court had urged citizens to inform the HC about illegal tree felling, following which many letters regarding the same started pouring in.

Kasat said, “Another issue related to a concern raised about the government’s initiative of having every student plant a tree. Regarding this, a reply has been sought from the chief conservator of forest and three weeks’ time has been given.”

Representative image

KORAPUT: Five days after a Maoist was killed and another injured during a face-off between the rebels and villagers in Janturai, located inside the Swabhiman area of Malkangiri district , the CPI (Maoist) released an audio tape on Wednesday accusing the police and the administration of instigating the villagers.

A Maoist, identifying himself as Ganesh, secretary of the Andhra-Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee, sent an audio tape to a few mediapersons in Malkangiri, in which he alleged that police and administration are instigating villagers to turn against the Maoists.

“Police agents present in the crowd had attacked our party members. We are always with the villagers and will keep fighting for them,” the Maoist leader says in the audio recorded in Telugu.

But the police dismissed it saying the Maoists are levelling baseless allegations out of panic and frustration as they are loosing the villagers’ support.

“Police are in no way related to the incident. It was the Maoists who first attacked the villagers and they retaliated. It was a natural outburst from villagers against unreasonable demands of the Maoists,” SP (Malkangiri) Rishikesh Khilari said.

“The authenticity of the audio tape will be examined as it could be the handiwork of some miscreants,” the SP said.

According to the police, a video footage doing the rounds clearly shows the Maoists threatening villagers with explosives in their hands. It may be recalled that on the intervening night of January 25-26, a group of around 25-30 armed Maoists swooped down on Janturai village under Jodambo panchayat and assaulted the villagers on charges of supporting the administration in road work.

After a brief confrontation, the villagers attacked the Maoists with bows and arrows and pelted stones during which a Maoist was killed another injured. The next day, the Maoists torched 15 houses.

Saina Nehwal. (PTI file photo)

HYDERABAD: Star shuttler Saina Nehwal made a crucial move in her career, this time in a different field, when she joined the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in New Delhi on Wednesday.

The former world No.1, the only Indian woman to have achieved the feat, along with her elder sister, Abu Chandranshu, joined in the party in the presence of its general secretary and MP from UP, Arun Singh, and other leaders.

“It’s a great day today. I have won several titles for the country, and I am glad that I have joined the party that is working towards nation-building. I am thankful to BJP for giving me this honour and hope that I can do well for the country under PM Modi’s leadership,” Saina told the media in New Delhi.

Saina joining BJP did not come as a surprise for her colleagues and coaches at the academy. Ever since Amit Shah had met her in the city as part of BJP’s ‘Sampark for Samarthan’ programme in July 2018, talks had started doing the rounds that she would join the party.

It was also learnt that she has been trying to get nominated to the Rajya Sabha for the last few months.

Sportspersons like Mary Kom have been nominated to the upper house by the party.

However, what came as a surprise was the fact that Saina made this political move while she was busy trying hard to secure an Olympic qualification.

With the Olympic qualification period ending on April 29, Saina already has a task on her hands, as she must stay within the top-16 in the world rankings to qualify.

As of now, she is languishing at no.22 in the Olympic rankings and no.18 in the world rankings.

With eight more tournaments to be held before the April 29 deadline, many felt that Saina should have been focusing more on practice and competing in these tournaments.

Of these eight tournaments, the Asia Team Championships, All England, India Open, Malaysia Open and Asia Individual Championships help fetch a player several ranking points.

If she reaches the semi-final of any two of these tournaments, Saina may qualify. However, in the process, if she sustains an injury, that would be the end of the Olympic dream for her. Staying fit is the key for this 29-year-old, who became the first Indian shuttler to win an Olympic bronze in London in 2012.

With around 24 international titles to her credit, Saina is the most successful Indian shuttler.

She is also credited for playing a dominant role in the modern badminton revolution, in which she, along with her badminton coach Pullela Gopichand changed the face of Indian badminton, making the country a powerhouse in the world.

The chalk white lungs put up on January 14

MUMBAI: In an experiment that has shown Mumbaikars the impact of air pollution on their health, the HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter lungs installation at Bandra has changed in colour from chalk white to black in two weeks. By comparison, HEPA lungs installed in Delhi on November 2018 took six days to turn black while another in Bengaluru on January 2018 took 25 days.HEPA filter lungs that can mimic breathing and have the ability to capture pollutants were installed outside R D National College on January 14 and began to change from the second day.“High levels of particulate matter in the air, caused in large part due to vehicular emissions and dust, were trapped in the HEPA filters. This has proved to be one of the simplest yet visually effective ways of showcasing what the deteriorating air quality in the city is doing to our lungs,” said Shikha Kumar, campaigns manager, Jhatkaa.org, a digital advocacy organisation which along with NGO Waatavaran Foundation is conducting the experiment.Dr Sanjeev Mehta, chief pulmonologist, Lilavati Hospital, said, “There might not be an exact scientific resemblance between the filters and the lungs but this is the best possible way to demonstrate what happens inside people’s body on inhaling polluted air.”Between installation day and January 27, Mumbai’s overall Air Quality Index (AQI), according to System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), was in the poor category (201-300) for nine days.With the installation’s proximity to colleges, several students have noticed the lungs changing colour. Shloka Kamath, a BMM student at MMK College, Bandra, said, “I am concerned. The instant solution would be to reduce private transport. The government should take more initiatives to curb pollution.”The billboard will remain on display till January 31. “Once it is brought down, plans are in place to cut HEPA filter lungs into small pieces and send these out to decision-makers with a detailed note to highlight even Mumbai’s air is toxic and air pollution is not just a problem of Delhi. We have a young and dynamic environment minister in Aaditya Thackeray and a new state government under Uddhav Thackeray. We want them to take a lead in making Mumbai’s air cleaner,” said Bhagwan Keshbhat, founder, Waatavaran.Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the overall air quality index further improved to 80 from 88 on Tuesday; it is in the satisfactory category.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73751322,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-605527,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pollution-alert-in-just-2-wks-lungs-installation-turns-black/articleshow/73744708.cms
436,['30/01/2020'],"THE BIG DATA LOSS: PVT AGENCY ‘DELETES’ NU SUMMER EXAM FORMS, COLLEGES IN A TIZZY","This story is from January 30, 2020

Nagpur: The Nagpur University (NU) exam section has asked its 503 affiliated colleges to re-submit hard copies as well as upload summer exam forms of all the students from all courses as its records maintained by Promarc Private Ltd have mysteriously been deleted.

Allegedly to keep the bungle under wraps, the exam section has refrained from issuing any notice but sent out verbal instructions to college clerks. When college clerks asked for the reason, they were told that ‘some button’ was accidentally pressed which lead to the mega data loss.

The affiliated colleges are spread in Nagpur, Bhandara, Gondia and Wardha districts.

TOI spoke to several principals who initially were unaware about this but confirmed about the instructions from university only after speaking to their staff.

The development has sent colleges officials into a tizzy. It is being feared that the exercise may lead to not just delay in generating hall tickets for the summer exams starting from February 29 but also errors in subjects opted by students and corresponding fees.

In case college or NU officials make wrong entry or miss a subject, hall tickets will have errors which eventually may deprive students from exam.

Vice-chancellor SP Kane, acting pro-VC Vinayak Deshpande and Promarc director Mayur Katyayan didn’t answer TOI’s calls and messages in this regard.

Students submit hard copies of exam forms and the fee to colleges which upload them on NU’s portal. In the last couple of days, the exam section asked college clerks to redo the processing.

A couple of clerks said that they can do it only if they find the forms. They also complained about the online portal not working properly for last few days.

TOI has consistently reported the blunders committed by Promarc which was arbitrarily awarded several NU exam works after it was first roped in 2012.

In 2016, Promarc had bagged the contract for pre and post exam work (data entry) for an undisclosed amount amid allegations of a mega scam.

Director of examinations and evaluation Prafulla Sabale tried to downplay the incident. “It is a technical error and there is no need to worry. We will resolve it in a day or two,” he said.

Padhvidhar Mahasangh president and former management council member Mahendra Nimbarte demanded strict action against Promarc saying it is a bigger mess than Kohchade scam.

“It proves the company is not competent enough. I had submitted a report in the council on the antecedent of the company, yet it was preferred. Promarc is using NU’s infrastructure and computers, and still getting paid. There is certainly collusion between top officers and Promarc,” he said.

Nimbarte said earlier data losses have gone unreported. “ Questions specific to Promarc are dropped in Senate,” he said.

He alleged the data was deliberately deleted to help certain students. “The exam forms are filled on the basis of previous semester mark sheet. In this hurry, if a backlog subject is not mentioned and the student claims he had filled it up then NU may have to pass him as special case,” he said.

CUTTACK: The Orissa high court has sought a detailed report from the state government on compliance with its earlier order issued in connection with the notification and guidelines to reduce the weight of school bags of students.

The court was hearing a PIL on the problem of the burden of heavy school bags on schoolchildren on Monday.

During the hearing, advocate-petitioner Kanhayalal Sharma filed an affidavit alleging that the notification and guidelines were not being implemented in true spirit and blatantly flouted by schools across the state in general, and in Cuttack, in particular.

“The district education officers (DEOs) too were not implementing the order issued by the court on August 5 last year,” Sharma had further alleged in his affidavit.

Taking note of the affidavit, the division bench of acting Chief Justice Sanju Panda and Justice SK Sahoo posted the matter to March 2, while directing the state school and mass education department to file the compliance report on the August 5, 2019 court order.

The court’s August 5 order said, “The district education officer of every district is directed to implement the aforesaid scheme (the state government’s March 8, 2019 guideline) in its true spirit”.

On March 8 last year, the state government had notified a guideline to reduce the weight of school bags of students. The guidelines were applicable to all government, aided and unaided private schools with classes till the Xth standard.

According to the notification, the weight of the school bag with textbooks and notebooks was to be limited to 1.5 kg for Class I and II students, two to three kg (Class III to V), four kg (VI to VII), 4.5 kg (Class VIII to IX) and five kg (Class X).

In his affidavit, Sharma had further alleged that the state government’s order for special squads to deal with the problem of heavy school bags on young children had virtually been limited to pen and paper.

On August 1 last year, the state government had issued orders for the formation of special squads at the district-level to check the weight of school bags of children and ensure that they didn’t exceed the prescribed limit.

As per a government August 1, 2019 order, squads at the district-level were to be formed by the district collectors along with the district education officers/district project coordinators as chairman and block education officers, police officials and workers of voluntary and non-Government organisations as its members.

The squads were to visit all schools, including those affiliated to the ICSE and CBSE boards regularly, and also conduct surprise checks to verify if they were complying with the government order.

440,['30/01/2020'],Non-Muslim areas stay aloof from Bharat Bandh against CAA-NRC,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Nagpur: The Bharat bandh against NRC-CAA called by Bahujan Kranti Manch (BKM), a part of BAMCEF , an Ambedkarite organization, had total impact in pockets like Mominpura , Teka Naka, and Jafar Nagar , with predominant Muslim population.

Sporadic incidents, like stone pelting by a group at Pachpaoli bridge, and confrontation with local shopkeepers in Jaripatka, were reported. The bandh otherwise remained peaceful in the city. No offence was registered by the police, neither did they use force against the protesters.

Near Pachpaoli bridge, policemen tried to stop the advancing protesters, but were outnumbered by the crowd which went ahead, though, the matter did not escalate further.

For a brief period, at around 1:30pm, a groups of protesters marching from Kamptee, blocked the road at the busy Automotive Square. At Jafar Nagar and Gittikhadan, where shopkeepers, including Muslims, had kept establishments open, had to down the shutters after a mob reached there. The march eventually culminated at Samvidhan Chowk.

The call was also supported by Jamiat-e-Ulema-e-Hind, a body of clerics which was the key factor for gathering numbers for the agitation.

Even as residents in areas like Mominpura and Jafar Nagar were seen voluntarily responding to the bandh, a similar sentiment was not seen in the Dalit pockets, which have also been a key target segment for the anti NRC-CAA brigade.

The by-lanes of Mominpura, which remain clogged with people usually, were rather empty on Wednesday. The shops and eateries at Mominpura did not open at all. People walked out of their homes, holding tricolor in hand, to reach Samvidhan Chowk, where thousands had gathered by afternoon.

Groups of youths from the same locality also headed out towards other areas in the city, including north Nagpur, insisting that shopkeepers down their shutters. Lately there have been attempts to include other communities like Dalit, Marathas and OBCs into the movement. However, not much presence of other groups could be seen during the protests.

As TOI went around areas like Indora, Jaripatka and Pachpaoli, a mixed response could be seen in the localities. Political workers here said locals have still not connected with the cause. There was no call to join the protest by the community leaders too, despite the fact that BKM, which gave the call, is an Ambedkarite organization. “Even if the shopkeepers downed shutters on seeing the protesters, the support was not voluntary,” said a source here.

TOI travelled with a group of protesters supporting the bandh. People could be seen downing the shutters only as they came. The protesters requested them with folded hands to support the bandh but there was confrontation with local shopkeepers at Jaripatka too.

Meanwhile, at Mominpura, the locals said Muslims will be directly affected by NRC. There are many who don’t have their papers to prove their nationality. “Even I was born at my home and don’t have the papers to prove that I am an Indian citizen,” said Abrar Ahmed, who is in his 60s.

President of Jamiat-e-Ulema’s Nagpur unit Hafiz Masood Ahmed said, “It’s unfortunate that despite large-scale protests throughout the country, the government has failed to act. However, we will continue the agitation, till the demands are met.”

BAMCEF is mainly an organization of government workers who cannot come out openly, due to which the number of presenters was low. However, they have been supporting the movement from behind, said Rehmatullah Syed of BAMCEF.

Bhopal: State Congress on Wednesday said the BJP is politicizing the murder of a Scheduled Caste youth Dhanprasad Ahirwar. “The BJP raised slogans when the body was taken for last rites in Sagar,” state PCC media department chairperson Shobha Oza said.

“It is shameful how the BJP involved the family of the deceased in their political rally. The BJP is trying to take political advantage,” she said.

Dhanprasad Ahirwar, resident of Motinagar area in Sagar, was allegedly set ablaze by his neighbours after an altercation on January 14. He was admitted in a local hospital where he was under treatment for three days. “The moment the administration came to know about the incident, he was shifted to Hamidia hospital in Bhopal. The state government later airlifted him to Delhi where he was admitted in AIIMS but succumbed on January 23,” PCC spokesman and chief minister’s media convener Narendra Saluja said.

BJP has been alleging that government and police negligence led to the death of Dhanprasad Ahirwar. On Tuesday, top BJP leaders had held a protest demanding death for the accused.

Congress said that Ahirwar’s widow was taken to a protest rally by the BJP just five days after she lost her husband. PCC working president Surendra Choudhary said, “BJP tried to disrupt peace and communal harmony in Sagar on Tuesday. The deceased Dhanprasad’s brother Dhaniram Ahirwar gave in writing to the police that the incident was the result of a fight between neighbours but BJP wanted to make it a communal issue. How can anyone think of politically using a widow who lost her husband five days ago?”

Congress claimed that police have arrested all five accused in the case, offered a government job on compassionate grounds to the family of the deceased and Rs 4,12,000 has been transferred to the bank account of a family member. “The BJP made the incident a political event,” Narendra Saluja said.

Swamyji told us that he is minutely examining the bill passed by the government.”Semwal added that the group would meet other senior BJP and RSS leaders in Delhi, pressing for their demand to scrap the new Act. “We are trying to meet as many senior BJP leaders as possible to tell them how the new law is a violation of old scared Hindu traditions and values,” Semwal said.Congress MLA Manoj Rawat also supported the idea of fighting a legal battle against the new law. “As per the new law, now all previous Acts, registration, would automatically become invalid and only the government-appointed IAS officer would be the competent authority to take all the decisions,” Rawat said.He added that the government’s decision to have an administrative set up similar to the Vaishno Devi Shrine board is flawed. “Vaishno Devi temple and Char Dham are distinctly different and cannot have one set of management rules. The state government should have considered this aspect and kept all local priests in the loop before finalising the new law.”",dehradun,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/shrine-board-priests-meet-swamy-seek-legal-intervention/articleshow/73740522.cms

Loop Road near Light House

CHENNAI: Responding to a not-so-light nudge by the Madras high court , the city corporation has unveiled a six-week timeframe to retrieve the Marina Loop Road from the clutches of encroachers, and to construct a footpath along it.

Recording the submission on Wednesday, a division bench of Justice Vineet Kothari and Justice R Suresh Kumar reiterated that its goal is to make the Marina a beach of international standard, and added that it would achieve it without interfering in the livelihood of fishermen. Noting that the fishermen community should cooperate with the high court to achieve the objective, the bench directed that no subordinate court shall entertain any kind of application or suit or petition on matters relating to the Marina beach and the Loop Road development, which are being monitored by the court.

On its part, the corporation explained the reason for seeking six weeks to commence the Loop Road work. “We would require an outer time limit of six weeks, so that requisite formalities may be completed by the corporation within two weeks and thereafter, in one-week time to forward the report from the state coastal zone management authority to the central environment ministry, and then in next three weeks, necessary approvals would be received from the ministry,” additional advocate general S R Rajagopal said.

On the purchase of smart carts to be distributed to licensed vendors on Marina and fixing fair rent for the carts, Rajagopal sought a week to file a report. As to the relief sought by the PIL-petitioner, Fishermen Care, to increase the allowance provided to families of fishermen during the fishing ban period, Madanagopal Rao, senior standing counsel for the central government, sought more time to get instructions from the authorities concerned.

Recording the same, the bench said, “If any petition is directly filed in this court, the registry is directed to attach such petitions with relation to aforesaid matters, with the present pleas and with the approval of the Chief Justice, those matters may also be placed before this bench.” The court posted the pleas to February 4.

Arms seized from the Reds

Nagpur: Gadchiroli police arrested two Chhattisgarh-based Maoists and three supporters, carrying reward of lakhs of rupees on their heads, from Perimilbhatti in the Reds’ stronghold Abujhmadh on the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border on Wednesday. There was an exchange of fire of the C-60 commandos with the Maoists on Tuesday and also on Wednesday, before the arrests were effected.

It’s learnt the elite district police C60 commandos were dispatched for the inhospitable and forested stretch of Perimilbhatti in Abujhmadh, around 35km east of Maharashtra’s last police post at Laheri near Beenagunda, following an input regarding a camp of the Maoists. The C60 commandos had to engage with the Company No. 1 formation of the Maoists before the arrests were made. The company No.1 of the Maoists is learnt to be deployed for the protection and passage of senior cadres.

SP Shailesh Balkawade, who supervised the operation, said senior members of the Maoists’ apex body of Central Committee (CC) was to meet to brainstorm some issues at the spot. “We just missed some of their top cadres. The names of the senior leaders and their agenda would come to fore once the literature seized from the place is translated,” he said.

“We have so far learnt that the Divisional Committee Member (DVC) Ranita of Kutul dalam was present at the site,” said the SP.

Police have also seized three firearms and some other material from the place. It’s learnt that the C60 commandos had an exchange of fire with the Maoists on Tuesday but there was another round of firing on Wednesday when the security forces tried to venture into the deep.

The arrested Maoists, Rainu Wadde (20) and Bandu Wadde (25), both members of Kutul area committee, were tracked down at the Perimilbhatti village. The commandos had also taken Sukhram Usendi (40), Doghe Usendi (30) and Keye Wadde (40) from the same village for their alleged role as militia.

SP Balkawade confirmed the names of Rainu and Bandu in the records of the police department as members of Kutul area committee.

Thiruvananthapuram: Building grassroots-level awareness , targeting families and the public, is the effective way to root out drug menace , said excise minister T P Ramakrishnan . Inaugurating the state-level anti-drug workshop on Wednesday, he said that implementing a law to ban addiction is not the policy of the government.

“The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act enacted by the Centre is ineffective in Kerala. We had requested the Centre for an amendment, but it was not heeded,” Ramakrishnan said. The workshop was conducted by state’s drug and addiction-free mission ‘Vimukthi’, launched by the excise department, as part of the ongoing 90-day anti-drug awareness drive on the theme ‘Tomorrow’s Kerala Addiction-Free Kerala’.

“Library councils have a close connect with the common man and they must be used for achieving Vimukthi’s goals. The proposed anti-drug clubs under public libraries across the state should work responsibly to contain the grave situation and take forward the initiative,” he said, adding that politics should not be a hindrance while involving people in anti-drug campaigns.

“There are de-addiction centres in all districts and each centre has 10 beds. Government has decided to increase the number of beds at these centres. Counselling centres are functioning in Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Kozhikode. A Rs 100-crore model de-addiction centre will be opened at Kinalur in Kozhikode, with central aid. Treatment facilities, a job skill development project and rehabilitation will be implemented at the centre,” the minister said. tnn

Former Team India captain MS Dhoni with his family and freinds during safari at Kanha national park

Bhopal: Former India skipper M S Dhoni went on a tiger safari at Mukkee Range of Kanha National Park on Wednesday, apparently drawn to it by a recent viral video of two tigers fighting it out over a mate.

Dhoni spotted a tiger, and it was the first time he saw one in the wild, said sources. The cricketing legend is on vacation with friends and family at Kanha.

Mahi, who has taken a break from cricket, will stay at a resort in Kanha till January 31. Dhoni, his wife Sakshi and close relatives and friends arrived by a chartered plane that landed at Birsi Airstrip, Baiher, on Tuesday. As soon as news of Dhoni’s arrival leaked, fans rushed to get a glimpse of the legend. Social media was soon awash with photos of Dhoni obliging locals, foresters and resort staff for selfies. The Kanha National Park website said it’s Dhoni’s first visit to the tiger sanctuary. Dhoni’s love for tigers is well known. He adopted tiger Agasthya at the Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens (Mysore zoo) for a year in 2011.

On Wednesday, he set out on safari around 6am, hoping to see tiger in the wild. Sources said Dhoni seemed fascinated by the viral tiger-fight video and asked foresters if they knew where exactly it occurred. His wish came true and he did spot a tiger at Kanha. There are more safaris on Dhoni’s itinerary and he also plans to camp in the forest for a day, said sources.

“I am told he saw a tiger in the morning, during safari. I cannot tell you anything else as he is on a personal visit,” said Kanha field director L Krishnamurthi. Kanha gets a steady stream of celebrities. Among those who have visited the sanctuary are actors Sonakshi Sinha and Sonam Kapoor.

File photo of Marina beach

CHENNAI: Given the increasing incidence of drowning off the Marina , a rescue services station with a special force of 50 commandos to help victims, was inaugurated on Wednesday. The commandos have been specially trained in live-saving measures to handle emergencies.

This is a first-of-its-kind facility on the beach. According to fire rescue officers, these 50 personnel have been exclusively trained to rescue people who are washed away by tidal waves. “They are still undergoing training,” said a fire officer.

The unit has come up on Besant Road near the Marina. The training is continuing for the commandos-turned-lifeguards as they have to be well-versed in life-saving procedures and need to familiarise themselves with the safety equipment they use. They are also expected to use personal life-safety equipment to prevent harm to themselves during rescue operations, sources said. As of now, the unit is equipped with emergency oxygen cylinders for victims who have trouble breathing, life jackets made of polyester fabric and stuffed with foam that are used to keep a person buoyant in water and ring buoys, a safety equipment for lifeguards, for deep-sea rescues. This is placed around the victim’s waist or under the armpits to help them float. They are usually made of shells filled with dense foam and coloured bright orange for visibility.

A rescue tube made of high-density foam and used in multiple ways to protect the victim from drowning is also a part of the unit. Apart from this, a backboard, also known as a spineboard, has been made available to rescue victims who have suffered injuries in the water or are unconscious and unable to support themselves.

Police suspect the techie, Ragi Karthik, might have taken the extreme step over a failed affair. “There was no suicide note. But, we are suspecting that he may have committed suicide due to love failure,” said Raidurgam inspector S Ravinder.

Police said Karthik did not go to office on Tuesday. His four roommates came back at 10 pm and found the room door locked from inside. Suspecting foul-play, they broke open the door only to find Karthik hanging.

A case of suspicious death was registered and his body was shifted to Osmania General Hospital for autopsy.

NEW DELHI: Greater Kailash assembly constituency is unlike most others that grapple with issues of development. With upper-middle-class residents in extended areas, the sore points here have to do with problems created by affluence. Many households have vehicles beyond the capacity of their bungalows’ parking space, and keeping them on footpaths and roads has created congestion on the streets. It is also common to find people complaining about the commercial use of residential properties.Complete coverage on Delhi electionsLack of parking space is a big concern in the constituency, which is made up of Greater Kailash I and II, Panchsheel, Chittaranjan Park, some middle-class localities like Sant Nagar, Sheikh Sarai and DDA flat owners in Kalkaji, urbanised villages like Chirag Dilli, Shahpur Jat and some slum clusters. The residents complain that with shops and restaurants opening almost every day in different parts of the constituency, traffic management is as much a problem as finding space for parking. Many roads, especially the internal colony roads, are also in poor condition.The assembly constituency offers a window to the mood of the middle- and upper-middle-class voters of the city. In 2013 and 2015, AAP’s Saurabh Bharadwaj won this seat and the sitting MLA hopes to make it a hat-trick this year. But BJP, which has represented Greater Kailash in the past, is equally hopeful of its candidate, SDMC councillor Shikha Rai, wresting the seat from AAP this year.Keeping in mind the middle-class voters, Rai reminds people that AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal had promised never to accept VIP culture, send the corrupt to jail and install the Lokpal, none of which has been achieved. “They did not work for four years and a half, but lately carried out cosmetic work to impress the people. The government is elected for five years, not a few months,” Rai said.She also alleged that free electricity has been given only for two months, while claiming that many areas in the constituency had chocked sewage lines and erratic supply of tap water of dubious quality.Bharadwaj hotly denied any sewerage problems. “It was an issue five years ago, but spending Rs 23 crore, we changed the trunk sewer line. The sewerage in the entire constituency has been cleaned,” he said, adding that five years ago water supply was a major lack in the neighbourhoods but had been adequately addressed since. Bharadwaj also said that dirty water was absolutely not a problem in any of the localities.The sitting MLA pointed out that within four months of AAP coming to power, he had got the overly congested Bus Rapid Transit corridor dismantled to allow smoother flow of traffic.Congress claims to enjoy support among the people, particularly in the villages. It has fielded a local, Sukhbir Singh Pawar from Shahpur Jat village, who maintains that AAP and BJP have ruined Greater Kailash and people will vote for ‘Congress Wali Dilli’.Many voters are unhappy with security in the area. Cases of snatching and theft of cars or cars being broken into are often reported. The elderly are particularly anxious. Many streets have dark spots that make women returning from work in the evenings looking over their shoulders. In Greater Kailash I, a resident muttered, “The colony has lost its charm. Encroached pavements, chaotic three wheelers, the menace of stray dogs, stinking public toilets mar life in the colony.”The longstanding problem of waterlogging has been dealt with in several areas. There are other signs of civic progress: boom barriers for improved security, mohalla clinics, CCTV cameras, and in parks game equipment for children, ornamental benches and gazebos. The urbanised villages too have seen development projects.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73754708,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-722653,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/stuck-in-the-middle-some-civic-woessorted-parking-security-not-so-great/articleshow/73746886.cms

CHENNAI: Avoiding ice creams and cool drinks or gulping down herbal concoctions may not prevent you from contracting coronavirus . And you don’t need to stock up on masks either, say infectious disease and public health experts.As messages regarding the virus flood social media, health care experts say there is no need to panic, though spread of the disease may be inevitable. “More cases are likely to be identified in the coming days across the globe, including Tamil Nadu. It is also likely that person-to-person spread will occur,” said director of public health Dr K Kolandaiswamy. “But coronavirus isn’t new. It’s a family of viruses that are quite common. It’s the virus that causes the common cold. In severe forms, it can cause respiratory distress and death. The outbreak in China has kept health systems on alert because of the novel strain,” he said.Prevention for this virus will be like any other flu. “Personal hygiene, particularly hand wash , is important,” he said. “Drinking a lots of water, using hand towels or flexed elbows while sneezing, staying at home when there are symptoms such as cold and fever will help. It’s also important to meet a doctor if fever persists,” he said.The Union health ministry has asked people with travel history to consult a doctor if they have flu-like symptoms. “They should also avoid exposing themselves to the public,” Kolandaiswamy said. Hospitals have been asked to quarantine patients suspected to have the virus, he said. Else, they can be referred to Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital.Coronavirus is common in camels, cattle, cats and bats. In some cases, animal coronaviruses such as MERS and SARS have affected humans. The novel virus, scientists say, originated from bats. The novel coronavirus, which was first detected in Wuhan City, is now expanding. As the number of cases is going up across the globe and mortality is close to 2%, many health agencies such as the World Health Organisation and Centre for Disease Control, US, are monitoring the situation closely. Experts say, like most respiratory viruses, it has been spreading from person-to-person. Reported illnesses have ranged from infected people with little or no symptoms to those severely ill and dying. “The complete clinical picture is under study,” said Dr V Ramasubramanian, an infectious disease expert.Health secretary Beela Rajesh said the state was closely working with the Centre, WHO and public health partners to respond to this emerging threat. “Since the infection can be imported, we are taking precautions to check health of air passengers.

CHENNAI: The Association of IAS Academies in Tamil Nadu has demanded a thorough inquiry into the Group I exam to find out how 150 of the 181 candidates selected are from just one coaching academy. The selected candidates have taken up posts such as deputy collector and deputy superintendent of police.

The Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC), which began the process for Group I officers selection in January 2019, has completed it just one year.

“One coaching academy is claiming that 150 of the 181 selected are its students. There were hundreds of institutes preparing students from all over the state for TNPSC exams. How is it possible that over 80% of students are from one academy,” asked S Thamizh Iyalan, general secretary of the Association of IAS Academies in Tamil Nadu.

He also raised doubts over the Group I recruitment process including main exam and interview. “The malpractices happened not only in the Group IV exam. It happened in Group II, Group II-A and Group I exams. The reports about candidates who appeared from a few centres getting top ranks, relatives of government officials getting jobs and a large number of people getting Group I postings from a coaching institute have dented the public trust in recruitment process by TNPSC,” he said.

Thamizh Iyalan said such incidents had happened in the past as well and wanted the state government tob order a thorough inquiry and should recommend the probe to CBI to investigate possible involvements of officials from TNPSC. The association is planning to submit a memorandum to the Governor asking him to expedite the probe. “The corrupt elements in TNPSC should be removed before next recruitment process commences,” he said.

Others demanded disclosure of details of the 181 selected for Group I posts. “We have been preparing for years and not able to clear the exam. But, candidates from influential families are able to do so in their first attempt. We demand that the government to release background of 181 candidates,” said Basha, member of the student wing of the association. N Valan, vice-president, said shifting to online tests could help stop such scams. “All central government exams including railways and SSB are now held online. Tamil Nadu also should shift to online tests.”

Bhopal: Come February 11, and a reconstituted Constitution bench will start hearing on a curative petition filed by the government of India seeking Rs 8,444 crore more as compensation towards the Bhopal gas disaster from the Union Carbide or its successor company Dow Chemicals.

A five-member Constitution bench, which was supposed to start hearing on the petition on Tuesday, had postponed the hearing for Wednesday after Justice Ravindra Bhatt, who was part of the Constitution bench formed to hear the petition, recused himself from the bench on the ground that he had appeared on the Union government’s behalf in a litigation over compensation against Bhopal gas disaster before 1989, when the final settlement was reached between government of India and Union Carbide Corporation for Rs 715 crore.

The bench — headed by Justice Arun Mishra — on Wednesday said that the bench would be reconstituted by the chief justice of India and the new Constitution bench would start hearing the petition from February 11.

Government of India had filed the curative petition in the apex court following public outrage after seven Union Carbide officials, tried for the disaster in the chief judicial magistrate’s court in Bhopal, got away with only two years of suspended sentence.

While the prosecuting agency, CBI, had filed a curative petition for enhancing criminal charges against the accused, government of India had filed a curative petition for enhanced compensation against Bhopal gas disaster in year 2011.

456,['30/01/2020'],Screen time making preschool children physically inactive,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Nagpur: Preschool children (aged two to three) who spend more than three hours a day viewing screens such as mobile/tablets/television grow up to be less physically active at age 5.5 years, according to a study published in the internationally acclaimed The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health journal.

The study revealed that children of the same age group whose screen time was less than one hour per day were more likely to have ‘healthier behaviours in later life’.

One way that screen viewing may influence health is by replacing time that would otherwise be spent doing something else, such as physical activity and sleep. The latest study is the first to look at the effects of early-life screen use on daily activity in pre-school children.

Associate Professor Falk Müller-Riemenschneider, from the Saw Swee Hock of Public Health, National University of Singapore, said, “We sought to determine whether screen viewing habits at age two to three affected how children spent their time at age five. In particular we were interested in whether screen viewing affected sleep patterns and activity levels later in childhood.”

Former principal of Centre Point School (Katol Road) Kana Roy Chaudhuri said parents must show restraint when handing over their mobiles. “Parents who give mobiles to kids or feed them while they watch TV is a bad practice and also habit forming,” said Chaudhuri.

Senior teacher at St Joseph’s Convent Junior College, Manisha Mahatme, agreed saying handing over mobiles has become an easy way out. “I hardly see children on the ground as parents prefer to keep them at home or send them to activity class rather than undertake any physical activity. Parents do not have enough time for their children due to their busy schedule, giving mobile in their hand or putting on the TV is easy for parents, that keeps the children busy,” said Mahatme.

But the problem of excessive screen time is going beyond just lack of physical activity , feels Br. Shine, principal of Montfort School. “Spending too much time in virtual world is hampering social skills of the real world. Poor social skills and interpersonal relationship skills are genuine concerns to be addressed. Lack of patience and limited attention span is a growing problem amongst our children due to overuse of smartphones,” said Br. Shine.

Shanoor Mirza, principal of Tata Parsi School, said the extra screen time soon spills over to misuse, which is a bigger concern. “Kids soon start accessing that part of the Internet which is dangerous for them. I know of cases where kids are posting obscene videos and getting exposed to things which are not age appropriate,” said Mirza.

RAIPUR: The Congress government in Chhattisgarh is likely to move a resolution in the assembly in the upcoming budget session to demand scrapping of the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ).

Congress-ruled Punjab and Rajasthan, Left-ruled Kerala and the Trinamool Congress government in West Bengal have already adopted similar resolutions, saying CAA is against the secular fabric of the country.

There are strong indications that the Chhattisgarh cabinet will discuss moving the resolution in the budget session next month at a meeting chaired by CM Bhupesh Baghel on Thursday. The cabinet could consider the draft of the resolution, sources said.

Right from the beginning, CM Baghel has been vocal against CAA and was the first CM to say he will not implement CAA and “will not sign any document related to NRC”. He has dubbed it a law based on religious discrimination, which is against the spirit of the Constitution.

KOLKATA: Four pro-CAA ad films have got stuck at the regional office of the Censor Board of Film Certification, which has sought “expert opinion” on them from two city lawyers. Though the films, directed and produced by Sanghamitra Chaudhuri , were submitted for certification in December, they were finally screened at CBFC’s Kolkata office only last week. The examination report is still pending.

“Certifying ads on any Act needs caution,” said a CBFC source. “The same caution is being exercised in this case, too.” TOI got in touch with regional officer Partho Ghosh , but he refused comment.

“I made the ads after Citizenship (Amendment) Act was passed and applied for certification,” Chaudhuri said. The first ad, she added, shows a Muslim woman asking her daughter whether they have to “return to Bangladesh”. The daughter replies they are residents of this country and CAA will give them Indian citizenship.

The second ad shows six people from different religions. “It shows how PM Modi has ensured they get citizenship,” the filmmaker said. The third ad shows Hindus who are worried about not having documents, and insists that showing documents is not mandatory for CAA. The fourth shows a conversation between a Hindu and a Muslim person.

MUMBAI: A 37-year-old woman from Nalasopara waiting for a train at Andheri station sustained a hairline fracture on the shoulder and escaped serious injuries after a stone fell from an overhead structure. Falgunie Sanghvi was waiting for a Virar-bound train on platform 3 around 10 am on Monday. She was at the south-end of the platform and the debris possibly fell off the south foot over-bridge.

""The extremely heavy construction material could have hit me on the head, had I been standing inches ahead of where I was. I suffered a fracture despite the material having landed on straps of the bag I was carrying on my shoulders,"" said Sanghvi.

She said she was taken to the medical room where she was administered preliminary treatment. ""They offered to take me to Cooper hospital but I refused. I later visited my doctor who advised an x-ray done.""

The doctor spotted a hairline fracture which will take time to heal. ""The treatment cannot start as the doctor is waiting for the swelling to subside. I can't go to work as travelling on overcrowded trains will be a painful task.""

Member of the Zonal Rail Users Consultative Committee, Kailash Verma, said, ""The maintenance team of the estates or construction department must be held responsible as they are supposed to inspect and take corrective steps."" He said such work is on at many stations and contractors must be told to have safety mechanism.

AHMEDABAD: This family of 10 farmers has been minting money from a special type of potato, clocking a revenue of Rs 25 crore per annum, producing on average 20,000 metric tonnes! Jitesh Patel , a potato farmer from Dolpur Kampa village of Arvalli district, turned his and his family’s fortunes around after using his education in agriculture science to begin cultivating the Lady Rosetta (LR) variety of potato.

That variety is widely used for manufacturing potato chips and wafers. Today, he and his family earn crores by supplying the potatoes to leading potato chip manufacturers such as Balaji and ITC. Patel’s family has been growing potatoes for 26 years now. “After I completed MSc in agriculture in 2005, the goal was to return to farming,” said Patel, adding, “Earlier, our family used to cultivate the table variety of potatoes. However, I decided to diversify.”

Patel started cultivating the LR variety over a 10-acre land parcel in 2007. “Since the yield was good, I decided to involve other family members,” Patel told TOI on the sidelines of Global Potato Conclave-2020 in Gandhinagar. “As on date, we are 100% into LR potato cultivation over a land parcel of 1,000 acres,” he said.

Industry experts have underlined that the demand for the LR variety is poised to rise. “Potato chip manufacturers need consistent supply and quality of the LR variety,” said Sachid Madan, chief executive, Technico Agri Sciences Limited. “One lakh tonne of this variety was exported in 2019 from Gujarat to leading markets such as Indonesia , Kuwait, Oman and Saudi Arabia ,” he said.

Patel said all the ten members of his family have expertise in diverse areas, including breeding, pathology, microbiology, entomology and horticulture. The LR variety of potato is supplied to wafer and chip manufacturers based on a long-term contract and it fetches rates as high as Rs 17 per kg.

Recalling his longstanding association with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Ramdev said, “I have known Modi for more than 15 years, and I can assure you that he cannot be called anti-Muslim. There is nothing in the CAA that threatens the rights of Muslims, some of whom are being misled by a few.”

The yoga guru said that, while 99% of the Muslims in India were patriotic, the remaining ones were seeking to divide the country, which he said was resulting in Islam falling into disgrace. “I appeal to all Muslims to keep away from such anti-national forces seeking to bring a bad name to Islam,” said Ramdev, calling on the people to stay united in the face of the severe economic crisis that the country was presently in the grips of.

He added that he was as committed to his goal of getting black money back to India. However, when quizzed by journalists as to how long he was willing to wait for PM Modi to realise this objective, Ramdev said, “Chodi, mere aur Modi ke beech jagada mat lao (Please do not incite a fight between Modi and me).”

The yoga guru also endorsed the decision of the Centre to recognise singer Adnan Sami with a Padma award.

Nagaraj Banjara is a physical education teacher at a government school in Kottur, Ballari

Kottur (Ballari district): Nagaraj Banjara, a physical education teacher at Government High School in Bayalu Tumbaraguddi, Kottur taluk, Ballari districts, has been a good friend of civic workers here for the past eight years. He works with them for an hour daily and more on holidays. He helps them get their rights and facilities. He has also created awareness about cleanliness among the public by carrying placards and flag on his bicycle.

Attributing his initiative to his late father Meghanayak, who worked as a peon at Kottureshwar College and maintained cleanliness and greenery throughout his service, Banjara told TOI: “I realised the value of his words only after his death. I was thinking of doing something for the society to maintain cleanliness. I thought of working with pourakarmikas but there was strong resistance from my family. Many neighbours and friends started making fun of me. Even pourakarmikas suggested I stay away. Now, I work with them for an hour in the morning and leave for school later and more on Sundays and general holidays.”

Shankranna, organising secretary, Taluk Pourakarmikasa Sangh, said: “This ‘meshtru’ (teacher) has been instrumental in bringing many facilities from social organisations. Earlier, no one bothered about us. We were least bothered about our health and precautionary measures to prevent illness. He motivated us to take care of ourselves by using gloves. He convinced us not to burn garbage which may cause diseases like cancer. He even sensitised us about our rights and facilities provided by government agencies.”

Manjunath, Girish, Halesh and other pourakarmikas, said Nagaraj Meshtru has been a friend of all 40 pourakarmikas in Kottur. “When people celebrate festivals like Deepavali, Ganesha and Eid at home, this ‘meshtru’ joins us the next day to clean the town. During Kartika Masa, he joins us to clean temple premises of Kottureshwar, where thousands of people come and light the traditional lamp and throw away oil bowls made of leaves,” they said.

HF Bidari, chief officer, Kottur town panchayat, said Banjara has formed a troupe called ‘Hasiru Sene’ to plant and grow saplings in parks and by roadsides. “He is a role model for all citizens who are prejudiced about pourakarmikas,” he said.

Seeing Banjara’s contribution, Ram Prasath Manohar gifted him a bicycle. He has been using it to create awareness about cleanliness in and around Kottur town. He also play songs about cleanliness and presented street plays in villages. He has also been a resource person for yoga training of the education department.

HDMC wants to procure auto-tippers larger than those presently in its fleet (in picture)

Hubballi: Determined to ensure that households in all the 65 wards under its purview are covered by the door-to-door garbage collection scheme, the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) has decided to deploy more auto-tippers in the twin cities to prevent pile-up of trash. This is part of the civic agency’s overarching plan to cover all households under the initiative, which is bound to go a long way in ensuring effective disposal and management of solid waste , a problem that HDMC , like many other municipalities in the state are grappling with.

HDMC needs as many as 223 auto tippers to implement its plan for covering all households under the initiative, but has only 176 in its fleet at the moment. However, there are plans to add 35 more tippers to the fleet. A proposal has been sent to the regional commissioner in Belagavi seeking permission for the utilisation of Rs 1.7 crore for this purpose.

Sources in the HDMC said that the government regulations prescribe that the civic agency have at its disposal one tipper for 1,000 houses, however the ratio is slightly skewed given the shortage of these special-purpose vehicles in its fleet. “At the moment, we have one tipper for 1,200 houses. Solid waste management is hamstrung by the shortage of tippers in our fleet, owing to which HDMC has been facing the wrath of an irate public,” said a source.

Under the Smart City project, the HDMC had initially planned to purchase 15 tippers, but it was decided to procure an additional 22 using the special grants sanctioned to the civic agency. The HDMC, in its proposal to the regional commissioner, has suggested purchasing tippers larger in size compared to those presently in its fleet.

HDMC commissioner Suresh Itnal said that efficiency of solid waste management was predicated on having an adequate number of tippers in the civic agency’s fleet. “We drafted the proposal after a thorough assessment of our requirements, and sent it to the regional commissioner’s office in Belagavi. We are hopeful of our proposal being approved, and once that happens, we will initiate the procurement process. We are hoping to add 37 more tippers to our fleet in a month-and-a-half,” said Itnal, adding that having more of these vehicles would help the agency stay prepared in the event of a few tippers breaking down to ensure that garbage collection was not hobbled by unforeseen circumstances.

Barapede Caves, nestled in Talevadi village in the core area of Bhimgad Wildlife Sanctuary

Belagavi: The lesser-known fact of Belagavi : there is a space in the district that is highly secured, probably one of the most-secured places in the world, which the nocturnal mammals have made their home.

Barapede caves, nestled in Talevadi village amidst the core area of Bhimgad Wildlife Sanctuary (BWS) is out of bounds for people. According to forest officials, the endangered nocturnal mammal specie of Wroughton’s free-tailed bats is a major factor for the 200sqkm forest area to be notified as a wildlife sanctuary. The bats were categorised in the IUCN Red List as “threatened species” in 2016. Earlier, the specie was identified as “critically endangered”. BWS is one of the three safest habitats in the world for them, the other being Meghalaya and Cambodia.

According to the data available with the forest department, the specie was first discovered in Belagavi in 1913 by the British. A survey was conducted during 2004-06 to know their population.

Deputy conservator of forests (Belagavi) Amarnath M V told TOI that Barapede is the most-secured place, at least in south India. “In 2011, this forest was notified as wildlife sanctuary and bats played a major role in this. This happened after the survey, which put the population of Wroughton’s free-tailed bats at 200. Though there has been no survey ever since, the place has been secured to further increase the population,” he explained.

He further said people are not allowed to Barapede unless they have a strong reason to go there. The residents of Talevadi do not disturb, even as watchers of the forest department keep strict vigil.

Assistant donservator of forests Shashidhar, who looks after the area, said no one has visited the place in the last six months.

As per an interaction with local watchers of the department, the population may have risen to 400. “However, this is not the authentic data as it is not backed by a survey. The bats are one of the key reasons behind the place being notified as high-security zone,” he added.

NEW DELHI: In a first, the road transport ministry will notify the third-party insurance premium for motor vehicles in consultation with the insurance regulator, IRDA . The change was introduced in the Motor Vehicle Act to ensure that consumer interest is protected and there is some check on the influence of insurance firms to increase the premium for mandatory third-party insurance, sources said.

“Earlier we used to fix the premium for third-party insurance cover. Once the rules are framed, this will be the task of the transport ministry. The amended law says that for the purposes of third party insurance related to either death of a person or grievous hurt, the central government shall prescribe a base premium and the liability of an insurer in relation to such premium for an insurance policy,” a senior functionary of Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India told TOI. Currently, IRDA has the authority to notify the premium amount for different categories of vehicles.

A government source said there had been complaints by transporters and owners of commercial vehicles that IRDA usually increases their thirdparty premium abnormally every year and this has been one of the reasons for transporters’ strikes in the past. He added that IRDA was reluctant to revise the rate even after meetings were held with officials from finance and transport ministry in 2017.

The transport ministry will soon notify the rules specifying how it will fix the premium amount for each category of vehicle. To ensure that insurance firms settle claims quickly, the Centre is likely to extend the mandatory submission detailed accident report by police to motor accident tribunals within one month of accident to all states. This will ensure quick relief to victims as the compensation payment will get expedited.

MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar (File photo)

NEW DELHI: After US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a Middle East peace plan, which calls for a Palestine state with capital in eastern Jerusalem, India urged the Palestinians and Israelis to engage with each other and consider the US proposal, while reiterating its own support for a twostate solution which is acceptable to all. Trump’s peace plan was rejected by the Palestinians as it recognises Israeli settlements in the West Bank and proposes Jerusalem as Israel’s undivided capital.

“As you are aware, India has been consistently supportive of the Palestinian cause. India has also called for a twostate solution to the Israeli-Palestinian issue. We reiterate our view that the final status issues should be resolved through direct negotiations between the two parties and be acceptable to both,’’ said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar. “We urge the parties to engage with each other, including on the recent proposals put forward by the US, and find an acceptable twostate solution for peaceful coexistence. We will continue to follow developments in the region and engage with the parties concerned,’’ he added.

Foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on Wednesday said he will work with India’s international partners to seek a shared, undifferentiated and unambiguous approach to terrorism and the threat it poses to free societies. Shortly after he took over from his predecessor Vijay Gokhale , Shringla also called for sustaining the gains of “a rules-based multilateral order’’.

“As Foreign Secretary, I look forward to working with India’s many partners in the international system – in enhancing developmental and economic linkages, as well as connectivity with our neighbours; building synergies with major powers,’’ said Shringla in a statement.

A 1984-batch officer of the Indian Foreign Service (IFS) who last served as India's ambassador to the US, Shringla replaced Gokhale and will have a fixed two-year tenure. Gokhale retired on Tuesday. Shringla had earlier also served as ambassador to Thailand and Bangladesh.

“Enhancing the security and prosperity of India through external ties and the well-being of all Indians, wherever they may be, is our mission statement,’’ he said.

Several other recent opportunities and challenges related to the cyber domain and emerging technologies will also receive attention during his tenure, the 57-year-old diplomat said, adding that the external affairs ministry fully appreciates the critical nature of these issues for the country and planet.

""I entered the IFS during the Cold War and I am entering the FS office at a time when global warming has become a pressing concern,"" he said in the statement.

Sharing the Indian developmental experience with countries of the global South, especially with friends in Africa and Latin America, will continue to be a priority, Shringla said, adding that he also looks forward to the opening of new diplomatic missions and the inauguration of new initiatives.

Speaking to reporters before taking the charge, Shringla said he was very clear that foreign service is a public service and its every effort should be dedicated to contributing towards the nation in the form of its security and prosperity through external engagements.

""I am as committed to the ministry's role in nation-building as I was almost 36 years ago when I entered these portals as a young professional. I look forward to functioning under the guidance of the Prime Minister and the External Affairs Minister , our political leadership and with the support and cooperation of my colleagues both within the ministry and outside,"" he said.

CHENNAI: A prank call that landed at the police control room on Tuesday claimed that miscreants have buried a man alive on the banks of Cooum.

The caller claimed that somebody was murdered and buried on the banks of Cooum near Sathya Sai Nagar. A police team led by inspector M Ravi went to the area and dug up the spot where flowers had been placed. However, they found that a dog had been buried there.

Police said the land was unoccupied after settlements in the locality were evacuated recently and some people had buried their pet there. It was not a murder as the caller had claimed, said police.

Kolkata: Trinamool Congress has alleged that the Centre’s attempt to divest its complete stake in Air India came at a time when a parliamentary committee was examining it. TMC said the Centre had removed its senior party MP as chairperson of the parliamentary standing committee on transport, tourism and culture — that included aviation — and gave the post to a BJP Rajya Sabha MP from Andhra Pradesh.

TMC’s Rajya Sabha leader Derek O’Brien said on Wednesday: “Breaking all precedents, government took away chairmanship of transport (including aviation) committee from Trinamool, the third largest party in the Parliament and self-gifted it to BJP.” He said the new chairman “must take suo motu cognizance” of the proposed sale move and immediately convene a meeting. A senior party MP hinted that the proposed sale was being examined by a committee. TMC MP Mala Ray is part of this committee.

Kolkata: When Kolkata Police set up a social media cell, it did not foresee that the initiative would help save a life more than 1,000km away.

Sub-inspector Abhijit Dutta and constable Kokhon Ghosh spent over 40 minutes in anxiety after they received an alert from the US and informed Guwahati Police even as they watched a woman tying a knot from the fan of her bedroom and putting the noose around her neck.

It was, however, in the nick of time that the Guwahati rural police reached the spot and saved the woman. Later, her grateful husband spoke to the cyber cell officers and said he would visit Kolkata soon to meet them.

“The cyber police station received an email from Facebook authority of the US at 12.50am on Wednesday that a Facebook user had uploaded a video on her profile wherein it was clear she was trying to commit suicide. The Facebook authority also provided the access logs, registered phone number and name of the city,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar.

Twice earlier, at Kolkata’s Picnic Garden and at Bishnupur in South 24 Parganas, the cyber cell helped save lives, making this a nodal agency for the US giant, claimed police sources.

Based upon the information from Facebook, enquiry was initiated and it transpired that the lady is a resident of Capital Campus, around 25km from the main Guwahati city. “Accordingly, we contacted the Changsari police station. It took a few calls to connect and a precious few moments were lost. But the Assam police team acted immediately on getting our SOS,” said the officer.

The Assam police rushed to the spot and rescued the lady a whisker from death. “We came to know she is suffering from mental trauma due to a personal issue. However, after due persuasion and counselling by both Kolkata and Assam police personnel, the lady was rescued and admitted to hospital. Her husband rushed to the hospital. After treatment, she is in a stable condition,” said an IPS officer at Lalbazar.

“Security agencies did not alert me when I left Raj Bhavan. I did not write to the Centre about Tuesday’s incident. But I am in deep pain because what happened is in contrast to Bengal’s culture and many people had called me to mark their protest. This was not a loss for me, but the entire academia is shocked by the turn of events. The whole world was watching as Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee was to be bestowed DLitt and it was not a spontaneous incident, but a deliberate attempt by ugly forces to disrupt the event.”

480,['30/01/2020'],Clash over CAA bandh kills two in Murshidabad,"This story is from January 30, 2020

Behrampore: A clash between two groups — both opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act but differing over whether to enforce a protest bandh — claimed two lives in Murshidabad ’s Jalangi on Wednesday.

One of the dead was the 62-year-old imam of a local mosque, Anarul Islam, who was hit by a bullet while returning home after namaz. The other victim was 17-year-old migrant labourer Sheikh Salauddin, who returned home barely 10 days ago. Both were rushed to Murshidabad Medical College and Hospital but declared dead on arrival.

The clash, police said, broke out between bandh enforcers and opponents at Jalangi’s Sahebnagar. Trinamool leaders said they opposed the bandh as it was Saraswati Puja. “We, too, are against the new citizenship law but we do not want people to be inconvenienced,” Murshidabad district Trinamool president Abu Taher Khan said, explaining why the local Trinamool unit opposed the bandh.

The bandh call, officials said, was given by the Nabajagaran Mancha (comprising supporters of a host of political parties). Nabajagaran Mancha executive committee member Emdadul Mandal said it was a “pre-announced bandh” and the violence was “instigated to foil it”.

Trinamool Jalangi North president Tahiruddin Mandal, however, said the violence was the “work of bandh supporters”.

Wednesday’s clash started after bandh opponents reached the Sahebnagar market after getting information that bandh supporters were forcing a shutdown. The rival groups fired and hurled bombs at each other, witnesses said. Both victims were said to have succumbed to bullet wounds. Bandh supporters Mijanur Rahaman and Alauddin Biswas and Trinamool worker Mantu Sheikh were admitted to MMCH with bullet injuries.

The Sahebnagar neighbourhood, where the clash occurred, remained tense for some time. Vehicles did not ply along the Sagarpara-Sheikhpara State Highway and Dhanirampur-Bhaduriapara Road after the clash, prompting police to patrol the area. “We are investigating who all were behind the clash. We have detained five persons. A police picket is in the area to prevent further trouble,” deputy inspector-general Mukesh Kumar said.

Anarul’s son, Sahabul, said his dad was an imam and avoided politics. “He went to conduct namaz and was returning home after locking the mosque gates. What was his fault?” he asked.

Salauddin’s dad said his son was not into politics but had decided to join the bandh call as he felt it was a “non-political platform” to oppose the National Register of Citizens.
