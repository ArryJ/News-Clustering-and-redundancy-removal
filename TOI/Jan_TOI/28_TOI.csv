0,['28/01/2020'],maradu movie: Dharmajan Bolgatty : I had to wait a decade to play a central role,"From his signature expressions to hilarious repartees, actor Dharmajan Bolgatty is the go-to comedian in Malayalam films these days. The actor who has completed a decade in films is much loved for his roles as a sidekick in films and as the partner in crime of Ramesh Pisharody in stage shows and comic skits.This year, however, marks a change in his career as Dharmajan will be playing a serious and central role in Maradu 357 , directed by Kannan Thamarakulam . In his words, it will mark a kind of shift from his brand of comedy and that has already got him excited. In a free-wheeling chat, Dharmajan opens up about his new projects, his cameo in Bigg Boss Malayalam 2, his family and more.It has taken me 10 years to get a character role. It’s not that I have never wanted it, but I got a chance only now. We can perform such a role when we are offered such a script. I have been tagged as a comedian and have been receiving humour-oriented roles in my career so far. Also, the wait was for a person who had the courage to back a film in such a genre with me. I have played sidekicks and foolish friends of protagonists, but this is the first time I am getting to do a central character and that too of a serious nature. I hope the film will mark a change in my career. For this film, they wanted the actor in Dharmajan and nothing more.I will be playing a security officer of a flat. His name is Mani and has only one arm. He lives with his old mother but says, ‘Enikku vanamutte bhandhukal aanu (I have relatives till the sky)’ as he sees the residents of the flat as his extended familyThe demolition of highrise buildings was there only in foreign countries as they used to de-commission timeworn buildings.The film’s script is written by Dinesh Pallath and it tells the story of the people who lived in those flats in Maradu that were demolished and those who worked in them as sweepers and other staff including Mani. It wasn’t just the elite, the flat also accommodated middle-income families who had invested their entire savings to own a house. For them, owning a flat was like the happiness we get while eating a biryani instead of a regular meal.Personally, I have also lived in a flat complex for a year, so I know how sentimental one can be when you are forced to leave. More than a film, I also have some personal sentiments attached to the script. I felt happy when Dinesh added my inputs and experience in the script when we were discussing it.For the character, I have grown a beard and moustache. I am now 43 years old and it’s the first time that I am seeing my face with a beard. I will be using the look for my future projects too.Yes, it was a short visit, for a day as a guest. It is a whole different world inside the house as there is no clock or calendar to check the time or date. I know most of the participants except Reshma, Sujo and Rajith sir. Pashanam Shaji, Manju, Thesni and Parikutty had told me about being part of the show. I know many of them personally and they are doing well in the show.To be frank, the participants are a mix of elite and middle-class people. I entered the show at 7 pm and came out the next afternoon. It was very different for me as my day starts with expecting the newspaper boy to turn up with the daily. It has become my habit to read the newspaper while going to the toilet, but at Bigg Boss House I had to read the guidelines sheet instead (laughs). But all our habits will change if we have to live in the Bigg Boss house as it is such a place.From my experience and watching the show, I feel Fukru is the best contestant. Many of them are acting, but I felt Fukru was genuine.As part of the promotion works of my film Margamkali, I had met a group of talented Tik Tok artistes including Fukru. I had clicked a few selfies with them. My daughter Vyga who was checking the photos on my phone got very excited seeing his snap as she is a fan. I wondered why she was so happy seeing the face of a Tik Tok artiste as opposed to taking pictures with prominent actors like Dulquer, Mammukka and more. I had to call Fukru at 10.30 pm as Vyga kept insisting that I make her talk to him. Vyga also performs Tik Tok videos and when she received appreciative messages from Fukru, I got to see her beam. So, I know him well now.I am small, but my name is big. I have always thought about that while I was a kid as to why my father named me thus. In school, I had this big name which was quite contrary to my appearance and height. My teachers used to mispronounce it as Dhananjayan or Dharmarajan. But when I did mimicry and acting, it became a unique name and my identity too. Now, I like it when people call me Dharmu, Dharman , Bolgatty et al.Apart from Maradu 357, I play a serious role in the film Voter too. It’s about an illiterate layman named Gopi, who resides in this secluded island. His views on democracy and life on the island forms the subject of the film. Things change when a group of officials including presiding officers comes to the island to get his vote. It is a national subject and the film is directed by debutant Sagar.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73664987,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-3186720/73664987.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/dharmajan-bolgatty-i-had-to-wait-a-decade-to-play-a-central-role/articleshow/73662771.cms

2,['28/01/2020'],No starry tantrums make social media celebs a hit at city college fests,"No-frills attitude

Easier to connect with and relate to

They speak the millennial lingo

Fit in the college fest budget

Greater social media reach

Given that digital media consumption has seen a massive surge over the past decade, it’s no wonder that artistes who have a huge fan following on social media platforms are among the most sought-after offline too. The growing popularity of YouTubers, DJs, stand-up comics as well as reality TV stars on college campuses attest to this new trend. These social media celebrities are now judging competitions at city colleges, while some also perform during events. What’s making them such a rage among youngsters?The popularity of these celebs on social media automatically translates to them having a bigger influence on the young demographic, says Ushua Prashant, a student of Mount Carmel College. “The audience at college fests mostly comprise those under the age of 22. Again, it’s the same age group that spends most of their leisure time on social media, watching these celebs’ videos or browsing through their pictures. It, thus, makes sense to invite them for campus events, because many students look up to them,” explains Ushua.“If the artiste happens to be from Bengaluru or from the same college, it’s a plus point. Some of these social media celebs may still have friends or acquaintances on campus. This makes it easier for us to get access to them. And when we approach them, they oblige without much persuasion,” says Ushua. Students find many of these artistes just like themselves. “Unlike film stars, who often need elaborate security that we cannot afford, social media celebs don’t make too many demands when we invite them to be part of our college fests,” says Vismitha Simha, an organising committee core member at Jain (deemed-to-be) University, Centre for Management Studies.According to student organisers, famous online artistes help create the right amount of buzz around college fests. “Collaborating with social media celebs also means more participation and footfalls at our events,” says Vismitha. DJs and stand-up comedians performing at fests is an added advantage. “We have had comedians like Aravind SA, Papa CJ and Saurabh Pant taking the stage at our cultural events earlier. Interactive shows are a big hit among students, particularly when comics crack those classroom jokes. DJs also have a similar influence on young crowd,” says Rebecca D’Silva, cultural secretary at RV College of Engineering.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73666731,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-179414/73666731.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/no-starry-tantrums-make-social-media-celebs-a-hit-at-city-college-fests/articleshow/73666731.cms

8,['28/01/2020'],Your trade-off for digital convenience: no privacy,"Are you addicted to connecting with friends online and playing games on social media that analyse your personality? Do you love to browse through e-commerce websites and are surprised to see related ads popping up on your social media news feed and phone browser? Ever wondered why these ads make it to your social media feed so soon? Here’s the thing; in the digital world, you are being watched all the time. Whether you like it or not, your online activities are being tracked. But, are there ways to safeguard your privacy? As the world observes Data Privacy Day on January 28, we talk to experts and find ways to limit your digital footprint and protect it from being misused.The first step to ensure a safe browsing experience is to be wary of what to download and what not to. “Downloading unknown apps and taking quirky psychological tests on social media puts your personal information at risk. People take random quizzes to find out how rich they’ll be when they are older or how they’ll look at a certain age. These tests serve as a psychological record of you for social media companies,” says Srinivas Kodali, an independent researcher on data and cybersecurity. A digital security expert from Delhi says, “Malicious apps downloaded on your phone can access your messages and can read your one time passwords (OTPs) too. Even though the digital era makes life convenient, the privacy of your data depends on how you use these apps.” He adds, “It is a trade-off for the convenience you enjoy by using these apps.”Even trusted apps, that have a million downloads to their credit, ask for permissions that they do not need. “For instance, there are photo editing apps and e-commerce related apps that ask for permission to view contacts and messages. One must always question why an app needs a certain permission, does it really require access to your messages and contact list to function? It is advisable to avoid downloading apps that ask for too much access,” says techpreneur Sandeep Sarma.Open-source softwares not only provide a better browsing experience, but are also deemed to be safer, state experts. “It makes sense to find open-source alternatives to major software systems, as they address legal and ethical issues from a consumer’s perspective, which makes them safe and easy to use. One can search for these alternatives online,” says Srinivas.“Even if you do need to use WiFi, say, at a café or another unknown location, avoid logging on to your personal online banking websites, personal emails or utility-based apps when you are using a network that you are not familiar with. Unsecured networks may put vital information at risk. Be extra wary if a network provides you an offer that is too good to be true,” advises Vijay Raj, a cyber security risk evangelist.As browsers track all your information and maintain a specific record of internet users, experts advise using privacy add-ons and extensions that can block access from other online software. “Privacy extensions and add-ons not only protect us from attacks by hackers, but also block ads that show up while browsing. Several privacy add-ons block trackers too,” says Vijay.If you have resorted to using the same login ID and password for all your accounts in your effort to remember them easily, you are putting your personal information at risk. “In case of a security breach on even one of your accounts, a hacker can access your other accounts and steal data,” explains Srinivas.- Avoid using an unknown free app, especially one that has very few downloads.- Always read the reviews for an app beforedownloading it.- Find out the origin of the app. It’s important to know where it was developed. Free apps designed in countries that have earlier been in news for data theft should, anyway, raise an alarm.- Don’t install any app through links received in your email or SMS that also offer prize money. Clicking those links often exposes you to maliciousmalware and can gain access to your system.- Be alert while downloading apps. For example, a gaming app shouldn’t ask for your location. Finance-related apps shouldn’t ask for access to your camera. Be mindful of the permissions you give.- Declutter your phone by removing apps that you don’t use on a regular basis.- Install apps from official app stores.- Use the right browsers or VPN.- Turn off location services when not required or if you don’t want your phone to save or track your timeline.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73670023,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1462253/73670023.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/your-trade-off-for-digital-convenience-no-privacy/articleshow/73670023.cms

Panaji: “Girls are a burden and meant to get married, cook food, take care of their husband, children, and live a burdened life. I want to change that mindset of people in India,” said India’s first female Olympic medallist Karnam Malleswari during the opening session of the 13th DD Kosambi Festival of Ideas at Kala Academy on Monday.

A mother of two, Malleswari also stressed that parents need to allow kids to grow and let them choose what they want to be.

When asked if it is fair to be sports oriented as not everyone can be the next Virat Kohli or Sachin Tendulkar , she replied, ""Can everyone be an IAS officer, engineer or a doctor? No. Sports brings self-belief, improves health, boosts confidence and purpose in one's life. When I started training village girls at my academy, they couldn't look up. After a year, they are confident and can beat boys. That's what sports does to you,"" said the 44-year-old weightlifter.

“Education is important but if you have a champion in you, bring it out. I studied and got a degree in MBA and honorary doctorate after I retired. I had to win the medal first and then study,” she told the audience.

Malleshwari also said that it was hours and hours of hard work, which got her the Olympic bronze medal. ""I see today's kids lift 40kg and put it on social media and get many likes. Going by this, had there been social media during our time, we would have been superstars. But, that’s not how it works. We wrestled with iron for 12 hours a day. It was insane training, but only through such training you can succeed at the Olympic level,"" she said.

Malleshwari, who settled for a bronze in the 69kg weight category, losing by 2.5kg in Sydney to China’s Lin Weining and Hungary’s Erzsebet Markus, rues the missed opportunity. ""Not a single day goes by when I don't think of it. I can't rest on my laurels. People often ask me why I continue to train despite achieving so much? I want to see my players win a gold medal. No one was there to teach us, we learnt everything on our own. I have an experience of 14 years at the international level, which I want to share with the next generation, especially girls,"" she said.

Praising the central government's support for sports, Malleshwari revealed that they had to beg for private sponsors in order to participate in important tournaments and championships. ""We had to beg to the government, but it always fell on deaf ears. Now, the government is providing ample support. I got Rs 6 lakh for winning the medal at Sydney. Today, winners get crores of rupees. I did everything on my own to get land and start an academy. The current government has come forward and gave me Rs 5 crore for the academy. I want to make it the world's best weightlifting centre,” she said.

Focusing on Goa, she said, “I see tremendous potential here. I had a hard life and can relate to you in Goa. Whoever is willing to become a weightlifter, my doors will be open for you and it would be fantastic to have few from Goa.”

11,['28/01/2020'],Union tourism minister toying with idea of Geo- tourism in Narmada valley,"This story is from January 28, 2020

BHOPAL: The Union ministry of tourism is working on projects to develop a Geo tourism circuit in Mahakaushal region of Narmada valley . With some of the best tiger reserves of the world within a 200-km radius around Jabalpur , it also has the Lamheta formation or Intertrappean beds, Bhedaghat - the famous marble rocks - and Ghughva fossil national park in the neighbouring Dindori disrict.

Union minister of tourism Prahalad Patel said, “These places are never projected as they should have been showcased on the world stage of tourism.”

Talking exclusively with TOI, Patel said that ""the ministry is working on a concept on how Narmada valley can be a focus area of tourism”.

An MP from Damoh in Bundelkhand, Prahalad Patel belongs to Narsighpur district — situated on the banks of river Narmada. The place is known for holding the Narmada parikrama (circumambulation) a number of times.

Referring to Jabalpur, he said, “If we consider Jabalpur as the centre point, no place in the world has seen so much of geological change, we can have a Geo park in Jabalpur. There is no Geo park in the country.”

“Lamheta formation is the oldest among the three, and 18 out of 27 dinosaur fossils are found here. Bhedaghat is a part of Narmada River Valley, which has very old rocks of pre-historic time. About 100 km away from Jabalpur is located the Ghughva fossil national park in Dindori district ,” he explained.

There are numerous plant, leaf, fruit, seed, and shell fossils that are found in Ghughva, some of them date as far back as 65 million years.

“Though these geological hotspots are known to the world, we have not focused on them,” Patel said, adding, “I don’t blame any one for this.”

He said, “Concept pe kaam chal rahaa hai ki Narmada valley ko, develop ho saken.. sari usi k kinare.. poori valley ko promote karna hai.. .. tourism ko sirf hotel mein raat bitana nahi hai. (Working on concept to develop tourism activities in Narmada valley. The whole valley needs to be promoted, spending one night in a hotel doesn’t mean tourism)”

Amid the changing perception of tourism, he said Narmada valley fulfils all expectations of tourists. “As and when it is done (conceptualization and implementation), we will let you know.”

12,['28/01/2020'],"Government to review laws and ""reshape"" existing schemes to check crime against women","This story is from January 28, 2020

Union minister Smriti Irani (File photo)

NEW DELHI: In the backdrop of the National Crime Record Bureau 2018 data showing rise in crime against women and children despite so many laws and schemes, the WCD ministry has set in motion the process for steering a review of the “multitude of legislations” dealing with women. This has been done to weed out overlapping provisions and identify and rework components that are “toothless” in terms of impacts during implementation.

The relevance of women related laws in keeping with the present day challenges will be assessed. Also states have been asked to carry out a “situational analysis” of laws, schemes and shelter homes for women and children.

Learning from the Muzzaffarpur shelter home case where a social audit by Tata Institute of Social Sciences helped bring to light the horrific cases of abuse, it is learnt from reliable sources, that the ministry will now be creating a database of organisations that can be assigned similar audits across states from time to time. Minister for women and child development Smriti Irani has also asked the ministry to work on developing an SOP and guidelines for social audits. Irani has sought focus on “reshaping and reworking” the existing framework to strengthen it.

It is also proposed to study and strengthen the investigation process under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act to make it more child friendly. These and many more suggestions were shared at a national consultation on ""redefining safety, security and welfare of women and children-role of Institutions.""

It is learnt from sources that the consultation is the first step towards redefining many things in the system including roles of institutions. For instance, the meeting dwelled on the need to emphasise that putting children in institutional care should not be the first option and there should be greater focus on foster care and restoration of the child in the family.

The consultation was attended by senior officials from the ministry, representatives from NCW , NCPCR, and renowned lawyers, doctors and experts from the voluntary sector working in institutions with children and women.

As per NCRB in the year 2018, approximately 3.78 lakh cases of crimes against women have been reported. This is an increase over previous years as in 2017, there were 3.59 lakh cases and in 2016 the cases registered were 3.38 lakh. Majority of the cases relate to cruelty by husband and his relatives (1.04 lakh), assault on women to outrage her modesty (90,000), POCSO cases (nearly 40,000), kidnapping and abduction (75,000), rape (34,000) and dowry cases (13,000). Human trafficking and cyber crime against women are also other notable crimes against women.

The confident young actress is excited to step into the industry and see her dream come true. In a candid chat with BT, she talks about the nepotism debate, stepping on the silver screen, the relationship she shares with her mother, Pooja Bedi , and more. Excerpts:It is all so magical! It’s surreal to see yourself on big screen. When I saw the film for the first time, I told myself that I would need some time to process this. I enjoyed watching myself on big screen so much that I have already seen the film thrice!I have been prepping for the last four years. For two years, I studied direction and acting in New York. When I returned to Mumbai, I took training in acting, diction, gymnastics, Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) and dancing, which included forms like contemporary, Bollywood, Kathak, etc.Saif is very smart and witty. You can talk to him about anything and everything. He has been very supportive and is a very giving actor. At the time of my solo shots, he would be there on the set to give me cues to better my performance. The first time I faced the camera for this film, it was for a scene with him. It was a dialogue-heavy, seven-page long scene, which was a six-minute shot. Nitin sir (Kakkar, director) asked me to do it in a single, continuous shot. It was a crucial scene where I reveal that I am Saif’s daughter. I was nervous, but it went off smoothly without rehearsing the scene with Saif. The two of us shared a great comfort level.I made a conscious decision to not involve my family members too much in my film journey. Family members tend to get emotional. So, I felt it is better not to mix the two. I told my mother right at the beginning that I would only reach out to her for advice. I am happy that she understood and supported me. Likewise, I go and seek my nana’s (Kabir Bedi) opinion, too. I like making my own decisions. I remember showing my nana my acting videos from my classes, and he would give his perspective on them. I grew extremely close to my nana during my process of becoming an actress.She was impressed. She has seen me slog for 14 hours straight, hopping from one class to another. She once told me about how she got her first film. She said that she was 10 minutes late for a meeting, and so she called the director to inform him about the delay and apologise for it. He was really surprised. He was so impressed with her sense of discipline that he cast her in the film without a second thought. That was the time when actors used to come on sets many hours late. Bollywood has changed so much since then. There are so many female-centric films today, and everything is content-driven. It’s a competitive world out there, and everyone is well prepared. If you are not up to the mark then someone else, who is more prepared, will take your place. Everyone is so dispensable now. I firmly believe ki agar kaam karoge toh kaam milega. I love competition; it keeps everyone on their toes and motivated. You see your contemporaries and learn from their achievements and mistakes, too. It’s interesting to see the paths each one (contemporaries) takes. Alia Bhatt and Priyanka Chopra (Jonas) have inspired me a lot. They are so talented and do such diverse work.No, at that point of time, I wanted to be a director and not an actor. So, it had nothing to do with that. In fact, I went to New York to study direction, but later I changed my mind and enrolled in acting classes. When I came back to India and started training here, I was almost disconnected from social media. I lost interest in it. Now that I am an actress, I am making an effort to get back and be more active on social media. However, it is difficult to get back into it once you’ve cut it out of your life. I know it is important, but I don’t take it too seriously.Of course! I expected these questions to come my way. However, I feel it’s great that a subject like this is being talked about. It is a reality, and there is no need to run away from it. Addressing it sensitively and acknowledging it is the most important part. For me, no matter what people say, I am still going to act. I am going to do what I love. Hopefully, one day I will be good enough and no one will consider me a product of nepotism. Look at actors like Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor... people don’t look at them as privileged star kids, because they are so good at what they do. Today, we see a lot of talent on the rise in Bollywood. We have star kids coming in, plus, there are talented actors from outside the industry, who are getting great opportunities, too. With more talent around, there are better opportunities and more films are being made.My mother allowed me to be my own person. She encouraged me to have an opinion and voice it loud and clear. My mother and I are rarely on the same page, and that makes for good conversations and debates. We look at things differently. I share a great equation with my father (Farhan Furniturewala), too. Both my parents have been there for me constantly and consistently. My dad is extremely excited ever since I told him that I wanted to get into movies. He used to send me newspaper clippings about films under pre-production and ask me to audition for them. Ever since I came back from New York, I spent a lot more time with him. He knows nothing about movies (laughs!). My mother lives in Goa now, while my brother Omar is in Los Angeles, where he is studying business management. Since I live alone in Mumbai, I tend to see my father a lot more. I share a great equation with my stepmother (Laila) and stepbrother Zaan. I hate calling him my stepbrother; he is my brother. He is just four years old and is very cute. I also share a good equation with my mom’s partner (Maneck Contractor). He, too, is excited about my film debut. A few days ago, we went to a multiplex to watch a movie, and when we saw a poster of Jawaani Jaaneman, we all started clicking pictures with it.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73665981,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-55872/73665981.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/alaya-f-i-made-a-conscious-decision-to-not-involve-my-family-members-too-much-in-my-film-journey/articleshow/73664684.cms

With the movie currently playing in cinemas, Bhushan and Varun discuss the road ahead. Excerpts:Now that the film is out, I can tell you that Remo sir and I wanted to make it for a very long time. An international studio that was expected to back it, stopped its movie production business and our dream was pushed onto the backburner. Bhushanji’s entry on the scene just rebooted our energies. With his expertise, he backed this film phenomenally. He ensured we didn’t compromise on anything.This is a musical franchise that I wanted to have on T-Series’ repertoire for a long time. When Remo made ABCD, I told him that he should have partnered with me on it. He hadn’t approached me because my company at that time was barely making movies. ABCD 2 got us talking again, but we couldn’t partner. This time around, things fell into place.I wanted to explore dance as a genre because we have developed action, comedy, thriller, slice-of-life and family drama as genres, but not dance. I’ve always believed that dance and music can be used effectively to tell a story. 'Street Dancer 3D' proves that point.In our film, the screenplay progresses with songs. We don’t have the tracks just because they sounded like potential hits. We couldn’t have asked for a better and more complete album.With the passage of time, I don’t know how often and for how long I will be able to lead the cast of this franchise. It’s a youth-centric franchise and it should be moulded to suit the patterns of the youth viewership. Even if I am not acting in this franchise, I probably will back it with Bhushanji as a producer. As for working together, Remo sir, he and I have discussed something and we’re quite excited about it.I agree with Varun that it’s a youth franchise and its stories can be crafted in so many ways to appeal to the young audience. Apart from Varun, Tiger Shroff is the only other person I see fitting into this franchise. About working with Varun, I’ve realised that he can be a great producer. He’s been a strong and reliable support for me on this film.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73666558,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-74632/73666558.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/varun-dhawan-bhushan-kumar-backing-street-dancer-3d-rebooted-our-energies/articleshow/73666586.cms

Many Indian students still stuck in Wuhan

NEW DELHI: India will request China for a possible evacuation of over 250 Indians from Wuhan , the government said after a review meeting by the cabinet secretary to evaluate the situation arising out of the new coronavirus outbreak in the neighbouring country.“It was decided that steps may be taken to prepare for possible evacuation of Indian nationals in Wuhan. Accordingly, the ministry of external affairs will make a request to the Chinese authorities,” the government said. Ministries of civil aviation and health will make arrangements for transport and quarantine facilities, respectively. Air India is preparing to operate a special flight on its Boeing 747 from Mumbai to Wuhan to fly out Indians from there. While the flight was scheduled to depart at 5pm on Monday , the airline was awaiting clearances from various places, including the airport in Wuhan, to operate the special flight. “We are in a state of preparedness. Our crew, medical teams and supplies are ready for the flight. But Wuhan is in a state of lockdown and services there are hit.There is the issue of how people will reach the airport. All these issues are being sorted out with the help of the Indian embassy. As soon as we get all the clearances, we will operate the special flight,” said a source.Many Indians, mostly medical students, are stuck in Wuhan — the epicentre of the new China virus – triggering concern for Indian authorities. With the number of cases increasing rapidly and amid mounting scare of a wider outbreak, Chinese authorities sealed Wuhan along with 12 other cities last week to stop the virus from spreading. The death toll climbed to 80 with 2,744 confirmed cases. The virus has now also spread to other countries with cases reported from the US, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Nepal.On Monday, cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba chaired a high-level review meeting to assess India’s preparedness to deal with coronavirus. The meeting decided to take a raft of precautionary measures, including the screening of people at international ports having traffic from China as well as at the integrated check-posts across the Nepal border.The meeting chaired by Gauba also decided that the civil aviation ministry will issue instructions to airlines for managing and notifying anybody reporting illness on all flights with direct or indirect connectivity to China. Officials said the civil aviation ministry will also ask the airlines to make in-flight announcements and distribute “health cards” to all flights with direct or indirect connectivity to China. The health ministry also held a meeting earlier on Monday with chief secretaries to review the preparedness in five states having border with Nepal.In Video: Coronavirus outbreak: Special Air India plane ready to fly out Indians trapped in Wuhan",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73677706,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-823484,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/special-air-india-plane-ready-to-get-out-indians-trapped-in-wuhan/articleshow/73677671.cms
23,['28/01/2020'],"ED traces ‘suspicious’ flow in PFI accounts, claims it’s funding anti-CAA agitation","People protest against CAA (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate is probing a series of financial transactions involving Popular Front of India (PFI) as part of a widening probe into the alleged role of the controversial Islamist outfit in fanning anti-CAA protests.A preliminary probe done by the anti-money laundering agency has established a suspicious pattern of deposits into and withdrawal of money from PFI’s accounts. The ED has claimed that Rs 1.04 crore was deposited in 10 accounts of PFI and five belonging to another entity, Rehab India Foundation , between December 4 last year and January 6 when protests against the change in the citizenship law were most intense in UP and elsewhere. The period saw Rs 1.34 crore being withdrawn from the accounts in multiple small transactions: ranging from Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000, between December 4 and January 6.ED sources said the transactions were deliberately kept small to dodge suspicion, with PFI’s bank accounts witnessing as many as 80-90 withdrawals in small amounts on a single day.The CAA dimension is part of a larger focus that extends to the source of Rs 120 crore credited into PFI’s bank accounts. The money was deposited in small instalments through ATMs and mobile wallets in what the ED suspects to be an effort to conceal the identity of the depositors. The money deposited was immediately taken out, again in small amounts, leaving a very nominal balance in the accounts.A scrutiny of transactions from PFI’s account in Syndicate Bank’s Nehru Place branch in New Delhi showed multiple cash deposits totalling Rs 41.5 crore from 27 accounts in the districts of Hapur, Shamli, Dasna and Bijnor in western UP, as well as Bahraich.The PFI denied the allegations with its general secretary M Muhammed Ali Jinnah saying the claims were absurd and a face-saving act by the Uttar Pradesh police.These details are part of a report the ED submitted to the home ministry on Sunday evening. The ministry is seized of a recommendation by the UP government to declare the PFI unlawful in the light of its alleged role in inciting violence in the state during the anti-CAA agitation. The ED’s preliminary report will serve to reinforce UP’s demand to declare the PFI unlawful.“Withdrawal of money from the bank accounts of PFI and its related entities has direct correlation with a violent demonstration against the CAA. The transaction dates in the 15 bank accounts of the PFI also match the dates of violence. This draws a clear connection between the violent protests and PFI,” the ED said in its report to the MHA.The report also mentioned a payment of Rs 1.17 crore made by PFI to Jothi group, a plastic making firm. “Since PFI and the company are working in two different areas, the nature and reason for this transaction is under investigation. A transaction of Rs 20 lakh between Rehab India Foundation and another firm is also under the scanner,” it added.The report also mentioned a payment of Rs 3.1 lakh to a terror accused named Abdul Samad who was arrested two weeks ago by Delhi Police’s special cell. Investigation by the special cell, sources claimed, found that Samad was associated with PFI and was inspired by the Islamic State’s objective of establishing a global Caliphate.The UP government’s allegations, along with the ED’s preliminary findings into “dubious” sources of PFI’s funds, mark yet another evidence of the growing reach of the hardcore Islamist outfit outside south India where it was confined until a few years ago. Of those arrested by UP police for violence against the new citizenship law, 25 allegedly belong to PFI.The PFI has been under the scanner of intelligence agencies and the National Investigation Agency for three years now. The outfit was formed in 2006 as a successor to the fundamentalist outfit National Democratic Front (NDF) which was banned for its alleged involvement in acts of terror. The agencies have informed the government and police forces that the federation was an offshoot of Students Islamic Movement of India , another outlawed Islamist outfit which agencies have accused of being the feeder for recruits to terrorist groups like Indian Mujahideen .",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73678022,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1158208,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-traces-suspicious-flow-in-pfi-accounts-claims-its-funding-anti-caa-agitation/articleshow/73678008.cms

First-time & repeat buyers drive phone demand in India

CHENNAI: The aggressive expansion of Chinese smartphone-makers in India has helped the country dethrone the US to become the second-largest smartphone market in the world.India is now next only to global leader China in terms of smartphone units shipped. Shipping around 158 million smartphones in 2019, India beat US shipments of 153 million, shows recent data from Counterpoint Research .The strategy of Chinese brands to introduce flagship-grade features at attractive price points to capture India’s new smartphone users helped the surge, along with growth of e-commerce making mobiles more accessible to the population, Counterpoint’s analysis noted. Chinese brands — comprising Xiaomi , Vivo, OnePlus and others — together held a record 72% share of the Indian market in 2019 compared to 60% a year ago.With shipments of almost 395 million in 2019, China’s smartphone industry is witnessing a decline, while Indian smartphone sector grew 7% year-on-year in 2019.However, the India smartphone market growth was in single-digits for the first time on an annual basis as slowdown marginally impacted the industry, which grew 10% in 2018. “The US is a mature smartphone market driven by users looking to upgrade, which has slowed as users there are holding flagships for a longer period of time,” Tarun Pathak, associate director, Counterpoint Research, told TOI. In contrast, Indian demand is coming from both first-time and repeat buyers, and is still under-penetrated relative to the US, he adds.Pathak estimates it will take India at least four to five years to close the gap with China. “There is a good mix of second-hand or refurbished phones , which take some share [away] from new phone demand in India, making it difficult to surpass China,” he said.Only around 55% of India’s mobile phone subscribers are on the 4G network, shows Counterpoint data, and as more people migrate from feature phones to smartphones, the demand will rise.

NEW DELHI/ GUWAHATI: A tripartite accord signed on Monday between the Centre, Assam government and Bodo representatives, including all factions of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) that has waged a violent struggle, holds out prospects for peace with all sides reaffirming faith in Assam’s territorial integrity.The pact, described as “historic” by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, provides for setting up of a commission to reconstitute the Bodo Territorial Areas District (BTAD) by including new Bodo-dominated villages contiguous to the existing BTAD area and excluding villages with a predominantly non-tribal population. BTAD will be rechristened as Bodo Territorial Region. Bodo language will be notified as an associate official language in Assam.Over 1,500 NDFB cadres will shun the path of violence, surrender arms coinciding with Mahatma Gandhi’s death anniversary on January 30 and disband their armed organisations within the next one month. A Rs 5-lakh compensation is being offered to the kin of Bodo rebels martyred in their violent struggle. The surrendered cadres too will get a rehabilitation package. This is the third Bodo agreement to date, but seen as viable due to armed factions agreeing to be party to the settlement.Cases against NDFB cadres involving non-heinous crimes will be withdrawn by the Assam government, while cases involving more serious offences will be reviewed on a case-to-case basis. The total number of assembly seats in BTC will go up to 60 from 40, though this will be relevant only from 2026 assembly polls.It has been agreed that a Rs 1,500 crore economic package shall be released over the next three years for Bodo areas, with the Centre and Assam government contributing equal measure. Deputy commissioners and SPs of districts within BTAD will be posted in consultation with BTAD chief executive member.Signatories to the accord — signed in the presence of home minister Amit Shah , Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma — included Bodo Territorial Council (BTC) chief executive member Hagrama Mohilary , representatives of All Bodo Students’ Union (ABSU), United Boro People Organisation (UBPO) and leaders of NDFB factions headed by Gobinda Basumatary, Dhirendra Boro, Ranjan Daimary and B Saoraigwra.In a series of tweets after signing of the accord, Modi said: “Bodo Accord inked today (Monday) stands out for many reasons. It successfully brings together leading stakeholders under one framework. Those who were previously associated with armed resistance groups will now be entering the mainstream and contributing to our nation’s progress”.Shah said: “This agreement will facilitate all-round development of the Bodo areas, their language and culture will be protected without compromising the territorial integrity of Assam”. He added success of the latest Bodo agreement, the third in 27 years, was guaranteed as all Bodo outfits were on board.”The violent struggle for sovereignty, and then a separate state of Bodoland, spanning past five decades, has claimed over 4,000 lives. The first accord with All Bodo Students’ Union was signed in 1993 leading to the creation of Bodoland Autonomous Council with limited political powers. It, however, failed.The second one was with Bodo Liberation Tigers (a rebel group) in 2003 under which the Bodoland Territorial Council was established to administer four districts — Chirang, Kokrajhar, Baska and Udalguri (called Bodoland Territorial Area District) — located on the northern banks of Brahmaputra. But under the new accord, the area will now be called Bodoland Territorial Region with more administrative, legislative, executive and financial powers.In Video: HM Amit Shah signs agreement with banned Bodo group",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73678628,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-896625,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bodo-outfits-drop-demand-for-separate-state-sign-historic-pact/articleshow/73678471.cms
27,['28/01/2020'],"Gloves off, CM Arvind Kejriwal and Amit Shah attack each other over Shaheen Bagh","This story is from January 28, 2020

Union minister Amit Shah and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal went on the offensive on the Shaheen Bagh issue on Monday, accusing BJP of deliberately not getting the road opened. Addressing a press conference, the chief minister said: “BJP does not want to get the road — closed due to the protest — opened. Holding press conferences will not lead to improvement in law and order in Delhi. Law and order can improve with efforts. We can teach you how to work. We know how to work and they only know how to hold press conferences and do dirty politics.”

Kejriwal seemed to have overcome his initial hesitation in discussion the issue, faced with BJP’s aggressive campaigning. He said the road, affected by the protest against Citizenship Amendment Act, will be opened on February 9, a day after polling is held for the assembly elections. The closure is causing huge inconvenience to commuters.

It was last week after deputy CM Manish Sisodia said on a TV channel that he stands with the Shaheen Bagh protesters that BJP began attacking him and Kejriwal. Party spokesperson Sambit Patra called AAP an anti-Hindu party while Hari Nagar candidate Tajinder Singh Bagga said BJP stands with India and AAP with Shaheen Bagh protesters.

Union home minister Amit Shah escalated the attack on Monday by daring Kejriwal to clear his stand on the Shaheen Bagh protests and explain whether he was in favour of the protesters.

Later, on Twitter, Kejriwal responded to Shah who had also sought his stand on JNU student Sharjeel Imam, who has been booked for his speeches. “Sharjeel talked about cutting off Assam from the country. This is serious. You are the home minister of the country. Your statement is low level of politics. It is your responsibility to get him arrested. Two days have passed since he made the remarks. Why are you not arresting him? What is your helplessness? Or do you have to do more dirtier politics?” Kejriwal asked on Twitter.

“I am disappointed with the dirty politics of BJP on the issue,” he said at the press conference. “The road is closed and it is causing inconvenience to a large number of people. School children and ambulances are facing obstruction. Travelling (through Kalindi Kunj ) that usually took 30-40 minutes is taking two-and-a-half to three hours. “I can give it in writing that...the road will open on February 9.”

The chief minister said he had repeatedly observed that Constitution guarantees the right to protest to every citizen but it should not result in inconvenience to the common man. “Why is the BJP led central government, which is responsible for law and order, not solving this problem,” asked Kejriwal. He said that instead of holding a press conference, union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad should have visited Shaheen Bagh and talked to the protesters to get the road opened. He urged Shah and other BJP leaders to also visit Shaheen Bagh and do the job.

30,['28/01/2020'],"Pakistan news: Hindu girl abducted from wedding venue, converted, married off in Pakistan","AMRITSAR: A teenaged Hindu bride from Pakistan 's Sindh province was allegedly kidnapped from the venue of her wedding a few days ago, converted and married off to a Muslim man by the time police responded to her parents' complaint and traced her to Karachi.Ravi Dawani, general secretary of the All Pakistan Hindu Panchayat, told TOI on Monday that it was the third instance in less than two weeks of Hindu girls being targeted, including a 15-year-old from Sindh who was kidnapped on January 15 and converted to Islam.“The bride from Hala in Matiari district of Sindh was converted to Islam at Banoria in Karachi and married off to one Shahrukh Memon,” Dawani said.He said the Hindu panchayat helped the girl’s family approach the police, who sent a team to Karachi to bring her back to Sindh. She was produced in a Hala court on Monday, but it wasn't immediately known whether action had been ordered against those accused of kidnapping her.In the case of the 15-year-old, a resident of Jacobabad district, a court has directed the police to get an ossification test done to confirm her age.Dawani said a 25-year-old woman from Kot Gulam Mohammad town of Mirpur Khas district had also been whisked away from her home four days ago and converted to Islam. She is now married to a Muslim man identified as Ghulam Mustafa. “We are still to verify whether the woman got married to Mustafa against her wishes,"" Dawani said.National assembly member Ramesh Kumar Vankwani , who is from PM Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and patron of the Pakistan Hindu Council, didn’t respond to queries from TOI about the spike in allegedly forced conversion and marriage of Hindu girls. Kheal Das Kohistani of the opposition Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) condemned the incidents, saying forcible conversion and attacks on Hindu shrines had left the minority community scared.Dawani claimed that unidentified people recently vandalised the Mata Rani temple at Chachro in Tharparkar district of Sindh.On January 4, a mob had attacked Gurdwara Nankana Sahib in Nankana Sahib, the birthplace of Guru Nanak Dev . This followed the kidnapping, conversion and forced marriage of a Sikh preacher’s daughter.Read the story in Gujarati",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73679147,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-336487,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/hindu-girl-abducted-from-wedding-venue-converted-married-off-in-pakistan/articleshow/73679144.cms
31,['28/01/2020'],CAA: India ramps up efforts to counter anti-CAA move in European Parliament,"NEW DELHI: With the European Parliament due to discuss a resolution sharply critical of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on Wednesday, India is ramping up diplomacy in Brussels and Strasbourg to counter the move by hundreds of MEPs.Though European Parliament resolutions don’t affect decisions of the European Council or European Commission, they could impinge on bilateral relations at a time when India and the EU are looking to reset their relationship. PM Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Brussels in March for the India-EU summit while foreign minister S Jaishankar is expected to visit in mid-February.The six draft resolutions moved by several groups have coalesced into a single joint motion resolution and a simple majority of those present and voting is required for it to go through. The movers are also looking to criticise Indian policy in J&K.Evidently conscious of the potential fallout on bilateral ties, EU spokesperson for foreign affairs and security policy Virginie Battu-Henriksson said, “The European Parliament is currently planning to hold a debate on legislation adopted by the government of India last December... It is important to recall these texts are only drafts tabled by various political groups in the European Parliament.”She reiterated that the EU will host its 15th summit with India on March 13 in Brussels with a view to strengthen its strategic partnership. “India is a key partner for EU to address global challenges and to jointly promote rules-based multilateral order... opinions expressed by the European Parliament and its members do not represent the official position of the European Union,” the spokesperson said.Gaitri Kumar, India’s envoy to Brussels, met the groups who sponsored the drafts in the past couple of days to explain the Indian perspective. Some of the groups are now more convinced of the Indian argument, it was claimed. The resolutions, sources here believe, have been sponsored by Pakistan via some British Labour and Liberal Democrat MEPs who belong to groups like S&D and Renew Europe, who put up the motions.The 73 MEPs from the UK will leave European Parliament on January 31 when Brexit comes into force. So, in a sense, this is a last opportunity for many of these representatives to target India. For Pakistan, the exercise keeps issues in play, particularly as they are portrayed as violation of human rights and Islamophobia.The Indian defence centres on the argument that the CAA process is internal to India and is being debated hotly in the public sphere and the courts as in any democratic set-up. There are 60 petitions pending in the SC against the amendment. The government’s view has been that the entire process would be allowed to run the course of popular and judicial scrutiny. For the European Parliament to be passing resolutions on something that is undergoing scrutiny in India would be disingenuous.Government sources said, “The CAA is a matter that is entirely internal to India. Moreover, this legislation has been adopted by due process and through democratic means after a public debate in both Houses of Parliament.”The EU delegation in Delhi told journalists, “The European Parliament is an independent institution, sovereign in the organisation of its work and in its deliberations. The text referred to are draft resolutions by political groups in the EP.”But within the Indian government, certain quarters said the commission and member states should do their bit with their own MEPs given the extensive briefings their diplomats were accorded by India. “As fellow democracies, the European Parliament should not take actions that call into question the rights and authority of democratically elected legislatures in other regions of the world,” a source said.In addition, India said European countries have their conditions for naturalisation dependent on certain criteria. India’s context in the circumstance of Partition and its aftermath was not discrimination, the source said. “Every society that fashions a pathway to naturalisation contemplates both a context and criteria. This is not discrimination. In fact, European societies have followed the same approach,” the source added.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73687993,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-951333,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-ramps-up-efforts-to-counter-anti-caa-move-in-european-parliament/articleshow/73679348.cms

Kapil Wadhawan, promoter and former CMD of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (File photo)

MUMBAI: The ED arrested Kapil Wadhawan , promoter and former CMD of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL), on Monday in connection with a money laundering case being investigated against late drug smuggler Iqbal Memon alias Mirchi . The ED has alleged that Kapil siphoned off Rs 2,186 crore from DFHL into five shell companies, which had a role in acquiring Mirchi’s properties. The agency is trying to track down the end beneficiary of the funds.

Kapil was produced before the special court and remanded to two days of ED custody. Meanwhile, the court granted Kapil’s brother Dheeraj Wadhawan aka Baba Dewan bail in the case on Monday. On January 15, the court had taken cognisance of the chargesheet submitted in the case and issued summons against the accused.

Seeking Kapil’s custody, the ED, in its remand plea, told the court that funds were siphoned off through the shell companies at a time when the Wadhawans, through their front company Sunblink, had purchased three of Mirchi’s Worli properties using funds raised from DHFL. The ED added in 2010-11, DHFL had granted Rs 1,500 crore in loans to the five companies—Faith Realtors, Marvel Township, Able Realty, Poseidon Realty and Randon Realtors. The loan with interest amounted to Rs 2,186 crore and was shown as outstanding in the DHFL books till last year. The ED said there is no document available with DHFL on loans to these five companies. It alleged that the loans were granted bypassing DHFL’s policy. Sunblink is controlled by the Wadhawans and Kapil is responsible for decisions taken by DHFL, stated the remand application.

The remand plea also said the directors of the shell companies had told the ED that the Wadawan brothers were actually beneficiaries in these entities. The five were dummy companies without any assets and created with the sole purpose of siphoning off public money as no business was conducted by them, stated the ED.

The Wadhawans controlled Sunblink in which their relative was director. The ED’s remand application stated the Wadhawans, in connivance with Bhatija, purchased shares of the five shell companies and they amalgamated in Sunblink. The loan outstanding of the five companies was appropriated in Sunblink’s books.

West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee (File photo)

KOLKATA: The West Bengal assembly on Monday passed a resolution against “the interrelated” CAA , NRC and NPR, becoming the fourth state after Kerala, Punjab and Rajasthan to make the move.

Congress and Left Front added muscle to Trinamool Congress’s opposition and the single BJP MLA present in the assembly was the lone voice of dissent.

Chief minister Mamata Banerjee called the CAA a law that is “a shame to humanity and civilisation” and sought its immediate withdrawal.

The resolution found “giving citizenship on the basis of religion and community” as “against the multifaceted democratic structure of the country”. “So this assembly, through the state government, wants to appeal to the Centre to repeal CAA… and withdraw the interrelated NRC and NPR,” it said.

Accusing BJP of trying to divide India on the basis of religion and spreading intolerance and hatred, Mamata said CAA is not only anti-people but also goes against the spirit of the Constitution. “BJP may have numbers but that does not give it the right to mould the country according to its agenda,” she said. “We want CAA to be repealed and will not allow NRC or NPR to be implemented in this country. We have already stopped NPR work,” she said.

Mumbai: To better align Indian traders and hedgers of crude oil derivative products with global markets, BSE on Monday announced signing an agreement with US-based ICE , the parent of New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ), New York Board of Trade and several other bourses, to use its expertise in Brent futures for trading in rupee-denominated crude oil contracts on the Indian exchange.

“This licensing agreement will help Indian market participants access rupee-denominated Brent benchmark prices and deepen the Indian commodity markets by providing convenient and cost-effective onshore hedging products. It will also enable the price discovery of Brent crude prices in the Indian time zone based on domestic fundamentals,” a release from BSE said.

India is one of the largest consumers and importers of crude oil in the world and Brent crude is highly co-related with the Indian crude oil basket, it said. “Oil producers, refiners, users and investors in India can benefit from access to Brent crude prices.” This agreement between BSE and ICE is aimed at serving the needs and interests of the Indian energy commodities space, it said.

While unfurling tricolour at Machariyanwa village under Daniyawan block in Patna district, CM Nitish Kumar said more than eight crore saplings would be planted in the state under the state government’s ‘Jal Jeevan Hariyali (JJH)’ campaign.

“Several initiatives will be taken by the state government under JJH campaign over the next three years utilising funds to the tune of Rs 24,500 crore in order to give a better future to youths. Different schemes being executed under JJH mission include rainwater harvesting, revival of lakes, ponds and other water bodies as well as installation of solar panels,” he said.

Mumbai: Bank of Baroda ’s newly-appointed MD & CEO Sanjiv Chadha has said that he will continue with his predecessor P S Jayakumar ’s strategy of bringing in talent from outside when required and would position the lender as a universal bank with a global presence.

Chadha was appointed earlier this month, more than three months after Jayakumar completed his term on October 14. Jayakumar, a former Citibanker, was the first instance of the government hiring a banker form the private sector to head a public-sector bank. While private bankers were shortlisted, the government chose Chadha from SBI group.

“There is space for a few universal banks in the country and Bank of Baroda has the potential to be one of them. In terms of particular products, probably the bank has not been able to create the same value in certain specialised lines as compared to, say, SBI. But I do believe that the scope is there.” said Chadha. He added that in these products there is scope to collaborate in the market to create value.

He said that the bank would also maintain its international business. “The international business is a very important part of BoB ’s balance sheet, it helps us serve customers and diversify risk. As far as offices are concerned, you’ll always be rationalising some and opening new ones as you align the bank’s structure to new opportunities,” he said.

On the lateral recruitment policy adopted by Jayakumar, Chadha said, “I think it was one of the great achievements of Jayakumar that he had the courage and the ability to bring in talent from the market. It would be a pity if the flow of talent is always a one-way process from PSBs to private sector banks.”

“I remain as committed as Jayakumar was to bring in talent from outside,” he said.

Commenting on the merger of Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank with BoB, Chadha said that it was necessary as there was not much room for sub-size players and there was a need for large banks to support the economy. He said that the outcome of the merger was in line with expectations. “Our profitability and net interest income have been growing as per industry. The share of CASA (current and savings account deposits) has grown 280 basis points even as the merger was being executed. Even in credit, there are segments in retail which have grown sharply. Auto loans are over 40% and unsecured loans have grown 23%,” said Chadha. He said that once the complex issues of the merger were addressed the bank would be in a position to capitalise on its synergies.

Prashant Kishor

PATNA: Poll strategist Prashant Kishor , who is presently working for Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), took a dig at Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday over the latter’s appeal to people to “press the EVM button in anger” in the ensuing Delhi elections in view of anti-CAA protests in the country.

“The EVM button will be pressed with love on February 8. Jod ka jhatka dhire se lagna chahiye (the great shock should feel like a mild current) so that brotherhood and harmony is not endangered,” Kishor tweeted.

Kishor’s tweet was in reference to a remark made by Shah during an election rally in Delhi on Sunday. “When you press the button (on the voting machine ) on February 8, do so with such anger that its current is felt at Shaheen Bagh…Your vote to the BJP candidate will make Delhi and the country safe and prevent thousands of incidents like Shaheen Bagh,” Shah was quoted as saying by PTI while campaigning for the BJP candidate in Babarpur constituency of Delhi.

Representative image

PUNE: The ‘Zero Fatality Corridor’ (ZFC) initiative has resulted in a 43% drop in fatalities on the Pune-Mumbai expressway since its launch in 2016, according to the latest ZFC data.

ZFC — a joint initiative by Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), Maharashtra Highway Police, SaveLIFE Foundation and Mahindra & Mahindra — has brought down deaths due to accidents from 151 in 2016 to 86 in 2019.

The data also show that the severity of crashes, defined as the number of deaths per 100 crashes, has also come down from 53.3% to 24.8%.

While there has been a reduction in fatalities, the data however show that the number of accidents along the high-speed corridor has increased significantly.

Officials give credit to engineering interventions undertaken by MSRDC, such as addressing 15 risk factors — man-made roadside structures, narrow shoulders, vision obstruction, steep slopes and sharp curvatures. The report states that 11 risk factors have been completely eliminated, 3,000 engineering issues have been fixed and 2,700 sign boards were installed along the 91km stretch in the past four years.

“Every death on the expressway is a matter of grave concern. We will not rest till we get to zero preventable deaths,” R L Mopalwar, vice-chairman and managing director of MSRDC, said.

Additional director general of police (traffic) Vinay Kargaonkar said intensified patrolling and a zero-tolerance policy towards violators have also paid off. “Going forward, we will intensify the same,” he said.

Piyush Tewari, founder and CEO of SaveLIFE, said such a partnership-based approach was the best way to save lives on Indian roads. “We still have some way to go to achieve zero preventable fatalities, but our strong partnership with the authorities gives us the confidence to go forward,” Tewari said.

Tewari added that rear-end crashes and speeding were the two major factors resulting on deaths on the expressway. “Constant and vigilant patrolling on the stretch can ensure stricter action against traffic violations like speeding, lane indiscipline and illegal parking,” he said.

Over the next two years, SaveLIFE will improve road safety indicators to achieve the zero fatality goal by 2021. The foundation and the authorities said they were considering the deployment of drones, implementation of Intelligent Traffic Monitoring System, Advanced Intimation System and enhanced smart patrolling to reach this goal.

Former chief of Citi India, Pramit Jhaveri (File photo)

MUMBAI: Former chief of Citi India, Pramit Jhaveri , is likely to join the board of one of the key Tata Trusts that holds significant stake in Tata Sons, the holding company for Tata Group. Jhaveri is expected to strengthen the board from a professional standpoint. Jhaveri, who headed Citi India for most of the last decade, has had a long-standing relation with the Tata Group. Prior to his taking charge of the bank’s India operation, he headed investment banking operations and supported the Tatas in most of the acquisition deals.

Besides being close to Ratan Tata , Jhaveri has also worked with N Chandrasekaran during his days at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). TCS had in 2008 acquired Citigroup Global Services. The Tata Group has been working on strengthening Tata Trusts after the recent tussle with former chairman Cyrus Mistry, who had fallen out with board members including Ratan Tata.

The Tata Trusts include the two key bodies Sir Ratan Tata Trust and Sir Dorabji Tata Trust. Both of them have allied trusts. Those allied to Sir Ratan Tata Trust are Navajbai Ratan Tata Trust, Tata Education and Development Trust, Bai Hirabai J N Tata Navsari Charitable Institution and Sarvajanik Seva Trust.

The Dorabji Tata Allied Trusts include the Lady Tata Memorial Trust, JRD Tata Trust, Jamsetji Tata Trust, Tata Social Welfare Trust, Tata Education Trust, the RD Tata Trust and the JRD & Thelma J Tata Trust.

RAJKOT/AHMEDABAD: Former Gondal MLA , Mahipatsinh Jadeja’s grandson , was booked after investigation into the killing of three Indian Wild Asses on January 14, revealed that he had shot dead three of the critically endangered animals with his 12 bore gun.

Dhruvrajsinh Jadeja was booked after two persons - Dashrath Mahaliya (45) and Suleman Jam (35).- from Dhrangadhra arrested by Surendranagar local crime branch (LCB) on Sunday revealed his name.

“Mahaliya and Jam had taken Dhruvrajsinh Jadeja in an SUV inside the Little Rann and that the latter shot dead the wild asses,” said Deepak Dhol, inspector with Surendranagar LCB.

Dhruvrajsinh along with with his driver Kana Darbar and two unidentified friends had come in his SUV to his farmhouse in Juni Enjar village near Dhrangadhra on January 14. Mahaliya, who guarded Dhruvrajsinh’s farmhouse, told the cops that Dhruvrajsinh had expressed his wish to go to Vachhrada Dada temple located inside the wildlife sanctuary. Mahaliya and Jam, who knew different routes of the sanctuary, took Dhruvrajsinh into the sanctuary in his SUV.

“On their way back from the temple, Dhruvrajsinh spotted a herd of wild asses and shot down one of them. As other wild asses started running, he chased the herd and shot dead two more from his 12 bore gun,” Dhol added.

After the carcasses of the wild asses were found on January 17, Dhrangadhra police station registered a case on January 23 on the complaint of K A Multani, range forest officer of Koparani range. Dhrangadhra DySP R B Devadha formed three teams of Surendranagar LCB, Dhrangadhra taluka police station and forest officers and launched an investigation.

Forest officials said that there have been several instances of neel gais being killed in and around Surendranagar, but the locals burn their bodies. However, this was the first time that the bodies of killed wild asses were left at the spot.

The officials said it was surprising that the bodies were left undisposed as locals are aware that hunting is banned.

Dhruvrajsinh will be booked for poaching of schedule I animal under the Wildlife Protection Act, but he is yet to be arrested.

PATNA: Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) state president and Samastipur MP Prince Raj on Monday said the party’s prospective ticket aspirants have been asked to make 25,000 primary members in the assembly constituency of their choice from among the 119 seats that have no MLAs from the NDA.

The deadline to accomplish the twin tasks is March this year. Prince also released the list of the members of the newly constituted state executive committee.

Prince said the membership exercise would generate competitive feeling among the ticket aspirants, who have also been asked to identify the burning problems specific to the constituencies that needed to be addressed.

“The party’s functionaries will assess the ticket aspirants’ performance and then shortlist two, three or four most prospective candidates for the final selection,” he said.

GHMC commissioner Lokesh Kumar told the bench that there are 185 lakes in Hyderabad and the civic body has brought in a lake protection force to protect them.

The bench sought to know from Lokesh as to why the GHMC is facing so many cases from the public.

“The pathetic condition of our lakes, roads, garbage disposal, illegal structures will bring a bad name to our city,” the CJ said.

“Explain how you are planning to revive these lakes, and we will supervise all the works on a regular basis.”

Residents alerted police following foul smell emanating from the car parked near Kunigal Circle. On opening the door, cops found the body on the back seat. The abandoned car was in a running condition.

Examination of CCTV footage from nearby buildings showed a man entering the car on the night of January 23. Since then, he hadn’t come out, police said.

“It looks like he died the same night. Since there are no signs of struggle or fight, we don’t suspect it to be a murder.

Chennai: Tyre exports, between April and November were up 11% y-o-y by volume, a shade lower than the 12% y-o-y increase in export volume previously.

Tyre companies exported 77,70,439 units in the April-November period, up from 70,14,231 units in the year-ago period. This despite production dropping by 6% to 1,213 lakh units from 1,294 lakh units in the year-ago period as vehicle companies cut back production drastically, data from Association of Tyre Manufacturers Association (ATMA) said.

Tyre exports hit double-digit growth in FY16-17 when it increased by 16%. But the very next year, export growth was down to 6%, followed by a 0.2% fall in FY18-19. The rise in exports this year comes after two years of sluggish shipments. With tyre product mix reflecting global trends, exports are expected to increase further, said Satish Sharma, president-Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa, Apollo Tyres.

What has also helped is that vehicle companies, both Indian and MNC, are “increasingly exporting out of India which is a production hub and tyre exports are riding on it. Also globally, ‘made in India’ has as good if not a better reputation than ‘made in China’,” added Sharma. Typically tyre companies export around 10%-15% of their production. Although tyre replacement demand is still buoyant, with domestic sales falling and OEs cutting production, overall tyre production has also taken a hit, said Sharma.

“In value terms OE is 30% while replacement is 70% but in many segments OE volumes are significant,” said Sharma.

The highest increase in exports has been in motorcycles (up 23%), followed by three-wheelers (up 20%). Passenger vehicles are up 10% and medium and heavy trucks and buses are up 12%, the data showed.

Mumbai: The country’s largest mortgage company HDFC on Monday reported its highest ever quarterly net profit of Rs 8,372 crore for October-December 2019 — nearly thrice the net profit of Rs 2,114 crore in the corresponding period in the previous year. The sharp increase in earnings was a result of changes in accounting after its erstwhile subsidiary Gruh finance merged with Bandhan Bank .

Following the merger on October 17, 2019, HDFC allotted 15.9 crore shares aggregating 9.9% of the total issued share capital of Bandhan Bank. “In accordance with para 22 of ‘Ind AS 28 – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’, On derecognition of the investment in Gruh, the corporation has recognised a fair value gain of Rs 9,020 crore,” HDFC said in a statement.

In a post-results call, Keki Mistry, VC and CEO, said this was the first time that loans in the bank’s books crossed Rs 5 lakh crore in an assets under management (AUM) basis. “The 14% increase in AUM were driven by a 16% increase in individual loans,” said Mistry. “The loan growth is largely happening in the affordable segment. This is reflected in the average loan size, which has been falling in every quarter — from Rs 27.7 lakh, to Rs 27.6 lakh to Rs 26.5 lakh. Taken together, the average loan size of this fiscal works out to Rs 26.9 lakh.”

The corporation has used a large chunk of the exceptional gains during the quarter to make provisions. As against the mandated provision of Rs 3,624 crore, HDFC made a provision of Rs 9,934 crore or 2.25% of total loans.

The profit-before-tax for the nine months ended December 31, 2019 stood at Rs 17,658 crore compared to Rs 9,428 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. In the same nine months, 36% of home loans approved in volume terms and 18% in value terms have been to customers from the economically weaker section (EWS) and low income groups (LIG).

The corporation on an average, has been approving 9,400 loans monthly to the EWS and LIG segment, with monthly such average approvals at Rs 1,500 crore. The average home loan to the EWS and LIG segment stood at Rs 10.2 lakh and Rs 17.6 lakh respectively.

BIHARSHARIF: State assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Chaudhary on Monday described resolutions passed by different state assemblies against the implementation of Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ) as “unlawful” as the Constitution does not provide any scope for it.

Addressing media persons at Sheikhpura circuit house, Chaudhary said states were constitutionally bound to implement any Act passed by the Parliament.

Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan and West Bengal assemblies have so far passed resolutions against CAA.

Lauding ‘Jal Jeevan Haryali’ campaign of the state government, Chaudhary said, “Pollution can be controlled only through conservation of groundwater and environment. The entire world should emulate this campaign of the state government aimed at reducing pollution.”

Work commenced last week and the completion target has been set at 18 months.“The park will be set up keeping in mind the smart city concept, in which everyone, including special children and people with disabilities, has equal opportunities,” said an official.According to plans, the park will have various activities and play zones designed for children with special needs, including games for children with impaired vision where they will be able to play with help of Braille. There will be a water arena, a sandpit and a fossil-dig area as well.There will also be a wheelchair-friendly swing and see-saw. “The park will allow children with special needs to spend quality time in an open green space,” an official said.Parents of children with special needs have welcomed the initiative.“Special children do not get proper space in general parks and they cannot mix freely with other children. We, as parents, always worry about how they will react in such situations. A free space for children with special needs will be of immense help,” said Abhijit Dasgupta, a father of one such child.“Special children need sensory and motor units to properly express themselves.

Chinsurah: A Hooghly court on Monday sentenced two persons to death for the abduction, rape, murder, mutilation and burial of a Class VI girl in Balagarh on December 12, 2014. A third accused, who was 17-years-old then, is being tried before a juvenile court in Hooghly. On Saturday, the Hooghly sessions court had convicted Gourab Mondal and Kaushik Malik for the crime. The same court handed down the death penalty on Monday.

The victim was heading for tuition from her home in Uttar Gopalnagarh village on December 12, 2014, when she was abducted by the duo and the teen, all from Hattala village. When she didn’t return home by 7.30pm, her parents Chinmoy, a flower farmer, and Pranati Mondal looked for her all night and filed a missing diary the next day.

A day later, the abductors called Mondal and demanded Rs 3 lakh as ransom. However, Mondal told them he could not arrange so much money.Police tracked the trio with the location the call was made from and arrested them.

During interrogation, the trio confessed they abducted and raped the girl. On not getting the ransom, they killed her and chopped off the legs. They confessed to burying the body on the banks of the Ganga in the Jirat area. Police took the trio to the spot and exhumed the body.

The two adult accused were charged with abduction, rape and murder, among other offences. Their teenaged accomplice — who was similarly charged — was sent to a juvenile court that remanded him in a government home.

After Monday’s sentencing, Mondal said, “Though we will never get our daughter back, this judgment has brought us some solace.”

58,['28/01/2020'],Accused in Maha arms haul was nabbed thrice in Bengal,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Kolkata/Mumbai: A 34-year-old man from Usthi in South 24 Parganas was nabbed by the Kolkata Police STF and Maharashtra ATS on January 20 for allegedly being a part of the right-wing outfit that was involved in the Nallasopara alleged arms haul case. Pratap Hazra, a resident of Hazrapara, has also been accused of being part of the conspiracy to carry out an attack at a music event, Sunburn 2017, in Pune.

“Hazra was wanted under the Unlawful Activity (Prevention) Act. We got a tip from ATS, which stated he had been on the run from 2018 and that he was the 13th accused who specialized in crude bombs and explosives. We picked him up from Usthi through our network,” an officer said. According to cops, he was arrested at least thrice for disturbing communal harmony by the Diamond Harbour police.

Hazra has been sent to police custody till January 30, but his Bengal exploits have left STF worried. The ATS has already alerted STF about another Bengal operative, a close aide of Hazra who remains elusive. The Kolkata Police STF said work on this front has begun with Bengal STF.

An officer in the team led by additional DG (ATS) Deven Bharti said Hazra had developed ties with the Govansh Raksha Samiti and later, the Bhavani Sena.

“Our investigation revealed that Hazra had trained other members of the group on the preparation of country-made bombs,” he told TOI.

“Hazra was on the run ever since other members of this group began to be picked up one by one since 2018. Since some members were also allegedly involved in the murders of rationalists Narendra Dabholkar and Gauri Lankesh, we will be investigating if Hazra had any role in those crimes. We arrested Hazra on January 20,” the ATS officer said.

In August 2018, the ATS had arrested three men — Sharad Kalaskar, Sudhanva Gondhalekar and Hindu Govansh Raksha Samiti member Vaibhav Raut — for possessing firearms and planning disruptive activities. Later, cops claimed the accused had conspired to orchestrate terror activities in Maharashtra, including Mumbai.

“When cops searched a property of Raut in Nallasopara, they found eight crude bombs in the house and 12 crude bombs in his shop. The seized material include gelatin sticks and chits containing literature on how to prepare bombs,” said an ATS officer. The agency had arrested 12 persons in the case and had filed a charge sheet in December 2018.

Pune: Three members of a family, including a six-month-old girl, suffered burn injuries following an LPG cylinder blast in their Kharadi house on Monday morning.

Fire brigade officials said Swarali Shankar Bhowale, her father, Shankar (28), and mother, Asha (22), stayed in a small rented house in the Sambhajinagar area of Kharadi.

After waking up on Monday morning, Asha was about to ignite the gas stove when the cylinder exploded. The officials said the flames soon spread in the room. Fire station officer Subhas Jadhav and his team reached the Bhowales’ place after receiving an emergency call at 8am.

“The granite platform in the kitchen was broken and the tin roof of the house went up in the air. Their clothes, bedding and other articles were gutted. The walls of two adjoining houses developed cracks in the explosion,” an officer said.

Mumbai: Markets regulator Sebi on Monday allowed differentiated margining systems for trading in derivatives of several commodities, by grading them according to inherent risks. It also said during the period considered off season for an agro commodity, an exchange could hike the margins for that commodity, mainly to rein in price volatility.

It also said that commodity exchanges (commexes) should categorise all tradeable commodities into three categories — low, medium and high — based on their price fluctuations in three years, and apply margins accordingly.It also said that the commex that records the highest turnover across all derivatives contracts for a particular commodity for the previous six months should be categorized as the lead exchange. The margin for that particular commodity should be set by the lead bourse and other bourses will follow the same margin system.

Market players said that given the very nature of commodities trading, a specilaised margining system was needed. “Recent incidents of risk management especially in Agri derivatives made it apparent that the risk management tools of securities markets can’t be superimposed on commodity derivatives market in totality, and hence it requires some modifications. This circular is a step in that direction wherein the challenges of risk emerging from the underlying commodities market have been addressed,” said Sanjit Prasad, MD, ICEX.

Patna police resorted to lathi charge on Bihar energy department employees at Vidyut Bhawan Baily road in Patn... Read More

PATNA: Police on Monday resorted to lathicharge and used water cannons on energy department employees protesting near Income Tax roundabout over “strong rumour” that the state government was privatizing Bihar State Power Holding Company Limited (BSPHCL) and its subsidiary companies.

Around 300 workers and engineers of power holding companies from various districts had gathered near Vidyut Bhawan under the banner of Vidyut Kamgar Padhadhikari Abhiyanta Sanyukt Sangharsh Morcha. They disrupted traffic on Bailey Road and Beerchand Patel Path and threatened to go on strike if the department decided to privatize BSPHCL and its subsidiaries.

Surendra Kumar, general secretary of Power Engineering Service Association, told this newspaper that they had written a letter to BSPHCL chief managing director (CMD) Pratyaya Amrit to make things clear on the issue. “We asked him to give clear answers about the issue as PM Narendra Modi has already said about privatization of power companies under Aditya Yojana. However, when there was no reply from the CMD, we gathered here to talk to him. But he refused to meet us. We will continue our protest,” he said.

A junior engineer from Gaya said police chased them like criminals and many of the employees were injured. “We are fighting for our rights. If the state government privatizes power holding company, we will lose our jobs,” he said.

Another employee of the power company said all staff recruited after 2012 will lose their jobs in case of privatization.

Pratyaya, when contacted, told this newspaper that a rumour had been spread among the engineers and employees of the power company that privatization had already been done. “We are inquiring about those who spread the rumour and how. I addressed the employees from across the state on last Monday, Saturday and even today through videoconferencing and assured them not to worry,” he said.

He added: “In November 2018, we had sent a letter to the Centre about our comments on proposed reforms and our experience with private players. It was horrendous. Then we terminated the franchise in Gaya, Muzaffarpur and Bhagalpur,” he clarified.

Nalsar vice chancellor Faizan Mustafa garlanding the statue of IPS officer KS Vyas' statue at RBVRR TS Police ... Read More

HYDERABAD: Nalsar University of Law vice-chancellor Faizan Mustafa said students and academicians were particularly upset with the way police had handled the incidents in JNU and Aligarh Muslim University . He also said perception about police force is bad in the country and urged governments to spend more on police force.

Mustafa said students were unhappy about the disproportionate use of force at JNU, Delhi and AMU , Aligarh. “Delhi police, I believe, have done disservice to their reputation by their actions in JNU and the slow progress of investigation about the armed attack on some students,” Mustafa said.

“Since people have started reading the preamble of Constitution recently, it will be good for society if lower-rung officials also start understanding the fundamentals of Constitution,” he said while delivering the KS Vyas Memorial Lecture at the Telagana State Police Academy (TSPA) here on Monday.

A senior professor and jurist of constitutional law, Mustafa said governments should allocate more funds to strengthen the police force and also fill vacancies in the police department. All the states in India put together allot just 3% of their total budget for the police department. Among the states, Manipur allots the highest budget (8.7%) for cops.

Telangana’s budget allotment for cops is 1.9%, while neighbouring AP spends 2.1%.

“There are 20% vacancies in the police force. As against the UN recommended 222 cops per one lakh population, we have only 137 cops per one lakh population,” Mustafa pointed out.

The VC also talked about how people were increasingly swayed by the rule of law. “We are increasingly going in the direction of rule by law. You can pass any law which may be an unjust law or arbitrary law, a law which may be negation of fundamental principles of the Constitution and then you are governed by that law. As a teacher, it is a bad time to talk to a police officer,” he observed.

Mustafa said that NALSAR is signing an MoU with TSPA to provide degrees, diploma and certificate courses in law to police officials. The VC also advised trainee SIs to follow principles of Constitution.

Remembering IPS officer Vyas who lost his life in a Maoist attack, Telangana DGP M Mahendar Reddy said Vyas continues to inspire them. “If we have been able to curb Maoist activities , it is because of his contribution,” the DGP said.

‘AI’s land & building are not part of selloff’

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday offered to exit Air India and Air India Express by selling its entire stake, instead of the 76% it had offered two years ago, apart from the 50% it owns in ground-handling joint venture AI-SATS. It targets to complete the disinvestment process in the next five to six months.Learning from its 2018 experience, the government has eased eligibility norms for bidders too, and they will be expected to take on Rs 32,447 crore of debt-cum-liabilities — essentially current value of 146 aircraft they will be getting — of the total amount of Rs 88,781 crore with the government keeping with it Rs 56,334 crore.Unlike last time, there is no Jet Airways around (it shut down last April), making AI an attractive proposition. It is the only Indian carrier with medium- and long-haul wide-body aircraft, crew, flying rights and slots at airports across North America, Europe, Australia, Far East and Africa. With this USP, the Centre on Monday issued the preliminary information memorandum for AI’s strategic divestment where bidders, whether individual firms or consortia with a minimum net worth of Rs 3,500 crore — down from Rs 5,000 crore last time — can submit their bids for the airline by March 17.Indian carriers with negative net worth, which includes most of them except IndiGo , can also bid if they have a JV partner with whom they meet the minimum criteria. Qualified bidders will be announced on March 31. If all goes well, by July or August, the airline may have a new owner, who will need to retain the brand name AI.While the AI has a debt of over Rs 60,000 crore, bidders will be expected to take Rs 23,286.5 crore, which the written down value of AI and AI Express aircraft. Since the government has decided net assets will be equal to net liabilities for bidders, the latter will need to take over Rs 8,771.5 crore as of March 31, 2019. This exact figure will be decided on the date of the transaction though the total burden is expected to be about Rs 32,447 crore.The government will take over the remaining Rs 56,334 crore of debt and liabilities and transfer them to a specially-created special purpose vehicle AI Assets Holdings Ltd. This SPV will get AI’s non-core assets like land, building and artwork worth Rs 17,000 crore, which it will sell off and reduce the debt burden. The state will similarly devise ways to dilute the over Rs 39,000-crore debt with the SPV.Describing AI as a “great asset” with a young fleet of planes, especially widebody aircraft that fly across the globe, aviation minister H S Puri said: “Despite infusing Rs 30,500 crore in the AI since 2012, the airline has been running into losses year after year. Due to its accumulated debt of about Rs 60,000 crore, its financial position is very fragile. AI is in a debt trap that can be turned around by privatising it and we have learnt lessons from the 2018 bid. Lots of people have directly come to us and there is tremendous interest in AI (among potential buyers).”Puri termed the changed terms of sale regarding 100% stake sale; freezing AI debt for bidder at Rs 23,286.5 crore and current liabilities at Rs 8,771.5 crore (as on March 31, 2019) as “decisive parameters”. “AI’s land and building are not part of this sale.

66,['28/01/2020'],"Experts seek delineation of Jayakwadi, upstream dams","This story is from January 28, 2020

Aurangabad: With the Marathwada region again staring at an water crisis, experts have called for paying attention to the long-pending demand for delineating the Jayakwadi major irrigation project and a few other important dams in the region.

They have also sought for delineation of the upstream reservoirs in Ahmednagar and Nashik districts.

The Maharashtra Management of Irrigation Systems by Farmers Act, 2005, mandates delineation of the command area — an exercise believed to require crores of rupees.

Water rights activist Abhijit Dhanorkar said political parties should pay attention to the factors leading to water scarcity in Marathwada instead of making vague and populist demands.

“Despite being mandatory, the delineation process is pending for the past 15 years. The Bombay high court had directed officials to carry out the delineation process of the Jayakwadi dam command area while resolving the regional disputes over equitable water distribution in its judgement of September 2016. We demand that the same exercise be carried out for all upstream and downstream areas,” said Dhanorkar adding that the delineation process was one of the prerequisites for creating a sound platform of water distribution.

Leftist leader Vilas Babar said political functionaries cutting across party lines from the region should raise the pitch for releasing funds for the delineation of dams across the state. “As per initial reports, an estimated Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,000 crore is required for the delineation of the command area of Jayakwadi dam alone. Government agencies can make the best use of technology to cut down the cost. A team of experts must be constituted to expedite the process of delineation,” said Babar.

While the delineation process is expected to decide the quantum of water for irrigation needs, stakeholders demand that the process be first carried out for the upstream areas of Jayakwadi dam.

“Marathwada is a drought-prone region. Upstream areas in Ahmednagar and Nashik districts receive good amount of water in the catchment areas of the dam. The delineation process should be first carried out for the reservoirs in the Ahmednagar and Nashik districts before undertaking the procedure for the Jayakwadi dam,” said Dhanorkar.

When contacted, officials from the water resources department (WRD) said the state government had to take a policy decision on the delineation of dams. “The law mandates the delineation of dams and the process can be initiated only if funds are made available,” said a senior WRD official.

The earlier deadline was January 24. The test is the first step for prospective students of both the institutes, followed by counselling sessions. Students applying for the acting courses also need to audition. Officials, however, added that the test dates — February 15 and 16 — remain unchanged.

The extension is in line with the extension given in the past two years. Due to a clampdown on internet services in most parts of J&K, aspirants from there could not apply for the test.

“The extension is mainly for students in J&K. Internet services were not available in many parts of Kashmir, which is why they could not fill forms online. We have collaborated with the culture department of the Union territory.,” FTII director Bhupendra Kainthola said.

The extension will help students apply for the test for a lower fee announced by FTII and SRFTI earlier this month. The JET fees were slashed after a student stir led the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to order a review.

Aurangabad: The South Central Railway (SCR) has introduced a GPS-based biometric attendance system for the On-Board House Keeping Services (OBHS). Apart from that, the OBHS staff will have to post geo-tagged photos of their works accomplished on the official platform to ensure compliance.

The Indian Railways has been operating ‘Coach-Mitra’, an online application for the benefit of rail users, especially passengers onboard, to get assistance with regard to problems or deficiency in travel comforts like coach cleaning, water supply and lighting on trains among other areas. Introduced in 2016, the digital application with OBHS facility has been now extended to 2,167 trains, including 72 pairs of trains from the SCR.

“In SCR, the OBHS facility has been implemented successfully. On average, the zone receives 470 requests per month in Coach-Mitra to assist in resolving various issues. Nearly 90% of the service requests are being attended,” chief public relations officer of SCR, Ch Rakhes said.

To avail the facility, the passenger has to send a message to the designated mobile numbers. They can also use an app or webpage for logging the request. The request is immediately acknowledged via SMS along with a code.

“A message is also sent to the OBHS staff travelling on the same train along with the details of the passenger. As per the message received, the OBHS staff travelling contacts the passenger and carries out the work accordingly,” SCR authorities said.

If the passenger is satisfied with the work, he or she discloses the code received and OBHS staff, in turn, sends the same code through SMS to complete the cycle. If the passenger is not satisfied, he or she does not disclose the code and the complaint is reviewed further.

Agra: Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) engineering students on Monday boycotted their pending examinations which had been rescheduled twice after the December 15 violence that erupted on the campus.

The examinations scheduled to culminate on December 23 of the current academic session were postponed due to the clash between police and students on December 15. Subsequently, the varsity authorities advanced the winter vacations. The examinations were postponed again after the university reopened as protests by the students against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) continued.

The students have been demanding resignations of the vice-chancellor and registrar accusing them of failing to protect students on the ill-fated day. Registrar of the university Abdul Hamid said that they are trying to convince the agitated students to appear for the examinations as they are losing the academic year. He said, “Even if we cancel the summer vacations of 45 days, they will be late in completing the academic session.”

While protests against CAA/NRC/NPR by the students continued in the campus on Monday, students from the faculty of Life Sciences and Commerce called a general body meeting on Tuesday to take a decision regarding boycott of examinations which are scheduled to start from Thursday.

Meanwhile, all students have decided to storm twitter with a hashtag “#AMUVCmustResign” on Monday night.

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD : The civic body said it would continue with the alternate day water supply for the foreseeable future.

Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar said the civic body will need an additional 30 million litres a day (MLD) to restart the once-a-day water supply.

Despite heavy rains that had filled Pavana dam — the lifeline of the city — to 100%, complaints of inadequate of low-pressure water supply had persisted. This prompted PCMC to decide to supply water on alternate days for two months, starting November 25, to ensure equitable and adequate supply.

But the complaints persisted in many parts of the city, and residents have been demanding that the civic body restart the daily water supply. “We will continue with the alternate day water supply plan for now. We have improved water availability in areas on the fringes by diverting the surplus from areas getting excess water,” Hardikar said.

“We need an additional 30 MLD of water to provide adequate water to all parts of the city. We will be able to start one time daily water supply only then,” Hardikar further said.

Under the 27 MLD Wagholi rural water supply scheme, water from Pavana river is lifted at Ravet bund, purified at a water treatment plan in Chikhali and supplied to areas in Pune Municipal Corporation limits. PCMC asked PMC for this share of the water. “PMC agreed in principle to hand over this share of water once the Bhama Askhed pipeline is completed. We can get 30 MLD from this scheme,” Hardikar said.

Representative image

PUNE: Jan-Arth Sankalpa, a group of experts that presented a shadow budget in the city last week, said the Centre should increase spending on welfare schemes, education and health care.

The experts said this can be done even by not disturbing the current allocation majorly in other sectors. “Tax-speculative trading, reversing the tax dole given to the big industry recently and re-imposing the erstwhile wealth tax can achieve this,” said Ajit Abhyankar , a member of Jan-Arth Sankalpa.

The group proposed that the healthcare expenditure in the upcoming Union Budget increase 40% to Rs88,000 crore, with a majority of the focus on the rural areas and providing medicines to government hospitals.

“A majority of the spends on health care are on outpatient department services and medicines. Only 3% of the people require hospitalization, so priorities need to be re-adjusted” said healthcare expert Anant Phadke.

The group also suggested that the Union government increase its spending on education by about 50% to about Rs1,43,000 crore. It said states must also follow suit and increase their allocations to both health and education. “Only then will the state of public education and infrastructure at public education institutes improve,” Sharad Javadekar of the Akhil Bharatiya Samajwadi Adhyapak Sabha said.

The members further urged the Centre to earmark at least Rs7,000 crore for walkways, bus tracks and cycle tracks. “The component of Metro rail/ MRT can be expanded to include mandatory walk, bus, cycle infrastructure improvements,” the experts said.

Bhubaneswar: A study conducted by members of Right to Food Campaign has found that foodstuffs such as chhatua, sooji halua and groundnut ladu served to children and pregnant women at anganwadi centres in inaccessible areas of Malkangiri are not only of poor quality, but are positively unfit for consumption.

The members tested the food during visits to the Maoist-hit Chitrakonda block and the Bonda hills in Khairput block. They inspected the food distributed among beneficiaries of the state government’s Integrated Child Development Services as nutrition supplements.

“We examined and weighed the food packets in the presence of villagers. The food is of poor quality. The packets don’t even have enough food. In sooji halua, the sooji was not even fried,” said convener of the organisation, Pradip Pradhan.

In Jantapai and Paparamelta villages of Chitrakonda, the members found that each packet of chhatua fell short of the prescribed weight by 105 grams, while the groundnut packet fell short by 39 grams. Upon inquiry, an anganwadi worker said the annual requirement of rice at her centre was 3.5 quintal, but that the transport agent supplied 21kg less rice.

In Badapada village in Khairput, the members found that the anganwadi centre was running in the verandah of the villagers since the actual centre was under construction. “We found a number of malnourished children here,” Pradhan said.

The members found samples of parboiled rice, chhatua and groundnut ladus unsafe as per Food Safety and Security Act, 2006. The colour and the smell of the foodstuffs were off in most samples. Only the sooji halua was found to be satisfactory based on the tests performed.

“We have collected the samples and tested them in Bhubaneswar. The results were astonishing. All the food items, except for sooji, was found to be unsafe for consumption. The ICDS is to ensure that children eat nutritional food. Our findings have just proved that the project has failed big time,” Akhand Mishra, a member of the organisation, said.

Malkangiri collector Manish Agrawal told TOI that he would inquire into the matter and take action. “We haven’t received the report yet, but will initiate an inquiry into the matter. We will take strict action if anyone is found to have neglected their duty,” he said.

The notices which were dispatched on January 25, also added that online food delivery chains must get their delivery partners registered with Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) so that “immediate action can be taken against them if they were found indulging in delivery of any banned substance.”

Yogendra Pandey, district food safety officer, told TOI that the notices were issued after the department received complaints that food delivery personnel were also acting as couriers for materials including alcohol, cigarettes, charas, smack, ganja etc, thereby making access of intoxicants easier for students. The notice sent by the department goes on to add that if any of the delivery personnel are found supplying narcotic substances, the respective company's licence will be cancelled and suitable action taken under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.

“As per our intelligence inputs, the people who are delivering food are helping students get easy access to narcotics. This is being done at the behest of the drug cartel in the state which is using food delivery personnel to carry out its nefarious activities,” Pandey alleged.

AMARAVATI: Pushing TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu into a corner, YSRC recalled his address in the assembly of undivided AP to defend the abolition of the legislative council on Monday.As opposition leader in 2005, Naidu had strongly opposed the revival of the legislative council. Naidu had said the council would only add burden to the exchequer. Naidu’s 2005 speech was screened during the debate in the assembly on Monday.Referring to Naidu’s speech, senior legislator Dharmana Prasada Rao asked why Naidu was opposing the abolition of the council when the YSRC government was fulfilling his dream. He said Naidu stayed away from the assembly for fear of reading out his own statements.He said Naidu never sticks to one policy, ideology or a stance as he keeps changing decisions to suit his political convenience.“As an opposition, the Telugu Desam Party will give high priority to people’s interests and, hence, is opposing the proposal for the council’s revival. It might serve creating a few jobs to the followers of the ruling party not the people. In fact, the council is a big burden on the exchequer,” said Naidu during his speech in the assembly while taking on the then government’s proposal to revive the council.Dharmana said Naidu should have welcomed YSRC decision. He said that Naidu had dubbed the council as a chamber to rehabilitate political leaders and activists. He said that chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Redddy had come to a conclusion that there was no need to burden the people to create employment to some political leaders.He said that the council instead of giving wise advice to the assembly has become a roadblock in making laws needed by the people. He criticized Naidu for using the legislative council for undermining the peoples’ verdict. He said that Jagan had received 51% vote share in the assembly election.He said that getting such an overwhelming mandate is rare and Naidu was trying to tweak the people’s verdict through the council. He recalled remarks of Dr BR Ambedkar who said that setting up of the council was only a temporary measure, not permanent one.He asked why the Naidu government had not sent the CRDA bill which contains 171 pages to the select committee in 2015 while referring the decentralization bill with 12 pages to the select committee.Transport minister Perni Nani ripped through Naidu’s frequent U-turns on major political decisions.

AMARAVATI: The absence of 18 legislators out of 151 from the assembly on Monday during the debate and subsequent voting on the resolution to abolish the council is believed to have irked the YSRC leadership. All members, including chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy and ministers, stood in their places for over 20 minutes till the completion of counting process , which saw the resolution passed by a 133-0 verdict.

The CM is believed to have directed chief whip Gadikota Srikanth Reddy to summon the legislators who stayed away from voting and ask for explanation. Sources, however, said many legislators were unaware of the voting process and left the House as there was no communication from party whips. “It happened due to communication gap. The issuance of whip would have made them stay in the House. It’s mainly due to lack of clarity and communication gap. There is nothing to suspect, but we will still ask them to explain,” said a senior minister.

Government whip Chevireddy Bhaskara Reddy was among those who failed to cast his vote as the assembly speaker ordered the closure of all doors soon after the resolution was taken up for voting. Chevireddy had rushed out just before the doors closed to call other legislators. Kapu corporation chairman Dadisetti Raja and senior party leader Kolusu Pardhasaradhi were also stranded outside at the time.

ALLAHABAD: The private tutor of a six-year-old boy was arrested on Monday for murdering him two months ago. The decomposed body of the boy was recovered in Soraon on Monday.

According to police, Kuwar Bhan Singh alias Tuntun, 34, a resident of Gohri village, has confessed to the crime.

Inspector (Soraon) Anil Kumar Singh told TOI that Singh was a private tutor to victim Anand alias Changoo (6). On the evening of November 13, he had thrashed the boy severely in a fit of age after he failed to learn a lesson, he told police.

As a result, the boy’s head collided with a nearby wall and he began bleeding from his ear and mouth, Singh said.

The SHO further added, “When Singh noticed that the boy was not responding and was unconscious, he took his body to a nearby field and threw it into a dry well. The accused also confessed he covered the dry well with grass so that no one would notice it.”

When the boy did not return home, his family members began looking for him. After a search, they lodged a complaint that Anand was missing.

They also asked Singh, whom the family knew well, about Anand. Singh told the family that Anand had not come to study that evening. Singh also assured police he would inform them if he got to know anything about the boy.

Since November, police were investigating the case.

On Monday, the police rounded up Singh after clues led to him and quizzed him. Singh then confessed to have killed the boy and also led to the site where the body was buried.

A police team recovered the skeleton of Anand outside Vikas Ka Pura village.

Lohegaon airport officials on alert

PUNE: Two travellers , who recently returned from Shanghai and another city in China, were quarantined at the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) Naidu Infectious Diseases Hospital on Monday after they complained of minor influenza-like symptoms including cold and fever. Both are residents of Pune.Civic health officials on Monday sent the throat swab sample of one of the travellers to the city-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) for testing. The NIV has been designated as a referral laboratory for the testing and confirmation of the novel coronavirus infection in India.Three more travellers from Pimpri Chinchwad have been quarantined at home as they have been unsymptomatic so far. The samples of three travellers who were isolated at Kasturba hospital in Mumbai turned negative last week.Ramchandra Hankare, public health expert and PMC health department chief, said, “One of the travellers quarantined at Naidu hospital, a 51-year-old man, had recently returned from Shanghai. The other man, aged 30, had been to a city close to Wuhan in China. Both have developed minor illness in the form of cold and fever. They have been isolated only as a precautionary measure.”Hankare said that the throat swab sample of the 51-year-old man has been sent to NIV and the report is expected on Tuesday. The sample of the other man will be sent to NIV on Tuesday.Meanwhile, as many as 3,756 passengers returning from China and other coronavirus-affected countries have so far been screened at Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) since January 18. Of them, 15 travellers from Pune, Mumbai, Kalyan, Vasai and Virar have been kept under surveillance for the next 28 days. Six of them have been quarantined — four in Mumbai and two in Pune.""Barring these six travellers, none of the others have developed any illness. We are keeping a track of their health by making telephone calls. We have also asked them to report to us if they develop any symptoms,” state surveillance officer Pradip Awate said.Awate said that any airborne virus usually has an incubation period of 7 to 14 days. “But since this is the new variant of coronavirus, we don’t have conclusive information about its incubation period. Therefore, we have doubled the passenger tracking period,” he said.The state government on Monday decided to track and follow up on travellers who returned from China between January 1 and 17. The decision was taken during a meeting chaired by the state’s principal secretary Pradip Vyas on Monday. Presently, only travellers who returned from China after January 18 are being screened by state health officials.“We have also decided to carry out repeat tests of those who tested negative in earlier tests, including three Mumbai travellers. We will activate helpline 104 to handle people’s queries on coronavirus infection,” Awate said.Airports Authority of India said it was coordinating with the Pune customs officials to monitor potential coronavirus cases. “There are no medical checks in Pune, but immigration officials are monitoring arriving passengers and suspicious cases will be referred to the health department,” G Chandramouli, AAI western regional director, said.Pune doesn’t have a flight to/from China or anywhere in southeast Asia. But many foreign travelers arrive here via transit.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73683532,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-136567,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2-quarantined-in-pune-niv-to-confirm-coronavirus-infection/articleshow/73676119.cms
86,['28/01/2020'],‘Tainted’ construction firm allowed to carry on with city airport work,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Bhubaneswar: The collapse of the under-construction roof of a building connecting two terminals at Biju Patnaik International Airport (BPIA) here on Friday that killed a labourer has thrust private construction agency Dillip Constructions Private Limited to the limelight. Sources in the Airports Authority of India (AAI) said Dillip Constructions Private Limited was last year restrained from taking up any AAI work in the country.

The prohibited vendors’ list, uploaded on the AAI website, feature the name of Dillip Constructions Private Limited. According to the website, the AAI issued an order on March 22, 2019, barring the private agency from taking up any AAI tender for its poor performance.

Biju Patnaik airport authorities said the private construction firm had bagged the tender to construct the link building (whose roof collapsed) between domestic and international terminals in 2018. “We are aware that the agency has been barred. This was done for slow pace of work. The agency was restrained in 2019 from taking up any new AAI project but was asked to complete the ongoing project,” airport director V V Rao said.

Asked whether the same firm will be allowed to complete the work, Rao said, “The AAI will take the decision.”

Sources said the project started in February 2019 and was expected to be over within a year. The cost of the two-storey terminal linking project was Rs 56 crore out of which Rs 3 crore work has been completed. The rebuilding of the collapsed roof would cost around Rs 25 lakh.

Senior BJP spokesperson Gollak Mahapatra questioned the engagement of the agency in the airport construction work. “Even though the order was issued in 2019, the agency should not have been allowed to construct the link building. The agency should also not be allowed to complete the project,” Mahapatra said. Meanwhile, the AAI has completed a preliminary inquiry into Friday’s mishap but neither the AAI nor the BPIA officials disclosed the findings of the initial probe. Two AAI officials, an executive engineer and a general manager, from Kolkata reached Bhubaneswar on Saturday and conducted the preliminary inquiry into the circumstances that led to the mishap. They will submit their report the AAI headquarters. Sources said another team of experts from the AAI headquarters in Delhi is likely to visit the Bhubaneswar airport soon to conduct a full-fledged inquiry into the tragedy.

A joint technical committee, constituted by the commissionerate police to probe the airport roof collapse, strongly suspects that the contractor did not adopt adequate safety measures and allegedly compromised with the quality of work. The joint technical committee has forensic experts from the state forensic science laboratory (SFSL) and engineers from the state works department.

Additional commissioner of police Anup Kumar Sahoo said the joint technical committee has been asked to furnish the report at the earliest. A day after the tragedy, the police had arrested the construction company’s owner Dilip Khatei, supervisor Abhilash Sarkar and two AAI engineers — Gautam Ray and Ashis Sarkar — for their alleged negligence leading to the collapse of the airport roof.

University of Hyderabad

HYDERABAD: Cyberabad police registered a criminal case against six students of University of Hyderabad (UoH) for trying to take out a rally on Sunday. Gachibowli police said a case was registered against UoH students’ union president Abhishek Nandan and five others students.

On Republic Day, a section of the students wanted to take out ‘Save Constitution’ march from the campus to Ambedkar statue in Masjid Banda area. But, cops restrained the protesters by closing the university gate. In the melee, some of the students allegedly clashed with cops.

UOH Students Union said that police allegedly mishandled protesters. “The police without citing any valid reason threatened students and tried to detain few of them. They locked the main gate for 5 hours there by not allowing students to proceed with their rally,’’ students union said. The students also burnt effigies of varsity administration and the police for filing the FIR and detention of Chandra Shekar Azad.

Representative image

INDORE: Atal Indore City Transport Services Limited (AICTSL) may soon start issuing permits for e-rickshaws being run in city. Routes would soon be identified after survey to assess viability in areas that are not connected by public transport and permits for specific routes would be given.

The move is aimed at regulating routes of e-rickshaws being run by individuals to increase connectivity options of public transport for citizens, said officials on Monday.

There are around 1500 e-rickshaws including 100 that are being run under AICTSL in city. However, most of these e-rickshaws run on routes which already have availability of other passenger vehicles like buses, vans and rickshaws.

This prompted officials to plan for an arrangement, where e-rickshaw operators could be assigned certain routes to provide connectivity options for citizens from their respective localities to their nearby bus stops.

A final decision in this regard was taken on Monday convened at AICTSL Office on Monday.

IMC commissioner Asheesh Singh , who chaired the meeting instructed officials to send a proposal to state government seeking permission.

The commissioner also instructed AICTSL officials to conduct a survey and identify routes in residential and commercial areas, where there is no reach of city buses.

This arrangement would work in the same manner that it works for passenger vehicles like buses, vans, where their owners have to obtain permit from transport department to pick and drop passengers on different routes, said officials.

AICTSL chief executive officer Sandeep Soni said that if the proposal is approved by the government, then they will come out with an arrangement, where e-rickshaws operators will be allotted different routes or areas, where there is no availability of public transport.

“The entire idea is to provide last mile connectivity options of public transport service for citizens to improve traffic condition in city. We also have plans to introduce around 500 more e-rickshaws in city,” he said.

Ludhiana: Highlighting the shockingly callous attitude of the hospital staff, a 28-year-old pregnant woman was forced to deliver her baby outside the mother and childcare unit of civil hospital on Sunday. The baby had died on birth, said the mother. Allegedly, the hospital staff had not only told her that there was no doctor to attend to her, but they also refused to let her inside the labour room stating that she would “dirty it”.

Family members of the patient, Lalita Devi, and her neighbour alleged that even as she kept screaming in pain for hours on Sunday morning and kept walking to the labour room for help, the staff on duty kept turning her away. According to her family, around 11.30am on Sunday, she delivered a girl baby on the floor in the lobby of the mother and childcare unit.

According to the family, there wasn’t a single doctor present due to holiday. The family alleged that one staff nurse and two helpers, including a class-IV employee, were attending to the patients in the labour ward.

Lalita Devi, wife of Phool Chand from Durga Colony of Dhandari Kalan, said, “On Sunday morning, my contractions started and my neighbour had called the ambulance. We were taken to the mother and childcare unit of the civil hospital but the hospital staff refused to treat me. They said I will dirty the hospital. Following this, I slumped down on the floor and delivered a pre-mature baby, who died immediately.”

Urmila Devi, the neighbour of Lalita, said, “Some nurses were available inside the labour room, but no one bothered even though she kept on screaming. Soon her water broke, and she urinated and defecated in the visitor’s chair in the lobby. I went away to get her fresh clothes. During this time, she delivered a baby girl on the floor, which died later.”

“The way Lalita was screaming in pain, we thought hospital staff must be aware of the emergency, but they kept turning her away. When we started questioning them, they asked us to keep quiet and not make videos,” said Urmila.

Manjeet Singh, another neighbour of Lalita, said, “Lalita’s husband is a daily-wage worker and was busy in his work. He had asked me to look after his wife in the hospital. When I reached there, I was shocked to see the callous attitude of the hospital staff and how they had refused a pregnant woman entry into the labour room. I then called 104, the complaint number of the health department, for registering a complaint about the hospital staff.”

However, the hospital staff on duty have denied the allegations of their negligence.

Civil surgeon Rajesh Kumar Bagga said, “The matter of pre-mature delivery of a baby on the floor of mother and child hospital by a local woman came to my notice on Monday. Sometimes, labour contractions get intensive very quickly, this could be the case here, but I don’t know exactly. I will soon initiate an investigation into this to find out what exactly happened.”

Meanwhile, health and family welfare minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said, “I will soon initiate an inquiry into the matter. I will ask for a report on the complaint registered on helpline number 104.”

Ludhiana: The commissioner of police, Rakesh Agarwal, served forced retirement notices on 20 cops in January. While some of these cops were involved in crimes, others were found guilty of dereliction of duty.

On January 22, the city police had arrested assistant sub-inspector Sukhpal Singh, who was deputed at Jamalpur police station, in an attempt to murder case. The ASI, who was later forced to retire, had shot at his live-in partner with his service revolver at her house here.

During investigation, the police had found that the ASI was earlier booked under the Gambling Act at Division 6 police station.

On November 19, the Special Task Force had arrested constable Amandeep Singh, who was deputed at Police Lines, with 51gm heroin. After his arrest, the police identified that the constable had been absent from duty for a month. “However, his absence went unnoticed, with no official trying to probe into his long leaves,” said a cop.

Agarwal said, “After cops were arrested for their involvement in illegal activities, it was identified during investigations that most of them were either irregular on duty or had some other complaints or inquires marked against them. Now, we are checking the records of all cops, whether they have FIRs registered against them or are guilty of dereliction of duty.”

“This month, notices of forced retirement have been issued to 20 cops. These cops are from the ranks of constable to assistant sub-inspector. They include not just those personnel who were involved in criminal activities but also those guilty of dereliction of duty. They were issued notices after a thorough probe. After I joined as Ludhiana commissioner of police last year, 25 cops had been forced to retire or dismissed,” he added.

A 15-member team was in city for around 17 days for physical verification for seven-star protocol under Garbage Free Cities (GFC) component of survey. This team conducted extensive survey of every ward and collected 40 pictorial evidence from each ward. It also interviewed citizens and corporation staff to verify IMC’s claims on various parameters.

Another team from Centre came to city for field observation work under main survey of SS League 2020. This survey was conducted on different indicators such as beautification, encroachment on storm water drains and water bodies, level of dust in air, visible beautification in slum and old parts of city, presence of litter bins in markets, presence of stray animals etc. This team also shared personal observations on these parameters. “While star rating survey concluded on Jan 25, main survey concluded on Jan 26,” said sources. Corporation officials said that they did not have any role to play in the survey.

INDORE: Over 6000 driving licence applicants are running post to pillar to get their licence since more than past 20 days. The reason — Indore regional transport office ( RTO ) has stopped using conventional cards to print driving licence and officials claim that there is a delay in arrival of smart cards as recommended by the Centre.

The applicants include around 2500 people, who had applied for renewal or re-issuance of driving licence. Some applicants, who applied for licence in December are yet to receive licence.

“I had applied for renewal of my driving licence on December 10. I haven’t received the licence till date. Even officials concerned are not ready to explain reason behind this delay,” said Dev Kishan Nadda.

Trapti Goyal, who had applied for fresh licence on December 17, face the same problem. “Officials are not able to give a specific date about when I am going to get my driving licence issued. I passed the test, but I cannot drive because I don’t have licence,” she said.

Ministry of road transport and highways had earlier announced to modify format of driving licences to laminated cards without chip or smart card type driving licence.

It had prescribed a common standard format and design of driving licence for the whole country, which includes placement of information, standardization of fonts etc.

An instruction regarding implementation of the same was issued by department a month ago. Since then, agency engaged in printing of licence has stopped work.

Assistant regional transport officer Archana Mishra said that the matter has already been brought to the notice of authorities. “We are expecting new cards within a day or two. Once they are delivered we will start issuing licences,” she added.

TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu

AMARAVATI: TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu alleged that chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy decided to abolish the council only out of vengeance after the council chairman referred the three-capital cities and CRDA repeal bills to the select committee.

“TDP had given an opportunity to Duvvarapu Ramarao, who hails from most backward community Rajaka (washermen) as they never had any representation in the assembly. The council’s abolition would render great injustice to those unrepresented sections,” Naidu said.

He also found fault with the CM’s statement about the presence of intellectuals in the assembly. “About 86 YSRC legislators are facing criminal cases. They are a gang of s and thugs. They are not intellectuals. The YSRC enacted a drama even during voting on the resolution as the speaker’s first count was 121 and then increased to 133,” he alleged.

He further said that Jagan has been talking about only six states having councils but ignored the fact that 10 other states have requested for a revival of the council. “The CM is spending close to Rs 30 crore per year on his security to attend courts but expressing inability to spend on the council, which is laughable,” Naidu said.

Many TDP MLCs too termed the government’s decision to abolish the legislative council as “anti-poor”. Speaking to reporters after the assembly taking up discussion on the issue, TDP MLCs Duvvarapu Ramarao, BT Naidu, Tippe Swamy and Gourivani Srinivasulu demanded that the chief minister should explain how he plans to help people from the most backward communities to be part of the legislature after abolishing the council. “Many of us are from the most backward communities. We can’t contest direct elections due to our poor financial status. We got an opportunity to serve people only due to the presence of the council. Its abolition is a big blow to is,” said Ramarao.

He found fault with the government campaign that the council has been rejecting bills cleared by the assembly. Ramarao said the council cleared 32 bills sent by the assembly in the last few months and made amendments only to two bills — English medium in schools and SC-ST commissions. “We have not rejected the two bills. We have sent them back with amendments,” he said, while adding that the council chairman referred the capital decentralisation and CRDA repeal bills to the select committee only to take people’s views due to their controversial nature.

In fact, referring the bills to the select committee should not be construed as rejection, he said. “The chief minister has taken a unilateral decision to abolish the legislative body as he could not digest the presence of backward communities in the council,” he alleged.

Lingaraj Temple

BHUBANESWAR: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Monday announced a rehabilitation and resettlement policy for the Ekamra Plan that aims to revive and preserve the heritage value and grandeur of the historic Lingaraj Temple and its surroundings.

Under the plan, steps will be taken to preserve the heritage of around 66 acres surrounding the Lingaraj Temple and Bindu Sagar. The state government has already announced projects under the Ekamra Kshetra Amenities and Monuments Revival Action Plan worth around Rs 700 crore. The rehabilitation and resettlement policy is part of that action plan.

Besides government institutions, private land will be acquired while encroachment will also be removed from the area. As per the rehabilitation and resettlement policy, all residential and commercial units having clear title of the land would be acquired through direct purchase method prescribed by the state government while compensation will be given as per the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.

There shall be an option to provide land instead of compensation amount having equal market value of the land to be acquired. “Immediate assistance of Rs 1 lakh per family will be provided towards expenses related to transportation and immediate arrangements. Each family shall be provided with Rs 15,000 per month for a period of Rs 12 months from the date of acquisition of property,” said an official.

Also, every residential unit owner will be paid Rs 20 lakh as one-time settlement allowance over and above the compensation prescribed in the 2013 compensation law.

According to the policy, all commercial units having clear deed of the land will also be acquired through direct purchase method. Owners of commercial establishments will get allowance of Rs 1 lakh per unit towards expenses related to transportation. Monthly assistance of Rs 15,000 and Rs 20,000 will also be provided to shop owners having built up area of less than or equal to 200 square/feet and more than 200 square/feet, respectively, the package states.

The shop owners have also been given three options either to accept a shop unit at an available place at 50 per cent of the market value or to accept a shop at the new market complex to be developed on payment of 50 per cent cost. They can also opt for a one-time settlement amount of Rs 20 lakh.

The policy also said that the listed street vendors will be provided with a one-time rehabilitation assistance of Rs 30,000 in two instalments. A vending plan will be prepared to allocate space to the affected street vendors.

To assist affected government offices and institutions, a committee headed by the BMC commissioner will be formed to take a call on it. Similar method will also be applied to compensate religious institutions. State government sources said the rehabilitation and resettlement policy will be implemented by the BMC commissioner in consultation with the Khurda district collector.

HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Monday made it clear that it had only stayed the demolition of the existing secretariat building in Hyderabad in the past. The court added that this order will in no way prevents the state from preparing a new design for its proposed new secretariat complex.

The bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy said this while resuming the hearing in a batch of PILs that challenged the proposed move to demolish the existing secretariat building and raise a new one in its place.

The state counsel informed the bench that they are planning to raise the structure at a cost of Rs 300 crore to Rs 400 crore but could not prepare a plan so far on account of the stay.

The bench told him that they stayed only the demolition and not the work of preparing a new plan and design. The bench also wondered as to how the state counsel was pouring out the estimated costs of the building even without a plan on hand. The bench expressed its dissatisfaction over the incomplete affidavit filed by the principal secretary of the R&B department and sought a detailed counter from him by Feb 12.

AMARAVATI: TDP national general secretary and MLC Nara Lokesh said ministers Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose and Mopidevi Venkata Ramana should quit the cabinet after the decision to abolish the council.

Lokesh said both Bose and Ramana were representing the council in the cabinet and have lost the moral right to continue as ministers. Lokesh said all YSRC members in the council including chief whip Ummareddi Venkateswarlu should quit the council even before Parliament passes the bill to bring the abolition to effect.

“The cabinet and assembly have passed a resolution. How could YSRC members continue as members in the council when the party and the government have decided to abolish the Upper House?” asked Lokesh. He said that the two MLCs who switched sides to YSRC from TDP should also resign as they have lost the moral right to continue as members. Lokesh said Jagan had taken the call to abolish the council only out of vengeance against Amaravati. He said Jagan was acting against people and would taste their anger.

Former legislator Vangaveeti Radhakrishna said Jagan should dissolve the assembly if had the guts to face people. He visited the farmers’ dharna camp in the capital and extended his support. He said that Jagan would go to any extent to make his word final.

Panaji: Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC) has decided to take action against staffers who make requests backed by a minister or MLA to cancel their transfer orders or hold them in abeyance. The corporation, however, has not specificed what kind of action it will take.

During GTDC’s last board meeting, it was pointed out that the phemonenon of staffers approaching MLAs and ministers to cancel their transfer orders hampers the smooth functioning of the corporation.

Thus, it passed a resolution, signed by MD Nikhil Desai, that stated “the need to curb such practices adopted by staff of the corporation”.

A GTDC board member, however, said that it’s not an easy practice to stop. “Who will bell the cat?” he asked. “The practice is widespread and common in other departments too. Going to an elected representative is the easiest way to get a transfer order reversed, or to get a transfer to a preferable location.”

Another board member said it would be interesting to see what kind of action would be taken against staffers who resort to applying political pressure.“Most (officials) comply when a request is received from a political boss, lest they have to pay the price for not obliging,” he said. The GTDC, incorporated under the Companies Act, is governed by rules applicable for government servants.

A senior official said that a government employee can be transferred to any part of the state, and they have to adhere to it. “Elected representatives should not entertain such requests just because the staffer happens to be their constituent,” the official said.

Kolkata: The anti-CAA protests around Republic Day celebrations spilled over to Monday on campuses across the city.

Students formed a human chain and read the Preamble to the constitution. The precincts of Presidency University reverberated with the preamble to the constitution on Monday evening as more than 200 students of the institution formed a human chain to protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the proposed National Register for Citizens.

The students of the university have been protesting on various forums and participating in protest meetings even outside campus demanding a roll back of CAA.

The call for Monday’s human chain was given by the Presidency University Unit of Students’ Federation of India but several other students too joined in.

“We are celebrating Republic day by protesting against the draconian CAA which discriminates on the basis of religion. The law is anti-poor and anti-marginalised communities. The students will keep protesting will the law is not repealed,” said Debnil Paul of the history department.

After reading the Preamble to the constitution, the students formed a human chain that stretched from the main gate till the other end of the portico.

At Jadavpur University, young poet Amir Aziz recited several poems of dissent. His poem Jamia ki larkiya has gone viral. He spoke to close to 300 students of the university on Monday afternoon.

“They are dividing people so that nobody asks them the uncomfortable questions about jobs, education, safety of women and children. This is why they have brought CAA and proposing NRC . The secular fabric of this nation is in danger,” said Aziz.

On Sunday Republic day was observed at all the five sit-in spots in Kolkata and Howrah with hoisting of the national flag followed by the national anthem.

At Zakaria Street, local people along with students took out a procession from Nakhoda Mosque to Jorasanko to observe the Republic Day. The rallyists carried the national flag and posters against the CAA and NRC.

“Nakhoda Mosque and Jorasanko are not merely landmarks but a symbol of love and amity between the several communities that reside in Kolkata. CAA and NRC are an attempt to divide the people on religious lines but the citizens of the country will foil such attempts by the BJP,” said Angshuman Sarkar, a student who participated in the rally.

At Park Circus the national flag was hoisted at 11 am. “Hundreds of people attended the Republic day celebration here. Throughout the day we had several programmes celebrating this beautiful republic we call our country,’ said a volunteer at Park Circus. Even on Sunday, several homemakers were present at Park Circus Maidan to celebrate Republic Day. “We started the day with hoisting the National Flag and singing the National Anthem. We went to participate in the human chain after that,” said Bilqis Begum, a homemaker from Rippon Street.

At the sit-in at Nawab Ali Park in Ekbalpore, a health check-up camp was organised for over 500 people. “Many members participated in the human chain while others organised a small Republic Day programme at the park itself. In the later half of the day we organised a health camp for over 500 people. We are planning to organise more camps like these in the coming days,” said Arshad Parvez Khan, one of the organisers.

The sit-in near Chaplin Square on Hogg Street attracted more than 1,000 people on Republic Day. “Several activists dropped by to address the gathering which listened with rapt attention,” said Amitava Ghosh, a member of the Joint Forum against NRC.

At Howrah’s Pilkhana several students from local colleges staged a small play and raised slogans against CAA and NRC along with the local people.

Taking the arguments of the petitioner into consideration, the AP high court bench headed by the chief justice J K Maheswari and Justcie Nainala Jayasurya directed the state election commission to take action according to the law and asked to it file an affidavit over the issue and posted the matter for further hearing on February 5.

LUDHIANA: The police on Saturday booked two men for raping a married woman and two women for helping the accused commit the crime. Later in the day, one of the accused was arrested.

In her police complaint, the 22-year-old survivor said, “A woman and her daughter-in-law, who live in my neighbourhood, are my family friends. Around 8pm on January 25, the woman called me up and asked me to meet her at Tajpur Road. When I reached Tajpur Road, she, along with her daughter-in-law, was waiting for me. From there, we boarded an autorickshaw and reached Transport Nagar.”

The trio then went to the accused women’s tea shop. “The woman’s son and his friend were at the shop. A few minutes later, the woman and her daughter-in-law left, saying they would return soon. On finding me alone, her son and his friend started harassing me. They then raped me and threatened me against speaking about the incident,” she added.

On returning home, she apprised her husband of the incident and he took her to the police station to lodge a complaint.

Citizen's feedback is one parametre that helps the city to score more marks and top the cleanest city ranking

COIMBATORE: S Thangasubha , a resident of Race Course , was doing household chores when three sanitary workers of the city corporation knocked on her door on Monday morning.

They had come to conduct a survey about the city’s cleanliness, the workers told the 29-year-old woman and sought her mobile number. Within seconds, Thangasubha received a one-time password. The workers asked her to share the OTP, which she did. They thanked her and asked her to give her husband’s mobile number. They left the place after getting the OTP sent to his number.

Thangasubha had no clue what it was about. “As the workers used to collect garbage from my house and inspect the house during the anti-dengue drive, I knew them well. That’s why I shared the mobile numbers and OTPs. When I demanded to know what they were doing, they said it was for a survey and left the place in a hurry, saying that they had to meet targets,” she told TOI.

It took some time for Ramanthapuram-based Murugan, who also shared his mobile number and OTP, to realise that he had let the workers complete Swachh Survekshan 2020 on his behalf. “Not even once the sanitary workers collected waste from our doorstep. Garbage bins in the locality are cleared only once in five days. As a result, stay dogs thrive here,” he said.

“What is the point of achieving high marks in the survey without implementing anything on the ground? I don’t mind giving full marks to the city corporation if it would have at least shown willingness to keep the city clean,” Murugan said.

But the workers said they were also kept in the dark about the exercise. “We would gladly explain about the survey only if we knew what it was about. Our supervisors had obtained our mobile numbers, answered the questions on their own and completed the survey by entering the OTPs. We are doing it because we were asked to do so,” a permanent worker of the corporation said.

The corporation has been adopting a similar procedure to record the most number of feedback from residents for the survey, conducted by the ministry of housing and urban affairs. Public were asked to rate their city for eight parameters, including whether dry waste and wet waste are segregated at source and cleanliness of community toilets.

According to the Swachh Survekshan portal, the city corporation has obtained 89,211 votes 16,199 registered through the portal and validated through OTP, 72,643 through Vote for Your City app and 369 through Swachhata app to get the most number of votes in the state.

Citizens’ feedback is one of the parameters that help the city score more marks and top the cleanest city ranking, a corporation official said. “Corporation officials along with Swachh Bharat ambassadors have been creating awareness about the survey in educational institutions. Field-level workers have been distributing pamphlets and making people fill the survey at their doorstep.”

Public participation is important than the marks, said R Raveendran, one of the ambassadors. “During the drive at colleges, we explain about the importance about the survey and about the questionnaire. We don’t interfere with their right to vote.”

A senior corporation official refuted the allegation. “Cleanliness of the city has improved significantly in the last few months, thanks to the cleaning drives conducted during night.

111,['28/01/2020'],Odisha nod likely for driving licence applicants to upload documents,"This story is from January 28, 2020

BHUBANESWAR: The state transport department is going to launch an online platform to enable DL (driving licence ) applicants to upload requisite documents online. Though applicants currently apply for the DL online, they have to carry documents like age and address proofs (original and photocopy) physically to the regional transport office (RTO) and submit them to the authorities.

“Our online application is almost ready. We are likely to launch it in next few days. In the proposed initiative, all DL-related documents can be uploaded online, preventing any paperwork in the regional transport offices,” said state transport commissioner Sanjeeb Panda.

The department said the proposed online facility, dubbed as document management system , is part of the state government’s 5T (transparency, teamwork, technology, timeframe and transformation) initiative for faster service delivery and improved user experience.

An official in a regional transport office said the document management system will ease their pressure. “We are now examining documents and accepting photocopies of the documents from the applicants. Soon, applicants are just required to approach us with their appointment letter and original documents. We will not receive any documents. We will only match the uploaded documents with their original ones,” another officer said.

A few days ago, the transport department launched instant online learners licence (LL) by scrapping the system of approval by the RTOs to issue LL to applicants, who successfully clear the computerised test. An official source said a staggering 7.9 lakh LLs were issued by RTOs across the state between September 2019 and December 2019. Interestingly, only 3.48 lakh LLs were issued across the state in 2018.

“We also recorded substantial increase in online collection of revenue in RTOs through Sarathi online application. Under the 5T policy, we have already introduced single receipt system of collecting the service charges of private service provider at RTOs along with the government fees,” an officer said.

State transport authority said the recent removal of middlemen from the premises of regional transport offices and massive awareness drives resulted in smooth and transparent delivery of services to people. There is a plan to install computers with touchscreen facility at RTOs for convenience of applicants, who are not conversant with computer mouse . Attempts are also being made to install such touchscreen computers for mock test for LL applicants. All applicants can try a mock test before sitting for the main LL test, said an official.

112,['28/01/2020'],Foresters remove deer killed by wild dogs near village,"This story is from January 28, 2020

The deer was hunted by a pack of wild dogs near Mudholi on Friday

Nagpur: Should a wild animal killed by predators be removed by the forest department ? The question was raised by conservationists after Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) forest officials lifted a deer killed by wild dogs. The foresters, though, claim it was necessitated since stray feral dogs were eating the kill, and may have passed on some infections to the wild dogs.

Eyewitnesses said the deer was hunted by a pack of wild dogs on Friday near Mudholi, in protected forest under Tadoba buffer. The forest is contiguous to the core area and the prey was chased over a long distance by the dogs.

However, owing to morning chores of local villagers, the kill was left at the site. When foresters came to know about it, they removed the fresh deer carcass and conducted post-mortem and disposed it of.

Deputy director (buffer) G Guruprasad confirmed the deer was killed by wild dogs. “We removed the carcass as feral dogs from the village had moved in to eat it. With the fear that it would infect the wild dogs or any other predators, we did not take a risk. The spot where the deer was killed was hardly 200 metres away from the village.”

Conservationists working in and around Tadoba said, “This is against nature. Ideally, the forest officials should have monitored the kill by making a machan, or the deer could have been shifted into the forest area, instead of disposing it of. By removing the deer, wild dogs were deprived of their food.”

National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) does not have guidelines for such cases. “With regard to cattle kills, there are directions to monitor them because people many times resort to revenge killing of predators by poisoning the cattle. There are many incidents where tigers have been killed due to poisoning of cattle,” said experts.

The detour is expected to ease traffic snarls on the Cortalim stretch

PANAJI: By the end of February 2020, commuters can finally expect to be relieved from the frequent traffic congestion presently plaguing Cortalim junction. Dilip Buildcon has finally received the required clearance from the forest department and work on the service road from Cortalim junction to RK Marbles in Thane has begun. Once traffic is diverted via this service road, it will also enable work on the superstructure of the eight-lane Zuari bridge to progress at a faster pace, said officials of Dilip Buildcon, contractors for the massive project.

Work of levelling the ground for the 2.5km-long Cortalim service road is already under way. “The work was on hold because of pending clearance from the forest department. They have now given the clearance and we have started constructing the service road. It should be ready for use within a month,” said Atul Joshi, vice-president (constructions), Dilip Buildcon.

The contractor had asked for traffic to be diverted on the Cortalim stretch during the advanced stages of construction of the new Zuari bridge in view of the safety of commuters during the construction.

Once traffic is diverted via this road, it will increase travel distance from Panaji to Margao route by around 2.5km. Plans for this service road were first finalised in December 2018, but work has started only now, 13 months later. The two-lane service road, estimated to cost Rs 18 crore, will run parallel to the railway line.

While the bridge has been paid for by the Union ministry of road transport and highway (MoRTH), the state government has to fund this diversion.

Officials said that once the four-lane highway expansion work on the Cortalim stretch is over, this two-lane service road, to be built on land leased from Konkan Railways, is likely to continue as an alternative route.

The decision to create the service road was taken under Manohar Parrikar’s tenure as CM, but the road kept hitting multiple hurdles.

Coimbatore: Two months after turning the Big Bazaar Road and Raja Street at Town Hall colourful by implementing tactical urbanism on pilot basis to improve facilities for pedestrians and cyclists, German company Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH submitted a permanent design for the stretch to the city corporation on Monday.

“The permanent design was made based on the feedback received during the 14-day-long trail period from commuters. The designs were made keeping the historical significance of the stretch and it would resemble the existing structure and design. We have also requested the corporation to arrange a stakeholders’ meeting. During the meet, the design will be presented and feedback will also be incorporated,” said Ranjith Parvathapuram, urban transport expert with GIZ.

“We have given a facelift to the clock tower and provided tabletop crossing at the junctions. Tabletop crossing would ensure safety of pedestrians. We propose to remove the dead space between the shops and the bus stop by integrating them. Also, with the help of corporation officials, we will identify intersections that are to be redesigned. There are 80 such intersections in the city. As it is difficult to redesign all the intersections, we are in talks with the stakeholders to identify 10 to 15 critical intersections,” Parvathapuram said.

The firm had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the city corporation to implement integrated sustainable urban transport systems for smart cities (SMART-SUT) project in the city. As part of the initiative, 300 kilometres of non-motorized transport routes and 26 pedestrian activity centres were identified. The project is estimated to cost Rs 1,700 crores to be implemented in five phases in 15 years.

Vijayawada: Vijayawada Municipal Corporation’s (VMC) proposal to classify apartments as bulk garbage generators is sparking controversy.

The civic body is eyeing to engage special agencies to collect waste from bulk garbage generators. Residents of apartments and residential colony welfare organisations are gearing up to agitate against the move.

VMC which is focused on improving sanitation in the city has started implementing door-to-door garbage collection.

Taxpayers association strongly condemned the proposal of classifying apartments as bulk waste generators. MV Anjaneyulu, secretary of the association said Vijayawada Municipal Corporation was shirking its responsibilities.

“Each and every flat in the apartment is classified as a separate assessment. Each and every flat owner is paying property and other taxes to the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation.

Engaging private agencies to collect garbage from apartments will be a huge burden on the inhabitants of the residential complexes. “We will not let this happen at any cost,” he said.

Left parties urged VMC to withdraw the decision on classifying apartments as bulk garbage generators.

VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Monday directed the state and Union government to file affidavits in the PIL challenging the introduction of English medium in all government schools from primary level.

The chief spokesperson of BJP, Andhra Pradesh , Srinivasa Sudhish Rambotla and one Guntupalli Srinivas from Eluru had moved the high court challenging the state government’s decision.

The petitioners argued that government order 85 issued by the school education department is in violation of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009.

Rambotla argued that the state government cannot make any law in contravention with the central law. Moreover, the right to select the medium of instruction should be with the children and they should not be forced to take English medium, he stated. While the state government sought more time to file the counter, the petitioners’ advocate claimed that the government is going ahead with the implementation of GO 85 and public money is being spent to print textbooks. Responding to the petitioners argument, the high court said that they would recover the costs from the officials concerned if the need arises and posted the matter for hearing on February 4.

Nagpur: What would you do if a tiger suddenly appears before you? Well, it is the tiger that will decide, not you. Virendra Dayaram Sahare (45) of Sindpuri had a horrifying experience when a tiger pounced on him, but left him alive on Friday.

The video showing a tiger grabbing Sahare went viral on Friday, sending a chill down the spine of viewers. The incident occurred in Binaki when the tiger was being chased by an unruly mob of villagers. Binaki is 5km away from Sindpuri. And the question doing the rounds is, what was Sahare doing there?

Narrating his ordeal to TOI from his hospital bed in Bhandara district, Sahare, a marginal farmer, said, “I had never seen a tiger in my life. While returning from Bapera, where I had gone to procure ‘dhan’ rice, I saw a crowd making a big noise to chase the tiger out. The beast was in the bushes on the other side of the road. It had already attacked one villager.”

“I was curious to sight the tiger. After parking my two-wheeler near a farm, I chose the isolated farm bund to have a glimpse of it. There were two more persons there. Even as the crowd shouted, the furious tiger came out and crossed the road and straightway headed towards the farm bund where I was standing,” recalled Sahare.

“The two persons standing near me vanished, but before I could gather myself, the tiger pounced on me and within seconds I was brought down. The tiger sat on my back, grabbing me with his paws. I didn’t panic and the one sensible thing that I did was to lower my head downwards and hold it with both hands so that the tiger doesn’t catch my neck,” said Sahare.

As the crowd, with stones in their hands, turned towards the tiger, it left Sahare and ran away. “I tried getting up but couldn’t as I suffered deep bruises on my back. Due to the weight of the tiger on my body, I also suffered a fracture on my right leg and injuries on the hand. After primary treatment in Sihora, I was shifted to Bhandara,” the victim said.

“There is myth that a cat has nine lives, but I have only one and by God’s grace, I was back from the jaws of death. It’s like a rebirth for me. The one who is guarded by God cannot be killed by anyone. Or else, can you ever imagine freeing yourself from the clutches of a tiger, considered the most ferocious and powerful animal?,” added Sahare.

His condition is said to be stable. The poor farmer, who owns 1.5-acre agriculture land, has a wife named Meena, son Dinesh, who is studying in Std XII and daughter Pallavi, a student of class XI.

“We will provide help to the three persons who were injured in the tiger attack. People are responsible for the mess as the drama continued from 12 noon till 7pm. The tiger had made a kill and had the villagers given it a safe passage, it would have left. The horrifying video also conveys the message that the tiger attacked Sahare in self-defence and the motive was not to kill him,” said Bhandara deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) Vivek Hoshing.

AGRA: A man who was appointed as junior assistant clerk in the basic education department on compassionate grounds in 2018 after his first wife’s death was allegedly caught red-handed by the Anti-Corruption Bureau sleuths for taking Rs 6,000 as bribe from an assistant teacher on the pretext of releasing his pending arrear papers.

The accused was identified as Rahul Gupta, 37, a resident of sector-7 Awas Vikas Colony under Jagdispura police station. He was nabbed from Avantibai intersection under the jurisdiction of Fatehabad police, at around 2:20 pm while counting notes which were marked by ACB, Agra unit.

A complaint was lodged on January 25 with ACB Agra unit by one Bhola Singh, 38, an assistant teacher posted at the government primary school in Puragugran Brahman village, Fatehabad block.

Speaking with TOI, Bhola Singh said, “Rahul Gupta was demanding a bribe in order to release the papers of eight months of pending arrears, which is around Rs 3 lakh. Initially, he demanded 10% of the total arrear. Later, he agreed on Rs 6,000 cash. I decided to expose him, and contacted ACB unit of Agra in charge, inspector Jaspal Singh Pawar , who helped me to catch the corrupt junior assistant clerk.”

Inspector Mahesh Chandra Gautam, member of the ACB unit that caught the accused clerk, said, “After Rahul’s first wife Gunjan’s death supposedly due to brain hemorrhage in 2012, he got a government job on compassionate ground in September 2018. He was married with Gunjan for four years. Later, he married another woman, a teacher in a private school. Technically, after the second marriage, the basic education department should have removed him from the job, but he continued in the post by allegedly hiding his marital status from the department.”

Gautam added, “We received inputs about him on asking for a bribe from the department’s employee on the pretext of releasing his documents and finally, managed to arrest him.”

At the time of filing this report, ACB was filing an FIR against him at Fatehabad police station.

AGRA: A special investigation team led by Firozabad SP (rural) Rajesh Kumar, which is probing the December 20 violence, has claimed that autopsy reports of five out of seven men killed in anti-CAA violence in the district confirmed their death due to bullet injuries. The other two victims had laceration wounds.

According to police, the men died of gunshot were Mohammad Shafeeq (45), Armaan (24), Mohammad Haroon (33), Nabi Jaan (22) and Mukim (20), while Rashid (33) and Mohammad Abrar (28) succumbed to other injuries.

TOI accessed three autopsy reports, including that of Mohammad Shafeeq, Armaan and Mohammad Abrar. Two of the victims – Mohammad Shafeeq, whose postmortem was conducted by doctors at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, and Armaan, whose autopsy was conducted by doctors at Firozabad’s district hospital, stated that duo had suffered bullet wounds (entry) of 2.8x1cm and 1x1cm, respectively. While in the case of Mohammad Abrar, no bullet injury was mentioned in the report. It just stated “laceration wound 4x2cm bone deep over the upper vertebral column. Peeling off skin and bad sore present extensively over the back of shoulder, buttocks and both thighs”.

Speaking with TOI, Abdul Mutalib (22), younger brother of Abrar, said, “My brother had suffered bullet injury in his spinal cord and was operated at Delhi’s Apollo Hospital after the intervention of Delhi government, but post-mortem report conducted by Firozabad doctors makes no mention of bullet injury. The autopsy report has flaw and I don’t accept it.”

When contacted, Firozabad SP Sachindra Patel said, “All the cases are under investigation by specially constituted special investigation team (SIT).”

Talking to TOI, SIT head and SP (rural) Rajesh Kumar said, “The autopsy reports claims only five died of gunshot injuries, while two had laceration wounds. Since not a single bullet was recovered from the victims’ bodies, we have asked the forensic team to investigate, as what kind of weapon was used to shoot the victims.”

Meanwhile, SP (city) Prabal Pratap Singh said, “I have not seen all the autopsy reports but I knew that six men had suffered bullet injuries, but if SIT has found that only five had suffered bullet injuries, then their finding is more authentic.”

COIMBATORE: The wife of a 29-year-old man, who suffered brain death due to an accident when he was rushing her to a hospital for delivery, agreed to donate nine of his organs on Sunday.

On Thursday, V Gowtham, 29, an engineer, was driving his wife Manimekalai, 26, who was in severe labour pain, from N Ganapathy Palayam, in Tirupur to KMCH in Sulur in a car. When they were driving through Mettukkadu, Gowtham collided head-on with another four-wheeler.

“Gowtham suffered head injuries but Manimekalai, who was pregnant, did not suffer any major injuries,” a KMCH spokesperson said. Both were rushed to KMCH, Sulur.

While Manimekalai managed to deliver her baby via C-section the same evening, Gowtham was transferred to KMCH Avinashi Road for specialized treatment, where doctors desperately tried to release the pressure in his skull. However, he did not respond to treatment. From Saturday evening, doctors began performing the sleep apnea tests.

On Sunday, doctors declared him brain dead. Gowtham’s wife and parents Viswanathan and Samundiswari were informed. The couple had not even celebrated their first anniversary, which falls in February.

“Manimekalai who is understandably devastated was the most receptive initially, when the option of donating his organs came up. It was she who kept repeating that at least her husband’s organs can keep other people alive instead of it going waste,” said one of their relatives, Selvaraj. On Sunday afternoon, the family agreed to donate his organs.

On Monday, teams from four hospitals, across two cities, began the surgery to harvest the organs from Gowtham’s body.

126,['28/01/2020'],Kolkata: Priests to turn social pivots in ‘trying times’,"The Preamble being read out at Christ the King Church on Republic Day

KOLKATA: A three-day annual meet of Catholic priests started on Monday to discuss how they should reinvent their roles “in these difficult times.” Every year, priests of the churches under the archdiocese of Kolkata attend the annual meet to discuss church-related issues but this year is different since the church leadership is looking at how individual priests can take on the roles of social pivots in their respective parishes.While the first two days will see discussions on church-related issues like lack of priests, the last day will have an open house where citizenship-related issues and how priests should dispel fears among the poor and illiterate people are likely to come up.Both the Roman Catholic church and the Church of North India (CNI) have taken lead roles in leading the anti-CAA/NRC movement in the city. They have both taken to the streets in mobilising support for the Constitution and have pledged to stand by all those whose citizenship claim might come under question despite their domicile and other bona fide status. The Preamble has been read in churches. Churches have also played a key role in the United Interfaith-organised human chain across the city in support of the Constitution.“The role of a priest is to talk to the poor and insecure people residing within his parish and assure them of support. So during the meet, when the conversation naturally moves towards the issue of the fear rhetoric, will will remind the priest of his added responsibilities at such times and how he should take the poor and insecure of all faiths under his wing,” said archbishop Thomas D’Souza. He added that every priest should treat all people residing within his parish equally and should not only cater to the Christians.The meet is taking place at Proggaloy, a training centre for Catholic priests at Barasat. “We will listen to the issues of individual churches of different parishes that are typical of such meets and try to look for solutions but we will have to look at the bigger picture too,” said vicar general Dominic Gomes, who had taken the lead role in getting Preambles printed and circulated to be read inside churches after Mass on Republic Day.Father Rodney of Loyola Church felt that since his church is located in Kidderpore, he interacts a lot with people from minority communities and has been working towards dispelling doubts and fears in their minds. “We hope this meet brings further clarity about our roles in these times because people of all communities look up to us for support,” he said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73690495,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-129925,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/priests-to-turn-social-pivots-in-trying-times/articleshow/73676320.cms

MEERUT: An advisory issued by the health department after three cases of swine flu were reported in Meerut city has returned spotlight on the deadly disease after a hiatus of some months. With three cases reported in the first month of the year, the health department is making sure all their arrangements are complete.

According to details provided by the health department, the first case in Meerut, reported on Thursday, was of a 62-year-old man. Next day, his 28-year-old son was also diagnosed positive. The elderly man was detected with symptoms that were eventually detected as swine flu, had just returned from Roorkee, where he had gone for a wedding a few days ago. Both of them live in Sadar . The third case was reported from Phool Bagh Colony on Saturday.

“An advisory has been issued in the matter and all residents have been asked to report any symptoms directly to the doctor. Meanwhile, private hospitals have been asked to make isolation wards for patients with swine flu. This is because many private hospitals put Swine Flu patients in ICU with other patients, despite our instructions that the disease is communicable and patients should be kept in isolation wards. This is not correct, and so, all private hospitals have been asked to make separate wards for swine flu, to ensure that neither other patients nor hospital staffs get infected,” said Dr Raj Kumar, chief medical officer, Meerut.

The last case of swine flu reported in Meerut was on October 17, 2019. A total of 399 cases of swine flu were reported in 2019, against 24 cases in 2018.

Areas where the swine flu affected live are being surveilled to check if there are more, unknown cases. Awareness camps are also being organised in these places so that people in these areas can exercise caution. Also, epidemiological study and travel history of patients is being checked, said health department authorities.

128,['28/01/2020'],‘Nothing more rewarding if one’s passion-driven achievement makes country feel proud of you’,"This story is from January 28, 2020

The Crypto Price Tracker is a portfolio management and price tracking tool for cryptocurrencies that does price tracking and customizable alerts. It tracks the prices of over 1,000 cryptocurrencies from over 18 exchanges in 32 fiat currencies. It also provides price charts for all monitored cryptocurrencies during the last one day, one week, one month, three months, and one year.

Meerut: At just 18, this Saharanpur girl who home–schooled herself has PM Narendra Modi tweeting about her achievements, “I am delighted that the very talented Harshita Arora has been conferred the Bal Shakti Puraskar 2020….” She is the proud recipient of Bal Shakti Puruskar (Innovation category) for developing a number of apps, including the Crypto Price Tracker – a best-selling app in Canada and the US, and a food app. She is also a co-founder of a $9 million dollar startup funded by renowned venture capitalists.

Currently living in San Francisco on O-1 visa, granted to only those who demonstrate extraordinary ability by achieving international acclaim, Harshita flew down to India after learning she had been selected for the award.

This self-taught innovator dropped out of school when she was 14 as she was “not cut out for common courses” to pursue her dream of developing apps. When she was 16, she was conferred upon ‘Woman of the Year Award’ in Toronto in Canada at the CryptoChicks Hackathon Conference.

Daughter of a local financer and a homemaker mother, Harshita is now aspiring to graduate from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to “gain enough knowledge to work on Brain Computer Interface (BCI)”.

“There is nothing more rewarding if one’s passion-driven achievement makes your country feel proud of you. This award (Bal Shakti Puruskar) is a reflection of that. And, Prime Minister Modi acknowledging that. What more can you ask for? He congratulated me and asked me where I was from,” Harshita said after the PM gave her the award.

After meeting her, Modi on Friday tweeted about Harshita, “She has been focussing on a wide range of sectors. Her passion towards science, technology and human welfare is clearly visible.”

Harshita was just 16 when the app that updates users about price fluctuations in more than 1,000 cryptocurrencies in 32 countries had become one of the most sought-after paid apps on Apple’s App store.

The first time she heard about cryptocurrencies was in 2016. She soon got into Bitcoin mining, the basic underlying technology and cryptography. Not that the sudden stardom has come easy. When Harshita introduced the iOS app, she was at the receiving end of a lot of cynicism, with some doubting that a girl of her age could build an iOS platform like that and others accusing her of plagiarizing the app. All that is behind her now.

Harshita told TOI, “Ever since I was 13 and was introduced to designing concepts, I began reading IT magazines and the latest developments in the field. I learned about cryptocurrency and how it worked. Then I interacted with my internet friends and real investors in the currency to understand what they wanted in an app.

Soon enough I undertook a four-week MIT Launch , a (a high school entrepreneur programme) which helped me a lot.” This was a four-week long entrepreneurship programme for people between 15 and 19 years of age.

At present, Harshita is developing a sustainable transportation commuting app which will work in San Francisco and nearby areas and is the co-founder of the startup.

Agra: The ex-student of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) who was arrested on Sunday for shouting slogans against the VC along with some other students at the official Republic Day function, was released on bail on Monday.

Ahmad Mujtaba Faraz was granted bail after two AMU faculty members — Prof Mohammad Mohibul Haque and Prof Imrana Naseem — stood surety for him. Earlier on Sunday night, students who were protesting for Faraz’s release at Chungi gate ended their dharna after being assured of support by faculty members.

On Sunday, four students were detained by police after the varsity’s proctor team handed them over to cops for raising slogans against the vice-chancellor, when he began addressing the gathering at the official Republic Day function on campus. The students were identified as Tahir Azmi and Siddhartha Gulati from the engineering department, BA student Rafiuddin and ex-student Ahmad Mujtaba Faraz.

Later in the evening, police released the current students, while Faraz was sent to judicial remand under Section 151 of CrPc, for creating disturbance. The students had shouted “Go back” as the VC began his Republic Day speech, to protest against his not protecting students and allowing police inside campus on December 15, which left several students injured. AMU students have been demanding the VC’s resignation ever since.

The students detained on Sunday alleged that the proctor team had manhandled them, and that some anti-socials had also attacked them. They claimed that instead of protecting varsity students, the proctor team took handed them over to police.

When the news spread on campus, scores of students, including women, gathered outside the proctor’s office and shouted slogans, “Yeh jo dehshatgardi hai, uske peeche vardi hai (police terror is behind the fear among students)”.

Nagpur: Hypertension and heart troubles have become so common these days that people relate every chest pain to heart attack. While chest pain can be one of the prime symptoms of heart attack, every chest pain is not going to land your heart in trouble. On Saturday, cardiologist Dr Rhishikesh Umalkar explained how patients can evaluate chest pain and keep themselves risk free in any situation with proper use of ‘loading dose’.

“Chest pain should never be ignored. Sometimes it can be a non-cardiac chest pain . In case it radiates to the shoulders, arms or jaw, it could be a sign of heart attack. It’s always better to identify the type of pain and rush to the doctor for proper treatment,” said Dr Umalkar.

According to him, if chest pain is accompanied by chest tightness, squeezing, heaviness, or a crushing sensation, one should not wait for the echocardiogram (ECG) and get the loading dose which is must for dissolving clot.

“ECG detects heart movements at least one hour late. It’s always better not to wait and go for the loading dose. It has no side effect. I suggest physicians and diabetologist to keep the loading dose ready in their clinics,” Dr Umalkar said.

He also suggested that family history, habits like smoking, obesity, elevated cholesterol and diabetes are risk factors for heart attacks.

Umalkar was speaking at a continuing medical education (CME) event on new drugs in diabetes and hypertension, organized on Saturday by Indian Medical Association (IMA) Nagpur chapter.

Diabetologist Dr Himanshu Patil said that new drug combination for type 2 diabetes not only controls sugar but also reduces weight.

“Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are newest glucose-lowering agents. Both classes have showed a cardiovascular protection along with sugar control. So, patients with type 2 diabetes along with high cardiovascular risk should be prescribed these new medicines,” he said and added that these medicines prove very effective, especially in the long-term treatment of diabetes and hypertension.

BIJNOR: The women from Bijnor’s Rampur Thakra village protested, on Monday, over notices sent to them to vacate their village as the land they are living on reportedly belongs to the forest department. Interestingly, this is the same area where UP CM Yogi Adityanath flagged off the Ganga Yatra.

This comes even as the Allahabad High Court has ruled in favour of the forest department, which claimed that the land on the banks of Ganga where the villagers live belongs to Hastinapur sanctuary and reserve forest area.

In the final minutes of CM’s speech at Ganga Barrage, a dozen of women and children suddenly got up and started raising slogans such as ‘Yogi Adityanath jindabad, humari mange puri karo’. They were voicing their concerns as they have been served notices several times to vacate the village land. The officers at the venue tried to stop them. They gave assurance to look into their demands.

Notably, Rampur Thakara village is located around 10 km from Bijnor city on the banks of Ganga River. The village comprises a population of around 600 with its own school, government road and power connections. Around 80% people are from schedule caste here.

Villagers avail of all government facility. They have a pradhan as well. This village falls under Salempur Mathana village and part of Hastinapur sanctuary area. Primarily farmers, the families also own nearly 66 hectare (726 bighas) of agricultural land which is said to be of forest land.

According to officials, the village in the sanctuary area was declared “illegal” in 2011. The forest department served notices to farmers who were engaged in farming on the 66 hectare of land here. Forest authorities had asked them not to do any farming for now. The village is said to be 40 years old but because of its location in sanctuary area, it has been declared “illegal”. Even the HC has given clear instructions in this matter.

The park funded by the Saharanpur Development Authority has around 74 species of various host plants for attracting butterflies, a water body, a gazebo and a trail of around 1,200 meters. The plants here shall bloom within next three months and we expect them to be attract over 70 species of butterflies.”

Kumar further said it shall serve as an eco-learning place for all who visit the park. Earlier, Lucknow and Kanpur in UP have to their credit one butterfly park each. Butterflies and moths are symbols of a quality, healthy and green ecosystem. They are an important part of the food chain and help in pollinating flowers.

It should be noted that the Company Park was renamed Subhas Chandra Park on the 124th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose on January 23.

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi

MUZAFFARNAGAR: BJP MLA from Khatauli Vikram Saini , known for making controversial remarks, hit a new low on Monday when he referred to Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi as someone “who is roaming around and visiting stoke-pelters at their homes and saying ‘koi patthar se na mare mere diwane ko’.” He was referring to Gandhi’s recent visits to the homes of the victims of the anti-CAA protests.

Saini was speaking at a public rally which was also addressed by UP CM Yogi Adityanath a while later in Muzaffarnagar as a part of the state government’s five-day Ganga Yatra.

In August last year, a day after the Centre moved to scrap special privileges to J&K under Article 370, Saini had said that Muslims in the country should be happy that they can now marry “gori” Kashmiri girls without any fear. He added that bachelors in BJP are now welcome to go to Kashmir, buy plots of land and get married.

In February, the MLA had offered to go to Pakistan with a nuclear bomb attached to him and destroy the neighbouring country.

The same month, he also said at a public function, ""I have told my wife to keep producing more children, although she had told me that two were enough.""

A month earlier in January, he had said, “Those who feel unsafe in this country are anti-nationals and do not deserve to live. Give me a ministry and I'll attach a bomb to their posteriors and blast them.”

COIMBATORE: About a kilogram of hair was removed from the stomach of a 13-year-old girl at VGM Gastro Centre in the city recently.

A few days ago, the girl, a resident of Kalapatti, was admitted with complaints of acute pain in her upper abdomen. A CT scan report revealed a ball of loosely-woven fibrous tissue inside her stomach, but it later turned out to be a bunch of hair in the shape of the stomach, according to a press release from the hospital.

The release said that doctors had tried to remove it endoscopically but in vain. It was then decided to do laparoscopy on the child.

“A surgical gasteroenterology team headed by Dr Gokul Kirubashankar performed laparoscopy on the child. The stomach of the child was cut open and a sterile plastic bag called endo bag was passed through the stomach to collect the bunch of hair without spilling it into the peritoneal cavity,” the release added.

During the counselling, it was learned that the child went into depression after a close relative passed away. As a result, she had been eating her own hair and was losing weight due to poor appetite and continuous vomiting.

Without understanding the problem that the child has been going through, her parents had assumed that the child had been losing hair due to poor nutrition.

“This is the first such case I have seen in my 32 years of experience and the disease – trichobezoar – is extremely rare,” chairman of the hospital Dr VG Mohan Prasad said.

AGRA: Continuing their indefinite strike over the issue of parking fee, Sanjay Place traders on Monday started submitting ‘negative’ feedback in the central government cleanliness survey Swachh Survekshan 2020. The survey is scheduled to conclude on January 31. This comes like a major trouble for Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) administration .

Traders stated that they rated AMC a ‘zero’ on various parameters as the situation of cleanliness has worsened in the city. Besides, a 22.65 crore scam related to door-to-door garbage collection had also surfaced earlier this month.

Swachh Survekshan Survey covers over 4,370 cities across the country and ranks are accorded to them based on cleanliness and other parameters. Citizen feedback is a key component of the survey as it carries 25% weightage in the 6,000 mark survey.

On Monday, traders’ indefinite strike completed fourteen days. Traders have been protesting against the AMC administration for charging parking fee at 38 places in the market since January 14.

President of the Sanjay Place Welfare Association KN Agnihotri said, “Over 100 traders have rated the civic body zero on various parameters of the Swachh Surveskshan Survey because condition of sanitation and hygiene in the city has worsened in the recent past. Sewage problem in Sanjay Place has not been resolved even after repeated complaints. Besides, a major scam took place in the name of door-to-door garbage collection.”

Through public announcement system and phone calls, AMC is spreading awareness about the citizen feedback for Swachh Survekshan Survey. Citizens are being requested to give a high score and a ‘positive’ feedback.

Secretary of the market association Hiren Agarwal said, “We have been protesting since past fourteen days but no AMC official has come to address our issues. We would not be able to cooperate with the civic body administration in getting a good rank in the survey. All the traders will urge their family members and customers to give a negative feedback to AMC as cleanliness in major parts of the city remains in a very poor state.”

Talking to TOI, municipal commissioner Arun Prakash said, “Giving a negative feedback in Swachh Survekshan Survey just to pressurize the AMC administration is in a very bad taste. We will try to ensure that their feedbacks are not counted. In this regard, a letter will be sent to the ministry of urban development.”

Meanwhile, over 50 traders have registered their complaint against AMC on the state government’s Integrated Grievances Redressal System (IGRS).

When Karthi replied that he seized the vehicle as it did not have required documents, Eswari said, “The vehicle is being operated with required permit and documents. They (the vehicle’s owner) have seen (bribed) from tahsildar to collector. While only RI has power to seize vehicles, how could you do it? Better release it or tashildar would come on your line.”

Karthi could be heard replying to her: “If so, I have caught the vehicle which did not have documents, and you (RI) come and seize it.” He also questioned her whether the same vehicle owner had bribed her too. Eswari replied that she would seize a vehicle only if she finds it.

VMC commissioner Nalin Updhyay said that the worker was first taken to the SSG Hospital and then a private hospital. He added that the injuries to the worker were not serious.

The solar dome project has been a jinxed affair marred with delays. It as conceptualised in 2014, but is yet to be completed.

Scaffolding fell earlier too

Vadodara: Two cars were damaged and others had a close shave when the metal scaffolding erected for work on the solar dome had collapsed in May 2017 too.

CHENNAI: A 20-year-old man from Maharashtra, who with two friends tried to save two women from drowning off Elliot’s beach in Besant Nagar on Sunday, died, police said. The deceased youth was identified as Mayur Wadaskar .

A police officer said Kaviya, 18, and Poornima, 18, Bengaluru natives who are students of VIT Vellore, came to the beach along with three other friends. While the others stood on the shore, thee two women moved to the water’s edge and suddenly went missing. Their friends believed they were playing and called out to them. A couple of minutes later, when there was no response, the three on the shore cried for help.

Mayur and his friends Ankit, 20, of Delhi and Anand, 23, of Rajasthan, heard the cry for help and jumped in. They too were dragged in. The three young men had recently joined a private firm in Ennore as trainees and were staying in Mandaveli.

A team of the patrol police and some fishermen rushed into the sea and pulled out all the five. While Kaviya and Mayur were sent to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General hospital where the youth died, the others were sent to the Royapettah Government Hospital. The Sastri Nagar police registered a case of accidental death.

Incidents of drowning at Elliot’s continue with alarming frequency despite repeated warnings, say police. “We have all-terrain (ATV) vehicles at the beach, mainly to discourage people from entering the sea,” said a police officer. The warning boards however serve no purpose, he said.

The famous beach is incidentally home to the Schmidt memorial, in remembarance of Danish sailor K A J Schmidt who died trying to save a girl there in 1930.

157,['28/01/2020'],Chennai: Kottur ‘forest’ to give 200 tonnes of O2,"This story is from January 28, 2020

CHENNAI: The urban forest that Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) is growing on a small patch of land near Kotturpuram MRTS station will consume 43.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide and give out 200 tonnes of oxygen every year after maturity, the civic body’s official statistics showed.

According to BBC Science Focus magazine, a human breathes about 9.5 tonnes of air in a year, but oxygen only makes up about 23% of that air, by mass. A person only extracts a little over a third of the oxygen from each breath. That works out to a total of about 740kg of oxygen a year. Which is, very roughly, seven or eight trees’ worth.

The forest which is coming up on 20,000sqft is being done according the Miyawaki scheme a Japanese method of growing different varieties of trees on a small patch of land using organic manure. The site was earlier a dump yard for construction debris. In all, 1,600 tonnes of debris was removed from the area to plant trees, an official said.

The corporation said 2,000 saplings of 40 varieties have been planted at the spot at a gap of 1m. Saplings include traditional varieties like poongan, peepal and neem. Fruit-bearing trees would also be part of the forest.

In the first year, the forest would consume 11.7 tonnes of carbon dioxide and give out four tonnes of oxygen.

The civic body sources said this calculation was provided by a consultant based on already established studies.

Dr S Balaji, former principal chief conservator of forests and a forestry expert, told TOI that the extent of carbon dioxide consumed is based on the number of leaves, thickness of the trunk and the weight of a tree. Plants and trees consume carbon dioxide during the day to synthesise biomass and in the process give out oxygen.

“For trees that grow faster, like bamboo, the rate of photosynthesis is higher and hence it would give out more oxygen,” he said. The Miyawaki system uses organic manure and soil for growing trees. Wet waste (converted to manure), coir, cow dung and other similar material is used as an organic manure.

Dehradun: After witnessing traffic congestion at various locations across the city on the fourth day of the ongoing special traffic plan on Monday, the police department has now decided to put the plan on hold.

This comes after peoplefaced a harrowing time on the roads for the past few days. Himanshu Kumar, a student of St Thomas, told TOI,“ I live in Premnagar and on all the days that the plan was implemented, I reached my school late by an hour. My daily schedule was completely disturbed because of the police experiment.” Saurav Singh, another student, added,“This is a wrong time for the experiment especially for the students as we are preparing for our board exams. Currently, the practicals and pre-boards are in progress and if we get late now, it becomes difficult for us to make up for the lost time.”

Many residents complained that they faced difficulties in reaching places that were just a few hundred metres from their residence. “At Rajpur Road, there was a circumtitious route plan in place to reach the petrol pump which otherwise takes just a few minutes to reach from my place. But on Monday, I had to travel a few extra kilometres to reach it in order to fill up my vehicle,” said Vishwas Pal, a resident.

Meanwhile, police officials acknowledged that there were some shortcomings in the plan which they will address after taking feedbacks and suggestions from the public.

SSP Dehradun Arun Mohan Joshi told TOI, “The experiment went off well with some positive results. At the same time, it has helped us in knowing the bottlenecks and problems in the process. Therefore, the normal traffic plan will come into existence from Tuesday and we will work on the future course of action.”

He added that once the smart city projects start, the special traffic plan will be put in place. ‘Once the project work begins, we will implement the special traffic plan after resolving all the issues. To find solutions we will constitute teams, which will interact with people from different sections of the society.”

159,['28/01/2020'],Citizenship seekers may have to prove faith,"This story is from January 28, 2020

A lawyer during a pro-CAA rally in Mumbai

NEW DELHI: The Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) rules, being given final touches, are likely to require eligible migrants to furnish documents establishing country of origin, date of arrival prior to the cutoff and religious identity while there won’t be any need for proof of religious persecution.

Migrants or refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan need to prove they belong to one of six minority faiths — Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Jain, Buddhist or Parsi. The documents recording religion of migrants applying for Indian citizenship under CAA must pertain to the period prior to December 31, 2014, a senior government functionary said.

The functionary added no documents may, however, be sought to establish that the applicant came to India on account of religious persecution back home. “The ground of religious persecution includes fear of religious persecution as well. So, no documentation may be necessary,” the functionary said.

Sources indicated that the CAA rules may not allow the state administration much role in processing applications. “State and local administration’s role will be minimal. While the application process will be entirely online, a central authority may be designated in the states to process claims,” a source said.

It was pointed out that CAA rules are likely to incorporate the suggestion made by Assam government for a short, time-bound application window for Bangladeshi migrants in the state.

Indications are that documentation requirements for citizenship applications under CAA may extensively borrow from existing long-term visa policy for migrants belonging to six minority faiths in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

Any document issued by the governments of Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan or from any government authority or agency clearly showing the religion of the applicant — like a school certificate for example — can be furnished to establish membership of minority community.

Similarly, citizenship of the applicant for long-term visa can be proved by furnishing documents such as copy of the old passport or any other document issued by government authorities or agencies in these countries such as birth certificate, educational certificate by board or university, certificate of enrolment and study in schools, government-issued license, land and tenancy records.

Documents to prove the date of entry of long-term visa applicant into India include slip issued by census enumerators in India to such persons while conducting NPR prior to December 31, 2014, insurance policies issued by companies in India, bank and/or post office account, court and tribunal records in India, government-issued licence and land and tenancy records, permanent residential certificate, document showing service or employment, gram panchayat secretary certificate and Aadhaar card (all issued in India).

BENGALURU: Byatarayanapura police launched a manhunt for those who allegedly stole Rs 48,000 cash from a cupboard inside Sri Gali Anjaneya Swamy temple on Mysuru Road recently. Police registered a case of burglary against unknown persons based on a complaint filed by BV Manjunatha, a trustee of the temple.

Manjunatha told police that the robbery took place around 11.45pm on January 15 and filed a complaint a few days later after ascertaining the stolen amount. “Going by CCTV footage, the miscreants entered the temple premises by climbing the compound wall and later took the cupboard key kept in the cash counter. They opened the cupboard and fled with the cash,” Manjunatha said.

162,['28/01/2020'],70% of higher edu institutions in state are not accredited: NAAC director,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Coimbatore: About 70% of the higher education institutions in the state have not acquired accreditation from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), said S C Sharma, the director of the council. Of the total 2,462 higher education institutions, only 781 have acquired accreditation.

Sharma, who was in the city on Monday to participate in the inauguration of Bharat Ratna Prof CNR Rao Research Centre at Avinashilingam Institute for Home Science and Higher Education for Women, told reporters that higher education institutions including engineering colleges, arts and science colleges in Tamil Nadu were lagging behind in getting the NAAC accreditation.

“While certain colleges and autonomous colleges in the state have been doing well, there is much scope for improvement,” he said.

Comparing with Maharashtra, which has been doing well in getting NAAC accreditation, the director said around 75% of higher education institutions have got NAAC accreditation in Maharashtra. “The Maharashtra government had introduced a clause linking salaries of faculty members with NAAC accreditation. So automatically all institutions come forward to get accredited. Tamil Nadu should also follow the same,” he said.

Other key areas in which higher education institutions in the state have been lagging are research, innovation and patents and filling vacant faculty posts, he said.

NAAC, an autonomous body funded by the University Grants Commission, assesses and accredits higher education institutions in the country. It grades institutions in a scale of 1 to 4. Government higher education institutions become eligible for receiving funds only if they get a good NAAC score.

Speaking of the revamped NAAC accreditation mechanism, Sharma said they had finalised the new method around three weeks. The new method was based majorly on information and communication technology and it had minimal human intervention. There were around 93 metrics which would capture the entire details of the institution.

“The institution’s self-study report comprises 70% of the accreditation process. We would also get student satisfaction survey for the institutions. The rest 30% of the accreditation process was based on the assessment. We have around 3,500 assessors to conduct the assessment across the country,” said Sharma. Once the institutions upload their documents and self-study report, the data verification and validation will be conducted. Subsequently, the system would select the institution to be visited, he said. The process would be completed within three to four months, he said.

NAAC is spreading awareness about the accreditation process to institutions, Sharma said. “Our mandate is to handhold government institutions and those from rural areas. We encourage them to get accredited,” he said.

Coimbatore: The national commission for women (NCW), New Delhi, has summoned the superintendent of police, Coimbatore, to appear before it on February 4 pertaining to a petition submitted by the wife of a AIADMK cadre. The AIADMK cadre, Rajkumar, was found dead at Kaliyappagoundenpudur near Pollachi on August 24, 2018. The Coimbatore rural police registered a case under Section 174 CrPC.

However, his wife Abhirami shot off petitions to the NCW and national human rights commission (NHRC) claiming that she suspected foul play in her husband’s death. She requested the commissions to order the police to alter the suspicious death case to murder. Last week, the national commission for women summoned SP Sujit Kumar to appear before it on February 4.

Police said already Abhirami had sent more than 100 petitions to police officials to alter the case to murder. The officials had decided to send a detailed report in connection with the case to the national commission for women. tnn

The present Sanjivani Cooperative Sugar Factory at Dharbandora is shut, putting farmers in a predicament, this crushing season.

“Extraction of sugar and ethanol is the way forward. An expression of interest is under way to see the viability and technical feasibility. We will analyse everything. It is the government’s intention to have a factory running 365 days of the year, instead of 70 days as the present one runs,” Gaude said.

Hitting out at the opposition for demanding that steps should be taken for the plant’s revival, the minister said the factory is old with machinery that is almost 50 years old.

165,['28/01/2020'],No Indian Muslim will be affected by CAA: Defence minister Rajnath Singh,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Defence minister Rajnath Singh at the pro-CAA convention in Mangaluru on Monday

MANGALU RU: Defence minister Rajnath Singh asserted that not a single Muslim in India will be thrown out of the country due to the proposed National Register of Citizens and said the Bharatiya Janata Party will throw its might behind the community if a single member feels persecuted by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. This is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s motto of Sab ka saath, sab ka Vikas aur sab ka vishwas, Rajnath added at a pro-CAA rally here on Monday.

Assailing Congress for spreading fear among Muslims regarding a law that both houses of Parliament debated and passed, Rajnath addressed the mammoth rally organised by the district unit of BJP. He said BJP has merely fulfilled a wish that Mahatma Gandh had directed the Congress to do post-Independence. This was also in the resolution adopted by the Congress Working Committee on November 25, 1947, he said.

Asking the crowd if the government discriminated based on religion in implementing its various programmes such as Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, Ayushman Bharat or in providing infrastructure works, Rajnath wondered how the same government could discriminate with CAA. “How can the opposition accuse us of being discriminatory with this step their leaders wanted?” he asked.

Reminding the Congress that it implemented the NRC based on a Supreme Court directive, he said, “NRC naam ki chidiya hum (BJP) logon ne nahin laya tha!” CAA is a balm the government is using to apply on souls of persecuted minorities from India’s theocratically ruled neighbours and is not to hurt any Indian citizen, he said, adding that Congress can’t see anything good the government does.

Noting that there is a concerted attempt on part of the Congress to drive a wedge between Hindus and Muslims using CAA, Rajnath said it wouldn’t be surprising if foreign powers are behind it. The former BJP national chief exhorted the party’s rank and file to explain to Muslims that their citizenship is not under threat and they will continue to enjoy their rights as any other citizen.

Rajnath said the opposition should not forget the ‘national dharma’. Let the opposition question the continuing persecution of minorities in neighbouring Pakistan, he said. While CAA is only to accommodate persecuted minorities from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, majority of whom are Dalits, why should anyone have any objection to it? he asked. Noting that as home minister in the Modi government’s first innings, he had given citizenship to over 600 Muslims including Pakistani singer Adnan Sami, Rajnath said Muslims from theocratic neighbours wanting to become Indian citizens are still able to do so under CAA provisions. Even with NPR that Congress introduced in 2010, no one will be forced to give their personal details such as their father’s name or date of birth, he said.

This is part of the ‘Mane Mana Bheti’ programme under Mission-100 Karkala launched by block education officer (BEO) GS Shashidhar, aimed at securing 100% results in SSLC exams.

Shashidhar said that top officers from the district including deputy commissioner G Jagadeesha, zilla panchayat CEO Preeti Gehlot, superintendent of police N Vishnuvardhan, taluk panchayat executive officer Dr Major Harsha, MLA V Sunil Kumar, former MLC Ganesh Karnik, DDPI Sheshashayana Karinja, doctors and industrialists visited nearly 10 houses each on a single day. The idea of 100 VIPS visiting homes of SSLC students was mooted my MLA Sunil Kumar, he said.

Udupi SP N Vishnuvardhan who visited nine houses in Bailoor said, “This exercise should help in boosting the morale and confidence of the students and help them perform better. I casually asked students about their future dreams. Many were keen on answering civil service exams and becoming top officers,” he said, adding that he is looking forward to visiting more homes.

Every day, education department officers are visiting at least 10-15 houses between 5am-7am and 7pm-9pm to ensure that students wake up in the morning and study well. Students also discuss with officers the problems they face in school or the subjects they have difficulty in learning. It is a surprise visit and students are not informed in advance about the officer’s visit.

This year, 2,567 students from Karkala will be appearing for SSLC exams.

Madras high court

CHENNAI: The Madras high court has warned higher officials of the state home department saying it would be constrained to summon them to court if they fail to file a comprehensive report on the number of FIRs/CSR registered/issued and action taken in connection with unauthorised banners.

A division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and Justice R Hamelatha made the observation on Monday, while hearing a batch of pleas, including petitions moved by social activist Traffic Ramaswamy seeking action against authorities who failed to check erection of illegal banners endangering public safety and inconveniencing road-users.

When the pleas came up for hearing on Monday, the judges pointed out that the authorities had so far not filed any such report despite orders passed by the court, and said that it would be constrained to summon senior officers of the home department if the report is not made available by February 27.

To this, government pleader Jayaprakash Narayanan submitted that after the death of techie Subhasree, who was run over by a truck after an illegal banner placed by an AIADMK functionary fell on her in September last, such offences have come down drastically in view of strict enforcement by the authorities.

Recording the submissions, the bench wondered why the officials are failing to file a report. This apart, the bench also heard another plea moved by Ramaswamy seeking to restrain the state from issuing government sponsored advertisements with pictures of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa , as she was ‘convicted’ by the Supreme Court in the disproportionate assets case.

“This court takes note of the fact that the conviction of the former chief minister has been set aside by the Karnataka high court and in the further appeal, the Supreme Court rendered the verdict after her demise,” the court said. The judges then directed the Tamil Nadu government to file an affidavit as to its policy on release of advertisements with pictures of former chief minister after taking note of Supreme Court judgment in the Manzoor Alikhan case. The court also directed the registry to delink the plea from the batch and post it on February 27, separately.

Vijayawada: In view of the upcoming panchayat elections, the high court on Monday directed the state election commission to file an affidavit with regard to painting of government offices in party colours. The high court directed the election commission to take action as per the norms specified by law.

One Muppa Venkateswara Rao from Guntur district had moved the high court against the inaction of government officials after the panchayat building of Pallapadu was painted in the colours of YSRC flag. He argued in his petition that if the government offices were to be painted in party colours it could affect the voting pattern.

Earlier, the high court had directed the state government not to paint any government building in the colours of political parties.

On Monday, the petitioner’s advocate argued that as the state government is preparing to conduct elections to local bodies, the government offices, painted in party colours, must be repainted. Taking the arguments of the petitioner into consideration, the high court bench headed by the chief justice J K Maheswari and Justcie Nainala Jayasurya directed the state election commission to take action according to the law and asked to it file an affidavit over the issue and posted the matter for further hearing on February 5.

The chief spokesperson of BJP, AP, Srinivasa Sudhish Rambotla and Guntupalli Srinivas from Eluru had moved the HC challenging the state government’s decision.

The petitioners argued that government order 85 is in violation of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009. Rambotla argued that the state government cannot make any law in contravention with the central law. Moreover, the right to select the medium of instruction should be with the children and they should not be forced to take English medium, he stated.

While the state government sought more time to file the counter , the petitioners’ advocate claimed that the government is going ahead with the implementation of GO 85 and public money is being spent to print textbooks.

Responding to the petitioners argument, the high court said that they would recover the costs from the officials concerned if the need arises and posted the matter for further hearing on February 4.

172,['28/01/2020'],Loan fraud case: More trouble for Transstroy,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Rayapati Sambasiva Rao

HYDERABAD: Former MP Rayapati Sambasiva Rao-owned Transstroy India Ltd could land itself in further trouble with the Enforcement Directorate ( ED ) deciding to issue an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002.

Highly-placed sources said ECIR would be issued based on a CBI FIR against Transstroy in a loan fraud case.

ED has already registered a Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) case against Transstroy for irregularities in foreign exchange transactions. ED is probing allegations that the company has transferred funds to Singapore and Russia violating the FEMA rules. ED is also probing into the affairs of a joint venture company, Polavaram Project Transstory and JSC EC UES. The latter is a Russian company.

CBI, in its FIR, named Transstroy, promoter-chairman Sambasiva Rao, MD Cherukuri Sridhar and another director Suryadevara Srinivasa Babji.

CBI found that the accused had inflated stocks and balance sheets of the company in its probe. The accused were believed to have diverted funds of consortium banks to the tune of Rs 3,822 crore. CBI is also probing into allegations of Rs 794 crore written off in the name of adjustments towards reserves and surplus.

The probe also revealed that financial documents were manipulated. The difference amount of manipulation was to the tune of Rs 2,298 crore.

In the FEMA case, it was found that Rs 15.34 crore was transferred to Transstroy Singapore PET Ltd, a subsidiary of Transstroy India, in 2013-14 from Bank of Baroda without the permission of the lenders.

It may be recalled CBI sleuths had conducted searches on the premises of the accused earlier.

Lieutenant government Kiran Bedi

PUDUCHERRY: Lieutenant government Kiran Bedi on Monday said chief minister V Narayanasamy and his cabinet colleagues must express their regret to the two Padma awardees from Puducherry and artists from Jammu and Kashmir and Arunachal Pradesh deputed by the Union government to perform at the 'At Home' reception hosted by the Raj Nivas on the Republic Day for disrespecting the sanctity of a national event on Sunday.

Bedi said Narayanasamy and others must also express their regret to the office of the lieutenant governor. Narayanasamy and others left the reception midway after a Raj Nivas staff member requested him to honour the Padma awardees, who were invited by Raj Nivas to attend the reception.

Narayanasamy was quick to decline the invite pointing out that he was not formally informed about the programme (honouring Padma awardees) and left Raj Nivas within a few minutes. His cabinet colleagues followed suit.

""The ‘At Home’ Invites by Raj Nivas this time was more diverse, inclusive and spontaneous. It was also decided to invite more award winners up to the last day, who were recipients of meritorious awards at the Republic Day parade. This included the Padma Awardees too on whom the announcement came on the late evening before. We invited both the Awardees so that Puducherrians get an immediate opportunity to greet these national heroes. Both the Padma Awardees were gracious to attend even at such short notice. Once present in the audience our Comptroller Raj Nivas Mrs Asha Gupta considered it respectful to recognize the presence of the Padma Awardees by requesting the HCM (honourable chief minister) to present a shawl to them. She thought it would be befitting the occasion that the HCM does the honours. The HCM instead of welcoming this offer shouted back and argued back, saying 'how can it be done without his prior intimation and prior approval?' There was a great deal of embarrassment. This was right in the presence of select invitees and all the senior officers of the administration,"" Bedi said in a WhatsApp post.

She pointed out that the ‘At Home’ is not a private event. ""It’s an event of national sanctity. It’s also an annual gathering of respected people from all walks of life, specially invited, to celebrate the most important national event the year. This time as was suggested in the Governors' Conference by the Hon'ble President of India to make the ‘At Home’ more diverse and inclusive with an element of celebrations and recognition. We are grateful to the GOI Ministry of Art and Culture who sent their artists all the way to perform here and regret the behaviour of our elected representatives towards ignoring them. And disrespecting our Padma Awardees by refusing to appreciate their presence. They ought to express their regret to two Padma Awardees, the J&K and Arunachal Pradesh artists sent by Govt of India also. Besides to the office of Lt Gov for disrespecting the sanctity of a national event,"" she said. Bedi said people in top positions are role models to youth and others. ""They influence the next generation and impact others. I hope such a happening does not reoccur in the next At Home held at the Raj Nivas,"" she said.

175,['28/01/2020'],Cops brace to tackle traffic woes in prep for capital rush,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Visakhapatnam: As the city gears up to become executive capital of the state, city police are preparing to take on the challenge that will be posed by an expansion in traffic infrastructure.

The executive capital will require a far more extensive urban transport system and than what is in place now and the primary considerations for city traffic police will be managing traffic. The number of vehicles in the city has grown exponentially, at over 13 lakh in 2019, up from 5.5 lakh in 2012.

Two-wheelers continue to dominate city roads, accounting for over 80 per cent of total vehicular population, followed by cars at 10 per cent. Once the executive capital shifts to Vizag, at least 25,000 vehicles, including over 10,000 SUVs, will be added to the city’s roads.

City police commissioner Rajiv Kumar Meena said that private vehicles dominate in the city in the absence of an efficient public transport system. Vehicular movement is bound to increase and traffic management will be the biggest challenge for the police, the commissioner added.

Little scope exists, however, to widen roads within city limits. Issues such as road engineering works, construction of parking lots by local bodies, widening key roads and expanding junctions remain to be addressed.

“There is an urgent need to complete the widening of the Anandapuram-Anakapalle highway via Sabbavaram and also widen the Anakapalle-Tagarapuvalasa road road to mitigate traffic chaos in the city,” said ACP (traffic) MRK Raju.

Poor last-mile connectivity continues to be a problem, said K Lokanadham, district secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), and more buses and local trains can help the city handle the shift to executive capital status. In the absence of local trains and a limited fleet of buses, private vehicles have been choking city roads, he added.

A software professional in the city said the government should instead address key issues in Vizag, such as traffic and security, before relocating the capital from Amaravati. The GVMC should also focus on completing the BRTS project, he added.

Another professional added that the government should consider introducing CNG-run city bus services to mitigate pollution and focus on road infrastructure and the public transport system.

Besides constructing flyovers and setting up traffic signal points and foot-overbridges (FOB), manpower in the traffic wing needs to be increased by adding at least another 400 cops to the existing 500.

176,['28/01/2020'],Delhi move to affect politics outside Pb?,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Jalandhar: Shiromani Akali Dal’s decision not to contest Delhi assembly elections, and its top brass remaining indecisive in taking a clear line and letting its Delhi unit decide on the issue, could have a far-reaching effect — end of the predominance of Punjab-based Akali leaders in deciding the political direction of Sikhs in other states and letting them take their own political decisions.

SAD’s Delhi unit has not yet decided what position it would take for the February 8 assembly polls. For decades, Akali Dal would have a say in the political affairs of Sikhs in states neighbouring Punjab, especially in Haryana and Delhi. At the same time, it would speak up on issues concerning Sikhs in distant states as well.

However, recent political developments, first in Haryana and now in Delhi, could be a turning point for the Punjab-based SAD’s politics in other states. In the past, Sikh leaders in Delhi, through their factions of Akali Dal, had been taking their own political lines also. However, Akali leadership of Punjab would have a say in their affairs. In Haryana also, it would play a significant role in leveraging Sikh voters.

Earlier, SAD had an alliance with the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) as its party patron and former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal enjoyed close friendship with the Chautala family. This time, SAD faced an embarrassing situation after BJP refused to have an alliance with it for Haryana polls, despite its repeated expressions of interest.

Till around 40 years ago, Jag Asra Guru Ott (JAGO) party leader Manjit Singh GK’s father, late Jathedar Santokh Singh, would take his own path in Delhi, while maintaining a love-hate relationship with Punjab-based top leaders of Akali Dal. Nearly two decades ago, it was Paramjit Singh Sarna who charted his own path and minimised the influence of Badal and his family in the Sikh affairs of Delhi by taking away control of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC).

However, Punjab-based Akali leadership still played a significant part in deciding political course of the Sikhs in Delhi. “Akali Dal should confine its politics to Punjab only as it has been calling itself a Punjabi party and should leave Sikhs of other states to decide their own political course. They know local factors and politics better. They are wise enough to take their own decisions,” said former Rajya Sabha MP Tarlochan Singh, who remains one of Delhi-based key articulators of Sikh issues.

Sikh author Gurbachan Singh said the development in Delhi reflected the diminishing influence of the Badal-led Akali Dal in the political affairs of Sikhs in neighbouring states. “In a few years, Sikhs of these states would play politics that is independent of Akali Dal in Punjab,” he said.

Vijayawada: The high court on Monday directed joint collectors in all districts to consider representations from petitioners in a PIL challenging the collection of parking fee at shopping malls and theatres and to take necessary action if they found the practice illegal.

N N Grace, general secretary, Mundadugu Praja Party, moved the high court seeking directions to the government and officials concerned to prevent movie theatres and shopping malls from collecting parking fee. On behalf of the petitioner, J Sravan Kumar argued that collection of parking fee was in violation of Section 31 of the AP Apartments Promotion of Constructions and Ownership Act 1987 and as well as violation of the high court orders.

He argued that joint collectors in districts were not taking any action despite giving representations to them.

Disposing the petition, the bench headed by chief justice of the high court Justice J K Maheswari and Justice Nainala Jayasurya directed the joint collectors to take action against the movie theatres and shopping malls if they found the collection of parking fee illegal.

COIMBATORE: With the city airport doing away the time limit for cars which come to drop or pick up passengers on the main road in front of the airport entrance, several drivers are seen parking their cars on the road and wait for customers. Some parked cars hinder vehicular movements as they wait upto 10min blocking the entry and exit gates completely. Passengers, who are in a hurry, lose valuable time because of this.

Several cars lined up close to the kerb to pick up passengers on Monday at 10am when a Spicejet flight from Chennai and an Indigo flight from another destination landed. The cars which came later started occupying next two lanes to wait for passengers, leaving several cars that came to drop off and pick up passengers stranded away from the airport.

“I took the 10am flight as I could reach my office by 10.15am. But I am stuck in my car and it is already 10.15am,” said Kumar K, a businessman, who had to sit inside his car and wait for two cars in front of him to clear the path.

Earlier, cars could pick up and drop off passengers at the airport without paying any charge as long as they exited within five minutes. Cars that take more than five minutes had to pay Rs 50.

Airport director N Mahalingam said the rule was withdrawn two months ago as people who had to pay take time to search for change, delaying other passengers also. “So, we decided to charge people who want to park their vehicles in the parking area,” he said.

The director admitted that some cars were taking advantage of this decision and parking on the driveway for free. “We have now employed two service men to clear such jams and ensure they don’t happen again,” said Mahalingam.

CM V Narayanasami

PUDUCHERRY: Chief minister V Narayanasamy on Monday accused lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi of flouting the conventions at the 'At Home' reception hosted by Raj Nivas .

Speaking to reporters, he claimed that he was not aware of the Raj Nivas’ decision to honour Padma awardees (until he was invited during the reception to honour them).

He said the government was happy that two people from Puducherry were conferred with Padma awards. He said the lieutenant governor could have honoured the awardees in an exclusive function at her office instead of choosing the At Home reception that too without any prior intimation to him and others.

“It is the Republic Day celebrations and all of a sudden an announcement was made (inviting him to honour Padma awardees). I did not get any formal intimation on honouring them during the celebration. I stood up and questioned them how they can make an announcement without any formal intimation. It is against the conventions, rules and laws,” Narayanasamy said.

He also accused Bedi of running a parallel government bypassing the government elected by the people in a democratic manner. He said Bedi on receiving any complaints from any quarters must forward them to the secretaries concerned and the secretaries must probe into the complaints and consult the ministers concerned before submitting a report to the lieutenant governor.

“But the lieutenant governor has been violating all rules, regulations, laws and high court’s order. She forwards the complaints directly to the heads of the departments and orders them to probe into the complaints and submit a report to her. The Madras high court has categorically declared that the lieutenant governor has no independent powers and authority and the lieutenant governor must act as per the aid and advice of the council of ministers. She has appealed against the order and the high court has reserved its order after arguments. The order must be pronounced anytime. She continues to flout the order. It shows that she has no knowledge of administration,” said Narayanasamy.

He said Madras high court declared that minister-in-charge along with the council of ministers headed by the chief minister are empowered to run the government and the secretaries including the chief secretary are bound to follow the same. He said the high court also declared that secretaries are not empowered to issue orders on their own or upon the instructions of the administrator.

Rebuking her charges that elected members are bullying officials, he said it was the lieutenant governor who has been threatening and intimidating officials to follow her orders else she will make adverse remarks on their confidential reports or direct the CBI to initiate inquiries against them.

Visakhapatnam: The national leadership of the BJP is likely to take a final call on the party’s state president in a week or two.

While incumbent president Kanna Lakshminaryana is keen to complete his three-year term and has already conveyed his desire to senior leaders of the party, there are speculations that there could be a change in state leadership, considering that the power centre is likely to shift to north Andhra Pradesh soon after Visakhapatnam becomes the executive capital of the state.

Among those vying for the post is BJP MLC P V N Madhav, whose family has been associated with the saffron party for more than five decades.

Others in the race include former Union minister D Purandeswari and P Manikyala Rao, who was the state endowments minister from 2014 to 2018 before the TDP decided break its alliance with BJP in the state.

Lakshminaryana who was appointed state president of BJP in 2018, was previously with the Congress. He lost the 2019 parliamentary elections from Narasaraopet.

His becoming the party’s state president soon after switching over from the Congress came as a surprise, because the saffron party normally prefers long-time party loyalists for such posts.

Madhav, the party’s MLC from Uttarandhra Graduate constituency, could be the frontrunner for the post if the central leadership decides to replaceLakshminaryana.

Another BJP MLC, Somu Veerraju, may get the nod if the party decides to field someone from the Kapu community.

“If the BJP leadership prefers to have someone young, then Madhav is likely to get the job as age is on his side. His family has remained loyal to the party since the Jan Sangh days. His father PV Chalapati Rao was a member of the Jan Sangh, while Madhav has been with the party through its ups and downs for close to two decades now,” a BJP source said.

The protesters, however, were camping on the footpath in front of Musafirkhana Park till Monday evening.

NEW DELHI: An attempt to start a Shaheen Bagh-like sit-in protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act was foiled on Lodhi Road late on Sunday when police forcefully evicted protesters gathering on a stretch near Nizamuddin Basti and cordoned off the area through the night.

The protesters, however, were camping on the footpath in front of Musafirkhana Park till Monday evening. Efforts are being made to shift them into the park to avoid congestion during peak hours. The cops are also not allowing any more people to enter the protest site.

The stretch connects Mathura Road to the Barapullah flyover, which has been handling an increased volume of traffic due to the Kalindi Kunj road closure since the beginning of the protests at Shaheen Bagh . Any chaos on this stretch will choke the whole artery connecting central Delhi to south-east Delhi, a police officer said. “With the Kalindi Kunj stretch already blocked, a choke point near Nizamuddin will add to the commuters’ woes during the peak hours,” he added.

Around 9pm on Sunday, locals started gathering at the traffic island under the Lodhi Road flyover, and a group of women even set up plastic tents. As the cops, who were already expecting a gathering, tried to convince them to move to the nearby park, the protesters got agitated. With messages about the “possible police brutalities” getting circulated on WhatsApp, more people turned up and the cops finally forced some of them to shift to the park and cordoned off the area.

A video of the incident also went viral on social media. It showed some protesters trying to confront police when they were being shifted from the site.

The altercation went on till late in the night after which the protesters agreed to restrict the sit-in to the footpath with 50-60 people. However, a crowd from the locality soon reached the spot, swelling the numbers. “We’ve managed to contain the protesters, and are trying to shift them to the park. We’ve assured them that adequate security will be given,” said a cop.

As a precautionary measure, the cops are scanning vehicles carrying groups of people going towards Nizamuddin. The traffic, too, is being diverted through the Lodhi flyover or Mathura Road to avoid congestion. A large number of personnel has also been deployed to avoid any untoward incident near a temple behind Nizamuddin Basti.

Meanwhile, the special investigation team has been asked to probe the background of a group of women who has allegedly been spotted at different protests as DU, Jamia or JNU students. The probe has been ordered after a woman leading a group has allegedly been captured on a video misbehaving with police.

VADODARA: A junior clerk of Vadodara Municipal Corporation’s (VMC) revenue department was arrested by the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) on Monday for accepting a bribe of Rs 4,000 from an owner of a plot.

The accused Gopal Rana, had demanded the bribe to hand over tax bill to the plot owner. ACB officials said that the plot owner wanted to start paying civic tax for his open plot for which he had given an application. In response to the application, Rana handed over the tax bill to the complainant, but demanded that he be paid Rs 4,000 for the work he did.

The complainant contacted ACB as he did not want to pay bribe. ACB sleuths laid a trap and as per the plan, the complainant asked Rana to meet him near Makarpura GIDC so that he can hand over the cash. As Rana accepted the cash, ACB officials nabbed him.

Chandigarh: BJP Punjab president Ashwani Sharma on Monday asked all district and block presidents of the party to reach out to people to raise awareness about Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

This was Sharma’s first meeting with the party’s 33 district presidents and 380 block presidents after he took charge of the party’s state unit on January 17. He urged the block and district chiefs to strengthen the organisation collectively and start preparing for the 2022 state elections. The meeting lasted three hours.

Sharma went on to claim that opposition parties were misleading people on CAA. “Muslims are in majority in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Therefore, they cannot be persecuted in these countries. We need to provide protection to people of other religions,” he added.

Edapaddi K Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam talked tough, asking ministers to buck up for the elections ahead

CHENNAI: In a bid to put their house in order, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and his deputy O Panneerselvam on Monday held meetings for three hours with members of the cabinet at the state secretariat. They addressed groups of ministers besides having one-on-one interactions at the secretariat. The leaders are said to be upset over the lack of coordination, internal feuding and open bickering impacting the AIADMK’s prospects in the recently held rural local body elections, and ahead of the crucial urban civic polls .

Pointing to the not very laudable rural local body election results, Palaniswami and Panneerselvam talked tough, asking ministers to buck up for the elections ahead. A majority of them are district secretaries. With the party performing badly on their turf, they were issued a stern warning, sources privy to the meeting told TOI.

Incidentally, EPS had a separate one-on-one meeting with Panneerselvam for an hour, before his interactions with the ministers. The meetings that began around 5pm went on for close to three hours in the chief minister’s chamber in the presence of CM’s confidantes and ministers, P Thagamani and S P Velumani. “The meeting was called to discuss the local body poll results in view of the upcoming urban local body elections and 2021 assembly polls,” said a minister, seeking anonymity. “The leadership summoned ministers who were in Chennai. Ministers in charge of districts that lost to the DMK narrowly were asked to do better,” said the minister.

The ruling party won 209 district panchayat ward seats as against the DMK’s 244, and 1,779 panchayat union ward seats as against the DMK’s 2,090. While violence and cross-voting marred the indirect elections across the state, the AIADMK bagged 14 district panchayat president posts, leaving 12 to the DMK and one to its ally, the PMK. Infighting in the district units, allegations against local ministers not taking along the party MLAs dented the AIADMK’s prospects in several districts. Recently, former minister and Perundurai MLA Thoppu N D Venkatachalam accused environment minister K C Karupannan of fielding independents in Perundurai panchayat union. Venkatachalam told TOI that Karupannan showed disrespect to old-timers.

The stock-taking comes ahead of the urban local body polls, which may be scheduled in March or April, after delimitation of the newly constituted nine districts. “The two leaders told the ministers how to work for the elections and how to coordinate with the elected MLAs in the districts for better results. The ministers were asked to show results,” said a source. A few senior party leaders recalled former chief minister J Jayalalithaa holding a similar closed-door session in June 2012, with the elected councillors of the Chennai Corporation in a corporation-owned hall in the city. In the wake of complaints of inefficiency, she had threatened to dissolve the elected council and run the corporation with the help of special officers if they did not mend their ways, they said.

Panaji: After the Church-backed anti-CAA protest held in South Goa last week, Vishwa Hindu Parishad’s ( VHP ) general secretary Milind Parande said that despite central government ’s assurance, if anyone is inciting persons of his community against the CAA , then that person is not fit to lead the community.

Parande also called the country-wide demonstrations against CAA ‘managed’ and said that those protesting the act have been incited for selfish political gains ‘by some political parties’.

“In Goa also, I am aware that people are making statements that citizenship of persons here will be affected.When nobody’s citizenship is being taken away, what are they talking about? Any Indian citizen need not worry about their citizenship. The government has already given this assurance. And despite this assurance, if someone is trying to incite people, then the person is not leading his community in the right direction. People should think about such wrong leadership,” Parande said in Panaji on Monday.

He added that those involved in violence in the name of demonstrating against CAA should be prosecuted.

Visakhapatnam: The death of a 17-year-old girl under suspicious circumstances led to protests by the family, relatives and locals at Palasa in Srikakulam district on Monday. The agitators demanded the police initiate action against those responsible for the death of the girl.

It may be recalled that the 17-year-old girl was a first-year Intermediate student at a private college. She was found lifeless near a railway track at Dharmapuram village under Palasa Government Railway Police (GRP) station limits in the district in the early hours of Sunday.

The girl’s parents have alleged that their daughter was kidnapped, raped and then murdered by one of her friends. They also alleged that the boy, who is also a student at the same private college, had been stalking her on the pretext of being in love with her, and then killed her.

Based on the complaint from the victim’s parents, GRP personnel at Palasa registered a case under kidnap and murder and shifted the body to a government hospital for an autopsy.

Palasa GRP sub-inspector said the case would be transferred to Srikakulam police for further investigation as the case is suspected to be one of kidnap, rape and murder. Further investigation is necessary to ascertain the reasons behind the death, the sub-inspector said.

Multiple injuries were found on the victim’s body. Police are awaiting the post-mortem report.

196,['28/01/2020'],Bangladesh issues release order for eight north AP fishermen,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The Bangladesh government on Monday issued the release order for eight fisherman from north Andhra who have been in a Bangladeshi jail since October 2, 2019. The Indian high commission in Dhaka has confirmed the development.

The Bangladesh Coast Guard had detained these eight fishermen — who were sailing on a boat ‘Amrutha’ — for straying into the neighbouring country’s waters in October last year.

The fishermen had been handed over to Mongla police in Bagerhat district in Bangladesh and a case was registered under the Marine Fisheries Ordinance, 1983. Bagerhat senior judicial magistrate court had sent the fishermen to jail custody.

Confirming the developments, an official from the high commission’s office told TOI, “We have been pursuing this release order for the past few months and finally managed to convince them.”

On November 28, TOI reported that Bangladesh might release the eight fishermen soon after the police report claimed that no fishing nets or catch were seized from the boat and the vessel had entered the Bangladeshi territory owing to inclement weather.

“Now that the release order has been issued, the process of sending them back will be initiated. Soon, the fishermen will be handed over to the Indian Border Security Force,” Milon Banerjee, the fishermen’s lawyer, told TOI.

All eight fishermen are from Thippalavalasa village in Vizianagaram district, but have been living in Visakhapatnam.

Earlier, Visakhapatnam MP MVV Satyanarayana had requested the Union minister for external affairs S Jaishankar to intervene in the matter to ensure the fishermen return home soon.

In October 2019, 38 Indian fishermen were detained in Bangladesh, of which 30 fishermen were from West Bengal. The high commission had confirmed that the Bangladesh government had issued a release order for all the Indian fishermen.

On January 6 this year, the Pakistan government released 22 fishermen from Srikakulam district who had been lodged in a Karachi jail since November 2018.

Tirupati: The administrative building of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams is set to get a facelift. The TTD trust board has consented to spend Rs 14.5 crore for the renovation work.

Built in 1979, the 41-year-old building houses all the departments of the TTD, which manages the affairs of the Lord Venkateswara temple and over four dozen other temples across the country. Besides, it also houses the treasury and the Parakamani counting halls. The quadrangular building, with an open space at its heart, has three floors with a plinth area of 5,613 sq metres in each floor.

The renovations were warranted because, besides being in a severe need of repair, with the TTD administration migrating to the e-office system, a need has arisen to provide state-of-the-art workstations for its employees.

Taking all these factors into account, the TTD management, which first carried out a sample refurbishment work at one of its offices and followed it up by renovating the third floor of the administrative building, has now decided to refurbish the remaining two floors. As part of the approved works, TTD would be shelling out Rs 9.2 crore to complete various civil work, which includes new vitrified flooring, installing UPVC windows and renovation of toilets. Another Rs 4.3 crore will be spent for all electrical work, which includes purchase of split ACs, LED lights and wiring and Rs 1 crore will be spent to provide new work stations and modular furniture.

VADODARA: A mother of six girls was arrested on Monday for killing one of her daughters who was born just two months back.

The accused Kalpana Parmar, who lives in Koyali village near the city, allegedly threw her infant daughter in a pond near her home on Sunday and then lodged a complaint of kidnapping at Jawaharnagar police station.

Kalpana, 35, and her husband Ramesh were blessed with a baby girl in November. But as the couple already had five daughters, Kalpana was not happy with the sixth girl child. During investigation police learnt that there was no harassment from her husband or anyone else, but she was personally not happy. In fact, her husband who is a casual labourer, was not even aware that Kalpana had killed their daughter.

On Sunday evening, Kalpana told Ramesh that the infant is missing from the bedroom where she had left her. The couple searched for her but when she was not found, Kalpana herself became the complainant. “During her statement we felt that she was hiding something as her facts were contradictory, so we questioned her alone during which she broke down and admitted to the crime,” said in-charge inspector B H Shingrakhiya of Jawaharnagar police station.

On Monday morning, firemen and police staff found the infant’s body from the pond. Police said that they removed the section of abduction from the FIR, added the murder section and arrested Kalpana.

Uttarakhand won the toss and opted to bat first on an overcast morning. Uttarakhand batsmen continued with their poor outing as they were bundled out for 109 runs in their first innings. Uttarakhand had a poor start as both the openers went back to the pavilion without opening their account and by the time first 15 deliveries of the match were bowled Uttarakhand had lost their three wickets to Haryana’s pacers. The team’s innings never recovered and they got bowled out within 42 overs. Six batsmen got out for a single-digit score.

Uttarakhand’s new ball pair of Agrim Tiwari and Pradeep Chamoli, however, provided a dream start to their team as they dismissed four Haryana batsmen for a score of nine runs.

A high-voltage drama ensued at the party’s state headquarters on Monday as Dharchula MLA Harish Dhami turned up to offer his resignation from the post of state secretary, which was recently given to him.

Dhami said that the post given to him was to “humiliate” him as his name was kept on the last slot in the list of 98 secretaries. Besides, he also accused leader of opposition Indira Hridayesh for not being named as a special invitee in the state committee. In the absence of Pritam SIngh at party office, Dhami gave his resignation to Dhasmana, who asked him to submit the document to the state chief. When asked over the issue, Pritam Singh said, “The change was made by the higher authorities and the state unit had no role. Dhami’s name is on 16th position in the list of special invitees. I will talk to the national leadership over the issue.”

Hridayesh said, “The list was forwarded to national headquarters and after consulting it with senior national members, our chief Sonia Gandhi gave a green signal to the list.”

Train services to and from Dehradun railway station were halted on November 10 last year, and officials had promised that the renovation would be completed by February 7.

Also, the length of all platforms between (PF-01) 390 metre and (PF-02) 630 metre have been increased so that an 18-coach train can easily halt at the station. Staircases and other passenger facilities have also been upgraded at the station.

CM Edappadi K Palaniswami

CHENNAI: Arappor Iyakkam, a non-governmental organisation which filed a complaint demanding CBI probe into an alleged scam worth Rs 1,500 crore in the public distribution system recently, has launched a campaign demanding that chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami remove food minister R Kamaraj and suspend the officials involved in the scam.

The NGO has also sought ban on Christy Friedgram Industry Limited and related firms from participating in government tenders. “We have launched a campaign with our members sending tur dal, sugar and ‘zero-rupee notes’ to the chief minister in registered post to put pressure on him to act. We the citizens want the government to work for the people and ensure a transparent tender process,” said Arappor Iyakkam convenor Jayaram Venkatesan. The members of the anti-corruption movement are planning to meet the chief minister, chief secretary and finance secretary demanding action against the corrupt officials and political executives.

Responding to the allegations, Christy Friedgram Industry Limited managing director T S Kumarasamy told TOI that the firm has not violated any law. “They (government departments) float tenders and we participate in it. We get business as ours is the lowest tender. They (NGO) are at liberty to file a complaint. There is no substance in it (allegations). They (Arappor Iyakkam) could have done it with an ulterior motive. They could be instigated by the competitors,” he said. Kumarasamy, a major supplier of eggs in noon meal scheme, is already facing I-T probe for tax evasion.

Arappor Iyakkam had alleged that select firms related to Christy Friedgram and public-sector enterprises like State Trading Corporation, in collusion with Christy Friedgram, had quoted abnormally high rates ranging from Rs 10-30 per kg more than the prevailing market price for supplying various commodities like tur dal and sugar to the government.

An RTI reply confirmed that STC, the chosen bidder, had placed orders on Christy Friedgram for supply of palm oil at Rs 85.50 per litre in 2018. The market price of palm oil at that time was Rs 75.57 a litre and STC had taken tender at Rs 86.10 per litre.

Kumarasamy denied that tenders were tweaked by the government department to favour his firms. Food minister R Kamaraj told TOI that there was no truth in the allegations levelled by Arappor Iyakkam.

205,['28/01/2020'],Rera gets plaints against 100 builders,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala real estate regulatory authority ( K-Rera ) will hold its first hearing on complaints against real estate projects on February 5. More than 100 complaints have been received by the authority from buyers of projects which have not received occupancy certificate.

While a good number of complaints pertain to delay in delivery, there are also complaints against builders for failing to deliver promised features regarding a project. Multiple complaints have been received against a single project itself and in other cases individual complaints have been received.

K-Rera has scheduled hearings in February for both the complainant and the respondent. Officials with K-Rera said complaints have been received against projects dating back to 2010, 2014 time-periods.

While the number of complaints against real estate builders and promoters have crossed 100, so far only 3 Rera registrations have been made under new projects. Although around 35 applications for new projects were received by the authority for registration, the process could not be completed due to erroneous filing of application or furnishing of inaccurate information. With the frequent recurrence of inaccuracies and irregularities, K-Rera has warned promoters that it will invoke Section 60 of Real Estate ( regulation and development) Act, 2016 which stipulates that any false information given or any contravention of provision of relevant sections by the promoter will attract a penalty which may extend up to 5% of the estimated cost of the real estate project.

The notice issued by K-Rera pointed out that in spite of several directions issued by the authority, many of the applications are not being filled in the prescribed manner and that it contains so much inaccuracies and irregularities. It was also found that some of the information sought in the application form were found omitted completely and some were found false and even altered from the mandated format.

In order to deal with growing number of flawed applications, K-Rera recently issued separate checklists for promoters of ongoing and new real estate projects. The promoters were directed to file duly filled checklist for filing application along with the application for registration.

The checklist includes a set of 27 requisite details like estimate of expenditure, nature of encumbrance, land records, plan of development works, audited balance sheet, description of land and the like. K-Rera chairman P H Kurien said the authority wants to make it very clear to the public that they shall not make bookings or purchase a real estate project which has not received registration from Rera.

Kochi: Dispute between Kerala Flim Producers Association and actor Shane Nigam has worsened further with the latter reportedly demanding Rs 1 crore as compensation for settling the issue. However, Association of Malayalam Movie Artistes ( AMMA ) has opposed the demand by the producers citing it was against the reconciliation talks.

According to leaders of AMMA, the dispute has been settled through reconciliation talks with the producers. “It was after settling the issue that Shane Nigam dubbed for films which were pending following the row. The producers demand seeking Rs 1 crore compensation is unfair and so we can’t agree to it,” said Idavela Babu, general secretary, AMMA. The leadership of AMMA held a meeting in Kochi on Monday and decided to turn down the demand by producers. AMMA leadership also decided to take further steps according to the response from producers.

The dispute erupted after Shane Nigam allegedly misbehaved with producers, who later decided to impose a ban on him. They had also decided to scrap three of his films.

Later, AMMA intervened and settled the issues through reconciliation talks.

Sharjeel Imam (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Even as police of different states have launched a manhunt for JNU student Sharjeel Imam , the varsity administration has directed him to report before the proctorial committee before February 3. The inquiry against him is based on alleged “provocative speeches” made by him at Aligarh Muslim University .

Meanwhile, student groups of JNU and Jamia Millia on Monday came out in support of Imam, demanding revocation of all cases against him.

JNU registrar Pramod Kumar in a statement said, “A security report dated January 27 against Sharjeel Imam, a PhD student at Centre for Historical Studies, School of Social Sciences, has been received in the chief proctor’s office from the office of the chief security officer. The report cites media reports that on January 16, Imam made provocative speeches at AMU threatening the unity, integrity and sovereignty of the country upheld by the Constitution.”

However, the notice doesn’t mention under which section of the university ordinance has the student been summoned as the incident took place outside the JNU campus.

Jamia students held a march outside the central canteen on Monday and alleged that Imam was targeted for his identity. They objected to the sedition case against him.

Arshad, a management student, said, “The video being circulated has been misconstrued by many. He didn’t say that we should divide Northeast from India, but that there should be a Shaheen Bagh-like road blockade. Imam has always advocated chakka jam as a means to put pressure on the government. He only wanted a chakka jam, something that several political outfits have indulged in the past.”

At JNU, two councillors, Afreen Fatima and Farhat Salim, and organisations like Assam Study Circle, Bahujan Sahitya Sangh, BAPSA, Democratic Students Union, Northeast Students’ Forum and others, came out in solidarity with Imam.

“We stand in firm solidarity with Sharjeel Imam and demand the revocation of all cases against him immediately. We condemn in the strongest terms the Islamophobia of media and police against the anti-CAA protesters,” said their joint statement.

210,['28/01/2020'],Six-laning of bypass highway likely by 2021,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Visakhapatnam: If everything goes according to plan, the widening (six-laning) of the 51-km-long Anandapuram-Anakapalle road—via Pendurthi and Sabbavaram—is likely to be completed by July 2021.

The expansion of the Anandapuram-Anakapalle section into six lanes has picked up pace. So far, however, only 18 km of the stretch has been completed. The project is being executed by Madhya Pradesh-based Dilip Buildcon Limited under the Bharatmala Pariyojana scheme.

Speaking to TOI, P Shiva Shankar, the project director of NHAI’s Vizag unit, said that 330 hectares—including 190 hectares of private land—was required for the project. “Due to some technical issues, such as identifying genuine owners of private land in some areas, there was a delay in acquiring land in around 7.2 km of the stretch. The process of land acquisition and issue of compensation will be completed in a couple of months,” said Shiva Shankar.

“We are hoping that the project will be completed before the deadline (July 2021), as the government wants to complete the project as early as possible,” Shiva Shankar added.

A senior police officer with the traffic wing said that the six-laning of the Anandapuram-Anakapalle stretch of the highway will be a boon for commuters in Vizag as the project will clear at least 40 per cent of the traffic congestion on the highway stretch within Vizag city limits.

Once the project is complete, heavy vehicles plying on Srikakulam road to Vijayawada route will be diverted at Anandapuram to reach Anakapalle without passing through Vizag city.

Similarly, vehicles heading towards Srikakulam from Vijayawada can be diverted from Anakapalle to Anandapuram where the original Chennai-Kolkata highway connects.

The widening of the Anandapuram-Pendurthi-Anakapalle corridor and the 13.6-km stretch between Sabbavaram and Sheelanagar port connectivity has been sanctioned by the Union government for Rs 3,000 crore, including a compensation amount of Rs 700 crore for those who gave up land for the project.

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Monday refused to set aside an AAP government notification permitting free travel for women in Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses, only on the ground that it did not cover cluster buses.

The court said if free travel for women was being also enforced in cluster buses running in the city without a notification then such action would be “bad” but could not be termed illegal.

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar declined to entertain a plea challenging the notification providing free travel for women on buses operated by DTC in Delhi.

“The notification does not say the scheme is applicable on cluster buses. We cannot believe it on your statement. It does not talk of cluster buses. If Delhi government has made it applicable on cluster buses, then the notification is not bad, their action is....you challenge that before a single judge. File a better petition,” the court told the petitioner.

In the plea, the petitioner, which claims to represent public transport operators, including mini buses, grameen sewa, and rural transport vehicles, had assailed the notification on this ground. But sensing the bench was not inclined to grant relief, the lawyer for the petitioner sought permission to withdraw the plea and was allowed to do so.

Nainital: The protesters in Haldwani area of Nainital sang poems of poets such as Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Sahir Ludhianvi and Pash to protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) as well as proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

The 72-hour-long protest which entered its third day on Monday has seen active participation from the local residents, including several women and children from the locality making people draw comparisons to Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh protest.

The organisers said that they sang the poems of revolutionary poets such as Faiz and Habib Jalib because they are a symbol of resistance for people. “These poets braved the tyranny of the dictators and resisted the divisive nature of their policies. It is important that people participating in the protests today should be aware of these poets and their works,” said Kailash Pandey, one of the organisers of the protest. Raja Bahuguna, another protester, said, “This 72-hour-long protest in Haldwani is a testament to the fact that all sections of society are against the divisive policies of the government. The women have come out in large numbers and they are sleeping at the protest site.”

When asked about the future course of action of the protest, Pandey said that they will convene a meeting on Tuesday. “Though the three-day protest will end on Tuesday, but we have decided that our protest will not die. We will decide the future course of action in a meeting but our decision to protest the dictatorial steps won’t end,” he said.

Several cities in the hill state, including Dehradun, Nainital, Kashipur and Rudrapur have seen massive protests against CAA and NRC since the Act was passed by both houses of Parliament last year.

The couple are getting married in Chaitanya’s hometown on February 5. Instead of holding celebrations with family and friends before the wedding, the two have decided to conduct a nature walk, an awareness programme and clean-up activities at the geo-heritage site of Erra Matti Dibbalu and at Rushikonda Beach on February 4.

The 31-year-olds, both faculty at universities in Japan, have sought the support of local green organisations and the tourism department for their eco-activity. Around 25 of their colleages from Japan and friends will be part of the clean-up drive.

The couple is collaborating with organisations such as Greenface Environment Society, Citizens Association for Responsible Tourism (Cart), Sampdure and Rookie Rider to gather volunteers for the awareness and clean-up drive.

Speaking to TOI, Chaitanya said, “Both of us work in the field of disaster management and are aware of environmental issues . Theoretical contribution is not enough for sustainable solutions. Keeping our earth clean and liveable is a collective responsibility of everyone, irrespective of any nationality. Since marriage is an event of large gatherings with lots of friends and relatives visiting us, we decided to use this as an opportunity to do our bit for nature, environment and society and generate awareness on clean and safe beaches.”

Dehradun: In a relief to the business community of the city, mayor Sunil Uniyal Gama on Monday withdrew the proposal to levy licence fee on over 100 different types of businesses. The licence fee had been in the pipeline in order to raise more revenue for the Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC). Soon after it was proposed, the traders ’ association had gone on the warpath regarding the move. On Monday, they also held a protest at the DMC office but after a lengthy discussion with the mayor, it was decided that the proposed bill will be withdrawn for the time being.

Mayor Sunil Uniyal Gama told TOI, “After having discussions with the representatives of various trade unions, we have decided to postpone the proposed licencing scheme. As of now, we won’t implement it in the upcoming financial year.”

The traders expressed happiness at the mayor’s statement.

“We told the mayor that the trading community is already paying house tax to the DMC. Imposing a hefty licence fee would add considerably to our financial burden. We are thankful that he listened to us patiently and decided to withdraw the proposal,” said Sunil Masson, general secretary of Doon Udyog Vyapar Mandal.

Vipin Nagalia, president of the vyapar mandal, added, “Presently, the country is facing an economic slowdown due to which there is a fall in the revenue of traders. Imposing an additional cess in such a scenario is not justified at all.”

To recall, the DMC had mooted the proposal regarding imposing a licence fee on more than 100 different kinds of businesses in the city on January 19. Currently, only nine different kinds of businesses are required to pay licence fee to the corporation.

Police officials stated as more and more fraudsters use technology to dupe victims, police are often left in the lurch when it comes to identfying and understanding the tools used in the crime. The delay allows fraudsters to get away with their crime.

“While investigating cases we have seen that the fraudsters are using recent technologies while committing the crime. By the time we are able to understand the technology, precious time has been lost. The need of the hour is to stay abreast with latest technologies,” said a senior police official.

Officials in the cybercrime wing have taken part in two seminars in the city in the last five months where experts from social media platforms and digital app companies were present to help the police get accustomed to the latest developments in technology.

At least 50 cybercrimes are reported in the state every day on average, across different cybercrime police stations across the state. Most of these crimes originate on a social media site, with a fraudster posting an advertisement, and ends on an online application in which an unsuspecting victim sends money to the fraudster in exchange for a product or service.

An investigating officer has to first understand how a social media site works, said an official, followed by sound knowledge of the technology behind different payment applications so that time is not wasted during the course of the investigation.

“While investigating the case they should only try to find out from where and how the crime originated and then zero-in on the accused. Even if we cannot nab the accused, we can recover the stolen amount and return it to the victim,” the official added.

Besides staying updated on technology, the police has also launched awareness initiatives for users of social media sites and online applications through displaying slides at film theatres, circulating pamphlets and booklets, conducting workshops in schools and colleges, requesting bank official to alert customers through SMS and by hosting radio programmes.

Thiruvananthapuram: To protest against the stalemate in the construction sector, All Kerala Government Contractors’ Association and the Kerala government contractors’ joint action council are planning strikes in the coming days. A joint council of government contractors is planning an indefinite strike in front of the Secretariat from March 4.

AKGCA and the Kerala government contractors’ joint action council conducted separate press meets to announce the strike.

AKGCA, during a press meet on Thursday, said they decided to boycott all the tenders of government departments from January 20 over the delay in releasing pending arrears worth around Rs 4,000 crore. The association has started boycotting tender of public works department, local self-government department and irrigation department.

They said the government owed the contractors Rs 4,000 crore and was harassing them with new rules. “The local self government has to release dues worth Rs 1,300 crore for the past eight months. While PWD owed Rs 2,200 crore, other departments owed Rs 500 crore,” AKGCA members said.The joint action council asked the government to revise the bill discount project so that banks release funds after accepting invoice acceptance statement. “The government can pay back the money with interest based on its financial condition,” said Varghese Kannampally, president of Kerala government contractors’ association. New orders are brought to increase the burden of contractors. The government is now demanding capability certificates of the contractors from banks, and they are made compulsory to renew the licence that costs around Rs 50,000. The defect liability period has been raised to five years. The incentive for completing work on time has been stopped. The government has denied GST of 2017-18, 18-19 to contractors, and they are getting notices to pay service tax, the contractors alleged.

The joiny action council said that they are organizing a mass meeting at Thiruvananthapuram on February 3 to explain about the crisis in the state’s construction sector wherein experts in various areas and socio-political leaders will be present. From March 4 onwards, members from Kerala government contractors’ association, electrical contractors association, LSDG contractors association and PMGSY contractors association will take part in a relay fast. From April 13, the protesters will gherao the collectorate and Secretariat.

Trichy: A group of on-field assessors deputed by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) inspected all the four zones of Trichy corporation on Monday as part of the Swachh Survekshan 2020, a pan-India cleanliness ranking. The three-day-long direct observation by the assessors will play a crucial role in deciding the rank of Trichy in the national cleanliness survey.

The four-member team visited Srirangam, Ponmalai, Ariyamangalam and K Abishekapuram zones. Residential and commercial localities such as Chithirai streets, Sangliyandapuram, Rockins Road, Collector Office Road and Duraisamipuram were inspected by the team.

“The assessors visited places including transport hubs, markets. They updated their inference online,” an official source with the corporation said. To ensure transparency, another team from the Union ministry monitored the assessment team.

The assessment team will validate the claims of the civic body in public hygiene as mentioned in the documents submitted to the Swachh Bharat Mission. Claims of periodical maintenance of public toilets and night sweeping activities in commercial streets will be randomly checked. If any false claims are found, negative marks will be awarded. \

The assessment is likely to conclude on Wednesday. Sources said that a separate team from New Delhi had completed analysis on the city’s open defecation free (ODF) status in the last two days. Of the total 6,000 marks in the survey, 1,500 are earmarked for direct observation which is underway. Similarly, 1,500 are allotted for the certification category which analysed the ODF status.

224,['28/01/2020'],Formation of vending panel an uphill task for corporation,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Trichy: Constituting the vending committee to streamline the operations of street vendors in a manner not affecting public mobility continues to be an uphill task for the Trichy City Corporation. Lack of cohesive efforts from the stakeholders to sensitize, persuade and relocate street vendors are said to be the reasons for the failure to find a solution.

Soon after the state government amended the Tamil Nadu Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Scheme 2015, Trichy City Corporation should have constituted the vending committee. The committee comprising the representatives of street vendors, local body officials, city police personnel and NGOs will earmark space for street vendors to set up stalls in a manner not disturbing the vehicular traffic. After much delay, the civic body initiated the process to constitute the committee in August 2019. Subsequently, the corporation enumerated the street vendors and issued ID cards to a few. But the efforts faced a major setback with a section of street vendors approaching Madras high court alleging that the enumeration process was incomplete, and obtained a stay order against conducting the election to form the vending committee. The committee will have 15 members from various departments including six members who are directly elected by street vendors as their representatives.

“We have been trying to meet corporation commissioner to appraise the need of constituting a vending committee in vain. Joint discussion is the need of the hour,” K Suresh, a CPI functionary, said. Among the 4,000 street vendors surveyed by the civic body, around 2,000 were given ID cards. Those who did not receive ID cards were in the perception that they cannot vote in the election. However, corporation officials clarified that having their names in the survey is adequate for the street vendors to vote. The clarification, however, has failed to appease the street vendors.

Earlier, Deepavali and Pongal festivals were stated as excuses to hold discussions with the street vendors’ union for vacating the stay order. Trade unions blamed the civic body for not convening a meeting of all the unions of street vendors to find an amicable solution to conduct the election. “Soon we will conduct a meeting of street vendors to lift the stay order amicably and form the vending committee,” a civic body official said.

NEW DELHI: A political scrap broke out over the award of Padma Shri to Adnan Sami , with BJP taking on Congress after the opposition party criticised the selection, saying Sami was the son of a Pakistan airforce pilot, by claiming Sonia Gandhi ’s family’s alleged praise for Mussolini.

PANAJI: In a move aimed at propagating turmeric cultivation in the state, Old Goa-based ICAR-Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute (CCARI) will set up a turmeric processing unit at its premises. The initiative, that will be taken up in the upcoming financial year, is expected to boost the turmeric trade for the state’s spice farmers.“Curcumin boasts of anti-cancerous properties. We plan to establish a processing unit here that will encourage farmers to cultivate turmeric. The crop grows very well in Goan soil. Also, it can be cultivated as an inter-crop in cashew orchards, thus bringing additional income to farmers,” said ICAR-CCARI director EB Chakurkar.The institute is already carrying out studies on the various properties of turmeric such as the estimation of its curcumin, production capacity and per hectare yield.“We can provide the technology, but the execution must be done by the state government through the agriculture department and Agriculture Technology Management Agency (ATMA),” Chakurkar said.ATMA’s North Goa wing is already in the process of large-scale cultivation of cultivating turmeric.“ICAR-CCARI has recommended the cultivation of the Pratibha variety of turmeric. We will take saplings from them and distribute them among farmers by May. We will start planting them at nurseries across the state in June,” said ATMA’s North Goa project director Dilip Paranjape.While turmeric has medicinal properties, its frequent use in Indian kitchens as a cooking ingredient gives the crop a wide market. ATMA now plans to conduct a spices exposure visit for farmers to Karnataka and Kerala.“First we want to motivate farmer groups to raise the crop so that each can grow about 2,000 saplings.

Dehradun: Acting on a complaint filed by a Pauri Garhwal based RTI activist Santosh Mamgain, national commission for backward classes has issued direction to Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna (HNB) University to probe the complaint against the recruitment of an assistant professor on the basis of a caste certificate against the reservation norms in 2012.

Mamgain, who also heads the Society for Revolution against Corruption, based in Srinagar, had given a detailed complaint that chronologically explained the illegality of the appointment of the assistant professor. The RTI activist said, “The assistant professor belongs to Jat community which is not under the reservation quota but the university officials still appointed him in 2012. I had written to the commission to take action against the university and the assistant professor.”

On January 7, the commission had written to registrar and vice-chancellor of HNB Garhwal University to conduct an inquiry into the matter and take strict action. The commission has sought the follow-up action of the complaint to be submitted within 15 days of receiving the letter signed by undersecretary, J Ravishankar. Mamgain said, “The assistant professor, Yoga department, continues to work in the university. I had called up the SDM (Gwalior) in Madhya Pradesh, who had issued the caste certificate and he told me that the Jat community is given reservation in the state but not in any central government university.”

The RTI activist is surprised that in spite of the clear direction that the post was for reserved category in 2012 still, the university officials at that time made the appointment in violation of all reservation norms.

Meanwhile, the university registrar, AK Jha, said on Monday, “The vice-chancellor has constituted an inquiry panel of senior professors to look into the matter and report within a week. The commission shall also be apprised about the outcome of the committee report.”

234,['28/01/2020'],Sedition case: Raids on in state to nab Sharjeel Imam,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Sharjeel Imam

PATNA: More than half a dozen locations in Jehanabad and state capital Patna have been raided by a joint team of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar police in the past 48 hours to arrest Jawaharlal Nehru University student Sharjeel Imam in a sedition case .

After Saturday night’s raid at Imam’s ancestral house at Kako in Jehanabad, the joint team raided several places in Patna, including at Sabzibagh in Phulwarishariff, where a 24-hour Shahin Bagh-like protests are on.

Imam, one of the early organisers of the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protest at Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, had allegedly made “seditious” statements at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) by giving a call to cut off Assam from the rest of India.

Jehanabad SP Maneesh told TOI that raids were carried out at his ancestral place at Kako Bazar. He added that some family members were quizzed by the joint team. Intelligence sleuths also interrogated Imam’s close relatives and a few of them have been detained.

Cases have been lodged against Imam in Aligarh, Assam and Delhi for allegedly giving a provocative speech at AMU on January 16, a video of which went viral on social media.

“We are cooperating with the police teams from outside the state in their investigation. There is no case pending against Imam here,” the SP said.

Sources said some relatives of Imam live in Patna as well. “Some family members of Sharjeel stay in Patna. We can’t share more information related to the investigation as it’s a sensitive issue. Senior officials are monitoring the operation,” an officer posted at the police headquarters in Patna said.

Sharjeel wrote on his Facebook profile that he is from Patna and did his schooling from St Xavier’s High School here as well as DPS-Vasant Kunj in Delhi. Later, he joined IIT-Bombay from where he did his post-graduation in computer science. He also worked as an IT programmer at the University of Copenhagen before coming to JNU, where he is a student at the Centre for Historical Studies.

His family members have defended him by claiming that his statements have been exaggerated. “I initially tried to stop Sharjeel when he insisted that we have to fight against CAA and NRC. It is true he is against NRC and CAA but his statement has been blown out of proportion. Now, everyone is after him,” Sharjeel’s mother told a news channel at Jehanabad on Monday.

Sharjeel’s uncle Arshad Imam claimed that Sharjeel is being used for political mileage in Delhi elections. “It is true that Sharjeel started the dharna at Shaheen Bagh and said we should protest NRC, CAA and NPR. Every Indian has the right to express his opinion and he did the same through the dharna…His entire speech of 40 minutes has been cut to 40 seconds to create a wrong impression about him, possibly for political reasons in Delhi elections,” Arshad said.

Meanwhile, another video of Sharjeel has surfaced, in which he is heard asking people sitting on dharna in a village reportedly in Gaya district to come out of villages and block national highways in a bid to cut- off vehicular movements between states.

He goes on to say that Muslim protestors should not get up from the streets “till the detention camps in Assam are closed”.

235,['28/01/2020'],Bhujbal all set to revive Boat club project,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Nashik: District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal has initiated the steps to revive his pet project : Boat club and water sports centre.

Bhujbal on Monday chaired the district planning committee meeting for deciding the outlay of the district in the next financial year, which would be sent to the state government for final approval.

The meeting was attended by MPs and MLAs of the district along with officials of the district administration, including district collector Suraj Mandhare. “The district has requested the state government to grant an additional amount of Rs 185 crore in the next fiscal that will be utilised for schemes like boat club, tribal welfare and kalagram project,” a district official said.

According to him, Bhujbal is keen to revive the boat club project that he had planned during his earlier stint as the guardian minister. “If the state government gives its nod for the additional allocation, the total outlay for Nashik district would swell to Rs 958 crore,” he said.

The boat club project, inaugurated in 2014, apparently failed to take off after the NDA government came to power. The boats procured for the project were sent to elsewhere in the state as they were gathering dust.

During Monday’s meeting, Bhujbal directed the officials to spend the remaining amount of the total allocation for the current financial year. So far, the district has received over 40% of the Rs 791 crore allocated for Nashik in this financial year.

“The guardian minister has directed the officials to speed up the work of pending projects so that remaining amount could be utilised for the benefit of the people of the district,” the official said.

Meanwhile, during his speech after unfurling the Tri-colour during the Republic Day, Bhujbal said the top priority of the present government is to ameliorate the plight of the farmers of the district and common man.

“The district administration has linked Aadhhar numbers of 1.36 lakh farmers with their bank accounts under the crop loan waiver scheme,” he said.

Bhujbal also lauded the district administration as Nashik has become the first district in the state implement the Right to Service Act. As many as 81 services have been brought under this and the officials of these departments concerned will have to dispose applications in a time-bound manner or face action.

236,['28/01/2020'],HC to hear batch of pleas on Big Temple consecration today,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Madurai: The Madras high court has adjourned a batch of cases in connection with the consecration of the Brihadeeswara Temple at Thanjavur district to Tuesday (January 28), after two advocates made mentions of the petitions about protecting the ancient monument and seeking to conduct the ceremony in Tamil.

An advocate referred to the petition filed by M Saravanan, seeking to quash the order which was passed for conducting the consecration ceremony of the Big Temple in order to protect the ancient monument as the temple management did not obtain permission from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). Similarly, another advocate made a mention of the petition filed by P Maniarasan, who is the coordinator of Thanjai Periya Kovil Urimai Meetpu Kuzhu seeking to conduct the consecration in Tamil language by Tamil archagars.

After these mentions were made on Monday, a division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran adjourned the batch of cases to Tuesday.

Saravanan, an advocate from Madurai, stated that the Brihadeeswara Temple is a declared monument as per the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958. He stated that arrangements are being made by the Thanjavur Aranmanai Devasthanam to organise the consecration of the temple on February 5. A huge pandal has been set up for the length of 178ft to house the yaga salai with 110 yaga kundams to perform various rituals.

Though arrangements are being made, the devasthanam has not obtained permission from the ASI as it is their duty to safeguard and preserve the ancient monument as per the Act. When the consecration of the temple was organised in 1997, there was a major fire accident in which 48 people were killed and several others injured. He stated that this apart, there was also a considerable damage to the ancient monument.

Hence, the petitioner moved the high court to quash the order and also sought to grant interim injunction for conducting the ceremony.

240,['28/01/2020'],Evaluation: Universities told to recover money from teachers,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Collegiate education department has once again appealed to all state-run universities to recover from teaching faculties the money they had received for evaluation of answer papers of regular college students.

The appeal, said the department, was made in line with the UGC regulation 2010, which holds that paper evaluation of students is part of teachers’ responsibility and hence, the practice of making additional payments to teachers for the same is unacceptable. After Comptroller and Accountant General had pointed out that the universities in the state had together spent over Rs 39 crore for the payment of answer paper valuation, the state government had started initiating steps to recoup the additional amount given to college teachers. However, universities have not yet been able to calculate the extra amount given to each of the evaluators.

“...the government has ordered the universities concerned to quantify the amount given to the faculty members for the evaluation of answer scripts of regular students and recover the amount urgently from them and then release the remaining 20% of the amount in connection with the fourth instalment of sixth UGC pay revision arrears to the teachers,” an order issued by the department said.

Following the government decision to withhold 20% of pay revision arrears, several college teachers had successfully challenged the same in courts. However, universities’ failure in collating the details and initiating recovery procedures have lead to a deadlock. After CAG raised flag, universities now don’t pay additional remuneration to faculties for evaluating answer papers of regular students.

“The fact is that no university is in possession of exact details regarding the amount of money given to faculties for evaluation of answer papers of regular students. Some sort of consensus has now been reached. The varsities would adopt an agreeable formula for fixing the amount to be recovered from each faculty,” sources said.

The resistance from pro-Left teachers’ unions too has diminished over the years and they too have decided to forgo the additional payment that teachers used to receive for valuation of answer papers and accept the recovery. “The UGC has only stressed that paper evaluation is part of teachers’ responsibility. This clarification came against the backdrop of more universities adopting choice-based credit and semester system, which made the evaluation process more pervasive and continual. The situation become more complex since universities started giving sanction to any number of colleges in self-financing sector. Despite all difference of opinion, we will cooperate with the government efforts,” said C Padmanabhan, president, AKPCTA; a pro-Left association of aided college teachers.

Nashik: State government’s Shiv Bhojan thali scheme received an enthusiastic response across the district on Monday with the quota of 150 plates per centre getting exhausted within the first one hour at all the centres.

As per the operators of the Shiv Bhojan Thali centre, while the thali serving time was from 12 noon to 2 pm, people started queuing up from 11.30 am. When the designated quota of 150 plates was over in the first hour, hundreds had to return disappointed.

“There are a total of four centres in the district with three in Nashik city and one in Malegaon. The response to the Shiv Bhojan thali was overwhelming everywhere. All the thalis got exhausted at every centre. However, on the inaugural day, the thali centre in Malegaon could serve only 111 plates,” said Arvind Narsikar, the district supply officer.

Asked if the number of plates would be increased due to the huge response, Narsikar said the situation was same everywhere throughout the state. Therefore, if a decision has to be taken it would be taken only at the state level.

Rekha Gotise, who runs the Shiv Bhojan centre at the district collectorate premises, said, “There has been a lot of publicity for the Shiv Bhojan thali. People have been inquiring about its availability. On Sunday, even though it was a public holiday, the thalis got exhausted in a little over an hour. On Monday, people started lining-up from 11.30 am. We have space for 45 people to sit and eat at a time. Many people who came after 1pm had to be turned away.”

Nilesh Bacchav, a resident of Satana, who was at the district collectorate for some work, said, “The Shiv Bhojan thali was on my mind ever since I arrived at the collectorate. However, when I came to the Shiv Bhojan centre, I was told that the thali was over. The government should increase the number of plates and also the timing. It felt bad to miss the Rs10 meal and instead have vada paav for Rs 12.”

The operator said that they took the names, cellphone numbers and photos of the customer who purchased the thali from them. A person cannot order more than one plate.

Nagapattinam: Despite police denying permission to hold protest called by Anti-Methane Project Movement, against the Union government’s recent amendment to the Environment Impact Assessment Notification (2006) exempting hydrocarbon projects, farmers from Mayiladuthurai in Nagapattinam district staged protest here on Monday,.

Headed by the chief coordinator of the Anti-Methane Project Movement T Jayaraman, farmers, members of the movement and cadres from various political parties gathered at Chinna Kadai Street in Mayiladuthurai and raised slogans.

It was issued in response to a request by companies including Vedanta Ltd for exemption from public hearing, Jayaraman alleged while addressing the protest.

He also condemned union government’s decision and warned that people would not allow any companies to explore natural gas and oil from their soil as he would carry out a series of protest across the delta. No project should be executed in the country without taking the consent of the people, he further stated.

They raised slogans and spoke about the ill-effects of the ongoing exploration projects at various places in delta region and the state of farmers who forgo their fertile lands for the projects.

Representative image

TRICHY/CHENNAI: A 38-year-old BJP functionary was hacked to death by a gang near the busy Gandhi Market in the heart of Trichy on Monday. F Vijaya Raghu, a resident of Pensioner Colony in Varaganeri and the party’s Palakkarai mandal secretary, died at a hospital later.

A cycle stand keeper at Gate number 6 of Gandhi Market, Vijaya Raghu was engaged in his work around 7am when two people arrived, hacked him on the head and sped away. He sustained grievous injuries and was rushed to the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) where he died due to the injuries. One of the attackers was identified as Mohammed Babu, 20, of Uppu Parai, and the other a daily wager at Gandhi Market. While the police blamed previous enmity for the killing, the victim’s brother claimed that Raghu was threatened by some members of the Social Democratic Party of India for organizing a pro-CAA protest in Trichy.

BJP functionaries were quick to allege that the murder was committed by communal forces. A group of party cadre gathered in front of MGMGH and blocked the road demanding immediate arrest of the accused. A police team arrived and tried to pacify the protesters, but vehicular traffic was affected for more than an hour. A section of traders downed shutters in the Gandhi Market area following the incident. Police said Mittai Babu was a ganja addict with a history of petty offences and had come out on bail on January 11 in one such case. Police said preliminary inquiries revealed there was previous enmity between Raghu and Babu as the accused used to stalk the victim’s minor daughter.

“The murder happened due to some personal motive and no communal angle was involved in it. We have formed five special teams to nab the culprits”, Trichy central zone IG and city police commissioner in-charge A Amalraj told reporters. However, N P Senthilkumar, the victim’s younger brother, said in a police complaint that his brother had told him earlier that some members of the SDPI had threatened him for being actively involved in organizing a rally in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act in Trichy a few weeks ago. They also threatened to eliminate Raghu with the help of Mittai Babu, he said. Gandhi market police have registered a case.

Former Union minister Pon Radhakrishnan was among those who attended the funeral of the BJP functionary in the evening. Radhakrishnan raised apprehensions about the law and order situation in the state saying the government was losing grip over it and anti-social and extremist elements have taken charge. Police also failed to act against such forces and turned ineffective, he said. “Several BJP and Hindu organisations’ functionaries have been murdered. I call these murders pre-mediated and a declared war against Hindus,” said Radhakrishnan at Chennai airport. He claimed that collectors of certain districts were also feeling unsafe as police were not taking action against anti-social elements and Muslim extremists. Radhakrishnan alleged the DMK and Congress were supporting anti-social elements and remained mute when Hindus were killed.

DEHRADUN: The state health department has issued an alert and advisory against Novel Coronavirus (nCoV), a cousin of the SARS virus, which has infected thousands of people in China since last month. With the state sharing land borders with China and Nepal, the health department has issued separate alert to border districts and extra ambulance and staff were deployed in local health centres as a precautionary measure.Director General (DG) health, Dr Amita Upreti, while briefing the media on Monday regarding the preparations of nCoV, said that though cases of the virus attack have been reported in Thailand, Japan and South Korea, “since China is our neighbouring country, India is taking all precautions from the same”. The health department has also ordered all the government hospitals to monitor every suspected case of the deadly virus and send daily reports to the concerned heads.“The integrated disease surveillance machinery has been put on alert as a usual readiness measure. Any suspected case would be taken straight to the isolation wards to be set up at government hospitals,” she said, adding that the common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.“We will also be creating awareness among the masses regarding the same and to alert people that one should not take the above mentioned symptoms lightly,” said DG health, adding that advisories have also been issued to Jolly Grant and Pant Nagar airports to ensure that if anyone is entering the state from countries or areas where the virus attack is prevailing, they should inform the health department and conduct proper health screening.A WHO note on nCoV states, “Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.” Coronaviruses are zoonotic which means they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans.

Dehradun: In a unique in-depth study of country’s rivers, as part of river habitat initiative, a survey team will use state-of-the-art scientific tools and techniques such as laser-based distance measurement units for channel width determination, sonar-based channel depth estimator, doppler-based river flow determination, GPS and GIS technology in combination with the local traditional knowledge of the riverside communities for river conservation. The initiative will include 10 rivers and cover more than 4,000 km of rivers in eight states in the Ganga basin. The rivers to be mapped by Doon-based WII, including Ganga, Ramganga, Yamuna, Gomti, Ghagra, Gandak, Koshi, Son, Chambal and Rupnarayan — from source to their respective confluences.

Director-general of NMCH, Rajiv Ranjan Mishra, in the first national Ganga council meeting held recently at Kanpur had stressed on the need to safeguard the biodiversity of the important species of Ganga such as Gangetic dolphin, which is considered an important indicator of Ganga’s robust aqua system. This project has been assigned to WII for scaling up the aquatic species conservation in the Ganga basin.

Director of WII, Dhananjai Mohan, said that the convergence of state-of-the-art scientific tools, techniques and community involvement makes the assessment unique and one of its kind in the country. Project in-charge SA Hussain and Ruchi Badola said that the assessment will generate baseline data on river habitat conditions based on which a roadmap will be prepared for aquatic biodiversity conservation in Ganga basin for ensuring ‘Nirmal Dhara and Aviral Dhara’ of not only Ganga but also in its tributaries.

TOI had reported that a survey conducted by WII has revealed that around 49% of the Ganga River has high biodiversity value and species of conservation concern are reappearing as the river is getting cleaner. Hussain added, “We are confident that the present work will successfully address the biodiversity and river conservation issues in the Ganga basin, which will be a model for science-based river conservation in India.”

250,['28/01/2020'],Rodent alert delays flight by over 24 hrs,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Kolkata: A rat on a Dehradun-bound Air India Airbus 319 from Kolkata forced the airline to abort the flight at Varanasi on Saturday, de-board the passengers and accommodate them in hotels for 24 hours as airline staffers looked for the rodent. However, the rat could not be found. The flight finally left for Dehradun on Monday morning.

The incident happened on January 25, which also marked the onset of the Chinese New Year — the year of rats in Chinese zodiac.

According to aviation norms, an aircraft cannot be allowed to take off with a rodent on board. It could be catastrophic if it bit through an aircraft’s wiring, which can lead to loss of control. Airline officials fumigated the flight throughout Saturday night and Sunday while maintenance workers kept watch to ensure that the rat did not chew through any cable. The plane was certified to be rodent-free before it was allowed to fly again. Airline sources, however, were unable to say if the rat had entered the flight at Varanasi airport or had taken up temporary shelter in the flight for all of 85 minutes of the journey from Kolkata to Lal Bahadur Shastri International Airport in Varanasi.

“Necessary checks were done to ensure the flight was rodent-free and it was allowed to fly out of the airport on Monday morning,” said Akashdeep Mathur, director of Varanasi airport. The flight — AI691 — was scheduled to leave Kolkata at 3.55pm. But it was delayed by 80 minutes and it finally started for Varanasi at 5.15pm.

It reached Varanasi around 6.40pm. From Varanasi, the flight was scheduled to depart at 7.20pm, but just when the flight was about to take off, passengers and crew members noticed the rat scurrying around. The plane was taken back to the apron area from the runway and the flyers were offloaded as airline staffers began fumigation to sanitize the plane.

The aircraft finally took off for Dehradun on Monday morning. The delay made the passengers furious, some of whom took to social media to vent their anger. “AI691 on 25th Jan, 1stop to Dehradun from Kolkata via Banaras was late by 1.20 hr at Kolkata airport. We were de boarded at Varanasi airport due to a rat found inside the plane. We were made to stay in a hotel. After 24hrs we still don't know when will we fly,” (sic) Imran Ahmed, a flyer, tweeted on Sunday.

TOI tried to contact the airline for an official statement, but multiple phone calls and texts went unanswered till late on Monday.

Nashik: A 30-year-old man has been arrested by Deolali Camp police for killing his 26-year-old wife following an argument at their home in Nanegaon village on Saturday night.

According to police, the suspect took a spade kept inside the house and hit it on the woman’s head, leading to her death. “We arrested the husband from the house on the same night. He was produced before a city court on Sunday and has been remanded in a day’s police custody,” a police officer said.

“The couple with their two children and the man’s mother stayed in the same house in Nanegaon village — around five-km from Deolali Camp. When the incident took place, the suspect’s mother was sleeping outside the house so that she could also guard their goats,” he added.

The suspect, his wife and their children were sleeping inside the house. “At around 10pm the husband and wife got into an argument. The suspect doubted his wife’s character. They were married for six years,” assistant police inspector Rahul More, the investigation officer, said.

“As the altercation got worse the man took the spade and hit her wife. The suspect’s mother came inside to check on the couple and saw the victim lying in a pool of blood. Soon, the villagers rushed to the house and caught the suspect. They later informed the police and a team soon reached the spot,” he added.

On the complaint of police patil of the village, the suspect was arrested by Deolali Camp police.

Visakhapatnam: To initiate transparency in tax collection, the customs department will introduce a faceless assessment system from the upcoming financial year. The system is making a trial run at the Visakhapatnam port for February and March 2019.

“In this trial run we are checking the efficiency and loopholes of the system. Indian customs will introduce the system at all ports across the country from the next financial year,” said DK Srinivas, during the international customs day programme.

Under this system consignments will be assessed by a virtual group irrespective of where the bill of entry is filed. A bill of entry is a document filed by an importer or an exporter that specifies the nature, quantity and value of goods that have landed or are being shipped out.

A customs official explained that if a bill of entry under this system is filed at one port and another port in country specialises in that specific cargo, the customs house of the second port would assess that bill no matter where it is filed.

“There had been complaints from trade bodies that seaports in India carry out assessment and examination according to their own method. Under this system there will not be any such compliant because customs house specialising in a particular cargo would asses bills for that cargo no matter at which port the entry is made,” the official said.

Madurai: Members of the Denotified Tribes Welfare Association submitted a petition to the Madurai district collector demanding that the extension granted for the Justice Rohini Commission, which was formed to examine the distribution of benefits for sub-castes coming under the other backward classes (OBC) category, should not be given. They also demanded that the sub-categorisation of the OBC status be done immediately.

Treasurer of the association, Davamani Devi, said the central government has provided 27% reservation for the OBC category. The Justice Eswaraiah Committee, which took note of the fact that there was inequality in this categorisation, recommended that the OBC quota be sub-categorised into 9% of denotified, (DNT), 9% for nomadic tribes (NT) and another 9% for the semi-nomadic tribes.

The Justice Rohini Commission, constituted by the central government in 2017 was expected to submit its recommendations in two-and-a-half years but it has gone on seeking extensions, which were preventing these communities from getting benefits, that were long due to them. “We are the natives of this land, and our DNA is said to be 70,000 years old, but we are the most deprived, while communities that have 1% representation, enjoy more than 75% of the benefits in government jobs and other welfare measures,” she claimed.

255,['28/01/2020'],Endobariatric surgery is newest weight-loss option,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Gastroenterologists from across the country participated in GPCON 2020

Nagpur: Obesity has become a public health crisis in India. Many of us are either overweight or obese. If dietary modifications, lifestyle changes and medicines (pharmacotherapy) fail, doctors go for bariatric surgery. But, such a surgery for weight loss is advisable only in highly obese people with body mass index (BMI) more than 35. Gastroenterologists from across the country and some foreign faculty discussed weight-loss surgery options for moderately obese people on Friday.

“Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is the latest minimally invasive weight-loss procedure. This process is emerging as a popular alternative to traditional bariatric surgery. Patients who don’t wish to undergo surgical interventions, prefer this option,” said Dr Saurabh Mukewar from Nagpur.

He said those who have BMI between 30 and 35 can also opt for this surgery to avoid further weight gain and health complications.

“Like any other weight-loss procedure, this surgery also requires commitment to a healthier lifestyle post-surgery. You need to make permanent healthy changes in your diet and exercise regularly to achieve long-term success,” he added.

Dr Kartik Sampath from New York said that endoscopic options can reduce complications while treating kidney stones, pancreas and intestine-related issues. Not only in bariatric surgery, advanced endoscopic procedures can be effective in treating problems in the pancreatic duct, large intestine (colon) and rectum,” he said.

Several pancreatic diseases, those that cannot be readily differentiated by non-invasive imaging techniques (CT scan/ultrasound etc) and conventional tissue sampling, can be diagnosed by endoscopy.

Leading gastroenterologist Dr Shrikant Mukewar was the conveyor of this event named as GPCON 2020. Dr Mukewar said that most advanced techniques to treat disorders regarding the digestive system are available in Nagpur now.

“We discussed the latest therapies on hepatitis B, irritable bowel syndrome (IRB), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and such commonly experienced diseases related to the digestive system. More than 1,000 general practitioners from all over India participated in this conference,” he said.

WEIGHT LOSS WITHOUT CUTS

* Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is a minimally invasive weight-loss procedure

* This method is a middle path between medicines and traditional bariatric surgery

* A suturing device is inserted from the throat down to the stomach

* Doctors then place sutures in the stomach to make it smaller

* It leads to significant weight loss

* It’s minimally invasive and hence, the risk of operative complications are reduced

* A patient can resume daily activities quickly

A 29-year-old research scholar, who returned from Tianjin in China, was admitted to the isolation ward of Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) on Monday with symptoms similar to that of coronavirus.The woman from from Chhapra, doing PhD in neuroscience, had arrived at Kolkata on January 22 and reached home the next day. State health department principal secretary Sanjay Kumar said the woman had 102F fever and was taken to the government hospital at Chhapra Sunday night. On Monday morning, she was brought to PMCH, where her sample was collected and sent to a virology lab in Pune.However, the woman told a section of media that she did not have fever or any symptom of coronavirus and was completely fine. But symptoms, including breathlessness, fever and cough, were marked in the form signed by her and submitted in the virology lab of PMCH.State surveillance officer Dr Ragini Mishra , who has been made the state nodal officer for coronavirus, said she got to know about this case from a phone call from the woman’s family. “On Sunday, her brother told me over phone that she had fever, cold and breathlessness. We immediately arranged a mask for her and sent her to Chhapra sadar hospital, where she was kept in isolation throughout the night. She was brought to PMCH on Monday morning,” Mishra said.“As per the Centre’s protocol, any coronavirus suspect has to be kept in an isolation ward of the hospital. Her report will most probably come on Wednesday and if it is found to be negative, we will allow her to go home,” added Mishra.The state health department will keep monitoring the woman’s family members over the next 28 days. Officials, however, said none of them had developed any symptom till now.The Centre has alerted Bihar about three other students studying at Wuhan in China, of which two are natives of Sitamarhi and one is from Muzaffarpur.

HYDERABAD: TRS continued its winning streak by romping home to victory in Karimnagar municipal corporation polls by a big margin. The result came as a shocker to Congress which did not win even a single division in the 60-member corporation. TRS won 34 divisions, BJP 12, MIM six, Forward Bloc three and independents won from five divisions.

For BJP MP from Karimnagar Bandi Sanjay, the polls were prestigious to demonstrate that Karimnagar was a stronghold. However, TRS dealt a blow by winning a substantial number of divisions as counting was taken up on Monday. The mayoral post will be bagged by TRS because of the numbers it has.

That Congress has drawn a blank in the polls in Karimnagar is a reflection as to where the party stands now. Not long ago, it was wielding control over the constituency with the likes of M Satyanarayana Rao, J Chokka Rao and Ponnam Prabhakar all winners.

TimesView Desperate times, desperate measures. That’s the mantra Bengalureans are learning to live by, thanks to civic agencies which have hopelessly failed them. Doddakannelli is just another story that fits into a very predictable template — unending road works, missed deadlines and a suffering citizenry. The big picture is not very different. Sprinkling tanker-loads of water to fight clouds of dust could at best be a temporary solution. The permanent one lies in civic agencies walking the talk and upping their own game. If not for citizens, at least for the sake of restoring their own credibility.

BENGALURU: Close to half-a-lakh litres of recycled water is being sprinkled every day on Gear School Road of Doddakannelli , off HSR Layout, to mitigate the ill-effects of deteriorating air quality in the area. The road is bathed in dust, thanks to the digging work undertaken by the department of major roads and Bangalore Water Supply and Sewage Board (BWSSB).The one-km Gear School Road connects Panathur on Sarjapur Road to Marathahalli on Outer Ring Road (ORR). Residents are using eight tanker-loads of water daily to tackle the dust menace on the stretch.The drive was initiated on January 23 and residents are shelling out Rs 1,500 every day for this exercise. Famy Rasheed, a resident of Assetz East Point, said, “We are left with no choice but to do this ourselves and will continue doing this till the time we can afford it. Government officials need to step in and thoroughly complete the work.”Several months ago, the BWSSB dug up the road to lay water pipes and refilled the trenches. But the road wasn’t asphalted and the water board is now laying underground sewage pipelines. Plumes of dust rise from the road every time a vehicle passes by.Residents were told work would be over by December 15, 2019, but that didn’t happen. In another assurance, the MLA of the area, Arvind Limbavali tweeted that work would be completed by January 18, but this deadline too has lapsed.Four tankers sprinkle water at 4 in the morning and return 12 hours later for another round of the same drill. The water being used is the excess water from sewage treatment plants (STP) from two apartments — Assetz East Point and Adarsh Palm Retreat — on the road.Vasanthi Adarsh, a resident of Adarsh Palm Retreat said, “I have been living in this area for over 10 years now. Years ago, the road used to be in an excellent condition. Over the last two years, it has become pathetic.”Vasanthi says the road has three big schools and the dust kicked up by vehicles is threatening the health of children. “We realised there’s no point in waiting for the authorities to finish their work. It’s we who have to take care of our health. Hence, this initiative,” she added.A BWSSB officer said they are trying their best to finish work within the next one week. “Only installation of chambers is pending. Once that’s done, we will ask the BBMP to asphalt the road.”R Chandrasekhar, AEE, BBMP, said, “I agree there’s a slight delay in work. I know residents are facing a lot of trouble due to dust. As the road is comparatively narrow, the work has resulted in traffic congestion. But I’m also aware that BWSSB is sending three batches of labourers daily to finish work at the earliest.” Chandrasekhar said the BBMP is ready to asphalt the road as soon as BWSSB’s work gets over.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73686970,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-213246,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/residents-spend-rs-1500-daily-to-get-50k-litres-of-water-sprinkled-on-dusty-road/articleshow/73676151.cms

BENGALURU: A criminal complaint has been filed against bouncers of a star hotel in central Bengaluru and two others for allegedly manhandling two youths during a late-night party on Sunday. The duo accused the managers of the hotel of not intervening during the scuffle.

Complainant P Bharghava, 21, of Papaiah Garden in Banashankari III Stage, said he and his four friends walked into the hotel’s party hall on Sunday night and had dinner. “We were enjoying DJ music when a few men fought with us for no reason and complained to the bouncers. Without hearing us, the bouncers pushed us out and in the melee, one hit me near my left eye. We approached one of the hotel managers, Biddappa, saying the bouncers should apologise to us. Some more men beat us again when we came to the parking lot,” read Bharghava’s complaint.

“Two men came out of a white car — KA 50-P-7719 — and attacked us. One of them pulled out a knife and attacked my friend Sankalp. No one came to our rescue. A little later, police, who arrived in a Hoysala vehicle, shifted Sankalp to a private hospital. We found that the DJ music and related events were illegal as the hotel management had no permission. The knife attack on us shows security is weak...” Bhargav added.

High Grounds police said they have issued notice to the hotel management and are looking for the accused mentioned in the FIR.

The development is significant as the inclusion of new sites will help the cash-strapped Punjab fetch more funds from the central government and different agencies for maintenance of the ecological character of its wetlands.

Of three new Ramsar wetlands, Keshopur-Miani community reserve in Gurdaspur is spread over an area 343.9 hectare and is is natural. On the other hand, 185-km stretch of the Beas conservation reserve, and Nangal wildlife sanctuary spread in an area of 116 ha in Ropar, are both man-made. The already existing Ramar sites include Harike, Kanjli and Ropar wetlands, covering a total area of 56.48 square kilometre.

The Ramsar Convention signed on February 2, 1971, is one of the oldest inter-governmental accord signed by members countries to preserve the ecological character of their wetlands of international importance. Wetlands declared as Ramsar sites are protected under strict guidelines of the convention.

Principal chief conservator of forests and wildlife Kuldip Kumar said that inclusion of three more wetlands would help the state government in carrying out the conservation of wetlands in more effective way. “Of total 12 wetlands in Punjab, six are now Ramsar sites. This was made possible due to hard work put in by the entire team involved in preparing the proposal in association with WWF-India,” said Kumar, who is also the chief wildlife warden of Punjab. He added that they were in the process of submitting proposal for declaring two more wetlands in the state as Ramsar sites.

WWF-India coordinator Gitanjali Kanwar, who was part of the team which prepared the proposal, said that the three new sites met more than three conditions required for getting the tag. Kanwar said wetlands conformed to the criterion of supporting the population of plant/animal conserving species important for maintaining the biological diversity of the area, and significant proportion of indigenous fish sub-species. They also fulfilled the condition of supporting vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered species, besides each wetland being home to more than 2,000 birds.

Selection criteria

To be named as a wetland of international importance, the wetland must fulfil at least one or more of the nine conditions based on ecological characteristics, biodiversity which includes mammals, water birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and other species.

Nine in the region

There are nine Ramsar sites in the region of which six are in Punjab and three in Himachal Pradesh. The wetlands in Himachal Pradesh with international tag include Chandra Taal, a high-altitude lake on the upper Chandra valley, which was declared a Ramsar site in November 2005. The other two are Pong dam lake and Renuka lake which got the tag in August 2002 and November 2005.

264,['28/01/2020'],TRS bags shot-calling rights in 119 urban local bodies,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Hyderabad: The Telangana Rashtra Samithi ( TRS ) has bagged chairperson and mayor posts in 119 urban local bodies (ULB) of total 127 in the state, indirect elections for which were held on Monday. They include 110 municipalities and nine municipal corporations .

The Telangana State Election Commission (TSEC) has postponed election in two municipalities —Neredcharla and Medchal. In Neredcherla, the election for chairperson was postponed as there was controversy over allowing ex-officio membership to Rajya Sabha MP KVP Ramchander Rao while in Medchal, the election was deferred to Tuesday as parties were yet to select their candidate for the post.

Elsewhere, Congress has secured the top post in four ULBs — Waddepally, Chandur, Manikonda and Turkayamjal while the BJP and AIMIM secured two each in Amangal, Maktal and Bhainsa, Jalpally respectively. The TRS was aided by ally AIMIM in securing the mayor post in Nizamabad. In other places, independents either joined or extended their support to TRS to get chairperson or mayor posts.

The TRS leadership deputed ex-officio members such as MPs, MLAs and MLCs to bag the top posts in the urban bodies. They also managed to draw support from other independents and party rebels. For instance in Meerpet, while the required number of seats for mayor is 24 wards (out of 46), the TRS managed only 19. However, the party managed to bring in all eight independents, including 3 rebels, to the party-fold in order to bag the mayor’s post.

In Kollapur, where several party rebels had demanded posts, the TRS gave its own candidates the posts to send a message that it will not tolerate “indiscipline.” Most rebels relented and extended their support to the party in elections for chairperson and vice-chairperson.

265,['28/01/2020'],There will be no power cuts this year: M M Mani,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Despite no substantial improvement in power generation, the state would continue to manage without power cuts this year as well, electricity minister M M Mani said. Arrangements were in place for managing power requirements of the state, the minister said on Wednesday adding that if need arises, more power would be brought from outside the state. “Water in major reservoirs would last till June. Kudankulam power highway would enhance the state’s capacity to bring more power from outside. Hence, the question of power cut doesn’t arise at all,” he said.

KSEB, meanwhile, is going ahead with the plans for setting up a second power generation unit in Idukki using the existing reservoir. Mani was talking to reporters after signing an agreement between KSEB and Tata Solar Power for generation of 35MW solar power from rooftop installations. Other two agencies that have been shortlisted by KSEB for setting up and operating roof mounted solar power generating units in the state include state government agency INKEL and Waarees, a solar panel manufacturing company. “With increasing public resistance to take forward hydel power projects such as Athirappally for which KSEB had already obtained necessary clearances from agencies concerned, we need to focus more on solar power generation,” he said. “Kerala is planning to scale up its solar power generation capabilities to 1,000MW. This presently is below 200MW. During the initial phase, the empanelled agencies together would ensure generation of 46.5MW solar power from rooftop solar units. Of this, 23MW would be from house rooftops, 14MW from other private rooftops and 9.5MW using government buildings. The target set for generation from roof top units is 500MW. The rest 500MW would be generated using floating solar panels to be deployed in reservoirs, including Idukki dam. The board had deployed floating panels in Banasurasagar dam on a pilot basis. Feasibility studies have proven that Idukki dam would be able to hold such panels that could generate up to 400MW solar power.”

Three patients in isolation ward

BENGALURU: People with travel history to China and other countries in its neighbourhood are knocking on the doors of Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD), seeking clinical examination to ensure all is well. This despite the fact that they haven’t shown any symptoms of the novel Coronavirus (nCOV).Seeing the panicky reaction, the hospital on Monday called for an emergency meeting to set up a help desk to handle queries pertaining to the new virus infection. “Anyone with a doubt can approach us. However, there’s no need to panic. So far, there have been no positive cases,” doctors at RGICD said.Hospital sources said seven persons came to them with queries on Monday alone, but officials maintained there were just two such instances.“A man approached us stating his wife had recently travelled from Delhi to Bengaluru by air. Apparently, she sat next to a man who looked like a Chinese national. She has had fever for the last two days and the family is worried. We suggested he bring his wife for a check-up,” said Dr C Nagaraja, director, RGICD. In another similar instance, a person sought check-up at the hospital stating that he had recently travelled to Hong Kong.“Given the alarm, the number of such cases seeking clinical examination is likely to increase,” said health department authorities.Screening of passengers returning from China began at Kempegowda International Airport from January 20. Those reaching Bengaluru and Mangaluru from China are now being screened and a health surveillance team will be tracking them for 14 days.Currently, RGICD’s isolation ward has three patients with travel history to China. Two of them got themselves admitted on Sunday night with symptoms of cold and fever. The 37-year-old woman and the 22 year-old man, both working in Bengaluru, have been kept in the isolation ward.A 25-year-old Yelahanka man who tested negative for the deadly virus infection is yet to be discharged.The woman, a globalsourcing professional from Jalahalli, had travelled to Foshan in China between December 22 and January 11. “After that she went to Punjab. She may not have any infection. We just wanted to get her tested, as she was in China when the infection was spreading,” her family member told TOI.The 22-year-old man returned from China in January.

Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy

HYDERABAD: Stating that CBI’s quid pro quo case against him was result of a quid pro quo arrangement between his political rivals, Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy on Monday approached the Telangana high court urging it to dispense with the need to appear before the CBI court in Hyderabad regularly.

“Allow my lawyer to represent me at the trial court under section 205 of the CrPC,” he said. He filed 11 separate pleas urging the court to grant him the relief in all the 11 chargesheets CBI had filed against him.

The requirement of physical appearance is hindering the pace of his work as chief minister and hence, should be accorded an exemption taking into consideration the public interest involved, Jagan’s counsel said.

The case is likely to be heard by the high court on Tuesday.

HYDERABAD: Choutuppal resembled a battle ground on Monday with supporters of political parties resorting to stone throwing and physical attacks during the election of municipal chairman and vice-chairman.

Police resorted to lathicharge to disperse the unruly crowds, while Congress workers staged a demonstration on the national highway alleging police highhandedness and bias in favour of the TRS .

Congress MLA from Munugode Komatireddy Rajgopal Reddy was arrested after he tore away the papers from the newly-elected councillors. In the 20-member council, TRS won eight divisions, Congress five, CPM three, while an independent bagged one division.

Later, two separate cases were filed against Congress workers for attacking two CPM councillors. A similar situation prevailed in Yadadri municipality as Raj Gopal, who went there also, objected to CPM elected councillors’ decision to support the TRS.

KT Rama Rao

HYDERABAD: All elected members in urban local bodies will undergo training on the new Municipalities Act, municipal administration and urban development (MA&UD) minister KT Rama Rao said on Monday. The move comes as the government now plans to focus on urban development, planned growth and corruption-free governance in municipalities. Around 43% of the of the state’s population resides in urban areas.

KTR said that the training will be initiated with an aim to increase accountability among elected members and will be on the lines of ‘Palle Pragati, Pattana Pragati’ (progress of urban areas). “Like gram panchayats, the government would release Rs 173 crore in the first week of every month towards matching grant of the central finance commissions grant of Rs 1,037 crore a year for development of infrastructure,” he said and added that the government was giving importance to green cover improvement in the state. “10% funds (of municipalities) should be earmarked for green cover improvement,” KTR said.

The TRS working president also said that Congress and BJP were “exposed” following developments where the two parties had helped each other secure posts in Turkayamjal, Manikonda and Maktal. “The unholy nexus between the two parties has been exposed now,” KTR said.

On using ex-officio votes, KTR said that the party had used the option granted by election commission in 1999.

270,['28/01/2020'],Congress &amp; BJP join hands to deny TRS Manikonda pie,"This story is from January 28, 2020

HYDERABAD: In a dramatic turn of events, Congress and BJP came together on Monday to pull the rug from under TRS’s feet to bag the chairperson and vice-chairperson posts in Manikonda municipality, which is predominantly a IT hub. Surprisingly, Congress had to eat humble pie in Nalgonda municipality and alleged that TRS won the municipal chairperson post thanks to the help it received from BJP with which it joined hands in Manikonda.

But, it was in Manikonda where all the drama happened with TRS trying to mobilise numbers to win the top post in the urban local body. But, Congress and BJP workers were two steps ahead of TRS by coming to an understanding and walked away with chairperson and deputy chairperson posts respectively.

Sources said former Congress MP from Chevella Konda Vishweshwar Reddy and Rangareddy district Congress workers played a big part in working out strategy with BJP. TRS working president and municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao termed it an “unholy alliance” of two national parties.

Vishweshwar told TOI that Congress and BJP came together in the interests of people of Manikonda. “There is an acute water problem in the municipal area and TRS has done nothing. Even members of Neknampur lake committee were in favour of Congress-BJP coming together to keep out TRS,” he said.

“I gave the go-ahead after an understanding was reached between local Congress and BJP leaders. We will continue to fight against each other in every other election. This understanding in Manikonda is for the welfare of the people and confined to Manikonda only,” he added.

BJP Telangana president K Laxman said local party leaders worked out the agreement with Congess for development of the municipality. “The BJP state-level leadership has no role in the Congress-BJP understanding in Manikonda. The BJP state leadership does not think on the lines of going along with Congress,” Laxman said.

In Narsingi municipality also, Congress and BJP tried to come together but TRS outwitted the two national parties by luring a BJP ward member. He had assured Congress of supporting it, but went missing. His supporters claimed he did not return after going out to brush his teeth early in the morning.

BJP workers led by MP Arvind Dharmapuri (right corner) at voting for Nizamabad municipal corporation mayor.

HYDERABAD: After intense politicking, Dandu Neethu Kiran of TRS on Monday got elected as mayor of Nizamabad municipal corporation with the support of AIMIM. BJP , which had emerged as the single largest party, winning 28 of the 60 divisions, declared that it was not interested in chasing its dream of winning the mayor post as it did not have the requisite numbers. Nizamabad MP Arvind Dharmapuri said they would rather be in the opposition since they did not have the numbers to bag the coveted post. The deputy mayor’s post was also won by TRS.

In the elections for the mayoral post on Monday, AIMIM, which emerged as the second largest party with 16 corporators, decided to support the candidature of the TRS nominee for the mayoral post, Neethu Kiran. TRS with 13 corporators was placed third in the corporation. Congress won from two divisions, while an independent won from one division.

In addition to TRS and AIMIM numbers, the combine also had the votes of ex-officio members in their favour. Six legislators —3 MLAs and 3 MLCs, all from TRS —were ex-officio members. TRS Rajya Sabha MP D Srinivas, who fell out with TRS leadership, did not register himself to vote as an ex-officio member.

New mayor Dandu Neethu Kiran, who won from 11th division, said she would strive to ensure that the city was clean and also reduce use of plastic. She said for the last 15 years her husband was in politics and it was because of him she could get to the position.

“Health will be a top priority. Drainage systems needs to be improved. Garbage lifting has to be done on a regular basis,” she said, talking about her priorities as mayor. In the 2014 elections too, TRS took support of MIM for its candidate Akula Sujatha’s election as mayor. In this election, Sujatha lost the polls.

NEW DELHI: While AAP and BJP have launched high-octane campaigns for the February 8 polls, Congress appears to be lagging behind. Though individual candidates have opened their elections offices and initiated door-to-door canvassing, the overall campaign has yet to pick pace with none of the top Congress functionaries seen on the ground.Displaced by AAP in 2013 after being in office for 15 years, Congress faces a tough electoral battle this year too, with AAP and BJP seen to be in a direct fight for a majority of the 70 seats. After a disastrous show in 2015, when it failed to win even a single seat, Congress’ vote bank — minorities, Dailts, slum-dwellers and those living in unauthorised and resettlement colonies — has gravitated towards AAP.To pose a real challenge, sources said, Congress required a concerted effort from its senior functionaries to convince people to again vote for the party. Some of the candidates TOI spoke to agreed that the central leadership could have stepped out and held group meetings even before the elections were announced.“AAP and BJP functionaries have been regularly addressing meetings and holding roadshows. With so little time left for polling, we have to cover a lot of ground,” said a candidate, requesting anonymity, adding that he had already requested for a roadshow or a big rally in his constituency, to be led by AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra or former Congress president Rahul Gandhi.AICC general secretary in charge, PC Chacko , however, said all senior functionaries would soon be on ground addressing meetings and participating in roadshows. Chacko said the Congress campaign for Delhi polls would be in “top gear” in the first week of February. “There were some initial hiccups due of lack of resources and coordination. All our candidates have now opened their offices and started door-to-door canvassing. You will soon see our central leadership campaigning in Delhi too,” Chacko said.He added that 14 MPs and 70 MLAs from neighbouring states had already reached Delhi and taken over the responsibility of supervising the preparations at district and assembly levels. “The programme of our 40 star campaigners is being worked out to ensure that all constituencies are covered,” he said, adding that the party’s focus would more be on smaller meetings and roadshows than big political rallies that require a lot of manpower and time to organise. He said interim Congress president Sonia would also address some public meetings.Another party functionary said Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra and campaign committee chairman Kirti Azad had been addressing at least 3-4 corner meetings every day. “They have already held several interactions with district, zonal and booth-level party workers apart from addressing corner meetings in various constituencies.

275,['28/01/2020'],400 volunteers to help fight forest fires in Kanyakumari,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Kanyakumari: Considering the vast forest cover and increasing incidents of fires, the fire and rescue department has started training youths from forests and adjoining areas as volunteers. They will help the fire and rescue services and forest department protect forests from fires.

“We are in the process of identifying at least 400 volunteers. They will be associated with four stations – Nagercoil, Kulasekaram, Kuzhithurai and Padmanabhapuram – as these stations have a major forest cover in their jurisdiction,” said Kanyakumari district fire officer (DFO) B Saravanababu after the first training programme on Monday.

“The programme was started on the directions of the DGP and director in-charge of the Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services department C Sylendra Babu a couple of days back. As many as 90 volunteers were identified till Monday and the rest will be identified in a couple of weeks,” the DFO said.

It is learnt that the district with one of the largest forest covers in the state has seven fire stations with only 100 fire fighters, due to which not more than 50 personnel will be on duty in the district in each of the two shifts in a day. This presses the need for volunteers especially from the forest periphery. Fighting forest fires is difficult compared to fires in urban areas due to inaccessible terrain without roads and availability of fuel in the form of dry grass, bushes and wood.

Since fire tenders would take time for the fighters to reach the nearest accessible road that is at times 25 to 30 kms from the station, the volunteers will be the first to step into action. “The best way to fight a forest fire is to stop it early before it spreads,” he said. Identification was carried out on a war footing as the number of fire calls in the district increased from 22 in December 2019 to 57 in January. At least 15 calls this month were forest fires. This is due to heavy growth of bushes and grass facilitated by rains till last month. Training and engaging them in fire-fighting will be after verification of their background by the forest and police departments. On Monday training began for 25 students of Vins Christian College of Engineering at the foothills of Chunkankadai near Nagercoil.

Nashik: The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) has decided to distribute question papers in bunches of 25 directly to all examination centres across the state this year for the HSC and SSC exams.

The board’s decision is aimed at reducing the risk of the question papers getting leaked.

“This is to be careful and avoid any instance of the question papers getting leaked. The board wants to ensure fair examination for all the students,” said Nitin Upasani, the divisional secretary, Maharashtra state secondary and higher secondary education office, Nashik division.

Till last year, the board used to send the question papers in bunches of 50s and 100s, which were kept in the custody offices of the board’s examination centres. “There is no way the papers can be opened mid-way between the printing press and the examination centres. But while at the examination centres, the big bunches of question papers had to be opened and segregated according to the required number of papers in the examination hall,” Upasani told TOI.

According to Upasani, the question papers will be kept in the board’s custody offices two days before the examination with ample security. For an exam scheduled between 11 am to 2 pm, the question papers will be brought to the respective examination centres by 10.30 am. By 10.40 am, the question papers will reach the examination halls where the sealed envelopes will be opened.

277,['28/01/2020'],ACS Khanna to probe felling of 24k trees along Bist Doab canal,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Bathinda: Punjab chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh informed the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Monday that additional chief secretary (ACS) and financial commissioner (development) Viswajeet Khanna had been asked to inquire into the alleged felling of 24,700 trees along the Bist Doab canal here.

The state’s top bureaucrat, in an affidavit submitted to the tribunal, said the ACS would enquire into violations of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and fix responsibility.

The affidavit was submitted on the basis of NGT’s orders of January 10, when the matter of violations had come to the tribunal’s notice, but no one appeared to represent the Punjab chief secretary and secretary of irrigation. Then, NGT bench comprising Justice Raghuvendra S Rathore and Siddhanta Dass had directed the chief secretary to file a personal affidavit on January 27 to apprise why the matter had not been inquired.

The tribunal also directed the Punjab irrigation secretary to appear in person to explain why no one appeared on his behalf. Petitioner’s counsel, Saurabh Sharma, said Delhi resident Nishant Kumar Alag had filed the petition in 2018, alleging that 24,700 trees were felled around Bist Doab canal in Punjab in 2016 in violation of the Forest (Conservation) Act. “On August 16, 2018, NGT had directed Punjab through chief secretary to appoint an inquiry officer not below the rank of additional chief secretary to prove the matter and fix responsibility of officers. The forest department had claimed that trees were under jurisdiction and supervision of the state irrigation department. The Punjab irrigation department filed an appeal in the Supreme Court, which on January 11, 2019, had dismissed the appeal and upheld the NGT order,” he said.

Sharma said chief secretary informed the NGT that ACS M P Singh had been asked to inquire intp the matter on September 2, 2019, with direction to complete the probe in two months. “The officer could not complete the inquiry and retired on December 31, 2019. Now, the CS has appointed ACS Khanna to inquire the matter and complete probe in two month. An affidavit in this regard was filed in NGT today and principal secretary (irrigation) A Venu Prasad appeared in person. The tribunal has adjourned the matter to February 10,” Sharma said.

278,['28/01/2020'],Delhi assembly elections: Congress election campaign yet to hit top gear,"This story is from January 28, 2020

AICC general secretary in charge PC Chacko

NEW DELHI: While AAP and BJP have launched high-octane campaigns for the February 8 polls, Congress appears to be lagging behind. Though individual candidates have opened their elections offices and initiated door-to-door canvassing, the overall campaign has yet to pick pace with none of the top Congress functionaries seen on the ground.

Displaced by AAP in 2013 after being in office for 15 years, Congress faces a tough electoral battle this year too, with AAP and BJP seen to be in a direct fight for a majority of the 70 seats. After a disastrous show in 2015, when it failed to win even a single seat, Congress’ vote bank — minorities, Dailts, slum-dwellers and those living in unauthorised and resettlement colonies — has gravitated towards AAP.

Complete Coverage on Delhi Elections

To pose a real challenge, sources said, Congress required a concerted effort from its senior functionaries to convince people to again vote for the party. Some of the candidates TOI spoke to agreed that the central leadership could have stepped out and held group meetings even before the elections were announced.

“AAP and BJP functionaries have been regularly addressing meetings and holding roadshows. With so little time left for polling, we have to cover a lot of ground,” said a candidate, requesting anonymity, adding that he had already requested for a roadshow or a big rally in his constituency, to be led by AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra or former Congress president Rahul Gandhi.

AICC general secretary in charge, PC Chacko , however, said all senior functionaries would soon be on ground addressing meetings and participating in roadshows. Chacko said the Congress campaign for Delhi polls would be in “top gear” in the first week of February. “There were some initial hiccups due of lack of resources and coordination. All our candidates have now opened their offices and started door-to-door canvassing. You will soon see our central leadership campaigning in Delhi too,” Chacko said.

He added that 14 MPs and 70 MLAs from neighbouring states had already reached Delhi and taken over the responsibility of supervising the preparations at district and assembly levels. “The programme of our 40 star campaigners is being worked out to ensure that all constituencies are covered,” he said, adding that the party’s focus would more be on smaller meetings and roadshows than big political rallies that require a lot of manpower and time to organise. He said interim Congress president Sonia would also address some public meetings.

Another party functionary said Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra and campaign committee chairman Kirti Azad had been addressing at least 3-4 corner meetings every day. “They have already held several interactions with district, zonal and booth-level party workers apart from addressing corner meetings in various constituencies. The Congress’ graph is only going up and that will reflect in the results,” he said.

279,['28/01/2020'],"AAP, BJP did ‘jumlebaazi’, we do not believe in lip service: Subhash Chopra","Subhash Chopra

After a disastrous 2015 assembly poll when it failed to win a single seat and its vote share plummeted to below 10 per cent, Congress this time is fighting a battle for survival in Delhi politics. Atul Mathur spoke to Delhi Congress Pradesh Committee president and former MLA

on the party’s poll agenda and why it believes people will vote for his party this time. Excerpts.

Congress lost the 2013 and 2015 assembly polls and 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections badly. Why do you think people would vote for Congress this time?

What are you promising Delhi this time?

Congress has openly supported the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests in Delhi. While the BJP has turned it into an election plank, do you think your party will also get support from those opposing the law?

The protest at Shaheen Bagh is causing a lot of inconvenience to commuters. Would you request the protesters to end their sit-in?

Whenever Congress has forged an alliance with a regional party in any state, its own vote base has shrunk. What prompted your party to ally with RJD in Delhi?

Congress has always been criticised for promoting dynastic politics. You have given ticket to children of several former MLAs including your own daughter.

In the 2013 and 2015 assembly polls, people voted for a party which was born out of a movement started by Anna Hazare and promised a corruption-free society and Jan Lokpal Bill. But then its founder-members started leaving because they realised that those who talked about a corruption-free society were themselves indulging in it. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who sat on a dharna at Rail Bhawan in 2014 to get three policemen suspended, didn’t have time to go and meet the students who were assaulted at Jamia Millia Islamia and JNU. And he is the same person who called Sheila ji a helpless chief minister. A government which can’t provide safety to women and children, can’t prevent people dying by inhaling polluted air, cannot provide clean water, can’t check price rise and take action against hoarders but blames the Prime Minister and lieutenant governor for not allowing them to work for four-and-a-half years can’t be remain in power. It was our government that introduced CNG-run public transport, privatised discoms, gave Rs240 crore to the Haryana government to build a water canal, expanded Delhi Metro and bought new DTC buses. We started the Laadli scheme to give education to the girl child. People realise that and they will vote for Congress this time.The voters were influenced by big promises made by AAP and BJP. But Delhiites have now realised that it was all ‘jumlebaazi’ (just words). Congress does not believe in lip service. We do what we promise.Congress started the monthly pension scheme for senior citizens and widows in 1998 with Rs 200 and increased it to Rs 2,500. We have now promised a pension of Rs 5,000 per month now. While Kejriwal says he will open more old-age homes, we want to empower senior citizens with more money. Their children will also be able to take better care of their parents. Water has become scarce now. We want people to save water. We will not only give 20,000 litres of water free but also give an incentive of 30 paise for every litre they save. We want to give free travel to senior citizens, students and people below poverty line. We will soon bring out our manifesto, which will have several schemes for Delhiites.I don’t think CAA is a local issue and should become an election plank. This is a national issue. Any movement which turns violent becomes weak and we are not in favour of that. But it is surprising that AAP has suddenly taken a stand on it. It realised it was not getting support of the youth and women associated with protests and that Congress was coming back to power. AAP is a creation of BJP and it is their conspiracy.I bow my head in front of the women sitting on dharna. The LG had called a meeting with these women and they have agreed to leave a lane for traffic. Their intention is not to create problems for anyone but only to save their future generations. I leave it to them to decide their course of action. It is their democratic right to stage a protest.There are a lot of Poorvanchalis in Delhi who have contributed in the development of the city. Since we have an alliance with RJD at the national level, out of respect we have given them four seats to contest.They have been given tickets on merit and not by the virtue of being children of former MLAs or ministers. Daughters of (former Delhi Speaker) Yoganand Shastri and (former MLA) Kunwar Karan Singh are active workers of Mahila Congress. My daughter has worked closely with Martin Luther King III. and travelled with him to several countries, promoting peace and working with the youth. She is highly educated and had worked in Karnataka elections for one month. She is working with All India Congress Committee’s research department. I never pushed her name and she is here by virtue of her work. We want the young generation to come forward and join politics to serve society.",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73684913,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-681492,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi-assembly-elections/aap-bjp-did-jumlebaazi-we-do-not-believe-in-lip-service-chopra/articleshow/73676888.cms

Madurai: Closed-circuit television (CCTVs) installed in Jainhindpuram, one of the areas notorious for crimes in the city, have helped bring down the crime rate drastically, city commissioner of police S Davidson Devasirvatham said on Monday. More than 70 CCTVs were installed in the area resulting in the crime rate coming down when compared to the previous year, he added.

Speaking at a function organised to dedicate 56 more CCTVs in Jaihindpuram on behalf of Suryan Friends Group Devasirvatham recalled how his earlier stint in Madurai in 2005 when the city was prone to severe crimes. In 2018, when he assumed charge, the crime rates had come down. There used to be a time when several murders used to take place in the city, but that has come down. The commissioner said that the co-operation of the people has helped bring the crime rate down, and now the centre medians and barricades on roads have helped reduce accidents. If people also came forward to wear helmets that could further help reduce accidents and loss of life, he added.

Residents who spoke at the event agreed that incidents of petty thefts and chain-snatching have come down in Jaihindpuram after the installation of CCTVs.

Nagpur: Over 500 lawyers on Monday signed a petition protesting the sudden transfer of Justice Zaka Haq to Aurangabad by Chief Justice Pradeep Nandrajog.

While demanding cancellation of the transfer order, the lawyers said the signed petition would be sent to the President of India, Chief Justice of India , Chief Justice of Bombay High Court and Maharashtra chief minister . Earlier, the High Court Bar Association (HCBA) had passed a resolution in this regard.

According to the protesting lawyers led by Sudip Jaiswal, Justice Haq was one of the upright and honest judges in the judiciary, who had taken up various PILs on issues like potholes. Due to his stringent directives to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation in this PIL, civic officials had to work overtime to fill up potholes which had become a death trap on every road after monsoon, they said.

The lawyers hailing from various courts also apprehend threat to the judge’s life due to a slew of directives passed by him while hearing various cases related to alleged mysterious death of former judge BH Loya in the city. They added that he had directed the authorities to protect all documents and records related to the judge’s death from last 10 years in original form.

283,['28/01/2020'],Nitish Kumar launches Rs 187 crore exam board schemes,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Nitish Kumar

PATNA: CM Nitish Kumar on Monday launched a series of projects of Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) worth Rs186.74 crore. The projects included examination hall-cum-administrative buildings at nine divisional headquarters in Patna, Munger , Gaya, Purnia, Saharsa, Chhapra , Bhagalpur , Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga. Each examination hall has a seating capacity of 4,000 to 5,000 examinees at a time.

Nitish also inaugurated a new administrative building of the BSEB at its headquarters, its enterprise resource planning system and a new data centre. He also announced that the ‘Unnayan Bihar’ scheme would be extended to Classes XI and XII. Under the scheme, students of Classes IX and X are taught through online and offline methods and smart television sets.

The CM lauded the role of BSEB officials in erasing the “blot of mass cheating” from the state’s forehead by holding fair examinations and publishing results of matriculation and intermediate examinations on time. He said the BSEB was doing so well that officials from other countries (read Nepal) and states (Chhattisgarh) were visiting its headquarters to learn how to hold fair examination and publish results before the stipulated time. “I am really happy over the recent improvements in the board. I thank the officials of the board and the education department for their achievements,” Nitish said.

Recalling the infamous mass cheating incident at Hajipur in 2015, Nitish said the picture showing relatives scaling a four-storey school building to pass notes to matric examinees had gone viral and brought a very bad name to the state’s board. “Every newspaper across the country had carried that photo. Also, a board topper had brought bad name by giving an unsatisfactory reply to media people. Then, we had lodged FIRs and took stringent action against all those involved in such acts,” he said.

“But now, the board has improved its efficiency and maintains transparency by use of technology in holding examinations and publishing results,” Nitish said.

He asked the board officials to be “extra careful” in use of technology because “wrongdoers” could go to any extent to defame the board by misusing the technological advancements.

The CM urged media persons to publish reports if any irregularities are found in the BSEB works. “Had you not published that school picture, we would not have initiated such action. So, you must publish any irregularities in the board’s functioning,” Nitish told the media.

State’s education minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma , chief secretary Deepak Kumar, additional chief secretary (education) R K Mahajan and BSEB chairman Anand Kishor also spoke at the event.

284,['28/01/2020'],Political process must for resolving water woes: Experts,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Aurangabad: Water management experts have underlined the need of a “political process” to resolve the water issues being faced by Marathwada.

“Water experts, lawyers, retired government officials and media have been doing their best to highlight the water problems of Marathwada, but their efforts have obvious limitations. Resolution of water problems is a political issue,” water management expert Pradeep Purandare said.

Activist Abhijit Dhanorkar said it was the collective responsibility of different stakeholders to join hands for waging a battle for the just share of the region in equitable water distribution. The stakeholders have also stressed that political parties, peoples’ organisations and political activists should study and understand the socio-economic-politico-legal complexities involved before arriving at informed decisions for framing water policies, strategies and programmes.

Coinciding with the fresh political agitation with a lead from BJP functionary Pankaja Munde, experts have released an indicative list of demands that could offer the desired relief for Marathwada.

“Top most priority needs to be given to soil conservation and river rejuvenation. There is a dire need for measurement of water and carrying out water audit. Such a measure can ensure development of resilience towards climate change,” Purandare said.

He added that the authorities concerned must prepare rules of equitable distribution of water at river-basin level and create an institutional as well as legal arrangement to implement those in letter and spirit.

“The rules should address only equitable distribution of available water. It should be left to the individual projects to decide purpose-wise distribution of water once they get their share of water,” Purandare said.

Strengthening of Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority and effective implementation of the Integrated State Water Plan are some of the key remedies the experts have pressed.

Among other demands, experts have laid emphasis on completing the operative part of Irrigation Acts by framing rules, issuing notifications and committing agreements.

“It is advisable to convert Irrigation Development Corporations into River Basin Authorities and promote water users’ associations by dissolving the Canal Advisory Committees. We have to bring lift irrigation under the purview of Irrigation Acts. It is completely un-regulated now,” Purandare said.

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation Ltd (NMSCDCL) on Monday admitted that the construction of city’s maiden smart road is “improper”.

“The riding quality on the smart road is not as per the set standard. It is uneven at some stretches,” chairman of NMSCDCL and senior bureaucrat Sitaram Kunte said after a meeting of NMSCDCL in which CEO of NMSCDCL Prakash Thavil and municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game were also present.

“It is not possible to rectify this shortfall at this juncture as construction of the road is complete. We cannot dig up road to set things right. So we have taken a decision to rope in experts from IIT-Bombay,” Kunte said.

“The experts from IIT-Bombay would examine the road and come up with the best possible solution to deal with this problem to ensure that the problem is rectified,” he added.

The 1.1-km stretch of city’s first smart road — from Ashok Stambh to Trimbak Naka — has been constructed at a cost of Rs 20 crore. The work for the project began in March 2018.

The contractor of the project missed five deadlines and has been penalized by the NMSCDCL for the same. Many elected representatives of the civic body and local residents have been questioning the quality of the road following which the NMSCDCL carried out a quality check of the entire stretch and the problem was detected.

“Although we have opened the road for traffic, work to set up the bus shelters, high mast lights, underground cable work of MSEDCL, installation of e-toilets, is still remaining. The NMSCDCL will ensure that these works are completed within the next one month,” Kunte said.

A visit to the road on Monday revealed that the traffic signals at CBS chowk and Mehar junction are yet to be made operational.

Kottayam: A special court for Pocso cases at Thodupuzha in Idukki on Monday rejected the anticipatory bail plea of a Childline activist, who is accused in a crime registered by the Munnar police for the offence of giving false information of sexual assault on a minor boy.

The accused threatened the Class IX student to file a false complaint against a woman counsellor who was acquainted with the boy.

The accused John S Edwin of Ikka Nagar, Munnar, had moved a complaint through the childline to the police.

On preliminary complaint inquiry conducted by the police, it was revealed that it is a false complaint and certain disputes existing between the school teachers added fuel to filing the complaint. Special public prosecutor P B Wahida pointed out that filing false complaint is punishable under Section 22 of Pocso Act.

Justice K Anilkumar, special judge for Pocso cases, rejected the anticipatory bail plea citing that granting bail will give the wrong message to the society as the probe is in progress.

The Punjab wrestler and his aide had cut through an ATM by the time police landed at the kiosk

BENGALURU: A wrestler and his associate from Punjab , who entered an SBI ATM kiosk in southwest Bengaluru early on Sunday and cut open the cash-vending machine, were arrested after blank visuals from the kiosk were noticed by the bank’s control room in Mumbai.

Harsh Aror, 36, a wrestler in Jalandhar, and his associate, Samarjoth Singh, 32, from Sri Muktsar Sahib city, had removed Rs 13 lakh cash from the ATM and stuffed it into a bag, when police arrived and arrested them. The cops were alerted by the bank.

Ramesh Banoth, DCP (west), said the incident took place between 1.20am and 1.50am on Sunday at the SBI kiosk opposite BHEL.

“The two masked CCTV cameras installed outside the ATM with chewing gum. After entering the ATM, the miscreants, who wore helmets, blackened the cameras inside. But SBI’s control room staff in Mumbai noticed the visuals going blank and suspected something amiss. Officials alerted the Bengaluru police control room, but we were not told which kiosk had been targeted. We asked night patrol cops to verify all SBI ATMs from JJ Nagar till Rajarajeshwari Nagar,” Banoth said.

Chandra Layout inspector Brijesh Mathew, who was on night patrol, and three Hoysala staffers zeroed in on the kiosk near BHEL. “Our men found its shutter rolled down and could smell something burning,” Banoth said.

The duo inside the kiosk, however, put up a fight. According to Brijesh’s complaint, they hit head constables Basavaraj and Anand with an iron rod on the leg and hand, respectively.

“We nabbed the duo red-handed and seized the stolen money, a gas cutter, cylinder, oxygen masks, pipes, a car and other material from them,” Banoth said.

Duo were fourth-time unlucky in robbery

Harsh Aror and Samarjoth Singh had planned to loot ATMs to clear the debts they had incurred after suffering loss in their cloth business. Aror and Singh were staying in BTM Layout, southeast Bengaluru. for six months. They failed to loot ATMs in their first two attempts but succeeded the third time and took away Rs 23.5 lakh from a kiosk at Parappana Agrahara on the night of December 28.

They learnt tricks from online videos

“They initially watched videos about looting ATMs on online platforms, including YouTube. They realised a gas cutter would help them open the metal kiosks,” an investigating officer said. The suspects were produced before the court, which remanded them in police custody for 14 days. Police said Harsh was a wrestler and car driver, while Samarjoth ran an apparel business, in which he lost huge sums of money.

Madurai: Bad roads, uneven pedestrian paths and damaged or encroached pavements are what residents witness every day leaving all sorts of mobility at risk in the city.

Encroachment of the pavements in the four Masi Streets around Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple makes it extremely difficult for the commuters. “The vendors pick up a quarrel if we walk in front of their roadside shop, or stand in front of them. They try to make it look as though we are violating the rules,” said K Kannan of Chinthamani.

It is not just one part of the city that is facing this problem but almost all the roads. In West Veli Street near the Madurai railway junction, vehicles are parked on the pavement, forcing people to walk on the road amidst fast moving traffic where vehicles tend to rub against the pedestrians as the centre median has narrowed the road, said S Shanthi, a commuter.

Window shopping is a strict no in Anna Nagar, a dream destination for shoppers where many shops like textiles, ice cream, sweets, shoes, and jewellery dot the surroundings. “However, one cannot walk without watching every step as the pavement is full of gaping holes, into which a child could fall,” said Thangaraj, a shopkeeper. “A paver block pedestrian path could do wonders to the business in Anna Nagar, but the corporation has not been paying attention in spite of representations to repair the pavement,” he said.

Kamarajar Salai, which has shops on both sides, also sees vehicles being parked haphazardly. The problem becomes worse when marriage halls are booked as cars are parked for nearly a km. Pavements on this stretch are also unusable.

City engineer S Arasu said that the repair works of the pavements would be taken when the roads are re-laid for which funds have been sanctioned. Encroachments are also being removed by the authorities regularly, he added.

290,['28/01/2020'],Panel to decide on Smart City consultant’s penalty,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Nashik: The directorial board of the Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation (NMSCDCL) on Monday expressed concerns over the poor consultancy services provided by Project Management Consultant (PMC). The board set up a committee to decide whether to levy a penalty on the consultant and reduce its consultancy fees.

The committee includes municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game and Uddhav Nimse, the chairman of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) standing committee.

The Smart City administration had tabled a proposal in this connection at the board meeting of the NMSCDCL. “We have reported our disappointment for the inefficient staff provided for the Smart City projects by PMC. The total consultancy charges for the projects amount to Rs 31 crore, and the NMSCDCL has paid Rs 5 crore so far,” said NMSCDCL chairman Sitaram Kunte.

“The PMC did not prepare proper estimates for the Smart City projects and we had to make frequent changes due to its inexperienced staff. Therefore, there is an issue over making payment to PMC. We have set up a committee that will decide on whether to reduce its consultancy fees,” said Kunte. “PMC is a well-known consultant, but it did not provide qualified staff. We have told the company to provide experienced and qualified staff,” he added.

A PMC had been appointed to support NMSCDCL in developing, planning, designing, managing, implementing and monitoring the Smart City proposals/projects. However, the quality of work, quantity and timeliness of services were not to a satisfactory level.

Representative image

PUNE: Owners of 82,000 properties have applied for and benefited from the PMC ’s property tax discount of 5% and 10% if their building, society or bungalow has a compost pit, rain water harvesting or solar powered systems. The civic body now wants to increase the number of beneficiaries up to two lakh.

The PMC now also offers a subsidy to citizens and housing societies if they buy composting or waste processing machines for disposal of wet waste instead of compost pits.

A subsidy is given for promoting segregation at source. Individual citizens and housing societies can avail the subsidy. Citizens can get financial aid up to Rs 1,200 per house, while societies can get up to Rs 1.2 lakh.

The funds are to be used for setting up a processing plant. The two-bucket vermi-compost unit can be installed on private properties especially in flats, while the electrical composting machines can be used by housing societies.

The civic body will empanel traders to sell the garbage processing units . The traders have to demonstrate their machines and provide training about their usage and maintenance to the buyers. An exhibition of these options was organised at Ganesh Kala Krida Manch on Saturday and Sunday .

“Those who have availed the subsidy will have to ensure that they keep their units maintained and use them. These units will be monitored by a team,” Dnyaneshwar Molak, head of PMC’s solid waste management department, said.

More and more people can set up the processing units on their properties. Smaller and old housing societies will benefit from the move for 100% disposal at source and improve Pune’s Swachh ranking for the cleanest city.

Hyderabad: Eyeing urban local bodies where TRS did not perform well, the pink party is reportedly wooing independents as they have become decisive factor in getting mayor and chairpersons posts.

TRS working president and MA&UD minister KT Rama Rao has asked local leadership to talk to independents to bring them into party fold. On Saturday evening, two independents had joined TRS in Khammam district. In Kollapur and Ieeja municipality, TRS rebels, who won on All India Forward Bloc tickets, reportedly expressed their willingness to join TRS.

Party leaders said the TRS working president has begun the exercise of selection of chairpersons, mayors and deputy chairpersons and mayors on Saturday evening and continued on Sunday morning by talking to the ministers and MLAs. Sources said the incharges of the respective civic bodies have been asked to give names and preferences for the posts. TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao might take a decision on the names on Sunday night and communicate them to the ministers and MLAs by Monday morning.

Indirect elections to posts of chairpersons, mayors and deputy mayors would be held on Monday morning. The Telangana State Election Commission can issue whip to the elected corporators to prevent defections. “TRS will be in power for the next four years and they can serve to the people in the party. Ninety per cent of independents have come forward to support TRS,” TRS leaders claimed. The ex officio members of the civic bodies MPs, MLAs and MLCs have already given their preferences like at Meerpet corporation, where the party requires more number.

In the election of chairpersons and mayors, social composition is also likely to be taken into consideration and also other factors like leaders who are loyal to the party and participated in the movement.

As there was a chance of illegal practices in election of mayor and chairpersons posts, Telangana State Election Commission said bribery, exertion of undue influence on the elected representatives (ward members) and camps were seriously and also it was in violation of the Model Code of Conduct.

“No political party or candidate shall offer any post to the electors as an incentive or bribe for defying their party whip while exercising their voting rights. They candidates or party shall not organize any camps with elected members either directly or indirectly,” SEC commission V Nagi Reddy said.

“Bribery or influencing ward members in the indirect elections are punishable under Section 234 of the Telangana Panchayat Raj Act and Section 226 of the Municipalities Act and the responsible persons would be prosecuted,” Nagi Reddy said.

Jeddah: Ministry of labour has ordered to localize jobs in the online taxi sector to Saudi citizens, banning employment of foreign workers. Online taxis, introduced two years ago, are very popular. Thousands of Malayalis work in this sector.

For many Malayalis, it’s an additional source of income. They work during evening hours as part-time job after finishing routine work. Uber, Kareem and Easy taxis are available options. Suneer from Kayamkulam in Alappuza, a Kareem driver said that it was a good source of income. On an average, he used to earn Rs 38,080 (SR 2,000) monthly by doing this as part-time job. Like Suneer, many expats with cars do the same job to earn extra money.

Commuters prefer to hire online taxis as the entire service is controlled by gadgets. Passengers need not bother about route or destination. Khaled Abu Al-Khail, spokesman from ministry of labour and social development, confirmed the decision regarding limiting work in online taxi cars to Saudi nationals. He said joint inspection teams will monitor online car companies for any violations. Fines will be imposed on violating firms depending on the number of expat workers employed in jobs restricted to Saudis.

Meanwhile, Saudi authorities decided to make regular taxis to go green. The colour change began at King Abdulaziz International Airport as an experiment. Very soon all online taxis will go green. Private cars cannot run as online taxis official sources said.

294,['28/01/2020'],PMC draft budget takes up traffic challenge,"File photo of huge traffic jam in Pune

Activists not on the same page

PUNE: Municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad has plans to find some method in the traffic madness.On Monday, along with the proposal to streamline traffic in the city, he also announced a review of the Bus Rapid Transit System project, dedicated lanes for two-wheelers and introduction of solar or electric vehicles in the congested areas.While presenting the draft civic budget, Gaikwad said streamlining traffic in the city was his top priority to ensure a hassle-free commute.“The city has more than 36 lakh registered vehicles of which 80% are motorcycles. A proper plan to deal with movement of two-wheelers is necessary,” he said.The civic chief said he was looking forward to solutions, which would enable the two-wheeler riders to traverse the entire city in 35-40 minutes. “It is a challenging task, but a solution needs to be worked out to avoid hassles in the future. Like freeways for cars in Mumbai, we can have dedicated lanes for two-wheelers to ensure faster movement,” Gaikwad said, while speaking with the media after tabling the draft civic budget.He said the existing BRTS corridors were only meant for buses, but could also be utilized for movement of two-wheelers.“At some stretches, especially in the congested areas, BRTS lanes can be opened for two-wheelers. On lanes where the frequency of buses is less, the corridor can be opened for two-wheelers as it remains vacant for a longer period. However, before implementing the scheme, we will conduct a detailed study and also seek the help of organizations. All the stakeholders will be consulted before any decision,” Gaikwad said.Gaikwad said smaller solar-operated and electric vehicles in the congested areas were needed. PMPML vehicles face problems to operate in such areas and smaller e-vehicles or those operated on solar energy can be introduced on such routes for the benefit of the people, he said, adding that the initiative can be rolled out with the help of the industries under their corporate social responsibility initiatives.Gaikwad said there was a need to reset traffic movement on narrow lanes by introducing one-ways for barrier-free movement. “Also, development of parking lots in the government-owned plots to minimise roadside parking is an option,” he said.The civic chief also expressed the need to prepare a comprehensive plan for extension of Metro services, while considering the requirements of the next 50 years. “Factors like inclusion of new villages in the city limits, development of new industrial areas, IT hubs and proposed airport have to be considered while coming up with the Metro plan,” he added.On the opening of BRTS lanes to two-wheelers, activists said the civic authorities should first execute the BRTS project properly. “PMC has failed to execute the BRTS project, which is the reason for the prevailing chaos. BRTS should primarily handle public transport buses. Introduction of private vehicles, including bikes, will defeat the very purpose of introducing the dedicated lanes of BRTS. The bikes or private vehicles can be allowed only in exceptional cases,” an activist from the Satara Road area said on condition of anonymity.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73687999,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-284726,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-draft-budget-takes-up-traffic-challenge/articleshow/73676879.cms
295,['28/01/2020'],NMC to clean 3 Godavari tributaries using robotic tech,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has decided to clean three tributaries of the Godavari river — Waldevi, Nandini and Waghadi — on its own using robotic technology.

Earlier, the civic body had planned to clean these three rivers manually through private contractors. The NMC had also floated tenders for the purpose. However, it did not receive a good response from contractors.

Following demand from civic body office-bearers, the NMC has decided to clean the rivers on its own. In fact, it has already started the cleaning process using a robotic machine in three tributaries.

Water hyacinth, sewage, moss and plastic waste have been causing obstacles to the free flow of water in Nandini, Waghadi and Waldevi. The obstructions also make the water stagnant in many places. Stagnant water is neither good for the health of the river nor for people. In addition, a lot of pollution is being caused by local residents living by the rivers.

“Earlier, we had plans to rope in private contractors or agencies to clean the rivers by removing water hyacinth, plastics, garbage and other waste from the waterbodies. We had invited bids to clean the three tributaries of the Godavari, but did not receive a good response,” said the NMC officials.

“We had then invited bid for the second time, but we received bids from only two-three contractors. Even they did not qualify. We had plans to float fresh bid again,” they added.

However, there are limitations to cleaning rivers manually. Therefore, the civic body has decided to clean the Godavari’s tributaries on its own. The NMC has a robotic machine and the manpower is to be provided by the robotic company concerned, said the municipal officials.

“In fact, we have already started cleaning the three tributaries on our own,” said officials. The robotic cleaning operations will also be faster than the manual method.

296,['28/01/2020'],PMC draft budget seeks 12% hike in property tax,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Representative image

PUNE: A 12% hike in property tax proposed by municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad in the draft civic budget for 2020-2021 is expected to bring an additional income of Rs 150 crore.

Gaikwad tabled a Rs 6,229-crore budget for the next fiscal before the standing committee on Monday, an increase of Rs 144 crore from last year's Rs 6,085 crore.

The proposed increase includes a 5.5% hike in general tax, 1.5% in water benefit tax and 5% in sewage treatment charges. The budget has to be approved by the standing committee and the general body before its implementation.

Citizens will also have to pay an additional 15% in water tax which has already been approved as a part of 24X7 water supply project.

Gaikwad said steps have been planned to increase tax collection to boost the civic body's income. “The civic administration may start revenue generation by imposing tax on properties which are not in the ambit. They include properties which were in the gram panchayat limits but are now part of the PMC, and the newly constructed buildings in such areas,” he said.

He said many properties under the PMC have got occupancy certificates but have not been added in the tax net. A special drive to identify and include these properties will follow, he added.

“We will cross verify the OCs issued in the last few months and their property tax status. The civic body will make sure that each and every property with OC is registered with the property tax department and the owner pays tax,” Gaikwad added.

The stumbling block may be the standing committee which may reject the tax hike as it has done in the past. The civic panel gives the final touches to the budget and presents it.

“The hike is not justifiable and I want to reject it. The civic administration has to ensure that the tax dues are recovered. All the senior leaders in the PMC will take a final call, but the hike is very likely to be rejected,” standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne said.

The panel had rejected the 12% property tax hike proposed in the 2019-20 budget by then commissioner Saurabh Rao. The civic administration was expecting an additional tax revenue of Rs 110 crore from such a hike that was applicable to residential properties, cellphone tower companies, IT and ITES companies.

Civic activists said the hike was unfair to those paying tax regularly. “Recovery of around Rs 3,500 crore is pending. The civic administration should not increase property tax until they recover such dues,” Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch, a citizens’ group, said.

MADURAI: Two people were killed in a clash between two groups at Kailasapatti near Periyakulam in Theni district on Monday prompting relatives of one of the victims to block the road with his body disrupting traffic on the Theni - Dindigul highway. Police said that members of a particular community had lodged a complaint with the Thenkarai police against the activities of a man from another community, a ganja peddler, at Kailasapatti near Periyakulam about two months ago. The ganja peddler and his relatives attacked members of the other community on coming to know about the complaint leading to tension in the village. Subsequently, another complaint was filed by the affected people with the police demanding that the police take action against the man selling ganja. Tension prevailed in the village and there were frequent quarrels between the two groups since then.

On Tuesday evening, a clash erupted and seven people including a woman were attacked with deadly weapons by the other group. Jayabal who was injured died at Theni government hospital. Perumal, 70 from the other community who sustained grievous injuries died a little later. Jayabal’s relatives staged a protest on the road with his body. Theni district superintendent of police E Sai Charan Tejaswi and other officials visited the village and a large number of policemen have been posted there.tnn

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: A suspended scientist from the Institute of Plasma Research (IPR) has approached the Gujarat high court challenging a departmental chargsheet issued against him last month.

Petitioner Subrata Pradhan is a former head of the Steady State Superconducting Tokomak – 1 Mission, (SST-1). He was instrumental in getting it commissioned and operational in 2013. This was achieved for the first time in India. He was suspended in August 2018 by IPR director, Shashank Chaturvedi. He has been fighting a legal battle in the high court since then.

Pradhan has approached the HC once again through advocate Rahul Sharma and Utkarsh Dave after he was served with a chargesheet last month. He has questioned the validity of the chargesheet on various grounds. He has contended that the chargesheet is without jurisdiction since the mandatory First Stage Advice of the chief vigilance commission (CVC) was not taken.

Pradhan has also claimed that some of the charges mentioned in the chargesheet are required to be looked into by the CVC and not by the department. He has claimed that he has been singled out by the director for decisions that were taken by a committee more than a decade ago. He attributes the alleged malice on part of the director to his own chances of becoming the institute’s director in 2015.

Besides quashing of the chargesheet, Pradhan has also urged the HC to direct the government to consider his request for increasing his subsistence allowance to 75% in accordance with law.

The HC is likely to hear Pradhan’s plea in the coming days.

Pradhan’s petition challenging his suspension is pending in the HC. He claimed in the petition that he was suspended without being given an opportunity to respond to accusations or irregularities levelled against him.

The scientist has been contending that as soon as Chaturvedi became IPR director in 2016, he began harassing him and narrated the series of events that ultimately led to his suspension and filing of chargesheet.

AHMEDABAD: Pull out your helmets as the state government took a U-turn over its “temporary relaxation” of the mandatory helmets rule, and told the Gujarat high court on Monday that it had not issued any notification relaxing the rule regarding safety headgear for two-wheeler riders.Not only did the government assert that it had not relaxed the compulsory helmets rule, its advocate pointed out that in 2015, it amended the state rules and made helmets mandatory for pillion riders as well.The state government made this clarification after the much touted announcement by the state cabinet on December 5, that the mandatory helmets rule was “temporarily” relaxed in municipal areas. The bench headed by Chief Justice Vikram Nath asked for an affidavit from the transport department in this regard from by the end of the month.The government’s claim that there was no relaxation on paper came in response to a PIL filed by one Sanjeev Ezhava from Surat, who complained that making helmets temporarily optional for two-wheeler riders in municipal areas was a violation of Section 129 of the recently amended central Motor Vehicles Act. Ezhava claimed that Gujarat government’s decision to relax this rule was a negligent omission.The PIL submitted that the state government had earlier made pillion riders in women and children the exception to mandatory helmet rule , which was also against provisions of the MV Act.The petitioner cited a press note published on the Gujarat government website, as well as a circular issued on December 5, 2019 by the transport commissioner to all RTOs and assistant RTOs, asking them to grant exemption to two-wheeler riders in municipal areas from the mandatory helmet rule.In response to the petitioner’s claim of exempting women and children form wearing helmets while riding pillion, the government cited its 2015 amendment, by which it made helmets mandatory for them.The petitioner argued that the central government law in August 2019 went a step ahead to protect the lives of riders, and any move to make wearing helmets optional was a regressive step. He cited figures of two-wheeler riders killed in road accidents. In 2017, 35,975 people died in the country and the deaths witnessed a 9.1% rise in 2018, with 43,614 deaths reported.Ezhava further submitted that in Gujarat, 209 persons riding two-wheelers were killed in accidents in 2016 and 1,546 people were killed in 2018. The number was even higher in 2017, with 1,912 deaths. Gujarat is eleventh in the country in the number of road deaths of two-wheeler riders.Ezhava also cited the high court’s directions in a suo motu PIL to the state government, to make helmets mandatory for two-wheeler riders in 2005-06.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73683910,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-222591,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-makes-u-turn-on-helmets-tells-hc-it-hasnt-relaxed-the-rule/articleshow/73676913.cms

Pune: Municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad on Monday proposed a review of the civic body’s existing schemes to check their necessity and efficacy.

Gaikwad said he would immediately initiate steps to start reviewing the schemes. He said, “The schemes that are not useful or effective can be suspended. Besides curbing unnecessary expenses, this will also help administration introduce new schemes that are more effective.”

The municipal commissioner said he was not in position to provide details of every scheme since he recently took charge of the office.

“The review will be comprehensive in nature. I also appeal to the elected representatives to come forward with suggestions on the review and implementation of the schemes. A joint study by the administration and corporators will help eliminate lapses and achieve a realistic outcome,” Gaikwad said, adding that no scheme would be suspended without prior review.

The civic chief said he was in favour of a supplementary budget from the next financial year. Gaikwad said, “The concept is being implemented at the state level, where the elected representatives submit their demands or revised estimates. A similar concept can be introduced at the civic body.”

He added, “The elected representatives can submit proposals for diversion of funds under the supplementary budget. Currently, all such proposals are tabled throughout the year which poses a challenge for the administration.”

The civic chief said the supplementary budget exercise could be executed in December-January. “It is an ideal period because the administration by the time gets a fair idea about revenue collection and also about spending of allocated budget for projects,” Gaikwad said.

NEW DELHI: Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal , while addressing a traders’ conclave in Delhi on Monday, suggested the idea of a national register for traders that would have a database of the merchants, their families and workers “You say there are seven crore traders and many families are associated with you as workers. It is my suggestion that there should be an accurate database of names, family members, workers, type of trade, locations and mobile numbers. It is unfortunate that while a (national) population register is being considered, people are carrying out mischievous propaganda against it,” Goyal said.At the Dilli Vyapari Mahasammelan organised by Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), Goyal argued that for any welfare scheme to be effective, the government should have accurate data. “We wanted to bring an amnesty scheme for pending cases of traders and industrialists, but we needed data to gauge its effectiveness. It would have shown us how much revenue we would have to forego,” he added.The minister said that the national database would benefit both the trading sector, by giving them more power, and the government, by effective policymaking. “Every forum throws different numbers. Every sector, be it the mobile industry, retail trade, grain trade, etc, claims to have a large number of people associated with it. Sometimes, the overall number becomes more than the entire population of the country,” Goyal added.Goyal clarified that his remarks were non-political. “You have taken permission from Election Commission for this conclave by stating that it is a non-political forum. So, I will say things within my maryada (dignity). I am not here as a politician seeking votes. The government wants to work on improving financing and digitisation,” he added.While the Delhi assembly polls have seen a lot of debate over freebies, Goyal said he doesn’t believe in subsidies. “This government doesn’t give subsidies on one hand and cause injury on the other. We believe in structural reforms,” he added, while giving the example of the LED bulbs programme to support his argument.“Before 2014, a government company used to purchase 6 lakh LED bulbs in a year. After subsidy, the bulb was sold for Rs 400-500. Subsidy was limiting the capacity. The subsidy and the problems highlighted by the industry were removed. Against the target of 70 crore bulbs, we sold more than 150 crore and the price came down to as low as Rs 38,” Goyal said.CAIT general secretary Praveen Khandelwal said they have accepted the minister’s challenge and a database on traders will be created in six months.",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73676948,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-68709,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi-assembly-elections/goyal-calls-for-a-national-register-of-traders-workers/articleshow/73676949.cms

In anticipation of US president Donald Trump’s possible visit to the city for the Motera cricket stadium inauguration, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) is giving 16 stretches of road around the stadium a makeover, as well as laying new alternative routes to the world’s largest cricket stadium.

A senior AMC official denied any intimation about Trump’s visit, “Neither the US or the Union government has confirmed Trump’s visit to the city,” said a senior AMC official.

Some of the main roads that will be widened and resurfaced are Chimanbhai Patel Bridge to Visat junction and Visat to Zundal junction. Another stretch that will be repaired will be between Visat junction and Tapovan Circle. The access road to the Motera stadium from Janpath Hotel will be widened to 24 metres, along with two other parallel roads. Two new roads are be made, from Bhat and Koteshwar to Motera. Most internal roads from residential societies to the ONGC and Motera stadium roads under TP 28 will be spruced up in the current drive, AMC officials claimed.

“We have to get the roads ready ahead of the stadium becoming functional, keeping in mind the traffic jams that the area may witness as 1.10 lakh spectators turn up at the venue,” says municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra.

Civic sources add that a detailed survey of underground lines is also being done simultaneously, to clear blockages or shift lines.

NEW DELHI: Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal , while addressing a traders’ conclave in Delhi on Monday, suggested the idea of a national register for traders that would have a database of the merchants, their families and workers .

“You say there are seven crore traders and many families are associated with you as workers. It is my suggestion that there should be an accurate database of names, family members, workers, type of trade, locations and mobile numbers. It is unfortunate that while a (national) population register is being considered, people are carrying out mischievous propaganda against it,” Goyal said.

Complete Coverage on Delhi Elections

At the Dilli Vyapari Mahasammelan organised by Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), Goyal argued that for any welfare scheme to be effective, the government should have accurate data. “We wanted to bring an amnesty scheme for pending cases of traders and industrialists, but we needed data to gauge its effectiveness. It would have shown us how much revenue we would have to forego,” he added.

The minister said that the national database would benefit both the trading sector, by giving them more power, and the government, by effective policymaking. “Every forum throws different numbers. Every sector, be it the mobile industry, retail trade, grain trade, etc, claims to have a large number of people associated with it. Sometimes, the overall number becomes more than the entire population of the country,” Goyal added.

Goyal clarified that his remarks were non-political. “You have taken permission from Election Commission for this conclave by stating that it is a non-political forum. So, I will say things within my maryada (dignity). I am not here as a politician seeking votes. The government wants to work on improving financing and digitisation,” he added.

While the Delhi assembly polls have seen a lot of debate over freebies, Goyal said he doesn’t believe in subsidies. “This government doesn’t give subsidies on one hand and cause injury on the other. We believe in structural reforms,” he added, while giving the example of the LED bulbs programme to support his argument.

“Before 2014, a government company used to purchase 6 lakh LED bulbs in a year. After subsidy, the bulb was sold for Rs 400-500. Subsidy was limiting the capacity. The subsidy and the problems highlighted by the industry were removed. Against the target of 70 crore bulbs, we sold more than 150 crore and the price came down to as low as Rs 38,” Goyal said.

CAIT general secretary Praveen Khandelwal said they have accepted the minister’s challenge and a database on traders will be created in six months.

305,['28/01/2020'],Explain poll remark: EC to BJP’s Thakur,"This story is from January 28, 2020

New Delhi: The Election Commission on Tuesday asked Union minister of state for finance Anurag Thakur to respond to a complaint over the inflammatory slogan that he allegedly used at an election rally in northwest Delhi’s Rithala on Monday. He has been given time till noon on January 30 to explain his statement.

EC issued the notice to Thakur after the Delhi chief electoral officer submitted a report to the poll panel on the “provocative” language used by the minister. After lashing out at anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protesters the BJP MP had egged on the election rally crowd to raise an incendiary slogan — “shoot the traitors”.

In its notice to Thakur, EC said it prima facie found his slogan had the potential to “disturb communal harmony” and “aggravate the existing differences” between social and religious communities. Referring to sections 123 (3A) and 125 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, the EC said: “You have violated… the provisions of Model Code of Conduct and Representation of the People Act, 1951. The Commission gives you an opportunity to explain your position in making the above said statement on or before noon of 30 January, 2020 (Thursday), failing which the Commission shall take a decision without any further reference to you.”

EC also asked the Delhi CEO to furnish details on the controversial statements made by BJP’s West Delhi MP Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma regarding the protests at Shaheen Bagh.

Earlier on Tuesday, the Delhi CEO issued a press release saying that it had submitted reports to EC on “suspected” violation of Model Code of Conduct by BJP’s star campaigners Thakur and Verma. The office of the CEO took suo motu cognisance of the two men’s statements.

Aam Aadmi Party and Congress also complained to EC against the two BJP leaders. The former complained that Thakur’s speech was a “blatant violation of the model code of conduct” and sought an FIR against the central minister. Delhi Congress urged EC to ban Thakur and Verma for making “provocative statements to incite communal violence” in the campaign for the assembly elections.

Ajay Maken, senior Congress functionary, said, “BJP’s star campaigners Parvesh Verma and Anurag Thakur have used objectionable language. Top BJP leaders, including home minister Amit Shah, are making provocative statements in Delhi’s lanes and bylanes to polarise people and incite communal violence. The BJP is doing this out of frustration.”

Sangareddy MLA T Jayaprakash Reddy

HYDERABAD: Sangareddy MLA T Jayaprakash Reddy on Sunday said he was unable to understand why people were voting for TRS in election after election despite the ruling party not fulfilling a substantial number of promises made by it.

“We need to study the reasons behind people voting in favour of TRS. One of the factors that worked in favour of TRS is its distribution of money and liquor, but this alone would not be enough to win over 100 urban local bodies,” the Congress MLA said.

Stating that the resolve of Congress gets strengthened with every election, he said the grand old party would work hard to come to power in the 2023 Assembly elections. “The Congress has given a tough contest to TRS in a large number of ULBs. TRS won with small margins in many municipalities,” he added.

Jayaprakash Reddy popularly known as Jagga Reddy, congratulated municipal minister KT Rama Rao for leading TRS to huge victory in the municipal polls and lauded finance minister T Harish Rao for winning both municipalities in Sangareddy, an Assembly constituency represented by him.

HYDERABAD: Khammam, once the stronghold of CPI, CPM, Congress and TDP, has gone to the TRS this time. Firming up its hold over entire Telangana , the ruling party has won all the five municipalities in Khammam and Bhadradri-Kothagudem districts.

While BJP has no representation in the five urban local bodies of the two districts, the TRS has decimated the Congress, TDP and Left in Khammam. In 2014 municipal polls, TRS could barely manage to win only 4 wards in urban local bodies of Khammam and Bhadradri-Kothagudem, but, this year, it won 94 wards in all in the five municipalities.

In Kothagudem municipality of Bhadradri-Kothagudem distict, TRS won 25 of the total 36 wards, followed by CPI (8 wards), two independents and a single ward won by Congress. In 2014 municipal polls, TRS had managed to win just one ward in Kothagudem municipality with Congress leading with 12 wards, followed by CPI 8 wards, TDP 4, YSRCP 1 and independents 6. This year, TDP has failed to win a single ward in Kothagudem.

The TRS also swept the polls in Yellandu municipality by winning 19 of the total 24 wards. The Congress failed to win a single ward, while CPI managed to win one and independents 4 seats. In 2014 polls, TRS had won just 3 wards in Yellandu with Congress 8 and CPI 3, among others.

In Khammam district , TRS made a clean sweep by winning all the 23 wards in Sathupalli municipality, including an independent supported by the party. In 2014 polls, TRS had failed to open its account in Sathupalli.

The victory margins have been huge for TRS in the remaining two municipalities of Khammam district. TRS candidates romped home in Madhira ULB, which falls under Madhira assembly constituency represented by Congress leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka. In 2014, TRS had failed to win even a single ward in Madhira. In Wyra too, TRS won 15 out of the total 20 wards. The CPM managed to win one ward each in Madhira and Wyra.

A hospital source said the boy who lost his arm suffered a lot of blood loss and was critical

MADURAI: A boy’s arm had to be amputated while 18 other students and the driver escaped with minor injuries after a school bus skidded off the road and fell into the bushes at Poonjuthi village in Melur on Monday. Police blamed the driver’s negligence for the accident.

According to them, the school bus belonging to a private school in Sivaganga district was picking up students including those from Poonjuthi village in the morning. The accident occurred when the bus driver bent to pick up a fallen packet of curd and tried to throw it out. He lost control of the vehicle in the process leading to the accident.

Veerapandi R, a Class III student, lost his left arm in the accident while the others sustained minor injuries. The students were being treated at the closest government hospital and private hospitals in Melur and Madurai city. Hospital authorities said Veerapandi’s condition is critical. “We had to amputate his left arm. The boy also suffered a lot of blood loss. He has to be monitored closely for the next 24 hours,” they said.

Melur police registered a case against the driver under sections 279, 337 and 338 of IPC dealing with rash driving and endangering lives of others. Probe is on and the accused is yet to be arrested. “There was no other factor involved. The accident could have been avoided had the driver been careful and stopped the bus before trying to pick up the curd packet and disposing it,” police added.

309,['28/01/2020'],Two-finger test for rape survivors unconstitutional: Gujarat high court,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Gujarat high court

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has held that the two-finger test to check the virginity of rape victims is unconstitutional. It directed the trial courts and doctors to bear this in mind because “it violates the right of the victim of sexual assault to privacy, physical and mental integrity and dignity”.

The HC observed so on the aspect of consent by rape survivor in a “unique appeal” filed by the state government. The HC convicted one Rameshchandra Panchal from Kadi town for rape nearly 25 years after he was exonerated by a trial court “by mistake” in 1995. The victim was a minor, but the court by mistake counted that she was above 16 and recorded Panchal’s acquittal on the basis that the sexual relations between Panchal and the victim were with her consent. Panchal, however, was punished with a seven-year jail term for abduction of the girl under sections 363 and 366 of IPC.

However, after recording the acquittal, the sessions court at Mirzapur rural court campus realized that the victim was below 16 years, and a minor, and her consent was immaterial and the offence amounted to statutory rape. Since the trial court had recorded its verdict, it could not review its own order. The HC corrected the mistake 25 years later in response to an appeal filed by the state government. The HC declared Panchal guilty of rape and ordered him taken into custody. The court has summoned him on December 31, when it is likely to sentence him for rape.

The ‘two-finger test’ also known as the PV (Per Vaginal) refers to an intrusive physical examination of a woman’s vagina to figure out the laxity of vaginal muscles and whether the hymen is distensible or not.

Calling upon courts and doctors to do away with the “archaic and outdated” practice, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice B D Karia cited various orders by the Supreme Court and recommendations by the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights 1966, a UN declaration in 1985 and planning commission’s orders and recommendations to this effect that medical procedures should not be carried out in a manner that constitutes cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment for victims of gender-based violence.

The HC said that the Indian Evidence Act does not permit character assassination of a witness and two-finger test is also “one of the most unscientific methods of examination used in the context of sexual assault and has not forensic value”.

The court further said that since the apex court is considering the issue of ‘two-finger test’, “Our endeavour is to remind the trial courts as well as the medical fraternity that the ‘two-finger test’ is unconstitutional, as it violates the right of the victim of sexual assault to privacy, physical and mental integrity and dignity. If the trial court comes across any such medical certificate, wherein, there is a reference of such test, then it should take cognizance of the same and do the needful in the matter.”

BAREILLY: Two drug peddlers were arrested with 15kg opium worth several lakhs of rupee in the international market on Monday, said police.

This is the third incident of drug peddling reported this month in Bareilly . Earlier, police had arrested three drug peddlers and seized 4.9kg opium from their possession.

Police said after receiving a tip-off that a white car coming from Alampur Gajraula will be carrying opium stashed in two sacks, a police team erected a barricade on the road in Bithri Chainpur area and started checking suspected vehicles.

“We have been waiting for the white car at the barricade, but when the accused saw police, they tried to escape, but we waylaid the car. When asked to come out of their vehicle, the accused again tried to flee the spot, but police thwarted their attempt,” said police.

The accused identified themselves as Tahir and Rashid, both native of Urala village under Bithri Chainpur police station, said police.

Station house officer of Bithri Chainpur police station Ashok Kumar Singh said, “During interrogation, the accused told police that they are mainly gamblers, but peddle drugs only when they need some extra money. We seized 15kg opium from their possession, which would be to the tunes of several lakhs of rupees. We are, however, yet to ascertain its actual price in the international market.”

Apart from opium, said the SHO, police also seized three mobile phones and seven ATM cards from their possession and impounded the car. An FIR was registered and the accused were sent to jail, said the SHO.

According to data available with police, 141 drug peddlers were booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act in Bareilly in 2017. The number, however, increased to 237 in 2018 and 252 in 2019.

On January 3, the Special Task Force (STF) arrested two inter-state drug peddlers in Bareilly and seized 4kg opium worth Rs 40 lakh from their possession. According to STF officials, the accused had come to Bareilly with a consignment of opium from Jharkhand. The accused had tied opium around their legs and were travelling in air-conditioned coaches of a train to dodge police. They had bought opium in Jharkhand at a price of Rs 60,000 and were supplying in Bareilly for Rs 1 lakh.

Similarly, a drug peddler was arrested in Quila area on January 2 with 900gm opium worth Rs 6 lakh.

PUNE: Special UAPA judge S R Navander on Monday posted for February 3 an order on a joint application of the nine arrested accused in the Elgar Parishad case raising doubts over the veracity of cloned copies of the seized e-data provided to them by the state.The copies are crucial for the accused to prepare their defence in the case that largely rests on the e-data seized by the police. The case is at the stage of framing of charges.The accused have questioned if the hash values of the copies provided to them were matching with that of the original data at the time of seizure of their electronic devices. They insisted that there was no clarity yet either from the police, the prosecution or the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) over how the hash values were matched.The Pune police’s investigating officer, ACP Shivaji Pawar, told the court that the cloned copies given to the accused had been prepared by the FSL experts from the seized original hard disks just like the copies were provided to the police for investigation. He said the original hard disks continue to be with the FSL authorities. Pawar said the hash values of original hard disks had been mentioned in the chargesheets.Pawar sought to clarify the argument by the accused that the police had claimed in their earlier remand reports of having retrieved 25 terabyte (1 TB = 1,000 gegabyte) of data from seized e-devices, but the actual data given to them was far less. He told the court that the earlier reports made only an “estimate” and never claimed an actual figure as the data analysis was then in progress before the FSL. He insisted that all copies provided to the accused had been made by the FSL from the original hard disks.Special prosecutor Ujjwala Pawar explained the procedure followed by the police before the copies were given to the accused. She submitted that the entire search and seizure operations on the premises of the accused were videographed and panchanamas of seizures was drawn. The seized e-devices were immediately sent to the FSL, which made their cloned copies from the originals and gave the copies to the police for investigation. The investigating officer then sent a detailed questionnaire to the FSL seeking information on when the files were created, who were the owners of these files and the date and time of last access, among other details, she submitted.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73693588,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-346588,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/order-on-verification-of-seized-e-data-on-feb-3/articleshow/73676910.cms

314,['28/01/2020'],Onion prices crash by 35% at Lasalgaon,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Nashik: The average wholesale price of onions dropped by 35% to Rs 2,300 per quintal due to an increase in the supply of kharif variety at the Lasalgaon APMC on Monday.

The average price was recorded at Rs 3,500 per quintal at the AMPC, the country’s largest wholesale onion market, on Friday.

An APMC official said the Lasalgaon market has been witnessing price fluctuation for the last two months. “Only a week ago, the average wholesale price had shot up by Rs 950 per quintal to Rs 4,400 per quintal. The price trend, however, reversed last week and the wholesale price has crashed to Rs 2,300 now.”

The average wholesale onion price had recorded an all-time high of Rs 8,625 per quintal at Lasalgaon on December 16 last year. However, it dropped to Rs 4,500 per quintal in the next 15 days.

“Markets are witnessing an increase in supply of fresh produce. Hence, the price trend in wholesale markets will be downward,” the APMC official said.

In the retail market, good quality onions are being sold in the price range between Rs 40 and Rs 50 per kg. But the crash in in average wholesale price is likely to reflect in retail markets in a couple of days and the price is expected to come down to around Rs 30-35 per kg.

Around 20,000 quintal of onions was auctioned at Lasalgaon on Monday, and the minimum and maximum prices were recorded at Rs 1,000 and Rs 2,751 per quintal.

“Usually, the arrival of fresh kharif onions begins by mid-October, but unseasonal rainfall badly affected the kharif crop across Maharashtra. Around 75% of the onion plantation was damaged due to the rain, leading to scarcity and price rise,” the official said.

“However, at around 45,000 hectare, the acreage of late kharif onions has increased in the district. The harvest of late kharif crop has increased in the past three weeks, leading to drop in prices,” added the official.

Jaipur: The district and session court on Monday quashed the order of lodging FIR against BJP leader Rajendra Rathore and others including the police officers in connection to the Dara Singh encounter case.

The court sets aside previous order of metropolitan magistrate court which had ordered to lodge an FIR against Rathore and others .

Metropolitan Magistrate no 17 had ordered an FIR at Bani Park police station on January 7 after a legal complaint through Istegasa was filed by Dara Singh's son Amit Kumar Beniwal. The complaint named BJP leader Rajendra Rathore, Jat Samaj leader Rajaram Meal, Sher Singh Poonia and accused police officers. Some lawyers and Sushila Devi, the wife of Dara Singh were also been implicated for turning hostile.

On the other hand, advocate Roshan Singh, one of the accused in the case, filed a re-inspection petition, saying that the complainant Amit Kumar had cheated the court by concealing important information

Accepting the revision filed by Singh the district and session judge held that the lower court did not examine the complaint properly and ordered to lodge an FIR. “The complainant cleverly concealed name of district judges in the heading of the complaint, but levelled allegations against them in the body of the complaint copy,” said Ajay Kumar Jain, counsel for the petitioner in the court.

Advocate AK Jain argued that the complaint was filed with oblique motive to extort money.

“All employees are also being given awareness and training programs in fire safety by the fire department,” Dr Sangumani told TOI. Notably, a minor fire broke out last year in September at the plastic surgery department in GRH reportedly due to a live beedi left behind by someone.

Hospital sources said that several of the old structures at GRH are not being maintained properly as many of them are leaking and developed cracks. However, there is no specific threat that could result in a fire.

“Though maintenance has been poor, electric circuit boards and wiring, which is capable of causing fire, have all been replaced. Previously, we had aluminium wiring but now they have all been replaced with copper wiring,” said a hospital staff. Dr Sangumani further said that the few old structures at GRH, which have been left unused, are also going to be demolished soon. “Around 5% of the old structures are currently not in use but soon, they will all be demolished for the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) project, which plans to set up a seven-storey building on the GRH main campus near Goripalayam junction,” he said.

One of the concerns raised by some of the patients’ attenders and hospital staff was the dumping of garbage in the bins near the mortuary. “A huge amount of waste, including plastic, paper, dust and dead plants are being dumped inside and outside the bins kept there. A live match stick or a cigarette or beedi can set off fire,” said a staff.

AHMEDABAD: A vegetable vendor from Ganeshnagar saw his wife die of the burns she had suffered after falling on a heap of hot sand a year and a half ago. He rounds of several government offices to learn more about her mysterious death. As he did not get justice, he turned crusader and began helping victims who suffered burns in similar circumstances. Nizamuddin Ansari , 52, who travels 30km a day selling vegetables to make a living, said that he now monitors the Ganeshnagar area to know if anyone is dumping chemical waste there.“Some four months ago, two girls, 9 and 10, suffered burns when they went to defecate in an open area. Their parents were so scared by the incident that they had left and returned to their native place in Uttar Pradesh,” said Ansari who also helped Parvati Sarkar , 35, a resident of Ganeshnagar, who suffered similar burns on Monday morning, get medical help.Ansari’s wife, Salmabano , died on July 17, 2018, after she fell on a the mysterious heap of sand while riding pillion with Ansari on June 22, 2018. They were on their way to Narol when he had lost control of his scooter while trying to avoid colliding with a truck.She fell on to the heap of sand. Moments later, she started screaming in pain.

319,['28/01/2020'],"Battle down south: Old guards, new allegiances &amp; a fresh face","Narayan Dutt Sharma is the sitting MLA from Badarpur

NEW DELHI: Badarpur, the largest assembly constituency in south Delhi in terms of the number of voters, has seen many a twist and turn ever since the parties started declaring their candidates.While AAP was the first to announce its candidate, the decision to replace sitting MLA Narayan Dutt Sharma (47) with Ram Singh Netaji (64), who had only recently switched over from Congress, didn’t go down well with the former. Netaji has previously won the seat twice, first as an independent in 2003 and, then, as a Bahujan Samaj Party candidate in 2008. In 2013 and 2015, he contested on a Congress ticket, but lost on both occasions.Snubbed, Sharma went on an all-out attack, claiming that AAP had sold the ticket to Netaji. A few days later, he joined BSP and was promptly given a ticket.BJP, on the other hand, has kept its faith in veteran Ramvir Singh Bidhuri (66), who has won the seat thrice — once each as a Janata Dal (1993-1998), Congress (2003-2008) and BJP (2013-2014) member.Amid this game of musical chairs, Congress has gone for a fresh face in the form of Pramod Kumar Yadav (46). Yadav dismissed the idea that this could prove to be a disadvantage. “I am a local and, so, understand the issues well. Neither AAP nor BJP have done any work here. I know the needs of the schools and colleges here and I will work towards them,” he said.Bidhuri alleged that development had come to a standstill in the five years under AAP. He said: “The DTC buses I had started were stopped and so was Ganga water supply (referring to the water drawn from Sonia Vihar). They haven’t been able to lay sewer lines. Where are the new schools and colleges they are talking about?”Bidhuri claimed that if BJP won the election, together with the party’s government at the Centre, it could build new schools, colleges and hospitals. “The area is heavily populated and needs schools and colleges. The land here comes under the Centre’s purview. So, it’s clear that if the same party is in office at both state and Centre, it will be good for development.” Like in the rest of the city, BJP is betting big on Citizenship Amendment Act here too. “Our stand on CAA is clear. We are explaining to the people that it (CAA) has nothing to do with Indian Muslims.”Netaji, on the other hand, believes that all issues will pale in significance in front of the “Kejriwal wave”. He said: “AAP government has worked really hard. People are only going to vote for development. I have been working as a politician for 25 years.”Residents, however, aren’t so keen on passing a clear verdict already. Ram Kumar, who irons clothes for a living at Molarbandh village, said: “It’s clear that the MLA (Sharma) didn’t work and that’s why he didn’t get a ticket again. I’ve been running from pillar to post for over a year for senior citizen’s pension, but to no avail.” He was, however, quick to add that “Netaji is here this time and he’s very good”.Vimal Kumar, who owns a grocery shop at Badarpur, said in a similar vein: “Anyone can walk up to Netaji’s house. He is always ready to help people out.” Manoj Bindal, a resident of Molarbandh village, differs: “Bidhuriji is a little arrogant, but he has done a lot of work. No development has taken place here in the last five years. Whenever it rains, dirty sewer water enters our houses.”",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73683935,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-22088,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi-assembly-elections/battle-down-south-old-guards-new-allegiances-a-fresh-face/articleshow/73676956.cms

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation (NMSCDCL) on Monday said the city requires 4,000 closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras and 800 of them are to be installed under the smart city project by May this year.

The remaining 3,200 CCTV cameras will be installed through private companies under the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds and also through funds from MPs and MLAs.

The project of CCTV cameras, Wi-Fi and Information Communication Technology (ICT) is being implemented by the Maharashtra Information Technology Corporation (MahaIT) at a total cost of Rs 169 crore. Of this total amount the contribution of NMSCDCL is Rs 45.43 crore.

The MahaIT will install 800 CCTV cameras under the project. Moreover, the command and control room is also being set up by the MahaIT for monitoring different projects.

“The requirement of CCTV cameras for entire Nashik city is over 4,000 cameras, but it is not possible to cover the entire city under this project. Only 800 CCTV cameras are to be installed under the smart city project, but we have chalked out a business model to install the remaining CCTV cameras in the city,” NMSCDCL chairman Sitaram Kunte said.

“We have plans to install other remaining cameras through private companies under the CSR. Moreover, funds from MLAs, MPs along with District Planning Development funds can also be used,” Kunte said.

The NMSCDCL chief also said that they will provide the technical specification of the cameras and locations to install the CCTV cameras.

“Earlier, MahaIT had sought the NMSCDCL to release its contribution of Rs 45.43 crore in one go, but we had decided to release the funds as per the progress of the work. We have given approval to release all the funds in order to give momentum to the project work,” Kunte said.

Bareilly: A 15-year-old school boy was allegedly thrashed to death by his classmates over a petty issue at a government upper primary school in Amirnagar village of Lakhimpur Kheri district on Monday. The deceased, identified as Farmaan Qureshi, was a student of Class VI. He had a quarrel with his three friends over purchasing a guava after school hours on Saturday.

Basic Shiksha Adhikari’s (BSA) Budhpriya Singh, when contacted, told TOI, “Police have taken appropriate steps in this case while we have called a probe to ascertain whether any negligence was shown on the part of any school teacher.”

On Monday morning, after the weekend, when Farmaan reached school along with his cousin Tauheed, all three of them thrashed him mercilessly which reportedly led to his death. Police have sent the boy’s body for autopsy. All the three boys of same age group were detained by school staff and handed over to police.

An FIR has been registered against under IPC section 302 (murder) against all three of them on the complaint of Farmaan’s father. However, police later claimed that Farmaan was thrashed by only one of the accused.

After getting the information about the shocking incident, SSP Poonam along with DM Shailendra Singh also rushed to the village and spoke with the aggrieved family. They had a word with the main accused who had allegedly punched and kicked Farmaan. The accused claimed that he never intended to kill Farmaan and only punched him in his stomach.

Farmaan’s father Saimur said, “My nephew Tauheed, who studies in the same school, told me that Farmaan was thrashed by three schoolchildren in the presence of a school teacher. The accused sat on his chest and repeatedly thrashed him to death.”

BSA’s Budhpriya Singh also said, “The incident occurred around 9.30am when the schoolchildren had started arriving and most teachers were yet to arrive. The school starts at 10am. It was indeed an unfortunate incident as one of the children died during a quarrel in the school in Mohammadi block.”

SHO Mohammadi police station Sanjay Tyagi told TOI, “We have registered an FIR against three school children as per the complaint lodged with us but initial investigation suggests that the deceased had a quarrel with only one of them. We have recorded the statement of schoolchildren who witnessed the fight between both the boys and it seems like it was an accidental death. We are waiting for autopsy report to ascertain the main cause of death. The accused will be sent to juvenile home.”

Representative image

PUNE: A 19-year-old polytechnic student was found dead in the Mutha ghat section of Pirangut-Lavasa Road, about 25km from the city, on Saturday. The police said it was a case of suicide.

His father (49) had lodged a missing person’s complaint with the Airport police station on January 20. “The boy had sent a text message to his father on his cellphone before ending his life. The message read ‘Sorry Dad. Because of me you were troubled’,” inspector Ashok Dhumal of the Paud police said.

He said the student’s body was found partially burned, while his motorcycle was gutted completely. “The grass at the area where his body was found was burnt too. After reviewing the spot, we think that the student rode his motorcycle at high speed in the Mutha ghat section and drove it over the railings of the road before plunging into the valley,” Dhumal said, adding, “He was the only child of his parents.”

He said after falling into the valley, the student might have lost his consciousness and his motorcycle might have caught fire.

According to the Airport police, the student was pursuing his studies at a private polytechnic college in Wagholi. “On January 20, he attended his morning classes. He informed his classmates that he was going to Regional Transport Office (RTO) in Pune for some work and left the college around 12.30pm,” the police said.

The student used to return home by late afternoon usually. When he did not return home till evening on January 20, his family members started searching for him, but to no avail. They then filed a missing person’s complaint with the Lonikand police before approaching the Airport police.

“The Pune city police tracked down his location on January 25 after he sent a text message to his father. They then informed us about his location, following which our team reached the spot,” Dhumal said.

“We will conduct an inquiry later on to ascertain the reason behind the suicide. For now, we have registered a case of accidental death in this regard,” he said.

The PMPML has in the past two years scrapped 300 old buses. RTO guidelines state that a bus has to be scrapped... Read More

PUNE: A PMPML official ’s justification of not to scrap a worn-out bus in its fleet by equating it with an ageing parent has left a transport activist flummoxed.

Transport activist Sanjay Shitole had in a WhatsApp message drawn the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited ’s (PMPML) attention towards an old, rickety bus carrying passengers from Shivajinagar to Aundh.

The answer from the PMPML, Shitole said, was: “The PMPML has a minimum life expectancy of between 12 and 15 years for around 40% of the buses. It is because of this reason that the body of the bus is in a bad condition. Considering the less manpower, we are doing our best. How can you call a bus, which has plied for close to 18 hours for more than 12 years, a ‘bhangar’ (scrap)? Do you call parents and relatives, who have completed 70 years and have taken care of us, as scrap?”

Shitole said, “I was travelling in a can on Friday morning when I saw the bus. It was very old and in a bad condition. I thought that plying such buses was risky for passengers. I sent the PMPML a WhatsApp message on its complaint number...I was expecting a professional answer, but got something else.”

The transport activist said after he got the PMPML’s reply on Saturday, he forwarded it to the transport utility’s chief engineer.

PMPML joint managing director Ajay Charthankar told TOI, “The reply to Shitole’s message was not professional”. “I will have to check this and also see which official had sent the message and why.”

The PMPML has in the past two years scrapped 300 old buses. According to the Regional Transport Office’s guidelines, a bus has to be scrapped once it has completed 7 lakh km of running and/or has been in service for 10 years.

PUNE: Day temperatures in Pune have touched the season's highest with Shivajinagar recording a high June-like temperature on Sunday at 32.8 degrees celsius and 33 degrees celsius in Lohegaon, making it the warmest Republic Day in the last three years.

Humidity levels were high in all the three locations in Pune at Shivajinagar, Lohegaon and Pashan on Sunday. Humidity levels touched 90% and more late in the night and morning hours with the city's real feel temperature seeming at least a degree or two higher than the actual day temperature.

Past Republic Day temperature records showed that January 26, 2017, 2018, 2019 had day and night temperatures much below what they were this Sunday.

Night temperatures on the Republic Day in the last few years were at a cold 8.3 degrees celsius and 9.9 degrees celsius in 2019 and 2018 respectively, while day temperatures then was at least 2-5 degrees lower than Sunday's maximum.

Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD Pune, told TOI that the current day temperatures are quite unusual because January is a winter month.

If only Republic Day temperature data for over a decade is considered, Republic Day this year was the second warmest since 2010. On January 26, 2016, the maximum temperature in Shivajinagar was only a decimal point higher (32.9 degrees celsius ) than Sunday’s 32.8 degrees celsius.

Sunday’s day temperature in Lohegaon was the warmest Republic Day for the location since 2010 as the maximum temperature had peaked to a warm 33 degrees celsius.

“There has been increased humidity lately, but it has not been enough to cause cloudy skies during the day, which is what happened on Sunday. While the clear skies ensured that maximum solar insolation reached Pune’s atmospheric surface, the high levels of humidity pushed up the city’s real feel temperature, giving the air a June-like feel. The high amount of humidity in the air is currently making day temperatures feel at least 1-2 degrees C more than what they actually are. This means that the city’s heat index has risen,” Kashyapi said.

Citizens have also been feeling the heat during noon time. “We were back to turning on the fan on Sunday and Monday for the first time this January,” city-based event manager Saurabh Arora said.

Bareilly: A family in Uttar Pradesh’s Sambhal has alleged that a few men “who came in khaki” barged into their house late on Saturday, took away their two daughters and gangraped them at a secluded spot.

In his complaint to police, the girls’ father has alleged that four men wearing khaki barged into their house to “enquire about some liquor smuggling”.

“After I denied any role in liquor smuggling, they started misbehaving and thrashed me. Later, they took us at gunpoint to some deserted location on the outskirts where they took turns to rape our two daughters,” he said.

One of the daughters told TOI, “My father was thrashed and we were later dragged by the men who took us to the vehicle parked outside. They took us to some deserted place and raped us by turns. They let us free after around two hours and fled the spot.”

Sambhal superintendent of police Yamuna Prasad said, “The family is unable to reveal the identities of the persons accused of the crime. The written complaint lodged by the family didn’t mention gangrape but a medical examination has been initiated and the report is awaited. An inquiry in the case is currently underway.”

Local police said that an FIR has been registered against unidentified men for ‘assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty’ under IPC’s section 354, among others. Investigation is on.

MANALI: With thousands of tourists trying to reach Solang valley to enjoy snow and snow-related activities, the traffic movement has almost come to a halt on the stretch between Solang and Kulang village. Hundreds of vehicles have been stranded as they are not able to go beyond Palchan village, where the road is partially covered with snow.

The tourist vehicles are slipping on the ice. Many tourists have parked their private cars on the highway, adding to the chaos on the highway.

Many tourists, who were unable to reach Solang, are enjoying snow near Kulang and Palchan villages. Many are reaching Solang after walking for 3km from Palchan and others are hiring four-wheel drive vehicles or all-terrain vehicles. Upset with jams and slippery condition of the road, tourists can be seen parking vehicle anywhere near the snow on Manali-Solang highway.

As authorities did not clear snow from the highway on time, it turned ice. The workers are now removing ice with help of iron bars. Not just tourists, but local residents of Palchan, Ruar, Solang and Kothi villages are also upset over traffic jams.

Amar Thakur, a local resident, said sometimes it is taking more than five hours to cover 10-km distance to Manali . “We feel helpless during medical or other emergency. The highway is narrow at several places and tourists make multiple lanes that choke traffic. We need big parking places at Palchan and Solang. A special plan to manage traffic is the need of the hour,” he said.

Solang valley is still covered with over 75cm of snow, which has otherwise proved to be boon for the hoteliers, local traders and taxi operators.

Bareilly: A 30-year-old woman was set on fire by her beau, in a village in Subhash Nagar of Bareilly on Sunday evening, after she refused to live with him and returned to her husband.

Meenu Devi had eloped with Vinod Kumar in February 2019, leaving her two children with her husband Chandra Pal. On January 23, she returned to Chandra Pal, claiming Vinod used to regularly beat her and that she was missing her children. On Sunday evening, when Chandra was out on work, Vinod barged into their house, poured petrol on her and set her on fire. She was admitted to district hospital by her mother-in-law Parwati Devi with the help of police, where her condition is reportedly critical. Doctors have advised Chandra Pal to take her to a higher facility, as her condition is deteriorating rapidly. Police have filed an FIR against Vinod and are searching for him.

According to sources, Meenu was living with Vinod in a rented house in Rampur, where she even gave birth to a daughter. Vinod often used to return home drunk and thrash her mercilessly, which is why she left him and her newborn daughter in Rampur and returned to live with Chandra Pal, who happily agreed to let her back after she apologised for her mistake.

When Vinod realised Meenu was back with Chandra Pal, he was filled with vengeance. Chandra Pal told TOI, “Vinod was my friend and used to often come to our house. Last year, he gave something to my wife to eat, after which she started following his command and eloped with him. She returned home after her illusion broke and she saw Vinod’s real face. I forgave her for the sake of my children, but Vinod attempted to kill her and my children when I was out on work. My family is being threatened by Vinod, so I’ve requested police to arrest him ASAP.”

Subhash Nagar SHO Harishchandra Joshi told TOI, “We’ve filed an FIR against Vinod and are searching for him. The victim is admitted at district hospital and doctors are trying to save her life.”

Bharti Singh

Chandigarh: Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday restrained the Punjab government from taking any coercive action against popular television comedian Bharti Singh in a case related to hurting religious sentiments. The HC has also issued notice to the state government and the complainant in the case, asking them to file their replies on the petition filed by Bharti.

The case would now come up for hearing on March 25 along with the previous petitions filed on the same issue by director-choreographer Farah Khan and Bollywood actor Raveena Tandon.

On December 25, 2019, Bharti, Farah and Raveena were booked by Ajnala police under Section 295-A of the IPC for deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs. They had allegedly made some comments about ‘Bible’. The FIR was registered on the complaint filed by Sona Masih alias Sonu Jaffar. The allegations against Bharti are that in a web-show, she made a joke of the word ‘Hallelujah’.

In her plea against the FIR, Bharti has submitted that she was one of the guests of the show. Counsel appearing for Bharti, advocate Abhinav Sood submitted that even if the issues/discrepancies pointed out by the complainant are taken on the face of it, there was nothing to perceive that it was intended to hurt the religious sentiments of the Christian community or remotely qualify to constitute an offence under section 295-A of the IPC.

“Just because the petitioner being the participant guest in the show was trying to spell the word ""Hallelujah"" and further because of the profession of the petitioner being stand-up comedian the words uttered by the petitioner unintentionally are now being used to arraign her,” counsel told the HC.

It was also submitted that the show was not being telecast for discussing anything about Christian or Christianity, but it was a show for entertaining people.

In her plea before the HC, Bharti Singh has sought directions to quash the FIR number 200 dated December 25, 2019 registered at police station Ajnala, district Amritsar rural and not to take any action against her till the matter is pending before the HC.

AHMEDABAD: Prakash Vegda, a quilt (dhabla) weaver from Balej, 40km from Veraval in Gir Somnath district , had not heard about colours such as Sugar Almond, Dark Cheddar, Bluestone or Eden before he came to National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) at Gandhinagar earlier this month.“We work predominantly with brown or white with primary colours such as red, blue and green with geometric patterns. For us, weaving with seven to eight different colours was challenging at first — but was exciting as well. We had never done something like that,” said Vegda.He was among the 25 artisans picked by INDEXT-C from six clusters of Gujarat to revamp their weaving and boost their sales and visibility both in and outside Gujarat. The participants included patola weavers from Rajkot and Surendranagar, khadi weavers from Amreli and quilt weavers from Porbandar and Gir Somnath among others.Shubhangi Yadav, associate professor at NIFT and coordinator for the project, said that the primary objective of the training programme was to help the artisans think out of the box.“Artisans often work with the same materials and same designs over the years. While on one hand it makes the designs unique, on the other it does not motivate customers to buy more than one piece in their lifetime,” she said. “Thus, we worked with the artisans closely to introduce them to a new colour palette, new fabric and new design while retaining the soul of their art,” she said.Ketan Makwana was among the single-ikat patola (Rajkot patola) artisans in the training.“One cannot imagine patola out of traditional colours, but this workshop has introduced us not only to new colours while retaining the weaving style but also taught us how to photograph the final product using mobile phones and introduced us to online platforms for artisan products to improve our international reach,” he said.Sunita Agarwal, assistant professor at NIFT, said that the move could give a new lease of life to artisans. “We often get demands to organize workshops on techniques such as jacquard, which they believe have more demand in the market. We thus showed them ways in which they can also weave stories around their craft,” she said.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73694050,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-562862,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/when-artisans-read-seasonal-colour-forecast/articleshow/73676968.cms

PUNE: The day and night temperatures in the city continue to climb, but a gradual dip is likely from Wednesday, India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials told TOI on Monday. The dip will be significant but short-lived, officials said, when night temperature could reach around 10-12 degrees C in the city.

Night temperatures have been high in the last few days ranging from 14-15 degree Celsius. It was only twice this month and this winter, that Pune’s night temperature plunged lower than 10 degrees C—on January 17 when the mercury fell to 8.2 degrees C in Shivajinagar and the next day on January 18, when the location had recorded 9.6 degrees C. Since then, the minimum temperatures have been rising constantly.

Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD Pune, said, “The passage of a western disturbance over northwest India around January 27-28 is likely to bring a drop in night temperatures in parts of the state, including Pune from January 29. The minimum may rise again slightly in the city on January 31, but will come down once more on February 1. But this will be followed by a gradual rise in night temperatures from February 2,” he said.

Meteorologically, minimum temperatures rise when a western disturbance approaches but fall after it passes due to the reduction in moisture in the air and also due to cold, northerly wind flow. Also, the induced cyclonic circulation over southwest Rajasthan and neighbourhood is likely to shift its position with time, which will help cold northerly winds to re-enter partially into the state, especially north Maharashtra.

Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar

PUNE: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Monday iterated that the residents of the state would not be affected by the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) or the National Population Register ( NPR ) because no one can force their implementation.

Addressing a press meet, he said as a tripartite government, there were discussions among the parties over these. “Our chief minister has assured that citizens in our state will not be affected by the NRC or NPR,” he said.

The deputy chief minister said states like Rajasthan, West Bengal, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh — all ruled by single parties — had announced that they would not implement NRC.

Commenting on the depleting funds of the state government as the finance minister, he said even as the registration department was among the departments generating high revenue, he had steered clear of either increasing or decreasing the Ready Reckoner rates and had called for a realistic value.

On the forthcoming expectations of the state from the central budget in the weekend, he said the state was keeping a close watch and would take a call after the budget was tabled.

The deputy chief minister on Monday cleared 1990.84-crore budget for the Pune division — an increase of Rs354.02 crore. Pune district was sanctioned Rs625 crore, Satara Rs325 crore, Solapur Rs424.32 crore, Kolhapur Rs331.52 crore and Sangli Rs285 crore for the 2020-21 financial year.

The meeting was being presided over by minister of state Anup Dhanak of Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) who too had to face local BJP member’s ire on the issue.

Therefore we are going from the meeting as a mark of protest,” he announced.

BJP members and Dhanak then had an arguments over the issue. Later, the minister assured them to bring Middha back and stopped the meeting. Dhanak went out to call the MLA back to the meeting and managed to bring him back after half an hour. It was only then the meeting, in which complaints of local residents, were being heard started.

Sources claimed that Anup followed MLA Middha till Pindara village and appealed to him to attend the meeting. From there, they returned together and held the meeting.

After the meeting, the minister addressed the mediapersons but Middha refrained from speaking on the issue. Dhanak only said, “We have no differences with the BJP MLA. He had some work so he left the meeting, but came back along with me.”

Thiruvananthapuram: Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said he would press for the notice issued to move a resolution in the assembly to recall governor Mohammad Arif Khan.

While responding to minister A K Balan’s statement that there was no issue between the government and the governor, Chennithala said, “LDF is not genuine in its protest against the governor.”

He said the opposition was forced to move a resolution as the government was not ready for it. “The governor had flouted all democratic values of the position he holds and he made a mockery of the Kerala legislature which we hold in high esteem. But the state government is unmoved despite the harsh criticisms made against the assembly and the resolution passed by its members. As a responsible opposition, we cannot remain a mute spectator when our supreme constitutional body is being targeted by a governor,” said Chennithala.

The governor is continuing his tirade against the assembly and humiliating the resolution passed unanimously by the members, he said. “The governor is infact ridiculing the people of the state through his statements,” he added.

“It is unfortunate and strange that the leader of the House was not ready to utter a word despite the governor making harsh criticisms against the assembly. His silence was dubious. It has to be understood that he was not sincere in his words against the CAA. The chief minister has the moral responsibility to register a protest against the comments made by the governor. Since the chief minister was silent, the opposition was forced to come out with a notice in the assembly against the governor,” he said.

Chennithala alleged that the state government and BJP had an unholy nexus and the chief minister’s silence signals it. “This was the reason why the governor showered praise on the chief minister in his Republic Day speech. This has raised several suspicions,” he said. On Republic Day, the chief minister and other ministers had attended the At Home reception organized by the governor at Raj Bhavan while the opposition boycotted the event as a mark of protest.

Chandigarh: The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) at Ropar has tied up with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA, for research to make agricultural practices safer and sustainable. The research will focus on Punjab and Haryana.

Sloan School of Management senior lecturer Chintan Vaishnav is collaborating with IIT Ropar’s department of humanities and social sciences assistant professor Parwinder Singh. They will use ethnography-based system and dynamics modelling to determine the conditions that would be most supportive to the transition from conventional to organic farming.

The research and modelling will focus on the regions of Punjab and Haryana in India, where the problem of chemical overuse in agriculture is most acute. At the close of the project, the team will have a check list-based advisory that smallholder farmers in India can use to guide their risk perception and actions during their transition from conventional to organic farming.

In another research initiative, MIT department of environmental engineering Professor Dara Entekhabi and IIT Ropar department of civil engineering assistant professor Reet Kamal Tiwari are developing a remote sensing device that can draw information on vegetation and soil using active and passive microwave systems.

The species had almost disappeared from the area a few years back

SHIMLA: Strict vigil of local tribal residents, along with the wildlife officials of state, against poaching has ensured an increase in the number of Himalayan Ibex, locally called Tangrol in Lahaul-Spiti district .

Increase in their number is a matter of relief as Himalayan Ibex, though listed in International Union for Conservation for Nature (IUCN) Red Data Book with status of least concern, had almost disappeared from the area a few years back. A subspecies of the Siberian Ibex, Himalayan Ibex is found in the areas of Trans Himalayas region of Ladakh and Greater Himalayas and Pir Panjals of Jammu & Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh .

It was the residents of Lahaul-Spiti district who had stepped forward to save Himalayan Ibex from becoming extinct by joining hands with the state wildlife department. Many panchayats had decided to take action against those found involved in the hunting of Tangrol, especially during winters, by socially outcasting them. No surprise then, in last seven years not even a single case of Ibex hunting has been reported in the district.

Head of Tabo panchayat, Dechen Angmo, said before winters, a general house is called in their panchayat where people are asked to take oath not to killed wild animals during winters.

Langja panchayat head Sher Singh said they have banned hunting due to which rise in the number has been witnessed. Dozens of other panchayats too have taken similar steps.

According to officials, the eastern limit of Ibex’s roaming ground seems to be Bara Lacha La Pass on the north and Satluj Gorge south of the Great Himalayan Range in Himachal Pradesh. The southern most populations may occur south of the Pir Panjal Range in Manali Wild Life Sanctuary in Himachal Pradesh.

Wildlife range officer at Spiti Devender Singh Chauhan said people of entire valley are protectors of wildlife. “We have not seen a single case of poaching here. The Buddhist people here consider killing of Ibex a sin. They do not allow outsiders to harm them either,” he said.

Chauhan said, “We have noticed Kibber wildlife sanctuary had almost no Ibex a few years back but now the animal has made Kibber sanctuary their habitat.” Spiti is known for good number of snow leopards and availability of natural prey like ibex and ghoral is responsible for this, he added. Himalayan Ibex is generally found in steep crags above the tree line in the Himalayas up to 5,500 metres.

Lucknow University

LUCKNOW: Lucknow University will implement choice-based credit system ( CBCS ) in all its post-graduate and PhD programmes from new academic session to give more learning options to students in interdisciplinary subjects.

The structure of CBCS was finalized at a meeting of all heads of departments and deans on Monday.

LU spokesman Durgesh Srivastava said, “Under CBCS, students will be offered non-credited courses, which will be for learning purpose only and no examination will be held, and credited courses where a student will be evaluated. It will offer two types of electives – frozen and open. In frozen elective, a student will have to select a subject from his or her stream while there will no such compulsion in open electives.”

He said postgraduate courses would have a total of 96 credits, including an internship which should be completed in the third semester (wherever applicable) and a dissertation (200 marks) to be completed in fourth semester. Srivastava said each student would be guided by a teacher-mentor.

“Introduction of CBCS will give a major boost to quality of education at university level. It will offer more learning options and greater flexibility to students. They will get an opportunity to learn an extra subject apart from their core courses,” said Srivastava.

The system will also offer Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) which is an online learning and knowledge testing system made available by the Union ministry of human resource development.

The university students will have interdisciplinary and intra-disciplinary learning options as well. For example, in inter-disciplinary choice, a student of science can learn a subject from humanities while in intra-disciplinary option, a PG student of zoology can study botany as one of the subjects.

359,['28/01/2020'],Disciplinary committee to nip dissent in KPCC soon,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran has talked tough against the growing indiscipline in the party where the leaders are coming out against the appointment of new party office bearers.

“However senior the leaders be, those who are making public comments against party decisions will have to face severe disciplinary action,” said Mullappally Ramachandran in the first meeting of the newly-appointed party office bearers. He was indirectly referring to the open statements made by the senior leader K Muraleedharan against the revamp.

Mullappally said the party will soon have a disciplinary committee which will deal with all such disciplinary issues. “No one will be allowed to misuse the social media against the party. All leaders in the party have the freedom to raise their opinions and comments. But it should be made only in the party forum. All the leaders are given enough freedom to air their opinions in the party meetings,” he said.

AICC general secretary K C Venugopal said that AICC has decided to take strict action against those defying party decisions and making comments in the public against the party or its leadership. “The new office bearers have been selected by the AICC leadership to equip the party in Kerala for the ensuing local body elections. The aim of the party now should be to register an impressive victory in the civic body elections. The AICC will not tolerate any other issues,” he said.

Congress working committee member A K Antony who was also present in the meeting said that the party had no time to waste and everyone should stand united to work for the victory of the party in the local body and next assembly elections.

The KPCC president said that the Congress had the tradition of including leaders who were willing to come back to the party. “The inclusion of Mohan Shankar should be seen only in this direction. The party collectively took the decision to give him a new responsibility in the party,” said Mullappally, on the criticism raised by Muraleedharan against including Mohan Shankar as the new general secretary of the party. On complaints that women have not been given enough representation in the new list, Mullappally said there were grievances and they would be rectified when the new secretaries were appointed.

Hundreds of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supporters had gathered to participate in a roadshow , which was also attended by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal . The procession started from Gandhi Nagar-Pusta Road intersection around 5pm, half an hour after the scheduled time.Kejriwal was campaigning for Navin Choudhary (Deepu), the AAP candidate from Gandhi Nagar assembly seat. “Thousands of people participated in the mega road show at Gandhi Nagar. AAP is getting unprecedented support in city,” tweeted Kejriwal later.Besides cars and two-wheelers, hundreds of e-rickshaws joined the cavalcade from nearby areas, including Seelampur.As soon as the roadshow entered the main market, traders welcomed the leaders by showering rose petals. However, due to the weekly bazaar, vehicles were finding it difficult to cross the stretch smoothly.The constituency, which is known for the biggest readymade garments wholesale market, is affected by problems of encroachment, unregulated traffic and congestion. “While the shopkeepers have encroached over 5-6 feet of area for displaying their items, hawkers occupy the roads on Mondays,” said a resident of the area.From Gandhi Nagar, the procession moved to congested lanes of Ragubarpura, Shanti Mohalla and East Old Seelampur, where people showered flower petals from their balconies to welcome Kejriwal.“We had urged for organising the roadshow on a Monday when all shops remain closed.

BHOPAL: In a serious breach of protocol for organ donation, doctors at Gandhi Medical College (GMC), Bhopal assuming a 41-year-old patient as brain dead permitted the patient to be transferred to private hospital cum transplant centre. The patient was declared brain dead when there is no active ‘organ donation committee’.

Now, GMC and Hamidia hospital officials are not taking responsibility for the breach of protocols.

Cadaveric organ donation of the 41-year-old woman captured national headlines when her 10-year-old son opted for the noble deed on Saturday. On ventilator, the patient was shifted to a private hospital and 13 hours later declared dead on Sunday. Only her eyes were donated. The cremation was conducted in Bhopal Sunday. The deceased suffered a brain injury and was admitted in Hamidia hospital since January 23.

Patient was considered fit for organ donation to declared unfit for organ donation within matter of hours. Interestingly, private hospital final report stated patient ‘declared brain dead in Hamidia hospital surgical ICU at 5 pm on January 25’. In the same page, it notes ‘patient underwent cardiac arrest at 8.42 am on January 26.’ No sooner, a post mortem and funeral took place on a holiday.

The private hospital is an authorised centre for organ transplant. Hamidia hospital does not have organ transplant facility. “I am understanding the situation and have taken charge only recently,” said GMC dean Dr Aditya Agrawal.

Hamidia hospital medical superintendent, Dr AK Shrivastava said, “Appointed committee should declare the person as brain dean. Concerned doctors should clarify how the body was sent to private hospital, else it is illegal.” However, GMC organ donation committee awaits an approval from directorate of medical education (DME), admitted GMC HoD ophthalmology Dr Kavita Kumar.

Patient was being treated under GMC department of surgery, Dr SS Pal. When contacted on who gave authorisation for the patient to be declared brain dead and shifted to private hospital, he said, “Do write, I did not respond to your queries.” The goof-up is expected to impact, proposal for start of organ transplant at Hamidia hospital. GMC nephrologist Dr Himanshu Sharma too also did not comment.

Organ donation society representative, Dr Rakesh Bhargava who was point person during the entire case said, “There are certain criteria for declaring a person brain dead. It takes time for person to be stabilised, parameters checked before organ donation can begin.”

For Dr Bhargava’s own prognoses, he admitted that patient’s urine and BP was normal when checked at Hamidia hospital, indicating that her body organs were in acceptable state. “Test reports in private hospital transplant centre were negative for organ donation,” he said.

GMC dean has recently taken charge, he is not aware of the basics, said Dr Bhargava. “Only government recognised doctors can declare a person brain dead,” he admitted.

The family of deceased was asked to submit a written application to Hamidia hospital for shifting of patient ‘suspected brain dead’ to private hospital. As per NOTTO rules, hospital competent authority should have authorised transfer of patient and informed Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (ROTTO).

NEW DELHI: With an internal party survey concluding that almost one-third of Delhi is still unsure about whom to vote for in the assembly polls, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has decided to launch a mega outreach programme covering every single household in the city.Senior party functionaries said that booth-level committees and on-ground workers have been told to ensure that every household is visited with the party’s symbol, photo of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the list of works done by the Centre as the chunk of about 30% voters still sitting on the fence have the capability of swinging the poll either way.BJP believes that it enjoys a fixed vote share of 32-33%. With campaigns generating heat and polling less than two weeks away, senior party functionaries said that the survey has indicated that their vote share is steadily rising.“This clearly points towards an anti-incumbency factor. These undecided voters can easily be tapped and convinced to vote for BJP,” said a senior party functionary, who is part of the core committee supervising the elections.Sources said the focus is more on A and B-level constituencies, which had always supported BJP but went with AAP in the 2015 polls. In C-level constituencies — dominated by minorities or reserved segments — the party has decided to target those pockets that supported them in the 2019 Lok Sabha election.About 250 party functionaries, including BJP national president JP Nadda, Union home minister Amit Shah, cabinet ministers and Delhi MPs, have been holding close to 400 public meetings and direct dialogue with voters every day. In the next 12 days, more than 10,000 hyperlocal meetings have been planned.Apart from over one lakh ground-level BJP workers, thousands of RSS activists have also been holding corner meetings and visiting door-to-door.Shah, who is micro-managing the campaign, has been in regular touch with the coordinators at the parliamentary constituency and assembly segment levels by taking regular updates and sending instructions. In a meeting of social media volunteers on Saturday, he had urged them to bring maximum voters on polling day. A massive social media campaign is also being launched to influence fence-sitters.After hectic campaigning, which includes addressing at least 2-3 public meetings and leading roadshows, the top functionaries get into a huddle, review the day’s campaign and work out the strategy for the next day, said party sources.“Since the survey report, the central leadership is keen on continuing the momentum and mobilising workers and sympathisers to garner support.

Kochi: The central government failed in contributing its share to the project for treating children with rare diseases even when the state government set apart funds for three years, the high court said in an order.

Though the policy introduced by the central government in 2017 to provide treatment for children with rare diseases was withdrawn in 2018, a division bench comprising Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly ordered the government to deposit Rs 1.5 crore in the state corpus within 15 days. The court pointed out that such amount was due as per the policy that existed and that the state government had deposited its share in 2017, 2018, and 2019.

In order to create a national and state-level corpus, National Policy for Treatment of Rare Diseases was introduced in July 2017. The central government was to provide 60% of the funds whereas the state government had to provide 40%. State government had deposited Rs 50 lakh during the three years since then. The central government had kept the implementation of the policy in abeyance through a notification issued in December 2018.

Noting that the central government should have contributed Rs 75 lakh each for 2017, 2018, and 2019, the court said in the order, “Having regard to the prompt treatment which is required for the above said rare diseases and the number of death of children, we are of the view that there is a failure on the part of Union of India in contributing 60% of the share as per the National Policy. Therefore, we direct respondent No.5 (central government) to deposit a sum of Rs 1.5 crores in the State Corpus which is due, as per the then existing National Policy, within 15 days from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.”

Dr. Sunil Prakash, the CEO of California Hypnosis Institute, Gurgaon, talked about the connection between body and soul at the JLF on Friday.

Prakash has been teaching and practicing clinical hypnotherapy since 2008.

“Life has been made extremely complicated, not by our body, not by our will, but by our soul. Soul is the real culprit. A lot of times people ask me what is the connection between body and soul as well as about past life. Hypnosis has helped me in answering few of these questions,” said Prakash.

Prakash said a human body was just being used as a mere bank account by this accountant called the soul. He said the soul maintained the karmic accounts of not only current life, but also of all its previous as well as future lives.

“The soul keeps the karmic account to manipulate all information for its own selfish motive of experiencing everything before finally evolving and becoming one with the super consciousness that is the Creator. In this process, it grossly exploits and tarnishes the body. Sadly, as soon as the soul’s plans are accomplished and desires fulfilled through our body, it leaves the body lifeless, just like a useless piece of machinery, closes the account, further moving on to start a new a journey thereby assuming another physical body to fulfil its next set of objectives,” said Prakash.

BMIDU VC Shruti Sadolikar Katkar at the press conference

Lucknow: The vice chancellor of Bhatkhande Music Institute Deemed University (BMIDU) on Monday denied allegations of harassment levelled by the family of deceased sarangi player Pandit Vinod Mishra against her.

In a press conference, VC Shruti Sadolikar Katkar claimed that Mishra’s retirement benefits were held back by Uttar Pradesh culture department and that he was sent on compulsory retirement by the management council of the university as disciplinary action.

Mishra, who worked in the university for 34 years as an accompanist, died on January 23, seven days before his 62nd birthday, during treatment at SGPGI.

Mishra’s daughter Preeti (29) had claimed that her father had been continually harassed since 2018 after he went to attend a concert abroad on the invitation of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). On his return, Mishra was suspended from the university and had to approach court to get reinstated. Next year, after Mishra returned from cataract surgery, he was given “compulsory retirement”, Preeti said.

Because of that, the family slumped into economic crises as the university had allegedly also held back his retirement benefits. The family claimed that because he didn’t receive his monetary dues, he was depressed, leading to death, they said.

Preeti has submitted a complaint to Kaiserbagh police station, alleging harassment. However, no FIR has been lodged so far.

In the press conference, Katkar said that in 2018, Mishra had applied for leave for a concert but it was rejected because the university had assigned his duty in a seminar at the time. Despite that, Mishra went on leave. When he returned, disciplinary action was taken against him. However, when asked for the date or document of assigning the duty to Mishra, the VC was not able to provide it. Katkar continued that next year, Mishra went on unplanned leave for which the university council sent him on compulsory retirement. The VC also claimed that laxity in releasing his dues was on the part of the culture department.

Potholes on roads between Safilguda Railway Junction and AOC tracks filled with bitumen.

SECUNDERABAD: Roads under the Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) have finally been repaired, much to the relief of commuters who travel through these stretches daily.

Over a lakh commuters pass through the roads that connect residential areas such as Safilguda, Mallikarjuna Nagar, Dayanand Nagar, Neredmet, Yapral, Balaji Nagar and adjoining areas. Even the roads near Safilguda Railway Gate and Army Railway Tracks are busy throughout the day.

The United Federation of Residential Welfare Associations (UFERWAS) had filed several complaints with the garrison engineer (north), SCB, urging the authorities concerned to repair the potholes to avoid accidents.

“Traffic congestions during peak hours have become a daily affair on Ordnance Road near Safilguda Railway Gate. Vehicles often get damaged as vehicles move slowly and it put a lot of pressure on the engine and brakes,” UFERWAS general secretary BT Srinivasan told TOI.

The Residential Welfare Associations (RWAs) had appealed to the army authorities several times, but no action was taken. Last monsoon, many motorists met with road accidents and were badly injured due to the bad roads especially beside the army railway tracks, Srinivasan said.

“Finally, the garrison engineer (north) took note of our complaints and initiated repair of the roads. The workers filled up all the potholes with bitumen,” Srinivasan pointed out.

“The patchwork is a temporary fix and the SCB authorities should take up complete re-carpeting works. This will ensure a smoother ride for commuters,” said a resident of Safilguda, P Kamalakar.

SVPI Airport

AHMEDABAD: Improved connectivity, more direct flights to newer destinations from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad, has led to a significant increase in international passenger movements. According to data given by Airport Authority of India (AAI), international tourist arrivals at the SVPI airport in Ahmedabad went up by 16% in 2019, with some 24.09 lakh international passengers moving in and out of the city airport during the year. The number of international passengers handled at the SVPI airport in Ahmedabad stood at 20.6 lakh in 2018.

“The connectivity to international destinations has tremendously improved from SVPI airport. We now have direct flights to destinations such as Turkey, whereas direct connectivity to existing destinations has increased significantly. Moreover, some of the airlines have upgraded with higher seating capacity aircraft and others plan to do so. As a result, the overall passenger movement has increased significantly and will further go up,” said Manoj Gangal, director, SVPI airport.

Travel experts also attribute the growth in passenger movement to the heritage city status conferred upon Ahmedabad; in addition to a slew of foreign investments that have taken shape.

“Several foreign companies have invested in Gujarat and most of them are in and around Ahmedabad, as a result of which, movement of international business delegates has significantly increased at the city. This number is growing year on year and is visible with several hotels in the city hosting international guests,” said a city-based tour operator.

“At the same time, increased frequency of flights to popular tourist destinations coupled with affordable and competitive airfares has led to an uptick in the number of passengers taking international trips,” said Anuj Pathak, secretary, Tour Operators and Travel Agents Association (TAG).

Even domestic passenger movement at SVPI airport showed a promising 8.4% growth in 2019, with 93.1 lakh domestic passengers travelling from the airport against 85.8 lakh in 2018.

Kozhikode: The Hill Highway project in Kozhikode is likely to take off soon after getting rid of all the stumbling blocks.

Out of the four stretches of the hill highway through Kozhikode, three stretches have already received financial sanction.

The PWD officials are expecting to start the work of the fourth stretch in the district in the first phase as the detailed project report for the work has already received technical sanction. Though e-tender for the work also was started, the tender could not be allotted as only one bidder turned up to take up the project.

“We are now planning to re-tender the work of the fourth stretch, Kodenchery- Kakkadampoyil stretch, of the proposed alignment in the first phase,” said R Sindhu, executive engineer PWD (roads). We are also hoping to get technical sanction for the other stretches soon, she said.

The total length of the Kodenchery-Kakkadampoyil stretch is 34.4km and the issues related to the alignment and land has already been settled for the stretch. According to the figures, land possessed by 987 land owners is being used for the fourth stretch of the hill highway from Kodenchery to Kakkadampoyil.

The PWD has also started the utility shifting on the first reach of Hill Highway in the district connecting Vilangad and Thottilpalam. The total length of the stretch is 28km.

On the other hand, the preliminary work of the second stretch of the Hill Highway connecting Thottilpalam with Thalayad is progressing at a slow pace owing to legal hurdles and opposition from land owners. There has been rift between the residents and the PWD regarding the alignment of the 37.6km stretch.

The third stretch, which is the shortest reach in Kozhikode district, has received financial sanction. The work of the road extending to 17.8km will be completed spending Rs 48.75 crore.

Apart from the road construction activity, the fund for reconstructing the compound walls of those who hand over their land for the road, will also be earmarked, said MLA Karat Razak. Tender process for the stretch will begin immediately after getting technical sanction, said the MLA.

The hill highway stretch in Kozhikode is part of the 1332km-long Hill Highway connecting Nandarapadavu in Kasaragod district with Parassala in Thiruvananthapuram. The total length of the hill highway in Kozhikode is nearly 120km.

Vishvendra Singh

Rajasthan has exploited only 20% of its tourism potential, said state tourism minister Vishvendra Singh while speaking at Jaipur Literature Festival on Monday.

Singh said tourism has immense potential in Rajasthan, much is being done and much more needs to be done if we are to truly exploit it. “The state has only exploited 20% of its tourism potential. There is need to focus on ethical and sustainable tourism by way of which we leave minimal impact on the places we visit.”

He was speaking at ‘Sustainable and Responsible Tourism’ session along with Dr Rashmi Dickinson and Dr Edward Dickinson.

Singh said, the desert state has the maximum number of heritage hotels in the country. “We gave and are giving special concessions to heritage properties which have contributed to this large figure. Smaller interventions can take us a long way towards practicing responsible tourism. Without losing money and making heavy duty investments, we can make a conscious effort to source food locally, employ locals and involve the global community,” he said.

Singh also spoke about formulation of new tourism policy and said that the state government is in the process of formulating a ‘New Tourism Policy’ taking initiative to maximise, socialize and economise benefits to the local communities, conserve natural resources, protect heritage and begin awareness in a campaign mode.He also touched upon recycling of waste and said by recycling waste, valuing our water and electricity, reducing plastic waste, we can keep culture and environment at the heart of our businesses.

AHMEDABAD: The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the impact of occupational health on global GDP at 3-4% annually. In a country like India, where about 90-92% of the workforce is in informal sector, the figure could be higher, said experts who gathered at the Indian Institute of Public Health , Gandhinagar (IIPH-G) as part of an international workshop on occupational and environmental health.

Prof Dileep Mavalankar , director, IIPH-G, said the workshop was held to understand global best practices and how to implement them in the Indian context. D

r Shyam Pingle , senior occupational health specialist from IIPH-G, said that the initiative to improve occupational health should start from the general physician’s level. “Studies show that MBBS students learn about occupational health only for about 20 hours in their entire course. Data collection is a major issue while assessing the impact of a person’s occupation on his/her health and cause of death,” he said.

Prof Gert van der Laan, from the Netherlands, said that regulations and implementations are stricter in several European nations. “When it was found that pesticides were causing illness among the Dutch farmers, rules about procurement and use of pesticides were introduced and the chemicals were made expensive. The move brought desired results,” he said.

“In Italy, the occupational healthcare professionals have powers of an enforcement officer who can visit industrial areas and can also take legal action. Data collection is also stringent where it can point towards major hazardous factors in time,” said Prof Claudio Colosio, University of Milan, Italy.

375,['28/01/2020'],"CAA/NRC won’t affect even one Indian Muslim, assures Rajnath Singh","This story is from January 28, 2020

Defence minister Rajnath Singh (File photo)

MANGALURU: Defence minister Rajnath Singh asserted on Monday that not a single Muslim in India would be thrown out of the country due to the proposed National Register of Citizens and that the Bharatiya Janata Party would throw its might behind the community if a single member of this community feels persecuted by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. This is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s motto of “Sab Ka Saath, Sab Ka Vikas aur Sab Ka Vishwas”, he added at a pro-CAA rally here on Monday.

Assailing Congress for spreading fear among Muslims regarding a law that both Houses of Parliament debated and passed, Rajnath addressed the mammoth rally organised by the BJP district unit here. He said BJP has merely fulfilled a wish that Mahatma Gandh had directed Congress to do post-Independence. This was also in the resolution adopted by the Congress Working Committee on November 25, 1947, he said.

Asking the crowd if government discriminated based on religion in implementing its various flagship programmes such as Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana and Ayushman Bharat or in providing various infrastructure works, Rajnath wondered how the same government could discriminate with CAA. “How can the opposition accuse us of being discriminatory with this step their leaders wanted?” he asked.

Reminding Congress that it implemented the NRC based on a Supreme Court directive, Rajnath said, “NRC naam ki chidiya hum (BJP) logon ne nahin laya tha!” CAA is a balm the government is using to apply to the souls of persecuted minorities from India’s theocratically ruled neighbours and is not to hurt any Indian citizen, he said, adding that Congress, seeped in hatred for the ruling government, can’t see anything good it does.

Noting that there is a concerted attempt on the part of Congress to drive a wedge between Hindus and Muslims using the CAA, Rajnath said it wouldn’t be surprising if foreign powers were behind it. The former BJP national chief exhorted the party’s rank and file to explain to Muslims that their citizenship was not under threat and they would continue to enjoy their rights as any other citizen.

Rajnath said the opposition should not forget the “national dharma”. Let the opposition question the continuing persecution of minorities in neighbouring Pakistan, he said. While CAA is only to accommodate persecuted minorities from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, the majority of whom are Dalits, why should anyone have any objection to it, he asked.

Noting that as home minister in the Modi government’s first innings he had given citizenship to over 600 Muslims, including Pakistani singer Adnan Sami , Rajnath said Muslims from India’s theocratic neighbours wanting to become Indian citizens are still able to do so under CAA provisions. Even with the NPR that Congress introduced in 2010, no one will be forced to give their personal details, such as their father’s name or date of birth, he said.

BHOPAL: Amid reports of the 150-year-old Taj Mahal palace going back under the state government control, a major tragedy was averted at the heritage palace after a fire broke out at the gate of the palace towards Bara Mahal late on Sunday night. Though the 20-feet tall ceiling, precious fescos and other decorative parts were partially damaged, no one was injured in the fire, BMC fire brigade officials said.

Local residents spotted the fire and alerted the emergency services. “The fire was doused within about half-an-hour. It was reported at 11:51 pm on Sunday night. No one was injured in the incident,” confirmed BMC fire brigade officials.

The fire was triggered in blankets and pillows of homeless people who have occupied the gate of the palace. Dial 100 was alerted and the police informed the fire brigade.

“The gate has been has been completely cordoned off,” said a representative of private group in charge of Taj Mahal. Meanwhile, senior MPT official confirmed that notices to the private group has been issued.

Local resident, Junaid Kidwai alleged that Taj Mahal agency was alerted about the possibility of such incidents and its impact on the heritage property. Earlier too, there was a homeless family living along the old heritage gate towards, Bara Mahal, he claimed. The family was removed about a month back. The belongings including pillows and blankets were left behind.

Police have registered a case and have initiated investigation in the case.

For over a decade, various heritage conservationists have called for restoration and protection of the palace, considered one of the best examples of 18th century architecture in India. In 2011, the palace was de-notified as a protected heritage by the state government and since then, the property has been under Madhya Pradesh tourism (MPT) which has given it to a private group on a 96-year lease.

The move follows, a ‘ Bhopal Vision Statement’ released during the general elections, which called for protection of all heritage properties in the city. Value and historicity of the place has been valued in crores. Dozens of encroachments along the Motia Talab and Bab-e-Aali side of the Taj Mahal palace that have cropped up in the last six months, have gone unnoticed by the government.

Porvorim: The debate over questions raised in the assembly going missing or being clubbed with others refused to die down, with Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte on Monday saying that deliberate attempts were being made by the government to hinder public accountability.

Khaunte met speaker Rajesh Patenkar at the assembly complex to discuss his concerns that several questions raised by him had been clubbed with questions raised by other MLAs. “The government should realise that it is answerable to the questions we are asking, and it is our privilege to get replies,” he said.

The meeting did not appear to be fruitful with both sides claiming that the other was wrong. After the meeting, Patnekar told reporters that as per rules and procedure of the House, the legislature secretariat could club questions from multiple MLAs.

Opposition leader Digambar Kamat, Khaunte and Goa Forward Party president Vijai Sardesai have claimed that some of the questions raised by them have been omitted by the legislature secretariat to ensure that the government does not face fire in the upcoming budget session.

Lucknow: Laxity of Lucknow Municipal Corporation zonal and beat officials may cost the city its ranking in the ongoing Swachhta Survey. According to LMC, its zonal officials of Gomtinagar were found missing from their allotted duties on Sunday, which included supervision of garbage collection in the areas between 6am and 10am every day.

“Both the zonal and beat incharge have been blacklisted and action will be taken against them for skipping their duties,” said additional municipal commissioner Amit Singh .

The officials’ absence resulted in no garbage collection in zone-4 on Sunday. Their absence coincided with third party inspection by the ministry of housing and urban affairs which is awarding marks to civic bodies under Swachhta Survey. Since the central authorities are conducting surprise inspection in various parts of the city till January 31, the officials’ absence on Sunday is being seen as a lapse on LMC’s part. During inspection, if the central team finds littered garbage in open it can deduct as many as 350 marks from Lucknow’s total marking.

Lucknow has been performing poorly in swachhta surveys for the past three years. City was ranked 269th out of 408 cities in 2017. Its ranking improved to 118th rank in 2018, but slipped to 121 among 425 cities last year.

SECUNDERABAD: The Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority ( HMDA ) officials have taken up a detailed study on the feasibility of installing escalators at Oliphant Bridge near Secunderabad Railway Station.

Though the study was initially proposed by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), North Zone, the project was finally initiated by HMDA.

Hundreds of pedestrians walk under the Oliphant Bridge daily and the escalators will help them cross the bridge easily.

The authorities concerned have also proposed to construct skywalks in the area connecting four sides of the main junction at Oliphant Bridge (towards Bhoiguda side), for the convenience of those travelling from Secunderabad Railway Station Terminal-II (Bhoiguda) towards either Tarnaka, Sitaphalmandi, RTC X Roads and Rathifile bus stand or Secunderabad Metro Rail East.

“The study of this important junction has been entrusted to the civil engineering wing of Osmania University,” sources in HMDA told TOI.

Meanwhile, officials of Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWSSB) have repaired the leaking sewage pipe under the bridge. Now, pedestrians do not have to walk on dirty water.

“Once the escalators are installed under the bridge, it will benefit hundreds of pedestrians who cross it daily, said T Shankar Das, a resident of Sitaphalmandi.

LUCKNOW: A teacher of a private school in Gomtinagar Extension was booked for assault and criminal intimidation for allegedly beating a 9-year-old girl, a student of Class 4, and threatening to kill her if she dared to inform her parents about the incident.

The incident took place on Thursday last week while the FIR was lodged by the girl’s mother on Saturday.

The girl’s mother informed police that the class teacher hit her daughter with the edge of a book on Thursday. “My daughter fell on the floor due to the impact and started crying. The teacher threatened my daughter that she would kill her if she informed us about the incident,” she said.

However, the girl mustered courage and informed her parents.

Spokesman of the school, Rishi Khanna, said: “We have issued a notice to the teacher and asked her to give an explanation. If her answer is not found satisfactory, she will be dismissed. Physical assault on students is strictly prohibited in the school.” In her complaint, the girl’s mother claimed that other students of the class were traumatized and her daughter was also in pain since the incident took place.

The complainant said she sent her daughter again to the school on Saturday but the school administration informed her that her daughter was complaining of headache and she should take the girl home.

“I reported the incident to school authorities but they took no action,” she informed cops.

Investigating officer in the case, sub-inspector Baleshwar Prasad, said an FIR had been lodged and statements of the accused teacher and the complainant would be recorded on Tuesday.

Visitors at Diggi Palace, the venue of Jaipur Literature Festival, in the city on Monday

Unless you see it with your own eyes, the scale and magnitude of Jaipur Literature Festival is quite difficult to imagine. As a first-time author, I had the good fortune of being invited to speak at this prestigious event, considered the Mecca of all literature festivals. And I was overwhelmed.

Held at the Diggi Palace Hotel , and we hear for the last time before it moves to another venue, it’s a festival in every sense. The dinner on the opening night itself, held at the Rambagh Palace, was itself quite a grand spectacle and a harbinger of the things to come. Food of all types and suited for different palates was there. But what attracted my attention were the traditional Rajasthani food counters. One had women making different types of rotis (the bajra roti turned out to be everyone’s favourite) on chulhas, the traditional Indian stove made of mud. Another was a chutney counter where men with stylish moustaches ground various spices and herbs on a mortar and pestle and gave you the tangy and spicy flavours of Rajputana. Everything about it was royal. And why not, after all it was held at the palace of the former royals of Jaipur.

But for me, it was a tad overwhelming too. Every attendee there was a somebody. And I had so many fanboy moments, seeing some of my favourite authors and celebrities for the first time in real life. But thankfully, I bumped into award-winning author Annie Zaidi who turned out to be an amazingly down-to-earth and forward-looking person. I met Prof Anisur Rahman of Jamia Millia Islamia who is one of the key figures of Rekhta Foundation. I also met historian S Irfan Habib, publisher Atiya Zaidi and author and translator Dr Rakshanda Jalil. Together, they became my comfort zone.

The following morning, on January 23, the festival officially opened. My session was from 12.30pm-1.30pm at the front lawn. I was invited to speak on Mughal Emperor Akbar due to the fact that I wrote a biography of the emperor, which came out in October last year. My co-panellist was historian Supriya Gandhi who teaches at Yale and who has recently authored a biography of Mughal prince Dara Shukoh. We both were to be in conversation with festival co-director and celebrated author, William Dalrymple.

I thanked my stars for being on a panel moderated by William, but I was also nervous because, well, it’s supposed to be a big thing at a big venue. William made me feel very comfortable, and eventually, I lost my stage fright. It also helped that Supriya Gandhi turned out to be a warm and friendly person while being such a formidable historian. Our conversation before the event had steadied my nerves quite a bit, so the conversation on stage went quite well.

The session was called ‘Akbar and Dara’ and was a thorough discussion on the relevance of the Mughals and why they are so reviled today. Supriya outlined Dara’s princely exploits and his wish to be a model sovereign. I spoke about how our understanding of the past is shaped by our present and that brings in biases. That explains why a BJP spokesperson had equated Akbar with Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. That also explains why the term ‘secular’ is often used retrospectively to describe these two Mughals.

We discussed all this and more and the audience received it favourably. During the Q&A session that followed, a young woman asked Supriya if she would ever consider joining politics (she’s the daughter of Rajmohan Gandhi). Supriya said that she does academic interventions with her scholarship but it’s tough for people with her surname to be in politics in India today. Her response was cheered by all and sundry.

The rest of the day I hopped different venues to catch different sessions. I also managed to sign quite a few copies at the JLF bookstore there. The masala chai served on kulhads at the venue were quite something.

But despite all the charms of JLF, I was there only for the first day. I returned to Delhi on January 24, carrying back tonnes of cherishable memories, and the hope to be back.

Nobel economics laureate Abhijit Banerjee during a session at Jaipur Literature Festival on Monday

Arguing against the belief that authoritarian regimes are better positioned to drive economic growth and deliver on promises, Nobel economics laureate Abhijit Banerjee said the success of China or Singapore owes much more to the decentralisation of power than otherwise.

Speaking at the Jaipur Literature Festival (JLF), the India-born American economist said, “You can easily argue that Singapore had a successful dictator and can easily come back and talk about Zimbabwe. We can talk about this ad nauseum… At some level authority is an illusion.”

To the TOI journalist’s question as to what are the stress points of the economy, the MIT economist, who with his wife Esther Duflo and Harvard professor Michael Kremer jointly won the 2019 Nobel Economics prize, said, “We also know that due to a demand deficit in the economy, cars and two-wheelers are not selling, and those things are signs of a general fact that people lack confidence that the economy is going to grow fast so they are holding back, they are not spending.”

While he said that some economic indicators in recent months have shown signs of revival, it is not to easy to reboot the economy quickly.

“We are in a deep cycle. It will take some time to fix things, particularly the banking sector. We don’t have the money to do what China did which was to put the money in the banking sector, write off the loans. We cannot really afford that right now,” he said.

The author of “Good Economics for Hard Times” said that the slowdown in the economy will also adversely impact poverty alleviation in the country as urban and rural sectors are interdependent.

“Poverty alleviation has been happening mostly on the strength of the fact that urban sector creates low skill jobs, and a lot of rural sector works in the urban sector and sends money back. That's the peak source of transmission of growth from urban sector to rural sector. And as soon as the urban sector slows down the rural sector, the people in construction work don't have as many jobs. All of that will feed back on the rural sector,” said Banerjee.

Growing cynicism of the government is also not good for the country, Banerjee said explaining why this will not help people in electing the people on merits.

Referring to one of his projects in Uttar Pradesh covering 200 villages some years ago, he said, ""As part of the experiment, we told the people to vote on development issues and not on caste lines. That was the message delivered through a set of puppet shows, posters and songs. We did not talk about who to vote for; all we said was vote well. We found that 10% people were less likely to vote on caste lines.""

He said excessive cynicism pf the politicians will force people to lose trust in them even though all of them are not corrupt. Banerjee said if people believe that all the politicians are corrupt then they will fall into the same trap of casteism because a known candidate from the community will be preferred one even if he does not deserve that trust on merit.

Thiruvananthapuram: Police have arrested six more alleged land mafia members for the murder of Sangeeth, 37, of Kattakkada. The six were identified as Linu, 30, of Kuzhivila Veedu, Kollamkonam near Peyyad; Mithun, 25, of Koovalassery near Maranalloor; Stalin John alias Saju, 48, of Thoongampara near Maranalloor; Uthaman alias Manikandan, 34, of Keezhumachel near Ambalathinkala; Lal Kumar alias Unni of Chemboor near Ottasekharamangalam; and, Vineesh alias Thenga Aneesh, 26 of Vellangal near Ottasekharamangalam.

Vijin, 24, who operated the earthmover which was used to fatally injure Sangeeth was arrested earlier and remanded into judicial custody on Saturday. One more accused, identified as Baiju, is still absconding. The accused were presented in court on Monday evening and subsequently remanded into judicial custody.

Speaking at a news conference at Kattakkada on Monday evening, Thiruvananthapuram Rural SP B Asokan said that while Vijin, Linu, Saju, Uthaman, Mithun and Baiju were present at the crime scene, Lal Kumar and Vineesh were arrested for aiding the accused. “A probe is on to track down Baiju. Investigations have revealed that both the tipper and earthmover hit Sangeeth. The accused revealed that they killed Sangeeth after he confronted them and warned them of imminent police action. Fearing arrest and confiscation of their vehicles, they tried to flee. Sangeeth was murdered as he had blocked their path. The tipper first hit him but he stood his ground. The earthmover’s rear bucket was then used to crush Sangeeth against the compound wall,” he said.

The tipper, which was driven by Linu, is owned by Uthaman. Vijin operated the earthmover which is owned by Saju.

Nedumangad DSP Stuart Keeler said the postmortem report revealed multiple injuries to Sangeeth’s ribs and head. “Three ribs on both sides of his body had multiple fractures which were caused when he was crushed between the earthmover and the compound wall,” the DSP said.

SP Asokan said that a probe, by DSP Keeler, will also go into negligence on the part of the police, who had allegedly arrived more than an hour after Sangeeth had alerted them. “The Nedumangad DSP is already probing the alleged apathy. Strict action will be taken against officers who were on duty if the report confirms any sort of passivity. The gang had moved around five loads of earth on the same day, ahead of the murder. A truck owned by Saju had been confiscated by SHO Bijukumar in December for mining without a permit. They will also be booked for theft, along with murder,” he said.

The JCB which was traced to Saju’s old stone quarry at Kuzhalar near Mulayamkodu, Kattakkada and the tipper which was found inside a cement brick factory at Mepala in Tamil Nadu have been confiscated. Finger print and scientific analyses revealed that both vehicles were used to to hit Sangeeth. Lal Kumar and Vineesh arranged the hideouts for the vehicles and also booked the lodge rooms at Thriparappu where Uthaman, Linu and Midhun stayed after the crime.

Thiruvananthapuram: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has sent another missive to external affairs minister S Jaishankar to persuade Nepal government ‘to order a thorough inquiry ’ into the tragic incident which killed eight tourists from Kerala and ‘to provide a suitable monetary compensation to the families of the victims’.

The CM had sent a letter in this regard to the Union minister on January 20. “It is now reported that the deaths have happened due to malfunctioning of equipment in the room where these persons were staying. Their untimely death has been a severe blow to their families. Prima facie, it is clear that there has been negligence on the part of the service providers and there appears to be failure of regulatory mechanisms which ought to have been in place,” the CM in his letter sent on Sunday.

Meanwhile, tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran said on Monday that the attitude of the Indian embassy in Nepal and the management of the resort where the ill-fated holiday team from Kerala stayed was ‘shocking and very disturbing’.

“The attitude of the Nepal government too has been very disturbing. The government (Nepal) hasn’t started any probe into this tragedy and the resort management has not even considered about compensating the families of victims,” the minister told reporters here on Monday. What was even more disturbing was the stand taken by the Indian embassy in Nepal which wasn’t ready to bear the expenses of transporting the mortal remains, he said.

Citing the Nepal tragedy and the recent Alappuzha houseboat accident, Kadakampally stressed the need for a proper regulatory mechanism.

UN Goodwill Ambassador Dia Mirza

Climate emergency was one of the inaugural sessions of the last day of the Jaipur Literature Festival which touched upon some important issues, including that climate change is a reality and human induced environmental change.

The session had a panelists comprising of author Shubhangi Swarup, United Nations representative Renata Dessallien, reformist Sonam Wangchuk , Chief Executive at Aga Khan Rural Support Programme Apoorva Oza, novelist Namita Waikar and UN Goodwill Ambassador Dia Mirza in conversation with moderator Samir Saran.

While Mirza was visibly emotional on the dias and could not hold back her tears over a personal grief, the other panelist spoke at length about the reality of climate change. “The seriousness of climate change is too important for it to be not believed and though UN is not a global police, we try to bring the nations together to address this issue but it appears that we are failing miserably. We are getting to the point that the scientists are telling us that it might actually be too late. We are also a long way away from reducing human induced climate change”, said Dessallien.

The panelist also lamented that political borders are ‘ridiculous’ and there is ‘unbearable inequality’ in this world today which also lends to climate change. Environmental representation was also a topic which was talked about during the session.

“We should have seats reserved for ‘nature representatives’ in the parliament and a look at our education system also needs to be taken as at present, though the system teaches about the deforestation, it does not teach the other way around,” added Wangchuk.

The panelists also emphasised on the fact that every small effort to curb climate change counts which has to be done continuously along with the fact that ancient wisdom and practices go a long way in teaching and helping to prevent climate change.

Navroz Dubash

The fact that this year’s Jaipur Literature Festival had three panels on or around climate change demonstrates how this issue has finally begun to preoccupy everyone, the public and governments included. Now, however, comes the hard part – doing something about it. Because, civilisation now comes with a sell-by date.

In the session, ‘Uninhabitable Earth’, on day four of JLF, panelists spoke about the policy, politics and psychology of climate change. “We’re all living in unprecedented times. For as long as humans have walked the earth, the planet has never been as warm as it is today,” revealed David Wallace-Wells , author of a work (‘Uninhabitable Earth’) that has injected urgency into the conversation on climate change. “It’s like we’ve landed on a new planet, with a new climate.”

In other words, humans must accept that much of the life of old can no longer be saved, and that a new world would have to rise from the ashes of the old – literally, in the case of Australia. “We need to have a sense of urgency but our actions shouldn’t result in a global, North-South blame game.”

According to Navroz Dubash , a professor at the Centre for Policy Research who has researched and written extensively on climate change, what is different today is the pace and scale of the changes, which very few had predicted. “We have to think of development in the context of a warming world,” he informed.

Of course, climate change is also impacting our psyches; some of us would rather not think about it. “There is a paralysis at the level of policy makers and citizens. And there’s also a defensive pushback, where people are saying, ‘It’s not a problem of our making, we don’t have to deal with it’,” explained Wallace-Wells, who admitted he’s happy to be alarmist.

“We need to focus not on climate denial but on climate complacency. I woke up to this issue out of fear, and we can use this language to talk about climate change.”

Yet, hope floats. Through its wind farms, Texas, a traditionally conservative state, is playing its part in promoting sustainable initiatives. “There has to be innovation, in how people move and how they live,” shared Marcus Moench, who has for 38 years spoken and written on adaptability to climate change.

It is, stressed Wallace-Wells, about making the right choices today, so that future generations can live in a world that’s more inhabitable than the one we are leaving behind. “We’re at a consequential hinge point in humanity, and we must take dramatic action both in terms of decarbonisation and creating a resilient social infrastructure.”

It is also about encouraging behavioural change, at the level of individuals and, also, of institutions. “It’s not about changing the trajectory of development, it’s about a deeper change; how we live, what our footprint is,” maintained Moench. Maybe we could start by handing over charge to women. For, as Moench asked: What has an all-male dialogue achieved in the last four decades?

CHENNAI/MUMBAI: The demand for N95 masks in China, where people continue to walk with the nose and mouth covered to protect themselves against the coronavirus , is making Indian manufacturers and dealers of the special safety gear smile. It has also led to an increase in cost by at least 50%.With common disposable surgical masks considered ineffective against large, infectious particles, experts are asking people at risk — health workers and care givers — to use the N95. “But many in China are wearing it. N95 offers better protection by filtering out small particles,” said Manoj Vakharia, treasurer of Scientific and Surgical Dealers and Manufacturers Association (SIDMA). “Now, instead of importing from China, many dealers here are exporting them to that country.”With China limiting exports, many Asian countries are now approaching Indian dealers. “We are sending boxes of masks we bought from China. Apart from this we are procuring fresh ones directly from manufacturers here,” said Anil Gupta of Mumbai-based Avishankar International Private Limited.On Monday, several Indian manufacturers hiked prices. “Dealers here used to buy N95 masks at Rs 25 a piece. Now, it is at least Rs 38. Some other varieties such as N95plus are sold at a much higher price. Manufacturers are also demanding that we pay 100% money in advance,” said Chennai-based J Jayaseelan, chairman of Indian Drug Manufacturers Association.Corporates placing orders have just two demands — the masks should be National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-certified and delivered in a week.

The campaign aims to mobilise people to push political parties beyond manifesto promises.

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the February 8 elections, hundreds of people gathered in various parts of the capital on Monday to demand action for clean air from political representatives.

Under the banner of NGO Chintan’s Safai Sena and #DilliDhadakneDo by My Right to Breathe, a civil society movement, people from several assembly constituencies have started a series of town halls to make political parties accountable. On Monday, Jangpura, Matia Mahal, Badli, Karawal Nagar, RK Puram and Delhi Cantonment were covered and each town hall was attended by representatives of AAP, BJP and Congress.

The campaign aims to mobilise people to push political parties beyond manifesto promises. The events at RK Puram, Karawal Nagar and Delhi Cantonment were followed by a march and a rally of around 300 e-rickshaws for cleaner technologies.

Chitra Mukherjee, head of programmes and operations at Chintan, said they had been receiving positive responses from the parties. At Jangpura, sitting AAP MLA Praveen Kumar promised, “We will strengthen public transport more. We also need to clamp down further on garbage burning.”

Vighnesh Jha of Federation of Rickshaw Puller Association said at Karawal Nagar, “We are most exposed to air pollution and urge our members to vote for those who will work to improve Delhi’s air.” Rekha Jhingan of NGO Sahaj Sambhav said at Delhi Cantonment, “Women, especially young mothers like me, demand parties take concrete steps to safeguard the health of younger generations.”

NEW DELHI: Union water resources minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat mocked Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia for giving reasons why people get bad quality water in the capital.In a tweet, Shekhawat tagged a video in which Sisodia was seen explaining why people get dirty water when they switch on booster motors, particularly during the ‘no-supply’ period. “When questions relating to bad quality water were asked to the education minister, he started referring to physics. This is beyond anyone’s understanding. He started talking about the timing of switching on booster motors and the science of drawing water when he was confronted with questions. The CM had promised to ensure supply of good quality water within a year of coming to power,” Shekhawat tweeted.In September, he had claimed that Delhi’s water quality was better than European standards, which had kicked off a controversy within Delhi BJP. CM Arvind Kejriwal, who is also the DJB chief, had welcomed the statement. But in November, Union consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan had announced the test results of water samples collected from 21 cities which showed that Delhi’s piped water was the worst on quality parameters. “Now people of Delhi also accept that the water supplied by DJB is unsafe for drinking...I wish that every household receives water by 2024 under Jal Jeevan Mission, which complies with BIS norms,” Paswan said.",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73688693,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-735593,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi-assembly-elections/shekhawat-does-a-u-turn-targets-aap-on-water-quality/articleshow/73677246.cms

Thiruvananthapuram: Officers of the Cyber Crime police station arrested a 49-year-old man from Visakhapatnam in connection with an alleged case of online fraud and cheating of a businessman.

The accused has been identified as Kurmana Kameshwara Rao of Jalari Peta of Visakhapatnam. The prime accused in the cheating case, identified as Vadalamani Ravi Sankar, was arrested back in December 1, but Rao was on the run until he was tracked down by a team of officers led by Cyber Crime station house officer DSP Jeeji N on Friday. The accused was presented before the court and subsequently remanded into judicial custody on Monday.

According to an officer attached to the Cyber Crime police station, the investigation based on mobile tower location revealed that the accused was in Visakhapatnam.

“The complainant, who is the owner of Naveen Agencies in Alappuzha, noticed an online advertisement offering steel bars at low prices and approached the accused. He then placed an order worth Rs 9,80,425 after contacting prime accused Vadalamani Ravi Sankar. After receiving the money, Sankar sent contact numbers of Rao who was introduced as the driver of the truck carrying the load. But, the shipment failed to reach the complainant. The complainant then contacted Rao, who further demanded and took Rs 75,000 for fixing the damages of the truck and Rs 35,000 for treatment of the co-driver who had allegedly fallen to dengue. The complainant paid the money,” the officer said.

Even after several days of making the payment, the load failed to reach Alappuzha, prompting the businessman to file a complaint at the Cyber Crime station here.

The officer also said that probe is still on to track down others who are involved in the online scam. “Sankar was tracked down from his hideout near Nishita Complex, West Bengal, on December 1 and was subsequently presented to the court and remanded in judicial custody. Enquiry about Rao has also revealed that there were several other cases registered against him in various police stations of Vishakapatnam. We have also recovered bank account books, sim cards and phone, with details of transactions from the accused,” he said.

The team under DIG Sanjay Kumar Guruddin, led by DSP Jeeji N, also comprised of Cyber Crime inspector Roj R, sub-inspector Bijukumar, civil police officers Sabarinath and Sreeraj. They travelled to Visakhapatnam and made the arrest.

Thiruvananthapuram: Giving thrust to more women-centric policing initiatives as part of observing 2020 as the year of women safety, state police chief Loknath Behera has asked all range DIGs to set up at least one all-women crime investigation wing and entrust them with investigation of some major crime cases, in which women victims are involved.

In his circular issued last Thursday to all the district police chiefs, range DIGs and zonal IGs, the state police chief asked the DIGs to draw a competent woman inspector from a unit in their range and form a team of women officers under the officer. They will be entrusted with some serious cases registered for atrocities against women and children in the jurisdiction. “According to the workload, the size of a range team should be fixed. DIG shall be the motivator and supervisor of the team. Continuous training for them will be required and should be ensured by the DIG concerned,” the circular said. For such teams, the training will be provided either at the Kerala Police Academy at Thrissur or police training college in the capital.

A state-level committee led by ADGP (training) B Sandhya has also been set up to supervise all women-police related projects and initiatives. The team also includes SP (ICT) Divya V Gopinath, DCP (Kochi) R Poonguzhali, commandant (women’s battalion) D Shilpa and ASP (Shanghumugham) Aishwarya Dongre. The committee has been asked to monitor and supervise all programs and furnish a monthly progress report to the state police chief.

As the police also feels that visibility of women police in public spaces will have a telling effect on the safety of women, a team of two women police officers should visit busy public spaces where there is presence of women, like bus stops, bus stands, market places, school and college premises etc., four times in the day especially in the morning and evening hours. In the night, such visits should be accompanied by one male police officer too, the circular said. The team should interact with school and college girls about sexual harassment, stalking or threatening, so as to ensure their safety and instil confidence in them. A group of 30 women officers should be trained and deployed for each district, the police chief instructed.

NEW DELHI: The candidates fielded by the three major political parties for the February 8 polls may be richer in terms of wealth compared with the 2015 assembly elections, but they are certainly poorer when it comes to education. In 2015, as many as 48 of the 70 candidates fielded by AAP had a graduation degree or higher. This time, the number of such candidates has come down to 39. Also, 31 AAP candidates were graduates and 17 had a Master’s degree in the previous election. This time, there are 20 graduate candidates and 19 post-graduates.Similarly, the number of BJP candidates who are graduates or have a higher qualification has come down from 47 to 39. In 2015, there were 28 graduates among BJP candidates, apart from 14 who had a post-graduation degree. Five were PhD holders. This time, there are 27 graduates and 12 Master’s degree holders among the candidates fielded by BJP and its allies LJP and JD(U).Complete Coverage on Delhi ElectionsCongress, however, has bucked the trend. The number of its candidates and those of its ally, Rashtriya Janata Dal , who are graduates or higher, is 45 against 39 in 2015. They include 26 graduates, 19 with a Master’s degree and four PhD holders. In 2015, Congress had fielded 28 graduates, nine PG degree holders and two who had PhD.On the other hand, the number of AAP candidates who have studied up to Class X or less has gone up from eight to 12. The number of XIIth pass candidates has gone up from 13 to 19. In case of BJP, the number of candidates who have studied up to Class Xth or less has gone down from 18 in 2015 to 11. But number of Class XIIth pass candidates has gone up from four to 18. In case of Congress, the number has gone down from 20 to nine in the former case and is up from 11 to 15 in the latter.The information provided by candidates in their affidavits throws up some interesting facts. Humanities appears to be the stream of choice for most hopefuls. As many as 45 have a Bachelor of Arts degree. While most have opted for a “Pass” course, those who have done “Honours” have largely gone for political science.Commerce is the second most preferred stream with 13 candidates having a Bachelor of Commerce degree, followed by just six candidates who are science graduates and have done BSc. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj have engineering backgrounds.Law is another favourite subject. There are seven who have done Bachelor of Law (LLB) and four Master of Law (LLM). Nine candidates pursued graduation or post-graduation in different streams, but later went on to earn an LLB degree too.

NEW DELHI: The candidates fielded by the three major political parties for the February 8 polls may be richer in terms of wealth compared with the 2015 assembly elections, but they are certainly poorer when it comes to education. In 2015, as many as 48 of the 70 candidates fielded by AAP had a graduation degree or higher. This time, the number of such candidates has come down to 39. Also, 31 AAP candidates were graduates and 17 had a Master’s degree in the previous election. This time, there are 20 graduate candidates and 19 post-graduates.Similarly, the number of BJP candidates who are graduates or have a higher qualification has come down from 47 to 39. In 2015, there were 28 graduates among BJP candidates, apart from 14 who had a post-graduation degree. Five were PhD holders. This time, there are 27 graduates and 12 Master’s degree holders among the candidates fielded by BJP and its allies LJP and JD(U).Congress, however, has bucked the trend. The number of its candidates and those of its ally, Rashtriya Janata Dal , who are graduates or higher, is 45 against 39 in 2015. They include 26 graduates, 19 with a Master’s degree and four PhD holders. In 2015, Congress had fielded 28 graduates, nine PG degree holders and two who had PhD.On the other hand, the number of AAP candidates who have studied up to Class X or less has gone up from eight to 12. The number of XIIth pass candidates has gone up from 13 to 19. In case of BJP, the number of candidates who have studied up to Class Xth or less has gone down from 18 in 2015 to 11. But number of Class XIIth pass candidates has gone up from four to 18. In case of Congress, the number has gone down from 20 to nine in the former case and is up from 11 to 15 in the latter.The information provided by candidates in their affidavits throws up some interesting facts. Humanities appears to be the stream of choice for most hopefuls. As many as 45 have a Bachelor of Arts degree. While most have opted for a “Pass” course, those who have done “Honours” have largely gone for political science.Commerce is the second most preferred stream with 13 candidates having a Bachelor of Commerce degree, followed by just six candidates who are science graduates and have done BSc. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj have engineering backgrounds.Law is another favourite subject. There are seven who have done Bachelor of Law (LLB) and four Master of Law (LLM). Nine candidates pursued graduation or post-graduation in different streams, but later went on to earn an LLB degree too. Among those who have a Master’s degree, most (20) have pursued humanities, followed by nine with a Master of Business Administration degree. Six candidates have completed MSc and three others MCom. Four PhD holders are in the fray this time compared with seven in 2015. There are also six doctors, including three with a Master of Surgery degree.The title of the most qualified candidate may go to Naresh Kumar (58) of Congress.

Secunderabad: With GHMC constructing eight FoBs in Secunderabad zone, TOI asked readers to suggest other areas that needed measures to reduce the traffic snarls

Secunderabad junctions are choking due to excess traffic and poor management. Every junction including Jubilee bus stop, Patny, Paradise and NTR statue need improvement works. The poor placement of bus bays, inaction on auto rickshaws parked illegally, unwanted speed breakers, lack of footpaths, complete absence of subways in the city, improper streetlights and dysfunctional signals and unclean urinals are just some of the issues that need to be tackled.

The GHMC and Secunderabad Cantonment Board needs to work together corporation to address these issues. There is a need for a complete overhaul of the road and sewage in the city. We need more public transport to bring down the traffic. Authorities and citizens need to work together to solve the civic issues in the city.

Deepesh Surana

The road from Yellareddyguda Saibaba temple cross road towards Anuraag Special school, Janapriya Silver Crest villas and Kapra lake is in very bad condition. Many school buses and ambulances pass through this road that is full of potholes. Is GHMC not responsible for the proper upkeep of roads. We will be highly grateful if the road is repaired. Hope GHMC wakes up and give instructions to the concerned officials to take up this issue at the earliest before any untoward accidents happen on the road.

Dakshina Murthy Shanker

The density of traffic is very high near Sangeet crossroads, Patny, Paradise and Chilakalguda junctions making it is difficult to cross the road. Invariably, women and senior citizens are seen taking help from police to cross the road. Due to continuous movement of vehicles throughout the day, people are constantly worried about crossing the road. Authorities must take up construction of skyways at these junctions on priority. Similarly, FoBs must be constructed at accident prone junctions at New Bhoiguda and Boats club junction. Authorities must conduct a survey and decide the exact spot for construction of skyways.

K.R.Srinivasan

It is indeed a great news that GHMC is planning to construct FOBs and skywalks for the convenience of the public. There are many roads which need this facility. Begumpet Khairatabad, Rajbhavan, Irraum Manzil, Punjagutta and Masab Tank road need improvement works. FoBs and footpaths are also needed in Basheerbagh and Himayat Nagar. Footpaths are being encroached and this needs to be addressed.

Dr GV Kumar

At Suchitra junction, pedestrians are facing lot of difficulties due to heavy traffic at junction point and needs FOB to mitigate public sufferings. Initiate action for a FOB at Suchitra junction early -- Simhadri Ch

Thank you for proposing a FOB at Neredmet cross. Much needed. Please consider a FOB on Karkhana road near Mcdonalds. Crossing that road is a suicide mission. @KTRTRS @CommissionrGHMC @greensainikpuri @molfe2000 -- Deepa Shailender

402,['28/01/2020'],IUML cadres join LDF’s human chain,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Kozhikode: Embarrassing the UDF leadership, a section of IUML workers participated in the human chain formed by the LDF against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ) on Republic Day.

To make matters worse for the UDF, the E K faction of the Sunnis, who are the traditional vote bank for the Front, also took part in the programme.

Prominent among the IUML cadres was K M Basheer, vice-president of the party’s Beypore mandalam. He told media persons on Monday that he joined the protest as the LDF was showing more sincerity in agitations.

Basheer said that the Left parties succeeded in understanding the importance of the issue and acted accordingly. The Congress thoroughly failed in this regard, he said.

He added that in the present scenario Congress cannot become an alternative to the BJP at the national level. A joint fight by the secular forces, including the Left, is the need of the hour. Basheer also praised chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan for leading the anti-CAA agitations. “The declaration the chief minister made that CAA will not be implemented in Kerala is a great relief for the Muslim community,” Basheer said, adding that KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran is speaking in the language of an ordinary politician about a crucial issue.

E K group sources told TOI that they have announced that they would join anyone in the fight against the CAA.

The feeling that at least a section of the Muslim community is cozying up to the Left has given heartburn to the UDF leadership. There is already a buzz in the Muslim community that something is lacking in the UDF agitations against the CAA.

K Muraleedhran, MP, said the IUML cadres participating in the LDF programme is a serious issue. He said he had spoken to the opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala on the issue. “The programme UDF organised in Kozhikode last week was a grand success. We need more such programmes in future,” he said.

IUML has sought to downplay the development, saying that it is a non-issue and cautioning that such trivial controversies will only help the BJP.

In a statement issued here, IUML state general secretary K P A Majeed said it was the decision of the coordination committee of Muslim organizations that everyone should participate in common programmes against the CAA.

But it was difficult for the UDF to join the human chain because the programme was unilaterally announced by the LDF, Majeed said.

403,['28/01/2020'],Tamil Nadu: Rs 3 lakh can get you a doctorate without research,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Representative image

CHENNAI: Who says you need critical thinking and academic acumen to earn a PhD? You can order a doctorate with just a phone call. The cartels that employ ghost writers no more operate on the sly. They’ve set it up like restaurants – there’s a menu and what you pay depends on what you order.

Tamil Nadu produced the maximum number of PhDs in the country, 5,844, in 2018, according to All India Survey for Higher Education 2019. There is a renewed interest among faculty members to publish research papers and complete doctorates due to the Union HRD ministry’s decision to make PhD mandatory for the entry-level post of assistant professor from July 2021, and give more weightage for research work in National Institute Ranking Framework rankings and National Assessment and Accreditation Council ratings.

The spike in research interest has made the ground fertile for ghost writers and agents who have branded themselves consultancy services. Scholars and research guides TOI spoke to said they received calls from unknown people offering ‘help’ in doing research. TOI picked the trail of one such message to uncover how a racket has been functioning in a sophisticated but brazen manner.

Posing as a faculty member from a private engineering college, this correspondent called the agent. He promptly asked about the area of research and topic before quoting a price. He offered to do engineering research, analyse data and publish a paper in an annexure-1 journal for Rs 1.2 lakh. For converting research into an article and publishing it in the journal he quoted Rs 80,000.

“If you can do research and only need help in publication, it will cost Rs 45,000. But, your research should be complete research with analysis, data and graphics. You should take responsibility if the paper is rejected or needs clarification from journal editors,” he said.

Asked about outsourcing thesis work, the agent said, “If you have the literature review, research work, article, output and analysis, we will charge `65,000 to write the thesis. If you have nothing, then it would cost around Rs 3 lakh. We will do the research, get the article published and write the thesis.”

The agent said a team of professors does the research for money. His ‘agency’ is helping scholars across universities. “The rate will be finalised after seeing the university guidelines. We collect the highest rate for Anna University PhDs,” he said.

The payment is in installments. “We will collect registration fee initially and take full payment after the acceptance by the research journal. For example, we will take Rs 10,000 as initial payment for publication and update you about the research. You can make corrections. We will take the next installment after your corrections,” he said.

Faculty members TOI spoke to confirmed that outsourcing research work is a trend thriving in arts and science colleges, and technical colleges.

“It has become mandatory to publish research papers for increments. Journals take up to a year to accept an article or even to respond. So faculty members opt to publish research papers by paying money. When we pay money, even some of the listed journals respond within a day confirming publication without any proper peer review,” said a faculty member from an arts and science college in the city.

Professors from University of Madras said one of the reasons why such rackets flourish is because students without research aptitude enrolled for PhDs.

Professor M K Surappa, vice-chancellor of Anna University, said the practice was “unethical and devoid of all morality”. “Research is a passion and not a routine degree. This is perhaps one of the reasons why our country is not able to produce high quality research publications in sufficient numbers,” he said. To deter such PhDs, Anna University has introduced minimum eligibility marks in entrance exam for aspirants. This brought down the number of PhD candidates from 2,527 in 2018 to 908 in 2019.

University of Madras has introduced measures to enhance the quality of PhD thesis in the past two years. “All theses have to pass through a plagiarism detecting software. There is a new online system to trace the progress of research work very closely. A first year candidate has to present a paper in at least one national-level conference and in the second year one conference and one publication, and it continues for the third year also. If the candidate meets these requirements then he or she can prepare the thesis,” said P Duraisamy, vice-chancellor.

Homeguards stage protest on Monday

BHOPAL: Around 2,000 homeguards reached homeguard Lines near Police Control Room in Jehangirabad on Monday morning and staged a protest to press for their demands. Heavy police force was deployed in the area and barricading was done to divert the traffic. Senior officers, including DIG Irshad Wali and district collector Tarun Pithode, reached the spot and monitored the situation from control room.

After talks failed between the protestors and district administration and the former refused to withdraw their agitation, police filed FIRs against them for obstructing road traffic.

Several attempts made during the day by senior police officers to persuade the protesters, failed. The jawans did not even allow any senior homeguard official to enter the protest area. They were demanding that the word ‘volunteer’ be removed from their post and they should be provided the facilities given to state government employees. Jawans also demanded that the process of enrolment after every three years should be abolished and the mandatory medical examination by medical board after every 10 months be stopped. They also demanded that rotation system, which includes two months’ compulsory end to service after every 11 months, should also be stopped.

The protest ended around 7.30 pm when the senior homeguard officers called a 10-member delegation of protesters and counselled them to file a proper application, stating their demands so that higher authorities can look into the matter. The officers instructed the jawans to reach their respective duties on Tuesday without fail, else disciplinary action will be taken against them. The delegation handed over six memorandums to the officials, later the jawans dispersed.

NEW DELHI: With an eye on over 2 million Dalit voters in the city, Bahujan Samaj Party is in the poll fray for 68 assembly seats after the nomination papers of two of its candidates (for Ghonda and Mundka) were rejected. In the 70-seat Delhi assembly, 12 are reserved. While the party has largely been ignored in the city’s popular political discourse, its vote share of 15% in 2008 was higher than what Congress secured in the 2015 assembly elections (9.8%).In 2008, BSP won two seats — Gokalpur and Badarpur.The dozen reserved seats, which have a sizeable population of Dalit voters, can make or mar the prospects of other parties. The performance of BSP, therefore, could play a vital role in the bigger picture. Since 2008, however, the Mayawati-led party has failed to make a dent in Delhi. In 2015, it fought for all 70 seats, but failed to win any, and ended with a meagre 1.3% vote share. In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the party failed to win even a single seat in Uttar Pradesh, a reflection of its dwindling political fortunes.In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, it won 10 seats in UP and the party is hoping for a similar revival of sorts in Delhi. In the 2008 assembly elections, BSP came second in five Delhi seats; in 2013, though it didn’t win any seat, it held on to the second spot in five. Mayawati is likely to address a convention in the capital on February 3, which Delhi BSP functionary M L Tomar said, could boost the morale of the party workers. According to party sources, Mayawati may also visit Shaheen Bagh.BSP candidate for Badarpur, Narayan Dutt Sharma, who had won on an AAP ticket in 2015, is running an intensive campaign in the segment where a four-cornered fight is being seen. AAP has fielded former MLA Ram Singh Netaji, while BJP has gone for ex-MLA Ramvir Singh Bidhuri. Congress has nominated a fresh face in Pramod Kumar Yadav.Sitting independent councillor from Sangam Vihar (A), Suresh Choudhary , is contesting on a BSP ticket in Sangam Vihar. There too, a four-cornered fight is expected. BJP has left this seat for JD(U), AAP has fielded its sitting MLA, Dinesh Mohaniya, and Congress has nominated a Poorvanchali in Poonam Azad, wife of Delhi Congress campaign committee chairman Kirti Azad.

BHOPAL: A 12-year-old child, who refused to back out of a Republic Day parade despite being unwell, fell unconscious after the march past and died on the way to hospital.

Ayush Pandey studied in Class VII in a government school in Umaria’s Birsinghpour Palli town. The cause of death isn’t known, and may never be known because the doctors who declared Ayush dead did not inform police about the need for an autopsy. The child was cremated on Sunday night.

Police have found that Ayush was feeling unwell on Sunday morning but insisted on going to the event because he was the parade commander of his school. Ayush held himself together until the parade at the town stadium was over, and then collapsed, say sources.

His family took him to Shahdol district hospital, about 40km away, but he was declared dead on arrival. Police say the body was handed over to his parents without autopsy as no case was registered.

Shahdol civil surgeon Vikrant Baria said, “The child was dead when brought here from Umaria. The parents took away the body.” Asked if post-mortem was conducted, he said: “It was not done here. I am not aware if it was done in Umaria.”

Pali police station in-charge Rajesh Chand Mishra said, “We investigated the incident and found that the child was sick that day. Even his teachers asked him not to participate in the parade, but since he had prepared for it, he insisted. After participating, he fell unconscious and was taken to Shahdol by his parents, but since the autopsy wasn’t done, no case has been registered.” Police will take action if they get a complaint, he added.

Anna University

CHENNAI: Anna University regulations in 2013 allowed a professor to guide up to 12 research scholars at a time (the number is 11 now). But M Rajaram guided 19 research scholars simultaneously from 2013 to 2016 when he was holding office as vice-chancellor, according to a reply to an RTI query .

Anna University’s PhD regulations do not bar a vice-chancellor from guiding research students, but there is conflict of interest, say academicians. The vice-chancellor chooses the examiners to evaluate thesis and conduct viva-voce for doctoral candidates.

This is just the tip of the iceberg, say professors, asking how it’s possible to guide 19 research scholars while holding a top academic post in a university?

“It is unethical to guide research scholars after becoming a vice-chancellor. Besides, he wouldn’t have time to guide so many research scholars while heading a large technical university,” said E Balagurusamy, former vice-chancellor, Anna University.

Professor Rajaram denied all allegations. “There is no bar on a vice-chancellor guiding researchers. I have not taken any student after becoming vice-chancellor. All my PhD students completed research after proper publication,” Rajaram told TOI. He said some of his students had published papers in top journals like IEEE.

On allegations that he guided scholars in other streams such as computer science engineering and held a closed viva-voce for his students, Rajaram said, “As a professor in electrical and electronics engineering, I can guide students from all circuit branches. My students have defended their thesis in public viva voce and university has records for attendance of public.”

But his critics are not convinced. They say even a full-time research guide cannot supervise more than 10 scholars. According to UGC’s shodhganga website, Rajaram conducted viva voce for 43 students as guide between 2013 and 2019. The data shows Rajaram had more than 12 Anna University research scholars, which is a violation of university rules.

Raising doubts about the research data and originality of the theses, several professors demanded a committee be set up to investigate the issue.

“If there is sufficient proof and evidence of plagiarism, fake data in theses submitted by his research scholars, the university will initiate action,” said M K Surappa, vice-chancellor of Anna University.

Local bodies have also been directed to put in place permanent/temporary measures to stop discharge of sewage ... Read More

LUCKNOW: While chief minister Yogi Adityanath kicked off the Ganga Yatra on Monday, the state urban development department has pushed in a slew of measures, including total ban on the use of polythene in local bodies through which the yatra would pass.

As per the directive issued by the department, Ganga Yatra would cover 21 local bodies in 26 districts. These would include three municipal corporations, 12 nagar palika parishad and six nagar panchayats.

The notification issued by principal secretary, urban development, Manoj Kumar Singh directed all local bodies to ensure the ban on use of plastics. Directives have been issued to ensure strict enforcement of ban on single use plastics, Singh told TOI.

“The idea is to ensure that no plastic flows into the Ganga during the yatra,” said a senior official in the urban development department. Ganga Yatra would be kicked off simultaneously from Gram Sabalgarh in Bijnor and village Kondhara Naubrar in Ballia, close to Bihar border.

The government had issued a notification in July 2018 banning use of polythene with thickness less than 50 micron. The ban on polythene comes after the department directed local bodies to be made open defecation free (ODF) during the course of yatra which would cover 205km every day. Local bodies have also been directed to put in place permanent/temporary measures to stop discharge of sewage and drain water into the Ganga. At the same time, management of solid waste will also have to be ensured till the conclusion of Ganga Yatra on January 31.

410,['28/01/2020'],"Delhi assembly polls: BSP to fight for 68 seats, here’s why it’s a factor","This story is from January 28, 2020

Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati

NEW DELHI: With an eye on over 2 million Dalit voters in the city, Bahujan Samaj Party is in the poll fray for 68 assembly seats after the nomination papers of two of its candidates (for Ghonda and Mundka) were rejected. In the 70-seat Delhi assembly, 12 are reserved. While the party has largely been ignored in the city’s popular political discourse, its vote share of 15% in 2008 was higher than what Congress secured in the 2015 assembly elections (9.8%).

In 2008, BSP won two seats — Gokalpur and Badarpur.

The dozen reserved seats, which have a sizeable population of Dalit voters, can make or mar the prospects of other parties. The performance of BSP, therefore, could play a vital role in the bigger picture. Since 2008, however, the Mayawati-led party has failed to make a dent in Delhi. In 2015, it fought for all 70 seats, but failed to win any, and ended with a meagre 1.3% vote share. In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the party failed to win even a single seat in Uttar Pradesh, a reflection of its dwindling political fortunes.

Complete coverage on Delhi elections

In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, it won 10 seats in UP and the party is hoping for a similar revival of sorts in Delhi. In the 2008 assembly elections, BSP came second in five Delhi seats; in 2013, though it didn’t win any seat, it held on to the second spot in five.

Mayawati is likely to address a convention in the capital on February 3, which Delhi BSP functionary M L Tomar said, could boost the morale of the party workers. According to party sources, Mayawati may also visit Shaheen Bagh.

BSP candidate for Badarpur, Narayan Dutt Sharma, who had won on an AAP ticket in 2015, is running an intensive campaign in the segment where a four-cornered fight is being seen. AAP has fielded former MLA Ram Singh Netaji, while BJP has gone for ex-MLA Ramvir Singh Bidhuri. Congress has nominated a fresh face in Pramod Kumar Yadav.

Sitting independent councillor from Sangam Vihar (A), Suresh Choudhary , is contesting on a BSP ticket in Sangam Vihar. There too, a four-cornered fight is expected. BJP has left this seat for JD(U), AAP has fielded its sitting MLA, Dinesh Mohaniya, and Congress has nominated a Poorvanchali in Poonam Azad, wife of Delhi Congress campaign committee chairman Kirti Azad. In Delhi Cantonment, BSP is betting on Nand Kishor Beniwal , a member of Delhi Cantonment Board Council. “Dalit voters are with BSP candidates in all seats,” Tomar said.

Thiruvananthapuram: Two shared-auto mobility corridors are being considered by Smart City Thiruvananthapuram Ltd (SCTL) ahead of the launch of the city’s first shared-auto scheme under the Smart City project.

As many as 15 e-rickshaws will ply to and fro along the Thampanoor-Overbridge-Secretariat-Legislative Assembly-Museum-Public Office-Manaveeyam stretch and Thampanoor-Overbridge-Gandhi Park-Pazhavangadi-Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple stretch. The corridors are being analysed for possible demand for commute from railway station and bus stand to offices and places of tourist attraction and religious significance.

The city corporation has submitted a list of 14 women licence-holders to be part of the e-rickshaw scheme. Both e-autos and e-rickshaws will be driven by women beneficiaries.

The corporation and SCTL have also reserved one slot for a transgender beneficiary. Vanchiyur P Babu, chairman, development standing committee, said that the corporation is yet to receive any application from transgender persons for the e-rickshaw scheme. He said that the slot will be left open for transgender beneficiary. Babu also added that the initial list was compiled from applications received from nine wards and more applications are being submitted from other wards.

The e-rickshaw with four seats will have two passengers on each side, sitting face-to-face. The minimum rate has been tentatively fixed at Rs 10. The e-rickshaws will be rolled out with a special colour theme in sync with the city’s heritage and history. The design of the theme is expected to be finalized within a week. E-rickshaws will be brought to the city from the showroom in Kollam. The shared auto scheme is expected to be implemented in wards under coming under ‘area-based development’ (ABD) to ensure connectivity between minimum distance points within central wards.

SCTL has mandated that e-auto and e-rickshaw shall be operated with Lithium battery and that charging cable should be fast-charging enabled. Besides, it should have real time GPS tracking system with emergency request buttons. The officials said that the vendors will be tasked with the responsibility of ensuring additional features in vehicles procured through ‘Government e Marketplace’ (GeM).

SCTL is planning to procure e-autos from Kerala Automobiles Ltd. The vehicles should also have the facility for generating printed bills for commuters for greater transparency and acceptance. The supplier will be responsible for registration of vehicles with the Kerala motor vehicles department. E-rickshaws are expected to ply at a speed below 35km/h while e-autos can move at a speed above 35 km/h.

The ownership of vehicles will rest with SCTL for the first one year and after that it will be transferred to respective beneficiaries. E-autos will ply within the limits of wards under ABD, but relaxations will be made for plying outside ABD areas as well.

Kozhikode: IUML leader and deputy leader of opposition in the assembly M K Muneer said there was no need for IUML to take action against party workers for attending the anti-CAA human chain organized by the LDF on Sunday.

Muneer said on Monday that though the IUML had decided not to participate in the programme, it had not issued any directions asking people not to participate in the programme in their individual capacity.

“Some people might have participated in it in their individual capacity. Those who are part of religious organizations have dual membership making them members of both IUML and the organisation concerned. For example, Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen (KNM) had decided to participate in the human chain and many IUML workers are part of the organization,” he said.

Muneer said that Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad will take part in the anti-CAA protest to be held at Kozhikode Beach at 3pm on Friday.

413,['28/01/2020'],Chackai flyover opened for one-way traffic,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Motorists were in for a Republic Day surprise when the Chackai flyover was opened for one-way traffic on Sunday morning. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) opened the stretch to facilitate movement of vehicles in the Kovalam-to-Kazhakoottam direction.

Vehicles can now enter the flyover immediately after Enchakkal Junction. A slip-road access has been provided at Chackai Junction for vehicles coming from the airport or city and heading to Kollam side to enter the flyover.

With construction progressing on the slip road at the opposite end, NHAI plans to have the flyover fully functional in 10 days. This slip road will enable vehicles from Chackai or the airport heading in the direction of Kovalam to access the flyover.

NHAI is operating the flyover’s streetlights using a generator as differences with KSEB over cost has delayed electrification. After quoting an exorbitant Rs 1.75 crore for lighting the stretch, the electricity board agreed to relook the number. It is expected to submit a revised estimate soon.

The over bridge allows motorists to bypass Chackai Junction and thus reduce travel time. However, some motorists are concerned over increased congestion at Enchakkal Junction. And this is expected to worsen when the flyover becomes fully functional. Vehicles taking the bridge come to a grinding halt at Enchakkal Junction, which has direct access to vehicles coming from East Fort and Beemapally. Moreover, KWA’s manhole renovation work at the intersection can only add to the woes.

With the Chackai flyover readied, the Kazhakoottam-Mukkola NH stretch is nearing completion. NHAI is currently engaged in the construction of the underpass to Akkulam bridge. The authority has envisaged a pedestrian underpass with access to light motor vehicles. “On the Kuzhivila side, the level of the underpass has been raised by 1 metre to solve the issue of water logging,” sources said.

NEW DELHI: Tihar Jail authorities on Sunday conducted another mock hanging of the four Nirbhaya case convicts as they are likely to be hanged on February 1. Sources said the hangman, Pawan Jallad , has been asked to report to Tihar on January 30.

The authorities have asked for a dozen new manila ropes from Buxar prison, which would be lubricated and left to dry for two days. Sources said a mock drill is a mandatory procedure before every hanging since the body weight of the convicts tends to change. The dummy hanging was conducted using four sacks filled with sand and gravel that had similar weights as the convicts to check the strength of the ropes that would be used for the actual execution. The sacks were left suspended for three hours after which an expert checked the condition of the ropes.

Jail sources said the wardens and doctors of Tihar have been asked to ensure that the body weight of the four convicts remains constant till they are hanged. The authorities have taken the measurements of the necks and heads of the four convicts. The hangman will prepare the noose according to the measurements.

On Monday, the family members of convict Akshay Kumar Singh were allowed to meet him. In the emotional meeting, he discussed about the legal recourse with his parents. He, Pawan and Vinay have the option of filing a mercy plea before the President.

The families of the other inmates will be allowed to meet them twice a week as per their schedule. During the meeting, the family members will be allowed to take the personal belongings of the convicts and record a will in the presence of a superintendent. The convicts have refused to give the last date of their meeting to the jail authorities despite several reminders. They have also refused to prepare a will. A red notice will be sent to the families about the execution so that they can make preparations to take back the bodies.

Artistes in a scene from the play staged at Chatterton Hall, All Saints’ Cathedral Ground, Sadar, on Sunday

Nagpur: Like every time, director Vikash Khurana of Stagecraft Theatre came up with a hilarious play ‘Karan Kumar Khanna Ke Khatarnak Karnamon Ka Kaatilana Kissa’ (K9) that was staged at Chatterton Hall, All Saint’s Cathedral Ground, Sadar, on Sunday.

The play depicts a story of a rich resident of South Delhi, Karan Kumar Khanna who has his wedding around the corner. When girlfriend’s mother (Jaee Jog) pesters him to get his fortune read, he relents — like any other son-in-law.

The fortune teller, Guruma (Sanskruti Bajoria) tells him that he has blood on his hands and that he will commit a murder in his lifetime. Being the ‘proper gentleman’ and wanting to save his future wife, Dimple (Dimple Anandani) from humiliation, Karan decides to get the dirty deed done with before his wedding.

He teams up with his manager Natwar Singh (Samson Aiyub) and a terrorist Al-Kabzz (Shubhankar Mishra) and what follows is a hilarious series of mishaps as they try to commit a murder.

Rahul Bhojwani shines as Karan as he goes to great lengths to murder someone. Aiyub’s performance as an incompetent ‘Sardaarji’ who is Karan’s manager shows brilliance.

Mishra who plays the constipated terrorist Al-Kabzz makes the audience laugh without fail every single time with his spectacular comic timing and dialogue delivery. Karan’s family comprising of ‘chachi’ Aarti Khanna (Anurima Chakraborty), ‘mama’ Vishnu Dewan (Ashwin Shukla), ‘bua’ Preeti Malhotra (Shweta Kewalramani) all make up the perfect ensemble of an entertaining Indian family.

Adapted by Nitish Chandra, the play is based on Oscar Wilde’s short story — Lord Arthur Saville’s Crime.

The play was produced by NV Sharma and Nirmalya Sinha.

Sound and lights were done by Onkar Ghare, Rajat Rajani and Nirmalya Sinha.

419,['28/01/2020'],More app-based cabs at Chennai airport likely from next month,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Chennai Airport

CHENNAI: Passengers landing at Chennai airport may have multiple cab operators to choose from starting next month. Now, only one app-based cab service is allowed to pick up passengers from arrival terminals .

Airports Authority of India is looking to bring in more cab services to offer pick-up from the airport as there have been many complaints from passengers who said that they were forced to book vehicles from only one app if they wanted to get picked up from arrival terminals. A majority of the passengers prefer to board cabs from the lane in front of the terminal and do not want to go the parking lot to board other cabs.

A meeting was held in New Delhi with representatives of cab operators to work out a way to have more operators run their service from the airport. For now, Ola is the only operator.

“We are trying to give contracts to multiple operators. The existing contract system allows for one prime operator and two secondary operators. But the two other operators who had counters inside the terminals have withdrawn,” said a senior AAI official.

He said the meeting was to “understand what changes will be needed in the contract procedure to ensure that there would be more than one cab service at the airport. The current procedure is not friendly to all.”

Since Ola was paying a high licence fee, its cabs are allowed to pick up passengers from the terminals. Other cabs are allowed only to pick up from parking lots or pick-up points farther from the terminals. This led to chaos and entry points were barricaded and men were posted to prevent cabs of other companies from entering the pick-up lane along the terminals.

An official said the system invited too much criticism because passengers were not getting cabs on time.

“The wait time at the arrival terminal gate for cabs extends to more than 20 minutes during peak hours at night. International passengers with three to four heavy bags suffer the most. This is because the cab aggregator does not have enough vehicles and passengers cannot book any other cab. The cab service that can be booked from inside the terminal is expensive,” he said.

420,['28/01/2020'],‘Don’t link PhD and NAAC accreditation’,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Former vice-chairman of University Grants Commissionm professor H Devaraj, spoke to TOI on why there is a rush to publish papers and getting PhDs, how the UGC intervened to discontinue the part-time PhD programme in Bharathiar University and the measures taken to end outsourcing of PhD.

Why is there a rush to get PhDs and to publish in journals?

We should not ask PhD or research papers for NAAC or NBA accreditation. It causes inbreeding PhDs and paid publications. Clearing NET/SLET is tougher than getting PhDs. But UGC adopted a wrong policy when it decided to give increments for faculty members who completed PhD. MHRD also announced that PhD would be a minimum qualification for assistant professors in universities from 2021.

Too many papers being published ...

We need to be careful while allowing colleges to do research work. Many colleges do not have the infrastructure or resources to do it. Yet they are publishing papers due to the prominence given in accreditation for research publications. Part-time PhD (category B) is another major reason for the dilution in quality of PhDs. Unless there is a collaborative research by industry experts and academia, we should not allow any part-time PhDs.

What can be done to ensure quality?

Candidates with JRF or project fellowship alone should be allowed to do PhD. PhDs are not required to teach in colleges. Candidates who clear National Eligibility Test will be competent to do research and write thesis. If we ensure these steps, then there will not be any need for outsourcing research work.

UGC once intervened to stop part-time PhD programme in Bharathiar University. How should UGC deal with outsourcing PhD and ghost writing?

Bharathiar University once admitted thousands of PhD scholars under part-time PhD (category B) programme. A student from anywhere can register for the PhD and a guide from anywhere can supervise and they can submit theses. It was horrible. In 2015, UGC had called then vice-chancellor to Delhi and ordered him to stop the programme. Later, university discontinued the programme. UGC should evolve new mechanisms to identify and prevent outsourcing PhDs and ghost writing. They should enhance the punishment for such practices.

CHENNAI: For more than a year now, the road to Alamparai Fort, the crown jewel of the fishing village of Kadapakkam, about 100km from Chennai, has been shut. Access to the hauntingly picturesque Mughal-era fort overlooking the Bay of Bengal , was cut off after incidents of gang war and murder of local fishermen.Now, the department of archaeology, Tamil Nadu, is inspiring fresh hope among villagers and a new lease of life into the disintegrating walls of the once bustling trade centre, as Alamparai gets restored as part of a multi-crore project covering 12 archaeological monuments across the state.""We spent two months just clearing thick vegetation that had cracked open the walls and covered the complex,"" says the assistant engineer at the site. ""We’re rebuilding the foundation of the wall facing the sea from scratch and also using boulders from the ruins to build a structure to keep the sea from reaching the walls,"" he says.Historians attribute the earliest construction of the fort, to Sambuvarayars – feudatories of the Cholas — who find a mention in Kalki’s ‘Ponniyin Selvan’. ""It was rebuilt several times after that, until it came to the Nawabs and the Mughals. It finally went to the French, who lost it to the British in the Carnatic wars,"" says historian R Venkatesh.Perhaps proof to this are the granite cannon balls that workers found inside the fort’s walls in the course of the restoration. The most recent damage incurred by the structure was following the 2004 tsunami that eroded its sea-facing walls and piled up large heaps of sand against it. The fort as it stands today, covers an area of 14.5 acres, with a 7m wall, a 9m bastion and 12 watch towers. Inside the complex are smaller run-down rooms that experts suggest could have been soldiers’ resting places or stables. It also has a tomb, which locals believe to be a sacred shrine and worship.According to the state department of archaeology website, excavations at the site have unearthed copper, iron, glass and lead objects, porcelain wares, spindle whorl, terracotta lamps, coins, and smoking pipes, revealing rich trade activity during 17th-18th century. ""This area was one of the Chola provinces and called Edaikazhinadu, a name it continues to have. It was also a centre for weaving, so a lot of muslin could have been exported,"" says Venkatesh. Reports also suggest that the fort was a hub of salt, silk and ghee trade for the Arcot Nawabs.Till a few years ago, the ruins of Alamparai were a favourite shooting spot for filmmakers, and to this day, fishermen reminisce about the tea breaks and catamaran rides they had with popular actors. Joyrides on the catamaran and a delicacy of fried fish dished up from the day’s catch, are a few of the unofficial attractions for tourists visiting the fort. While some fishermen feel its renovation and regularisation of tourism may disrupt these impromptu earnings, other villagers are looking forward to the business opportunities it could bring.""If word spreads about the fort, it will attract more people, and the women, who usually are at home when the men are fishing, can set up shops of their own to sell fish and refreshments. It will also help clear the image of our village that had so far been in the news for the violence. Alamparai could make us known for the right reasons,"" says Saranya, a fisherwoman.In Video: Restoration work to infuse new lease of life into TN's Alamparai Fort",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73691318,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-919741,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/holding-fort-against-the-sands-of-time/articleshow/73675803.cms

Though the administration has focused much on maintaining the Mall Road and roads frequented by tourists, several roads in the old part of the town are completely damaged,” said Alok Tiwari, a resident of Tallital area.

Another resident, Shubham, added, “If one travels to roads in upper areas of the town, they become very slippery during rains and snowfall. The sewage lines laid right in between and damaged after rains pose a greater danger in those conditions.”

The condition of roads in Haldwani isn't any better. In fact, in many of the areas, locals say that roads have not been repaired for years and they have to drive through these potholes each day because the administration hasn't taken any steps to repair them.

Rashid Khan, a resident of the Banbhoolpura area in Haldwani said that the roads in the area have not been relaid for over a decade now. ""The authorities built the road almost ten years back. Since then, they have been damaged beyond repair, still nothing has been done,"" he said.

He added that overflowing sewage in the city further adds to the misery of the locals.

When queried on the steps being taken to address the issue, Nainital district magistrate Savin Bansal said, “We have been building and repairing the major roads of the district, and this includes the secondary roads as well as the smaller streets as well. However if any street has been left out, they, too, will be repaired soon.”

The state Public Works Department (PWD) also chose to claim that “all is well.” State PWD chief Hariom Sharma said that “the department keeps taking stock of the damaged roads and that the road-repairing work has already started in several areas.” “We keep repairing the damaged roads before and after the monsoons. The repair work is going on in several areas and the damaged roads in Nainital district, too, will be repaired soon.”

Thiruvananthapuram: Veteran Congress leader A K Antony has called for a joint protest without divisions such as LDF and UDF against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Inaugurating the ‘Kaval Yatra’ organized by KPCC Samskara sahiti here on Monday night, Antony said those who now stay away from protest should realise that more damaging legislations are in the pipeline. “The CAA is a part of the RSS agenda to destroy our Constitution,” he said.

Antony said the biggest protest mobilization in the country after Quit India protest is happening now under the leadership of students and youth. “I have taken part in the protest amidst chilling cold in Delhi. When I come here, I am only happy to join the protest here,” he said after handing over the flag of the rally to captain Aryadan Shoukath.

The Kaval Yatra will tour the state with a message to save the Constitution and conclude at Kasaragod on February 13. On Tuesday, the yatra will pass through Kollam district.

Meanwhile, in Kozhikode, INTUC state president R Chandrasekharan said that Congress and UDF should have carried out a joint agitation along with LDF against the CAA. The joint stir against the controversial Act at the national level under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi had the participation of CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury and other opposition leaders, he said at a news conference on Monday. “INTUC thinks that Congress should work for taking all opposition parties together on the issue,” he added.

The Goa Young Innovator Award 2019-20 is open to all Goan schools, and students will compete under two categories — Classes V to VII and Classes VIII to X. The schools have to submit all entries by February 22 and the winners will be announced in March, Lobo said.

Students can submit their ideas to their schools and, after vetting, the school will submit the product or innovation to GSInC along with a description of the technology used, sketches of the project and details of the students, GSInC chairman Jose Manuel Noronha said.

Three winners will be picked from each category and they will receive mentorship and, if found viable, the state is ready to finance the patent process.

Aurangabad: City MP Imtiaz Jaleel has urged chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to set up a skills development university in Aurangabad.

According to a statement issued by the MP, he also discussed several other issues with the CM during a meeting in Mumbai on Monday.

Pressing for the need for vocational training and addressing the issue of unemployment, the MP asked the CM to establish a skills development university in Aurangabad. “There is enough Waqf land in possession of dargahs or religious trusts and the same should be used for establishing the university,” he said.

Terming drinking water as the biggest problem of his constituency, Jaleel urged the chief minister to personally look into the problem. “The state government should issue work order for the Rs 1,680 crore water project for Aurangabad,” the MP said.

Jaleel also demanded that urgent measures must be taken to create nearly 400 jobs at the Government Medical College and Hospital in the super-specialty block. He also brought the issue of delay in procuring medicines though Haffkin to the GMCH.

The MIM state president also sought land acquisition for expansion of Aurangabad airport runway which would pave way for bigger aircrafts. “Farmers and other land owners should be immediately compensated for their lands which have been kept on hold since 2016,” Jaleel said.

Thackeray held a meeting with MPs from across the state in Mumbai in wake of the upcoming budget session. NCP president Sharad Pawar, state cabinet ministers and secretariat staff were also present at the meeting.

Aurangabad: The office-bearers and officials of the civic body, who had gathered at the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation headquarters to celebrate Republic Day on Sunday, were greeted by the residents of Gadiya Vihar with jars of turbid water that was being supplied to their areas by the civic body.

Residents of Kasliwalpuram society in Gadiya Viharhave have been receiving contaminated water for the past six months. Initially, the AMC had taken up the work of repairing the damaged pipeline that supplied drinking water to the society. However, the work has not yet been completed and the 100 families living in the society continue to receive contaminated water. The water is murky and blackish in colour and contains impurities visible even to the naked eye.

On Sunday, around 20 residents of the society gathered near the headquarters to attract the attention of the office-bearers and the officials to the issue of contaminated water supply.

They brought along transparent jars containing the murky water.

Mayor Nandkumar Ghodele, the standing committee chairman, corporators and municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey, who were among the officials present there to hoist the flag had to face the angry residents. The residents showed the dirty water to the authorities and explained their concerns.

Subhash Kadam, a resident, said, “Consumption of this water can cause sickness among the people, especially children. We knew the officials will be there for the function so we took up the issue on Sunday,” Kadam said.

He said the ignorance of the civic officials is responsible for the delay in work.

Mayor Nandkumar Ghodele directed the civic officials to complete the repair work of the pipeline promptly. He assured the residents the work will be completed and their issue will be resolved within 2-3 days.

Thiruvananthapuram: Unmindful of the poor response of non-governmental institutions to the first edition of state higher education survey , the Kerala state higher education council ( KSHEC ) has launched the survey for 2019 -20.

Modelled on All India Survey on Higher Education and named as AKHES (All Kerala Higher Education Survey), the survey intends to collect data pertaining to higher education institutions in the state covering government, aided, autonomous, unaided colleges and universities. Only less than 400 among the 1,400 odd higher education institutions in the state participated in the 2018-19 survey.

AKHES 2019-20 survey is an attempt to set up and update an authentic and reliable database on higher education institutions in the state, lack of which, say experts, has taken a toll on policy formulation for qualitative improvement of the sector. Following the request of the council, the state government has now made participation in higher education survey mandatory for institutions for seeking State Assessment and Accreditation Council (SAAC) accreditation. The government plans to use SAAC accreditation as a yardstick when considering requests for new courses and batches in colleges. The last date for uploading data of the institutions is Feb 29, 2020.

“KSHEC is planning to release a statistical booklet (annually) based on the data consolidated from the higher education institutions that have participated in the survey. The booklet, besides including data on the above parameters, will also include the list of programmes offered by the institutions in the state,” council member secretary Rajan Varughese said.

Data is being collected on several parameters such as the institution’s basic information, details of faculty and non-teaching staff, programmes conducted under various faculties/schools & departments/centres, students’ enrolment, examination, financial information such as receipt and expenditure under various heads — funds, scholarships, loans, infrastructure.

Representative image

MADURAI: It has become rare to see an urban child without having access to smart phones these days. It is a blessing to have the whole world at your fingertips through internet, but along with it comes an addiction problem.

""Addiction to smart phones is similar to drugs or alcohol. It’s all the same chemicals in the brain. What starts off simply using the device to take care of one’s needs, ends up escalating to developing dependency on the device. The only difference is that there is no additional substance that goes inside the body, which makes it less intense,"" said Dr Kumanan T, a psychiatrist.

Many private schools in the city, where children from middle class and upper middle class families are studying, find an increasing number of students addicted to smart phones.

""Initially, it was the odd student who would misbehave and bring smart phone to the school without the parents’ knowledge. But now we have to conduct raids in classrooms and seize phones. Students have hiding places or use it in washrooms. Though many tell us that it is to contact their parents after school, they still do use it during school hours,"" said the principal of a private school.

Peer pressure is often one of the major reasons for children attempting to sneak smart phones.

""Just like putting your collar up, wearing special wrist bands or any other fashionable and cool thing done by school kids, there is a fascination about smart phones. By showing off their smartphones or taking selfies, they are garnering their peers’ attention and sometimes this leads to jealousy or even theft,"" said a counsellor and teacher at a private school in KK Nagar.

Children mostly use smart phones for social media and playing games such as PUBG. ""Children are becoming frustrated quickly these days and are having low tolerance to boredom. All they are thinking about is instant gratification. I want to post something or play game at this moment and it should be done immediately. I can’t wait. That is the thinking they are developing,"" observed Dr Kumanan.

Nashik: The civic administration is likely to allow the archaeology department to use the space near Sunder Narayan temple to keep its equipment.

Now that the site near Sunder Narayan temple will be taken over by Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation Ltd (NMSCDCL) for undertaking projects under the smart city mission, the archaeology department will have to look for an alternate space to keep its equipment.

“We discussed the issue with civic officials on Monday. They have allowed us to use their space to keep the materials,” said officials from the archaeology department.

The archaeology department has already started shifting its material and equipment from the garden to the roadside.

Assistant director of the department of archaeology, Virag Sontakke, said, “We repeatedly requested the smart city authorities to allow us to complete the first phase of restoration before we shifted the materials. We may face problems in the new space as it is not big enough to design the stones to be used for restoration.”

“NMSCDCL has been asking the archaeology department to vacate the space for nearly two months. We have started shifting the equipment to the roadside,” said Sontakke. The archaeology department will take a week’s time to shift their material from the garden, but that has not hampered their work.

According to Sontakke, the temple from the Peshwa era needs to be restored as it was and minute intricacies have to be carved upon the stones. The labourers need their time and space to work.

The archaeology department had set the deadline of completing the restoration works by March this year.

The play was staged on Sunday as well.

The play was presented by Cinematograph group and produced by Sachin Kamani and Hussain Zaidi. The technicians are Sameer Sheikh (sound operator) and Asmit Pathare (light designer).

Having received rave reviews in India and abroad, the play is Kapoor’s reimagination of the character Macbeth. It unfolds the original play’s bold themes of greed, power, lust and betrayal by transforming the characters into eccentric clowns and presenting a different take with improvised humour and Pop culture references.

Two clowns named Julio (Pathak) and Pedro (Malik) claim to be the producers of the play and unravel the story of Macky B (Shorey). Macky B and his friend Banquo set out on an adventure in the forest where they meet three witches who give them three impending prophecies. The two are then sent on a journey that leads to tragic consequences and the original theme of the play comes to the fore.

437,['28/01/2020'],Ravi Kannan: Padma Shri doctor from Chennai who is saving patients in Assam,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Dr Ravi Kannan (in white shirt) has subsidised medical costs and helped poor patients’ kin have an additional ... Read More

CHENNAI: Bomb blasts and floods were the two things that came to mind when senior surgical oncologist Dr Ravi Kannan got an offer to head a hospital in facility. A weekend at the hospital in 2007 changed his opinion about the state. The 13 years he spent taking cancer treatment to the doorstep of poor patients, improving follow-up care and subsidising medical costs, earned him the Padma Shri this year.

It started with a visit to the Cachar Cancer Hospital in Silchar on request. As he was going around the wards of the hospital, his wife Seetha mingled with the community. He quit his practice in Chennai and joined the hospital, while his wife, Seetha, quit her job for voluntary service.

""I thought if we offer low cost many people will come,"" he said. But he soon realised that the needs of patients in Silchar were far more than those of patients in south India.

Most of the people there lived in poverty. So, when he saw a child eating puffed rice soaked in water with chillies, he spoke to the management and opened a free kitchen. ""I thought with free food and shelter people will be happy to receive treatment. In many cases treatment was free too. So it was good. Or so I thought,"" he said.

In 2011, results of an in-house study crashed all hopes. ""We found only 58% of people who tested positive for cancer didn’t return for treatment. Only 28% completed treatment. People were dying in pain and agony. If they have to come for treatment, they need to be accompanied by a family member, who will have to lose their wages and the family will starve,"" he said.

That’s when the hospital decided to offer jobs to patients and their attenders. Initially, it was planning jobs like tailoring and candle making, but found that people also needed training.

""So, we offered them jobs that required unskilled labour. They could clean wards or water plants for Rs100 a day. Some would do plumbing and carpentry,"" he said.

Hospital social workers were given cellphones to remind people of follow up schedules. Some patients paid an annual fee of Rs500 for consultation with multiple specialists and some paid nothing. If they did not return, medical teams were sent for free homecare. Soon, compliance went up to 70%.

But there is one thing that hasn’t changed since 2007 — the weekly calls he has been having with his mentor Dr Shanta to discuss the disease, treatment and problems. ""Medical schools don’t teach you service, but teachers like her and Dr S Krishnamurthi do. Like her, I give away the cash I receive as awards so poor can benefit,"" he said.

438,['28/01/2020'],Keralites lead CAA protests in Finland,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: As thousands joined human chain protest against Citizenship (Amendment) Act in the state on Republic Day, its ripples reached as far as Finland. Indians and locals in three cities of Finland held a peaceful protest in solidarity with the protests across India. Interestingly, many youths from Kerala were active in organizing the Finland protest.

More than hundred people participated in protests held in Helsinki, Tampere and Turku where they read the Preamble of the Constitution and organized speeches explaining CAA and NRC and on the importance of safeguarding India’s Constitution.

“I see the passing of the CAA and current political atmosphere as an imminent threat to our constitutional values and secularism. If our country slips into a theocratic state (religious), India may never be a safe haven for millions of its religious minorities,” said Thiruvananthapuram-based Indu who is pursuing higher studies in international law and human rights in Finland.

Shameer from Thrissur who works as an IT consultant in Helsinki said, “I want India to support all refugees fleeing persecution irrespective of religion. Having seen the Holocaust memorials in Germany and Poland, I am afraid of genocidal consequences of statelessness to many Muslims in India.”

Holding placards with slogans against CAA and NRC written in English, Hindi, Tamil and Malayalam, the group staged dharna near popular places in their respective cities.

In Helsinki, the protesters conducted a silent march through the centre of the city accompanied by police vehicles.

The protesters also said instead of imposing CAA, the central government should focus on reviving the economy and developing the country.

Madurai: Though psychiatrists and counsellors insist that good physical activity outdoors can help children reduce their dependency on smart phones, parents question its practicality in the modern city landscape.

""There are only a few places outside, which are safe to play these days. Children are scolded for running around or playing on streets. Even for playing proper games such as cricket or football in a safe place, we have to go to sports facilities and pay membership fees, which are not affordable. Isn’t it cheaper to educate and entertain children with smart phones?"" asks Ramya R, a parent.

Senthilnathan M, president, Private Schools Correspondents Confederation, also echoed similar concerns and called for private schools to be more responsible in providing increased physical activity for students. ""There is no place or time for children to do some physical activity outside school. After school, they are forced into going for extra-curricular classes, and if both parents are working, there is no one to take care of the child’s needs. Our community and residential areas are also not having proper recreational spaces for children. So, private schools should try to include mandatory physical activity for the students every day,"" he said.

Several parents and children felt that using smart phones in kid safe modes is enough and enjoy the fun during leisure time. Psychiatrist Dr Kumanan T also encouraged the practice of self-control to reduce addiction to smart phones. ""Smart phone addiction is a less intense form of addiction. By restricting usage at an early age and practising proper self-control, children can make the best use of smart phones and stay safe,"" he added.

Representative image

LUCKNOW: Nightlife is set to get enhanced in UP with the excise department now allowing restaurants and bars to serve liquor up to 2am. Starred hotels can take that a step further and serve liquor up to 4am. In order to promote tourism in the state, UP government’s new excise policy has eased rules for serving liquor, but has restricted the change to only big cities.

“We are now giving bars the option of serving liquor till 2am and to hotels up to 4am, but on certain conditions. Firstly, the option is only open to bars located in metro cities like Lucknow, Agra, Moradabad, Kanpur etc, apart from Noida and Greater Noida.

For all bars located in these areas, time can be extended up to 2am. Three, four and five star hotels can open bars up to 4am,” said Sanjay Bhoosreddy, principal secretary, excise.

Serving liquor under a temporary bar licence can also be extended by one hour, from midnight to 1am, but with special permission of the district magistrate and additional fees. The licence will be available for a six hour bracket, starting from 8am.

Service time in bars was 12am earlier and could be extended till 1am on payment of additional fees.

The new excise policy says that bars will have to pay an additional Rs2.5 lakh in licence fees for each two hour extension.

The excise policy has also allowed for an increase in areas in which liquor can be served in hotels. From the existing limit of five spots, areas for serving liquor can be added on the payment of Rs50,000 for each additional point.

Stressing on the need to making liquor available in special trains, cruises and airports as a means of encouraging tourism, with a special focus on foreign tourists, the excise department will also be giving licences for serving liquor at such locations. While a train licence will cost Rs10 lakh annually, it will be Rs3 lakh for a cruise and Rs5 lakh for airport bars.

However, while the rules come as a bonus for consumers, the Liquor Traders’ Association of UP is not very happy with the government’s refusal to allow them to open retail shops from 9am to 11pm, against the current time of 10am to 10pm.

“The rules are not friendly for retail shops. There has been an increase in licence fees but no increase in maximum retail price of liquor. Timings have also not been extended for retail shops even as hotels are being allowed to serve for longer,” said KL Maurya, secretary of the association.

443,['28/01/2020'],Trichy model to keep slums open defecation-free a hit,"This story is from January 28, 2020

TRICHY: The sanitation model introduced in the slums in the city in 1999 by roping in self-help group (SHG) women to maintain community toilets continues to be an effective mechanism even in 2020 in prevent open defecation. The successfully-demonstrated model, emulated by various local bodies, has been acknowledged as one of the achievements of Trichy City Corporation in its 25 years of existence. The model, which established 398 community toilets, has helped Trichy become the state’s first open defecation free (ODF) city in 2016.

In August 1999, Trichy City Corporation along with three NGOs namely Gramalaya , Scope Trichy and Sevai identified 186 slums in the city that are prone to open defecation. To tackle the situation, a plan was chalked out by the local body to make the slums ODF. The state government agreed to construct and revamp toilets in 75% of the city’s slums, whereas the NGOs were allotted the remaining 25% of the slums to build community toilets. Supported by international charity organisation Water Aid, community toilets were constructed by the NGOs across 25 slums at an outlay of Rs 4 crore. The corporation facilitated land and water and drainage connections for the community toilets in all the slums. ""Slum-dwellers were consulted right from the designing of community toilets. By inducing the ownership attitude, SHG women were told to maintain the toilets and educate neighbours not to defecate in the open,"" S Damodaran, founder, Gramalaya, said.

Instead of handing over the maintenance of community toilets to the corporation, ‘She’ (Sanitation and Hygiene Education ) teams comprising SHG women from the slums were formed to maintain the toilets in 1999. A minimum of 50 paise was collected as user fee. The She teams were given bank accounts to maintain records. Kalmandhai slum near Gandhi Market became India’s first 100% sanitised slum in 2000, earning state government’s appreciation. The same model was gradually emulated in all 186 slums by the end of 2005. ""Periodical and proper maintenance of community toilets by SHG women helped us maintain the open defecation-free status. The sanitation model made our slums unique,"" a corporation official said.

SHGs maintaining the community toilets were classified under a rigid mechanism of She teams (ward level). The She teams were brought under a pan-city level Wave federation (Women’s Action for Village Empowerment ) for an effective audit. Cross-subsidisation model was introduced to maintain the community toilets. The revenue from operating toilets close to commercial streets were utilised to maintain free or low-cost toilets in areas vulnerable to open defecation.

444,['28/01/2020'],‘CAA not against Muslims in India’,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Nagpur: Minorities from the Islamic countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan have migrated to India due to persecution. Since they do not have citizenship of India, they are unable to avail several facilities. Thus, Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) has been introduced to grant them citizenship but false rumours are being spread that the Muslim community are under the threat of being driven out of the country, said Captain (retd) Smita Gaikwad of Indian Army, on Saturday.

She was delivering the keynote address on ‘Understanding CAA and working of Maoist front organizations’. The lecture was organized by Yuva Aayam at Kalpataru Sabhagruh, Gorewada Road.

Unravelling facts about CAA, Gaikwad said, “Every country has different rules for citizenship. India came up with a set of such rules in 1955 with the Citizenship Act that grants citizenship by birth, descent, registration and naturalization. Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan can be granted citizenship if they have stayed for more than 11 years in India, by naturalization. Even today, that clause remains the same.”

She added, “There have been countrywide protests opposing CAA. Not only Maoists but people from the Muslim community, several NGOs and certain celebrities among others have joined the protests. This is a result of the lies and rumours that are being spread against the Act. Many of the people participating in protests have not even understood the concept of CAA. Maoist organizations take advantage of such situations and try to incite violence.”

Addressing the backlash against CAA, she said, “People have labelled the Act as unconstitutional. In India, there are some laws that are applicable to women and not men. This is because they were framed for protection of women after considering the social experience. Laws against caste atrocities were formed to counter discrimination. A law cannot be tagged unconstitutional for protecting minorities.”

“Even if the Act is unconstitutional, the democratic way to handle it is to approach the Supreme Court. There are a number of petitions filed and people are still taking to the streets and giving way to violence,” said Gaikwad.

She spoke at length about the objectives of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) functioning in urban areas, like mass mobilization, party building, building the United Front and military tasks.

Nagpur: Violating its own norms, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has expedited construction of walking track on Kukde Layout playground by uprooting trees. The garden department said the Tree Authority had not given permission to remove these trees.

A resident of Kukde Layout, Naresh Pandey, also alleged the ongoing works are unauthorized and also against the norms for playgrounds.

TOI had, on January 23, highlighted that the district court imposed a stay on NMC’s plan to develop garden on one of the playgrounds (No. 392) situated at Kukde Layout, because playground cannot be converted into garden. Also, it was highlighted that NMC started execution of the works on another playground (No. 225) in the same layout, where too residents opposed it.

Pande told TOI, “Staffers of NMC Dhantoli Zone on January 24 reached the playground (No. 225) and uprooted eight trees. Shami tree was one of those uprooted and very rare in the city. Among other trees, teak, like shami, cannot be uprooted without forest department permission. All trees were four-eight years old.”

He added that NMC is constructing a walking track in an unauthorized manner. It was sanctioned along with garden and green gym for playground (No. 392). After stay from district court, NMC shifted the works to this playground without revising the proposal.

A green gym has already been installed on the playground. NMC norms say only 15% construction, with 10% on ground floor and remaining 5% on first floor is allowed, that too only for sports purposes.

“NMC constructed compound wall and there was no need for walking track and green gym. All playgrounds, gardens and schools situated within 200 meter radius have green gym and walking track. I have lodged a series of complaints but NMC is not paying heed,” he said.

NMC Dhantoli Zone assistant commissioner Kiran Bagde said trees were uprooted with consent of NMC garden department. “Trees were uprooted and planted in another part of the same playground for construction of walking track,” she said.

As per norms, trees cannot be uprooted without Tree Authority’s permission. Even transplantation of trees requires Tree Authority’s approval.

NMC garden department denied it had given any permission from Tree Authority for uprooting and transplanting trees at the playground.

On the other hand, Bagde accused Pandey of creating problems by storing cow dung in the playground. “Pandey did not remove cow dung despite repeated reminders. Our staff cleaned the playground,” she said.

NMC garden department officials said works of garden and storm water drain have been dropped. They did not comment on works of green gym and walking track carried out in the playground without proper process and against norms.

Each and every playground excluding no. 392 has one or other construction, like library building and religious structures, in Kukde Layout, which is one of the biggest localities in South Nagpur.

448,['28/01/2020'],NIT to fill 25k tonne fly ash in sewage-logged basement,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Nagpur: Around 722 families have been residing in fear for the last 15 years due to Nagpur Improvement Trust’s (NIT) mistakes, at its housing scheme at Nandanvan in East Nagpur. The lower basement parking of the schemes has been filled with sewage water of Nag river for over a decade. Now, as a mitigation measure, NIT plans to fill the basement with 25,000 metric tonne fly ash.

The frightening situation came to fore from the tender issued by NIT on January 24 to fill the basements of seven towers with 25,000 metric tonne fly ash. NIT has sought fly ash from Koradi, Khaparkheda or Mauda thermal power stations. The contractor has to supply fly ash only with bulkers and unload it in basements through compressor pump.

Brick kilns used to operate in Nandanvan along Nag river. NIT constructed 13 towers of one BHK and two BHK flats on the area in 2002. NIT’s contractor constructed lower basement parking, upper basement parking and three floors of flats in each building. There was some problem in lower basement parking, so it was abandoned since auction of flats. Flat owners did not have any idea about the lower basement parking when they started residing in the flats between 2002 and 2005.

A former resident of the buildings, Subhash Ghate, told TOI his family is one of those who sold out and left the housing scheme due to the threat to the buildings. “In one of the rainy seasons, water from Nag river submerged the upper basement parking. During inspection, it came to fore there is a lower basement parking filled with sewage water. Then, people realized this was the reason for the permanent problem of foul smell and mosquitoes. Before that, people used to blame the foul smell and mosquitoes on Nag river,” he said.

Ghate added many engineers believe the buildings can collapse anytime as the basement has been filled with sewage for so long. “So, many people like me sold the flat and left,” he said.

BJP city vice-president Suraj Singh Thakur, who is following up on the problem at NIT and state government level, sent a copy of NIT’s report to TOI. In the note written after inspection, NIT admitted water logging in basement of buildings. “NIT appointed M/s PT Mase and Associates to conduct structural audit of all buildings and suggest works to repair and strengthen all structures in 2017. Chances of damage to foundation of buildings cannot be ruled out due to water logging in basement,” the report said.

In January 2018, Thakur and residents met the then CM Devendra Fadnavis and requested directions to NIT to repair and strengthen the buildings. Accordingly, the state’s urban development department (UDD) directed NIT to take up works immediately.

In October 2018, NIT planned various works, including filling all basements with cement concrete at a cost of around Rs3 crore. Thakur said NIT did not give administrative approval to the works citing lack of funds.

“We requested the government to provide the funds but nothing happened. During winter session, we met CM Uddhav Thackeray and explained to him the problems of 722 families. Also, Union minister Nitin Gadkari wrote a letter to the CM. UDD again directed NIT to begin mitigation measures with immediate effect,” he said.

Accordingly, NIT has now floated a tender for filling the basements with fly ash. Ghate said filling fly ash will not solve the problem. “Problem is likely to aggravate, NIT is not taking the issue seriously,” he said.

Thakur said the plan to fill fly ash is likely to work. “NIT can’t do much as it does not have funds. Government should approve funds for a solution,” he said.

NIT officials said plan for filling basements with fly ash was prepared only after detailed study. “It will resolve the problem,” the official said.

IN A NUT SHELL

* NIT constructed 13 towers of 722 flats with lower basement parking, upper basement parking and three floors

* Lower basement parking flooded with sewage water from Nag river

* People started living in flats between 2002 and 2005, but lower basement parking was totally hidden

* During rains, Nag river water submerged upper basement parking

449,['28/01/2020'],CAA is extremely misunderstood: Journalist,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Uday Nirgudkar at the event

Nagpur: “The Muslim community in India needs to be told that the CAA is not against them,” said Dr Uday Nirgudkar, journalist on Saturday at Dr Hedgewar Blood Bank’s Hall, Dharampeth. He was speaking on the topic ‘CAA and NRC’. Former MP Hansraj Ahir presided over the function.

He said, “It is our responsibility to tell at least one person from the community that CAA is not against them and that it is extremely misunderstood. There is a big potential in bringing harmony in religions. It cannot be left in the hands of religious fanatics and clerics.”

Nirgudkar informed the audience about the history which led to the enactment of CAA. “Over a period of time, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan were declared Islamic states. In case of Afghanistan, their law clearly states that all religious practices should be as per Sunni laws. So much so, the Shiya sect of Muslims are not welcome there.”

He further spoke about the religious persecution faced by many non-Muslim communities in these countries. “Jinnah had promised equal rights for Hindus in Pakistan. In the end, nothing was done about it. If a Muslim accused a non-Muslim of insulting the Quran (normally the burden of giving proof lies on the accuser), but in those places the non-Muslim has to prove his innocence. It’s totally bizarre.”

He also told the audience about a law, according to which if a Muslim kills a non-Muslim and that non-Muslim has died during conversion, he cannot be held liable for any crime. Nirgudkar gave many such examples of religious persecution.

“There has been a significant drop in the percentage of Hindu population in Pakistan and Bangladesh. So, they are either killed, converted or have migrated to India and are living without respect, identity or even any documents. This has been happening since 1971,” he said.

“Pakistani Constitution discriminates by law, the Indian constitution does not discriminate and even provides remedies in cases of discrimination. It is 100% false idea that Indian-born Muslims will be thrown out of the country.”

Women protesters stage a sit-in

MUMBAI: From the intervening night of January 26 and 27, hundreds of women occupied a section of Morland Road-Thandi Sadak near Nagpada in a protest like Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh against the Citizenship Amendment Act, National Register of Citizens and National Population Register.

The protesters are mainly from Nagpada, Jhoola Maidan, Madanpura and Agripada. Despite police’s attempt to persuade them to not stage a sit-in as they didn’t have a permission, they refused to budge.

Seated on the under-concretisation road, the mostly burqa-clad, slogan-chanting women said they would not move till CAA is repealed. “Almost all protesters are locals. We have come on our own and not at the behest of anyone. Thousands of Shaheen Baghs will come up in the country till the divisive and unconstitutional CAA is repealed,” said Sadia Shaikh, a protester.

Police tried to stop them, saying the protesters had not taken written permission; two police vans were stationed. “They didn’t seek permission for the dharna. Some outsiders too were seen here and our priority is to maintain law and order,” said DCP Abhinash Kumar.

MLAs Rais Shaikh, Amin Patel and NCP leader Naseem Siddiqui visited. The leaders said the protest would be peaceful and should not be stopped.

Some were seen holding cutouts of India’s map while one placard read: “Main Bharat ki beti hoon (I am a daughter of India).”

Trust that had the park in its possession has called BMC action illegal. Wall around plot was bulldozed on Mon... Read More

MUMBAI: Twenty-one years after the BMC ’s licence agreement with a private trust to develop a 1.6-acre recreation ground in the prime Cuffe Parade ended, the civic body finally took possession of the plot on Monday morning. Civic officials, accompanied by local residents and municipal councillors, bulldozed the wall around the plot. Residents have called it a major victory and are hopeful the civic body will develop and maintain it.

Officials said the trust had kept the space in its possession though after its agreement ended back in 1999. The trust’s managing trustee, though, said the matter was sub judice in the Bombay high court and the BMC had arbitrarily taken possession of the plot by not following due process of the law.

Maria Chico, a local, said she used to take her son to the park almost almost three decades ago and back then it was maintained well. “On Monday, when I accompanied BMC officials who were to take possession of the plot, I was shocked to find only wild grass everywhere. I am happy the garden will be revived to its former glory. I have fond memories of a beautiful pond within the space too.”

Harshita Narwekar, local corporator who was present on Monday, said a notice was served to Suraksha Trust on January 24. According to the notice, a copy of which is with TOI, a licence agreement between the trust and the BMC dated September 30, 1994, expired five years later in 1999. Terms of the agreement stated that Suraksha Trust must develop the ground within six months from the date the BMC handed it over. The BMC notice has alleged the trust failed to do so, depriving residents of a recreation facility. “Even though the licence period has expired, the trustees are holding out the said ground illegally and unauthorised,” stated the notice.

Chanda Jadhav, assistant municipal commissioner, A Ward, said the trust was informed on January 27 at 10.30am that the BMC would take possession of the ground. Corporator Makrand Narwekar said the trust repeatedly got a court stay to avoid handing it over.

When contacted, Jaikumar Jain, chairman and managing trustee, Suraksha Trust, said, “The BMC was restrained from taking action even by the city civil court without following the due process of law. They then approached the high court where the matter is sub judice. Despite that, they have taken possession of the garden today. They have clearly taken law into their hands. The BMC did not provide water and electricity. How was it possible to maintain the space in such a situation? I had repeatedly requested them to inform me how they wanted me to maintain the space as well. I will approach the court now.”

452,['28/01/2020'],More trees on the block: Greens plan protests,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Nagpur: Disapproving the civic administration’s decision of chopping down 139 trees for Smart City Project roads, environment activists in the city are filing objection letters demanding protection of the existing green cover.

TOI reported on Sunday that Smart City Project special purpose vehicle Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) has sought permission to cut 139 fully grown trees in different areas of East Nagpur. This, when a recent study done by the Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) Regional Remote Sensing Centre (RRSC) had highlighted significant absence of green cover in that part of the city.

NMC sources told TOI that most of the trees proposed to be cut are fully grown. “Some are on the road while others are inside residential properties. The trees belong to different species including subabul, mango, neem, raintree, Ashoka etc,” they said.

Calling the decision an “unsmart move for a smart city”, greens have decided to file maximum objection letters with the garden department of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). “We can’t make a city smart at the cost of environment. It is evident that protection of trees continues to be overlooked during the planning stage of any developmental project. The authorities should modify plans instead of compromising on green cover,” said Kaustav Chatterjee, founder of environment NGO Green Vigil Foundation.

The members will be filing an objection letter on Tuesday. Honorary wildlife warden of Nagpur Jaydeep Das has appealed to citizens to come forward and give their objections. “If we think that the smartness quotient of the city will increase by cutting existing trees and planting new ones, the project itself becomes questionable. In spite of the city feeling the impact of climate change and public movements like Save Bharat Van, authorities are turning a blind eye to the environment conservation,” said Das.

In the case of Bharat Van and Empress Van too, thousands of objection letters were filed by citizens. However, violating the Maharashtra (Urban Trees) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act, NMC did not conduct the mandatory public hearing.

While the proposal of felling trees at Bharat Van has been dropped, activists have demanded that a joint public hearing should be held for Empress Van and Smart City cases.

“What is the point of publishing public notices in a newspaper as it often goes unnoticed? NMC should involve all stakeholders and then decide the need for cutting trees,” added Chatterjee.

453,['28/01/2020'],"Civic chief absent, NMC GB meet on NIT issue adjourned","This story is from January 28, 2020

Nagpur: The urgent special general body meet of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation had to be postponed due to the absence of the municipal commissioner. The meeting on Monday was called by mayor Sandip Joshi to discuss the issue of guardian minister Nitin Raut wanting to reinstate the powers of the Nagpur Improvement Trust. It will now be held on February 4.

While the NMC is BJP dominated, Raut is from the Congress. The Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government had earlier taken a decision to dissolve the NIT but could not complete the process during its term.

The BJP was hoping to pass a resolution to maintain NMC as the sole planning authority. Now, the Congress-led opposition group has claimed it is due to the Fadnavis government that three civic agencies function in the city.

While ruling party leader Sandip Jadhav asked Joshi to postpone the meeting, leader of opposition group Tanaji Wanve said discussions can be held and a decision be taken by additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi. Outgoing municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar was in Mumbai to attend a meeting organized by speaker Nana Patole. Bangar’s replacement Tukaram Mundhe is likely to reach city on Tuesday.

Wanve told TOI that BJP is misguiding people on NIT. “It has not been dissolved. The NIT continues to execute works,” he said.

Wanve added that the Nagpur Metropolitan Region Development Authority (NMRDA) is the third civic agency in the city. “It came into existence over a year ago. The NIT had transferred many projects to NMRDA. Also, NMRDA got some projects from the state government,” he questioned.

Fadnavis government had approved a decision to amend the NIT Act as per which the NMC was supposed to get all assets and liabilities of NIT. Through the amendment, the past government had started the process to make provisions to distribute NIT’s assets and liabilities between NMC and NMRDA. With this it becomes evident that the two agencies will continue exist even after NIT is dissolved.

Khwaja Rabbani speaks at the event

Nagpur: People should follow only the Constitution which states that people are free to practice any religion regardless the state or other factors, said chancellor of Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences, Karad, Dr Vedprakash Mishra, during a programme title ‘Rashtra va Dharma — Vicharmanthan’, organized by Yashwantrao Chavan Pratishthan, at Dhanwate Hall, on Saturday.

The other speakers of the programme were Jain Darshanacharya Vipin Jain Shashtri, social worker Jagjit Singh and former director of archaeology department Khwaja Rabbani.

Highlighting the recent developments, Mishra said, “India as a country does not to promote any particular religion and is a sovereign nation.”

In his address Rabbani highlighted the teachings of Islam and mentioned that it promotes the ideology of being true towards the land where we live. “Muslims will always spread love irrespective of any particular region. Speaking on behalf of Muslims of India, I can assure that we will be true to the nation and its culture,” he said.

Singh said, “No religion has ever promoted the idea of hurting other humans or indulging oneself in ill practices.” He added, “Scientifically we are all the same. Religion is just a concept that humans have made and have been manipulating it according ot their wish.”

Raising an important question, Shastri said, “We need to ask ourselves — is religion contributing to the betterment of India or is it acting as an obstacle?”

“All the religions are same as their teachings are same. It is humans who have given it different titles of Hindu, Muslim, Jain, Sikh, and others.”

MUMBAI: That several Mumbaikars are aware about veganism was evident at Ahimsa Fest 2020 organised in Andheri (East) on Republic Day .

Hundreds thronged the festival to check out over 200 stalls showcasing vegan products, from food to footwear.

“As dairy products involve animal cruelty, we ask people to opt for milk-free butter made from peanuts and almonds. Vegans also avoid leather footwear and wallets; eco-friendly fibre and cork material are available,” said activist Darshana Muzumdar of Ahimsa Land NGO. Activist Shweta Savla of United for Compassion NGO said, “Our volunteers regularly hold awareness drives and vegan potluck events.” “Most believe it is difficult to go vegan. This is what Ahimsa Fest strives to disprove,” said activist Anand Siva. Vegan athletes like Kuntal Joisher who had climbed Everest were present. “The fest shows it is possible to live a life of compassion,” said Atul Doshi of the core committee. “Conserving water is key too,” said the committee’s Saroj Choudhary.

HYDERABAD: While the fear of a possible outbreak of the highly contagious Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is escalating with reports of suspected cases in parts of the country, the state is not prepared to carry out tests for the virus at existing facilities.Over one-and-a-half years ago, the outbreak of the Nipah virus and the subsequent epidemic scare had prompted authorities to plan the upgrade of the laboratory at the Institute of Preventive Medicine ( IPM ) to biosafety level 3(BSL 3) from the existing BSL level 2.Nearly 18 months later, the plan is still stuck in red tape.The existing facilities continue to be of a level which does not permit testing for highly contagious and emerging viruses such as Nipah virus, Ebola virus, Zika and Corona.Currently, only National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune is equipped to test for Coronavirus and other such highly contagious viruses. The need for high level of biosafety is pertinent to prevent the onset of a bio hazard. A bio hazard in this regard is an outbreak of the disease that can be caused if bio waste released during testing is not disposed properly.The BSL 3, meanwhile, entails having a negative pressure room that is temperature controlled with fabricated roofs, sophisticated laboratory apparatus. The air that escapes the room will be highly filtered along with regular cleaning of all lab materials. BSL 3 provides highly restricted entry with requirement of cleaning the area every time a person enters the lab.The plan for upgrading the lab was approved at a meeting in June 2018 and Rs 3- Rs 3.5 crore was estimated to be cost for upgrading the lab. When asked about the facility, Dr K Shankar, director of Institute of Preventive Medicine (IPM), “The upgradation work is under process, currently. The decision has been taken but some civil works are pending,” adding that although testing equipment currently available at the lab can test for Coronavirus and other viruses, a minimum level of BSL 3 is required to conduct tests for Coronavirus and Nipah virus.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73682563,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-185339,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/coronavirus-looms-but-no-labs-in-t-to-test-samples/articleshow/73675912.cms

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Rahul Gandhi , MP of Wayanad, will carry out a long march to protest against the implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in his constituency on Thursday. As per KPCC decision, all party MPs are carrying out long marches in their constituencies against the CAA.

“In the meeting with Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi, we decided to convene a long march in Wayanad,” said KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran. Though we were a little hesitant in Gandhi leading such a march, he himself came forward for organizing such a march, he added.

“Rahul Gandhi was of the opinion that since KPCC had decided to organize marches against CAA in all constituencies under the leadership of the respective MPs, he would also do the same in Wayanad,” said the KPCC president.

Ramachandran said the party has launched its campaign against CAA in all districts and the district presidents are now holding padyatras. “Only Congress is sincere in its campaign against CAA. Whatever the CPM has been doing is a gimmick or a political stunt,” he said.

While flaying the chief minister for remaining silent against the governor, the KPCC president said, “The chief minister is a prisoner of uncertainty. He is clueless as to what stand he should take on the criticisms by the governor against his government.”

The chief minister has the responsibility to clarify his stand on the criticisms made by the governor against his government, he said. “He should open his mouth and comment. It is nothing but a hide and seek game played by our chief minister. On the one hand, he wants to appease the Centre and on the other side he wants to exploit the vote bank too,” said Ramachandran.

458,['28/01/2020'],State BJP brass throngs Pankaja’s hunger strike venue in show of unity,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Aurangabad: Senior BJP functionaries, including former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, made their way to the Aurangabad divisional commissionerate to extend their support to the token hunger strike launched on Monday by former rural development minister Pankaja Munde. The move was seen as a way to send out a message that everything was alright within the party.

Recently, after the core committee meeting, the party had declared that the BJP would agitate for Marathwada’s water demands under the leadership of Pankaja Munde, who incidentally has been critical of the party’s leadership since she lost the assembly election.

Despite the BJP trying to portray it as a party agitation, the banner put up on the podium claimed that the agitation is being organised under the aegis of ‘Gopinath Munde Pratishthan’, an NGO named after the late BJP stalwart and father of Pankaja and MP Pritam Munde.

Interestingly, the pandal was set up barely 10m from the place being dubbed as Aurangabad’s Shaheen Bagh, where around-the-clock anti-CAA/NRC/NPR agitation is underway for the past 20 days. The agitation and speeches continued peacefully at both the pandals, without making comments on each other.

For the water agitation, all BJP MLAs from across Marathwada — except a couple who cited personal reasons — reached the venue and shared the stage with the Munde sisters. Former assembly speaker Haribhau Bagde, Union state minister Raosaheb Danve, leader of opposition in legislative council Pravin Darekar, MLAs Atul Save, Narayan Kuche, Abhimanyu Pawar, Pasha Patel, Suresh Dhas, Prashant Bamb were amongst those present. Most attendees, however, were Pankaja supporters who shouted slogans hailing Pankaja during party functionaries’ speeches.

Fadnavis, who has been appointed as the leader of the opposition, appreciated Pankaja’s move of organising the hunger strike. Fadnavis also warned that if the state government stops the water-related schemes started by the previous government, the BJP will take to the streets.

While recalling his efforts to address Marathwada’s water woes, he appealed the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in the state to let Jayukt Shivar (the former CM’s pet project) continue even if its name is changed. He maintained that Rs 4,000 crores were given for diverting river water from the Konkan towards Godavari and said that the government should ensure completion of the work, which is in the last phase.

The token hunger strike concluded with Pankaja’s speech, demanding addressing of the water issues of the region, apart from holding cabinet meeting in Aurangabad. Going soft on the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, she maintained that she does not have anything against the government and she is hopeful that it will do well. She made an emotional appeal to her followers by asking them to ignore those making statements against her and said that she is staging the protest for people, and not for any post. She said that if need be, she will not hesitate to opt for an indefinite hunger strike.

459,['28/01/2020'],Govt auctions manganese mine in Ramtek tiger den,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Nagpur: The Nagpur forest division is in a quandary as the state mining department has auctioned manganese mines in tiger-bearing areas in Gugaldoh block under Ramtek range.

The Central government amended the Mines & Mineral (Development & Regulation) Amendment Act, 2015, which has been implemented from January 12, 2015. The amendment relaxed norms and allowed mining even in notified areas and asked states to auction such mines through competitive bidding process.

Accordingly, the contract for prospective mining lease in compartment number 293 of Gugaldoh (Manegaon beat) has been bagged by Raipur-based firm Shanti GD Ispat & Power Private Limited, which was the highest bidder.

SK Pande, president and CEO of Sharda Ispat, confirmed the firm has bagged contract for mining. “We are in the process of obtaining forest, environment, and wildlife permissions,” he added.

Nagpur forest officials said, of the 105 hectare area auctioned for mining, 99.95 hectare falls in reserve forest while 5.05 hectare is with revenue department. The area was auctioned in 2018.

They said the area has old history of manganese mining in 1950-55. Now, the abandoned mines have developed into rich forest and wildlife habitats as the mining pits have turned into good water bodies.

The proposed mine area is a reserve forest and hence project proponent needs forest, environment as well as wildlife clearance. As the area is sensitive, Nagpur deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) Prabhunath Shukla had asked forest officials to submit a survey report.

Ramtek forest officials conducted a survey and had also installed camera traps for one month between December 7, 2019, and January 6, 2020. The camera trap survey recorded images of scheduled animals like tigers, leopards and rattle, porcupines, wild dogs, jungle cats, nilgai, deer, sambar, wild boars, peacocks and hares.

On December 7, a full-grown tiger was found dead in one of the abandoned mine pits in the same area. “We have submitted a negative report and the forest area should not be handed over for mining at any cost,” said forest officials involved in the survey.

Nagpur district honorary wildlife warden Kundan Hate says, “As tiger numbers in Pench tiger reserve are increasing, the proposed mine area is being used by tigers and wildlife to settle down. If the area is allotted for mining, conflict will be inevitable. We will oppose the move.”

Sukhada Chaudhary at the Indian Youth Conclave 4.0, held on Saturday

Nagpur: Interactive sessions and workshops raised the curtain for the youth fest Indian Youth Conclave (IYC) 4.0, organized by IIM Bangalore-incubated start-up at Chitnavis Centre, Civil Lines, on Saturday. The two-day event celebrated being young and passionate as personalities from various walks of life interacted with the youth and spoke about their life journeys with a view to inspire them to follow their passion.

On the first day, IYC featured nearly 20 events including sessions on start-up, blogging, filmmaking, culinary arts, leadership, marketing and music among others.

Co-founder of Chaos Theory, a co-working space, Sukhada Chaudhary spoke at length on the theme ‘Do what you love’. In order to help the youth navigate their options, she said, “If there is an idea that refuses to leave your mind for 10 days or more, it is the first sign that you should put in efforts and acquire it.”

She added, “It is completely fine to not have an idea. Talk to people, explore several options and wait for it to come to you and convince you to work for it.”

Speaking about the challenges, Chaudhary said, “You need to know that you are opting out of the rat race. Don’t compare yourself to your contemporaries as it is essential to have a personal definition of success.”

Rishab Joshi, a dentist turned into an award winning filmmaker, shed light on his contrasting professions and motivated the youth to follow their passion wholeheartedly. He advised, “Instead of aiming for perfection, keep working on your passion without even worrying about the outcome. Everyone has their own journey but they need to start somewhere. Try to make mistakes because that is how you will learn to be better next time.”

Co-founder of The Climber, Ruhan Naqash, held a workshop on digital marketing where he addressed the two sides of the area — good and bad. He emphasized on how social media uses information entered by people to pedal fake news and targeted advertisements.

DIY artist Vibha Harish gave a talk on ‘How to give your passion a start’. Parth Bajaj unfolded his journey from being an engineer to a famous food blogger. ‘How to be sellable’ was tackled by brand chief of Thinking Birds, BK Mehta.

Representative image

HYDERABAD: Regional Transport Authority (RTA) has permanently suspended the driving licence of a businessman who reportedly drove his BMW car in an inebriated condition and hit a motorist resulting in his death in Madhapur on November 24. Incidentally, it was the second suspension in less than a week.

Recently, RTA had cracked the whip against actor Rajasekhar and software professional P Abhilash, whose negligent driving reportedly caused the death of two motorists on Biodiversity flyover in November last year, and suspended their driving licence.

Cyberabad police, in a press release, said K Ashwin Rao on November 24, after consuming alcohol at a star hotel in Madhapur, hit two motorists travelling on a bike while driving on wrong side.

The bike rider died on the spot, while the pillion rider suffered major injuries. Since police found that Ashwin had committed the offence, driving under the influence of alcohol, for the third time, they moved a proposal with the RTA concerned recommending suspension or revoking his licence.

“In December, a proposal was sent to RTA, Rangareddy, for taking action to suspend/revoke the driving licence of the said person as he is unfit to drive any kind of vehicle on public roads,’’ Cyberabad deputy commissioner of police (Traffic) Vijay Kumar said in a press note .

A criminal case has already been registered by Madhapur police against Ashwin as his blood alcohol count was 185 mg/100 ml (permissible: 30mg/100ml) when he was caught after the accident.

Cyberabad police have been recommending suspension of licence of motorists driving under the influence of alcohol and causing accidents.

463,['28/01/2020'],BBMP health officer assaulted while clearing footpath shops,"This story is from January 28, 2020

BENGALURU: A BBMP officer clearing footpath encroachments was allegedly assaulted in HSR Layout on Saturday.

Vinod G, 32, a senior health officer, Bommanahalli zone, was waiting on 18th Cross around noon for his men and machines to arrive for the weekly encroachment-clearing drive.

According to Vinod, about 25 people came to the spot and asked who the BBMP official was. When Vinod identified himself, the men attacked him. Vinod raised an alarm and the attackers dispersed once passersby rushed to his help. HSR Layout police have arrested Mani, 57, in connection with the assault and said some more people will be nabbed soon.

BBMP sources said they were conducting the drive after several residents complained about the street vendors. On Thursday, the Palike made announcements on public address systems that unauthorised shops on footpaths would be demolished.

“Some vendors were operating there after obtaining permission and they were not touched. There were people who had illegally built makeshift structures and even rented out the premises. They include food joints, garment and footwear shops. We were acting against such structures,” officials added.

Karnataka State Street Vendors Federation president Rangaswamy CE said they will hold talks with the state government about putting in place a system to prevent unauthorised street vendors from renting out spaces to other people.

464,['28/01/2020'],"Police recover 400gm gold, Rs 13.39L","This story is from January 28, 2020

Aurangabad: Pundaliknagar police, probing a major house break-in and theft case, have recovered over 400 gram of gold and Rs 13.39 lakh in cash from the three suspects.

The suspect trio includes a jeweller and two hardened property offenders heading the infamous Khidki King. They have been identified as Syed Sikandar Syed Akhtar (36), Shankar Tanhaji Jadhav (35) and Anil Shaliram Shelke (39) — the jeweller from Jalna.

The latest crime record retrieved from Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) revealed that Sikandar has 68 offences registered against him, while Shankar has over 50 offences to his name.

The suspects have claimed that the jeweller has been purchasing the stolen gold from them for some time. After being produced before the court on Monday, the trio has been remanded in judicial custody.

Addressing a press conference on Monday, Aurangabad commissioner of police Chiranjeev Prasad said the case was detected in absence of strong clues in the initial phase.

“The relentless hard work by Pundaliknagar police helped in detection as well as recovery of the stolen goods in the burglary committed on the intervening night of December 29 and 30,” Prasad said.

The suspect duo committed the crime at the house of retired civil surgeon Namdeo Kalvale.

Pundaliknagar police station’s assistant inspector Ghanshyam Sonawne said the burglars revealed that after learning about the crime through newspapers, the jeweller contacted them for buying the stolen gold.

Accordingly, on January 1, the suspects went to Jalna and sold the stolen gold against which Sikandar got Rs 15.39 lakh.

At the same time, police managed to arrest Sikandar. This was followed by the arrest of Shankar from Panchshilnagar of Nashik and jeweller’s arrest from Jalna.

465,['28/01/2020'],2 more offences registered in loan against fake gold racket,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Aurangabad: The crime branch of the city police, which is probing the racket involving mortgage of fake gold to obtain loans, registered two more offences on Monday, taking the total to seven cases.

Police authorities told TOI that the number of offences registered is only the tip of the iceberg as many more are likely to come to the fore.

The crime branch sleuths, who busted the racket while tracking down a suspected chain snatcher last week, have raised serious questions over alleged non-cooperation from banks in the probe.

“Some banks appear to be reluctant in providing information about the suspicious gold loan accounts. Their behaviour is forcing us to suspect their role in the racket,” said an officer.

Crime branch inspector Madhukar Sawant quoted the arrested suspects as saying there are many more cases of obtaining loan against fake gold.

An officer said that soon after news of the racket broke, some people cleared the loans and took back the metal they had mortgaged.

Police sources said that in each case, it appeared that the gold valuers played a role in helping the accused bag loans with different banks. A gold valuer and his brother have already been arrested.

City police commissioner Chiranjeev Prasad has asked the crime branch to reach out to all the banks across the city and check the accounts whose details have been revealed by the arrested suspects.

Accordingly, on Monday the crime branch initiated the process of contacting banks. Police confirmed that in some cases, banks have been reluctant in cooperating in the probe while citing the issue of privacy of customers.

“We have asked the banks to either summon the customers with suspicious gold loan accounts or let us video record the opening of sealed packets in the presence of two ‘panchas’ to check its authenticity,” said an officer, who had been to a bank on Monday.

466,['28/01/2020'],Rajasthan-based ATM breakers in police net,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Though four were arrested, cops are yet to nab one of the accused

Nagpur: Bahadur Bawari, 30, had formed a gang with family members in Nagor district of Rajasthan to break ATMs, so he could pay his lawyer Rs18 lakh to get possession of his sister’s 51-acre land in 2015. After numerous attempts, he had mastered the modus operandi of whisking away the entire cash vending machine from the ATM outlets. He had committed 10 such crimes in Nagpur city, rural and also Wardha district in the last three months before he was caught on Sunday.

Bahadur, whose parents and sisters are also behind bars for ATM thefts, was nabbed along with three gang members, Gopalram Bawari, Toofan Bawari and Shreeniwas Bawari, after a chase of around 32km by Local Crime Cranch (LCB) team from Patansawangi. The chase in their jeep, and then on foot, ended after the cops laid a trap for some of the gang at Nagpur railway station, after some three months of working on the crime.

The LCB team had been alerted after the theft of a light carrier vehicle from Dahegaon on January 24. They were apprehending a strike on an ATM, and they spotted the stolen vehicle in the early hours of January 26, heading from Khapa T-point to Patansawangi.

As the cops started following the light carrier vehicle, Bahadur started employing various tactics to end the chase, first by sprinkling sharp nails on the road. His team also hurled stones at the cops’ vehicle. When nothing worked, Bahadur had picked up an iron rod and pointed it at the police vehicle like a gun, forcing the cops to hesitate about moving in.

An officer said that light carrier vehicle speeding down the bad road was throwing up dust. “We could only make out the red tail-light of their vehicle. Bahadur asked his gang to slow down the vehicle a bit, and pointed the rod towards us, which appeared to be a gun through the dust. We had to take some precaution,” he said.

“Then, Bahadur jumped out of the vehicle and started running. We too ran after him and pinned him down in a nullah with the help of some villagers at Kalambi. The rest of the gang sped away in the vehicle, but abandoned it later. They managed to flee but our team reached the railway station after Bahadur told us the team was heading back to Rajasthan,” he said. “One of them had a master key in his pocket just like one we found in the abandoned vehicle, leading to their arrest,” said the officer.

Police are yet to nab one accomplice, who provided the gang logistics support and knowledge of local roads, ATM targets, and created two dens at Dhawlamethi on Nagpur-Amravati Road, and another at Wardha.

Bahadur, the mastermind, had 14 offences against him in Rajasthan, including nine for breaking ATMs. Gopalram too had eight offences in Rajasthan while Shreeniwas had 13 including nine for breaking ATMs.

LCB team under PI Anil Jittewar, Asst PI Jeetendra Vairagade, Sub-inspectors Sachin Matte, Narendra Gourkhede (Cyber) and Javed Shaikh had started chasing the gang under supervision of SP Rakesh Ola since they stole a light carrier vehicle from Dahegaon in Khaparkheda on October 11, and raided an ATM with Rs16 lakh in Katol.

After a series of such crimes, there was yet another theft of light carrier van from Dahegaon in Khaparkheda again on January 24 this year. The vehicle was traced but another one was stolen.

SP Ola said the theft of the vehicle was both an alarm and challenge for the cops, who knew there would be an attempt on an ATM soon. “The squads of LCB and police stations were alerted about a strike on ATM outlets, which led to these arrests. We are trying to recover the cash, which they had transferred to relatives after distributing it among themselves,” he said.

The gang was nabbed even though they took precautions like not using mobile phones, avoiding CCTVs and toll nakas, and also using gestures like switching vehicle light on and off to signal each other.

LCB squads comprising ASI Laxmiprasad Dubey, Baba Keche, Vipin Gaidhane, Rohan Dakhore and others were instrumental in getting the gang nabbed.

MODUS OPERANDI

* Gang would first steal a light carrier vehicle and roam around like labourers

* They would keep the vehicle for two days before attacking ATMs at desolate places in the wee hours

* They would sever ATM cables from server room

* The gang would push the machine outside before loading it in their stolen vehicle.

* The machine would be taken to their rented rooms before cutting it open with electric cutter.

467,['28/01/2020'],"GI tag for Khola chillies, govt set to put mancurad on same path","This story is from January 28, 2020

Porvorim: The state government has obtained a Geographic Indication (GI) tag for the popular Khola chillies grown by the Canacona farmers association. The government now plans to pursue GI tags for Goa’s coconut vinegar, local rice varieties, mancurad mango, Harmal chillies, Mandoli bananas and other local produce, said minister for science and technology Michael Lobo here on Monday.

The locally-grown Khola or Canacona chillies are unique owing to their brilliant red colour and medium-pungent taste. Officials of the Goa State Council of Science and Technology and the Khola chili cultivators’ group had met with scientists of the Old Goa-based Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute (CCARI) to prepare a road map for the GI registration of the Khola Chilli , which TOI reported in September 2018.

“When farmers get GI tags for their crops, they will be able to promote their produce—this is our objective. We want more youngsters in Goa to take up farming,” Lobo said.

The minister rued the lack of interest among youth, in farming and agriculture. He said that getting the GI tag was a step towards making farming profitable, which in turn could help Goa decrease its dependence on other states for food.

“Our elders are engaged in farming but our youth don’t want to take it up. When a product gets a GI tag, our youth will not only be able to sell their produce in the market, but they can also export it. That is why, the government has stepped forward to do this, and this could improve Goa’s agricultural yield,” said Lobo.

“We have got geographical indication for Khola mirchi, the first agricultural produce of the state to get this. Our department started the process some time back,” said Lobo.

Chillies were introduced to Goa by the Portuguese. Over time, the spice has undergone hybridisation, with approximately 15 varieties of chili grown in Goa, ranging from the Portugali mirsaang to the Tharvati chili, and Aldona chili.

Chandrapur: Forest officials have nabbed three poachers for electrocuting a carnivore and removing its body parts. “It can be a tiger or leopard,” said divisional forest officer (DFO) AL Sonkusre.

Acting on a tip off, Sonkusre and his team arrested three accused — Suresh Gedam, Ramesh Bhoyar and Ajay Meshram from Kapsi village. “A month ago, the trio had drawn illegal power from an overhead 11kv electric line in compartment number 201 in Saoli forest range to kill a wild boar. Both the wild boar and a carnivore were killed,” said Sonkusre.

Sonkusre said over 2kg bones and skull have been recovered. More seizures are likely. The accused have been remanded to forest custody till February 1.

In another development, the Butibori forest officials have launched a manhunt for killers of a full-grown leopard that was dumped in Nand Lake on Friday. “There is no direct or indirect evidence to show that the leopard approached the water body. It seems the animal was killed at some other spot and body dumped in the lake,” said RFO LV Thokal.

The liquid from 75,000 metric tonnes of the garbage is percolating and this liquid is causing the unbearable stench. “We are planning to generate electricity from methane gas emanating from these liquids,” the commissioner said. “We will come up with one electricity plant in the next two and half months and a second plant, too, will come up three months thereafter.”Lokesh Kumar said, “We are covering this huge dump in layers of polythene and mud, and have laid as many 150 pipelines to allow the gas to come out of the garbage. And this gas will be raw material for our power plant. This is apart from a compost processing unit, a negative vacuum unit and a waste water treatment plant we have to deal with the problem.“We will allow the dump to dry for a week so that the garbage becomes fit for treatment. We have to drain the liquid lagoon at the bottom first to cement the bottom of the dump yard, to prevent the liquid seeping into the groundwater.

470,['28/01/2020'],Village bestows flag hoisting honour on sanitation worker,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Aurangabad: As a mark of respect to the sanitation employee, who has been working in a village for the past 28 years, residents of that village in Jalna district asked him to hoist the flag on Sunday.

Tirthapuri, a village which has a population of 20,000, is known for its sugar factory. The village, situated in Ghansawngi taluka of Jalna district, is considered to be the most vibrant market in the taluka.

Sanitation staffer Laxman Namdeo Kasar has been cleaning gutters and lanes of Tirthpuri for almost three decades.

The decision to honour Kasar was taken by the village sarpanch Shailendra Pawar. A day before of Republic Day, Pawar spoke to his colleagues in gram panchayat and decided on it. Pawar, on Saturday, went to Kasar, who initially thought that the sarpanch has come to ask him to wake up early to clean the gutters and drains in the village on the occasion of the Republic Day.

When contacted, Pawar said, “Sanitary staffers are the unsung heroes of our society, so instead of inviting some politician for flag hoisting, we decided to invite our sanitary staffer.”

On Saturday evening, after Pawar took Kasar to a barber to get him a haircut, Kasar asked the reason behind it. On hearing the reply, Kasar did not believe him, but still followed the instructions of the sarpanch. Accordingly, the sarpanch got him a Khadi cloth so that he can hoist the flag in it. Kasar was felicitated with before being invited to hoist the flag.

Kasar said, “During festive seasons and on the days of national importance, we are expected to wake up early and clean the drains. Even bagging any national award would not have made me happier than getting this honour.”

Kasar said that for the past 30 years, he has never even stood in the first row during any of the official functions of the gram panchayat. He added that his experience of hoisting the flag is a reward for his service.

471,['28/01/2020'],High court quashes FIR against three,"This story is from January 28, 2020

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court recently quashed an FIR filed against three people — a police inspector, an education officer and a headmaster of a school in Himayatnangar taluka of Nanded district.

Following the registration of an offence, the trio approached the high court seeking to quash the FIR registered against them under sections 341, 353, 467, 468, 469, 201 and 120 B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

The case was registered against the trio in 2019 by 38-year-old Anand Uttamrao Bawane, an assistant teacher working at the zilla parishad-run school in Rukmini Nagar of Himayatnagar taluka.

The petitioners approached the high court through lawyer Sudarshan J Salunke challenging the FIR. In his complaint, Bawane said he worked as assistant teacher at the zilla parishad school. On September 25, 2014, he was served a suspension notice at his residence at 9am. He also alleged that a false record was created by the petitioners showing that he was suspended with effect from September 5, 2014.

Bawane said that when he reached school on September 25 and started teaching a class, two policemen arrived there and physically lifted him saying that the police officer had asked them to bring him to the police station.

The police officer said that it was done at the behest of block education officer and the headmaster. Bawane alleged that the police officer abused him and asked him to sit in a corner and meted out insulting treatment.

He later approached the higher police officer and the collectorate against the trio but nothing was done. Finally, Bawane approached the judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) on March 20, 2015 who ordered an investigation into the case under section 156(3) of the CrPC. Later, a crime was registered against the trio on July 19, 2019.

“Initially, the order was not made by the JMFC and the order came to be made in criminal revision by the additional sessions judge Bhokar,” the court high said.

Following arguments, the bench comprising justices TV Nalawade and MG Swewlikar allowed the petition and observed that, “It can be said that by filing the FIR, he (the complainant) is trying to put pressure on the education officer, head master and even the police officer who took aforesaid step. Allowing the informant to prosecute the matter would amount to misuse of the process of law.’’

He claimed that not all members were consulted while drafting the motion and that some suggestions for amendments to the motion were rejected by fellow Liberal Democrat MP Shaffaq Mohammed.“The call for censure has been led by a small group of British members, unfortunately from my own party, in an attempt to create a rift between the two blocs.

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla wrote to president of European parliament David Sassoli on Monday, asking him to “respect the sovereign processes of fellow legislatures” and refrain from passing the proposed resolution over CAA and thus prevent setting an “unhealthy precedent”.

In his letter, Birla said: “As members of the Inter Parliamentary Union, we should respect the sovereign processes of fellow legislatures , especially democracies. It is inappropriate for one legislature to pass judgement on another, a practice that can surely be misused by vested interests.”

Birla’s concerns were echoed by Vice President and Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu who said there is “no scope for outside interference in India’s internal matters”.
