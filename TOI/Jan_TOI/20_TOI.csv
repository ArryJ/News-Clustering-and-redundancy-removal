What’s interesting is that they have created an animated version of late MG Ramachandran (MGR), who will be playing the lead character, Vanthiyathevan, in the film, which has been titled Vanthiyathevan: Ponniyin Selvan – Volume 1. Actor and politician, late MGR , had tried to turn the novel into a film in 1958, and had even finalised a multi-star cast, but the project remained an unrealised dream due to various reasons.“It is impossible to capture the richness of Kalki’s prose in visuals in live-action unless you have a big budget, like what Mani Ratnam is doing now. We do not have such a budget, so we decided to go with animation. MGR was the first actor who wanted to adapt it for the big screen, so we decided to have him as the lead character by recreating him through motion capture,” says Dhavachelvan, who has scripted and directed this film. The dialogues and lyrics (the film will have four songs) are written by Madhan Karky. The team brought in performers who act like MGR and captured their motions. “Obviously, they could not perform exactly like MGR. We captured their actions and refined them in the key animation stage,” he reveals.They have also created an animated character resembling Jayalalithaa for the female lead’s role, but since they aren’t sure of the legality over using the late actress-politician’s likeness, they have also created another character that is vaguely like Jayalalithaa. The rest of the characters aren’t based on any personality, adds the filmmaker.The motion capture technology was earlier employed in Rajinikanth’s Kochadaiiyaan. Given that that film’s budget ran into crores, how was it possible for this team to make an entire film using this technology in a smaller budget? Dhavachelvan answers, “We are clear that our Ponniyin Selvan is for the Indian market and not for the international market. To be frank, we cannot compete with international animated films. We have managed to maintain a quality that will seem agreeable for the budget that we have worked on.”While Kochadaiiyaan was criticised for the quality of its animation, the director says he and his team have used a different workflow and the movie has been made indigenously entirely. “We have made this film from start to finish in Chennai, with 126 people being part of our team,” informs Dhavachelvan, who has a computer science background. “We researched for two years before beginning production,” he adds.The entire project has taken the team four years. “Ponniyin Selvan has five volumes, and we have completed animating the first volume into a feature film of 2 hours 20 minutes’ duration. The post-production work is going on,” says the director, who informs that apart from Tamil, he intends to release the film in the other three south Indian languages, and in Hindi. “We have not decided on releasing it in English. Even if we do, we will opt for subtitles instead of dubbing the film in the language,” he says.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75/47529300.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/now-ponniyin-selvan-becomes-an-animated-film-starring-mgr/articleshow/73380344.cms
1,['20/01/2020'],Sruthi Hariharan: My awards have helped me bring back my self-confidence,"While actress Sruthi Hariharan insists that coming out with her #MeToo story early last year was one of the bravest things she has done, she also admits that she never expected it to turn her life completely upside down. “Suddenly, I was out of projects for various reasons. The teams of films that I had worked on and were ready for release had a tough time trying to figure out distribution. In fact, there are still ready-to-be-released films stuck without a release date. The film industry itself split into two groups — those who believed me and those who didn’t. So many people whom I considered my friends stopped being friends,” she tells us slowly. Incidentally, it is one of the films that hit the screens after she disclosed her story that has brought Sruthi back into the limelight. She has not only picked up the critics’ award for her performance in Naaticharami at the Filmfare , but she is also waiting for the clearance of a case against the film’s win at the national level before she takes her award for the same there as well. And in the meantime, in the midst of the career turmoil, it is her personal life and motherhood that has taken precedence.""My husband, Raam (Kumar), and I welcomed a new member in our family — a baby girl who has beautifully taken over our lives. I guess everything happens for the good,” says Sruthi. Bangalore Times caught up with the actress at her home in the city, while she attended to little Janaki even as she calmly took on a volley of questions. Excerpts…I am exalted. The film did not see a very good box office because of the climate in which it was released. I had just come out with my #MeToo story. The storyline, by itself, is compelling. It’s also very close to my heart. So, when it did not perform so well, I personally took the responsibility for that. But now that it’s receiving critical acclaim, it is quite a reprise. I am exalted with the National Awards and simultaneously with the Filmfare. Somewhere, I feel like our effort has been validated and, at some level, I do think that hard work and honesty pay off. It has brought back my confidence and the faith to continue doing what I love to do.It has turned my life upside down. Coming out with my story was not an instinctive move, I had thought about it for more than a month. Tanushree Dutta had told her story in Bollywood, so had Chinmayi in the south. People were asking why isn’t anyone in the Kannada film industry saying anything. Is this place safe? But no industry really is ‘safe’. I did go into this whole process of introspection and questioned myself about the repercussions of coming out, too. Then, finally, I had to say it and I did, through social media. It was never the way I imagined it to be. Not only did the newspapers and news channels completely turn my story upside down, the film industry itself did not receive it well at all. It split the industry into two parts, and ultimately it became like who is right, who is wrong, who do you believe and who don’t you believe? It became this dirty game, and that is something that I had never foreseen.I wanted to stop being guilty by not speaking up. The industry is really not safe for women. At some level, I also wanted to make sure that this man does not behave like how he behaved with me ever again. What I understand is that him, and the other predators are victims of the system that has existed for so long that it makes them believe that it is okay for them to behave the way they do. Yes, I am calling them victims of the system. They think it is alright. They have wives and daughters, but do they take a step back and think about the way the behave? I don’t think they do. It is important at some level that as women, we raise our voice and say, hey it is not okay anymore. Because the more we keep quiet, it is like our silence is allowing them to continue to think that what they are doing is alright.Silence is safe; it is easy to be quiet. But we live in dangerous times and if we don’t come together and stand up for what is right — it is only going to be a ride downhill. I think it is important that we voice our opinion, even if it is an unpopular one.I expected it to become news. But did I expect to not have work anymore? No. Did I expect my entire credibility to be washed out? No. Did I expect this market that we actors have when our films are released, to completely be gone? No. I did not expect any of that.I have always believed in the secret that YOU make things happen and that it comes from within you. But the past one year has been completely out of my hands, and I haven’t been able to control anything that happened. And, in a way, I have surrendered. I have learnt to let go, and go with the flow so I could believe in something much bigger. It has been a great spiritual journey for me.I do have friends in the industry who call and say, whenever you’re ready to get back to work we should collaborate, but then the universe so had it in a way that I had to have my daughter now.With respect to the legal case, it is still in court. The defamation suit that they had filed was never Rs 5 crore, as reported in media. There was no money at all. The criminal case I have filed is also in limbo, between the police and the court. So legally, I have understood that unless I pursue it actively, nothing is going to come out of it.No, I am not.I do not know how much the justice system can help to ascertain my truth. I don’t know whether legal justice is what I seek. To be clear, legal justice is not what I seek. What I seek is what I have got. What I wanted, I got, the moment I put my post out there. For me, that was the end of it. I did not start the battle and the war. I know this is the same for every single woman who came out in every single industry. It has come to a dead end. But honestly, that is all we seek. We seek awareness of the fact that sexual harassment exists. We seek awareness in terms of behaviour. How men and women need to behave in the work space. So I guess, that’s already done. So, do I seek legal justice? I do not. It became a legal case only after the defamation suit was filed, and I had to retaliate. It takes money and time from my end and a lot of emotional and mental trauma to go out there and continue fighting a battle that I never wanted in the first place. Hence, I don’t see the need. I am at peace in my little world, with my family and I am very excited about the kind of work I can create henceforth, rather than fight a battle that I do not know if I will win.Yes, it is very disheartening. But it is the truth. I remember meeting Bhanwari Devi at a conference recently and she told me “Don’t give up. Zor se lado”. She has been fighting for 42 years. She was gangraped. What happened to me is not 1% of what she went through. Then I came back home and thought, is this worth my time, my energy and my emotions? But, I do intend to use my voice in a different manner, to set things straight.There are times when I sit alone and think to myself, that if had kept quiet, how different would life be. I don’t regret having come out, I don’t regret having spoken the truth. It has given me a lot of strength. I had said this before I had my daughter — that I am doing this because if ever I have a daughter, I want to see a better and a safer world for her. If I have not tried to make a difference, then I am being a hypocrite. So that way, I do not regret. But, I am human, and I am a real person; I have gone through my share of depression because of this, I have, therefore, taken professional help. I do introspect, I think that things would have probably been different. I see some amazing cinema being made, and I do think I probably could have been a part of it... if things did not pan out the way they did.I think it calls for a celebration that so many awards were won by Kannada films at the National Awards this year. For one film to win five awards was also huge. Yet, it’s very sad that even the people within our industry are not letting our own industry grow. It was quite unnecessary of him to file that complaint. I think the intent of the case was very immature and uncalled for. The only way we could have attended the awards was if we apologised. Why would any of us (the five who won the awards) do that? It’s not the truth. We know that we will win the case and at some point, we will receive these awards.My mother is a single parent. And I have grown up most of my adult life without my father in my life. I have seen my mother pine for my father in many ways than one. The process of letting go of a person from your life is never complete. It is a void that always exists. And that is the core of Naaticharami. In Sanskrit, it means ‘I shall never let you go’, and it is a promise that you make when you take your vows in the marital ceremony. The film is about the process of letting go. One of the important aspect of letting go is the physical aspect of it. And we as women are naturally more monogamous. But at some level, there exists this sexual desire which is important to be addressed. In the Indian society, for a woman to speak about her desire continues to be taboo. It was intriguing for me to play Gowri in this film, because I constantly had my mother at the back of my mind. I don’t think any other form of preparation was required for this role. The character was only required to react to the situation. She was never the cause of the situation; she was only the aftermath of it. And the story was a very personal one. Luckily for me, our director ( Manjunatha Somashekara Reddy , also known as Mansore) was a man who was open to collaboration. I am glad that he, who chose to say a woman’s story, had the sensitivity and the feministic perspective to show such a subject aesthetically. At no point was I uncomfortable doing certain scenes, because there are scenes that can make you squirm in your seat. There is a scene that we imply upon masturbation. It is high time films talked about it. There was a lot of discussion about how these scenes ought to be shot and that is how it should be. It was actually, quite liberating for me as an actor to perform something this real. I look back at Naaticharami with a lot of fond memories and happiness that I could portray a real woman on screen.I am a Bengaluru girl. I grew up here, I know the culture, I know the energy that exists here. I think it’s very personal for me to be part of stories that come from Bengaluru. And it is so easy for me to play them. Be it Sahana in Godhi Banna Sadharana Mykattu, Nandini in Beautiful Manasugalu or even Gowri in Naaticharami, they have been real women. I do not see myself anywhere else, and I say this in spite of being a Tamilian and in spite of being married to a Malayali.For me, the choice to be married or not married was a very personal one. I have always been committed to the man I am now married to, for the last 10 years. Marriage was something that happened for our families. They wanted us to make it official. And when it happened, it was a very small gathering in Dubai. After that, I carried on with my work. I had enough films in the pipeline. It was a personal celebration and it remained that way. I did not have the opportunity or the time to make it a huge announcement in social media or through the media. Hence, it remained under wraps. ‘Very conveniently’ — a lot of people may think. So be it, I really don’t care. But when it did come out, I honestly breathed a sigh of relief. Because I understand a public figure’s life is invariably public. Though I come from a middle-class family, I have to accept at some point of time that I am a public figure and I cannot just have a personal life. It came out the way it did, and I am glad it did.Right now, I have taken a sabbatical. Somehow, priorities have changed post motherhood. But there are offers, and I am looking at how I can be involved without letting it affect my time with my daughter. There is a bit of writing too, that has happened. We have all been talking about how women should start getting into different departments of film making, how it is imperative to make sensitive cinema, through women. This is also the right time to slowly transition into that. So yes, I would be starting off fresh, maybe, not so much as an actor, but at least as a writer/assistant director. I cannot wait to pull up my socks and get back to work. It wasn’t easy to get to where I was. It was a journey of making all kinds of random choices, of seeing success and failure; and I know that it is only a matter of time to get to that peak — with a little more of hard work.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73378410,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-160806/73378410.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/sruthi-hariharan-my-awards-have-helped-me-bring-back-my-self-confidence/articleshow/73377976.cms
2,['20/01/2020'],Taking Carnatic music to the younger generation,"It was a regular Saturday evening for most of us, but not for the rasikas who’d gathered at the auditorium of Music Academy. After all, it was the grand finale of the 9th edition of the Times Thyagaraja Awards , which would be followed by a spell-binding kutcheri by Sangeetha Kalanidhi Padma Shri Aruna Sairam . The audience — which included family and friends of the six finalists, as well as connoisseurs of Carnatic music — waited with bated breath for the participants to showcase their vocal prowess on stage and also find out who took home the coveted title. After several rounds of auditions and a gruelling semi-final elimination round, Pranathi Ganapuram, Jaya Bargavi S, Samanvi, Purva Dhanashree Cotah, Kausthubh P Chandramouli and Srividya Vadlamani made it to the grand finale. The six finalists performed to the best of their abilities, each one exploring a raga. They were ably accompanied by Shreelakshmi Bhatt (on violin) and Sarvajit Krishna (on mridangam).It was a tough competition, and our judges for the evening — Kalaimamani Bhushani Kalyanaraman Kalaimamani Dr Shobana Vignesh , Aruna Ranganathan, Viji Krishnan and Chinmaya Sisters, Uma and Radhika — admitted they had a tough time choosing the winners.Based on raga, niraval and swaram, Samanvi (nominated by Arkay Convention Centre) was announced the winner of Times Thyagaraja Awards and she received the trophy, certificate and gift voucher worth a lakh from Aruna Sairam. While Kausthubh P Chandramouli (nominated by Carnatica) was adjudged the first runner-up, Srividya Vadlamani (nominated by Arkay Convention Centre) won both the second runner-up position and Rasikas Choice Award for getting the maximum views for the audition video in the Times Thyagaraja Awards’ Facebook page. The other finalists were also awarded with certificates and gift vouchers.Speaking on the occasion, Shobana said, “They are all immensely talented and have it in them to make it big. I’m happy to be associated with the Times Thyagaraja Awards, which takes Carnatic music to the young generation.”While Geetha Raja said it was a delight to see young students perform, Viji Krishnan added, “It’s amazing how these kids brought out that kutcheri effect within 16 minutes that each one of them were given to perform. As artistes, we know how difficult it is to please everyone in the audience, but I’m sure these youngsters have done it.”On her part, Uma said, “The Times Thyagaraja Awards motivates youngsters and gives them the courage to perform in front of public. The preparation and hard work they put in not only helped them in this competition, but will also help them blossom into a wholesome artiste.”Radhika added, “It’s not an easy task to sing in front of so many people, but these youngsters did it with confidence.”Bhushani Kalyanaraman had a suggestion for the participants. “Azhutham thiruthamana ragathila concentrate pannanum. I urge them to choose kritis that can be challenging to perform.” Aruna Ranganathan said, “Times of India, chance-eyilla! The journey of a student begins when his/her parents decide to teach them music and find them a good guru. Both of these, I think, are divine interventions. Every kriti they chose to sing was taught to them by their gurus… that’s what foundation is all about. I’d like to convey my wishes to the students, their gurus and their parents, who are so passionate about music.”It was then time for Aruna Sairam to take the stage. Accompanied by Kalaimamani J Vaidyanathan (on mridangam), Vittal Rangan (on violin), Dr S Karthick (on ghatam) and Seethalakshmi (on tanpura), the ace artiste wowed audience with her rendition of soulful kritis like Ganamoorthe, Amba Sauramba, Soundara Raajam Ashraye, Sabhapathikku and the ever-favourite, Theertha Vittala. Her flawless energy engulfed the rasikas,who lost themselves in the beautiful sound of music.Music lovers can watch the grand finale performances on www.facebook.com/TimesThyagarajaAwards/",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75/47529300.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/music/taking-carnatic-music-to-the-younger-generation/articleshow/73380823.cms
3,['20/01/2020'],A 20-minute art face-off between Bengaluru artists,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Bengaluru witnessed a quirky riot of colours over the weekend — one that involved the easel, music and a lot of fun. Some 12 artists competed against each other to bag the top slot at the maiden edition of Art Battle Bengaluru. The live painting global tournament saw several art lovers come together to encourage and support the cause of art.

Speaking about the first edition of the event in namma ooru, Pooja Shirali , an organiser, said, “We got to know about this global tournament from a friend, who had participated in the Seattle chapter of it. We found out that this is the world’s largest live art tournament, which takes place in more than 60 cities. But, apparently, it had never happened in India before, which is why we wanted to do this here.”

There were two rounds in the competition, two winners from which were then pitted against each other in the final round. As the artists continued painting, the audiences moved around them in a circle, viewing each artist in action. The winners were chosen by the audience. “The artists weren’t given any theme to follow. They could paint whatever they wanted to, within a time frame of 20 minutes. We did have applicants from other cities as well, but for the first edition, we decided to have only local artists,” says Kaavya Sampath, another organiser.

Nanvi Singh Jhala — a student of Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology — was the youngest participant in the art event. Sharing her experience, Nanvi said, “It was both crazy and intense to compete live in front of an audience, with music playing in the background. But I enjoyed the vibe of it. We should have more of such events in the city, as they open the door to many opportunities.”

Chetan S Murthy, a professional artist from Bengaluru, was declared the winner, after he bagged maximum audience votes. He will now compete on the national level. The winner at the national level will then compete at the international tournament, which is scheduled to be held in Tokyo , Japan , in October this year.

4,['20/01/2020'],Sunny Hinduja to do a cameo in TV show 'Mere Dad Ki Dulhan',"There are very few actors who would agree to do a TV show while working in films, but actor Sunny Hinduja sees it as an opportunity that he got to play a role in the TV show ' Mere Dad Ki Dulhan '. The actor, who was last seen in ' Mardaani 2', will make an entry in the show featuring Varun Badola and Shweta Tiwari , this week. He will be seen as Dr Anurag Malhotra, a 43-year-old orthopaedic surgeon who will try to impress Guneet Sikka (Shweta Tiwari). ""Anurag is a single parent who is looking for a companion for himself and a mother for his daughter. I found the character very relatable. He is looking for a companion for his old age and Guneet comes across as someone who will be perfect for him,"" shares Sunny.One of the reasons why Sunny agreed to do the show was that it was an interesting cameo. ""I have done TV shows earlier, but only those that do not go on for years or have an interesting concept. I agreed to do this show since the role was a cameo and the show is not the usual saas-bahu saga. I was looking forward to do something interesting on TV. Fortunately, I had some time before I start shooting for other projects, so this looked like an opportunity in every way,"" says the actor, who says that he doesn’t mind being a part of TV shows that have some realistic content. ""While working in films, I don’t mind doing TV shows as long as I am associating with something that is realistic and is a finite series,"" he adds.Working with actors like Varun Badola and Shweta Tiwari was also something that inspired Sunny to take up the show. ""They are both very good actors. I have seen their shows and to work with them is a privilege,"" he says.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73376649,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-140076/73376649.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/sunny-hinduja-to-do-a-cameo-in-tv-show-mere-dad-ki-dulhan/articleshow/73376702.cms
5,['20/01/2020'],Chandana Ananthakrishna turns host for Haadu Karnataka,"In just over a week since her ouster from this season of Bigg Boss Kannada , Chandana Ananthakrishna has already bagged her next gig. The actress has been signed up to host the music show, Haadu Karnataka, which will hit TV screens soon. Raghu Dixit and V Harikrishna will serve as judges on the show. Chandana tell us, “I am excited about my new journey as a host. I’ve always wanted to be a television host, but when I got the opportunity to work on Raja Rani (which marked her first stint on a TV show), I took it up. Being a host requires different set of skills, and I have already started practising at home to get the language and mannerisms right. Once the show starts, I don’t want to go wrong. I admire Akul Balaji and Srujan Lokesh for their energy and spontaneity as hosts, which is something that I am going to try for Haadu Karnataka. The only issue is that making the contestants feel comfortable may be a challenge, as each of them comes from a different socio-economic background. I also need to work on striking a rapport with the judges as well. Also, considering that it is a music show, I think the fact that I have briefly trained in Carnatic music could come in handy while hosting the show.”According to a source from the show, the title track for Haadu Karnataka has been written by Vasuki Vaibhav. The show will have representations from all the 30 districts of Karnataka. Singers between the ages of 6 and 60 are eligible to participate. The show will kick-start with just over 30 contestants, which will include singers with and without formal training.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73378530,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-268791/73378530.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/kannada/chandana-ananthakrishna-turns-host-for-haadu-karnataka/articleshow/73378536.cms
6,['20/01/2020'],"I was offered Maidaan in December, I’ll shoot from January end: Priyamani","The year 2020 looks packed for Priyamani. The actress, who’s shooting for a handful of films, including the Telugu remake of Asuran with Venkatesh, has just signed on a new film — Maidaan with Ajay Devgn. Interestingly, Priyamani replaces Keerthy Suresh in the Amit Ravindernath Sharma (of Badhaai Ho fame) directorial, which would have marked her Bollywood debut.Priyamani, who was shooting in a forest in Kerala, tells us, “Boney Kapoor sir approached me for the film; I got this offer in December. I met director Amit at Boneyji’s office. He told me the gist of the story and gave me a brief about my role. The way Amit narrated the character drew me in and I just couldn’t say no. I’ll start shooting for my portions by January end.”Maidaan will trace the golden years of Indian football and has Ajay Devgn playing football coach Syed Abdul Rahim . The actress will be playing Ajay’s wife in the film. “It feels so good to play a real-life character on the big screen. I’m looking forward to working with Ajay Devgn sir and Amit, and of course under Boney sir’s production,” she says.Interestingly, Priyamani is said to be playing Sasikala in Vijay’s Thalaivi, a biopic of actress and former CM of Tamil Nadu, J Jayalalithaa. Ask her if she had to work the shoot schedule of her other films to accommodate this one and she says, “I can’t comment on Thalaivi now, but fortunately, my husband and my manager both worked out the dates to ensure a smooth shoot for the entire crew of Maidaan and Asuran remake so that dates don’t clash.”A source in the know tells us that Keerthy shot for a day for the sports drama in October before both she and the makers mutually decided to part ways. The source says, “Keerthy was to play Ajay’s wife and a mother. But she had lost a lot of weight from the time she had committed to the film to when she shot in October, and hence, didn’t look the part. So, she opted out of the film. However, there’s no bad blood and the production house is hoping to collaborate with her soon for another project.”We also hear that date clash was another factor that prompted Keerthy’s decision. “The film didn’t go on floors as planned because casting took a while; the makers wanted every character to look authentic. And now, Keerthy’s dates were clashing with those that she had allotted for her other films in the south, including Rajinikanth’s movie with Siva, and she felt it would be in the best interest of both her and the makers of Maidaan that she opt out,” another source tells us.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73380039,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-305809/73380039.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/i-was-offered-maidaan-in-december-ill-shoot-from-january-end-priyamani/articleshow/73380039.cms

11,['20/01/2020'],Neena Gupta: I didn’t do anything with the thought that I want to go against society,"It took Neena Gupta years of waiting and a social media post to gradually reclaim her place as one India's finest actresses; a point she proved with her performance in the National Award winner, Badhaai Ho. She’s now one of her generation’s busiest actresses. It’s not the screen time that matters to her. It’s what the story is trying to say. Ahead of Panga ’s release, she spoke to BT about expressing herself through social media and deriving strength to live life on her own terms. ExcerptsIt’s an important story. The character, though small, is that of a mother and offers an interesting, realistic take. You often hear mothers saying, “Bas, ab hum tere liye kuch nahi karenge.” But when the need arises, she is the first to jump to her children’s rescue. Yeh aur baat hai ki yeh Jaya ke comeback ki kahani hai; in our country, women are not encouraged to take on sports as a career, especially when it’s something niche like kabaddi, quintessentially known as the guys’ game. That underlying discussion in the film impressed me.Cuts in…It’s a societal thing -- a big chunk of society still believes ki ek accha ladka mil jaaye beti ko, haath peele kar dein, bacche ho jaayein, ghar sambhal le. People still think that women are meant for this. In 99 percent cases, this is the reason a woman doesn’t get the push and encouragement when she needs it. Traditionally, our society has always seen women as homemakers and men as bread-earners. The demarcations are engraved in stone, perhaps.I didn’t do anything with the thought that I want to go against society or bend any rules. This is how I am and in spite of being like that, I pushed my daughter Masaba to get married to her lover, instead of having a live-in relationship. This dichotomy has to do with the way I have been brought up. Even though I did things which were not in accordance with the society’s norms, deep down, I am an orthodox woman. I have changed with the times, lekin khurech ke dekhoge toh, kahin na kahin you will find that orthodox woman inside me. In a way, it’s good because I don’t get carried away with things. Circumstances are changing for women but it’s scary because men are not changing at the same pace, which can lead to trouble. Women are independent and not taking sh*t from men anymore. When they didn’t have their financial independence, they had to put up with everything the man said. Nahin to kahan jaati woh? That’s not the case now.From myself! I look after myself, I’m disciplined and honest. I don’t say one thing and do another. You have to put your foot down and reach out for what you want. Life is too short to wait for someone to bring it to you. Today, everyone’s life today is complicated. Nanak dukhiya sab sansar...there’s pain and trouble everywhere you go. I’m happy even with my complicated life. If something untoward happens, I cry for days and weeks, but I move on. It’s not as if I forget my pain but I move on. It’s a difficult and stressful life that we all lead but I have learnt to see happiness even in my unhappiness.I don’t think I had to pass on these lessons. She’s seen me fighting my own battles throughout. Of course, she is her own person. You know how mothers feel when they see their daughter separating from her husband. At that time, she and I were in pain, but we moved on. Each time that I feel low, I loudly tell myself, ‘Chal aage chal Neena!’ You have to do that.It comes organically to me. I love acting and I am the happiest when I am playing an interesting character. For me, enacting a part means being in the character’s avatar, feeling the lines that I am saying and listening to the co-actor for actions and reactions. My experiences and observations also come in handy. I make a mental note of things I see and hear around me.The real difference occurs when people start approaching me with more and better quality of work. That’s the real kick.Yes, it did. People may have reasons to detest social media, but it gave me a lot. When I wrote that note on my page, and I started meeting people after that, they seemed so moved. They actually felt bad that I could write something like that, sensing the frustration with which I wrote it. Anubhav Sinha was the first to approach me with Mulk. And then, many filmmakers came around and things changed. The last two years have been busy and a lot of fun.(Laughs!) That statement was taken out of context. Galat samajh liya mujhe. Fact is that there are a lot of roles meant for younger women and far lesser roles for older women. The backstory is that, much before I wrote that post, I had messaged Anurag Kashyap . I had heard that he was making Saand Ki Aankh. I wrote to him saying that it’s a good role for me. He replied saying that even though he would have cast me, the financers wanted younger actors for it. So, it is not me or anyone else who decides these things. So, who am I to take offence? I was only expressing a wish -- I meant to say that I wish I could do that film kyunki itne acche roles aur scripts kam aate hain. That was made out to be something else. Bhumi Pednekar and Taapsee Pannu did a fantastic job. Even I did older women roles when I was 28. I’ve been playing older characters for many years. Kya bhool gaye hain sab? Actors find it difficult to get great roles. If I was in Bhumi and Taapsee’s shoes, even I would have jumped at that script. The mistake I made was to put up something that was in my heart on a public platform. You need to be cautious with social media.I was always like this -- one moment in a sari and the next moment in a pair of shorts (laughs!). People have not seen me like this because of the work I was doing. Remember, I was playing older characters? I was always clad in saris or salwar suits. Social media has given me a chance to show the world that this is also something that I can do.Sometimes, I wear Masaba’s creations or take her inputs, and sometimes, I wear my own outfits. Like the yellow dress I wore in the video posted on January 1, is my own. I just believe that there is no harm in flaunting what you know is good about your body. Like I know I don’t have a bikini body, so I won’t flaunt it. The surprise in seeing me in a certain way has to do with years of conditioning.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73380212,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-204335/73380212.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/neena-gupta-i-didnt-do-anything-with-the-thought-that-i-want-to-go-against-society/articleshow/73380208.cms

16,['20/01/2020'],Not just in the mind: Fear of falling ill is also an illness,"Do you frequently worry about suffering from a grave illness even when there is no real reason to do so? If you have some affliction, do you inadvertently exaggerate the symptoms? It is possible that you have hypochondriasisMost of us worry about our health from time to time, and sometimes unnecessarily so. However, for some people, worrying takes on a much larger proportion – so much so, that they are overcome by a debilitating, overpowering and crippling fear – that of falling sick. Hypochondriasis, referred to in the latest Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders as an Illness Anxiety Disorder, is the fear of getting a life threatening physical illness despite repeated medical assurances against it. ""It is natural to worry about one's health at times, but if the fear becomes so strong that it disrupts one's daily life, causing interference in work and social functioning, it signals a deeper problem. Illness Anxiety Disorder is characterised by a preoccupation with the fear of getting or already having a serious disease,"" says Sonakshi Gandhi, clinical psychologist. Megha Aggarwal, a research scholar in psychology, adds, ""Since the complaints concern the physical health of the patient, the first and foremost step is to get those symptoms evaluated by a general physician. If the physician feels that the symptoms are not related to a concrete physical illness, they may refer the person to a mental health professional.""According to experts, the defining symptoms of the disorder are:1. Persistent preoccupation with the fear or idea of having one or more serious diseases or deformities and misinterpreting the symptoms. 2. Not feeling reassured by the results of medical evaluations, even though tests do not identify adequate physical explanation for the believed disease.3. Refusal to accept advice and reassurance by doctors.4. Worrying excessively about a specific medical condition because it runs in the family.5. Repeatedly checking the body for signs of illness or disease and an increased sensitivity to bodily functions.6. Avoiding people, places or activities for fear of health risks7. Frequently searching the internet for causes, symptoms or possible illnesses.""Hypochondriasis is a disorder of cognition and perception. Misinterpretation of body sensations is an essential aspect of it, which happens when an individual has had past experiences with illness (with themselves and/or others) that may lead to development of faulty assumptions aboutsymptoms and diseases,"" says Aditi Bansal, a clinical psychologist. Other explanations for this disorder, as per experts are:People who have a close relative with hypochondriasis are more likely to develop it themselves.Other psychiatric disorders have been linked to this disorder. A high percentage of patients with hypochondriasis also have depression, panic disorder, OCD, or generalised anxiety disorder.Also known as cyberchondria, this refers to a condition where one identifies their symptoms with a chronic disease based on the information available online or in other forms of media.The disorder can also develop in response to overprotective parentingPriyanka Malhotra Kathuria, visiting psychologist in the Indian Air Force, Rajokri, Delhi, points out, ""Most patients are okay waiting in long queues for physical check-ups. But it is difficult to convince them to visit a psychologist or a psychiatrist as they're either unaware of this disorder or are unwilling to accept that their problem could have psychological explanations."" Adds Aditi, ""Since the, the referrals that come to mental health professionals are limited in number, and, the follow ups are not regular.""Therapists say that while the stigma attached to mental health is significantly reducing, there is still a need for awareness and acceptance. ""Many patients seek validation from theirThis does not work in the long run. Family members should instead help the person see a pattern in their questions and urge them to consult a specialist rather than rely on them or the internet,"" says Sonakshi.According to Dr Naina Kapoor, a Delhi-based counselling psychologist, treatments for the disorder include several options:1. If the condition is not severe, simply discussing about the fear of the illness helps. But, in most cases,is considered the first step to overcome health related anxiety.2.is one of the most effective therapy for Illness Anxiety Disorder. CBT experts aim to assist the patient in recognising, and then reducing the behaviours associated with hypochondria most efficiently.3. Being physically and mentally active, and exercising, helps in releasing stress and balance the energy. It helps the patients view the disorder in a positive light and is one of the safest and most natural ways to overcome the health anxiety.4. The patient as well as their family members should join groups where patients suffering from the disorder get together to discuss and exchange their experiences. Sharing views can help to a great extent, especially in determining the strategies to manage the disorder.Those with Illness Anxiety Disorder are also said to be involved in a behaviour pattern termed as 'Doctor Shopping'. Megha says, ""Illness Anxiety Disorder patients are often involved in 'Doctor Shopping', i.e. visiting multiple healthcare professionals in the hopes to find an answer for the physical symptoms.

17,['20/01/2020'],"Govt moves to limit duty-free alcohol to 1 bottle, slash number of cigarettes","Representational photo.

NEW DELHI: The commerce and industry ministry has proposed to reduce the number of alcohol bottles and cigarette packets that a passenger can buy at duty-free outlets when returning from an overseas trip, while also seeking a cut in the value of goods and gifts that one can get in without paying duty, which is currently fixed at Rs 50,000.While the number of alcohol bottles that can be bought from duty-free outlets is proposed to be halved from the current two, the number of cigarette sticks that could be bought was earlier reduced from 200 to 100. It is now proposed to be slashed further.Although a final decision is yet to be taken, the move has triggered massive criticism as flyers shop for their favourite brand of whisky or cigarettes at duty-free shops, which are not just seen to be genuine but also cost less. While data is unavailable, the amount of such imports is not seen to be significant.Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal confirmed the recommendation and said the move was meant to restrict the entry of sin goods and also align Indian rules with global standards. “It’s not a question of large or small (quantities). Even under GST, while alcohol is not included, tobacco is a sin good. As a nation, we are not encouraging the import of alcohol,” he told TOI in an interview, while listing out the permitted quantities in other countries.“All that we have done is highlighted that these are global best practices. I am not sure if India can afford to be so liberal, particularly when it relates to liquor and cigarettes,” the minister added.The recommendation, on which the finance ministry will have a final say, comes at a time when private Indian airport operators had sought a doubling of duty-free liquor allowance from two to four litres to bring airports on par with Thailand , Singapore and Dubai . If Indian passengers purchase duty-free goods outside India, airports back home lose business.“Liquor allowance given in India is not on par with liquor allowance in neighbouring countries/Asia Pacific countries,” the Association of Private Airport Operators (APAO) said in its pre-budget submission. The lobby group argued that more duty-free business would mean more non-aero revenue and help keep aero revenues — charged as airline tariffs and user fees which passengers pay — at reasonable levels.While government officials said the key thrust was on restricting tobacco imports, many frequent flyers argued that the move was uncalled for, especially when India had record foreign exchange reserves and consumers were seeking better quality of life. What has prompted the government to seek a reduction in the overall duty-free import allowance is unclear as travellers usually get small quantities of chocolates, gifts and souvenirs for friends and family members.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73397616,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-264044,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-moves-to-limit-duty-free-to-1-bottle-slash-number-of-cigarettes/articleshow/73397325.cms
18,['20/01/2020'],All Congress states may pass resolutions against CAA,"NEW DELHI: Signalling a step up in the political battle over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and to erase confusion over the comments of senior functionaries that not implementing the law might be ""unconstitutional"", Congress on Sunday said all states where it is in office should follow the example of the party government in Punjab in passing anti-CAA resolution in their respective assemblies.The message was beamed by senior Congress functionary Ahmed Patel , who said, ""After Punjab, we are thinking about bringing a resolution against the CAA in states like Rajasthan, MP and Chhattisgarh. It would be a clear message to the central government to reconsider the Act.""The statement came in the backdrop of comments by senior functionaries Kapil Sibal and Jairam Ramesh , who expressed doubts over the ability of states not to implement the CAA.A day earlier, Kapil Sibal had said, “If the CAA is passed, no state can say ‘I will not implement it’. It is not possible and is unconstitutional. You can oppose it, you can pass a resolution in the assembly and ask the central government to withdraw it. But constitutionally, saying that I won’t implement it is going to be problematic and going to create more difficulties.""On Sunday, as the party clarified matters, Sibal said on Twitter that he believed CAA was ""unconstitutional"" and every state assembly had the constitutional right to pass a resolution and seek its withdrawal. But he did add, “When and if the law is declared to be constitutional by the Supreme Court, then it will be problematic to oppose it... The fight must go on.""In an interaction with a daily, Jairam wondered if the CAA issue might play to BJP’s benefit and said, ""I think one should recognise that there is a space for spontaneous protests by ordinary citizens, students and political parties but on an issue like CAA, there is a dangerous potential for it to be exploited by Modi and Amit Shah — to convert a genuine issue into an issue of communal polarisation.""He also pointed out that he was not sure state governments saying they would not implement CAA would stand judicial scrutiny. “Whether it will stand the test of judicial scrutiny, I am not 100% sure,” he added.Though Congress strongly emphasised its opposition to the CAA and called for resolutions, it stopped short of directing its governments to challenge the Act in the SC, possibly because of uncertainty of the outcome.The party has taken a strong stand against the CAA and the National Population Register (NPR) as well, linking NPR with the National Register of Citizens. While the strategy plays to wooing Muslims and tapping a wider “liberal” sentiment, there is concern over whether it misses a less vocal Hindu consolidation or sympathy for CAA’s political goals.On Sunday, Congress fielded another legal eagle Abhishek Singhvi , who said states challenging the CAA could not be expected to implement a law they have challenged, until the matter was settled by the court. “All that the states have said is they will not implement the law until their challenge of the legislation is settled by the apex court one way or another. It is wrong for BJP to blow this up as a case of non-cooperation or disobedience by the states,” Singhvi said, defending the party’s stand but keeping the tempo down.Commenting on Kerala governor Arif Mohammed Khan summoning the chief secretary over the state government moving the SC against CAA, Singhvi said, “The governor, who occupies a constitutional post, questioning the government is as odd as it would be if the President of India questioned a decision taken by the PM of India and his government. It should be clear who is right or wrong.”So far, the Kerala and Punjab assemblies have passed resolutions against the controversial law, while Kerala has also moved the SC challenging the legislation that seeks to give citizenship to persecuted individuals from three countries on the basis of their religion.Congress’s communications chief Randeep Surjewala called the CAA an “attack” on the Constitution, claiming the people’s movement will continue “courageously and fearlessly”. “PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah have become living symbols of sectarianism, bigotry and fanaticism, using the instrument of state to attack India’s ethos and its Constitution,” he said, invoking the Constitution as India’s biggest ‘dharma’ — of ‘raaj’, ‘neeti’ and ‘karma’.Surjewala’s comments were sharper, reflecting the tenor the party has been adopting and articulated by functionaries like former finance minister P Chidambaram .Earlier this month, Congress had, during a meeting of its working committee, directed Congress-governed states to oppose implementation of NRC and NPR. In a Congress-led meeting of 20 opposition parties, they had also decided, unanimously, to scale up protests against CAA-NRC-NPR across the country.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73398497,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-430455,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/all-congress-states-may-pass-resolutions-against-caa/articleshow/73398249.cms

The “guarantee card” also promises basic infrastructure in all unauthorised colonies and a pukka house for all slum dwellers.“I, as the chief minister assure 10 guarantees to the people of Delhi.

The party is working on a detailed manifesto which will be released in the next 10 days.“People are very much affected by basic services such as electricity, water, education, and healthcare. We guarantee that the existing services and subsidies in these sectors will continue for the next five years.

Along with women, the free bus ride scheme will be extended to include students,” Kejriwal said.The guarantee card listed solutions to reduce air pollution which has become a hot election issue.

23,['20/01/2020'],India tests nuclear-missile from undersea pad,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Representational photo.

NEW DELHI: India tested its nuclear-capable K-4 submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), designed to have a strike range of 3,500 km, from an undersea platform in the shape of a submersible pontoon off the coast of Andhra Pradesh on Sunday.

Though there was no official word on the test of the ‘strategic missile’, which will equip the country’s nuclear-powered submarines, sources said the solid-fuelled K-4 was test-fired for a range of around 2,200 km “successfully” in the Bay of Bengal around noon on Sunday.

“Though K-4 has been tested a few times before, this was the first time it was fired for a long range. The problem of the missile tilting after emerging from under water has been resolved,” said a source.

India’s solitary nuclear-powered submarine with ballistic missiles (SSBN), INS Arihant , is currently armed with K-15 missiles with a strike range of 750 km. The Navy also operates another nuclear-powered submarine, INS Chakra, acquired on a 10-year lease from Russia , but it does not have nuclear-tipped missiles because of international treatises.

INS Arihant had become fully operational in November 2018 after completing its first ‘deterrence patrol’ to complete the country’s long-awaited nuclear triad or the capability to fire nuclear weapons from land, air and sea. India for long has had the land-based Agni missiles, with the over 5,000 km Agni-V inter-continental ballistic missile now in the process of being inducted, and fighter jets jury-rigged to deliver nuclear weapons.

But INS Arihant gives the country’s nuclear deterrence posture much more credibility since SSBNs are the most secure, survivable and potent platforms for retaliatory strikes. Though INS Arihant’s K-15 missiles are currently dwarfed by the well over 5,000 km range SLBMs present with the US, Russia and China, the K-4 missiles will add much more teeth to the follow-on submarines.

The K-4 missiles are to be followed by the K-5 and K-6 missiles in the 5,000 to 6,000 km range. The 6,000-tonne INS Arihant, which is propelled by an 83 MW pressurised light-water reactor at its core is to be followed by INS Arighat, which was launched in 2017. The next generation of nuclear submarines, currently called S-4 and S-4*, will be much larger in size.

24,['20/01/2020'],"Muslims from Pakistan, Afghanistan &amp; Bangladesh too got citizenship: Nirmala Sitharaman","This story is from January 20, 2020

<p>Union minister Nirmala Sitharaman. (PTI)<br></p>

CHENNAI: Pointing out that states cannot refuse to implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act as “that is against law and the Constitution”, Union finance minister said here on Sunday that as many as 2,838 Pakistanis, 914 Afghans and 172 Bangladeshis had been given citizenship in the past six years.

Reeling out statistics issued by the Union home ministry, the finance minister added that 391 Afghans and 1,595 Pakistanis had been given citizenship in the past two years. “Obviously, they include Muslims too,” Sitharaman said, while adding that 566 Muslims from Pakistan , Afghanistan and Bangladesh were given citizenship since 2014.

Participating in a discussion organised by the Chennai Citizens’ Forum and New India Forum, Sitharaman said, ""Political parties can make a political statement by passing resolutions against CAA in the assembly, but states cannot refuse to implement it.""

She said there was an attempt by the opposition to distort the truth and create fear about the CAA. “Every question that the opposition raised in Parliament about the CAA was answered…

The CAA is to offer citizenship and not to deny citizenship to anyone,” Sitharaman said.

The Citizenship Act of 1955 continues to remain in force and citizenship will continue to be given to people if they fulfill the conditions under the four categories — birth, descendency, registration and naturalization. “Just by bringing in changes and amendments does not make the existing categories go away,” she pointed out.

Sitharaman said the people who have been granted citizenship are the ones who had come to India from the then East Pakistan, which later became Bangladesh. “People like them had to be given citizenship and hence the amendment to the Citizenship Act,” she said.

She said the condition was very pitiable in camps where Sri Lankan Tamils live. “Political parties raising the issue for not granting citizenship (to Sri Lankan Tamils) will not talk about these. No human rights organisation will speak about them. Since 1964, more than four lakh Sri Lankans have been granted citizenship. Sri Lankan Tamils living in camps, around 95,000 of them, too will be given citizenship in the coming years,” she said.

Clarifying that the CAA had nothing to do with the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR), Sitharaman said the NRC had been implemented in Assam as per the directions of the Supreme Court. “There have been no talks about the NRC being implemented across India and whether the process will be the same as done in Assam. There have been no talks at all.”

NEW DELHI: India now has a new lethal weapons platform to keep a ‘strategic eye’ over the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), especially the Bay of Bengal, as well as carry out ‘long-range precision strikes’ against hostile aircraft carriers or other high-value targets by day and night in all-weather conditions in the region.The IAF will commission a squadron of Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets, especially modified to carry the 2.5-tonne air-launched supersonic BrahMos cruise missiles, at its Thanjavur airbase in Tamil Nadu on Monday. Primarily tasked with a maritime strike role, these Sukhois will be “a huge addition to IAF’s operational capabilities”, Air Chief Marshal Rakesh Kumar Singh Bhadauria said.BrahMos director-general Sudhir Mishra told TOI, “It’s the realisation of our dream to provide IAF with a formidable and much-desired capability to strike from long standoff distances on any target at sea or on land with pinpoint accuracy.”The new Sukhoi squadron, nicknamed ‘Tiger Sharks’, will be commissioned with four to six fighters at Thanjavur on Monday, and will induct its full complement of 18 fighters by the end of the year. With a combat radius of almost 1,500 km without mid-air refuelling, the Sukhoi will combine with the 290-km range BrahMos missile to constitute a formidable weapons package.Tiger Sharks is the 12th squadron of the fourth-generation ‘air dominance’ Sukhois but the first one to be based in south India after the first 11 were deployed on the western and eastern fronts, from Halwara, Pune, Jodhpur and Sirsa to Bareilly , Tezpur and Chabua, to cater for Pakistan and China.The deployment at Thanjavur is clearly in response to China’s fast-expanding strategic footprint in the IOR, with Beijing now also looking to establish additional logistics facilities in the IOR after setting up its first overseas military base in Djibouti on the Horn of Africa in August 2017, while also using Karachi as a regular naval turnaround facility.Just last month, Navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh had confirmed that Indian warships recently drove away a Chinese oceanic research vessel , Shi Yan-1, after it was found acting suspiciously near the strategically-located Andaman and Nicobar archipelago. There are seven to eight Chinese warships, including submarines, present in the IOR at any given time, he said.The Navy already operates its Poseidon-8I long-range maritime patrol aircraft, which are packed with sensors and weapons to detect, track and destroy enemy submarines, from its INS Rajali base at Arakkonam in Tamil Nadu.Armed with the BrahMos missiles, which fly almost three times the speed of sound at Mach 2.8, the Sukhois will further add to this deterrence over the high seas right up to the Malacca Strait. “The capability of the missile, coupled with the high performance of the Sukhois, will give IAF strategic reach and allow it to dominate over land and sea. The Sukhoi-BrahMos package can also be used in surgical strikes to destroy terror camps across the Line of Control with Pakistan,” said an official.With IAF having inducted 260 of the 272 twin-seat Sukhois contracted from Russia for around $15 billion, 42 of the fighters are to be eventually armed with BrahMos missiles. With India joining the 34-nation Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) in June 2016, which “removed the caps” on the range of the missile developed jointly with Russia, plans are also afoot to develop an extended range BrahMos with a 450-500 km range. The MTCR basically prevents the proliferation of missiles and drones over the range of 300 km.The IAF also plans to upgrade its entire Sukhoi fleet with more advanced avionics, radars and weapons to further bolster their combat capabilities. Detailed talks are currently underway with Russia and HAL for the mega project, as was earlier reported by TOI.In Video: South India gets Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets squadron as ‘strategic eye’",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73400706,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-144935,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/eye-on-china-south-gets-1st-sukhoi-squad-with-brahmos/articleshow/73400569.cms

Villagers form a human chain on boats in Bochaha block in Muzaffarpur district on Sunday

PATNA: Over 5.16 crore people participated in the 18,034-km long human chain in the state to create awareness about conservation of water and increasing green cover, prohibition and the adverse impact of social evils like dowry and child marriage, said chief secretary Deepak Kumar.

The human chain, the third of its kind in the state, was formed by the state government under its ‘Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali’ campaign. A little over 57.76 lakh schoolchildren from Class I to IV also took part in the human chain but on their respective campuses. Besides, 43,445 prisoners also formed human chain inside the jail premises, he said.

Chief minister Nitish Kumar , who joined the human chain along with deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi , assembly speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary and ‘Water Man’ Rajendra Singh at Gandhi Maidan, thanked people for their record participation. Though the human chain was officially formed from 11.30am to 12pm across the state, people had lined up on the streets much before the event started.

Seven choppers and over 100 drones were used to cover the event. The representatives of Limca Book of Records and Indian Book of Records were present to assess the length of human chain, which was claimed to be the longest so far across the globe. Anjani Kumar Singh, the adviser to CM, said the representatives of Guinness World Records were also invited but they expressed their inability to come due to some technical reasons.

The chief secretary said two human chains were earlier formed in 2017 and 2018. Over 3.5 crore people had participated in 11,292km-long human chain in 2017 while the 2018 human chain was over 14,000km long. “The 2020 human chain has exceeded both the previous events both in length and participation,” he told the media.

Two people, including a government school teacher, died due to cardiac arrest while taking part in the event in Darbhanga and Samastipur districts. While Md Dawood was a teacher at Urdu Middle School, Dighiyar under Keoti block in Darbhanga district, one Reshma belonged to Jitwarpur in Samastipur district. The chief secretary said ex gratia of Rs 4 lakh will be paid to the next of kin of each of the deceased. In the case of the school teacher, his family would also be provided post-retiral benefits. He said both the persons died due to suspected cardiac arrest.

Beaming over the grand success of the event, Nitish said, “This human chain is unique in its kind and a part of ‘Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali’ programme. We will continue to work in mission mode and achieve the target. People barring age and religion have participated in this human chain in large numbers, which shows they have become conscious about the issue.

“This is for the society. If I do some mistake, criticize me as much as you want. But for ‘Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali, everyone should come together and support it.”

Rajendra Singh presented a kalash filled with water to Nitish on behalf of his organization Tarun Bharat Sangh. Nitish said people of Bihar deserved the appreciation and not him.

Atul Bagai of United Nations Environment Programme lauded the efforts being taken in Bihar regarding protection of environment.

27,['20/01/2020'],How Tolly celebrities help their kids beat exam blues,"The party season is over, and everyone is back to the grind. February and March are the months when children have their boards or annual examinations. So, the stress levels, both for children and their parents, are obviously high. The children are already anxious about their performance, so parents are providing mental support to make them feel confident. CT spoke to a few Tollywood celeb parents to know how they help their children deal with examination stress. Read on...My son, Ankan Rishav Chakraborty , is in Class XI and there is some examination stress at the moment. As a mother, I try to make him understand that it is his responsibility to study well. I want him to have a great future. I am not interfering at all. Parents should be supportive instead. I try to be with him as much as possible before his exams. I insist he listens to music or meet his friends to unwind. The best thing is to make your children feel responsible for their actions. Too much of monitoring and guidance do not help. Rather, it is important that they know what to do and when. As for my daughter, Rishona, I would never want her to be stressed. She is in Class II now. I guide her as much as possible.My daughter, Hiya, who is in Class XII and will appear for her boards next month, gets paranoid before her exams. I keep telling her not to take stress, as that does no good in the long run. My wife is a teacher. She helps Hiya make a study timetable so that there is enough time to revise every subject. She also assists her in revising. I always try to make the situation light by providing assurance and emotional support. The other thing I monitor is whether she is getting enough sleep, as that is very important. Both my wife and I try to make Hiya understand that appearing in exams and getting good marks are just a part of life and not life itself!My wife and I don’t add on to Brishtisnata’s examination stress. We are comparatively cooler than other parents as our anxiety will only increase her stress. Since childhood, we have tried to make her a responsible child, be it in her studies or other things. In fact, I remember, taking her out for dinner when she didn’t score well just to prove that marks are not the end of the world. We give more importance to becoming a sensible and compassionate human being than being scoring high marks in exams. Brishtisnata has a habit of studying late at night, so we make sure she gets eight-nine hours of sleep. She watches films before exams to unwind and we have no issues about that. We always try to identify her strengths and interests. Accordingly, we try to build her self-esteem. The most important thing is to have a healthy conversation with her, so she feels confident and happy!Abhimanyu (Chatterjee) is in Class X now and has his board examination in February. I try to reduce the stress as much as possible. I’ve always taught him to put in 100 per cent effort. If this does not bring positive results, he should accept failure and move on. Secondly, I encourage him to take breaks in between his studies and do whatever he feels like, except fiddling with the phone! Thirdly, I advise him to not ask his friends how many times they have revised as each student has his or her own way of preparing. I only coordinate with his class teacher if I have any doubt regarding his studies and never with any parent, as it doubles my stress. I make sure Abhimanyu meditatates and does yoga before exams. Proper sleep and right diet too are necessary to remain stress-freePraneel (Basu) will be in Class VIII this year and his annual exam is knocking on the door. But he is a bindaas kid, who doesn’t take much stress about studies. He wants to be a cricketer. At times, I get paranoid because of his casual attitude. But gone are the days when parents used to scold their kids if they didn’t study. Now, I make Praneel realise that basic education is required to be a cricketer too. I always tell him that to maintain this lifestyle, courtesy his mother, he needs to earn. I am not the type of person who will call up his friends’ mothers to discuss or compare. At times, I do nag him to study, but not to a great extent. Every child is different and so are their study habits. But I do give him tests at home and take him out to eat if he does well. That’s how I encourage him. I believe in destiny, so whatever is destined for my son will happen. But, he should put in his best effort.Prachyadeep, is in Class XI. Since childhood, we have inculcated in him that studies are not only about scoring high marks in examinations. Rather, it is more about enriching one’s self. So, the fear of not scoring high marks is not there in my house. Sunday is a holiday for my son. The stress of running from one coaching centre to another is something he is devoid of. That apart, I tell him to keep the study table clear as too many books make you feel stressed. My wife is part of the WhatsApp group of my son’s school, but she only passes on the messages to him that are necessary from him to know. That keeps the stress at bay. Another thing we consciously do is never show our tension in front of him before examination as that only makes things worse.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73378188,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-244570/73378188.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/bengali/movies/news/how-tolly-celebrities-help-their-kids-beat-exam-blues/articleshow/73378084.cms

ALAPPUZHA: The over 100-year-old Cheravally Jamaat Masjid in Kayamkulam on Sunday hosted a Hindu wedding on its premises, complete with a vegetarian feast – including two payasam -- for 4,000 people. People cutting across religions attended the event while the jamaat committee met all its expenses.

Sarath Sasi of Kappil Kizhakku, Kayamkulam and Anju Ashok Kumar tied the knot on the mosque premises, with a Hindu priest leading the rituals. The couple later entered the mosque and sought the blessings of chief imam Riyasudeen Faizy.

Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the wedding was as an example of unity from Kerala . “Congratulations to the newlyweds, families, mosque authorities and people of Cheravally,” he said in a tweet.

“The committee also gave Anju 10 sovereign gold and Rs 2 lakh as wedding gift besides home equipment like TV and fridge,” said Nujumudeen Alummoottil, secretary of Cheravally Muslim Jamaat Committee. He said he knew Anju’s father personally, and wanted to help the family after the father passed away.

Nujumudeen said Anju is also the first woman to enter the mosque. “All religions teach people to love and care for others. Those lessons led to this wedding,” he said.

He had received an application from Bindu, wife of late Ashok Kumar, seeking help to conduct the wedding of her 24-year-old daughter Anju in October last year. “When I shared the application with committee members, all of them came forward to arrange facilities for the wedding. Bindu is staying in a rented house with her three children. We decided to conduct the wedding as per Hindu rituals on the mosque premises,” he said.

“I have a jewellery shop in Kayamkulam and I knew Anju’s father Ashokan, who was a goldsmith. He died of cardiac arrest at the age of 49 on March 14, 2018 after dropping his son Anand at Kayamkulam Boys High School for his SSLC examination and his son wrote the exam without knowing about Ashokan’s demise. I had visited the family then after reading about it in the newspaper. I had also extended some help then,” he said.

Both Anju and her sister Amritha had stopped their studies after completing Plus-Two due to financial constraints. Anand is pursuing higher secondary education now.

On Sunday, Bindu was lost for words to express her gratitude to the committee. She and her husband had sold their house and land in Kayamkulam around 17 years ago owing to financial constraints and they were living in rented houses since then. The unexpected demise of Ashokan came as a shock. “I have joined a private firm as cleaner for a salary of Rs 7,000. The rent of our present house near Cheravally temple is Rs 2,500 and we are somehow meeting our monthly expenses. I did not have any other means to conduct the wedding that I sought Nujumudin’s help,” she said.

29,['20/01/2020'],Nadda likely to take over as BJP president today,"This story is from January 20, 2020

NEW DELHI: BJP working president J P Nadda is set to take over as party chief replacing Amit Shah on Monday in the presence of top party functionaries.

Senior functionaries including Union ministers and those from states are likely to arrive at the BJP headquarters to file nominations in support of Nadda, whose ascension to the top post was awaited since Shah became home minister last year.

Nadda's decades-long experience in the organisation, starting from student politics, proximity to the RSS and clean image are seen as his strengths. His tenure as in-charge of the party headquarters will also come handy in running the party since he is known to workers directly.

Senior BJP leader Radha Mohan Singh, who is in-charge of the party's organisational poll process, said nominations for the national president's election will be filed on January 20, and a contest will take place the next day if required.

BJP has the convention of electing its president with consensus and without any contest, and there is little possibility that it will be any other way this time. The election of a new president will end Shah's tenure of over five-and-a-half years during which BJP expanded its footprints across the country .

30,['20/01/2020'],Flight takes 12 hours to make 45-minutes trip to Bagdogra,"Passengers of flight SG 3321 wait at the lounge on Sunday

KOLKATA: Passengers booked on a morning SpiceJet flight to north Bengal on Sunday had a harrowing time after the 45-minute journey from Kolkata to Bagdogra ended up taking more than 12 hours — at least an hour more than what it takes for a train, like Darjeeling Mail, to reach New Jalpaiguri from Sealdah under normal circumstances. During the period, flyers had to sit in the aircraft for over two hours, waiting for it to take off, before being asked to wait at the security hold area of Kolkata airport for several hours. The reason cited by the airline for the delay was low visibility at Bagdogra airport and inadequate operating crew.The flight — SG 3321 — was slated to take off at 6.05am on Sunday and land at 6.50am. It finally reached the destination around 7pm on Sunday.Most of the 78 passengers booked on the flight had reported to the airport by 4am since the boarding time was scheduled at 5.45am.However, the boarding kept getting delayed and the flyers were finally allowed to board around 6.30am.It then took off from Kolkata. However, halfway into the journey, the flight turned back as crew members announced that the aircraft was unable to land due to poor visibility at Bagdogra. It landed in Kolkata at 7.15am. “We were told the flight will resume its journey once the situation got better and we were seated inside as it stood on the tarmac for two hours, till 9.30am. Then an announcement was made that the flight had been delayed and the aircraft was taken to a parking bay and we were asked to get off,” said Sharmishtha Mondal, one of the passengers.Once they had alighted, passengers were sent text messages about the flight being delayed further. “First, we were told the flight will take off at 11.45am. Then we received another message, informing us that the revised timing was 3.20pm and lastly, there was a message that said the flight would take off at 5.20pm. All the while, the reason they cited was bad weather in Bagdogra. However, we personally checked from people staying in Bagdogra and north Bengal that the weather had improved from 9.30am itself. In fact, a Vistara flight had landed at Bagdogra at 9.37am on Sunday,” Mondal added. A resident of Baruipur, Mondal had started from her home at 1am and had been waiting at the airport since 3am.The flight finally took off at 5.45pm and reached Bagdogra around 6.45pm, by when it had already turned dark and the flyers who had expected an early start to their vacations rued the loss of an entire day.“We had planned to reach Bagdogra early and had a car waiting outside the airport to take us to our hotel in Darjeeling. We had planned a day trip around the hills on Sunday itself, but the flight delay ruined all our plans. I overheard the crew members saying that the pilot who was flying the aircraft in the morning was no longer available and they had to send for a pilot from Jabalpur,” said Mondal’s husband Subhasis Baidya, a sales manager with a car showroom in the city.SpiceJet, in an official statement, blamed the delay on bad weather and inadequate operating crew. The airline referred Flight Duty Time (FDT) Limitations — a stipulation laid down by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation — that prescribes every flying crew member, both in the cockpit and the cabin, to take mandatory off duty after their official schedule, irrespective of whether they fly.“The flight had to return to Kolkata due to bad weather in Bagdogra. As the visibility increased, the operating crew crossed their FDT Limitations for the day. A fresh crew was required to operate the flight. The flight operated at 5.20pm. SpiceJet apologises for the inconvenience caused due to the delay,” said a SpiceJet spokesperson.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73405936,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-563430,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/flight-takes-12-hrs-to-make-45-min-trip-to-bagdogra/articleshow/73397062.cms

Almost the entire first floor has been gutted

The stretcher used to bring down an ailing woman from the second floor of the building and the ambulance sent by the local police station

KOLKATA: A fire at a building in a building at the Kankurgachhi intersection on Sunday morning left residents — mostly senior citizens — panicked and a paralysed woman panting for breath till she was rescued by neighbours. The fire that broke out inside a beauty and wellness centre revived memories of a more devastating one at the same spot 13 months ago.Vinod Bansal, president of the seven-storey Kashi Niket, was in his fourth-floor apartment when he noticed the fire. “Around 8.15am, there was a stench of burning. We had had a horrific time just 13 months ago when a fire inside a commercial area on the first floor leapt till the fifth floor and burnt a portion of our house. That fear forced me to run downstairs to investigate. I found thick smoke billowing from the beauty and wellness centre on the first floor,” Bansal recounted.Security guards had, by that time, alerted the fire brigade and fire tenders soon reached the spot. “The challenge was to evacuate the elderly persons. It being a Sunday morning, many of them were still asleep and we didn’t know who was aware and who wasn’t. Even my kids were asleep,” Bansal added.The biggest concern for the residents was a paralysed woman with her residence just above the seat of fire. “Her husband passed away and her children stay overseas. We decided to bring her down on a foldable, canvas stretcher. We had called up the police station, too, and they sent an ambulance. She was brought down and shifted into the ambulance, but she was feeling breathless by then,” recounted Pinaki Narayan Ganguly, another resident.Ganguly’s parents-in-law stay in the same building and they needed to be shifted out as well.“My mother-in-law is 77 years old and my father-in-law turned 85 some months ago. Me and my son took them up to the terrace. Being a COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) patient myself, I was finding it difficult to breathe. But there was no way I could go out,” Ganguly said. His son Rahul, whose wedding is on Wednesday, kept rushing them out and helped with the general evacuation.While the beauty and wellness centre is closed on Sundays, residents called up two of their staffers, who then rushed to the spot. Firefighters broke the large glass panes to allow the smoke to escape. For the next two hours, five fire tenders kept battling the blaze, which gutted almost the entire commercial space on the first floor.“Primarily, it seemed that the fire originated from a short circuit. We are waiting for the fire brigade to find out what exactly happened. The building does have fire-safety arrangements, like sprinklers, so we need to know how the flames spread inside the commercial space despite that,” Bansal said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73413541,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-847675,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/early-morning-fire-guts-wellness-centre-in-kankurgachhi-building/articleshow/73397177.cms

GAYA: The much-delayed Magadh University Students’ Union elections will be held on March 6.

As per the election schedule released by the university, the election process will begin on February 24, the date on which the draft electoral roll is to be published. The draft will be published separately for all 19 constituent colleges and the headquarters-based postgraduate departments.

Objections would be invited against any anomaly in the draft electoral roll on February 25. The same evening, the final electoral roll will be published after disposing off the objections. Nomination papers will be accepted on February 27 between 10 am and 3.00 pm. Scrutiny will be done the same day after the expiry of the nomination period.

Candidates can withdraw their nominations on February 28. Voting and counting of votes will be held on March 6. Voting will end at 3pm and the counting will begin half-an-hour after the polling process ends.

The election schedule has been made only for college and department-level office bearers. Neither the schedule, nor the methodology (direct or indirect) has been released for the election of the central-level (the entire university in which all registered students and research scholars participate) union election.

Asked about the election of the central union comprising all colleges and PG departments, registrar Sidnath Prasad Deen said, “It is for the committee constituted to decide the modalities of election to take a call in the matter.”

A sizeable number of students believe that with nine months of the academic year 2019-20 gone, the union elections have become virtually meaningless and it was no more than a ritual. In any case, only unit level elections are being held. Instead of holding election for only two months, the university must notify a permanent election calendar whereby elections are to be held immediately after the last date of admission, feel majority of the students.

Representative image

PATNA: Several government buildings in the city, including divisional commissioner’s office, have cut down energy bill by 70-80% after installation of solar panels last month.

“Solar panels have not just cut down the power bill, but have also set an example to store and consume renewable sources of energy,” said Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal.

He added, “The solar panel atop divisional commissioner’s office is capable of producing 45 kilowatt of electricity. Even though there weren’t many sunny days after the installation of solar panel in mid-December, there has been a major reduction as far as energy bill is concerned. This month’s electricity consumption at the office was 950 units, of which 800 units were covered by solar panels.”

Talking about energy consumption during summer, he said, “Solar panels are sufficient even when the weather is hot and electricity consumption is more due to the use of air conditioners and fans. In fact, we are expecting a 100% reduction in electricity bills in the coming months. Since summer days are sunny, the panel will store more solar energy.”

Aimed at promoting renewable source, altogether 23 government buildings across the city were identified for installation of solar panels. As part of Patna Smart City Limited (PSCL), 10 solar rooftop panels have so far been set up in the city – one each at DM’s residence, divisional commissioner’s office, Indira Gandhi Planetarium, Bihar Rajya Police Parivahan Mukhyalay and Sachchidanand Sinha Library and four at Bankipore Girls’ High School.

PSCL sources said Bihar Renewable Energy Development Agency (BREDA) has already conducted surveys of the remaining locations. “The project, which entails an expenditure of Rs2.45 crore, is targeted to be completed in two-three months,” a PSCL official said.

Altogether 181kW solar panels have started generating electricity at DM’s residence, divisional commissioner’s office and Bankipur Girls’ High School. “While solar rooftop panels on the four buildings of Bankipore Girls’ High School have capacity of 125kW, panels at the divisional commissioner’s office and DM’s office can produce 45kW and 11kW of electricity, respectively,” the official added.

37,['20/01/2020'],US pharma companies get more FDA ‘warnings’ than Indian firms,"(Representative image)

MUMBAI: The Indian pharma industry, which is rapped for poor manufacturing practices globally, seems to be cleaning up its act, at least in relative terms. American drug firms were issued 54 warning letters by the USFDA, while India — which had the distinction of getting most warning letters — stood second with 17 such notices in the year ended September (US financial year). China ranked third with 14 warning letters (see graphic).A company slapped with a warning letter is barred from introducing new products in the US, hindering its ability to increase sales in the world’s top pharmaceutical market. Earlier, emerging economies like either India or China topped the list. In the previous year, the US received 19 warning letters, while China got most at 21, and India had 15.Data integrity issues, which include inappropriate manufacturing practices and overlooking results while testing medicines, continue to dog the drug industry with 32 of 98 warning letters in FY19 citing the issue. In the previous year, 34 of 94 warning letters were due to data integrity lapses, which have a significant impact on drug product quality.Several domestic pharma companies have been hauled up by the US regulator over issues like lax documentation, overlooking test results and unhygienic manufacturing facilities with open toilet drains. Indian companies command around 35% volume share in the highly lucrative US generic market, valued at nearly $70 billion.“Common issues for manufacturing establishments around the world (including the US, India and China) include inadequate or poor quality systems implementation, data integrity issues, inadequate validation of various processes used in manufacturing or testing, and product contamination. In any region, some drug manufacturers meet US requirements, while others do not. When we determine that there are significant violations at a manufacturing establishment, we take appropriate action to protect the public health,” a USFDA official told TOI.The official added, “It is important to note that the number of annual inspections in any region or country may fluctuate year-to-year because some inspections occur on a routine basis, while others take place when the FDA is reviewing specific product marketing applications, or when the agency receives information about potential product manufacturing or quality problems.”In 2019, major companies — including Lupin , Torrent, Aurobindo , Strides Pharma, Cadila Healthcare, Indoco Remedies, Glenmark , Jubilant Life Sciences and Emcure Pharma — were issued warning letters for significant violations of current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations. Typically, the action follows inspections and audits carried out by the US regulator.PwC India leader (pharmaceutical & life sciences) Sujay Shetty said, “Data shows the phenomena of warning letters spread across many countries, and not just unique to India. Indian companies hog the limelight, though they may have got lower number of letters (in other years). Also, the data speaks volumes about domestic companies investing effort and resources in upgrading quality systems in their facilities.”Commenting on USFDA audits, Sun Pharma managing director Dilip Shanghvi had said in a recent investor call, “Indian companies file large number of products, and as a part of their assurance to the US Congress, the USFDA has said that they will try and conduct as many pre-approval inspections as necessary. If we continue to be the largest filer of new ANDAs in the world, we will have a large number of inspections. As regulators see any kind of a risk in one inspection, they add as part of the inspection plan for future audits. Accordingly, the focus of USFDA inspections will continuously change, and it will help improve the quality of products for safety of patients.”",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73423453,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-52814,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/us-pharma-cos-get-more-fda-warnings-than-indian-firms/articleshow/73397856.cms

GAYA: Bihar Electricity Regulatory Commission ( BERC ) chairman SK Negi on Saturday exhorted officials of the South Bihar Power Distribution Company Limited (SBPDCL) to prevent leakages and avoid unnecessary burden on consumers.

The BERC chairman was interacting with stakeholders on the issue of tariff-hike proposed by the distribution company. Negi directed the power distribution company to open more counters and introduce innovative tariff collection mechanism. “Number of bill collection counters was insufficient,” the chairman said.

Tariff, according to DK Jain, former president of the Central Bihar Chamber of Commerce (CBCC) was already very high. “The distribution companies (discoms) cannot be allowed to penalise the genuine users for its own inefficiency and management deficit,” said Jain.

During the interaction, Vidyut Upbhokta Sangharsh Samiti opposed the move to put extra burden on power users on the basis of imaginary loss. A three-page representation submitted by the Sangharsh Samiti to the BERC chairman stated that the number of power consumers has gone up and as such the company was enjoying economy of scale.

Referring to the claims of discoms that distribution loss has come down, the Sangharsh Samiti alleged that demand for tariff hike contradicted their own claims. Instead of demanding direct hike in energy charges, the company has sought hike in fixed charges, thereby resorting to psychological one-upmanship.

The representation said that power tariff was much less in Delhi and some other states as compared to south Bihar and as such a downward revision was required. Delhi model must be implemented in Bihar. Proposed hike in meter rent has also been opposed by the Gaya power users.

Power distribution in Gaya, it may be recalled was outsourced to India Power, a private company, which was, in 2014 awarded franchise for 15 years. The franchise was cancelled four years later in 2018.

PATNA: Braving chilling cold and inclement weather, thousands of people joined hands in Patna district on Sunday to give a message on the need to protect environment and fight against the social evils of dowry and child marriage . According to chief secretary Deepak Kumar, the maximum 27.87 lakh people joined human chain in Patna among the 38 districts in the state.

People from all age groups and sections of the society got up early in the morning and headed to the streets as early as 9am despite overcast sky and cold. Schoolchildren were seen playing drums at the entrance of chief minister’s 1, Aney Marg residence, while others were seen walking on the streets in groups with placards and slogans to raise awareness on environment conservation. As scheduled, people reached their designated spots across the district to be a part of the human chain formed across the state.

Vehicles mainly kept off the roads as the district administration had restricted vehicular traffic on several routes from 9.30am to 1pm. Those who preferred to stay indoors remained glued to TV screens at homes for getting updates on the human chain formation, the biggest for a social cause across the world, as claimed by the state government.

Rikki Renum, a second semester BBA student, praised the government’s step. “Water is wasted a lot in our society. It’s important to save it in order to save the country’s future,” she said. The student with a poster giving message to save water had formed a small human chain of her colleagues near Ashiana Mor.

Few motorists, however, complained of facing inconvenience due to traffic restrictions even though district administration and city police had made prior announcement about it.

Arun Kumar, who was going to Khagaul on a bike from Boring Road, said the government must take steps to address other major problems like unemployment. “There is no question that the human chain formation is a great initiative by the state government to make people aware about nature before time runs out, but there are some other important issues which must be addressed by the government,” he said.

While Arun lamented hassles in vehicular movement, several senior citizens lauded the district administration for better arrangements on the roads from safety point of view, due to which they joined the human chain in Khagaul and Danapur. While a long human chain was made all along the 5km-long Khagaul-Danapur road, another chain was formed right from Danapur railway station to Bihta through Neora and Sadisopur along the railway lines.

40,['20/01/2020'],6 opposition legislators join human chain,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Human chain along with thousands of supporters

PATNA: Six legislators of opposition Grand Alliance participated in the Nitish government-sponsored human chain , triggering speculations about their possible change of loyalty before the state assembly election due in October-November.

Five of them are MLAs while the sixth is RJD MLC Sanjay Prasad, who was elected from Munger local bodies constituency. Prasad’s six-year term is to expire in July 2021. The five MLAs who participated in the human chain are RJD’s Maheshwar Prasad Yadav from Gaighat, Faraz Fatmi from Keoti, Prema Chaurasia from Patepur, Congress’s Purnima Yadav from Gobindpur in Nawada and Sanjay Kumar Tiwari alias Munna Tiwari from Buxar.

They participated in the human chain along with hundreds of their supporters. While Purnima joined the human chain along with her husband and JD(U) MLA Kaushal Yadav on the Patna-Ranchi national highway at Budhaul in Nawada, Sanjay Prasad took part in the event at Chakai in Jamui district.

Prema told TOI that she along with her supporters joined the human chain near Paswan Chowk at Hajipur while Sanjay Tiwari said he joined the chain at Jyoti Chowk in Buxar town. “I joined the human chain along with thousands of supporters at Gaighat,” Maheshwar told TOI over phone.

Similarly, Faraz joined the human chain at Karpoori Chowk near DMCH in Darbhanga town along with his father and former Union minister MAA Fatmi. Senior Fatmi is now a JD(U) leader.

Reacting over it, RJD spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said, “The party has taken note of such MLAs, who took part in the human chain despite top RJD leaders like Lalu Prasad, Rabri Devi and Tejashwi Prasad Yadav regularly criticizing the event as misuse of public money.”

To a question, Prema said it was for a noble cause. “If I am in opposition, it does not mean that I should oppose even good works of the government. Moreover, the RJD had not issued any specific instructions to the MLAs not to join the state government-sponsored programme,” she said.

Tiwari also said Congress had not issued any instruction on the issue. “I joined the human chain after several intellectuals of my town approached me for the same. Being an MLA, how can I ignore the request of local people and that, too, for a good cause?” Tiwari said.

Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad

MEERUT: “It is clear that the intention of the government - in the backdrop of the deaths that occurred in the violence of December 20 in the entire country - was wrong. The National Register for Citizens (NRC) and Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) are black law of the country. This law will hamper the unity and secularism of the country. The government should immediately withdraw the law,” said Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad .

Azad was in Meerut to meet the families of the deceased in the December 20 violence in the district. Please refused him to meet the families of the deceased and there and hence we had to meet them at another place in the district. He met the family at city is Hira Garden her.

“What happened in Meerut on December 20 was extremely horrific. According to what the families have told me here, it is clear that Hitler rule is on in the district. Most of those killed in the December 20 violence had got police gunshots. We have approach the high court in the matter for relief and the case will be heard on December 23. An investigation should be set up against the accused police personnel,” said Azad.

Azad further said that we live in a democracy and in a democracy everybody has a right to say what they believe in. “Nobody can be shot in the head in the name of democracy. The situation of UP was not such even at the time of Babri demolition and at the time when section 370 was scrapped,” said Azad.

Azad further tweeted from his account that he was not allowed to go to Meerut and hence he had to meet the families of the deceased outside only. Meanwhile, the legal team of Bhim Army will support the deceased, he said in his tweet.

Allahabad: A group of protesters with bandages on their forehead, bleeding nose and fractured hands, while holding placards against CAA and NRC in their hands, led to some anxious moments and confusion during the ongoing agitation against citizenship law at Mansoor Ali park in Roshan Bagh area on Sunday.

While the crowd at protest site initially believed that the protesters were really injured, the organisers later clarified they were enacting alleged police atrocities at Jamia Millia Islamia, Aligarh Muslim University and in Assam.

The group of youths was the centre of attraction since Sunday morning.

As they stood in front of the crowd, people addressing protestors kept pointing at them while narrating alleged police atrocities in Assam, AMU and Jamia Millia Islamia giving impression that they had been subjected to violence. Many people recorded videos, clicked pictures and shared it on social media.

However, later in the day, organisers announced that they were only enacting the Jamia and AMU incidents and none of them was really injured.

As the news spread, police received information about the development.

Cops told organisers that the enactment could create confusion and disturb peaceful atmosphere of the city.

Later, organisers asked the youths to remove their bandages. It was then that common protestors realised that they were not really injured.

“I was surprised to see that this was only an enactment and they were not injured for real”, said a volunteer at the dharna site.

General secretary of Congress (Allahabad unit) Irshad Ulla said, “This is a democracy and everyone is free to choose the way he or she wants to protest. The protesters wanted to inform people what happened at other places. It was their style of communicating.”

Meanwhile, women protestors from nearby localities took out a procession and reached the park. Holding placards against CAA and NRC, they shouted anti-government slogans.

SSP, Allahabad, Satyarth Aniruddha Pankaj said, “Peaceful protests are acceptable but organisers should not instigate people and test the patience of disciplined police force. Action will be taken if law and order is disturbed.”

51,['20/01/2020'],‘Border fencing a hurdle for wild ass’,"This story is from January 20, 2020

The report said that wild asses would move across the international border in the past

AHMEDABAD: The International Union For Conservation of Nature has red-flagged the India-Pakistan border fencing, as a threat to the Asiatic wild ass population in the state. The ICUN report states that the fencing is preventing the wild ass from crossing over, which is part of its normal behaviour.

The IUCN Red List report, on the Asiatic wild ass, noted that “the International Boundary with Pakistan has been fenced thus restricting the possibility of wild ass movement beyond borders.”

The report said that wild asses would move across the international border in the past, adding that the wild ass population that was thriving in Pakistan in the late 1990’s, is now under a cloud as there have been no recent reports of its presence in Pakistan.

A senior officer said that in early the 2000’s there were reports of wild ass crossing to Pakistan from Gujarat and vice versa and the border in Banaskantha was a corridor.

In reply to a question by Anand MP Devusinh Chauhan, Union minister of state for home Kiren Rijiju stated that 60km of the fencing on the Gujarat-Pakistan border was incomplete and Gujarat and Pakistan share a 508km border, of which fencing is possible only on 340km.

Rijiju had said that the remaining 60km of fencing would be complete by March 2020.

Among other threats the wild ass faces in the Little Rann of Kutch, stem from increasing human activities. Land use patterns have changed since the Narmada Dam Project which resulted in the Sardar Sarovar canals all around the protected area. Uninformed release of Sardar Sarovar canal excess waters into the Rann is affecting the micro-habitat, the short grasslands, and is restricting the movement of wild ass and other species across the saline desert.

The IUCN also reported that the great India bustard also crosses over to Pakistan from Gujarat and Rajasthan, and raised alarm about their poaching in Pakistan, saying that it could lead to the extinction of the species in western India.

The Red List report for 2017 states, “Current levels of hunting may result in the extinction of even the largest western Indian population in the next 15-20 years.”

Nagpur: The death of E4, around 3-year-old radio-collared tigress in Chatgaon under Gadchiroli division, has refreshed memories of Jai , a dominant tiger which went missing from Umred-Paoni-Karhandla wildlife sanctuary due to lack of monitoring in April 2016.

This is the sixth radio-collared tiger which has died in Eastern Vidarbha Landscape (EVL) and third in Gadchiroli in the last three years. These tigers were collared by Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, under the EVL project.

E4’s death has stirred up a debate on social media by wildlife activists and lovers who blamed WII and forest department for lack of monitoring.

The decomposed carcass of E4 was found in Chatgaon range under Gadchiroli forest division on Saturday. E4, which was radio-collared on March 1, 2019, was among the three sub-adult cubs of T49 tigress from Ekara Bhuj in Bramhapuri .

According to veterinarians doing the post-mortem, the carcass seemed to be over 20 days old. This indicates no monitoring was done for E4. Gadchiroli officials admit that they didn’t know about presence of tigress in their area.

Bramhapuri officials it seems did not coordinate with Gadchiroli officials.

“We have issued show cause to round officer and forest guard for negligence. The collar has been sent to WII,” said Gadchiroli deputy conservator SR Kumaraswamy.

Forest department uses data from radio-collars to know the dispersal routes, tiger behaviour, predation, population and ecology. According to WII scientist Bilal Habib, last GPS location of E4 was received on July 17, 2019, from Mendki. After that E4 was actively ground monitored through very high frequency (VHF) antenna. The last VHF was observed on September 27, 2019, at 4.15pm in FDCM area of Bramhapuri.

“We lost track of E4 after September 27. WII team tried to track the tigress every 15 days at strategic locations in Wadsa and Gadchiroli but to no avail. The distance between E4’s last location and the spot where carcass was found is 42km. More details will be available after retrieving data from the collar,” said Habib.

“Repeated appeals have bee made to streamline patrolling and wildlife monitoring system but it appears wildlife management has its own agenda. If radio-collared tigers can’t be monitored then the future is bleak,” said RR Sahay, former APCCF.

According to animal ecologist Abi T Vanak, just because it was collared doesn’t mean tigers won’t die. “We need to concentrate on keeping breeding populations safe. Collars also allow us to determine that tigers have died,” he said.

For wildlife conservationist Udayan Patil, death of E4 means loss of at least 15 tigers since it was a young breeding tigress. “It is not about an individual dying. It’s all about negligence. Doubts on collaring have been raised as such episodes have happened many times. Take for example Jai, Srinivas and other three released tigers after fitting collars. The data of Jai’s collar has still not been made public, not even under RTI,” he said.

“If a collared tiger is not tracked for so long, it means lack of monitoring and carelessness. There is no need to waste money on collars in absence of proper protection and tracking plan,” said conservationist Prafulla Bhamburkar.

Sarosh Lodhi of Conservation Lenses & Wildlife (CLaW) is of the view that when WII and forest department take credit for a radio-collared tiger travelling 1,700km, they should also accept the failures of such tigers dying due to “sheer negligence”.

According to honorary wildlife warden Vivek Karambelkar, two months ago a cattle kill was reported from the area where the carcass was found. “Neither camera traps were installed nor the area was scanned. There is dire need of capacity building of foresters in Gadchiroli,” he said.

Tiger poacher flees from custody

Yashwant Bobhate, 50, one of the main accused in poaching of a tiger on January 11 in Mudjha village in South Bramhapuri, escaped from forest custody on Friday. The news was kept under wraps by forest officials. Bobhate was under FCR till January 20. The accused jumped custody when he was taken for a medical examination. Deputy conservator Kulraj Singh said, “Police and forest teams have launched search operation for the accused.”

Kannada writer SL Bhyrappa (left) and veteran actor Mohan Aghashe

PUNE: Kannada writer SL Bhyrappa on Sunday said Pune was the cultural capital of Maharashtra and people of the city should indulge in exchange of literature.

A renowned literary critic and theatre personality, Bhyrappa was in the city to attend a ceremony organized by the Karnataka government, in association with the Kannada Sangha, Pune, to felicitate him at the Shakuntala J Shetty auditorium at Erandwane.

Addressing the audience, the Padma Shri awardee writer said, “Pune is the cultural capital of Maharashtra. One should learn the best from the Maharashtrian community and give them the best of Kannada. This would help in translation of more Marathi work to Kannada, and vice versa.”

He said, “My work has been translated to many languages, but the kind of love I’ve got from Maharashtra is unparalleled. The most interesting part is that though I have readers across all languages, the Marathi people have been the most critical. They do a critical reading of my work, which I appreciate as these are intelligent readers in Marathi.”

Hailing the warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj , Bhyrappa said, “Historically speaking, when Indian culture was being weakened, it was Shivaji who had first gathered strength and fought off the enemies. This inspired a lot of people to follow suit, particularly in the country’s southern part. This warrior spirit is intrinsic to Maharashtrian people and carried forward to whatever field they work in.”

He said three-fourths of the Indian freedom struggle was fought in Maharashtra. “All this reflect the warrior spirit of Mahrashtrians. This quality I admire the most and it is even reflected in the politics here.”

Veteran actor Mohan Aghashe, translator Uma Kulkarni and theatre personality BV Rajaram, among others, were present at the event.

Citing an experience from his film ‘Astu’, Agashe said, “Two major characters in the film are from the border and speak Kannada. One of the Kannada lullabies in the movie became popular in both states. I think art, literature, theatre and films are an integrating factor for all of us. Politicians may try to differentiate us, but we will stand united.”

Illustration used for representational purpose

BAREILLY: In a freak accident, a 47–year-old farmer was allegedly crushed in a sugar mill in Rajpura area of Sambhal district recently when he accidentally fell into the cane belt.

The victim was identified as Chiranji Lal, a resident of Dharmpur Tappa village in Budaun.

According to sources, the accident occurred on January 9, but the matter came to light only on Saturday when Lal’s son Lalaram approached police. Based on his complaint, police have registered a case against unidentified persons of the mill management under section 304A (causing death by negligence) of IPC.

According to Lalaram, he and his father had brought cane in a tractor trolley to the sugar mill on January 9 when the incident happened. After weighing the loaded cane, Lalaram started waiting in the queue while his father was standing near the cane belt.

Lalaram said that when he came back after unloading cane, he couldn’t find his father there. Meanwhile, other farmers present there grew suspicious that Lal had slipped into the cane belt. When they examined the CCTV footage, they found that he fell into the belt after a tractor had hit him. As more cane buried him before he could escape, the belt pushed him towards the crushers, he added.

Rajpura station house officer Amit Kumar said, “We have examined the CCTV footage. It appears that the farmer accidently fell into the cane belt.”

Meanwhile, mill management official Randheer Singh said that they have set up an inquiry to investigate how the farmer reached the cane belt. “We are examining the matter and strict action will be taken against the negligent official concerned,” he added.

Kids and elders dance at Happy Streets in Kharadi on Sunday

PUNE: The morning was chilly and misty, but that was barely a deterrent for enthusiasm, as over 3,000 people joined the season’s first Happy Streets in Kharadi.

One flank of the South Main Road in Kharadi, which leads towards the EON IT park, was appropriated for Sunday’s Happy Street. As the winter sun filtered through on Sunday morning, people trickled in from nearby and far away places.

“I love the Happy Streets concept. It was held once near my house, and my family and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is great to have an uninterrupted stretch of road to just walk, cycle or relax with all the activities lined-up,” said Ishika Ghosh, who drove to Kharadi with her son from Kalyaninagar.

A particular point of interest was the SWaCH outreach stall, where the organization collected old and used clothes, toys, shoes, e-waste and other items to recycle and reuse. SWaCH representatives also explained the collection-to-recycling chain to the attendees. Some visitors even arrived with bags of cloth or e-waste.

“A number of people delivered bags of recyclable waste, like their old clothes and shoes, and even their old electronic gadgets. We told them about our organization and our waste-collectors’ network across the city. We also told them about our new collection points,” said Vishal Devaki, a member of SWaCH collective, helping out in the outreach initiative at the stall.

A selfie and photo frames and an instant photo booth, set up a little further down the road by Nyati, were another big hit. Several attendees lined up to click photographs with their loved one and save the memories they created during the fun filled day. The wide traffic-free boulevard was a boon for pets and people alike.

Only traffic on the stretch were people on skateboards, roller-skates and bicycles. Some of them were brought by the attendees themselves, while others were hired on rent for free.

Besides the bicycles, children had a field day on the street, with everything from hula hoops to a life-size game of snakes-and-ladders. Children also had an opportunity to paint the streets with coloured chalks.

Meanwhile, energy reverberated off the main stage as Zumba and dance instructors took participants through a fun dance-and-exercise routine. Children, adolescents and their parents lined up in front of the stage to shake a leg to the routine for a while — a blend of Western dance to Indian-inspired forms, with some elements of Arabic belly-dancing— before heading down the street. “I loved the Zumba. It was an amazing routine. That was the first time I tried belly-dancing. It wasn’t easy, but it was fun,” said Swati Goyal, a local resident.

Happy Streets is an initiative of The Times of India, in association with the Pune police and Pune Municipal Corporation , powered by Nyati Group.

Allahabad: Ministry of human resource development ( MHRD ) has asked the Allahabad University authorities to nominate two members from the executive council (EC) to constitute a search committee for the appointment of a regular vice-chancellor of the university.

AU will soon publish an advertisement for the post and a three-member committee will select the candidate. The appointment will be approved by the President, who is also the Visitor of the central university.

As per practice, HRD ministry instructs the university concerned to nominate two members of the EC and send the names to the ministry.

Another member is added to the search committee which is nominated by the Visitor (President) and is called as Visitor’s nominee. This team of three members scrutinizes the candidature of applicants applying for the post of VC.

After interaction with applicants, the panel forwards the names of 3-5 shortlisted candidates to the Visitor who takes a final decision.

Now, that the HRD ministry has asked the university to nominate two members from the executive council, it is likely that AU will call a meeting of the council next week and decide the members who will be nominated to the search committee. Officiating VC Prof RR Tewari will decide the date of EC’s meeting and will preside over it.

Confirming the development, AU Registrar Prof NK Shukla said, “HRD ministry has asked us to send the names of two persons who will be nominated as members of the search committee. We will call a meeting of EC in coming days.” He added that the university would soon come out with the advertisement for the post of VC. “About a month’s time will be given to applicants to apply for the post after which the work of search committee will begin,” he said.

The post had fallen vacant after former vice-chancellor Ratan Lal Hangloo tendered his resignation on January 1 following allegations of corruption. He was under scanner over alleged financial and administrative irregularities.

He was facing charges of irregularities since 2016 and was also summoned by the National Commission for Women (NCW) over allegations of improper handling of sexual harassment complaints and lack of a grievance redressal mechanism for female students.

TimesView Something like this can be a huge psychological safety boost for citizens and act as a long-term deterrent against crime. There are logistical problems but it would be great if this can be replicated across the city.

KOLKATA: Kolkata Police has managed to bring down its response time to a crisis call to 10 minutes on an average, thanks to the 82 patrol vehicles staying on roads for 24 hours for 70-odd police stations across the city.In addition, patrolling by multiple bikes and local vehicles enables the police to press over 300 two-wheelers and four-wheelers into action to respond to the SOS received from various parts of the city. The sudden rise in both visibility and effective intervention by the police to a crisis is being attributed to the Police Control Room (PCR) vans introduced in the city last year.“The new PCR vans introduced in December are already making a difference. The vans are not only responding to crisis calls but also their GPS tracking and live feedback systems help both the Lalbazar central control and the divisional control room take the needed steps. As cops know that PCR vans are around in the city, they are responding quickly to such calls. There are 27 PCR vans on duty at any point of the day while total 60 vehicles are requisitioned for the purpose,” said a police officer.The PCR vans patrol the city in three shifts. Cops send back a vehicle to its base only when another vehicle arrives. Each division is allotted three PCR vans while divisional DCPs deploy the vehicles and assign their patrolling areas. If any van gets stuck somewhere, the control rooms get to know about it immediately with the help of the GPS, added the officer.Special Shakti jeeps for women cops, quick response teams, HRFS and RFS, vehicles of OCs and 10 bikes also patrol the city daily. The number of these vehicles goes up at night.The police at Lalbazar are strengthening their women Scooty patrol teams, the number of which is likely to increase to 33 from the existing 23. With the wireless section of Kolkata Police releasing maximum vehicles from various divisions, each police station is expected to have at least two motorbikes and two four-wheelers for effective patrolling.

SHAHJAHANPUR: Police on Sunday thwarted attempts of Congress and social organizations to assemble a gathering in order to stage an anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protest without taking permission of the district administration by preventing most of the protesters from reaching Shaheed Park here on Sunday.

Police took proactive measures by barricading sensitive spots to prevent protesters from outside the district from entering the city. The curbs were in place on Saturday itself, with police checking vehicles at sensitive spots. Hotel owners were asked to provide information about “suspicious” guests on their premises. A heavy force was deployed to patrol railway stations and bus stands.

In-charge of local intelligence unit CB Singh and his team made sure that all the sensitive information was gathered and shared with senior officials to tackle any untoward situation, if any.

As a result of the strict vigilance, only 250 protesters, mostly Congress workers, gathered outside Shaheed Park, which is almost opposite the party office, and shouted anti-CAA slogans.

Meanwhile, Tasneem Ali Khan, outgoing president of the Congress city unit who had planned to lead the protest, told TOI, “It was a protest called for the people of India against CAA. People of every community supported us. We were expecting nearly 10,000 people but police barricaded most of the entrance points. We wanted to take out a peaceful march from Shaheed Park to Clock Tower but police did not give us permission, citing that section 144 of the CrPC is imposed in the district. However, BJP, led by state minister and local MLA Suresh Khanna, was granted permission to take out a march in favour of CAA. We were discriminated. We are ready to face any action because we know that we didn’t do any wrong.”

Additional SP (City) Dinesh Tripathi said, “We ensured that peace was maintained during the protest and several protesters changed their mind after we informed them that the district administration had not granted permission for the protest. We are identifying people who joined the protest and will be booking them for violating section 144.”

She was rushed to a local hospital from where she was referred to a higher centre in Meerut as her condition deteriorated. According to the girl’s family, the victim was being constantly tortured by her aunt mentally over a personal dispute. The family also alleged that they had complained to the police on earlier occasions too but didn’t get any response

It has been alleged that the aunt used to call the girl “characterless” in front of her friends and classmates. She was also threatening to put up ‘defamatory’ posters of the victim in a bid to further malign her character. According to sources, the dispute over property between her uncle and her family has been going on for several years. The victim’s father was even arrested by Adarsh Mandi police but no action was taken against her uncle.

On Sunday, the girl locked the door of her room and set herself ablaze. After getting the information, area police rush to spot and rescued her after breaking the door. The girl’s father Rakesh said, ""There is a property dispute between my brother and me. I was even arrested by police on the basis of my brother’s complaint but police have never taken any action against him. My daughter was being harassed by the aunt.”

<p>RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat <br></p>

BAREILLY: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said here on Sunday that just one organisation or ideology cannot decide the future of India. Addressing hundreds of RSS workers at an event at MJPR University, Bhagwat said that founders of the nation were from different ideologies. “But, they had one thing in common — nationalism, based on which they chalked out the roadmap for the Independent India,” he said.

“No single organisation or ideology can decide the future of India. People from all walks will decide it. All our great leaders who struggled for Independence were nationalist. And the roadmap designed by the founding fathers of the nation is enough for the RSS to follow as our vision completely matches with that,” he said, quoting communist leader Rajani Palme Dutta, Rabindranath Tagore, Mahatma Gandhi and BR Ambedkar.

However, he expressed disappointment over the current position of the country, saying that 70 years’ time was not a short period to develop the country on the lines of what our great leaders wanted to achieve.

“Israel got independence with us. In its first 30 years of independence, the country faced as many as five wars and won them all. Today, Israel exports everything from grains to latest technology to world. Similarly, we have example of Germany and Japan that were completely destroyed after World War II. But today, Germany is among the top most nations in Europe,” he said.

He said that as a nation, we can achieve the ultimate goal only with accepting others’ point of view those who have different ideologies than us. “Not only tolerance but acceptance of others’ point of view has always been our culture, ” he said.

He further said that that merely changing the way of worship doesn’t mean that one is not Hindu now. “All those whose forefathers were Hindu are still Hindu. And keeping this in mind we should cooperate and coordinate with each other to make a future India,” he said.

He also took a potshot at those who term RSS a fascist organisation. “Fascists always grab power, but we have always been away from it. Those people are running a propaganda to tarnish our image. Their history and their present, in fact, have exposed them. One should always remember that RSS will never end. Those who had tried to end us have now been wiped out,” he said.

The RSS chief also denied reports in some newspapers about his support to two children policy. “It has been published quoting me that there should be two children policy, which I have never said. In my view, population is a problem but at the same time it can be developed into resources. After considering all aspects, there must be a policy by government with general consensus to implement on everybody. Only the government will decide what number of kids a family should have. By this (incident) it appears that some prejudiced minds have decided what is next on our agenda.”

Allahabad: Department of medieval and modern history at Allahabad University will soon relaunch its historical journal after a gap of 80 years.

Being started by head of the department of medieval and modern history Prof Yogeshwar Tewari, the journal will have papers contributed by eminent scholars and academicians.

“The historical journal was first published in early 1920s after Sir Shafaat Ahmed Khan succeeded LF Rushbrook Williams (founder of the department) as the department’s head in 1921. This prestigious journal was published annually till early 1940s after which it was discontinued,” Prof Tewari said.

“The journal was known for its content which was academically enlightening and helped a lot in the development of Indian historical thought which was in its formative years then,” he added.

The contributors of the journal included meritorious students of the department as well as professors and historians like Prof CB Tripathi, Prof BN Pandey and Prof DN Shukla.

The journal had a nationwide reputation and was widely read in the academic circles of not just India but in many foreign countries too.

After around eight decades, the journal is being revived to promote academic potential of the department.

“The historical journal is likely to be launched this month itself. The upcoming issue will include popular articles of previous issues and recent contribution of prominent academicians of the department,” Prof Tewari said.

70,['20/01/2020'],Alarming rise in stomach ailments recorded in city,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Hyderabad: Stomach ailments among the city’s residents have seen a sharp jump over the past three years. Unlike yesteryears, these ailments are now taking longer to cure, say experts.

The instances of stomach ulcers, liver infections, diarrhoeal diseases and rectal diseases have seen an increase of up to 40% in the city. The rise in stomach ailments can lead to further complications like liver failure and stomach cancer. These ailments are primarily caused due to eating habits and frequent consumption of unhygienic food.

“After eating out at weekends, many patients come with an acute bout of vomiting and diarrhoea. Many are seen to have repeated episodes of these problems. Moreover, these diseases could be cured within a short period of time earlier but now they require prolonged treatment,” said Dr Kona S Lakshmi, gastrointestinal consultant, Geneagles Global Hospital, adding the organisms that cause these diseases are becoming resistant to medicine.

Experts said that stomach ailments may be rising due to medical misuse of drugs as well. Speaking about the increase in rectal diseases, Dr Srinivas Kongara, consultant, Hitam Institute of Anorectal Diseases, Madinaguda said, “Having more processed food like pizzas, burgers and frequent consumption of outside food loaded with spices is causing increasing cases of constipation which leads to further complications like piles and fissures. These cases are rising at an alarming rate.” He suggested having home cooked food, cutting out on refined and processed food and adding more fibre, fruits & vegetables in the diet.

Increasing consumption of fast foods, deeply fried foods and possible contamination of food and water is a possible risk factor for increasing prevalence of gastrointestinal diseases including acidity/dyspepsia. “These also cause repeated infections in the intestines. In the long run, these can progress to irritable bowel syndrome, stomach ulcers and cancers,” pointed out Dr Moka Praneeth, consultant gastroenterologist, Medicover hospitals.

Vadodara: A teacher from Anand murdered his wife, who too was a teacher in Chhota Udepur district, and fled with their two sons late on Saturday night.

According to police, the accused Mukesh Zala and his wife Alpa Zala (35) got into heated arguments on Saturday night over domestic issues at Gadh Boriyad village in Naswadi taluka. In a fit of rage Mukesh picked up an iron griddle and hit Alpa with it. Police said that the deceased’s throat was also slit by the griddle’s sharp edges besides injuring her head. After killing his wife, Mukesh fled from the spot taking his two minor sons, aged eight and six years, along with him.

Cops said that the killing came to light on Sunday morning when Alpa’s sister called her on her mobile phone, but the calls went unanswered.

The sister then called her neighbour asking to check on Alpa. When the neighbour entered the house, he was shocked to find Alpa lying in a pool of blood and informed her sister and father. They rushed to Naswadi.

Alpa’s father alleged that Mukesh and his daughter had been going through tension for past sometime and probably killed her for it. Based on the father’s statements, a case of murder was registered against Mukesh at Naswadi police station.

“The deceased’s kin stated that Mukesh used to get angry at her over petty issues and often checked her mobile phone out of suspicion,” said a police official.

Cops said that the couple, who got married in 2010, hail from Balasinor in Mahisagar district but were living in Anand as Mukesh works there. Alpa taught at a primary school in Khareda village in Naswadi and used to commute daily between Anand and Khareda. But, seven months back the couple had got a new house in Gadh Boriyad and Alpa moved there with the children.

72,['20/01/2020'],"Pune: In Pimple Saudagar, a key underpass nears completion","This story is from January 20, 2020

The underpass at Govind Garden chowk in Pimple Saudagar has been thrown open to the public, but civil works are ongoing. At the current rate, the entire project, which was opened in phases, is set to miss an already extended deadline.

After it failed to meet the first deadline in June 2019, the Rs 9-crore project of the PCMC — along the Nashik Phata-Kokane chowk BRTS route — was handed an extension until the end of 2019. The flyover has been opened for service, but there’s still work pending on its finishing and the service lanes.

The PCMC said the entire project will be finished by the end of January.

“A drainage line was identified in the vicinity of the work site. It has been marked for an overhaul. That is why there have been delays. Most of the project is complete — the rest will be finished in a month’s time,” said Sanjay Kashid, deputy engineer, PCMC.

The underpass connects Pimple Saudagar and Pimpri and saves people the trouble of taking a detour.

“The road has finally opened. But it’s still a kutcha one. It took a long time and in the past 20 months, we have been using the alternative arrangements put in place by the PCMC,” said Rohit Shinde, a resident of Pimple Saudagar.

Motorists here often resorted to making U-turns at broken medians and also at breaches along the corridor for a quick pass. The violations complicated the traffic situation and put lives at risk.

“One fails to understand why the PCMC did not think of this flyover at the chowk, when it opened the road in November 2015. It would have made life easier for everyone in the locality,” said Dnyaneshwar Oak, a resident of Rahatani.

Motorists said they have had to negotiate numerous potholes, broken roads, gravel and missing footpaths for nearly two years.

Officials from the PCMC have in the past cited several reasons for problems at the site — from bad planning to lack of sufficient funds when the stretch first opened in 2015.

Though the road provides a thoroughfare to all those going from Pimple Saudagar to Pimpri and vice versa, the rest of the civil works, including relayering of footpath, is still work in progress.

“The footpaths are a part of the smart city initiative and cabling is being carried out. The footpath will extend all the way from Nashik Phata to Kokane chowk,” said Kashid.

According to sources within the PCMC, the contractor is responsible for all the civil works in and around any infrastructure project and he has to ensure that roads are in good shape.

“Much of the road around a work site gets damaged due to use of heavy machinery, but it is clear that contractors have to fix these problems,” said a PCMC official.

An engineer at the site said in the case of Govind Garden chowk, both the PCMC and the contractor were not aware of what was beneath the ground and part of the delay was also because they found pipe networks and black cotton soil — two factors that forced them to do quite a bit of re-engineering.

Citizens, however, said they remain hopeful of improvements at the junction. “It definitely has been a long time coming. And we have no choice but to stay patient,” said Pramod Mane, a local resident.

He added: “The PCMC has to carry out numerous other civil works in the area. All of us hope that planning capabilities have improved.

Representative image

BIJNOR: Dharmendra Yadav, Samajwadi Party (SP) leader and cousin of former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav , met family members of Suleiman and Anas - the two men who were killed in firing during anti-CAA protests in Bijnor’s Nahtaur town on December 20, 2019.

Dharmendra also handed over cheques of Rs 5 lakh to each of the grieving families on Sunday and termed both the deceased as “innocent”. The SP leader claimed that culprits will be punished if their government comes to power.

Suleiman’s uncle, Afzal Ahmed Usmani, confirmed that family members have received a cheque of Rs 5 lakh on Sunday. “We are thankful to Akhilesh Yadav. But, we will get justice only after the erring policemen who shot dead Suleiman is put behind bars.”

The ex-MP was accompanied by former state minister Moolchand Chauhan and Swami Omvesh, MLA Manoj Paras and Tasleem Ahmed. They reached Nahtaur on Sunday and met the family and gave them monetary support.

Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Dharmendra said, “We have come here on the instructions of party leader and former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav and met the grieving families. We have given them a cheque of Rs 5 lakh to each. Besides, a cheque of Rs 50,000 was handed to a man named Omraj Saini who sustained bullet injuries during the protests on December 20. Our party has been assisting all the victims in UP. Akhilesh Yadav will also come to west UP soon.”

Lashing out at the BJP government, he said, “The entire country knows that BJP has been playing divisive and politics of hate. The CAA is unconstitutional as Muslims were kept out of it. We are opposing it and will never accept it. Everyone knows how the protesters were framed in false cases. All cases against protesters will be revoked and the erring will be put behind bars if SP comes to power.”

Dharmendra also criticised the Congress for not doing enough. “Congress did nothing for the victims. They only paid lip service to those who died while our party is assisting the grieving families and providing monetary support to the victims,” he said.

Notably, protests against CAA turned violent in eight towns of Bijnor. Bijnor and Nahtaur were most affected. In Nahtaur, two persons were killed in firing. Cops later admitted that Suleiman was killed in police firing in self-defence during the protests while Anas was killed by stray bullet.

74,['20/01/2020'],5-year-old lost during Sankranti snan waits to reunite with family,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Allahabad: Days after being separated from his parents during Makar Sankranti snan in Magh Mela, five-year-old boy Raj is still waiting to meet his parents. He was shifted to Shishu Bal Grih in Khuldabad on Sunday.

The kid was found at a ghat in Mela area under Jhunsi thana set up at the Mela. The police later brought Raj to the Bhule bhatke Shivir (lost and found camp) being run by family members of Raja Ram Tiwari at sector one in Mela compound.

“The kid was in a state of shock initially and was unable to tell his name for few hours. Later he told us he is the son of Dheeraj and Jyoti. However, he is still unable to recall the name of the place he came from”, said Umeshchandra Srivastava, convenor of the shivir.

Raj only remembers that his parents boarded ‘Rail gadi’ (train) and came to the Mela on Makar Sankranti.

“Since the day he was brought here at the camp, everyone in the Mela area was trying to make the kid happy, some offering chocolates others showing films on mobile”, said Tewari. But after a momentarily smile, there is long blank in his eyes, enough to tell his plight.

He was shifted to Shishu Bal Grih in Khuldabad on Sunday from Childline where he was handed over by Mela authorities on Saturday.

Talking to TOI, superintendent of Shishu Grah, Harish Srivastava said, “He only remembers his parents name and remains silent otherwise.”

However, pilgrims in Mela area were unhappy over the entire issue as they believe that had the bhule bhatke shivir being allowed to broadcast the message pertaining to name of the kid or his whereabouts on the very first day—as was being done in the early years—the kid could have met his parents by now.

The organisers of the Shivir were asked to stop their announcement on the very first day of the Magh Mela (January 10) when the contractor who supplied them with public address system and the basic infrastructure, withdrew the logistic saying that the mela administration has asked the same.

However, nodal officer, Magh Mela police, Ashutosh Mishra said, “We have decided that the announcements being made by the bhule bhatke shivir would start from January 20”.

76,['20/01/2020'],Kolkata: PWD to check pipes under BT Road,"This story is from January 20, 2020

KOLKATA: The state PWD is keen to check physically the underground Tallah-Palta water pipelines to prevent any leakage like the one that happened under B T Road near Tallah Bridge in April last year. The PWD issued a Rs 17.2 lakh tender last week to check the underground pipeline in a 100-metre stretch near the zone.

PWD sources said they will make a trench cut on the BT Road stretch to verify the underground pipelines. The trench cut, PWD engineers said, is a long narrow ventilation hole, which will allow them access below. The PWD officials have decided that those, who have experience in trench cutting for the last five years, will be allowed to apply for the bids. The work will start in a month, according to sources.

The Tallah Bridge demolition is likely to start in the first week of February while the construction of the proposed new bridge is likely to start in April. The trench cut verification may be done before the new bridge construction, sources said.

However, the April incident showed the complexities in dealing with water pipeline leakage below the BT Road. Several water mains under BT Road carry filtered water from the Palta water treatment plant to Tallah water reservoir and pumping stations. A KMC water supply department official said that at least five metres below the ground, four major pipelinescarry filtered water from the Palta to Tallah.

The KMC water supply team had taken several hours to repair the breach in the pipe in April last year. A trench had to be dug for workers to climb down and find the breach, which happened days after the civic body’s unsuccessful attempt to repair a water main under the Cossipore railway tracks.

While the Tallah Bridge demolition will not pose much threat to the underground pipelines, the construction of the new bridge will require a detailed mapping of the pipelines, according to sources.

“A physical verification is required and it has to be very specific,” said an official. Any breach or leakage which may require repair could lead to water crisis in various parts of north and central Kolkata, added the official.

Hyderabad: After receiving several complaints from students and faculty members of affiliated colleges, the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad (JNTU-H) has introduced online grievance redressal service through Academic Audit Cell Portal.

While the faculty members can register their grievances by logging in with their credentials, students have to use the newly-created ‘student corner’ option on the portal to report an issue. “The university has received various grievances from both faculty members and students of affiliated colleges/institutions on various issues. In this connection, to redress grievances and strengthen the grievance redressal mechanism, the university has initiated online grievance redressal service on the Academic Audit Cell Portal,” read a circular released by the varsity.

Apart from submitting their grievances, students can also view updates from time to time at the student corner on the portal. Further, the varsity also directed all college managements to be proactive and take the initiative to resolve the grievances raised by their faculty members and students at the college/institute level itself.

Meanwhile, students and faculty members welcomed the move and said having an online grievance redressal service is the need of the hour as most of their problems are not addressed by the college despite making several representations. They said that the varsity should now play an active role and ensure that all the grievances raised through the portal are addressed in a timely manner.

Jaipur: Before implementing the impact fee on violators of building bylaws, the state urban development and housing (UDH) department is seeking legal advice.

Recently, the department decided to impose an impact fee on illegal buildings to discourage the rampant practice in cities. According to the official, the UDH minister has given an in-principal approval to the government and asked it to prepare a legal frame work to implement the new law. “The draft has been discussed by senior authorities. Directions have been given to chalk out legal framework for its implementation,” said an official at town planning wing.

Once the concept is introduced, owners of commercial properties that violate building bylaws will have to pay penalty every year. But for residential properties, a one-time impact fee will be imposed. An official source said, “As per the preliminary discussions, the resident owners who will violate the bylaws will have to pay 1% of the district lease committee rate (DLC) one time. However, it is not finalised yet.”

Sources further said the state government will only implement the fee after the local bodies election as it might face protest from opposition parties and residents.

For the implementation of the fee, the department will also amend the building bylaws after the approval. An official informed, the Rajasthan High Court had earlier asked the government to discourage the practice of regularising illegal constructions and ordered to impose heavy penalty on such buildings. It was also directed to raze or seal the illegal construction. However, the state government filed a Special Leave Petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court challenging the high court order claiming it would involve largescale demolition.

The move is expected to curb the illegal practices in the city including zero setback construction, covering parking areas and open spaces. Sources said in the previous government, the department had constituted a four-member committee to frame rules and regulations for sealing and opening illegal buildings in all municipal corporations, urban improvement trust (UIT) and development authorities. However, the committee failed to function effectively.

KOLKATA: After targeting elderly residents and salaried professionals, conmen have now turned their attention towards school students, duping them of expensive gadgets and petty cash after threatening to inform their families of the teenage secrets they would like to keep to themselves. Officers of Netaji Nagar police station came across one such incident on Saturday when a 16-year-old boy returning home from tuition was stopped by two men who claimed to be relatives of a girl the boy had grown friendly with at the tuition. They threatened to inform the matter to his parents and made off with his cellphone and some cash.The incident was reported around 6.45pm when the boy was passing by a pond in Ranikuthi.“The men stopped him and said they knew the kind of text messages he sent the girl. They said since the boy hangs out with the girl against her family’s wishes, they would inform his parents about it. When the Class XI student pleaded with them to not to do so, they demanded money from him. On the pretext of checking his cellphone, they even took the gadget and fled the spot,” said an officer.It was only after the boy realised that he had been conned that he informed his parents and they lodged a complaint for the loss of a wallet containing Rs 600 and a cellphone worth Rs 9,400. “We have started a case of cheating and criminal conspiracy and are probing the incident. It looks like a case of cheating by conmen,” said an officer.Time and again, conmen have targeted a variety of people — from elderly residents to homemakers, and from salaried professionals to businessmen. But, cops said, targeting schoolkids is something that has cropped up recently.“These days, all teenagers have expensive gadgets, like cellphones, digital notepads and laptops, along with some money. Hence, they become easy targets,” said another officer.An officer said they have issued advisories asking citizens to be aware of conmen and not to give hand over personal items to unknown persons under any inducement or threat. “We are asking citizens to be more alert and parents to be more friendly with children so they do not freak out in the face of simple threats made by random persons.

JAIPUR: For more than two months now, the elusive leopard which has taken refuge inside the sprawling Smriti Van has kept morning walkers at bay.

Few residents, however, have even come forward and requested authorities to allow them entry to the park after signing an affidavit. However, their request has been turned down by the forest administration claiming it to be not ‘feasible’.

A senior government official, who regularly visit the park said, “If you visit Smirti Van once, its difficult to like any other place for morning walk in Jaipur. Now I go for a walk on my office premises, but it is nowhere close. Jhalana has been always the home for leopards since ages and human have encroached upon their space. It’s a challenge for the forest department to maintain a man-animal coexistence system. Having said that, a middle path still has to be found because the park cannot be close indefinitely.”

This is for the first time that public entry to the biological park has been prohibited for such a long period. The forest department has installed three cages in the park, but all efforts have been futile till now.

A forest official said the feline was being regularly tracked and after monitoring it movement, the department was deliberating a plan to open the park soon after imposing restrictions. “We recently inspected the park to track the movement of the big cat. At present, the movement of the female leopard is near MNIT and temple area. We are earmarking a track on which morning walkers will be allowed.”

The increasing population of leopards has resulted in shortage of space at Jhalana forest area in Jaipur. This indirect proportion has forced the big cats to venture out of the forest and into human settlements to look for new territories. A forest official said, “There are five to seven sub-adults at the park. The leopards that ventured out are also subadults. The area of Jhalana is 22 square kilometre and the big cat population is higher than its carrying capacity.”

84,['20/01/2020'],"Civic body proposes 5 new wards, seeks public opinion","This story is from January 20, 2020

Vijayawada: The town planning wing of the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation ( VMC ) has completed its exercise on delimitation of wards under its jurisdiction. The civic body has proposed that the number of wards be increased to 64, up from 59 at present.

The civic body has published ‘Form 1’, explaining the proposed new divisions in the city and invited residents and political parties to raise objections and suggestions.

The decision to increase the number of wards comes after municipal authorities conducted a detailed study and proposed that five new wards be created by dividing wards with high population density .

The population of Vijayawada city saw an increase after it became a part of the Amaravati capital region. The number of voters in the city is around 7.2 lakhs out of an estimated total population of around 12.5 lakhs.

Opposition parties, however, expressed unhappiness with the divisions proposed by the VMC. “It seems that VMC authorities worked as per the directions of the ruling party. We are unhappy with the way officials did the delimitation process. City population increased drastically in recent times but officials considered the 2011 Census for the process. This is not acceptable,” said Communist Party of India (Marxist) state secretariat member Ch Babu Rao.

Jana Sena official spokesperson Pothina Venkata Mahesh demanded the state government merge Jakkampudi and Kothuru Tadepalli panchayats with Vijayawada city. “VMC oversees sanitation and other core issues in Jakkamudi affordable housing colony, yet it is a separate panchayat. The civic body is constructing several affordable houses at Jakkmpudi, Kothuru Tadepalli and Shahbaad panchayats and the VMC is bound to take up sanitation there. The government should merge these villages with Vijayawada,” he said.

CPI(M) city secretary Donepudi Shankar demanded the VMC to extend the time for submission of objections and suggestions on new divisions.

The town planning wing of the VMC has given one week’s time for raising objections.

Kanpur: The month of January, usually known for receiving scanty winter showers, has witnessed unprecedented rains this year. The city has so far received 80mm of rainfall, which is eight times more than the average rainfall for this month. The average rainfall for January in Kanpur is 10 mm.

The city had never witnessed such rain in past 49 years. According to data available with the Met department of CSA University, the city had never received 80 mm rainfall since 1971 in the month of January.

While the rain has not ended the winter spell, it has caused damage to winter crops such as pea, chickpea, pulse etc. Hailstorms at some places, especially in city outskirts, damaged crops leaving farmers in trouble.

Earlier, when light rains lashed the city in the first week of December, farmers were happy as showers were beneficial for the Rabi crop but heavy rains that pounded the city between January 15 and January 17, damaged the crops. The mustard crop, which was in flowering stage was also hit.

“We are maintaining weather data since 1971. According to the available data, the city has never experienced 80 mm of rainfall this month. In 2014, 67.4 mm of rainfall was registered on January 18, but this year it has breached the rain data”, said Agrometerologist at CSA University, Prof Naushad Khan.

“The heavy rains have caused damage to chickpeas, gram, lentil, pea crops which were in the critical vegetative stage. The earlier light rains had benefitted the crops but they suffered huge damage after the heavy downpour”, he added.

Prof Khan said the rainfall also caused damage to wheat and potato crops. “Plants died as the fields got flooded with water resulting in huge loss to farmers. Also, the wind speed in the past days was quite high which further added to the woes of the farmers. Rains will keep crop productivity low”, he said.

The rains were caused due to western disturbance, and heavy snowfall in the hills of Uttarakhand and in Kashmir was the reason for rains in the plains, Prof Khan added.

The Met department could not rule out the possibility of more rains in the coming days. In the case of another western disturbance, it can still rain again.

Meanwhile, the spell of extreme chill continued in the city as day temperature continued to remain below 20 degrees Celsius.

BIJNOR: A day after a charred body of a woman was found in an orchard merely 500 meters away from Delhi-Pauri National Highway here at Gajraul village area, superintendent of police Sanjeev Tyagi has formed around 10 teams to solve the case. Around seven teams have been sent to neighbouring districts to check the record of the missing women.

It has become hard nut to crack for the police to identify the body. According to officials, autopsy of the body is being conducted and details will come out late on Sunday night.

City’s superintendent of police Lakshmi Nivas Mishra said, “We have formed around 10 teams. Out of them, seven teams have been sent to neighbouring districts with the aim to identify the woman. They are checking records of the missing women there.”

“In Bijnor , there are around 13 women who are reported to be missing. Prima facie, deceased woman was not among them. That is why police are checking record of missing women in neighbouring districts,” Mishra added.

He further stated, “Post mortem of the body is going on. We can ascertain the nature of the crime only after we get autopsy report. Woman was disfigured. But we have got a picture of her distorted face which we have circulated on social platform. We have appealed all persons to help the cops to identify her.”

The charred body of a woman in her mid-twenties was found in Gajraula under Bijnor city police station area, barely 500 metres away from the Delhi-Pauri national highway on Friday night. Police could ascertain the age only from one foot that escaped the fire. According to the police, the woman appeared to be from a well-to-do family as she wore gold bangles and earrings.

Police recovered two used and a live cartridge from the ashes. The accused used a wooden cot to burn the body.

The incident came to light on Friday evening when a local contractor reached the spot and saw the burnt body. He informed the cops.

In an identical incident on December 24, 2018, the body of a woman – most likely in her thirties -- was found burnt near a canal here in Mundhal village of Bijnor. Police had set up a probe to identify the woman whose entire body, except half of her arm, was burnt in the incident. She was burnt by pouring patrol. Police are yet to crack that case.

The deceased cab driver was identified as 35-year-old Vishnu Nath who hailed from Alwar . Police have in their custody Subhash, a common acquaintance of the couple and the deceased driver. However, he has not been able to provide any clues to the absconding couple’s location. Three months ago, Ravindra had eloped with a girl from a village in Dausa district . A case had been registered against him but was withdrawn when the girl who he had eloped with said she went willingly.

Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy. (Image taken from his Twitter handle)

HYDERABAD: The municipal elections have come as an opportunity and also a major challenge to two Congress MPs who are front-runners in the race for the president of Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee .

The AICC leadership is likely to go for a change of guard in Telangana Congress and the performance of party seniors in ensuring the victory of Congress in municipal elections would play a significant role in finalization of the candidate for the coveted post.

The present incumbent and Nalgonda MP N Uttam Kumar Reddy has himself announced that he is expecting to be relieved of the post after municipal elections.

Among those in the race are Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy and Bhuvanagiri MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy.

These two MPs are now working hard to ensure the victory of party candidates to impress upon the AICC leadership that they can revive the party and bring it back to power in the state during the next assembly elections.

Though both Revanth and Venkat Reddy said that municipal elections should not be linked to the selection of PCC president and that AICC leadership has its own parameters and surveys based on which it finalizes the candidate, senior leaders in the Congress said the performance of party leaders in urban local body polls will definitely play a crucial role in finalization of the TPCC chief.

Four municipal corporations and 9 municipalities are going to polls in Malkajgiri Lok Sabha constituency limits and 13 urban local bodies in Bhuvanagiri parliamentary constituency.

Both Revanth and Venkat Reddy have been sweating it out to ensure the victory of party candidates in the ULBs.

Prestige is at stake for the Congress, which wants to prove that it is the main opposition party and an alternative to the TRS in Telangana, and not the BJP as being claimed by the saffron party.

Deepak Patel was attacked at an eatery outside the hostel campus

VADODARA: A student of MS University’s science faculty was arrested and seven others booked for thrashing a law student outside the boys’ hostel campus on Saturday evening.

Deepak Patel, a first-year LLB student, told the police that Nitinsinh Barad, who was arrested, along with Jeet Zala , Shantanusinh Chauhan, Balraj Bhatti, Jay Thakor and three other unidentified persons attacked him at an eatery outside the hostel campus. According to Patel, the accused were seeking revenge of an earlier clash between two groups of students’ at the science faculty on January 17.

The Royal Group and the All India Students’ Association (AISA) clashed at the science faculty over organizing youth festival. Members of the Royal Group alleged that because AISA’s faculty general secretary candidate was defeated in the students’ election, they were creating hurdles in organizing the festival. Following the clash the two groups had reached Sayajigunj police station with cross complaints, but reached a settlement later on.

Patel alleged that the accused, who are affiliated with AISA, had harboured grudges against him regarding the January 17 clash and despite the settlement, they attacked him on Saturday evening. In his complaint, he stated that the group members beat him up with wooden sticks and iron rods.

As a crowd gathered seeing the melee, the attackers left the spot but threatened Patel not to come to science faculty again. Patel’s friend took him to the SSG Hospital from where he was discharged after primary treatment. On Saturday night, Patel lodged a complaint of rioting, assault and criminal intimidation at Sayajigunj police station.

Based on his complaint, Barad, a student of science faculty was arrested on Sunday.

102,['20/01/2020'],"Congress should focus on economic crisis, not CAA: Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh","This story is from January 20, 2020

Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh

KOZHIKODE: Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh has said that the Congress party should lead an agitation on the economic crisis gripping the country and not on Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA )/National Population Register ( NPR ) as people see it as a Hindu-Muslim issue and added that the party should not allow the society to be polarized.

Speaking on the sidelines of the Kerala Literature Festival (KLF) which concluded here on Sunday, Ramesh said that BJP was waiting for Congress to take up the lead in CAA protests and the party would fall into their trap if it does so.

“CAA is a very sensitive issue. We have to be very careful that it does not become an instrument of Hindu- Muslim polarization. BJP wants to keep the debate of CAA/NPR alive while the most important issue in the country today is economic crisis with inflation going up and growth coming down. Congress should lead an agitation on economic crisis and not CAA/ NPR because economic crisis is not a Hindu-Muslim issue whereas people see CAA/NPR as a Hindu-Muslim issue,” he said, when asked about the perception that Congress is not taking the lead nationally on the CAA protests.

Referring to the passing of the resolution by Kerala assembly against CAA, Jairam Ramesh said that the state government cannot override CAA and added that any resolution of the state on CAA may not pass the constitutional test.

“To the best of my knowledge, citizenship is in the central list and not on the concurrent list. If it was in the concurrent list, the state assembly can override it. Any resolution on CAA may not pass the constitutional test. However on NPR/ NRC, it is a separate issue,” he said.

Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal had on Saturday, while participating in the KLF, said that no state can take the stand that it will not implement the CAA.

Ramesh said that the Congress party should also be careful not to fall into the CPM trap as well on the issue and added that the party cannot be led by the CPM.

“Congress party’s politics cannot be dictated by the CPM. It should not outsource its thinking and should think of its own. Left parties are relevant only in Kerala while Congress is relevant in 29 states and it has to fight the BJP. Pinarayi Vijayan looks only at Kerala politics. Sitaram Yechury looks at national politics but Yechury has more influence in the Congress that in the CPM. It is easier for CPM leaders to meet Rahul Gandhi than for Congress leaders to meet him,” he added.

Ramesh said that the only way one can deal with the unconstitutional CAA is by either Parliament passing a new law which will not happen unless Congress gets majority or Supreme Court striking it down.

He said that he was the first to approach the SC against the Act.

Asked about the role of regional parties in Indian politics, he said that Congress has to learn to deal with regional parties.

“Regional parties are a reality and they want respect. One of the mistakes Congress made in 2009 was that when the party got 210 seats it became very arrogant. There was no CMP in UPA-2 while there was CMP in UPA-1. The BJP is now making the same mistakes with regional parties as is reflected in breakup with Shiv Sena in Maharashtra,” he added.

“KTR is a failure as a municipal minister. The development in municipalities and municipal corporations came to a halt ever since TRS came to power.

PUNE: An 11-year-old boy drowned after he fell into an open overhead tank while flying his kite on the premises of the Pune Municipal Corporation ’s (PMC) water treatment plant in Vadgaon Budruk on Sunday afternoon.

The Sinhagad Road police said the boy and his elder brother had climbed the tank to fly kites when he slipped and fell into the tank which had no lid. “His brother raised an alarm after trying to search and rescue him,” inspector Sunil Takawale of Sinhagad Road police told TOI.

The police identified the deceased boy as Atharva Bapu Gore of Samarthnagar near Tukai temple in Vadgaon Budruk.

V G Kulkarni, head of PMC’s water department, told TOI, “The water treatment plant is surrounded by slums and people living there do not have direct road access to their dwellings. A part of the plant’s premises has been kept open for them to access their dwellings in Vadgaon Budruk areas. The PMC is developing a new thoroughfare for the residents and entry to the plant will be stopped once the facility is ready.”

According to the civic officials, as of now, entry to certain areas on the plant’s premises is restricted but some local residents frequently access these areas. Sometimes they quarrel and threaten the security guards when prevented from moving in the restricted areas.

The guards fear to prevent such elements from entering restricted areas following incidences of misbehaving and manhandling in the past.

“The security guards do not want to get roughed up by the locals. They try to stop people from going to these areas, but after a limit they do not force the issue out of apprehension,” a senior PMC officer, who did not wish to be named, said.

Inspector Takawale said Atharva and his brother Santosh had gone to the water tank for flying kites and were looking skywards while moving around when Atharva fell into the tank from an opening which had no lid. “Santosh then peeped inside the tank from the opening and made an attempt to search for Atharva, but failed. He then raised an alarm and local residents rushed to the spot,” he added.

Subsequently, the police and fire brigade officials reached the spot. The fire brigade officials entered the water tank and brought out Atharva who was motionless. He was taken to a nearby hospital where the doctors pronounced him dead, Takawale said.

Atharva was a sixth standard student of a local school, Takawale said. “Atharva’s father is a porter while mother works as a domestic help in the nearby societies,” he said.

Takawale said the water treatment plant area has an chain link fence but the residents of the slum near the plant cut the fence. It now has openings in many places and the boys entered the treatment plant area from one of them.

SECUNDERABAD: Despite the population nearly doubling with the development of new residential areas in Marredpally , Sitaphalmandi, Padmarao Nagar, Tarnaka, Lalapet, Mettuguda and other areas of Secunderabad almost a decade ago, residents here are still suffering from a shortage of drinking water .As the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) has failed to prepare fresh proposals to enhance the capacity of existing service reservoirs and construction of new reservoirs to meet the demand, problems related to drinking water supply in Secunderabad have only intensified. “The existing service reservoirs were built in the 1960s, with a capacity of 45 million litres, when the Manjeera water supply scheme was launched. The population has increased since then and the areas are saturated,” said an HMWS&SB official. Officials said that the water board is unable to construct new service reservoirs and is supplying Godavari and Krishna water to the residents on alternate days.General manager, O&M Divison-VII (Marredpally), K Ragunandan Reddy said, “The water board has been depending on the existing infrastructure to supply water. Two new reservoirs have been constructed, one at Osmania University, with a capacity of 5 million litres, and another one at Lalapet with a capacity of 3 million litres. Depending on the necessity, they will be commissioned.”With the commissioning of the two service reservoirs, OU, Mettuguda, Tarnaka and Manikeswara Nagar, Lalapet and the adjoining residential areas would benefit, he said.“Though the officials have been claiming that they would supply potable water on a daily basis, they cannot do it due to lack of infrastructure,” said Sai Krishna, a resident of Tarnaka. “The slums and tail-end areas suffer the most as they receive water with low pressure. The water board has to put in more efforts to quench the thirst of every resident.

Hyderabad: A day after two city doctors died of sudden cardiac arrest, experts on Sunday said that instances of sudden cardiac arrest among unfit people aged below 45 are increasing, what with several such cases being reported among teens and students of late.

Stating that there is a need to incentivise fitness at all levels, they said that besides stress and poor lifestyle, ignoring health issues also plays a key role in deteriorating one’s health.

In order to make preventive health and wellness attractive to the people, experts said that incentives could be introduced in the upcoming budget. “Under section 80D of the Income Tax Act of 1961, taxpayers can claim tax deductions on health checkups and health premiums, preventive wellness, however, is still placed under a high tax bracket. This year, however, we hope the budget goes beyond providing tax deductions to those recovering after falling ill, and supports and incentivises those who take care of their own fitness. This can include fitness services such as memberships to gyms, fitness studios and commercially-run yoga centers,” said Sarvesh Shashi, founder of Sarva, a yoga and wellness ecosystem.

Data from the World Economic Forum indicates that over 77% of Indians would be below the age of 45 by the next decade. “However, despite having a sizeable population of young people, we are also the most unfit, with estimates suggesting that 1 in every 3 Indians is unfit and suffers from preventable lifestyle diseases. There is a need to look at the preventive aspect seriously. Workplaces need to incentivise healthy practices,” said Dr Sanjeev Singh Yadav, secretary general, Indian Medical Association, Telangana.

While some offices do encourage healthy practices like cycling to work and maintain gyms, more workplaces need to provide such options, say employees. “In my previous office, I used to play basketball but after I shifted to another office, there is no option for recreational activities in the office and since I spend most of my time in office, I started ignoring my health. It would be good if companies encourage employees to be physically fit,” said Surendra B, who works with a startup.

Nagpur: The national and state highways authorities have found 66 accident-prone spots in Nagpur district. This was the finding of a study of road accidents in 2019. Of these, 24 are in Nagpur city alone.

While the study also revealed that rash and negligent driving has turned 47 spots into accident-prone ones, faulty road design was a major cause with regards to 19 spots becoming black spots.

According to Nagpur city traffic police data for 2019, the city witnessed 1,007 road accidents that left 250 dead and 1,042 injured. Roads under Nagpur rural police recorded 843 accidents killing 384 people and injuring 940.

During the study, it came to fore that despite reporting lesser number of road accidents in comparison to the city, rural areas have more number of accident-prone spots at 42.

Though the study failed to mention number of accidents occurred in these black spots, the study revealed that roads under Saoner and Umred police station jurisdictions have maximum numbers of accident-prone spots. Both the towns have seven black spots each. It was followed by Mouda, Kondhali and Hudkeshwar police stations with four black spots each. Roads passing through police station areas like Sonegaon, Butibori, Khaparkheda and Bhivapur have three black spots each.

The study also revealed that not only human negligence, but slow progress of developmental works like construction of flyovers, underbridges and road works too have contributed to several spots becoming accident-prone. As per the report, slow progress of flyover works in both Pardi and Kapsi too have caused black spots on the roads.

To eradicate accident-prone spots, the study has suggested both short-term and long-term measures. The agencies have suggested short-term measures like zebra crossings, warning boards, advanced signages, encroachment removal, rumbler strips, speed breaker etc.

According to an official, both NHAI (National Highways Authority of India) and state public works department (PWD) has succeeded in reducing the number of accident-prone spots identified in 2018. Of the 83 spots, these agencies have rectified over 70, the official added.

115,['20/01/2020'],Pune Municipal Corporation pledges increased trash processing capacity,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Pune MUnicipal University

PUNE: The civic body is trying to increase the capacity of direct processing of garbage up to 1,700 tonnes by the end of this year, for which it is improving the necessary infrastructure.

At present, the civic body daily processes around 1,350 tonnes of garbage (dry and wet) at its plants (see graphic). Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials said new processing plants were being established and the old facilities would be restored.

“These projects are likely to become operational to the full capacity by this year. Many of the projects are supposed to completed by April. Once the plants start processing garbage at their maximum capacity, we hope open dumping of garbage will stop for good,” said Dnyaneshwar Molak, head of the PMC’s solid waste management department.

PMC officials said the civic administration stopped dumping garbage in the open at the Uruli depot from last week, a practice that was in place for nearly 25 years.

The officials said the civic body was planning to produce various bi-products, including electricity and bricks, from the garbage plants.

Citizens’ activists are, however, sceptical about the civic administration claim and said the should take “cost-effective” measures. “The existing projects are not working properly. How can one guarantee that the PMC’s new plan will become a reality?” asked Vivek Velankar of citizens’ forum Sajag Nagrik Manch.

“A properly planned waste management system can help a government earn money. But the PMC is not approaching the problem in the right way,” he said.

MEERUT: Days after the body of a Delhi resident was fished out from a canal, a charred body of a man, probably in his late 20s, was found in a field in Dibai area of Bulandshahr district on Sunday morning. Police suspect that the man was shot dead at some other place. His body was brought to the field and set on fire to conceal his identity.

On being informed, local police arrived at the spot and took charge of the body and sent it for postmortem. The report is awaited. Forensic teams have collected samples from the spot and investigation in the case has begun, said senior police officers.

“The body was found in a field near the highway in Dibai, close to Galibpur village. Prima facie, it appears that the victim was shot dead and later, his body was set on fire to conceal his identity. We are trying to ascertain the identity of the deceased and only then, further probe in the case will be possible,” said Bulandshahr SSP Santosh Kumar Singh .

The deserted stretches of western UP and its canals have for long been used as “dumping ground” for bodies. According to sources in police, criminals dump bodies in the canals and in deserted pockets, hoping they will decompose and identification of the victims will becomes difficult.

In May last year, a headless body of a 23-year-old woman, with her fingers missing and torso bearing several brutal injury marks, was found dumped in a cane field in Bulandshahr. Local police are yet to solve the case. A few months later, the body of a 25-year-old woman was found dumped in a sack in Bulandshahr’s Gulaothi area.

Hyderabad: Members of auto and motor vehicle unions have raised concerns after the transport department’s proposal to hike the renewal fee of old vehicles as per Motor Vehicle Act 1988 has been put on hold by the state government for six months. The unions have said that the delay in hiking the renewal fee will allow vehicle owners to continue using old vehicles instead of scrapping them.

The RTA had sent a proposal to the government in August 2019 to increase the renewal fee of 15-year-old vehicles along with green tax and late fee to discourage vehicle owners from using old vehicles. “The decision to hike the fee is still pending with the state government,” said U Yadagiri, general secretary, Shakti Auto and Goods Drivers Unions.

Once the hike is implemented, renewal charges for cars will go up by 10 times. “While the existing fee for a four-wheeler is Rs 1,270, after the hike the amount will go up to Rs 10,000. This excludes green tax of Rs 535 and late fee of Rs 500 every month. Similarly, two-wheelers will have to pay Rs 2,000 instead of the existing Rs 600, apart from green tax of Rs 285 and late fee of Rs 300 every month,” said Sathi Reddy, auto union member. tnn

A 20-year-old British Sikh student has been murdered in Nottingham city centre.

Arjun Singh, a student at Nottingham Trent University, died on Sunday, 19 January, after being assaulted near the Slug and Lettuce pub in Long Row, in Nottingham city centre, just before 4am on Saturday night. The bar and restaurant, which opened in September 2019 following a £450,000 refurbishment, is open until 3am on Saturday nights.

Singh was rushed to the Queen's Medical Centre following the attack but died of his injuries on Sunday. Nottinghamshire Police have now launched a murder investigation.

Pete Knowles, who delivers newspapers in the area, told local newspaper, The Nottingham Post , that he saw the ambulance speed off as he was doing his newspaper delivery.

“All I saw was someone on the floor with a blue blanket over them. There were two ambulances that came and then police cars,” said Knowles.

The area was cordoned off all day on Sunday as crime scene investigators searched for evidence. “A team of detectives are working hard to establish the circumstances. Police are eager to trace two men who fled the scene on foot following the incident,” a police spokesman said.

""This was a serious assault which has resulted in a young man losing his life,” added Detective Inspector Richard Monk.

“Our thoughts with Arjun's family and friends and we would ask that people respect their privacy at this very sad and difficult time. We need to hear from anyone who may have dash-cam footage, including taxi-drivers who were in the area of Long Row West and Angel Row at the time, or any mobile phone footage of the incident. It is really important that if anyone has any information that could help the enquiry, no matter how small it may be, they come forward immediately,” Monk added.

Friends told TOI that Singh’s family was completely distraught.

Students from the Nottingham Trent University Sikh Society and the University of Nottingham Sikh Society, as well as members of Sikh Youth UK and the GAD Gym at Guru Arjan Dev Ji Gurdwara Derby, will hold a vigil at 5pm on Wednesday at the spot where the attack happened.

124,['20/01/2020'],CPM to hold nationwide campaign against NPR,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: CPM would hold a countrywide boycott campaign against the proposed National Population Register ( NPR ) by asking people not to respond to questions that could lead to the preparation of the registry, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury said here on Sunday.

“These enumerators will have two sets of questions. One for census and the other NPR. People are free to choose not to reveal NPR questions. There is nothing illegal in doing so. Such refusal doesn’t entail any legal action. Rather it would push the government to a tight spot,” he said in a news conference at the AKG Centre here. While the questions relating to census may be answered, the questions related to the NPR must not be. Census-Yes. NPR-No, would be our motto, Yechury said.

The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) was part of a grand design leading to NPR and NRC and hence the party central committee which concluded here on Sunday asked the central government to repeal the law that targets minority communities, especially Muslims, he said.

The party, Yechury said, would continue to give all support to the anti-CAA agitations springing up in various corners in the country. But it would not lead the agitation from the front. “Given the multitude of people who assemble in the fight against CAA, it’s better no single political party try to appropriate the agitation. Let the protest continue like this. We would lend them all support they need,” Yechury told reporters.

The central committee demanded of the Centre to withdraw the directions given to state governments to construct detention centres.

The committee, said Yechury, expressed strong disapproval of the statement made by the chief of defence staff, Gen Bipin Rawat that “de-radicalization” camps were needed for people, including young children who are being radicalized, particularly in Kashmir.

PUNE: A 44-year-old woman was duped of over Rs8 lakh by a man with whom she chatted for over two months after his introduction as a United Kingdom resident on a matrimonial website.

The woman transferred the amount between August 13 and 19, 2019, for paying custom fee for a gift the man, who she though her would-be groom, had sent from the UK. She had approached the cyber police in September and lodged a complaint with the Uttamnagar police on Saturday.

The woman had set up a profile for herself on a matrimonial website in 2017. In June last year, a man sent her a text message, saying that he liked her profile. The two decided to tie the knot in October, 2019. In August, the suspect told her that he would be sending her ‘Shagun’,” senior inspector of Uttamnagar police Sunil Pandhakar said.

“On August 13, the woman received a call from a man identifying himself as Raj Sharma — a customs officer from Delhi airport — and told her to pay Rs45,000 as customs duty for her ‘Shagun’ parcel. Over next three days, the woman transferred additional Rs5.55 lakh to him. “On August 19, the woman’s ‘would-be groom’ told her that he was in Scotland and his debit card was not working. He asked her to transfer Rs2 lakh and the woman obliged,” he said.

She, however, became suspicious when a woman posing as an Reserve Bank of India official demanded Rs3.2 lakh as fee for transferring the money from the ‘Shagun’ parcel to her bank account. “The woman called her ‘would-be groom’. When he insisted on paying the fee, she became suspicious,” he added.

Ahmedabad: That morning breathlessness after a short jog is not just the age - your heart could be giving you signals to slow down if there are symptoms like chest pain, giddiness and swelling in legs.

City-based cardiac experts point out that they record more cases of heart failure — the condition where the heart is not able to pump adequate blood across the body — during winter months. The doctors thus caution more care for existing cardiac patients.

Dr Sunil Thanvi, a city-based cardiologist, said that cardiac issues rise by about 20-35% during winter months compared to other times of the year. “The blood vessels get constricted in the cold, prompting a rise in blood pressure and heart rate. Rich food in winter is another reason. In earlier times, people were physically active enough to easily digest those adadiya with ghee but today it’s adding to the risk for those who already have cardiac condition,” he said.

This year’s winter was different with a sharp rise and fall in minimum temperature. Has that affected the pattern of cardiac cases? City-based experts said that there is rise in heart failure cases compared to heart attacks.

Dr Jayesh Prajapati, head of cardiology department at UN Mehta Institute of Cardiology & Research Centre, said that winter is marked by complaints of coronary spasms and complications such as acute coronary syndrome.

Hyderabad: The Advanced Vehicle Inspection and Fitness Centre, being constructed at Dandu Malkapur between Hyderabad and Yadadri-Bhongir, is stuck in a legal limbo. After hitting several roadblocks in the past nine years, the high court has ordered that work be stalled until further orders, as some people are claiming that the land belongs to a mining company.

“Earlier, no contractor was willing to come forward and take up works, as part of the land on which the testing centre was being constructed was under conflict. The transport department’s plans to inaugurate the centre in May last year also failed, even though tenders to finish work were called twice. And now, there is a stay order from the high court after some people claimed that the land belonged to a mining company,” said M Dayanand, general secretary, Telangana State Auto and Motor Welfare Association.

The one-of-its-kind facility can test over 300 vehicles daily — trucks, RTC buses, auto-rickshaws, school and college buses, cabs and goods carries — and enable them obtain computerised fitness certificates. It is being constructed by the transport department to eliminate human interference and curb corruption and other illegal practices during vehicle fitness checks.

Regional Transport Authority (RTA) officials said that they were just one step away from starting operations at the Advanced Vehicle Inspection and Fitness Centre. “Almost all the work required to commence the centre is complete. Allegations stating that the land belongs to a mining company are not true. We will inaugurate the centre once the stay order is lifted,” said C Ramesh, joint transport commissioner, RTA.

SECUNDERABAD: Twenty years after his retirement from the Army in 1990, Major General Ananta Bhanu Gorthi is happy with how he discharged duties in a role that required him to be fair and just.

When he joined the Indian Military Academy in 1956, the 23-year-old from Parvathipuram in Andhra Pradesh, was advised to be part of the Judge Advocate General (JAG) department due to his law background. A Judge Advocate General provides legal advice in court martial cases.

“You are a born marksman,” he was told when he shot bang on the target during his NCC days in college. And this held true throughout his army life. But more than the weapon, his career in the army was about ensuring that law was followed and not allowing it to be misused. Judge Advocate General advises the jury on decisions it should take on individual court martial cases.

The Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI) had bust a spy racket involving Indian Army officers and men working for the Pakistan Army in 1978. It was Gorthi who pointed out that under Section 18 of the Army Act, the President had powers to terminate their services. Those involved in the spy case denied their role but based on the evidence that had been gathered, they were terminated. The Supreme Court also upheld it.

Gorthi also played an instrumental role in a case related to Operation Blue Star. After the Sikh mutiny in the Indian Army was put down, authorities were contemplating on what should be done with the mutineers.

Gorthi who had risen to become the deputy Judge Advocate General at the headquarters in Delhi, analysed the situation and said those who first misled more than 900 Sikh soldiers had to be identified.

“In the Army, one obeys commands. So it was possible that many just obeyed and joined the mutiny, perhaps not even realising the enormity of the situation,” the 86-year-old told TOI at his residence at Sainikpuri.

Nearly 80 ‘ring leaders’ were separated and given a prison term and terminated. The rest of the soldiers were removed from their parent unit and dispersed into the others after making them realise their mistake. “There was one most important thing that we had to understand. The soldiers were men who were fit and could use weapons. By terminating them, there was a possibility of them turning into terrorists, as they knew how to fire. The issue had to be sensitively handled,” he recalled.

After being appointed the Judge Advocate General, AB Gorthi founded the Institute of Military Law at Kamptee near Nagpur in Maharashtra.

After his retirement from the army, he also served for five years as a member of the Central Administrative Tribunal. Now, at 86, AB Gorthi, does what he loves doing most — swimming and playing golf.

CHENNAI: In 2017, it took a week-long, massive — but a leaderless — protest on the Marina promenade to bring jallikattu back from a ban. Now over-enthusiasm to conduct the sport everywhere is threatening to kill it, again.Since the beginning of the Tamil month of Thai on January 15, at least 25 jallikattu events have been conducted in different villages in Tamil Nadu, including the season’s biggest draws at Alanganallur and Palamedu. At each event anywhere between 350 and 700 bulls were made to participate. The Alanganallur jallikattu had to be extended by another 30 minutes to ensure that all registered bulls had their run. The final count was 739. At Vadamayilapur in Pudukottai, nearly 850 bulls were pushed in on Saturday.Lining up 700-800 bulls for a single event is pure avarice. Stretching jallikkattu till the hot months of April and May is invitation for another ban.At jallikattu, a bull gets to run only 50m, and it is over in a couple of minutes. But before it exits the vaadivasal like lightning, the animal is made to stand in queues, at times for more than eight hours. They eat and drink little, but pee and poop more, all the while waiting inside narrow enclosures.Organisers of jallikattu events should never forget the reasons cited by the Supreme Court to ban the event in 2014.Keeping the ‘species’ best interest’ at the centre, the Supreme Court pointedly referred to Sections 3 and 11 of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (PCA) Act, and said, ""they confer no right on the organisers of jallikattu or bullock-cart race, but only duties, responsibilities and obligations, but confer corresponding rights on animals."" Citing Article 51A(g) of the Constitution, the court said it cast fundamental duties on every citizen to have ""compassion for living creatures"".Bulls cannot carry the so-called performance without being exhausted, injured, tortured or humiliated. Bulls are also intentionally subjected to fear, injury — both mentally and physically — and put through unnecessary stress and strain for human pleasure and enjoyment, it said.The PCA Act draws inspiration from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) guidelines and lists as non-negotiable the animals’ right to freedom from hunger, thirst and malnutrition; freedom from fear and distress; and freedom from physical discomfort. A bull made to stand for hours in the holding area, ahead of its run, and a bull that is driven across the state and made to participate in events well after Pongal, is squarely covered by these freedoms.Instead of risking another ban on jallikattu by falling foul of court rulings, organisers should do at least three things this season. One, the number of participating bulls should be limited to only a couple of hundred. It would also give breathing time for tamers and organisers to take good care of the animals. Two, there shall be statewide registry of jallikattu bulls, and a cap on the number of events a registered bull can participate in a year. Jallikattu events featuring unregistered bulls should be declared illegal and violators should be punished. Three, jallikattu shows should be over by February-end, and not extend till the summer months. Stringent curbs on jallikattu being organised at non-traditional locations and temples can ensure the number of events is limited.An overkill of jallikattu and the resultant fatigue of participating bulls, and safety risk to people due to events in non-traditional ill-equipped venues is a perfect recipe for embargoing the sport. If organisers refuse to wake up to this, the state government must put its foot down and do the needful to save the tradition, sport, bulls and people — all in one stroke.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73415027,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1046708,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/why-its-important-to-fix-the-safety-latch-in-the-bull-run/articleshow/73395605.cms

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: Cops in Gandhinagar fell in a catch-22 situation when a state government employee approached them with a complaint that the 26-year-old woman class teacher of his 14-year-old son had gone missing taking his son in tow. The man, who works at Udyog Bhavan in Gandhinagar said the woman had seduced his teenage son, who studies in class VIII and taken him away with her. The boy had gone missing from 4pm on Friday, and the classteacher was also missing.

A police official said the woman teacher had been too intimate with the allegedly missing boy for around a year, and the school authorities had recently rebuked them. “As their relationship was unaccepted, they left their homes on Friday,” he said. It was rare to find a case of a woman teacher eloping with her teenage student, the official added.

An FIR for elopement under Section 363 IPC has been registered with Kalol city police in Gandhinagar district . The complaint stated the teacher is a resident of Darbari chawl in Kalol town.

“When I reached home at around 7pm, I found my son missing. My wife told me he had left home at around 4pm. We searched for him in the neighbourhood and among relatives, but couldn’t trace him,” claims the teenage boy’s father in the FIR. “I went to the teacher’s house but they were not there,” the man stated.

Inspector K K Desai of Kalol city police said the missing duo could not be traced as they were not carrying cellphones.

PUNE: A 56-year-old pillion rider was killed after she fell off the motorcycle and was run over by a speeding car on the road towards Akurdi railway station in Nigdi Pradhikaran on Saturday evening.

The Nigdi police have identified the deceased woman as Saraswati Suresh Shinde of More Vasti in Chikhali. Shinde’s son, Ganesh (37), has lodged an FIR with the police.

The police said Ganesh and his mother were driving towards Akurdi railway station on their motorcycle.

He said the driver of a four-wheeler, just behind them, was not able to halt in time and the car’s wheel ran over Saraswati Shinde’s head, killing her on spot. Her son escaped with minor injuries.

Ganesh Shinde was not able to note the vehicle’s registration number. “We have started collecting CCTV footage to identify the car,” the officer said.

Mechanical engineer killed in accident

Representative image

PUNE: The Kolhapur police on Sunday arrested three people for allegedly selling fake question papers of the Common Entrance Exam for recruitment into the Indian Army on Sunday.

The action was taken jointly by the Southern Command’s military intelligence liaison unit, the Pune cybercrime cell, and the Kolhapur crime branch in the early hours of Sunday. The suspects have been booked under IPC sections 420 and 34.

Police said the question papers recovered did not match the originals and so, the recruitment exam was held as scheduled on Sunday.

The suspects are residents of Satara and Kolhapur — one of them runs a private training centre in Satara. Police said the suspects sold the fake question papers to 19 aspirants.

The action was taken after Saurabh Kurane of Kolhapur lodged an FIR with the Rajarampuri police station.

“The suspects had taken money from the 19 aspirants under the pretext of helping them sail through the recruitment exam. We have recovered fake question papers from their possession,” Kolhapur superintendent of police Abhinav Deshmukh told TOI over the phone on Sunday.

About 1,800 candidates had appeared for the examination — for all trades — at 109 Territorial Army ground in Kolhapur.

“We strongly suspect the owner of the academy has duped many others in a similar fashion. We will look into this and also verify how many others were involved,” Deshmukh said.

Over 100 private academies, mostly run by ex-servicemen, operate in Western Maharashtra. “Youths in this region are keen on joining the Armed Forces and join these academies. The operators charge each aspirant Rs3-5 lakh, claiming to provide the CEE question paper, assistance in clearing the medical, etc,” said a senior Satara police officer, who investigated a similar case in 2018, said.

PUNE: The state education department has extended the deadline — for students excelling in classical art, drawing and participation in folk art — to claim extra marks in board examinations from January 15 to February 15 .

The department had issued a government resolution on November 24, 2019, stating that eligible students must submit their proposals by January 15. Now, students can submit their proposals by February 15, while schools must forward them to the divisional board by February 25, said Ashok Bhosale, secretary, Maharashtra State Board Of Secondary And Higher Secondary Education.

In 2016, the education department had reintroduced bonus marks for extracurricular activities for students participating in sports, art, culture, etc. Many students have since scored a perfect 100.

For instance, for students excelling in drawing, 5-15 marks are awarded on the basis of grades in intermediate drawing exams.

136,['20/01/2020'],Future plans: Ahmedabad's CG Road to get underground parking,"AMC official said more than 100 cars and double the number of two-wheelers will be parked

AHMEDABAD: Even as the planners are on the verge of giving their finishing touches to the now re-imagined boulevard, CG Road , a concern for future parking needs has led them to make provisions for underground parking lots. The nature of the parking lots — mechanised or with a ramp — is yet to be decided.Right now, close to 15,000 people are employed with various establishments on the road. Prior to the revamp, there was on-street parking space for roughly 425 cars and 840 two-wheelers according to Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) estate department officials, which included employees’ parking too. This time, only visitors’ parking for 338 cars and 446 two-wheelers has been provisioned, while the establishments have been left to manage employees’ parking in the basements or hire space at Navrangpura multi-level parking. A copy of the detailed plan with TOI shows provisions for underground parking facility and large space below it for the metrorail. The idea of the street width is inspired by Regent Street, London, or Orchard Road, Singapore. When asked for the capacity of the underground parking facility, an AMC official said more than 100 cars and double the number of two-wheelers will be parked.It was in 2013 that the AMC had first proposed an underground parking lot along with a multilevel parking in the space where the municipal market stands today. “The SPV for undertaking development works on CG Road will be assigned with private stakeholders as partners in the construction of these parking lots,” said the estate department official.The locations of the underground parking lots are yet to be finalised added the AMC official. “The idea is to have no front or side setbacks. Better pedestrian space means better frontage to shops. Footpaths will become meaningful meeting spaces,” he added.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73407131,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-246129,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/future-plans-cg-road-to-get-underground-parking/articleshow/73395905.cms

TIRUPUR: The district Prohibition Enforcement Wing (PEW) police have seized more than 16,000 litres of rectified spirit from a farmhouse near Cheyur in Avinashi taluk based on the intelligence inputs from the Kerala police.

According to an official source, Central Investigation Unit (CIU) officials from Salem and Tirupur PEW police conducted a raid at the farmhouse in Chinnakanur on Saturday based on a tip from the Kerala police that the house was being used to store rectified spirit.

“The Kerala police had a few days ago seized around 3,000 liters of rectified spirit near Chalakudy in Thrissur district. The accused told them that the spirit was taken from Cheyur,” the source said.

During the search, the team recovered 16,000 litres of rectified spirit and booked two people - farm house owner S Ganesan, of Annur in Coimbatore district , and his tenant Jagan alias Janarthanan, 57, of Alathur, in Palakkad district.

The source said Janarthanan was running a bakery in Annur. “He told Ganesan that he was involved in vegetable and fertilizer trading and rented the house to be used as a godown. The team seized 434 cans, each with 35-litre capacity, of rectified spirit from the house.”

While the team has arrested Ganesan, Janarthanan is on the run.

K Gunasekaran, additional superintendent of police, Tirupur PEW, said Janarthanan was already facing two cases for smuggling spirit into Avinashi in 2012. “Usually, spirit is smuggled into Kerala from northern states. It is either mixed with toddy or used to make alcohol. Due to tightened vigil, the smugglers transport the spirit in the guise of daily commodities and store it in Tamil Nadu districts bordering Kerala. It would then be taken to Kerala in small quantities.”

PUNE: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to strictly adhere to the tree plantation, re-plantation and cutting plan as mentioned in an inspection report furnished by an expert panel to facilitate a road widening project between Cummins College and Mahalaxmi Lawns in Karvenagar.Papillon Condominium, a society near Maharshi Karve Stree Shikshan Sanstha (MKSSS), had filed an application against the PMC’s move to cut 250 century-old trees along this stretch for road widening, without having a proper plan. It claimed the authorities were not serious about exploring options like an apt transplantation plan or freeing up the road stretch of encroachments to create space and avoid tree felling.The society pointed out that a significant number of these trees belong to the MKSSS and many of them were planted by its founder and great social reformer Maharshi Dhondo Keshav Karve.The felling of the trees would cause an irreparable loss to a vital green lung of the city, the society complained. The NGT had then assigned an expert panel, comprising members of the Tree Authority and the PMC, among others, for inspecting the site and submitting a report.In its report to the green tribunal, the panel stated, “..... inspection is carried out in accordance with the permission granted for cutting of 88 trees and replanting 162 trees at Mahalaxmi Lawns (Panand Road) 15mts DP Road, Karvenagar, Pune and planting 750 trees in lieu thereof and in view of interest of citizens, a report is hereby given that development of 15mts road is required with immediate effect by completing the process of tree plantation, tree replantation and tree cutting etc.”The NGT bench of Justice S P Wangdi and expert member Siddhanta Das disposed of the matter by stating in an order on January 16 (Thursday), “Considering the facts and circumstances in the report, we do not find any reason as to why we should not accept it. ....

Thiruvananthapuram: The CPM politburo (PB), which on Sunday prepared a long reply to the issues that came up in the three-day session of the central committee (CC), conveniently ignored the criticism against the arrest of two CPM workers in Kozhikode by the state police under UAPA charges.

The arrest of Allan Shuhaib and Thwaha Fazal and subsequent NIA probe was raised in the committee by a few members who are learned to have told about the complaints they received against the Pinarayi Vijayan government’s handling of the case. Though there were not many takers for the issue in the committee, the CC members expected a reply to the criticism levelled by the members from party general secretary Sitaram Yechury during the latter’s reply for the debate. However, Yechury didn’t touch upon the issue.

Sources in the CPM said that the PB meeting held in the morning decided not to respond to the issue as that would shift focus from the major agenda of massive protests being planned against the Centre. In fact, nobody in the PB wanted to offend CM Pinarayi Vijayan, who had been the host of this edition of CC meeting. With the NIA taking over the probe, party intervention would have no impact on the case either.

Later in the day, while addressing a news conference, Yechury claimed that the party’s position still is against UAPA, which is particularly draconian in nature. “It puts the onus on the accused to prove his innocence. But since the law is on the roll, there is no option but to obey,” Yechury said.

He said he was aware of the arrest of youths under the UAPA but insisted that the state government has little role in dealing with such cases. He added that the actions of state police need not to be analogous to CPMs policies. “Police are supposed to go by the law, not party policy,” he said.

Hyderabad: Ahead of the municipal corporation elections, Boduppal residents also raised concerns over mushrooming of liquor stores in the vicinity of residential areas.

According to residents, five liquor stores have been set up on a one-kilometer stretch ahead of the Boduppal Ambedkar Statue towards Hema Nagar.

Three months go, a massive protest was held by the residents seeking removal of the liquor stores being operated near a hospital and school. “A liquor store has been constructed illegally on a nala. Over the past few months, two new shops have been set up on the same stretch. A large number of people consume liquor on the road,” said a resident.

The issue plagues many colonies such as Veera Reddy Nagar Colony, Buddha Nagar Colony and Annapurna Colony. While multiple representations have been submitted by to the Boduppal Municipal Corporation, residents claim that little action has been initiated to shift or remove these liquor stores from residential areas. “@Rachakonda_tfc In Boduppal, in 1 sq km area, there are five wine shops/bar & restaurants.

Nagpur: As Nagpur district witnessed 4.87 lakh traffic violations, the three regional transport offices in the district have suspended 2,895 driving licences for upto six months across Nagpur district for serious traffic offences like overspeeding, drunken driving, jumping signals and using mobile phones while driving in 2019. It translates to only 0.59% violators losing their licence.

With support from regional transport offices in the district, Nagpur city and rural traffic police have decided to come down heavily on repeat offenders, particularly for drunken driving, signal jumping, overspeeding and using mobile phone while driving.

According to data obtained from city, deputy east and rural regional transport offices, City RTO Dinkar Manwar’s office suspended highest number of licences at 1,512 for various offences. Rural RTO Shripand Wadekar’s office suspended 761 driving licences while east office headed by deputy RTO Vinod Jadhav suspended 622 licences.

Last year, both city and rural traffic police issued 4,87,530 challans for various violations. Over 22,484 motorists were challaned for drunk-driving and 44,075 for signal-jumping, while 21,566 penalised for using mobile phones while driving.

All three transport offices suspended 1,702 driving licences of drivers/riders caught for drunk driving, while 374 motorists faced suspension for signal jumping. As many as 275 and 120 motorists faced similar actions for using mobile phones while driving and overspeeding.

“These are serious offences and risk lives of fellow motorists. We started forwarding driving licences of motorists repeating these violations to RTOs for suspension. We want to send strong message that breaking laws won’t be tolerated,” said a senior cop from the office of deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Chinmay Pandit. As all e-challans are digitally stored, tracking down repeat offenders has become easy for police now.

Traffic activists stressed the need for round the clock drives against speeding, drunk driving, riding without helmets, using mobile phones while driving, signal-jumping and lane-cutting. “We must discipline motorists, as in most accidents, human error is the cause,” they said.

DEHRADUN: There will be 11 students from Uttarakhand present at Talkatora Stadium in New Delhi on Monday, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address students from across India before their board exams. The state education department has issued guidelines to all chief education officers to ensure all schools play the live telecast of the programme.

Mukul Kumar Sati, state additional project director (education) told TOI orders were issued to chief education officers of all 13 districts in the state to make arrangements for live telecast of the PM’s address.

“We want students of Class IX-XII to watch the live telecast of the programme. The expenditure incurred to make arrangements for the live telecast will be borne by the district level head of the education department,” said Sati, adding the live telecast will be shown in 2,317 government inter-colleges and schools affiliated with the state board.

The state has around 23,000 schools. Even Central Board of Secondary Education and other boards have issued similar guidelines to schools following their curriculum.

In Uttarakhand, schools have been ordered to show the live telecast on computer screens, TVs or projectors, whichever is available. Around 500 schools in the state, which have virtual classes, will show the same via live session organised by the education department.

“Schools which can’t make these arrangements have been ordered to use transistors,” said the official, adding that Uttarakhand education minister Arvind Pandey will follow the speech at a school in US Nagar, as the Union HRD ministry has asked education ministers of all states to participate in the programme by attending any school.

“Education minister Arvind Pandey will follow the ‘ Exam pe Charcha ’ event with 2,000 students at Udayraj Hindu inter-college in Kashipur,” he added.

145,['20/01/2020'],City zoo: Corporation gets last chance to comply with CZA guidelines,"This story is from January 20, 2020

COIMBATORE: A year after dereognising the VOC Park mini zoo in the city, the central zoo authority (CZA) has given the city corporation a chance to comply with its guidelines by submitting a detailed project report (DPR) before May 31.

CZA has also directed the corporation to update the project developments regularly and warned of stern action if it fails to comply with the norms, said a source familiar with the development.

The directions were passed during the recent meeting held in New Delhi after the civic body informed that it had acquired 29 acres for expanding the zoo.

The central government body has been directing the corporation to submit a detailed layout of the proposed site for zoo relocation and the year-wise plan of shifting the animals since 2007 after it was identified that the zoo was functioning in a very small space.

“But till date, the corporation has not taken any productive step to address the space crunch. It has only enhanced the suffering of the animals, birds and reptiles caged there. CZA had refused to renew the recognition to the zoo several times. But the corporation did nothing and sought more time to prepare the report,” said the source.

The source said that CZA had renewed the recognition twice – once in 2011 for two years and in 2016 for a year – giving a chance for the corporation to comply with the norms. As the corporation failed to follow its directions, CZA refused to grant recognition until the guidelines were met and taking it a step further, cancelled the recognition in November 2018.

As many as 34 violations pertaining to animal housing, display of animals and animal enclosures, veterinary and infrastructure facilities, acquisition and breeding of animals, healthcare of the animals, and visitors’ facilities were recorded, according to the report submitted by CZA’s technical committee. The report stated that some of the violations were recorded in 1996.

“Even though a year has passed since the violations were pointed out and the recognition was cancelled, the corporation has not corrected them,” the source added.

Meanwhile, a corporation official told TOI that the civic body has decided to develop the zoo on the prison campus land it owns and upgrade it under the smart city mission.

But city-based activists flayed the civic body for delaying the work, saying that it shows a lack of interest and proper guidance. “A lot of students and animal enthusiasts visit the zoo to learn more about the animals. If the corporation further delays the project, the chances are high that CZA might permanently close the facility. So, the corporation should speed up the process or they should hand it over to the forest department, which can run it efficiently,” said Ni Jalaludin, president of the Nature Conservative Society.

147,['20/01/2020'],NIMS doctor dies of cardiac arrest in London,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Dr AK Meena

HYDERABAD: A senior neurologist from Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS), Dr AK Meena, suffered a massive cardiac arrest while speaking at the Neurology Conference in London on Thursday. The 54-year-old doctor was given cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) immediately after she collapsed and was rushed to St Bartholomew’s Hospital. She was kept on ventilator support and later declared brain dead on Friday.

In another incident, a 36-year-old gynaecologist, Satya Ramana, collapsed after completing a surgery in Nalgonda on Friday and succumbed.

The two incidents were reported within a span of 24 hours, raising questions about the health condition of doctors, which experts say is often ignored. Previous studies have shown that a major cause of death of doctors is cardiac arrest, followed by brain stroke and suicide. In both these cases, the sudden event is believed to have been triggered by stress and ignoring crucial symptoms.

“In the case of Dr Meena, the ischemic attack is possible only when there are existing clots. There have been previous cases of sudden collapse. In all those cases, stress has been a major factor. Apart from that, factors like doctors being blamed if anything goes wrong after a surgery also weighs on their mind. Commercialisation and corporatisation of hospitals and inadequate communication with patients add to the problem,” said Dr Sanjeev Singh Yadav, secretary general, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Telangana .

Many studies suggest that doctors tend to ignore their symptoms. A study by IMA showed that doctors died much earlier than an average citizen. While an average person lived up to 72 years, doctors lived up to 59 years on an average. The study had concluded that doctors died earlier because they neglected their health.

“Doctors work under very high levels of stress and often ignore their own health. Most doctors, in fact, die younger due to cardiac arrest,” said Dr Ashish Chauhan, preventive medicine expert, adding that the family and spouse of doctors have an important role in reducing their stress.

PUNE: Nearly two months registering a case against the managing director, director and staff of Goodwin Jewellers’ Bund Garden Road outlet, the Pune and Thane police have jointly searched the premises, only to recover just imitation jewellery and silver ornaments.

The search was conducted on Thursday. The Koregaon Park police had sealed the shop on November 6, 2019, after booked Goodwin MD Sunil Kumar, his brother — and director — Sudheer Kumar, and some local staffers under the charges of cheating and criminal breach of trust. The matter was handed over to the economic offences wing (EOW), which has since received 380 complaint applications from people across the city, who had invested in the jewellery firm’s investment and fixed deposit schemes.

The city police’s action came after the Thane police registered a similar case. “As of now, the Kumar brothers have been remanded in the custody of the Navi Mumbai police in another cheating case,” ACP (EOW) Shivaji Pawar told TOI.

Thursday’s search operation yielded no genuine gold jewellery. “We seized imitation jewellery and some silver, totally worth Rs4,000,” Pawar said.

As many as nine complaints have been lodged with the Thane (rural), Thane (city), Palghar, Mumbai, Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad police. Nothing was found at the shop in Chinchwad either, police said.

Police told TOI that the jewellery from the shops was shifted months before the cases were registered. “We are trying to trace the ornaments,” Pawar said.

Coimbatore: Members of the National Federation of the Blind (NFB) are seeking promotions in reserved posts.

Blind people are getting promotions in reserved seats only sporadically and that too only after lengthy legal battles, NFB project director for south India P Manoharan said. “People with disabilities are given 4% reservation in government jobs, of which 1% is for blind people. The same applies for promotions also. But the majority of the people, who get government jobs through reservation, are not given promotions. According to the state government, reservation is only for the job and not promotions,” he said.

In addition to this, promotion exams for the blind people are not arranged easily with the excuse of unavailability of scribes, the official said. “NFB has been fighting for this legally.”

“There is no proper statistics from the state as to what is the actual number of blind people in reserved posts. According to statistics given by the state on the total number of government posts, there should be 2,500 blind people in reserved posts. But, as per our calculations, there are less than 1,000 people,” Manoharan said.

Sunanda Patnaik

BHUBANESWAR: Noted Indian classical singer Sunanda Patnaik , reverentially referred to as ‘Guruma’, passed away in Kolkata’s Salt Lake on Sunday. She was 85.

Sunanda, the daughter of poet Baikunthanath Patnaik, was born in Cuttack and began her singing career with All India Radio at the tender age of 14. She was known for her high-pitched renditions and melodious voice.

Trained by Kundala Adi Narayana and later by Vinayak Rao Patwardhan of the Gwalior gharana in Pune, she received a master’s degree in music in 1956. She also received a scholarship in music from the country’s first President, Rajendra Prasad.

Sunanda was as adept at singing bhajans in Hindi and Odia as she was in pure classical. Her Jagannath bhajans — particularly ‘jeevana patra mo bharichha kete, mate’, which was written by her father — still remain popular in the state.

The Cuttack-born singer has received countless awards including the Odisha Sangeet Natak Akademi award in 1970 and 1971, the Indian Lifetime Achievement award in 2009 and the lifetime achievement award from the Orissa Society of the Americas in 2012. She also received the Sangeet Natak Akademi award (Tagore Akademi Puraskar) in 2012. A film on her life — ‘Nilamadhaba’ — produced by the Films Division received the national award for best documentary in 2011.

Governor Ganeshi Lal, chief minister Naveen Patnaik, union ministers Dharmendra Pradhan and Pratap Sarangi and state ministers Jyoti Prakash Panigrahi and Ashok Chandra Panda expressed grief at her passing.

“I am deeply saddened by the death of noted singer Sunanda Patnaik. Her place will always be special in the field of classical music. I heartfelt condolences with the bereaved family,” the chief minister tweeted.

Sunanda, a spinster, moved to Kolkata in 1983, where she launched a music institute, Vishnu Vinayak Sangeet Ashram, to teach Hindustani classical to students.

153,['20/01/2020'],One more airline stops service from Trivandrum International Airport,"This story is from January 20, 2020

<p>Trivandrum International Airport<br></p>

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Even as the development plans of the Trivandrum International Airport are yet to take off, one more airline has decided to withdraw its services from the airport.

Malindo Air, based in Kuala Lumpur, which operates three flights between Thiruvananthapuram and Kuala Lumpur, has stopped its reservation facility for the schedule beyond June 6.

Fly Dubai had suspended its operations from the airport and Saudia had shifted its operations to Kannur International Airport last year.

“The decision to withdraw services from Thiruvananthapuram is an internal matter. There are only three services from Thiruvananthapuram in a week, while there are daily services from Cochin International Airport. Demand is good from Thiruvananthapuram, but the airlines get more passengers from Kochi,” said a staff of Malindo Airlines.

The Airport Authority of India, which had decided to outsource the airport’s management operations last year is yet to complete the process. While, the bids were opened in February 2019, the awarding of tender got delayed after protests were raised against the privatization of the airport and cases were filed.

A group of airport users have begun an online petition requesting Malindo Airlines to not stop its services from Thiruvananthapuram.

“Hundreds of Indians and Malaysians of Indian origin with ties to Kerala and Tamil Nadu will be deprived of direct access since Thiruvananthapuram airport caters to the southern districts of these states. It will also impact tourism traffic from and to Thiruvananthapuram and Kuala Lumpur. Hundreds of regular passengers using the route, including senior citizens and young families, will now be forced to take alternative routes such as Chennai and Kochi,” states the petition.

Kollam MP N K Premachandran, who had taken up the matter of the privatisation of the airport with the central government, said there is a private lobby working behind the cancellation of flights from Trivandrum International Airport. “There is deliberate attempt to reduce the number of flight operations from Thiruvananthapuram and relocate these services to Kochi and Kannur. Trivandrum airport is profitable and major developments are proposed. The government filed a case before the high court against the tender for PPP development of the airport, which was a futile attempt after losing the bid. If the government had not filed the case, the tendering process would have been completed earlier,” he said.

“I am informed that the process is on but the government is held up with other matters,” said S N Raghuchandran Nair, chairman of Airport Users Consultative Committee.

According to an airport official at the operations wing, no official communication has been received from Malindo Airlines on the cancellation of services. “Presently, the airline is operating winter schedule. Airlines are likely to inform about change in services during summer three months before the schedule. We have not received any such communication,” said the official.

Indore: As part of plans to monitor and control supply of Narmada water through Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition ( SCADA ) system, Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) has now started trial of this system at nearly half a dozen overhead tanks. The list of these tanks includes overhead tanks of Ret Mandi, Chandan Nagar, Kila Maidan, Scheme 103 among others.

Narmada Project's superintendent engineer Sanjeev Shrivastava said that they have installed control valves and flow meters at these overhead tanks to record inlet and outlet supply of Narmada water, and their feed has also been linked with SCADA control and command centre to collect data on real time.

“We have started testing this system, which would take about a week or so. Once completed, this system which works on hydraulic modelling, would allow us to collect comprehensive data on flow of water in feeder and distribution pipelines,” he said, adding that supply of all these tank would be managed and operated from command and control centre.

He said that households that receive supply from these tanks are also being equipped with meters.

Shrivastava said that they are working on implementing the same system at around 200 centres, which includes 86 existing tanks, 27 new tanks, construction of which is underway, pump house at Mandaleshwar, Yeshwant Sagar, Bilawali Lake and Devdharam filter station.

He said that in total, they will be controlling water flow and collecting related data from about 200 locations.

“By January end, we will start collecting data from 40 overhead tanks and by end of February, we will have control and data collection system implemented at all these locations,” he said.

Officials said that this system will allow them to curb loss of water as well as revenue. “This will give us a fair idea about consumption and demand of water in each and every area of city. Besides, it will also allow us to control and regulate supply remotely,” they said.

156,['20/01/2020'],MSEDCL ups its price to woo solar power makers,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Nagpur: In view of the poor response to its tender for buying 1,350MW solar power, state discom MSEDCL has increased the maximum price to attract producers.

The company had floated tenders for buying 1,350MW with a cap of Rs3.15 per unit but got bids for only 5MW. Now it has increased the cap to Rs3.30 per unit and floated the tender again.

The developers will have to set up solar projects, including the transmission and distribution network, up to the delivery point at their own cost. It will also include acquiring necessary approvals, permits and clearances.

The projects would be selected regardless of the technology used in the solar modules and irrespective of whether they come with trackers or not.

The last date for bid submission is January 29, 2020, and both the technical and commercial bids will be opened on the same date.

All bidders must submit an earnest money deposit (EMD) of Rs1 lakh per MW of quoted bid capacity.

Meanwhile, MSEDCL has floated another tender for buying 500MW. The ceiling price for this tender is Rs2.9 per unit. When MSEDCL didn’t get a response at Rs3.15 per unit, how was it expecting bidders at Rs2.9 per unit?.

The poor response to its solar tenders bodes ill for MSEDCL. Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) has issued a draft policy announcing its renewable purchase obligation from 2020 to 2025. The solar targets mentioned in the policy draft will start at 4.5% in 2020-21 and go up to 13.5% over the next five years.

MSEDCL has protested stating that the commission’s proposal to revise the solar target to 13.5% by 2024-25 was quite stiff and that despite best efforts, it would not be able to achieve it. Total solar capacity of 12,500MW would be required by 2024-25 to achieve the target against the present capacity of 4,200MW. The competitive bidding process to expand the capacity takes a lot of time and there were many other factors beyond its control, the discom said.

While protesting the target, MSEDCL is doing its best to scuttle solar rooftop, which can help it in meeting the MERC target. The discom has proposed astronomical grid supply charge (GSC) on rooftop consumers, which will make solar unviable.

The illumination was supposed to be there since its opening. One part of Ram Jhula was inaugurated in December 2014 and second part in January 2019. But Mumbai based company building it, Afcons Infrastructure, installed and commissioned the lighting system only in August 2019.

MSRDC sources told TOI two ROBs were illuminated for all of 3 days in August. “Afcons appointed two city-based agencies for supplying and installing lighting system. 128 LED lights were installed on cables of two ROBs. An automatic programme with a panel was set up in a room below Ram Jhula at the cost of around Rs 70 lakh. Lighting can be programmed in 12 colour combinations. Life of lighting system is 40,000 hours. That means illumination will last 12 years if used for nine hours every night,” sources said.

MSRDC sources added Afcons was yet to release payment of two agencies. An MSRDC official told TOI Afcons was responsible for operation and maintenance of lighting system along with other works on Ram Jhula for five years of defect liability period (DLP). “We will ensure problem is resolved from MSEDCL side and its continuous operation by Afcons,” the official said.

Afcons spokesperson told TOI, “Afcons completed and handed over Ram Jhula to MSRDC in January 2019. The illumination work was thoroughly checked and approved by MSRDC and consultant RITES. We had informed MSDRC only single-phase power supply was available for lighting system as against need for three-phase supply. Therefore, lights were turned off as safety precaution. MSEDCL later informed Afcons the single-phase power supply was temporary as three-phase connection was hindered due to Metro Rail construction at Santra market.”

However, MSEDCL spokesperson denied there was any problem from MSEDCL side. “We have not received any application or complaint from MSRDC or Afcons about power supply of Ram Jhula. Streetlight on Ram Jhula is continuously in operation,” he said.

BJP corporator Dayashankar Tiwari said power supply cannot be a reason for keeping illumination off. “I receive regular complaints about no streetlight on Ram Jhula after 11pm. I talked to officials of MSRDC, NMC and MSEDCL and ensured streetlights were working throughout the night. Ram Jhula witnesses huge traffic all the time so special care is required for its maintenance,” he said.

Mangled remains of the SUV which crashed into a dumper killing five people on Sunday

RAJKOT: Eight persons , including an NRI couple , were killed in two separate accidents that happened within a span of just one hour on Limbdi-Ahmedabad highway early on Sunday morning.

In the first accident, five persons were killed when their SUV jumped the divider and crashed into a dumper coming from the opposite direction in the other lane of the highway. The accident happened near Devpara village of Limbdi taluka in Surendranagar district.

“It appears that the driver of the SUV dozed off while driving, following which the SUV lost control, jumped the divider and crashed into the dumper coming from the opposite direction in the other lane of the highway,” said Hitendrasinh Vala, head constable with Panshina police station.

The deceased identified as Bhavani Nagendra (42), Subramanyam Tambaram (52), his wife Rajeshri (49), Ganesh Subramanyam (22) and Akil Prasad (18) were from the same family. Five persons were also injured in the accident. Nagendra Prasad, a make-up artist with a Gujarati news channel in Ahmedabad, was taking his family members, who had come from Andhra Pradesh, on a pilgrimage to Somnath. Bhavani was his wife. The injured were taken to a private hospital in Ahmedabad.

The second accident was reported from near Mithapar village near Bagodara in Ahmedabad district where three persons were killed as their SUV rammed into the rear of a dumper just ahead of it.

“It appears that the driver of the ill-fated SUV could not spot the lights of the dumper and crashed into its rear,” said an official from Bagodara police station.

The deceased included two Kenya-based NRIs — Ketan Haria (55) and his wife Kundan (54). The driver of the SUV, identified as Hiren Doshi (49), was also killed in the accident. Ketan and his wife were natives of Machhuberaja village of Jamnagar’s Lalpur taluka. They had come here to attend some social function and were returning to Ahmedabad.

BENGALURU: Presuming that all residents of shantytowns in Kariyammana Agrahara and two other places in Bellandur were “illegal Bangladeshi immigrants”, BBMP on Sunday conducted a massive demolition drive and pushed at least 300 families to the streets. They included several people who had come to Bengaluru from flood-ravaged North Karnataka in search of a livelihood.BBMP officials confirmed 300 huts were demolished, which had come up on private properties. The eviction drive took the residents unawares. Scores of earthmovers arrived in front of their settlements in the morning when most had left for work. Only children, the infirm and the aged were there in many of the shanties, activists said.Parvathamma, who lived in one of the demolished huts, told TOI she is from a village in Kalaburagi district and came to Bengaluru three months ago. She said her family owned no land in the village and got no work on a regular basis, forcing her to move to Bengaluru with her husband and kids.Lekha Adavi, an advocate-activist, said, “It was an illegal drive; BBMP never consulted the dwellers. Did it conduct a survey to find out who was living in the area? There were residents of north Karnataka who had moved to the city after severe floods, and people from Bihar and West Bengal and other parts of the country. I am shocked how BBMP came to a conclusion that everyone were illegal Bangladesh immigrants.”A BBMP assistant executive engineer of Marathahalli sub-division had on Saturday written to police, saying the temporary sheds erected by illegal Bangladeshi nationals in Bellandur had to be removed and sought police protection. DCP (Whitefield) MN Anucheth said, “We got a requistion letter from BBMP to provide police protection and we gave it.”BBMP commissioner BH Anil Kumar appeared to be in the dark about the eviction drive and the correspondence between his officials and police. Kumar even claimed there was no such drive. “The Mahadevapura joint commissioner confirmed it to me; he is not allowed to conduct an eviction drive without bringing it to my notice. We are clear about it,” he said.Activists said no prior notice was given to residents before the evacuation drive. But police and BBMP officials on the spot claimed notice was given to the landowners and Bescom had cut off power connections, which were illegal in nature.On January 12, police and Mahadevapura corporators visited Kariyammana Agrahara to get details about undocumented Bangladeshi immigrants suspected to be living there. Mahadevapura MLA Arvind Limbavali had tweeted that some immigrants from Bangladesh had taken shelter in the locality and their sheds had become a haven for illegal activities. The MLA had said the authorities were instructed to act against the illegal settlement.In Video: Bengaluru: BBMP flattens 300 huts of ‘illegal Bangladeshi immigrants’",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73405853,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-737613,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/palike-flattens-300-huts-of-illegal-bangla-immigrants/articleshow/73395211.cms

I’m sure excellent players will come from this ground,” said Scindia, who is one of the patrons of Daly College.

A friendly cricket match was played between Daly College Board President XI and Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association XI. The 13-over match was won by Daly College Board President's XI. Senior Ranji players also participated in the match.

The match commenced with renowned cricket player and former headmaster of Daly College Vaman Jagtap ringing the huge brass bell at Scindia pavilion.

Thiruvananthapuram: CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan has come out against governor Arif Mohammad Khan for his confrontational approach towards the state government. The role of a governor is not to insult a democratically elected government of a state, the CPM state secretary said in an article written in the party mouthpiece.

“To get into the good books of the Centre and the BJP, the governor is using his office and powers to insult a state government. The governor forgets the fact the state is having a democratically elected government,” he said.

The comments made by the governor against the state government was quiet unwarranted and it could have been avoided. He is making a mockery of the constitutional bodies like state government and the assembly, Balakrishnan said in the article.

The agenda of the Sangh Parivar is to bring all the constitutional bodies under their fist. This unforeseen danger is being witnessed by the country and the constitutional posts like governors are being misused for this by the Centre, he added.

The Constitution of the country and the democracy itself are facing a threat. The country is witnessing massive protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The amendment has taken back the right to live in the country which has been ensured by our Constitution. The Sangh Parivar’s attempt is to communally divide the country, he said.

RAJKOT: Death of a 16-year-old girl in September last year , which was earlier reported to cops as suicide , has turned out to be a cold-blooded murder committed by her own father as he did not want her to pursue further studies.On Saturday, Prabhas Patan police in Gir-Somnath district arrested Maldev Solanki, who had allegedly poisoned his daughter Hiral to death in their native Inaj village of Veraval taluka on September 29.Solanki’s crime was exposed by the deceased’s sister Naina, a Class VIII student, who confided about the murder to her maternal uncle a few days ago.Police said Solanki forced pesticide down Hiral’s throat after beating her up with a wire. “Hiral, a Class XI student in Veraval Girls’ High School, wanted to study further. However, Maldev wanted to discontinue her studies. He used to often beat Hiral, her sister Naina and brothers — Dharmesh and Bhautik,” said G M Rathwa, inspector with Prabhas Patan police station.So fed up were Hiral, Naina and Dharmesh with the daily brutality that they consumed pesticide on September 14, However, all three survived due to timely hospitalization, Rathwa added.On September 29, Solanki again asked Hiral to drop out from the school.

He then picked up a bottle of pesticide and forced its content down Hiral’s throat.“Solanki threatened his family members that they would meet the same fate if they complained about the incident. He put Hiral to sleep in the bedroom.

Nagpur: Well-known painter Bijay Biswaal has managed to recover his social media handle which had been hijacked by a hacker from Turkey a couple of days ago. The handle, having almost 83,000 followers, had digital prints of several of his highly priced paintings worth lakhs of rupees.

Bijay tweeted that his team, comprising son Sneheel and wife Meghana, had managed to recover the handle following relentless follow-ups with the parent company and it’s executives. The recovery, though partial, brought relief to the Biswaals and also their numerous friends and followers across the globe. The ace painter, who has also tweeted his gratitude to city police chief BK Upadhyay and TOI, is now likely to take up the case with Nagpur police cyber cell, which his wife had already approached.

Sneheel said around 257 paintings, out of 800, have been recovered along with some sketches but more are expected to be regained. “We managed to regain control of the social media handle with the help of a friend in the parent company, who sent us a link with the option to reset the passwords. The hacker had already started posting paintings of my father pretending he was the creator, but then our move left him stunned. The hacker has started to now block followers,” he said.

City police cyber cell officer API Ashwini Jagtap said official letters have already been sent to various social media companies and their replies are awaited, which are likely to give more details about the hacker.

Nagpur: In a rare judgment, the state consumer disputes redressal commission (SCDRC) has directed the police department to arrest an unethical builder and present him before the jury before January 30.

The builder, who took an advance from three flat aspirants, did not develop the scheme and neither did he refund their money despite orders by SCDRC and assurance given to the national consumer disputes redressal commission (NCDRC).

The SCDRC registrar (legal), through three letters issued to the commissioner of police BK Upadhyay on January 7, said, “Please find the bailable warrant of arrest of Suresh Burrewar, proprietor of Gruhlaxmi Construction and Land Developers arising out of the complaint decided on January 6, 2017. The bailable warrant of arrest be sent to the proper police station for execution. Return duly executed warrant on or before January 30 positively. Arrest Burrewar and produce him before SCDRC,” the letter said.

Advocate Arvind Waghmare, who represented the three complainants, Paresh Kukudkar, Milind Karmakar and Gattu Chakravarthy, all residents of Chandrapur, said, “SCDRC in its order dated January 6, 2017 had directed the builder to refund the advance amount with interest of 15% per annum, compensation of Rs5 lakh each towards loss sustained by complainants for not providing them residential flats with the sale deed, Rs1 lakh each for physical and metal harassment and Rs10,000 each for cost of complaint. The builder failed to comply with the orders. Later, the builder filed a petition in NCDRC where he agreed to pay all the outstanding amounts by October 2019. The builder is yet to fulfil his financial commitments. I pleaded before the SCDRC regarding the non-compliance of the orders following which SCDRC issued a bailable arrest warrant,” he said.

The order was passed by BA Shaikh, presiding member and Jayshree Yengal, member.

As per the details given in the petition, the builder had started taking advance for his proposed multistorey building — Gruhlaxmi Palace at Beltarodi. The three complainants had booked two flats each at Rs25 lakh per flat in 2013. Two complainants had paid an advance of Rs4 lakh each. The third one paid Rs2.75 lakh in 2013. An agreement was executed with the builder, but he did not start construction of the scheme.

On October 20, 2014, the three complainants sent a notice to the builder, but he did not respond. On November 3, 2016, all the three complainants filed a case with SCDRC. Waghmare said that till date, the builder has not begun construction of the scheme.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A joint inspection by police and corporation in shopping complexes and institutions, where parking spaces have been converted for other purposes, will begin on Monday. The inspection follows a decision taken at a traffic advisory committee meeting based on a note prepared by the corporation’s town-planning committee on parking violations in commercial establishments.

The corporation officials said 20 violations of major nature have been identified in wards under the main office, mainly on MG Road and Kowdiar-Kuravankonam road. The establishments, where private parking lots have been functional without mandatory licences will also come under the scanner.

Over the past few months, the engineering wing has been working on identifying parking violations in which spaces were altered and used either for storage or for other purposes. “We have done our ground work and it won’t be a random inspection. A timeframe will be given to the violators to clear the violations failing, after which their trade licence will be cancelled,” said Palayam Rajan, chairman of town-planning committee. The violators will be asked to furnish copies of original plan with allocated spaces for parking during the inspection. Unauthorised parking lots run by commercial institutions has always been a point of contention between corporation and shop owners.

Health and revenue officials will also take part in the inspection. The city corporation had passed a by-law for management of private parking lots. The by-law was passed by the corporation council in July 2018 in the wake of growing complaints about unauthorised collection of parking fee in private parking lots. As per the by law, parking fee as prescribed by city corporation shall be collected only for additional parking areas earmarked by the building owners.

A one-time registration fee of Rs 3,000 needs to be paid by the owners of private parking lots for one year, following which it has to be renewed.

Thankamma and Medical College station house officer inaugurate the renovated house at Plamoodu

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Officers of the Medical College Janamaithri police station recently came to the rescue of a 75-year-old woman who was living in her dilapidated residence near Amayizhanjan Canal at Thekkumoodu Bund Colony near Plamoodu.

The Medical College police station, under the limits of which her house is situated, took up the renovation. Station house officer inspector Jayakumar along with Thankamma reopened the doors of her renovated house here on Friday morning in the presence of sub-inspector Sreekanth R S, Janamaithri beat officer C Babu, officers and residence association representatives.

According to Medical College police station Janamaithri beat officer and sub-inspector C Babu, Thankamma, who has been living on her own for a long time near the canal, was a frequent visitor to the Janamaithri meetings held at the police station.

Thankamma used to earn a small amount by giving tuitions to lower primary students. She also had a welfare pension of Rs 1,000.

“Her damaged house had a leaking roof and she had mentioned this in one of the Janamaithri meetings. With the help of residents and associations, who supported us with physical labour and funds, we completed the renovation of her house at an expenditure of around Rs 50,000. As she lives in a narrow lane next to the canal, where it is impossible for vehicles carrying the construction materials, officers and residents had to carry all materials up to the house. It took us around two months to complete the project,” said C Babu .

Thiruvananthapuram: Questioning the relevance of the post of state governors , CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury here on Sunday said the country should once again discuss whether the post should be abolished or not.

“It’s time to think over again whether we do really need governors in states where democratically elected governments rule. The Indian Constitution affirms that India is a union of states. Where does the role of a governor, who is a representative of the President comes in this context? It’s again time for us to think aloud the matter,” Yechury told reporters, when asked on the ongoing tussle between Kerala governor Arif Mohammmad Khan and the state government.

The governors were the representatives of viceroy in the colonial era. “Why should we have governors in this modern democratic era. His service comes handy only when a democratically elected government has to be dismissed. But we don’t want the Centre to dismiss any democratic government. Then what relevance does this post hold?,” Yechury said.tnn

Actor Nana Patekar, who was in the city on Sunday, paid a courtesy visit to Union minister Nitin Gadkari’s hom... Read More

Nagpur: City MP and Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Sunday said he has set a target of Rs5lakh crore to invest in infrastructure projects as there was no dearth of money but only lack of courage among bureaucrats to make decisions.

He also said that the government is trying to formulate a policy to cut imports for a $5 trillion economy. Gadkari once again took potshots at bureaucrats, saying they shouldn’t get involved in projects but help industrialists instead.

Gadkari, who is minister for road transport, highways, shipping and MSME (micro, small and medium enterprises), was speaking at the inaugural function of city-based Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology’s (VNIT) diamond jubilee celebrations.

On January 18, Gadkari had said that the $5 trillion economy was difficult but not impossible and the PMO was holding daily meetings to discuss measures for improving the infrastructure, transport and other sectors. The comments on bureaucrats come in the wake of the terse remarks made in Delhi on January 13. “These people (bureaucrats) are insensitive. They can’t make decisions. They make incorrect DPRs, keep squatting on files and don’t even let others make decisions,” Gadkari had said in Delhi.

At VNIT, the highways minister mocked at the functioning of babus. “I have set a target of investing Rs5lakh crore in infrastructure this year. There is no shortage of funds, but the only thing missing is courage in government officials to make decisions,” he said.

“In the last five years, I have approved investments worth Rs17lakh crore. Just the other day, during our high level meeting, bureaucrats were saying, ‘We will do this, we will do that’. I told them ‘Why would you do this or that? If you had the capacity to do it then why would you become an IAS officer and work here. You could have been industrialists. It’s not your job’,” he said, without specifying the projects that were discussed.

“I told the IAS officers to help those who can do it and not to mess things up,” Gadkari added.

On the economy, Gadkari said, “The government is trying to formulate a policy to cut imports and increase exports to make a 5 trillion economy.”

He reiterated his stand regarding imports. “Despite having enough resources and technology of our own, our imports are worth billions of rupees. The government needs support from institutions like VNIT and LIT for research and development pertaining to raw materials available in Nagpur and Vidarbha. We have a big coal block, but we are still importing coal. While paper mills are being shut, newsprint is being imported,” he said.

Regarding VNIT’s request for funding, Gadkari said the institute has generous and capable alumni who are ready to raise a corpus for its development. “Shortfall of any kind will be taken care of by the government,” he told the administration.

178,['20/01/2020'],BDDS cops deprived of ‘risk allowance’,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Nagpur: Cops from the bomb detection and disposal squad (BDDS) are an unhappy lot as their risk allowance has been discontinued after revision of their salaries post the seventh pay commission in April 2019.

While some units like city and rural police have withdrawn the special allowance for the risk involved in their daily work, others like Amravati city have retained the old payment for the special squads along with the pay-scale of the sixth pay commission.

TOI has learnt that the special allowance for high-risk units like the state anti-terrorist squad (ATS) and state anti-naxal operations (ANO), too, has been discontinued following implementation of the seventh pay commission.

The ATS did not even get their salary arrears after the revised pay package was implemented. They have so far just got the hike since April last year.

Sources in the police department said the risk allowance for the BDDS units were started since 1994 through a state government resolution (GR). It was a decision hastened by the bomb blasts and riots in Mumbai in 1993.

The allowance continued even after the implementation of the sixth pay commission but discontinued after the seventh one came into force on the grounds that there is a clause stating that separate clarifications would be issued for special units like the BDDS, ATS and ANO.

Joint CP Ravindra Kadam justified the move. He said there is already a substantial hike in the salaries of the police personnel following the implementation of the seventh pay commission. “There is a reference made in the seventh pay commission for the revision of these special pay packages which is now up to the state government to decide the scale. The state police has already have made a representation to the state government regarding the issue. A reply is awaited,” he said.

Even if the unit allows special allowances, it would be objected to by the treasury. “The state department has to take a call,” he said.

According to a senior officer from Amravati, the top brass is being misled by administrative officials because of vested interests. “There is no expressed clause in the seventh pay commission stating that the special allowances would be required to be rolled back. The state had started it after issuing a GR and did not repeal it since then. If there is a high risk in a special assignment then where is the motivation to work for it when the rest are getting the same returns with no threats to their lives,” he said.

BHUBANESWAR: With tigress Sundari’s return to Madhya Pradesh (MP) hanging in the balance, the Madhya Pradesh wildlife wing has sought a report on her health from the state.

The forest department in the central Indian state has written to the state’s principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife), H S Upadhyay, seeking a report on Sundari’s current behaviour and health pattern.

“We have received a letter from MP’s forest department. We will respond to it shortly,” Upadhyay said. After getting the response, forest departments of both the states will take a joint decision about moving the tigress to Kanha Tiger Reserve .

Sundari, who is currently lodged in a small enclosure in Satkosia Tiger Reserve, was brought from Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve as part of the first inter-state tiger translocation project in the country.

In December last year, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) had written to chief secretary Asit Tripathy, asking him to initiate her return as she could not be kept in a small enclosure any longer.

“In the interests of tiger conservation, the translocation shall be withdrawn with immediate effect. The tiger translocation project at Satkosia shall remain suspended till the ground situation in the field improves as per our protocol,” the NTCA said in the letter. Though a month has passed since the NTCA had asked Odisha to move Sundari to MP, action in this regard is yet to be taken.

About 40 days after Sundari was brought from MP on June 29, 2018, she was released in the wild. But soon, she allegedly developed man-eating tendencies and killed two persons. She was then darted and brought to the enclosure again.

The NTCA had also said, “Pre-requisite conditions such as prey augmentation, creation of inviolate space, eco-development, capacity building of staff and enhancement of protection for the reintroduction of tigers in Satkosia couldn’t be achieved despite sufficient funds.”

Ahmedabad: State education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama recently visited Kuwait as part of ‘Study in Gujarat’ initiative. He was accompanied by senior bureaucrats and representatives of the state’s universities. The aim of the visit was to attract foreign students to the state universities.

But Gujarat University (GU), the state’s biggest public university, is facing flak because it lacks basic amenities for the very students the government aims to attract.

GU had admitted 127 foreign students in 2019-20 including 100 males. The students come from Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Fiji, Nepal, South Africa, Kenya, Sudan, and Uganda. They are pursuing courses such as journalism, BBA/MBA, BCA/MCA, and doctoral studies.

“I have been staying at the hostel for the past one and a half years,” said a student from Uganda who requested anonymity. “I have written to the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) and the Study Abroad Programme (SAP) of GU multiple times about issues such as access to clean drinking water and hygiene conditions on and around the hostel premises.”

Another student, from Sri Lanka, said that the hostel must have a functional kitchen for international students , as stipulated by ICCR norms. “But here, the kitchen is in a pathetic condition,” said the student.

Subhash Singh, the regional officer of the ICCR, said that the council has received multiple complaints about GU and has sent them to the university officials. He said that the university has been ‘positive’ in its approach.

Nirja Gupta, the international student advisor at the university, said the university has not received any complaint from foreign students over the past two months. “All amenities are in place and cleaning of the premises is also happening regularly,” she said.

Kolhapur: Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj’s memorial would inspire the future generations for equality, democracy, modernisation and development, said NCP supremo Sharad Pawar .

Pawar was speaking at a programme organised for inaugurating the Shahu Samadhi Sthal—the memorial of Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj—at Dasara chowk on Sunday. Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) has constructed the memorial at an estimated cost of Rs 6 crore. Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj wished to have his resting place constructed at Nursery Baug.

Addressing the gathering, Pawar said, “A number of kings and dynasties have ruled several parts of India over the ages but the country will always remember two great rulers. One is Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, who set up the Hindavi Swaraj with the help of Mawalas, and the second is Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj, who despite being a ruler, was a social reformer who worked for the betterment of the downtrodden. These two rulers are not only an inspiration to people in Maharashtra but also to citizens across the country. Even the Uttar Pradesh government has named one district after Shahu Maharaj.”

Narrating the decisions taken by Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj when he ruled the princely state of Kolhapur, Pawar said, “He was the first ruler in India to have reserved 50% of the government posts for backward classes. This indicates his vision for the welfare of the people in the lower rungs of society.”

“Besides being a social reformer, Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj also constructed a dam to improve irrigation in the region and started power production to set up industrial units in the princely state of Kolhapur,” said the NCP chief.

The programme was presided over by Shahu Chhatrapati, a descendent of the Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj. Addressing the gathering, Shahu Chhatrapati said, “Rajarshi Shahu was a great social reformer, who gave direction to the growth and development of our country. His thoughts on equality and democracy spread across the country during pre-Independence period. We expect that in today’s world, there will be many followers of Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj who will carry forward the ideals set by him.”

Revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat said, “Shahu Maharaj’s work has been inspiring people since the last 100 years and will continue to do so. He did not just stop at thinking about the reforms he wanted to see in the society but also ensured that the reforms were strictly implemented and followed. His thoughts and work will motivate the government to work for the betterment of the common man.”

TRICHY: The Trichy Corporation has obtained mandatory administrative and technical sanctions from a high-powered expert committee of the Smart Cities Mission programme for developing and beautifying a portion of the Cauvery river bank in the city.

The civic body will develop bathing ghats along the river banks pursuing traditional style of architecture at an estimated cost of Rs 2.94 crore.

Stating that there was a persistent demand from the locals to develop bathing ghats along the Cauvery river banks that separate Srirangam island from mainland Trichy, the corporation mooted a proposal to develop the ghats. A stretch between Thillainayagam bathing ghat and vacant space opposite to the Oyamari electric crematorium has been identified to develop bathing ghats for a 200m stretch as part of the riverfront development proposal.

The bathing ghats envisaged at making provision for locals to offer prayers during auspicious days such as Adi Perukku will be implemented in three separate packages, with each costing Rs 98 lakh. “Lighting arrangements will be provided in the stretch identified under the Cauvery riverfront development. Initially, bathing ghats shall be established. Further beautification proposals are yet to be drafted,” an official source with the corporation said.

The corporation will float a tender inviting contractors to launch the civil work within a month. “Construction work for bathing ghats will be completed within six months of launching the civil work,” the official added. Unlike the Uyyakondan canal riverfront development project which is under way at Rs 17.56 crore as part of the smart cities mission aimed at establishing public parks, walking tracks and recreational zones, the civic body said that Cauvery proposal will be plain as far as the amenities are concerned.

Traffic snarls near Palpannai junction in Trichy

TRICHY: Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority ( UMTA ), a statutory autonomous body to create a sustainable urban transport system by involving various stakeholders, proposed for Trichy city remains a non-starter for the past four years.

To tackle the transport challenges in the city such as lack of coordination between stakeholder departments, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) under the National Urban Transport Policy (NUTP) selected around 10 cities including Trichy to set up UMTA, a professional body to address lapses in urban transport. With multiple stakeholders involved such as Railways, Airports Authority of India (AAI) and the regional transport department, UMTA was intended to serve as a common platform to implement proposals for improving the city’s urban mobility.

Though other cities selected for UMTA such as Chennai, Kochi and Hyderabad are at various level of progress in making use of UMTA, the proposal for Trichy remains only on papers. Despite the launch of operations document for Trichy UMTA in May 2016 and subsequent draft legislation prepared for introducing UMTA in the state assembly, no progress is made in materialising the regulatory body. UMTA for Trichy should have had the district collector as chairperson and officials from Trichy City Corporation , NHAI and TNSTC as members of the task force, but nothing has happened.

“UMTA can be definitely a solution for planning Trichy’s public transportation system. The present bus routes were poorly planned and need to be streamlined once UMTA is formed,” K Shyam Sundar, member, Trichy Intra-City Development Endeavours (TIDES), said. UMTA comprising at least 15 departments, including Trichy City Corporation and city traffic police, will find solutions through periodical meetings to achieve an improved city-suburban rail and road connectivity and better road infrastructure. Senior officials who were part of the discussions for UMTA Trichy since 2016 are not in service here, and several officials who are new in the stakeholder departments are not aware of UMTA proposal. When contacted, Trichy MP Su Thirunavukkarasar said, “Will study the prospects of UMTA Trichy to discuss with the relevant authorities and departments to implement it.”

Kolhapur: Ten days after mobile phones worth Rs 2.31 lakh were stolen by unidentified persons from the record room of Jaysingpur police station, police have succeeded in nabbing two people for their alleged involvement in the crime.

They have been identified as Raghunath Balaso Kadam (28) and his accomplice Pawan alias Vikas Patil (21) , both residents of Gandhinagar in Jaysingpur.

They were produced before a local court and remanded to police custody till January 23.

Both are criminals are on police record are have been involved in series of crimes such as theft and robbery, said police.

“On August 25, we had arrested Kadam for allegedly stealing cash from a co-operative society in Jaysingpur. During routine action against him, we had seized two mobile phones from him for investigation of the case. As per the court’s order, we returned one mobile phone to him and kept the other one with us for further investigation. Kadam told us that the mobile phone belongs to his girlfriend and asked us to return it. Police told him that they will return the phone once they get the court’s order,” said a police officer attached with the Jaysingpur police station.

“Kadam decided to steal the phone from the police station and return it to his girlfriend. He planned the robbery with his friend. On the night of January 9, he and his friend managed to sneak into the police station through the back door. That was the only place that was not covered by the CCTV cameras. The duo broke open the door of the record room where we had kept all the mobile phones, took them and fled from the spot,” the officer added.

“Following the incident, we had formed ten teams to investigate the case in details. We also received CCTV footage from shops located at the back side of police station and, based on it, we identified suspects and nabbed them,” he said.

The officer also said that the duo had put all the mobile phones in a sack and dumped it into the Krishna river from Arjunwad-Miraj bridge.

Aurangabad: The state government’s decision to allow shops, malls, pubs and eateries to remain open 24X7 in non-residential areas from January 26 has failed to impress the stakeholders in Aurangabad. They said even when the move was introduced two years ago, it did not garner good response.

The previous state government had amended the Maharashtra Shops and Establishments (Regulation of Employment and Service Condition) Act, 2017, paving the way for round-the-clock functioning of malls and restaurants. The amendment had permitted all shops to remain open in three shifts with appropriate day-offs for their employees.

Different commercial establishments said they did not extend their work hours as they did not anticipate heavy flow of customers at night and there was also the burden of additional staff salaries to consider.

Shrimant Patil, proprietor of hotel Chaurangi in Jawahar colony, said a tier-2 city like Aurangabad would not have good business like Mumbai at night. “Arrangement of the staff to deliver services is part of the logistics required to remain operational at night,” he said.

As per the amended law, smaller establishments would not require licences, but will have to register online. Several establishments said such a procedure was not in place yet. Some establishments also accused the law enforcing agencies, especially the police, of enforcing a 11pm deadline.

Assistant commissioner of police (Crime) Nagnath Kode said establishments coming under the 2017 legislation and with more than 10 employees can operate round-the-clock, after getting a licence. “Just one or two establishments here have taken such a licence,” he said.

“Liquor-serving places have to work under the legal framework defined by the excise department. These establishments can serve food till 12.30am and liquor till 1.30 am. Bar-cum-hotels can serve food 24X7 after getting licences” he added.

197,['20/01/2020'],Delhi: How relief on electricity bills is powering election campaigns,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Before the 2015 assembly polls, bijli half paani maaf was a catchy promise of the Aam Aadmi Party . Voters are circumspect about election-time assurances, but this is one commitment, most city dwellers feel, that has been met. Last month, over 38 lakh consumers got electricity bills amounting to nil despite the December cold, according to the power distribution companies.Subsidised power became available after AAP came to power in 2015, and since August 2019, the state government has fully freed consumption up to 200 units of electricity and partly subsidised utilisation of 201-400 units. The government also offered a flat Rs 800 discount to those who consumed a maximum of 400 units of power. Right now, Delhi is the only state to have free electricity up to 200 units.Power and water, which is also free if consumption is under 20,000 litres per month, has left Delhiites happy. In Bhumiheen Camp near Kalkaji, shopkeeper Pramod Mandal contentedly reveals that more than 90% of the JJ colony’s households now get zero power bills. This is enough to make life easier in the damp and cramped quarters. “Living conditions may not be good, but we’ve seen some progress. Savings of even Rs 1,000 a month is a lot for a family here,” Mandal noted.For Bawana resident Rakesh Kumar too, there’s a little more money in the wallet at the end of the month. “Water is free. The power bill is minimal in summer and nil in winters. Medicines are free. Education of top quality is free,” the daily-wage earner said. “We just have to worry about food. What more can an aam aadmi struggling to eke out a living expect?”According to Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited, 11.2 lakh users did not have to pay a paisa for energy in December 2019, while 9.1 lakh got the same benefit in November. After the August announcement of full subsidy, 4.9 lakh of Tata Power’s 17.2 lakh customers cashed in on the largesse in September 2019.In the capital’s areas serviced by Reliance-owned discoms BSES Rajdhani Power Limited and BSES Yamuna Power Limited, more than 10 lakh consumers got full subsidy in September, while 12.5 lakh got rebates of up to Rs 800. In October, 15.8 lakh availed of free electricity, and 12.7 lakh paid half the cost of units up to 400 they had utilised. In November and December, the number of full beneficiaries were 24 lakh and 26.8 lakh, respectively, while 8.9 lakh and 6.9 lakh consumers got subsidies under the 201-400 units category.More people benefit in the winter months. As a Tata Power official explained, “Consumers used ACs in September, but not in November and December. Using fewer units avails them the subsidy benefits. In summer, 27% of consumers limited use to 200 units, but this number is expected to have risen to around 65% in winter.”The power companies gets the subsidy reimbursed by Delhi government, which needs, therefore, to spend Rs 1,800-2,000 crore on this annually, according to a power department official. Something that gladdens the hearts of voters will never be accepted without a political murmur, so alleging that the power department had issued order to provide free power only till March 31, Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari asserted, “It is just an election gimmick.”According to Delhi government, however, official schemes are budgeted for every financial year. The free electricity scheme is a long-term one and its cost will be included in the new budget, it insisted.Not everyone, of course, gets free power. “The upper middle class does not get much from the scheme,” said B S Vohra, president, Federation of East Delhi RWAs. “Instead of lowering the power tariff and asking for a CAG audit of the discoms, the government is offering subsidies to win over the masses. The money for the power scheme comes by avoiding other necessary work such as repairing roads and potholes and so on.”But the popularity of AAP’s electricity subsidy scheme has prompted both Congress and BJP to promise similar — or even higher — relief if elected to power. While Congress has announced it will subsidise up to 600 units of electricity if its forms the government, BJP has assured “five times more benefits than what the Arvind Kejriwal government is promising”.Are the voters swayed? Md Ashfaz, 53, said in Seelampur, “All parties are now making tall promises only to get elected. We know who made the promises and also kept them.”",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73405203,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-157876,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi-assembly-elections/how-relief-on-electricity-bills-is-powering-election-campaigns/articleshow/73410925.cms

TRICHY: Equipping itself with improved facilities to keep pace with the challenge posed by private hotels, Hotel Tamil Nadu will soon be adding 15 deluxe rooms and a spacious conference hall.

Owned by Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation (TTDC), a three-storey building is being raised at a cost of Rs 4.1 crore. The work is expected to be completed in six months, according to TTDC officials.

Hotel Tamil Nadu presently has 30 rooms, a bar, restaurant and a conference hall. The new three-storey building raised after bringing down an existing building with 24 rooms will have facilities designed to suit contemporary needs.

The building will accommodate 15 rooms in which two will be suit rooms. Besides, it will have a conference hall with a seating capacity of 112 people.

Saying that more space is given to accommodate a conference hall in the new building, regional manager, TTDC G Sabesan said that it has been done after keeping in mind the demand for such conference halls.

The existing conference hall has a limited seating capacity of 80 seats. There has been an increase in business activities in the city and demand for conference hall with over 100 seating capacity has increased. This new facility will cater to this need, he said. “We have introduced flexibility in duration of occupancy of rooms to improve occupancy rate from an average 65 percent and we are getting good response,” said Regional Manager, TTDC G Sabesan.

Apart from offering rooms on 24-hour basis, we have started offering rooms for six hours during day time based on availability. This is benefitting people who come to Trichy for work and want room for short duration, he said

TRICHY: Ravanan , an eight-year-old jallikattu bull, from Pudukottai district has become a nightmare for bull tamers after its undefeated run in the recently-held jallikattu events at Avaniyapuram and Alanganallur .

Social media platforms are flooded with the video footages of Ravanan raiding the jallikattu arena after entering through the vadivasal as it finds only a few tamers on the ground. As Ravanan charges, bull tamers climb up on the metal grills to escape from its onslaught.

“Only a few bulls will go on a rampage chasing bull tamers in any jallikattu event. Most of the bulls run out of the arena if not tamed. Ravanan was unstoppable and majority of the bull tamers who kept away from Ravanan says he is so ferocious,” said S Anand, 40, a spectator at the Avaniyapuram jallikattu.

Ravanan was untamed in both Avaniyapuram and Alanganallur jallikattu events. It was also adjudged the best bull in Avaniyapuram and bagged certificate, trophy and few other prizes. In Alanganallur, it came second and received a cash prize of Rs 25,000.

P Anuradha, the owner of the bull who is a weightlifting champion and police sub-inspector in Pudukottai district, said that she expected that the bull would go untamed but never thought that it would become so popular.

The malai madu breed bull was gifted to her by a friend from Thanjavur after she won her first international medal last year.

This is the first season that Ravanan was taken to Jallikattu event. She said that there wasn’t any special treatment or training given to the bull. Ravanan will continue to take part in the upcoming jallikattu events as well, she said.

His brother P Marimuthu, 33, farmer in Nemmeli Patti village in Pudukottai district, said that except for cotton seeds, we do not give any special food to our bulls.

It is left to graze on our land apart from occasional swimming in the nearby lake, he said. He owes eight such bulls; one among them is named Asuran, which will be entering the jallikattu events soon.

It should be considered as terrorist activity or as activity that can badly affect the society and necessary legal action should be taken against it,” the circular stated.Explaining the difference, Fr Antony Thalachalloor, secretary of the Syro Malabar media commission, said that the circular written by the Cardinal himself took a pastoral approach in addressing the laity and the media statement was a communication to the general public by the media commission.“The statement was written and undersigned by me and was meant for the civil society. However, when the Cardinal writes it as a circular to his laity and priests, the terminology got changed according to the audience,” said Fr Thalachalloor.Meanwhile, Riju Kanjookaran of the Archdiocesan Movement for Transparency, said that many churches in Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese ignored the circular due to difference of opinion towards its contents. “Only a handful of churches in our diocese read the circular. Those who read it, only read the part about the religious matters, like the bishop appointments,” said Kanjookaran.However, the media commission rubbished the claim. “Most churches read the circular on Sunday. Some of the churches are yet to read it during the mass as many were observing the feast of St Sebastian this Sunday. Some others were yet to receive it through post as well. To my knowledge, no one has not read the circular due to difference of opinion to its content,” said Fr Thalachalloor.The circular also talks about resolving confusions around the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, liturgy of the Church, attack towards Christians around the world, farmers’ crisis, discrimination against Christians in schemes for minorities, reservation for the backward sections in the developed communities and appointment of new bishops.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73411707,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-502256,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/church-warns-laity-of-interreligious-love-affairs/articleshow/73393796.cms

Altogether 350 colleges will hold preparations for the NAAC accreditation in the first phase

BHUBANESWAR: The higher education department has decided to engage resource persons, especially teachers from universities as guides, to help degree colleges prepare for accreditation by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC).

Asoka Kumar Das, vice chairman of the Odisha State Higher Education Council (OSHEC), said, “The teachers of seven affiliating universities, who have a fair knowledge of NAAC accreditation, will guide colleges to earn this tag.”

Altogether 350 colleges will hold preparations for the NAAC accreditation in the first phase. A NAAC tag helps a college or university get recognition, funding and assistance from the University Grants Commission (UGC) and also from the Rashtriya Uchchattar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) scheme.

Das said the colleges have to complete the preparation by March this year. “As the colleges have no substantial knowledge of the accreditation process, we have to engage some trainers to guide the college authorities. These guides will get honorarium for guiding the colleges,” he added.

Das said the guides have already received training for the same from a NAAC expert. “A guide will first visit his/her respective college and try to have an academic and administrative audit to know whether all documents are in place or not. He/she will train five teachers of the colleges’ internal quality assurance cell and help them file the application for the accreditation,” he explained.

For affiliated colleges, approximately 80 criteria, including 58 quantitative and 22 qualitative, should be filled up in detail before applying for the accreditation. Some of these criteria include student support, research, teaching learning process, curricular implementation, governance, infrastructure and library facilities, leadership and best practices. “The documentation should be very strong before the NAAC team. It should show how the institution has effectively maintained and developed educational quality,” said Das.

The guides will soon start helping the colleges in documenting and preparing reports for submission before the NAAC team to get the accreditation.

Rain has flattened samba paddy crop in Trichy

THANJAVUR: Unexpected rain that lashed delta districts flattened thousands of acres of standing paddy crops that were to go for harvest in a few days, farmers said. The farmers were expecting a bumper harvest this samba season. Farmers have urged the state government to relax the maximum moisture content in crops fixed as 17% by the government for the harvest to be procured at direct procurement centres (DPCs).

Due to good monsoon and continuous flow of water in Cauvery and its tributaries, we, this year, took up samba cultivation in a larger area when compared to last year, farmers said. However, now that there are a few days to go for the harvest, the rain has played spoilsport in many parts of Tiruvarur, Thanjavur and Trichy , said S Murugesan, from Papanasam.

He had raised paddy on two acres and planned to harvest on Monday. However, due to the rain that lashed on Saturday made his entire standing crop flat. He has to wait until the rainwater to drain to harvest the crop.

The rain caused 30% to 35% loss to the farmers, secretary of Thanjavur district Cauvery farmers’ protection association Swamimalai S Vimalnathan said. “Due to rain, the moisture content would be more than 17%, which is permissible level by the government. So, TNCSC authorities will never accept our paddy with the moisture content of more than 17%. Considering this situation due to rain, the state government should relax the moisture level this season,” he added. Due to rain, the moisture content in the harvested paddy is 21 to 23% in many places. With harvest picking up at many places, farmers had to dry the paddy by spreading it on roads.

Kochi: Local bodies cannot incorporate conditions not allowed as per rules on a business’ licence on the basis of unsubstantiated allegations by local residents , the high court has said.

Justice Devan Ramachandran ruled against imposing conditions not allowed as per rules while considering a petition by Brandstorm Events Management of Kochi through advocate S Nikhil Sankar.

Maneed grama panchayat had imposed a condition in the licence granted to the company’s godown within its limits that it should not be operated between 6pm and 6am. Petitioner’s counsel contended that the condition was imposed on the licence after the local residents forced the company to sign an agreement during a ‘mediation’ by two councilors that the godown won’t be operated during these hours. These are against the procedure and provisions of Kerala Panchayat Raj (Issue of Licence to Factories, Trades, Entrepreneurship Activities and Other Services) Rules, the counsel argued while pointing out that a division had held (in Anilkumar MK and Others vs Aiswarya Rice Mill and Others, 2015) that such restrictions are illegal.

The court pointed out that the division bench’s decision was that local body cannot impose any restriction on the basis of opposition by local residents without a report affirming it by the pollution control board.

Further, the court said the course adopted by Maneed panchayat does not augur to the statutory systems. If complaints of citizens are dealt with in this manner, there would be no requirement for elaborate provisions in the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act, the court said.

209,['20/01/2020'],Govt likely to announce probe into insider trading charges in Amaravati,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Amaravati: The government is likely to announce a high-level probe into charges of insider trading against TDP functionaries in the Amaravati region. The announcement is likely to be made at the three-day assembly session, which begins on Monday, on the basis of the preliminary inquiry report of the CID on the land scam in Amaravati. The government is likely to either opt for a CBI or Lokayukta investigation into the issue, according to sources.

The CID has allegedly gathered sufficient information to prove that former TDP legislators and ministers purchased large swathes of land in Amaravati even before it was announced as the capital. The CID has found several suspicious land deals in the capital city area that were made between June 2014 and December 2014.

YSRC has alleged that many TDP leaders had prior knowledge about the location of the capital and made massive investments in the specific area way before the official announcement was made. Subsequently, many of them sold the land at high prices when land rates rocketed. The land rates were around 10- 15 lakh per acre in Thullur region (Amaravati) before the announcement was made. After which the prices shot up to nearly 3- 4 crore per acre.

The YSRC leadership would like to highlight the alleged irregularities committed by TDP during the assembly session to defend their proposal to relocate the capital. The state government is also likely to ask the CID to handover the documents to the income tax and enforcement directorate for taking up further probe into the scam.

Finance minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy had announced during the last session of the assembly that TDP functionaries were involved in the purchase of about 4,500 acres of land in Amaravati under benami names. He said the government would take a call on the issue.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Sunday finalised pre-poll alliances with Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) and Akali Dal while talks were still on to take Ram Vilas Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party and Dushyant Chautala’s Jannayak Janta Party on board.

JD(U) Delhi in charge Sanjay Kumar Jha confirmed that BJP had allotted it two seats — Burari and Sangam Vihar — with a seizable Poorvanchali population. Sources said the party could field former MLA SCL Gupta from Sangam Vihar and Shailendra Kumar from Burari.

“We will contest the election with all our strength and win both seats. The model of Bihar’s development under the leadership of Nitish Kumar is attracting people and they will vote for JD(U). In Bihar, the government has provided tap water to over 50% of the people and, by the end of this year, all households in Bihar will get drinking water. Even though Delhi is the capital of the country, not all households get drinking water in their taps. People are fed up with Arvind Kejriwal and are looking for an alternative,” Jha claimed.

Akali Dal has been offered four seats — Rajouri Garden, Hari Nagar, Kalkaji and Shahdara. According to sources, BJP has offered one seat, again with major Poorvanchali presence, to LJP, and another to JJP to target the Jat community. Till late into evening, talks were on to accommodate LJP and JJP. In the 2017 Rajouri Garden by-election, Akali Dal candidate Manjinder Singh Sirsa had contested on the BJP symbol and won.

Sources said BJP wanted to keep JD(U) and LJP in good humour ahead of the assembly polls in Bihar due towards the end of the year. Nitish Kumar was likely to campaign for JD(U) as well as some BJP candidates in Delhi, sources said. LJP’s chief Ram Vilas Paswan had recently locked horns with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on the issue of water quality.

Meanwhile, chairman of Delhi Safai Karamcharis Commission, Sant Lal Chawaria, joined BJP and claimed that he was disenchanted with AAP. Delhi Commission for Safai Karamcharis was established in 2006 to safeguard the rights and interests of sanitation workers in Delhi.

Vijayawada: As tensions mount in the capital region with the special assembly session scheduled on Monday that is likely to give legislative nod to the three-capital proposal, the police have pulled out all the stops to prevent the situation from spiralling out.

Security measures across Krishna and Guntur districts have been stepped up. Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) has been imposed in the capital region and notices under Section 149 of CrPC have been served on functionaries of all political parties, which are part of the JAC, asking them not to participate in the ‘Assembly Muttadi’ and other protests.

Meanwhile, Guntur police have served notices on farmers and representatives of political parties in the district who have openly supported the Assembly Muttadi on Friday and Saturday. On Sunday, Vijayawada police served notices on MP Kesineni Srinivas (Nani), MLC Budha Venkanna, MLA Gadde Rammohan Rao, former MLAs Bode Prasad, Bonda Umamaheswara Rao and representatives from other political parties.

While opposition parties have criticised the government and police department for issuing notices, cops have justified their move citing procedures and directions of the high court.

A top official, on condition of anonymity, told TOI that notices under section 149 CrPC are not new and part of the procedure under section 144 CrPC. “Even the high court said in its recent directions that prior notices are to be given about section 144” the official said.

While farmers and political parties have proposed to gherao the assembly when it meets for the special session for three days, the Amaravati Parirakshana Joint Action Committee (JAC) has also given a call for Jail Bharo and lay siege to the collectorate.

Aurangabad: Cables on the road that were responsible for a woman's death in a road accident near Ram Nagar along Jalna Road are yet to be removed from the spot.

On Saturday, a 39-year-old woman, a resident of Kasliwal Purva, was riding her scooter on the road when she fell off her vehicle after it became stuck in cables in front of Sahyadri Hospital. She was run over by a truck before she could get up.

On Sunday evening, the cables could still be seen at the spot.

Aurangabad Municipal Corporation commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey said a drive would be initiated from Monday to remove the cables.

The problem of cables lying along roads in the city is not new. TOI had published reports about inconvenience caused to commuters in the area, but the AMC has been slow to react. Neighbourhoods across the city, including market areas of Old City such as Aurangapura, Gulmandi, Tilak Path, Shahgunj to Cidco and Hudco areas, have been affected by the problem.

The AMC is supposed to confiscate such cables and penalise offenders. But weak enforcement continues to jeopardise citizens' lives. Fifteen days ago, a drive by the electricity and the anti-encroachment departments managed to remove cables from roads through Zone 1, Zone 2 and Zone 5. But zones 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 were not part of the drive. Saturday's accident took place in zone 6.

Sangita Chavan, a resident of Rajiv Gandhi Nagar near Kamgar Chowk, said timely action by the AMC could've prevented tragedy.

The AMC commissioner said he visited the accident spot on Sunday. “Based on a High Court order, I had instructed civic officials to resolve the problem when I had joined in December,"" said Pandey. ""On Saturday, I called a meeting of zone officers and HoDs to discuss the problem. The drive to remove the cables couldn't take place the next day because it was a Sunday. The civic body will start a drive to remove the cables on Monday.""

215,['20/01/2020'],Odisha: Koraput panchayats turn unused land into vegetable farms,"This story is from January 20, 2020

The panchayat expects to gain at least Rs 10 lakh from the IMF hub

KORAPUT: Two months ago, 18 acres of land belonging to the panchayat in Koraput ’s Kamra lay unused and encroached upon. Eight weeks later, the Borigumma block administration, under which the panchayat falls, has successfully transformed the 18 acres into an integrated multi-farming (IMF) hub, which can not only provide round-the-year income to women’s self-help groups (SHG)s, but also provide a sustainable income to the panchayat for use in development work.

The project, which is seeing the slow but steady growth of agriculture in the tribal hinterland of Odisha, is the first of its kind in the state, and has been undertaken by the convergence of schemes such as MGNREGA, state finance scheme (SFC) and central financial scheme (CFC).

“Funds from the MGNREGA, SFC and CFC are mostly used in a scattered manner and on routine work like construction of ponds, roads and culverts in villages. We thought of doing something different that would have multi-dimensional benefits,” said Pranay Ranjan Behera, block development officer of Borigumma and the brains behind the scheme.

Thus, the panchayat land now has a pond measuring 150x200 feet for pisciculture, a poultry farm, a dairy farm, space for mushroom cultivation, floriculture, horticulture and a nutritional garden. It even has a vermi-compost pit. “We have planted 2,000, 3,000 and 500 units each of banana, papaya and coconut saplings. Vegetables will be grown in an organic manner and they will be supplied to schools to make mid-day meal,” said Behera

The panchayat expects to gain at least Rs 10 lakh from the IMF hub. Once completed, each unit of the IMF hub will be handed over on lease to women’s SHGs of the panchayat. “This will enhance their economy,” said Behera.

Kamra is not an isolated case; the block is developing similar IMF hubs on unused land between 10 and 18 acres in all its 31 panchayats. Work is under way in Malda, Kamra, Benasur, Hardoli, Nuaguan, Munja, Sasahandi and Borigumma panchayats. “Each project of an IMF hub requires an investment of Rs 40 to Rs 45 lakh and the SHGs would be properly trained in maintaining them before they are handed over to the groups,” said Satyanarayan Sethi, assistant engineer, Borigumma block.

The challenges are many. Being a tribal-dominated area, the people here have been engaged in traditional activities and will now have to be motivated to take up settled agriculture. Officials said it would also require work to convince panchayats to divert funds to the IMF project. “Initially, the panchayats were against diverting funds for the integrated farming hub. The concept itself was new for them,” Behera, adding that the panchayat representatives needed a lot of convincing.

The project has not only provided the panchayats a regular income, it has also beatified the area and saved land from encroachers. “We never imagined that farming could be done in such an integrated manner. We are happy to see the development and we hope to create more such units in the panchayats,” said Nadai Bhatra, a resident of Malda panchayat.

Vijayawada: Assembly speaker Tammineni Sitharam on Sunday warned of serious consequences if anyone tries to hinder the assembly session. He directed the police to make arrangements so that the session can be conducted smoothly. Everyone has the right to protest but should not cross the limits,” said the speaker.

Sitharam criticised TDP for urging protesters to lay siege to the assembly. He said no one would be allowed to stall assembly proceedings. “Creating obstruction in assembly proceedings will surely land the agitators in trouble. Such actions mount to insulting the Constitution,” said the speaker, adding that the assembly would be within its right to summon those who create obstructions and take action against them.

He said people have the right to express their dissent and participate in agitation, but in a peaceful manner. He advised the protesters to stay calm and raise their issues peacefully. He suggested that farmers should discuss their issues with the government. tnn

Amaravati: The TDP has demanded that the state government allow peoples in all the 175 assembly constituencies to vote on the shift of capital city from Amaravati. The party said it would not raise any further objection if a majority of the people support the government proposal.

TDP supremo Chandrababu Naidu chaired a legislature party meeting at the party’s central office in Mangalagiri on Sunday. Naidu discussed the strategy to be adopted in the assembly session to counter the state government’s plans to shift the capital out of Amaravati. Interestingly, at least five-six MLAs stayed away from the meeting, including Ganta Srinivasa Rao, Vallabhaneni Vamsi and Maddali Giridhar.

Speaking to the media after the TDLP meeting, senior legislator Nimmala Ramanaidu said neither Visakhapatnam will benefit from shifting of few government offices as it was already a big city, nor the relocation of the high court would benefit Rayalaseema region. The TDP believes that decentralisation of development is required to develop the under-developed regions but three-capitals will not help it, he said.

“We demand that the government conduct a fair peoples ballot in all the constituencies on the issue of decentralisation of the capital city. We will accept the peoples’ mandate whichever way it goes,” said Ramanaidu.

TDP issued a whip to all its legislators asking them to attend the assembly session and participate in the voting if required. The party asked the legislators to follow the instructions of the party during the voting and legislators who violate the whip might attract action. TDP is worried about a few legislators extending their support to the YSRC government in the assembly.

CM Kejriwal’s wife Sunita and daughter Harshita campaign for AAP

NEW DELHI: Humility will always open more doors of support. This seems to be the mantra that has been adopted by the family of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal .

While the AAP national convener was out on Sunday publicising his “guarantee card” to people as a part of his campaign for the assembly polls, his wife Sunita, daughter Harshita and son Pulkit were going around the West Ansari Nagar constituency to take feedback from the electorate. And all this was being done by them as common party workers without advertising who they were.

The three family members were accompanied by four AAP workers without any pomp and show while going door-to-door at the doctors’ and staff quarters of AIIMS.

In F-Block, Sunita asked the residents, “How many voters are there in your household?” After getting an answer, she requested them to vote for AAP and handed over the party’s “report card”. Harshita and Pulkit apprised the youth about the good work done by the AAP government in colleges, schools and hospitals.

Pulkit said that he attended college from Monday to Friday and dedicated the weekend to campaigning for his father. “Massive changes have been done in Delhi government schools and, as a result, they have reached the top spots. I have been telling people about the good education being imparted by government schools in the capital,” he added.

Harshita said, “Most of the people I interacted with raised concerns about pollution. My father eagerly waits for us at home to tell him the feedback and suggestions given by people.”

“I will campaign on weekdays the entire day and my son and daughter will join me in the evening after finishing off their work and studies,” said Sunita.

At times, the volunteers let it slip that the three “workers” campaigning at people’s doorsteps were in fact the CM’s family members. This was when a flurry of activity ensued and people rushed to take selfies with the trio. A resident, Anjali Devi, said, “I had never imagined that a chief minister’s family could be so humble.”

Aurangabad: Barely 20 days after the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) issued a WhatsApp helpline to address civic issues, residents have expressed dissatisfaction over its usefulness, adding that several complaints have not been addressed through the helpline number.

In a public notice issued by the public relations department of the municipal corporation, the number 9607933541 was announced as the AMC helpline number. The notice stated that residents can send in their complaints about civic issues through Whatsapp on the number. The AMC had asked residents to send photos and videos related to the problem through the mobile app on the helpline.

According to Rahul Ingle, activist of Shahar Parivartan Aghadi, several complaints related to water pipeline and valve leakages, non-functioning streetlights, street dogs and waste collection were made on the helpline, but the complainants have not received any solution.

“I have personally made several complaints, but no official from the municipal corporation turned up to address the matter. Residents are worried about insect and snake bites while entering the Amrut Garden in the Cidco N-3 area due to lack of maintenance in the garden. A complaint in the regard was filed through the helpline number 15 days ago, however, there has been no response from the civic body,” Ingle said.

Prahlad Dandge from Mukunwadi had lodged a complaint about street dogs menace and Aman Timothy had lodged a complaint about drainage waste lying on roads in the Cidco N-5 area. Neither of the complaints have been addressed.

Municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey, who conceptualised the helpline, said that he had taken a review meeting regarding the functioning of the helpline last week and had encountered some problems.

Secunderabad: With local authorities gearing up to solve water and sewage problems in Sithaphalmandi, TOI asked readers about other areas facing similar issues

HMWS&SB supplies water every alternate day in most areas. However during summer, residents experience a torrid time due to low water pressure. Throughout the year, water pressure is uneven due to wastage of water on account of leaking pipelines. Despite several reminders, leakages have still not been plugged at all places. HMWS&SB authorities should take a concerted stand to disconnect all illegal water connections. With regard to the sewage, overflowing drains are a common sight. Despite residents articulating their views through print media and interacting with officials on several occasions, no substantial action has been taken — Srinivasan Ramaswamy

The government should not accord permission for fresh residential constructions till ground water level improves in all areas and supply of municipal water is stabilized. Though there is a limit on the depth to which you can dig a borewell, most of the borewells are dug illegally. The government must also work to increase the water supply. Developmental work in colony could be taken with the contribution of residents — Ravindranath Todehal

Most areas in Secunderabad face the issue of irregular water supply. The government and authorities should ensure strict supply of clean drinking water on alternate days. People should be educated on how to use water smartly. Most drainage systems need to be overhauled and the issue of encroachment should not be ignored. Strict vigil is the solution to contain encroachments. Most of the drains are blocked and this leads to inundation during monsoon. This is must be looked into — Deepesh Surana

Those visiting Niloufer Cancer Hospital are compelled to walk on sewage water overflowing from a drain adjacent to the hospital. Authorities must immediately fix this as an open drain is not just unhealthy but there have also been cases of people slipping of the sewage water and hurting themselves. Though authorities have been informed about the situation, no action has been taken — Syed Shamsuddin Maghrabi

The residents of Trimurthy colony, Mahendra Hills are facing severe water shortage issues. We only getting water once in three days. Sometimes due to problems with the supply system we have not received water even after four days. Why are we not being provided with water despite paying house tax and water charges promptly? I request the authorities to provide water to our colony on alternate days — Umesh Chandra Pandey

The problem of sewage and water shortage is common is several areas such as Lalaguda, Addagutta, Ambedkar Nagar, Nallagutta,Bhoiguda etc . I request the concerned authorities and local corporators to look into the problem and find a permanent solution to these long standing issues — Nandikanti Sai Kumar

Around 500 residents participated in the protest rally on Sunday

Vadodara/ Anand: Karamsad town of Anand district on Sunday witnessed fresh round of protest with around 500 residents taking part in a rally demanding due recognition for the ancestral town of Sardar Patel.

The agitation per se is not new as discontentment had been brewing here since the last two years on the same agenda.

However, fresh fears of the town losing its identity were triggered after the merger with Anand Nagarpalika surfaced. The rally, which was organized by Mithilesh Amin, former councillor of Karamsad Nagarpalika, took place from Karamsad bus stand to Sardar House, the place where country’s first deputy Prime Minister and India’s Iron man had spent his formative days.

“Under the garb of development, the state government is proposing to merge Karamsad, Vallabh Vidyanagar and Anand,” said Amin, who now leads the Karamsad Nagarik Samiti. He added that the move is totally unwarranted as both Karamsad and Vallabh Vidyanagar are already developed. “Such a merger would only mean that Karamsad will lose its unique identity,” he said.

The rally on Sunday also witnessed the participation of religious leaders from temples located in the town apart from local people.

Amin, who had resigned from BJP on the grounds that the party did not fulfil its promise to give national status to Karamsad, alleged that there is no concrete plan on what kind of development is being planned for the town.

In 2018, Karamsad had witnessed a similar movement after a group under the umbrella of Sardar Hitrakshak Samiti had started an indefinite hunger strike demanding special recognition for Karamsad.

Rashesh Patel, a resident who has done research on Sardar Patel’s life, vowed to continue with the protest.

“If merging a town is the only solution, the state government should first merge Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s hometown Vadnagar with Visnagar which is a bigger town. Let’s see if Vadnagar ends up being just another part of Visnagar, or the merger brings development to Vadnagar. If the latter takes shape, a year later, they can talk of merging Karamsad with Anand,” Patel asserted.

The 54-km-long coastal division has been divided into four sectors for enumeration of dolphins

BERHAMPUR: Dense fog coupled with high tidal waves in the sea played spoilsport during the annual dolphin survey off the Ganjam coast scheduled to begin on Sunday morning.

The Berhampur forest division was forced to reschedule the headcount to Monday in the coastal areas of the district. The survey in the Chilka Lake was conducted successfully.

“We were forced to put off the census along the coast owing to poor visibility,” the divisional forest officer, (Berhampur), Amlan Nayak, said.

The wildlife division of the state forest department had scheduled to conduct the dolphin survey along the coast and the Chilika Lake. “As per schedule, the survey teams reached the spots in different sectors along the Ganjam coast at 6am. But they could not venture into the sea owing to the fog as well as the rough sea,” the range officer of Berhampur, Raja Rao Subudhi, said.

The 54-km long coastal division has been divided into four sectors for the enumeration of dolphins . They are Prayagi to Purunabandh, Purunabandh to Gopalpur, Gopalpur to Markandi and Markandi to Patisunapur. At least five persons have been engaged in each sector for the enumeration using binoculars.

The division had successfully conducted the pre-survey of dolphins in the coastal area on January 9 when they sighted the congregation of different species. “We noticed bottlenose and humpback species of the dolphins off the coast,” the range officer said .

Last year, they had sighted 29 dolphins of two different species during the census off the Ganjam coast. There were 15 humpback dolphins and 14 bottlenose ones, an official said.

AYODHYA: To ease pressure on junior police personnel and to address their grievance of never getting leave from work, Ayodhya police have introduced an electronic leave management system .

Sub inspectors and constables can now apply for leave through the Smart E Police app. They would not have to meet any officer to personally request them for leave. Launched in Ayodhya as a pilot project, the app will be introduced for other districts too.

Ayodhya SSP Ashish Tiwari said, “The Smart E Police app can be downloaded on any mobile phone. Sub inspectors and constables can apply for leave through this app and expect immediate response from their seniors.”

As soon as an officer applies for leave, the app will show the applicant’s leave history and availability of other personnel in their police station or unit on the said dates. Accordingly, the applicant will be granted leave.

Before going on leave, the applicant will get their ‘rawaangi’ (departure) registered on the app. On return, they will register ‘aamad’ (arrival) on the app. The information will automatically be sent to the applicant’s SHO, CO and ASP.

For an emergency leave, the applicant will choose the ‘emergency’ option in the app.

“When I took charge, I met a constable who had been running from SHO to CO then to ASP before coming to me in the evening to ask for leave. His mother had passed away but for 24 hours after he got the news, he had been running around for approval. I hope such a situation does not arise again,” said Tiwari.

230,['20/01/2020'],AMC sits over rampant water wastage plaints,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Aurangabad: A damaged 700 mm water pipeline on the railway station road for the past three years is leading to rampant wastage of water and the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), which is supplying water once in 6 days to residents, appears to be in no rush to plug the problem.

The water leaking from the pipeline percolates under the ground and flows out near the Labh Chambers shopping complex across the road, leading to waterlogging. Owing to this, the 13 shops in the shopping complex are being subjected to constant inconvenience.

These businesses have employed two 2-horsepower automated motors that 24x7 keep pumping out the water into the drain. However, if any of the two motors develop a snag, those vising the complex are in for major trouble. The shopowners are spending around Rs 2,000 every month for running the motor.

According to Bagyesh Mhaske Patil, owner of two offices in the complex, the problem is going on for the last 3 years. “We have made several representations to Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). At first they were in denial that it is the water from the pipeline but after we presented them the test report, it was established that it was potable water. The engineers from the civic water department stated that they have sought permission from the AMC’s road department to dig the road to check and repair the leakage,” he said.

The shopowners have registered complaints with the AMC but inaction on part of the civic officials is not only leading to inconvenience but also wastage of water.

Municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey said he is not aware of the matter. “I will check with my officials and instruct necessary action,” he said.

Pandey had earlier rapped the civic officials for water wastage due to valve leakage in Hudco area.

NEW DELHI: In a major drug haul, Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) seized a consignment of a staggering 7,24,840 tablets and 1,400 injections of opioid-based analgesic Tramadol worth crores of rupees. Three traffickers, including a wholesale medicine trader and a chemist, have been arrested till now.The module operated across north India and is suspected to be part of a bigger international syndicate trying to push the drug — which is getting extremely popular among teenagers — to school and college students in Delhi.While raids are on in Delhi, UP and Punjab and more arrests are likely, NCB is trying to reach to the source and kingpin of this syndicate. The arrested men — Manoj Kumar, Mohit and Gaurav Aggarwal — are natives of Agra. They were nabbed by a special team led by NCB zonal director KPS Malhotra.A few days ago, NCB had received inputs that a few people involved in the illicit trade of psychotropic drugs were getting delivery at a courier firm’s office.Teams comprising additional director Kuldeep Sharma conducted a raid and seized a parcel containing 50,000 Tramadol tablets. Another raid was carried out in Ludhiana, where the parcel was supposed to be shipped, and the receiver, Kumar, was arrested. Kumar, who runs a medicine shop, revealed that the parcel was sent by Aggarwal, who was subsequently apprehended. Mohit, the wholesale dealer, was arrested later and the entire consignment seized.“Kumar didn’t have a licence to trade narcotics and psychotropic medicines. He committed the crime owing to the huge profit margins in the illicit retail and wholesale trade of psychotropic medicines. He used to supply these medicines to various parts of the country,” Malhotra said.The drugs were diverted from lawful channels into the trafficking network, Malhotra said, adding, “The seized psychotropic medicines were produced by companies having a valid licence. We are trying to analyse the diversion from the manufacturing/logistics channel. The role of pharmaceutical companies, dealers and retailers is being investigated.”AIIMS professor Dr Lall said the seized drug is of schedule H/H1/X, which needs a doctor’s prescription to procure from a pharmacist. “The seized drugs are anti-anxiety, sedatives and painkillers, which are both habit forming and create dependence. They are used in both post-operative care and drug deaddiction centres. The effect of these drugs on the brain is similar to heroin/opioid-based narcotics and are administered to control withdrawal symptoms in patients at drug deaddiction centres,” he added.Tramadol is used in the treatment of moderate to severe pain, but misused by teenagers for mood enhancement and euphoria. WHO says the drug can produce physical dependence when used daily for more than a few weeks.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73413031,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-99591,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/high-crimes-opioid-based-drug-worth-crores-seized-3-arrested/articleshow/73396851.cms
234,['20/01/2020'],Maharashtra: CARA advises special counselling sessions,"This story is from January 20, 2020

PUNE: The Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) has directed all state adoption resource authority offices and adoption institutions to conduct special counselling sessions for “older”children put up for adoption.

In a recent directive, they have told all State Adoption Resource Authority (SARA) bodies across the country and the child care institutions to have special sessions to address adaptation or adjustment issues of older children placed under adoption.

In the last five years, over 1,000 cases of children above the age of eight years have been returned to the institutions across the country over adjustment issues. The state too had over 200 such cases as per data provided by the authority.

CARA officials told TOI that while they are placing older children in homes, adjustment issues need addressing. All state governments have to take it upon themselves to address this issue through their regional state adoption resource authority offices, the official said.

“There should be special counselling sessions and older children adoption issues have been an issue. Special counselling will help and we are working on it,’’an official from CARA said.

Data indicate that the highest number of children returning to institutions was in 2014-15_a total of 387 of the 4,362 adopted children. In 2015-16, a total of 236 of the 3,677 adopted children returned by adoptive parents.

In 2016-17, a total of 195 of 3,788 adopted children were returned while in 2017-18, a total of 153 of a total of 3,927 adopted children were returned by adoptive parents, the data shared by CARA stated. The 2018-19 numbers showed that a total of 133 out of 4,027 children were returned by adoptive parents.

A counsellor working in one of the adoption agencies told TOI that older children do face issues. The child care institutions must groom these children accordingly and ready them with proper counselling . Parents who adopt older children need a different strategy, she added.

A parent in her mid-40s, who adopted a slightly older child, had to attend counselling sessions with the institution and outside with her daughter so that they do not face adjustment issues. “My daughter had adjustment issues initially but we had to work on our relationship and be patient,’’ the parent told TOI.

At child care institutions, children are groomed in a different way. They have to be prepared and counselled for adoption so that they adjust with the new families, another official from a home care institution, said. “Their attachment to the institution and caretaker makes them want to come back,’’she added.

HYDERABAD: With a drop in temperature, there has been a steady rise in number of swine flu ( H1N1 ) cases in the state. As many as 35 cases have been reported since the beginning of the year, most of them are from the city and its peripheral areas. Officials had sent out prior alerts of a possible outbreak in recent months and expect the number of cases to rise till February.

Currently, two patients are undergoing treatment at Gandhi Hospital while another is being treated at the Chest Hospital. The 35 samples which have tested positive are among 138 samples which tested for the presence of the virus. It is reported the virus may have mutated.

However, officials are not raising an alarm as there was no outbreak reported. “Most cases are reported from different areas of the city with many samples being sent from corporate hospitals. With the temperature fluctuation, this had been expected but the numbers are less than what they were during the same period last year. It is possible that a mutation may occur given the two-year trend of change in strain noticed so far,” said a senior official from the state health department .

In anticipation of an H1N1 outbreak, the health department had been issuing advisories since last two months. While district hospitals and tertiary centres have been advised to prepare and review their isolation wards, district-level officials have been asked to redirect all suspected cases to the tertiary centres in the city — Gandhi Hospital, Osmania General Hospital and Niloufer Hospital.

237,['20/01/2020'],Pune: Activists express concerns over doubtful citizenship tag in NPR,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Citizens protest CAA and NRC at Kauserbaug on Sunday

PUNE: Citizens and civic acivistis have expressed concerns over the chances of getting the “doubtful citizenship” tag during collection and verification of the National Population Register ( NPR ) data by the local registrar or the district collectorate.

They claimed that an individual or a family could be marked “doubtful” during the NPR process, though there were no rules defined in the statute to put anyone in the category.

“The Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003, has not defined what is ‘doubtful citizenship’. In fact, it does not even exist in the main law — Citizenship Act of 1955. All it says in the sub-rule (4) of Rule 4 that the ‘local registrar’ will make such a marking,” a citizen said on condition of anonymity.

“If the discretion is left to the local registrars, then biases are bound to emerge. If a citizen is born in India, there should be no reason for him/her to prove the citizenship. While NPR has been showcased as a drive to ensure security, it will declare many citizens under the ‘doubtful category’ and categorize them as ‘non-citizens’,” People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) activist Manisha Gupte activist said on Sunday.

“The minority, women without proper documents in the rural areas and children born at home will suffer the most. The drive will put the minority in trouble,” she said.

Ramesh Awasthi of PUCL said, “Many members of my family won’t be able to prove their citizenship because my grandparents came from Lahore and Rawalpindi during the Partition. Whoever chose to stay in India after the Partition have proved their citizenship at the time of Independence. They should not have to go through it again.”

Activist Aslam Isak Bagwan said, “The new columns in the NPR demanding birth certificates and records of parents are unnecessary. This will unnecessarily put everyone in the ‘doubtful’ category and add to the children's’ woes.”

Alsaba Sheikh, also an activist, said, “When people have their voter ID card and passport, then why hold a drive such as NPR that will put many in the ‘doubtful citizenship’ category? We have been protesting against the drive for the last 10 days in Kausar Baug.”

The 2003 Rules provide for verification of the details in the population register by the local registrar, who will find out the cases of “doubtful citizenship” and conduct further enquiries. Once the enquiries are done, the local registrar will prepare a draft (Local Register of Indian Citizens) that will exclude people unable to prove their citizenship through documentary evidence.

Several activists and former bureaucrats have pointed out that it was at this stage that the experience of Assam’s citizens could cause apprehensions in the minds of those required to establish their citizenship, whether or not they profess any religion.

The NPR 2020, unlike NPR 2010, asks not only for the names of the parents of the residents, but also seeks to record their dates and places of birth. A person unable to furnish details for his/her parents or, for that matter, for himself/herself could well be classified as a “doubtful citizen”.

“People across the country are seen rushing to get their birth certificates. The problem is magnified in a country where the maintenance of birth records is poor. The highly inefficient birth registration system makes the matter worse,” an official said on condition of anonymity.

Hyderabad: Condemning the arrest of Osmania University associate professor Ch Kaseem over alleged Maoist links, several teacher unions, including United Teachers ’ Federation (UTF), Telangana Teachers’ Federation (TTF) and Telangana Progressive Teachers’ Federation (TPTF) have demanded the immediate release of the academic.

They said that it was unconstitutional to arrest Kaseem, who has been teaching and penning revolutionary writings for years now.

“False cases registered against Kaseem should be withdrawn and he should be released immediately,” Chava Ravi of UTF said, adding his arrest was unconstitutional.

The teachers questioned the reasons for the sudden arrest of Kaseem. “It’s not like he was absconding, he was very much at the varsity since 2013. Why arrest him all of a sudden in a false case that has been pending since 2016?” questioned E Raghunandan of TPTF.

They also took a dig at police for the way searches were conducted at the residence of Kaseem in the early hours and manhandling him. “They forcefully entered his house on the varsity campus and damaged private property. This is illegal and unconstitutional,” said Y Ashok Kumar, a teacher.

The members of Ambedkar Students’ Association, University of Hyderabad, also condemned the arrest of the OU academic and demanded his immediate release.

Kaseem joined the Telugu department at the Osmania University in 2013. Before joining OU, he had worked at Oriental College – Andhra Saraswatha Parishath. He also worked at Nizam College.

HYDERABAD: A district consumer forum has directed Jagan Studios to pay Rs 70,000 to a senior citizen , who wanted to make a short documentary along with his friends, for failing to complete the work and handover the film in CD format.

The complainant, 73-year-old R Gopal Rao, submitted that he along with other friends had enacted in several dramas since childhood and now in their twilight years, wanted to shoot their talent and preserve it in the form of CDs for their grandchildren.

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari

NEW DELHI: AAP government on Sunday came under fire from both BJP and Congress after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal released the party’s “guarantee card”.

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari likened the 10 guarantees to “10 new lies spoken to the people of Delhi” even as he asked the CM to explain the progress made on the 70 promises made in 2015. “There is a great difference between making promises and fulfilling them. The CM had made 70 promises to the people of Delhi, but when the time came for fulfilling them, he is making new promises to mislead the public,” he said.

Tiwari alleged that power companies had been given orders to supply free electricity till March 2020 only. “Kejriwal has also given a guarantee of removing the web of loose wires, but he must explain why this work was not done during the last five years. Had this work been done earlier, then the incidents of fire may not have taken place,” he claimed. “A CM who claims to have made revolutionary changes in education must answer where those 500 new schools and 20 new colleges are that he promised? He should also explain to the people why he has deprived them of the benefits of welfare schemes launched by the Centre, including Ayushman Bharat Yojana,” he added.

Tiwari also alleged that while the CM had created hindrances in the expansion of Delhi Metro, he was now giving a guarantee of providing public transport of international level. He credited the Centre for bringing down pollution by constructing eastern and western peripheral expressways. Tiwari said while the government was now guaranteeing the removal of mountains of garbage, the corporations had already installed machines for doing so.

Delhi Congress president Subhash Chopra claimed that fearing a certain defeat in the upcoming election, Kejriwal had come up with the 10 promises.

Calling it another “jumla” to fool the people of Delhi and divert their attention from AAP government’s failures in the last five years, he alleged that Kejriwal had wasted his time clashing with officials, central government, LG and municipal corporations of Delhi without fulfilling the promises he had made to the people.

With posters and flags, crowds of men, women and children continued their stir at Clock Tower on Sunday.

LUCKNOW: As strong as the 220-foot tall Husainabad clock tower, stood hundreds of women staging peaceful protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) on Sunday afternoon. Undeterred and unmoved, the women braved sweeping cold winds on a largely cloudy day, saying they were there for a “safer, secular India tomorrow.”

The nonstop protest that began on Friday afternoon, drew more support on Sunday as residents from across the city turned up to show solidarity. Some came with families and friends, holding posters in hand and chants on their lips. While women were allowed to enter the inner quadrangle, the area was cordoned off temporarily with ropes by protesters to restrict access of men. Late afternoon, the women formed a chain, holding hands to stall entry of unsocial elements.

“We have no leader . Volunteers are managing the crowd. Some are taking care of security, others taking note of speeches being made. We are making sure the protest remains peaceful. We are not Muslim women, but just women,” said Fauziya Rana, a protester.

Keeping an eye on those interacting with protesters, volunteers urged the latter not to share any information with unknown persons and ask for identity cards.

“After December 19 and subsequent police action, people thought no one will come out. But women drew inspiration from Shaheen Bagh protest. It is a secular protest, which is being attended by all those who want the country’s secular nature to remain intact,” said Veena.

After cutting off power and locking toilets, heavy police force was deployed. On Saturday night, Rapid Action Force (RAF) personnel were also stationed.

Lucknow police, meanwhile, denied allegations of seizing blankets and water bottles on Saturday night. Police officials said blankets were seized from NGO workers when those not part of protest started jumping in to take them.

Police also asked all food joints in Akbari Gate area to close by 11.30pm. “We have asked all shops to down shutters by 11.30pm. We will take action against those defying the order,” said ACP (Chowk) Durga Prasad.

249,['20/01/2020'],Shy homemaker behind Lucknow’s Shaheen Bagh,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Turiaganj resident Kausar Imran

LUCKNOW: Turiaganj resident Kausar Imran describes herself as a shy homemaker who would hardly speak up, let alone attend a protest. That was until Friday, when the 35-year-old began a massive protest at Husainabad’s Clock Tower — now being referred to as Lucknow’s Shaheen Bagh .

On Friday afternoon, the mother of three reached the iconic Clock Tower along with her children and 10 other women to launch an agitation against the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). Over the next three days, hundreds of women joined the motley group of protesters. The growing numbers reminded many of New Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, where local residents have been staging a 24/7 peaceful sit-in for more than a month.

Talking about what inspired her to launch the agitation, Kausar said, “My family was discussing what was happening in Shaheen Bagh while watching the news on Thursday evening. Listening to them, I wondered what homemakers like me could do here. My husband then drew similarity between me and the homemakers of Delhi who were participating in the protest. I was cooking dinner when I decided that we would have to do something to save the country.”

“My three children, aged six, eight and 13, and my niece who is 24 encouraged me and we stayed up all night making posters,” said Kausar, who has received formal schooling only till fifth standard.

The homemaker said that she and her children went door-to-door in her locality seeking support. “We literally begged women to come out. By Friday afternoon, we were some 15 people including the children who stood at the Clock Tower to protest against CAA and NRC.”

“We made posters which read ‘we reject CAA, no NRC’ and ‘we are Indians’ and came here after Friday prayers around 2.30pm. Not many people had turned up by then, but we still decided to go ahead,” said 24-year-old Safiya, Kausar’s niece.

Hiding the posters in the layers of her burqa, Kausar and others managed to sneak past the police to reach Clock Tower on Friday afternoon. The moment they brought out the posters, police ran towards them to stop them.

“I told them that I can tape my mouth and will even turn into a stone, but would not move from the spot. When they told me that I had no permission to protest, I said that I wasn’t creating any ruckus. The electricity supply was snapped in the area that night, but even my youngest did not cry or ask to go home. We sat there undeterred. Now, I feel overwhelmed by sheer number of women sitting with us,” she added.

AURANGABAD: An action committee, involving eminent personalities from different walks of life, has been formed for the development of Pathri. Meanwhile, chief minister Udhhav Thackeray is slated to meet delegations from Shirdi and Pathri in Marathwada to diffuse the row over the birthplace of Saibaba.

The panel is scheduled to plan the future course of action for pursuing the demand to release the Rs 100 crore aid for Pathri as announced by the CM during his meeting on Tuesday.

Baba Jani Durrani, NCP MLC from Pathri who took the initiative to form the action committee, said a section of residents of Shirdi was opposing the development of Pathri out of fear of losing revenue associated with the tourist footfall.

“We have formed an action committee for constructive purpose. We will not give a call for any bandh or other extreme steps which will affect the devotees. The action committee will explore democratic and other legitimate ways for the development of Pathri,” he said.

Meanwhile, the trust that manages Pathri temple of Saibaba said a group of devotees from South India visited the shrine on Sunday owing to the call for bandh in Shirdi.

“Devotees from different parts of India visit Pathri to take darshan of Saibaba. A group of devotees from South India came to Pathri for the first time and told us that it was a fulfilling experience to visit the birthplace of the saint,” Sanjay Bhusari, trustee of the temple, said.

The trust has already said that those opposing development of Pathri temple were hurting the sentiments of Saibaba’s devotees. Asserting that it was already established fact Saibaba was born at Pathri, the trust has also condemned the call for shutdown of Shirdi highlighting that it affected devotees only.

The temple trust at Shirdi, however, has already distanced itself from the bandh. The daily routine activities at the trust such as pooja, arati and offering of prasad took place as usual on Sunday.

Among other political functionaries from Marathwada, PWD minister and former chief minister Ashok Chavan has already extended his support for the development of Pathri.

AURANGABAD: The police have arrested a 35-year old woman and her father on the charges of murdering her former husband.

The autopsy report by the forensic experts has nailed the duo.

The accused have been identified as Yasmin Shaikh and her father Shaikh Ahmed. They were produced before the holiday court, following which they have been remanded in one-day police custody.

Police said that on September 12, 2019, the 56-year old Mohammed Jawed was found hanging in his house. Not convinced that Jawed would commit suicide, his brother Mohammed Taher demanded an autopsy.

The forensic analysis report concluded that the man was strangled before being hanged.

MIDC Cidco inspector Surendra Malale said that after the death of his first wife, the ex-serviceman married the accused woman.

According to the police, after she found out that he had purchased some property in the name of his son from the deceased wife, she started pestering him for getting a property in her name too.

Somehow, the man managed to get another property in the name of the second wife, but this resulted in a deduction of a considerable portion from his pension.

The financial crunch led to tension between the couple, following which she divorced him.

Mohammed Jawed would go to her house and ask her to transfer back the property he had bought in her name, which often would result in a heated argument.

On September 12, Jawed reached her house inebriated and started asking her to transfer back the property, leading to an argument. Following which the woman and her father allegedly assaulted him, before strangling him.

Following his death, Yasmin contacted the deceased’s brother and made up a story saying that he has committed suicide at her house.

253,['20/01/2020'],Teachers of unaided schools feel left out,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Nagpur: Unaided schoolteachers feel that being an unorganized labour pool is leading to exploitation by not only the school management but also by teachers from aided schools who have multiple unions to represent them.

Vivek Ambekar, head of the English school unit of Maharashtra Rajya Shikshak Parishad (MRSP), says their counterparts from aided schools sometimes ‘bully’ the education department to get things done.

He says the pay disparity between teachers in aided and unaided schools is alarming. “Those teachers are earning more than Rs60,000 per month with seniors raking in almost Rs1 lakh under the seventh-pay commission. Here, even after working for a couple of decades, the senior most teacher will hardly draw Rs30,000 per month. The average salary for private schoolteachers is around Rs12,000 per month and no job security on top of that,” said Ambekar.

He added that despite having more students, the unaided schools are left out. “A majority of students are enrolled in private unaided schools in Maharashtra, yet the condition of our teachers is really bad. The government and private-aided schools maybe more in number, but their enrolment is negligible. There are so many ZP schools that have hardly 15 or so students overall,” said Ambekar. He believes that all these problems are because they belong to an ‘unorganized’ workforce. “There is a fear among our teachers of joining any organization because the management won’t appreciate that. Whereas, the aided schoolteachers have multiple unions to fight for them all the way to Mantralaya and get things done,” said Ambekar, who is based in Chandrapur.

In Nagpur, a group of ex-teachers are slowly rallying peers from other CBSE schools to come together and have a platform to speak from. The CBSE Schools’ Staff Welfare Association is demanding a school tribunal which will deal with problems of CBSE staff from across the country. Deepali Dably, who is spearheading this movement, said, “Across the country, there is no place where CBSE teachers can go and fight for their rights. We hope that authorities take up the issue seriously and ensure that the rights of CBSE teachers are secured.”

Residents of this seat, carved out in 2008 during the delimitation exercise, are mostly businessmen and professionals. A handful of JJ clusters and two villages are also part of the constituency, but these are unlikely to leave a mark on the overwhelmingly middle-class electorate living in the 154 cooperative housing societies and DDA flats in the area.SP Mishra, a retired SAI table tennis coach and resident of Sector 9, pinpointed law and order as an issue that is of some significance to the affluent households. “Every other day, a snatching takes place. Police don’t do enough,” the 65-year-old alleged. “Other issues that engage voters elsewhere in the city don’t bother people here.”Most voters are caught in a binary dilemma of having to opt for either Aam Aadmi Party or BJP. “Rohini is inhabited mostly by middle- and upper-middle-class people.

Labourers will also build over 2,500 compost pits and 3,000 soak pits.

LUCKNOW: The proposed Ganga Yatra scheduled from January 27-31 is set to come as a boon for scores of unemployed labourers as they would be roped in by state government for construction of nearly 300 Ganga ‘maidan’ (grounds) and over 450 Ganga ponds across 26 districts under the Centre’s flagship Mahatama Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS).

According to a proposal moved by rural development department, as many as 291 Ganga grounds and 454 Ganga ponds are proposed to be constructed along 1,025 gram panchayats ahead of Ganga Yatra, which is being planned between Bijnor and Ballia in two phases and covering a distance of around 1,400 kms. The first phase, between Balawali in Bijnor and Kanpur would cover 329 gram panchayats, while the second phase between Mohali Ghat in Ballia and Kanpur would cover 697 gram panchayats in 13 districts.

Confirming the development to TOI, additional commissioner, MGNREGS, Yogesh Kumar said that the department would rope in MGNREGS workers as per the need of the projects around the Ganga. Besides, around 3,881 plots along Ganga would be taken up for planting saplings, Kumar added.

The department, officials said, has already identified nearly 800 workers who would be engaged in plantation of fruit yielding tree saplings.

Kumar said that the idea of constructing Ganga maidan is to ensure cleanliness, while Ganga ponds would help in conservation of water. “The ponds would also help in recharging of the Ganga,” he said.

The proposal said MGNREGS workers would also be engaged in construction of more than 2,500 compost pits and around 3,000 soak pits to ensure bio-remedial measures for cleaning up banks of the Ganga.

While the Ganga Yatra is being projected as Ganga awareness programme, it is also taken as the BJP’s move for public outreach to mark CM Yogi Adityanath’s third year in office.

Though there is no official confirmation, sources said that the yatra may not only see participation of CM Yogi but also some of the senior union ministers. The event is also seen as an extension of ‘Namami Gange programme’ which is being overseen by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The state government has also submitted a presentation with the Centre underlining the steps that have been undertaken to ensure cleanliness in Ganga.

PANAJI: Delayed by nearly a year, the second phase of the 103m-bridge linking Patto-Neugi Nagar is nearing completion. Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) officials said that Larsen and Toubro (L&T) is currently constructing the approach roads and will subsequently lay the asphalt.

The hotmixing work is likely to commence in the coming fortnight, GSIDC officials said.

The bridge serves as a second entry point into the capital and primarily benefits students and teachers of People’s High School, Mary Immaculate Girls High School and Lok Chetna Primary School, as well as residents of the government quarters located in Bhatulem.

“Some of the minor utility services are still being shifted but it will be completed soon. The contractor will start laying the bitumen soon and we want to open the bridge by summer,” the official said.

Conceptualised by former chief minister Manohar Parrikar as a means to decongest the city and decrease commute for residents of Mala and Bhatulem, the bridge has helped reduced entry into the city by at least 1.5 km, government officers said.

However, due to the delay in completing the bridge and the poor condition of the roads, Neugi Nagar junction has become chaotic and dangerous for motorists.

Officials said that there is a proposal to create a traffic island at the junction to streamline traffic.

Parrikar inaugurated phase I of the bridge over the Rua de Ourem creek in December 2017, while phase II of the bridge was taken up only after the water pipeline adjoining the bridge was dismantled. The pre-stressed bridge is being built at a cost of approximately Rs 25 crore and includes a 1.5m footpath and a utility service duct. Phase I of the project was built for Rs 8.5 crore by L&T.

I am a resident of Koradi and have been segregating waste for the last two years. I started this initiative because I am worried by the mountains of garbage being dumped in the landfills. Paper scraps and plastic products are certainly meant to be discarded, but we can do our bit by utilizing biodegradable waste in a fruitful manner.

In my locality, there are a number of stray cows. The vegetable waste collected from my kitchen is placed in a tub and the cattle graze on it.

The leftovers from the tub (like squeezed lemons) and garden waste (like fallen leaves and flowers) are piled in an earthen pot . This pot is perforated to allow aeration. Cow dung is added to the mixture in the pot, as it greatly aids the growth of garden plants.

I learnt through a video that putting paper in the compost increases the nitrogen level of the soil. Therefore, I add pieces of paper too. This compost is used for my plants at home.

Also, I have made it a point to hand over paper products to the scrap collectors for recycling. Plastic and metal objects go into a different dustbin, and are disposed of accordingly.

Everyone should adopt the practice of utilizing their kitchen waste in the household itself. This way, we do not add to the heaps of waste accumulated in landfills, and can help prevent the odour from spreading. If you restrict this waste to your house, it will not reach the junkyards.

We should not entrust the government with responsibilities that we can manage ourselves. Citizens should be made aware of the advantages of doing their bit through household waste management.

259,['20/01/2020'],Aurangabad: Civic body to start drive against properties sans Occupancy Certificate,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Aurangabad Municipal Corporation

AURANGABAD: The cash-strapped Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has decided to crack down on properties that are in use without obtaining the mandatory Occupancy Certificate (OC) from the civic body.

The drive is expected to expose several illegal constructions and unauthorized extensions of the buildings. While getting the Completion Certificate (CC) is one of the pre-requisites for obtaining OC, the former document ensures whether the building is complete as per the building approval plan and satisfies other building criteria among other compliances.

A senior civic official said that many property owners have still not obtained the completion certificate and the proposed drive against properties sans OC is bound to expose illegal constructions in the city as citizens will have to ensure different compliances for properties as per laws.

“The number of people obtaining the OC and CC in the city is pretty low. Residential, commercial and industrial properties are set to come under scanner in terms of both the documents soon,” he added.

According to the official, Gunthewari and HUDCO areas are believed to have a large number of properties having illegal or unauthorised extensions to buildings among other city areas.=

The local civic body under the guidance of new civic chief Astik Kumar Pande has announced 25% discount on penalty towards delay in getting the OC till March-end. “Those who fail to comply with the rules will face action during a large-scale crackdown mooted beginning from the next fiscal,” the official said.

In a latest public notification, the AMC has informed the citizens that use of properties without the OC is an offence and liable for penalty. “Property users must take benefit of this waiver and avail the necessary document within stipulated timeframe to avoid the action in future,” the AMC has said.

The AMC official did not have the information about the exact number of property owners that have already availed the OC. For getting the OC, one has to pay a processing fee of Rs 500 along with other formalities.

Aurangabad deputy mayor Rajendra Janjal said citizens should complete the desired formalities related to their properties and avoid any harsh action.

MANGALURU: Dakshina Kannada zilla panchayat is all set to construct 25 anganwadi centre buildings at an estimated cost of Rs 2.5 crore.

While Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL) will release a portion of the funds required for the purpose, the remaining amount will be adjusted through the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS).

At present, 252 out of 2,106 anganwadi centres in the district have no buildings of their own. While 1,854 anganwadi centres have their own buildings, 33 are functioning in the panchayat premises, 72 are given space in community centres, 25 in Yuvaka Mandala, two in Mahila Mandala, 69 in schools and 48 are in rented premises.

Zilla panchayat CEO R Selvamani said the new anganwadi centres will be constructed providing all basic facilities. Respective gram panchayats will be taking up the construction work with the help of MRPL, he said.

Deputy director of women and child development department A Usman said a request to sanction buildings for all anganwadi centres in the district has been submitted to the government. The government has agreed to consider the demand and do the needful, he said.

New buildings for anganwadis will be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 10 lakh each. While MRPL will release Rs 5 lakh for each anganwadi, the remaining funds will be arranged through NREGS. The new buildings will have facilities for pre-school with toys, kitchen, storeroom and toilets. While 12 buildings will be constructed in Mangaluru taluk, six will be built in Bantwal, one in Sullia and three each in Puttur and Belthangady.

In addition to the construction of new buildings, the zilla panchayat also has decided to repair the existing ones. The zilla panchayat has reserved Rs 1.3 crore to repair 243 anganwadi centres, officials said, adding that the repair works have already been completed on 32 buildings.

A replica of Thirty Metre Telescope, coming up at Hawaii to observe cosmic objects, will be on display at Vigy... Read More

NEW DELHI: India’s first-of-its-kind science caravan showcasing the country’s contribution to the world’s big-ticket scientific projects like LIGO and CERN is going to halt in the national capital from Tuesday for two months after making stoppages in Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata for the last nearly one year.

The last leg of ‘ Vigyan Samagam ’, which will be inaugurated in the city’s National Science Centre by Union minister Jitendra Singh to showcase replicas of multi-country projects, provides a common platform for all mega-science programmes of the world.

Talking to TOI, Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) secretary Arun Srivastava said, “The idea to organise Vigyan Samagam was conceived in August 2018 to showcase India’s contribution to the CERN project, which is the world’s largest accelerator laboratory located between France and Switzerland. Later, members of other global projects like LIGO (gravitational-wave observatory), FAIR (proton and ion research facility in Germany), INO (neutrino observatory in Tamil Nadu), ITER (thermonuclear experimental reactor in France), TMT (upcoming Thirty Meter Telescope to probe cosmos), Square Kilometer Array (hundreds of telescopes spread over two continents in Africa and Australia being set up for monitoring the sky in different radio frequencies) and MACE (world’s second-largest gamma ray telescope being set up in Ladakh) also chipped in.”

The AEC secretary added, “Development of spinoff technologies is the outcome of such big science projects. The birth of internet started from CERN, when project scientists wanted to communicate and transfer a huge amount of data to their counterparts in 140 countries. Today, nobody can live without internet. These mega projects may look expensive now, but in future, when our natural resources get depleted, these projects will provide an answer to other sources of energy in the universe.”

On target audience, Srivastava said, “The objective is to target students, academia and the industry so that students know what is there in science for them in future and for the industry, a hybrid of all those projects where they can participate. And the response for the event is huge. In Mumbai, the footfall was 1.4 lakh, 1.3 lakh in Bengaluru, 3 lakh in Kolkata and in Delhi, we are expecting 2-3 lakh people.”

All top scientists like LIGO-US associate director (operations) Fred Raab and director general of FAIR, nuclear scientist Anil Kakodkar, former Isro chief K Kasturirangan, former DRDO chief V K Saraswat, are participating in the project.

263,['20/01/2020'],"30 years in exile: We feel like refugees in our own country, say Kashmiri Pandits","This story is from January 20, 2020

The protesters recalled their decades-long trauma at the protest march.

NEW DELHI: To mark the completion of their 30 years in exile , hundreds of Kashmiri Pandits gathered at Jantar Mantar on Sunday evening. The protest was part of “Holocaust Day”, being observed by the displaced community who were forced to flee from Kashmir to Jammu and other states in the early 90s soon after the outbreak of militancy.

“The government should immediately come out with a blueprint for the return of the community to Kashmir with honour and safety. The community should be declared internally displaced,” a 50-year old man, who didn’t want to be named, said. He said his house was burned down in front of his eyes and the women in his family were kidnapped and raped.

Talking of his trauma, he said his family had an ancestral bungalow in Kashmir and ever since they moved to Delhi in 1995, they had no option but to stay in a one-room rented accommodation. There are six remaining members in his family.

There were others in the gathering who said they had been scarred for life.

“We are educated people. Yet, we have jobs that pay us nothing more than Rs 20,000 a month,” said another protester, Ankur Kaul. “I was 13 when I saw my house being set on fire. We were told to leave Kashmir or face a worse fate. We were left with nothing,” he said, adding: “When my family realised that the women’s lives and dignity were at stake, we decided to move to Delhi. There is nothing worse than being a refugee in your own country.”

Anil Bhat was in his thirties when he came to Delhi. “Most of us are still in depression. We want to return to Kashmir, but that’s possible only if the government promises us security and rehabilitation,” he said. “We were asked to either convert or leave. We chose the latter,” he added.

Among those who were shouting slogans seeking their rehabilitation was Ritik Jotshi, whose family migrated from their ancestral Brahman Mohalla village in Anantnag district of south Kashmir. Jotshi said he was hopeful of making it back to his village to lead a life of dignity.

“This is the first time that I am joining a protest. We want the government to come out with a road map for our return and rehabilitation in the Valley without further delay,” Jotshi said. “I had visited my ancestral village for a few days after birth, but the desire in my heart to live on my land remains alive,” he added.

The protest was organised by All State Kashmiri Pandit Conference. A delegation, led by its president Ravinder Raina, later submitted a memorandum to LG of J&K, G C Murmu.

Several other organisations, including All Party Migrant Coordination Committee, Panun Kashmir, All India Pandit Conference and All Displaced KP United Forum, organised separate functions to commemorate the day.

Meanwhile, to show solidarity with Kashmiri Pandits, anti-CAA activists — on protest for over a month — observed two-minute silence at Shaheen Bagh on Sunday, an agency report stated.

264,['20/01/2020'],UPSMDC first PSU to be wound up seamlessly through NCLT,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Lucknow: In a first-of-its-kind case, a defunct UP public sector undertaking has become the only PSU in the country to be wound up under the purview of Companies Act through the National Companies Law Tribunal (NCLT). The case is unique as the closure did not happen under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), the route which most sick or defunct PSUs take.

Wholly owned by the state government, UP State Mineral Development Corporation ( UPSMDC ) has managed to not only repay its loan to the government and banks but also a part of the interest amount and all employee dues before being legally wound up.

The PSU was registered with Registrar of Companies in 1974. It suffered losses after the closure of mining operations.

Although the decision to wind up this company was taken in 2000, the state government, the 100% shareholder of the company, granted permission for legally winding it up under Companies Act in May 2018. The balance sheet for 2017-18 was audited by CAG-appointed statutory auditor.

After this, UPSMDC moved a petition before NCLT under Companies Law to be wound up.

If this process to clear all liabilities, loans, litigations and employee dues was not followed, the corporation would have had to take the bankruptcy and insolvency route under for closure, making it difficult to protect the government’s interest in terms of valuation and disposal of assets. Properties and cash worth more than Rs 100 crore were restored to the government which is incidentally more than the company’s paid-up capital.

The closure can be an example for other PSUs of UP lying defunct after being declared sick. Some of these are UPTRON, UP Chalchitra Nigam Ltd, UP Auto Tractors Limited, UP Instruments Ltd and UP Spinning Mills.

The PSU had authorized Madhukar Singh, one its general managers, to carry out the entire process.

“The process to legally wind up UPSMDC is a model of efficiency and transparency. Usually, such defunct companies take the short-cut route of declaring bankruptcy,” said Devraj Gupta, company secretary and a certified insolvency professional, who had filed the petition in NCLT.

NEW DELHI: As registration at Jawaharlal Nehru University ends and the classes begin next week, the JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) has asked students to continue boycotting classes and not register for the winter semester until they exhaust legal avenues. JNUSU will go to court against the hostel fee hike on Monday. Calling the hike illegal and against the constitution of the varsity, the JNUSU has asked students to continue with the strike that was started after October 28 last year.

In a statement to the JNU student community, the students’ union said that their call for boycott of registration still stands. “The union is filling a case in Delhi high court on Monday to quash the illegally passed Inter-Hall Administration (IHA) manual,” it said.

The union said that the petition will seek registration at old rates without late fines. “The matter would be heard on an urgent basis,” it said.

“The JNUSU also appeals the student community to boycott exams and classes until illegal modes of examination are nullified and a buffer time is given to complete the academic backlog of the monsoon semester 2019,” the statement added.

The union said it had deliberated with the JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA), who in the resolution passed in the January 17 council meeting spoke of a lecture series, and “nowhere does it mention exams to be conducted as per the schedule brought out by several centres. Any academic schedule shall only be brought through discussions between teachers and students.”

MANGALURU: The administration and tourism department should make efforts to ensure Blue Flag certification for all beaches in the coastal district, said Mangaluru City North MLA Dr Y Bharath Shetty .

He was speaking at the valedictory ceremony of Karavali Utsav and Beach Festival at Panambur Beach on Sunday. “All departments, including tourism department, should make efforts to keep our beaches clean and thereby bring Blue Flag certification for all beaches in the district,” he said.

Shetty said beaches with Blue Flag certification are eligible for special central government grant. “Hence, all beaches (in the district) can be developed and thereby attract more tourists,” he said.

Shetty said the government will hold talks with New Mangalore Port Trust to get more land for the development of Panambur Beach. “Panambur Beach can be developed on par with international standards if more land is allotted by NMPT to tourism department on lease,” Shetty said.

The Phalguni River Festival will be held in Kuloor in February or March. The government has already started the process of handing over 18 acres of land from the revenue department to the tourism department to promote river tourism at Kuloor, he said. “The government has already sanctioned Rs 7 crore for the development of Tannirbhavi and Sasihitlu beaches, Shetty said.

He lauded the efforts of district administration and tourism department for making Karavali Utsav and Beach Festival successful. “Though the state government is in a critical situation of fund crunch due to the recent flood, the organisers of Karavali Utsav have made all arrangements to hold the festival successfully with the help of donors,” Shetty said.

Deputy commissioner Sindhu B Rupesh, additional deputy commissioner M J Roopa, Mangaluru City Corporation commissioner S Ajith Kumar Hegde and Mangaluru Urban Development Authority commissioner Shrikanth Rao and other dignitaries honoured senior journalist Manohar Prasad with the “Karavali Gourava Prashasti” on the occasion.

Thousands witnessed the beach festival and cultural programmes.

267,['20/01/2020'],Plastic ban fizzles out in coastal AP,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The menace of plastic is looming over the rural areas of north Andhra. This, despite the fact that Bobbili Municipal corporation imposed a ban on plastic bags and pouches more than a decade ago, making it one of the first municipal corporations in the rural areas of the state to do so.

Despite this, even today, most villages and panchayats in north-coastal AP are clueless about dealing with the plastic menace. Another issue is the rampant use of plastic covers that have a thickness below 50 microns.

Though sources in the pollution control board claim that there is a ban imposed, it is hardly being imposed. More dangerously, in the rural belt, there is rampantly dumping of plastic in water bodies, open areas and fields. Worst of all, plastic is being burnt in public places regularly on a large scale. Sources in the APPCB said that they do not have exact data as to how much plastic is being procured, dumped and burnt.

“The problem is that we are yet to formulate a plan of action to deal with plastic. However, the ban on single-use plastic is in place. We are trying to coordinate with all the panchayats in the district and chalk out an action plan to find a proper solution to the increasing menace,” said Dr P Prasad Rao, environmental engineer, Pollution Control Board, Visakhapatnam.

While PCB officials claim that a plan of action is being chalked out, the plastic menace is encroaching even on agency hotspots of the region. Take for example the earlier untouched Lammasinghi. Today, one of the most popular tourist destinations in Vizag has fallen prey to the plastic menace. K Raghunath, former sapranch of Lammasinghi said, “What was a pristine, untouched landscape barely a decade ago has now become a plastic dump.”

As for the volumes of plastic being burnt on a daily basis, there is neither a record nor data available.

269,['20/01/2020'],"Chennai: Where is the promised daily bus pass, minister?","This story is from January 20, 2020

Representative image

CHENNAI: It has been two years since the government scrapped the Rs 50 daily passes for travelling on Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses. When complaints poured in, transport minister M R Vijayabaskar soon promised that the scheme would be revived soon after fixing security issues (by adding QR code on printed passes), but nothing has materialised.

According to official data, around eight lakh passengers bought the daily and monthly passes (Rs 300-Rs 1,000) every month. This was almost one-fourth of MTC’ss daily footfall. Distribution of both these passes was suspended after the bus fare hike in January 2018. But Rs 1,000 worth monthly pass scheme was revived a month later and since then it's average monthly sale increased from 50,000 to 80,000 per month.

Sale of other monthly concession passes (Rs 320 for 10km and Rs 370 for 15km) was also on the rise as it helped people save on commute expense. And then the government scrapped it. V Baskar, a collection agent from Nanganallur, said the pass was a great relief for him. “My job is to collect dues and clear orders from customers in Tambaram, Guindy and Vadapalani. Given the nature of my job, I can’t commute by train and I have to depend on buses and autorickshaws. Instead of spending Rs 50, I end up spending double the amount every day and this is one-third of what I earn,” he said.

MTC also reduced the frequency of buses plying along some suburban routes on which daily ticket collection was below par. T Sadagopan, a civic activist from Avadi, complained that MTC has stopped operating buses along B70 (Pattabiram-Guindy) route, and passengers from Avadi have to get a bus to either Ambattur or Vadapalani to reach Guindy. Without daily passes, passengers spend Rs 80-Rs 100 per day. That too none of these buses (plying towards Tambaram) enter Guindy Industrial Estate to drop passengers at the Ekkaduthangal CIPET traffic signal. One has to walk at least a kilometre to reach the estate from this bus stop, he said.

When the matter was taken to him an MTC official said the daily pass was suspended after they found out many started misusing it by sharing it with their friends. “It hasn't affected our patronage much,” he said.

CHENNAI: There has been a decline in road accident deaths in the state, but ambulances and emergency rooms are seeing more deaths. While ambulances recorded nearly 6,500 more deaths compared to 2018, nearly 100 more people died in the emergency departments of various state-run hospitals.Since 2016, Tamil Nadu is among the top in the country in road accidents. In 2019, the state counted 10,472 road accident deaths compared to 12,216 fatalities in 2018. During the same period, nearly 40,000 more trauma victims, including 2,650 more accident victims, were taken to government hospitals. While surgeries were done for more than three out of five patients and CT scans were done on two-fifths of the patients, at least 4% of patients admitted required blood transfusion .One of the reasons why there was increased work in emergency rooms is because many departments in the state worked together with organisations and institutions such as IIT-M to locate accident hot spots, identify faulty road designs and causes for accidents, said transport commissioner S Jawahar said at a meeting in New Delhi recently, where TN was given an award for bringing down accident deaths. Overall, the number of high velocity accidents has also declined in the state, he said.The state 108 ambulances outsourced to GVK-EMRI picks at least 100 cases of trauma every day from across the state. “Sometimes accident victims are inside the ambulance for more than an hour either because of traffic or because the nearest state facility is that far. Some die on their way to hospital,” said EVK EMRI state head M Selvakumar.An audit by the health department revealed that more than 70% of accidents happened on 8% of roads, particularly highways, and deaths happened because accident victims were not able to reach hospitals and receive basic first aid. To reduce travel time, the state has set up five seven bed emergency and trauma centres equipped with ventilators, defibrillators and other lifesaving equipment, besides doctors and nurses on duty round the clock. “These centres within 10 minutes of the accident spot acts as a hub before the patient is taken to a tertiary centre,” he said.At the tertiary care centre patients are given treatment free of cost. They can move to private hospital empanelled under the state health insurance scheme and continue free treatment.Officials at the EMRI and emergency medicine experts at government hospitals agree that they have to do more to bring down deaths. “As per the protocol, ambulance technicians must alert a staff nurse before arrival. This pre-arrival intimation helps us keep a team ready for the critically ill.

272,['20/01/2020'],Architects’ body objects to revamp of Central Vista,"This story is from January 20, 2020

NEW DELHI: A national body of architects has objected to the DDA ’s proposal of changing land use (CLU) of 80.5 acres for the Central Vista revamp, which includes concentration of more government offices in the area, claiming such a move violates Delhi Master Plan provisions. It also said there were no details of compensatory allocation of land for recreational/public and semi-public use, which would be “lost”.

Citing the Master Plan provision, the northern chapter of Indian Institute of Architects (IIA) claimed the policy document said no new central government office should be located in Delhi. It quoted the Master Plan, which says, “As per NCR Plan, no new central government and public sector undertaking offices should be located in NCTD. However, the issue of shifting existing government/PSU offices from Delhi as well as restricting the setting up of new offices would only be possible after a time-bound action plan is prepared together with suitable incentives and disincentives.”

In its letter to the DDA, which is responsible for CLUs, the IIA requested the authority to make the details public before going ahead. It claimed the changes “seem to be conflicting with the Master Plan of Delhi-2021”. It also sought details of any study done to assess the impact of additional pedestrian and vehicular traffic that the CLUs will generate.

The DDA’s CLU proposal indicates that the new residence of the PM is likely to come up on a 15-acre plot located north of Dalhousie Road near South Block. TOI on Thursday had first reported how the government may continue earmarking 7, Lok Kalyan Marg, the current resident of the PM, as PM’s House in addition to the proposed one considering security reasons.

Earlier, urban affairs ministry officials had said transport and traffic movement plan in this zone were being worked out. They had said the government may consider staggering office timings and even increase the frequency of Metro trains besides creating more public space after completion of the project.

Sachin Upadhayay

DEHRADUN: Sachin Upadhyay, brother of former Uttarakhand Congress president Kishore Upadhyay and owner of an upscale club in the city, was arrested for not cooperating with the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing a forgery case filed against him by his business partner Mukesh Joshi. The arrest was made after a district court issued a non-bailable warrant against Upadhyay.

Police sources told TOI that Sachin Upadhyay was produced before a magistrate, who sent him to a 14-day judicial custody. Later, he was taken to Rajpur police station for interrogation.

Confirming the development, Garhwal’s Inspector General (IG) Ajay Rautela told TOI, “Sachin Upadhyay was arrested after a district court issued a non-bailable warrant against him in a forgery case.” The official added that the name of Nazia Yusuf Izuddin (Upadhyay’s wife) has also come up in the investigation and she would also be called for questioning by the SIT.

Both Nazia and Sachin could not be reached for comments. However, when TOI asked Kishore Upadhyay about the developments, he said, “You must ask CM Rawat. Why an SIT was set up and why a non-bailable warrant was issued? And that, too, on a Sunday! Were we running away from the probe? No, but still my family is being hounded.” The Congress leader added that he has also been named in the complaint.

Meanwhile, state BJP leaders distanced themselves from the developments saying that the “law is taking its course” and that they won’t comment on the matter as it is sub-judice. Notably, Upadhyay and Joshi had set up a company “SM Hospitality” in Dehradun in 2006 but later had a fallout.

In an FIR registered in 2017, Joshi had alleged that Upadhyay forged his signature and transferred the company’s ownership to his wife Nazia. The couple also took a loan of Rs 35 crore from a bank on the basis of the forged ownership document, Joshi's complaint had alleged.

Tasmac sold liquor worth Rs 175 crore on Kaanum Pongal

CHENNAI: It wasn’t just the Pongal pot that frothed over in Tamil Nadu last week when tipplers opened the bottle, taking Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (Tasmac) revenue to Rs 610 crore in three days. This was a 10% jump in revenue compared to the 2019 Pongal season.

The state-owned marketing corporation registered record sales on January 14 and 17; January 16 was a dry day on account of Tiruvalluvar Day. Officials said Wednesday (January 15) registered the peak sale with liquor outlets across the state collecting Rs 250 crore. Tamil Nadu has about 5,200 Tasmac shops, 300 of them in Chennai. On Friday (Kaanum Pongal), Tasmac sold 175 crore worth of liquor, and on Tuesday (Bhogi) it garnered Rs 180 crore. It is higher than the usual weekend per day sales, which is between Rs 90 crore and Rs 100 crore. The value of weekday sale all over Tamil Nadu is pegged at Rs 60 crore.

Districts in Madurai and Trichy regions collectively recorded sales of Rs 250 crore in three days. The share of Chennai region comprising Chennai, Chengalpet, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts was only Rs 105 crore during the period. “Sales and revenue increased at least by 10% his Pongal season over the last. Chennai registered lower sales probably because people travelled from the city to their native towns and villages during the festival,” said a Tasmac official.

The collective sale during this Pongal was higher than last year’s Diwali season as well. The corporation recorded a sales of ₹455 crore between October 25 and 27 in 2019.

275,['20/01/2020'],Devotees to get 1 free Tirupati laddu from today,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Tirupati: Starting Monday, one Tirupati laddu will be issued free of cost to devotees on pilgrimage to the sacred abode of Lord Venkateswara at Tirumala.

On December 31, 2019, the temple administration had announced that it would issue one laddu free of cost to every devotee visiting the temple, beginning January 20. This decision is being set into action with the launch of ‘one free Tirupati laddu for every devotee scheme’ at the Tirumala temple, from Monday.

Speaking to TOI, TTD’s additional EO AV Dharma Reddy said that a free laddu would be issued to every devotee, regardless of whether they were a VIP or common devotee. “All devotees are equal before the almighty and everyone will be entitled to receive one free Tirupati laddu once they complete darshan,” he said.

The additional EO also clarified that the temple administration was not hiking the price of the laddu. “The price for one laddu is still Rs 50. We have just decided to cancel the issuance of laddus at subsidised prices,” he clarified.

Till recently, TTD provided free laddus only to divya darshan devotees daily. For others, the laddus were sold at subsidised prices. With the new scheme, the temple administration will have done away with these subsidies, which had also led to a black market business thriving at the temple town.

According to temple sources, even after issuing one free laddu to every devotee, the temple administration will save Rs 250 crore per annum by removing the subsidies.

Additionally, availing additional laddus has also become easier. Devotees can now buy additional laddus from counters adjacent to where they get the one free laddu. TTD has set up 12 new additional laddu prasadam token counters, where devotees can purchase the additional laddus by paying Rs 50 per laddu.

Intro: With parks doubling up as study zones for Secunderabad students, TOI asked readers what other facilities should be introduced in Secunderabad parks

Question: What other facilities should be introduced in Secunderabad parks?

Most of the parks lack drinking water, toilets and equipment to exercise. It is a good move by the GHMC officials to install permanent chairs for students preparing for various competitive exams, but due to lack of space, they cannot provide adequate number of chairs. I request the state government and GHMC to construct more parks. A few parks must be developed exclusively for students.

Nandikanti Sai Kumar

Maintaining the parks and attracting people must go hand in hand.

If we want to more kids, elderly and fitness-conscious people to visit parks, the authorities should maintain the green cover with timely pruning of overgrown shrubs and trees. A well-maintained walkway is also a must. Toilets have to be user-friendly and must also have a baby feeding room so that new mothers can use them. Parks with play area should have sand pits so that kids are not hurt while playing. All slides, see-saw and other equipment should be taken care of on a regular basis. Vigilance by security personnel is an add-on so that people do not tamper with public property and booked for wrongdoing. A small shop that can rent out balls, frisbees, rings, etc on a rental basis should be made available so that people can use the park for physical activity.

Yoga sessions and laugh clubs should be introduced in the mornings so that people can enjoy quality time with like-minded people in a beautiful ambience.

Deepesh Surana

Libraries, museums, community centres and performance sites open the doors to knowledge and ideas, culture and enjoyment. Medical facilities promote and protect health, and public transport offers access to transportation and other areas. Without them and other social services, life can be difficult, especially for those who cannot afford to travel.

Most communities, even small rural communities, have at least one public park and some other community facilities - a library, a hospital or clinic, a small museum or historic site. Improving these facilities can mean different things for different communities. For some, the problem maybe that proper parks or facilities simply aren't available, and they need to be built. For others, existing facilities may be outdated, and talk only about the needs of the community that has long since changed. Still others can find themselves with amenities that are appropriate in some ways, but they need to be revived. A less obvious situation is one in which the community facilities are in good shape and seem appropriate, but are not in use.

Syed Shamsuddin Maghrabi

Unlike Hyderabad, Secunderabad does not have many parks and needs more parks. When the authorities start redeveloping the abandoned areas, parks must be a top priority. Marredpally, Padmaraonagar, Seethaphalmandi, Sindhi Colony, Bowenpally and Kompally need more parks and bigger parks. The existing parks are small and cannot cater to the fast growing population in these places.

Cleanliness is top priority and much needed. Visitors must be educated to not dirty the place, with proper signboards and posters at the entrances. Good working equipment for Children to play safely and a proper infrastructure are required. Strict vigilance is also needed in the parks. All nefarious activities like youth consuming alcohol, prostitution, hooliganism, crime, are taking place. New Staff have to be hired and volunteers need to be deployed. The present staff of municipal authorities and other civic bodies is inadequate and cannot ensure the upkeep and above stated things.

Ramesh Vemuganti

The parks in Secunderabad are not only inadequate but many of them lack basic facilities, as a result, it has driven many of them to stroll on roads instead of relaxing in parks. As many places in Secunderabad earmarked for parks years ago are still lying in a shambles or have turned into a dumpyard in the absence of any maintenance work, the GHMC must not only take up on priority basis development of parks but specifically allot places for ‘children’s play area’ and a separate enclosure for outdoor games like shuttle, badminton and tennikoit. In addition, the GHMC can construct a small building and allocate separate rooms for indoor games besides establishing a small library for recreation. Above all, flowering plants all around the park and a landscape inside the park will not only enhance beauty of the park but ensure a serene atmosphere.

Government Doon Medical College Hospital

DEHRADUN: Orthopaedic transplants and certain other operations are not being conducted in Government Doon Medical College Hospital (GDMCH) for three days now after GDMCH doctors found out that the medical equipment to be used in the surgeries were sub-standard in quality.

Sunil Verma (name changed) was supposed to be operated at Doon Hospital last Wednesday but his operation was postponed after the ortho-surgeon at GDMCH found implant instruments to be of sub-standard quality. Verma told TOI that he had come to Dehradun from Pauri especially for the operation.

“I came to Dehradun and arranged for an accommodation for my family. But my operation was postponed due to inferior quality equipment. I wasn’t even given another date for my operation. We have been left in the lurch,” he alleged.

Notably, GDMCH principal Dr Ashutosh Sayana has now tasked “Ayushman Mitras” with ensuring that all the equipment are approved by the doctor prior to an operation. According to GDMCH sources, around eight operations have been halted as doctors complained of sub-standard quality of equipment and implants.

Meanwhile, Dr Sayana told TOI that a meeting was held between doctors and the third party agency that supplies operational instruments and implants. In the meeting, it was decided that they will be taking a pre-approval of their product from the doctors before surgery. “The third party agency has been warned against supplying sub-standard equipment and Ayushman Mitras have been assigned the responsibility to coordinate with patients and doctors so that such incidents do not take place in the future,” said Dr Sayana, while adding that orthopaedic operations will be conducted at the hospital from Monday onwards.

A team of doctors and junior employees has also been constituted under the supervision of a doctor to keep strict vigil on touts and middlemen inside the hospital, the principal added.

Tirupati: The Handicraft exhibition 2020, conducted jointly by the Union ministry of textiles and the state department of tourism and culture under the banner of The Andhra Pradesh Shilparamam Arts, Crafts and Cultural Society, began at Shilparamam (Urban Haat) here on Sunday.

The expo was launched by P G Neetha, in-charge assistant director (handicrafts), Union ministry of textiles, in the presence of B Jayaraj, chief executive officer of AP Shilparamam.

There are various handicraft items from seven states at the exhibition. Rosewood products from Karnataka are a hit among visitors, followed by Chennapatna wooden toys, a proud symbol of workmanship from the same state. Terracota earthen products brought by a team of artisans from Puducherry are sure to catch one’s attention.

Telangana is represented by Pochampally products known for their inimitable weaves, and the stall containing hand embroidery work from Delhi was mobbed by women.

The host state is represented by weavers and artisans of Pedana Kalamkari, Venkatagiri saris and Narsapur crochet lace work. These apart, the artificial jewellery stalls from Delhi and Tamil Nadu are hard to miss for the women, while those on stone craft, earthen art and brassware are a must-visit for connoisseurs of fine art.

“Such expos provide the right platform for the artisans to reach out to the art-loving citizens and the direct access to the right customer at a reasonable price. Our intention is to save our age-old cultural heritage from possible extinction and to pass on the traditional knowledge to future generations”, said Jayaraj.

The society has eight Shilparamam parks in Visakhapatnam, Tirupati, Kadapa, Pulivendula, Anantapuramu, Puttaparthi, Vizianagaram and Kakinada, while new parks are proposed at Guntur (under construction), Srikakulam, Kurnool, West Godavari, Krishna, Prakasam, Nellore, Vempalli and Idupulapaya (both in Kadapa). The existing parks would be upgraded and developed to transform them into vibrant tourist hubs, he added.

The expo ends on January 28.

NASHIK: A 39-year-old vehicle transporter, en route to Malegaon from the Mumbai side, was robbed of his pick-up vehicle by three armed robbers in the Malegaon Chhavani area, about 100 km from Nashik, on Saturday morning.

The Malegaon Chhavani police said they have registered a robbery case against the three suspects. The police said the complainant is in the business of transporting new pick-up vehicles from Mumbai to various destinations across the country and even Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal etc.

On Saturday, the complainant was driving a pick-up vehicle, which he was supposed to deliver to a certain location in north India. At 7 am, the complainant stopped in Tehere village along the Mumbai-Agra highway near Malegaon. At the same time, three men in a silver van approached him. One of them told the complainant to take the other two men with him and drop them off in Malegaon. The suspect even took out a firearm and held it to the complainant’s forehead. His two accomplices slapped the complainant.

However, the complainant managed to snatch the firearm from the first suspect and started running towards a nearby petrol pump to seek help. He left his pick-up behind. The three suspects then decamped with the vehicle.

In his FIR, the complainant said that the new pick-up vehicle was worth Rs 5.50 lakh. The complainant said he also lost valuable kept in the vehicle — a cellphone and Rs 10,000 in cash. The vehicle also had insurance papers of 10 other vehicles, his Aadhar and PAN cards and other documents. The Malegaon Chhavani police said that they were investigating the case.

TimesView That the much-hyped bus priority lane has all but vanished is a grim reminder of how mere enthusiasm is no substitute to perseverance. Setbacks are nothing new in ambitious civic initiatives, but more important is the lessons one learns. Thankfully, the agencies involved are determined to persist with the endeavor. They will hopefully pay more attention to the immediate needs: Strict enforcement and demarcation of lanes.

BENGALURU: The city’s first bus priority lane on Outer Ring Road appears to have all but vanished. With poor enforcement by traffic police and absence of a physical barricade along the busy stretch, buses are getting priority on the lane as a matter of exception and not as a rule.The ambitious project was rolled out by agencies like BBMP, BMTC , traffic police and the directorate of urban land on November 15. But in just about two months, the yellow marking demarcating the lane has faded away on several sections.Though BBMP had promised deployment of marshals on the stretch, hardly anyone is seen, prompting activists and experts to demand stringent action against violators.The road’s extreme left is reserved for BMTC buses on the 12-km ORR corridor between KR Puram and Iblur. Earlier, the bus lane was to run for 20km between SV Road near Byappanahalli and Central Silk Board Junction, but the 12-km stretch was implemented on a pilot basis.BBMP commissioner BH Anil Kumar said they will soon put up plastic bollards along the stretch. “We are planning to extend the bus priority lane till Byappanahalli. We are closely monitoring progress of the project and it will not fail,” he asserted.However, BBMP had earlier put up both plastic and metal bollards on ORR. While plastic bollards were damaged in an accident, metal bollards were removed after it was found that they could pose danger to two-wheelers at night. In December last year, a survey conducted by BMTC had revealed that the speed of buses had improved during both peak and non-peak hours, thanks to the lane project.“The average travel time in the corridor has reduced after the bus priority lane. The biggest improvement is seen during evening peak hours. Travel time has reduced by 60% from Tin Factory to Silk Board and in the opposite direction by 33%,” the report said, adding: “The ridership on ORR has seen a consistent increasing trend since its launch.”At the #NimbusExpress Bus Yatra, held to promote bus priority lanes, BMTC managing director C Shikha had said their daily ridership had increased by 12,000 and journey time had come down by 16 minutes during peak hours.Srinivas Alavilli from Citizens for Bengaluru, which has been backing the project for a long time said, “There is huge support from the public for this project to succeed but government agencies appear to have disappointed us. Installation of bollards has been delayed and enforcement against violators has been poor.”“There is a big scope to further increase the speed and ridership on ORR,” a BMTC official admitted.Those violating bus lane are fined Rs 500 for the first offence and Rs 1,000 for subsequent violations.Traffic police teams of KR Puram, HAL, HSR Layout and Madiwala are responsible for enforcement. BMTC is also recording violations by motorists. However, traffic police have slapped fine only on a few motorists and most violate rules with impunity.

Representative image

BENGALURU: Educationists can vouch for Bengaluru’s openness to experiment with new pedagogies. Apart from hosting one of the highest number of international sc-hools in the country, the city now also has institutions that are trying to import the best pedagogies from places like Finland , Sweden and Denm-ark, whose education syste-ms enjoy global reputation.

Some schools in the city have adopted best practices from these countries even while sticking to Indian curriculum and boards in order to ensure the best of both worlds. The managements either source experts from these countries or send their school leaders there to understand the system and introduce it in their schools. The Delhi government, for instance, had sent its teachers to Finland.

Kunskapsskolan is an Indo-Swedish school off Sarjapur Road, which started in 2017. In collaboration with Swedish firm Kunskapsskolan Education Sweden AB, the school has adopted a methodology focusing on personalised education, where each student sets his or her own personal and academic goals. With help from a personal coach, a student is encouraged to find strategies to attain the goals. This allows the child to set his or her own pace for learning, a method practised in Sweden. The Swedish head of the school, Mats Rosen, coaches teachers to ensure the programme is implemented in its true spirit.

Chaman Bhartiya, a school that is expected to start in Bengaluru from the next academic year, has roped in a Scandinavian educationist, who draws inspiration from the schooling system in Denmark. “In Denmark, children are happy to go to school. Parents do not ask how well their children did in academics. Instead, they ask how kind the child was and does he/she socialise with other children, among others. However, Indian students are better in academics. So, in the new school, we hope to take the best of both worlds,” said Allen Kjaer Andersen, director for the project.

The management of PNC Cognitio School that is affiliated to Cambridge Assessment International Education sent its top school leaders to Finland. “Our school leaders realised the biggest strength of Finland was in its teachers. We also decided to invest more on our teachers with resource time for them every single day and also on two Saturdays a month... The happiness quotient in Finland’s schools and the trust quotient students have are major takeaways,” said Nagesh LS, director.

A group of experts, however, are sceptical and say it’s not possible for Indian schools to completely adopt and do justice to these foreign systems. “A few visits will not help teachers completely understand and emulate the system. It will be like taking an engine of a Rolls Royce and trying to fit it in an old car,” said one expert.

AGRA: Following lack of proper monitoring, e-toilets set up at Purani Mandi and Basai Chowki in Fatehabad Road six months ago, under the smart city project, are yet to commence operations.

According to sources, miscreants have also stolen faucets, electric fittings, wash basins and other parts from the toilets at these places. The lock of one the toilets has also been broken at Fatehabad Road.

The e-toilets are portable, eco-friendly and hygienically maintained with a GPRS-enabled system. These toilets work on a sensor-based technology. They have a self-cleaning and water conservation mechanism. These are unmanned toilets with automated access control. Each block of e-toilet cost Rs 6 lakh. People were required to insert Rs 5 coin to use the e-toilet facility.

While the ones set up at Purani Mandi, Basai Chowki on Fatehabad Road and at Tajganj are yet to become operational, some of the e-toilets that were set up in Jalkal Land on Mughal Pulia, Trident crossing, Jaypee Hotel and Bijlighar do not function on a regular basis due to lack of full-time water supply.

According to locals, the e-toilets at Basai Chowki are being used by vendors to exhibit their products while the space around the ones at Purani Mandi are being used for parking vehicles, .

Nodal officer-in-charge of the Agra smart city project RK Singh said, “Due to some issues related to land and water connection, the operation of these e-toilets has been delayed. Now, the matter has been sorted out. The e-toilets at Purani Mandi and Fatehabad Road will be opened by January-end.”

Bird injured by Chinese manjha in Haridwar

HARIDWAR: Recent incidents, in which two wild owls suffered injuries and a man in Jwalapur received injuries in the neck and had to be admitted to ICU, have rekindled the controversy over sale of Chinese manjha in the district. Locals contend the abrasive kite strings made in China, which are non-biodegradable, have become a serious threat to humans as well as wildlife in Haridwar , as the district administration and police have failed to act against its sale, even after NGT banned it across the country in 2017.

Flying kites in winter is a popular pastime in Haridwar. Despite repeated complaints by locals, authorities are yet to clamp down on sale of the dangerous Chinese manjha, which is made of monofilament fishing line coated with deadly sharp glass shards. It is also non-biodegradable, making it dangerous for the environment, especially water bodies where it eventually ends up. Across Haridwar, Chinese manjha is selling openly.

Activist J P Badoni, himself a victim of Chinese manjha, told TOI, “Despite the ban, anybody can buy Chinese manjha from the market. I had complained to the city magistrate to issue an order against this, but after no action was taken, I filed an application with the district magistrate. He too is yet to take any action. The only option left before me is to file a suit in the court. It’s unfortunate our agencies are not performing their duties according to law.”

Domestic and wild animals and birds are among the biggest victims of Chinese manjha. Several birds have been rescued by the forest department recently bearing wounds from Chinese manjha.

Divisional forest officer, Haridwar, Akash Verma told TOI, “It’s very dangerous for wild animals and birds. We rescued several birds so far. Last week, we rescued two wild owls trapped in Chinese manjha, both of which lost their wings. We have no power to take action against shopkeepers who sell the deadly material.”

Contrary to the ground reality, police claimed action is being taken. Haridwar SSP Senthil Abudai Krishna Raj S told TOI, “We’re taking action against sellers of Chinese manjha as per rules. We also imposed penalty, and strict action will be taken against those violate the rules.”

NEW DELHI: If you want to see monuments like Kashi Vishwanath temple, Taj Mahal and Hampi temple without travelling to where they are located, then visit National Museum where their specially crafted 3D models will be on display for a month.

The interactive models of five important heritage sites titled “ViRaasat” have been developed by Vizara technologies, a startup at IIT-Delhi’s incubation centre. The installations are an exact replica of the original monuments developed through laser scan data. “We developed them by taking government data and creating 3D and digital models,” said Anupama Mallik, CEO and MD of Vizara technologies.

The five monuments include Kashi Vishwanath temple, Taj Mahal, Sun Temple of Konark , Vijaya Vitthala Temple of Hampi, Sita Ramachandraswamy temple at Bhadrachalam and Rani ki Vav at Patan.

“Along with a bird’s eye view, one can have a virtual walkthrough of the structures. You can use a laser pointer to draw a path on the physical model and a screen behind will show the camera movement, thereby giving a personal tour,” said Mallik.

Users can also take a tour through voice command. “You can ask Alexa to move in the pathway of the monuments, go up or down and change the time of the day. We have also provided a game controller or console for users to move around the monuments,” Mallik said.

In the Kashi Vishwanath model, a tablet has been placed to show a video of the chosen particular spot. Mallik said, “These miniature structures will excite tourists. The models give an aerial view of the monuments, which people generally don’t get to see. The beauty of the structures can be appreciated through these replicas.”

Visitors can also see 10-minute video shows of Taj Mahal and Kashi Vishwanath temple giving the history and an insight into the monuments.

Pritam Singh

DEHRADUN: With former chief minister Harish Rawat on a three-month break from active politics, state Congress unit will have to wait some more for the selection of party’s new committee.

A party insider told TOI that the new committee could not be selected as some leaders are accusing others of ignoring Rawat. “The party is yet to announce new district chiefs of Tehri and Udham Singh Nagar as well. These posts had become vacant around three years ago but they have not yet been filled. How can we become strong on grass-root level if such key positions remain vacant,” said a Congress functionary.

Earlier in December 2019, Congress had dissolved its committee and the new one was to be announced in January, 2020. Pritam Singh was heading the last Congress committee since party’s 2017 assembly poll debacle. However, Singh had to work with the team formed by his predecessor Kishore Upadhyay.

The previous committee had 28 vice presidents, 28 general secretaries, five secretaries, a chief spokesperson, 21 special members, and 21 executive committee members.

Meanwhile, former party spokesperson Mathura Dutt Joshi has denied all reports of internal bickering among senior state leaders. “The new committee has been approved and it would be announced soon. Our senior leaders, including Harish Rawat and Pritam Singh, have worked very hard to strengthen the party in the Himalayan state,” said Joshi.

AGRA: A 32-year-old lawyer was allegedly shot dead and his wife sustained serious injuries on her head after the couple was attacked and fired upon by nephews following a heated argument over a property dispute in Aligarh’s Karpuri Nagar on Sunday.

According to police, advocate Vedprakash died on the spot, while his wife, Kavita, 28, who tried to intervene sustained bullet injuries on the left side of her skull. She was rushed to JN medical college, where her condition is said to be critical.

Station house officer of Kawarsi police station, Vinod Kumar, said that the incident occurred around 10:30 am, when the deceased’s nephews, Himanshu and Dheeraj, reached their uncle’s house to reportedly demand their Rs 40,000 share in connection with the property, where he was staying.

After a heated argument, the duo, who were carrying pistols, fired two shots at Vedprakash and when his wife tried to save her husband, the accused shot at her too and fled from the house. Vedprakash’s body had two bullet injuries, one each at his back and right side of the face. His body has been sent for postmortem.

An FIR has been registered against Himanshu and Dheeraj under sections 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), 302 (murder) and 307 (attempt to murder) of IPC on a complaint filed by Vedprakash’s brother.

The RTO has issues final notices to the vehicle owners concerned

AGRA: In a bid to curb pollution in the eco-sensitive Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ), some 45,000 vehicles which are 15 years or more will be taken off the roads in Agra . The regional transport office (RTO) has decided to cancel the registration certificate of all these vehicles.

In this regard, the RTO has issued final notices to the vehicle owners concerned. The RTO is going to cancel the registration certificate of these vehicles on February 16. Thereafter, vehicles purchased before March 2004 found operating on the roads will be seized and dismantled as their emission levels are high.

According to RTO officials, no further extension of registration of these vehicles will be done. However, those who wish to transfer their vehicles to any other district in the country will be allowed to do so by taking a no-objection certificate (NOC) by February 15, they added.

Anil Kumar, regional transport officer (administration), said, “Soon registration of all vehicles operating since March 2004 or earlier will be cancelled. Final notices have been issued to the owners of the pollution- causing vehicles. After this, such vehicles found operating in Agra will be seized and dismantled. Besides, their owners will be penalized. There is no scope for any relaxation in the rule, especially in Agra district, a major part of which lies in the eco-sensitive Taj Trapezium Zone.”

In 2018, the Union ministry of road transport and highways, had banned operations of 10-year-old diesel vehicles and 15-year-old petrol vehicles in the National Capital Region (NCR) and TTZ, that spans a 10,400 sq km comprising over 40 protected monuments, including three World Heritage sites -- Taj Mahal , Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri. So far, the transport authorities have not been able to enforce the ban. The TTZ covers Agra, Mathura, Firozabad, Hathras and Etah districts in UP and a part of Bharatpur district in Rajasthan.

The registration series which is proposed to be cancelled include UP 80 A to Z, AA, AB, AC and AD, an RTO official said.

He added, “Owners of vehicles which are 15 years or more old have an option to transfer them to some other district by obtaining an NOC. Some of the locals have already got their vehicles registered in Mainpuri and Etawah or nearby states, where the rule is not applicable. Once the registration is cancelled, the vehicle will be of no use.”

CM Uddhav Thackerey

NASHIK: The indefinite bandh that had been called by the residents of Shirdi — to protest against the state government announcing Pathri, in Parbhani district , as Saibaba’s birthplace — was called off temporarily after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray agreed to hold a dialogue on Monday.

“We did not object to the Rs 100-crore aid being given to Pathri village . Our objection was to terming the village as Saibaba’s birthplace. Therefore, the entire business community and the residents of the region had joined the protest. After the CM assured us of a meet on Monday, we called off the bandh,” Nitin Kote, who is spearheading the agitation, said. Kote, however, added that the outcome of Monday’s meeting would decide their future course of action.

Business establishments — including hotels, restaurants and shops — in Shirdi and 25 other surrounding villages in Ahmednagar district had remained closed on Sunday in response to the indefinite bandh called by the residents of the pilgrim town. In fact, Sadashiv Lokhande, the Sena MP from Shirdi, too had backed the bandh going against the party line.

“I am completely with the people of this town and pilgrims. I will speak to the chief minister (Thackeray) to find a solution to the issue,” he had said addressing a gathering on Sunday. Former MLA Snehalata Kolhe, Shiv Sena leaders Kamlakar Kote, Sujit Gondkar, Sena city unit president Sachin Kote and others were also present in the rally.

At 10 am, the Shirdi residents had taken out a ‘Sab Ka Malik Ek’ rally from the Dwarkamai temple. All shops, establishments and local autorickshaws joined the bandh and many pilgrims were even unable to buy offerings for Saibaba. “When we come here, we like to make offerings to Saibaba. We thought we would get them here, but because everything is closed, all we could do was visit the shrine,” said Shivkumar Reddy, a devotee from Hyderabad.

But the bandh did not affect the pilgrim numbers as the temple and its services remained open. The Shirdi Saibaba Sansthan Trust (SSST), which has 1,530 rooms, had full occupancy and there were many still looking for a place to stay. Office-bearers of the SSST said the number of pilgrims during the day was comparable to any given Sunday.

Commenting on the pilgrim situation on Sunday afternoon, the SSST officials said, “From Sunday evening onwards, the number of pilgrims staying in Shirdi usually drops. As of now, all the rooms are filled. However, more than 25% of the rooms will become vacant in the evening and we will be able to accommodate the pilgrims coming in.” The officials added that the SSST also provides meals to the pilgrims.

The Shirdi Municipal Council also tried to help out the pilgrims. “We have ensured that the pilgrims and tourists coming to the Shirdi town don’t face problems. We will provide free food to pilgrims till the government agrees to our demand,” said Archana Kote, president of the council.

296,['20/01/2020'],Sewage water causes road to cave in near Kharar,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Mohali: A road connecting Kharar with Bassi Pathana caved in after a sewer broke, leaving the residents on both sides disconnected, municipal corporation officials said on Sunday.

According to them, the sewage water being discharged from Kharar had been affecting the nearby villages for some time, after which the authorities decided to release the water. On Saturday, when the officials came with their JCB machines to check the underwater sewer and release it, the flow of the water became so much that it could not bear the pressure and the pipe burst, after which the road caved in.

According to the officials, the villagers there had deliberately blocked the pipe, due to which the water had reached the level of road. “To release the water on the other side and check the water flow, we went there with a JCB machine, but the pressure was so high that the underneath part of the road couldn’t bear it and the sewer burst,” said one of the officials.

“Within no time, part of the road caved in. Many fish are believed to have dies due to the contaminated water and the nearby villages are facing a tough time, also due to bad odour,” said Narinder, a resident of the nearby village.

Villagers said that now they would have to travel 6km more to reach Kharar via the Randhawa road. Incidentally, this is the shortest available route now. Police officials also rushed to the spot and closed to road to prevent any mishap.

Mohali DC Girish Dayalan said, “A committee has been constituted comprising officials from different departments concerned, including the Kharar MC executive officer, to assess the loss and repair cost, and to draft a plan to find a lasting solution.”

In December last year, TOI had reported that villagers of four affected villages — Shergarh Barha, Kajal Majra, Main Majri and Nandpur Kalaur — had been pressing the administrations of Mohali and Fatehgarh Sahib to find a solution to stop the flow of water from Kharar treatment plant into their fields. Row Political commotion over toxic water flowing into fields of four villages due to an illegal dam on Satluj Yamuna Link (SYL) Canal near Kharar was put to rest after demolishing the same, thus allowing the treated water to flow further into the canal.

Overflowing water was falling into Jainti Ki Rao and entering agricultural land of low-lying villages of Shergarh Barha, Kajal Majra, Main Majri and Nandpur Kalaur destroying the standing crop.

297,['20/01/2020'],Karnataka politics: Fresh tension as Amit Shah moots only six cabinet berths for defectors,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Amit Shah

BENGALURU: The suspense over chief minister BS Yediyurappa expanding his council of ministers is set to continue until after he returns from his trip to attend the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland.

Yediyurappa, who heads a 10-member delegation to the Swiss ski resort, left on Sunday. Prior to his departure, he told reporters cabinet expansion will happen only after his return on January 24. “I discussed the issue with [BJP] national president Amit Shah for 30 minutes or so. He has given a positive response and I will expand the cabinet within two days after my return,” Yediyurappa said.

But sources said Shah, during his visit to Hubballi on Saturday, had indicated the exercise is likely to be delayed further as the central leadership will be busy with the assembly elections in Delhi. “Indications are there is no possibility of expanding the cabinet until February 11 when the electoral process for the Delhi elections ends,” said a source.

The development has obviously left ministerial aspirants, especially defectors from Congress and JD(S) who were re-elected on BJP tickets last month, restive. Moreover, while Yediyurappa has promised ministerial berths to all MLAs who switched to the BJP from Congress and JD(S), sources say Shah is only in favour of inducting six defectors (11 of whom won MLA seats on saffron party tickets in the byelections) into the cabinet.

“Shah’s advice to Yediyurappa is to strike a balance between defectors and loyalists. His concern is loyalists should not be left disappointed, while justice should be served to the defectors as well,” said a BJP functionary.

Meanwhile, KS Eshwarappa, senior party functionary and minister for rural development, said the BJP would never let down the defectors. “The party is indebted to them and I am sure they will all be rewarded,” he said.

BC Patil, one of the defectors, said some of them had met Shah in one-on-one meetings in Hubballi. “It was more a courtesy call and the issue of cabinet expansion didn’t come up during the meeting,” he said.

The organisers plan to hold a similar event in the city next month (Bangalore Mirror image)

BENGALURU: Dozens showed up at Modi Masjid in Tasker Town on Sunday morning after the 170-year-old mosque opened its doors to men and women of all faiths , inviting them to visit and learn more about Islam.

The visitors were taken on a tour of the masjid and various postures of prayer were demonstrated by the organisers. They were told about the teachings and practices in Islam and verses from the Quran were recited. A Q&A session where members of non-Muslim communities voiced their doubts, besides a meditation session, were also held as part of the event. Visitors were given a copy of the Quran to browse through.

The open invitation,‘Visit My Mosque’, to understand Islam better, was issued earlier in the week by Mumbai-based charitable trust Rahmath Group to non-Muslim communities, through social media. The group organised a similar event at the mosque in the past for students of a Christian college.

“The masjid doors were opened to all fellow Indians, on Sunday. We planned such an event to bridge the gap between Muslim and non-Muslim communities. To this day, there continues to be a lot of misconceptions about Islam. This event was aimed at empowering all communities with more information about the Muslim community and try to answer any questions they may have,” said Sadiqh Sailani of Rahmath Group.

“The most common question people raised was regarding the status of women in Islam. People asked questions about Muslim women’s attire and many were of the misconception that women are oppressed. The status of women in Islam is very high and the clothes are more of a religious practice than a social obligation — we explained this to them. A few others raised questions about jihad as well,” said Sadiqh.

The mosque was named after Modi Abdul Gafoor, a 19th century merchant. Apart from this mosque, there are two more mosques are in Bengaluru known as Modi Masjid.

The organisers plan to hold a similar event in the city next month.

PANAJI: The Goa State Information Commission has recommended that the government take immediate steps to issue a notification to declare comunidades as ‘public authorities’ for the efficient functioning of the RTI act, and in the interest of maintaining transparency and accountability.“The administrator of the comunidade can be appointed as the First Appellate Authority (FAA) (instead of the additional collector) and the PIO can be escrivao/clerk of the respective comunidade,” stated the order passed by Juino De Souza, the state information commissioner.The commission observed that most comunidades function in a “secret manner without any transparency and accountability”, where information is withheld from the shareholders of the comunidades.“These bodies cannot be allowed to be looted and plundered under the garb of them being ‘gaunkari’ (community-run) or private entities. Even components of the comunidade, namely gaunkars and shareholders, are kept in the dark about the managing committee decisions regarding allotments of plots, open spaces, serventia and permissions granted by the respective comunidades,” De Souza stated in his order.The observations were passed while disposing of an appeal filed by a shareholder of Calangute comunidade, who was denied information, under RTI, about the minutes of the general body, ordinary and extraordinary meetings held during the tenure of the present managing committee of Calangute Comunidade.The commission came to the conclusion that that the PIO was not at fault as the PIO had made repeated attempts to obtain information from the comunidade of Calangute, but was not successful, because the comunidade of Calangute “is unwilling to furnish the information due to its claim that comunidade bodies are not public authorities and the PIO has no jurisdiction to call for private information”.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73396845,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-218684,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/declare-comunidades-as-public-authorities-for-rti-to-function/articleshow/73396845.cms

As many as 3,040 licences were suspended between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019. The figure was 5,645 for the preceding three years (from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018).Violations like speeding and drunken driving led to maximum licence suspensions. In the past four years, 3,046 licences were suspended for speeding and 2,755 for drunken driving.The analysis of 2019 data, however, reveals that jumping red-light led to maximum (936) suspension of licences, followed by speeding (814) and drunken driving (566).Traffic police said under Section 19 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, (read with Rule 21 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989), it had recommended to RLA to suspend driving licences for three to six months of those using cellphone while driving, jumping red light, speeding and mixing drinking with driving.With the implementation of amended Motor Vehicles Act in September last, driving without helmet attracted a fine of Rs 1,000 along with suspension of driving licence for three months. Earlier, only Rs 300 was charged for the offence.An RLA official said licences were also suspended for violations such as overloading goods vehicles, carrying passengers in goods carriages, triple riding and using pressure horns.UT traffic police had started sending online recommendations to RLA for suspension of driving licences of offenders in 2018.

MARGAO: Eighteen Indians held hostage by pirates off the coast of Benin in west Africa were released on Sunday. However, one among the four Goans — identified as Brito D’Silva from Ambelim—died in captivity. The other three Goans are reportedly safe, and are currently lodged in Lagos, Nigeria.

“It is being informed that Brito D’Silva one of the four #Goans seafarers from Ambelim kidnapped by #Nigerian #pirates dies under abduction. 18 seafarers have been released by pirates today. Demanding an inquiry into the matter,” commissioner for NRI affairs Narendra Sawaikar tweeted.

There’s no clarity about the circumstances leading to his death, Sawaikar told TOI. “One has to understand that he was among those held hostage by pirates. The (shipping) company was negotiating with the pirates for over a month for their safe release and I was being updated. However, we don’t know the nature or terms of those negotiations. I have demanded an inquiry, and I hope some clarity emerges,” he said.

Dixon Vaz of Goa Seamen’s Association of India told TOI that representatives of the shipping company had called on D’Silva’s family in Ambelim on Sunday morning and gave the tragic news.

D’Silva, Vaz said, was married just 7-8 months ago.

Demanding a thorough inquiry into D’Silva’s death, Vaz said that the family was informed that he died on December 23.

“We have learnt that all the kidnapped seafarers were kept confined at an isolated place deep in the forests. So how he died, whether he fell sick, etc, we don’t know. We are waiting for the arrival of the other three Goans who have been released today (Sunday) to reach home so that we get some clarity on the matter,” Vaz said.

The pirates had attacked the ship on December 15 in the international waters approximately 140 nautical miles from Lome, Tago.

Sawaikar had subsequently written to minister of external affairs S Jaishankar seeking his intervention for the expeditious release of the abducted seafarers. The Indian high commission in Abuja, Nigeria, had then written to Sawaikar stating that all the Indian nationals held hostage by the pirates off the coast of Benin in west Africa were safe and that contact had been established with the parties concerned to seek their early release.

303,['20/01/2020'],41 students from district score above 98% in JEE mains,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Nashik: Students from Nashik district performed exceptionally well in the Joint Entrance Examination ( JEE ) mains , the results of which were declared on Friday night.

Reports from various coaching classes and other sources indicate that as many as 41 students have scored above 98% in the exam conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA).

With 99.99%, Aditya Kudre is the highest scorer in the JEE mains from Nashik district. Among other students who secured above 98% are Reedam Dhake (99.89%), Pawan Bodke (99.84%), Prathak Kurkure (99.78%), Samyak Jain (99.76%), Shubham Pednekar (99.74%), Rutvij Gondkar (99.72%), Harshwardhan W (99.69%) and Anita Warungase (99.69%).

Without discrediting the hard work of the students, coaching experts attributed their success to the role teachers and parents played in the lives of the students during their preparation time.

“Students should stay away from social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram and realise that these are the most crucial two years of their lives. Parents should avoid buying smart phones for their wards. I have seen that in many cases, having a mobile phone turns out to be the biggest reason for a student’s failure,” said Vishwas Jain from GravIITy Academy.

Another expert pointed out that while students should take their studies seriously to achieve good results, he also advised other students, whose scores have fallen, to not be disheartened as there were many more avenues for them to explore.

“Students need not be disheartened if the results were not up to their expectations. Instead, they should start looking out for alternate opportunities the education sector has to offer and explore the areas which they can master,” said the expert.

You will be representing India in Davos. What’s on the agenda?

You are scheduled to meet US Trade Representative. Has the trade deal with the US been sealed or will you be giving it finishing touches?

What time frame do you have in mind?

There are reports of President

Donald Trump

coming to India next month…

Will you meet your Malaysian counterpart in Davos?

Your comments on Amazon’s investment have generated a lot of controversy and a day later you said that the statement should be seen in proper perspective...

When Competition Commission of India (CCI) is already looking into the issue, was there a need for the government to comment, especially when we are seeking investment, both domestic and foreign?

What are the findings of the ministry’s investigations?

In Amazon’s case, you and your officers have had meetings with their India team. Have the violations been pointed out to them?

Since it’s still under discussion, wouldn’t it have been prudent for you to wait for this to get over before making that statement (on Amazon)?

But isn’t that a global phenomenon where you have traditional retailers competing against companies with technology…

You have talked about import substitution of non-essential imports and on other fronts as well, which is seen to be protectionist. Does it send the right signal to investors, some of whom you will meet in Davos this week?

Amazon has said that their $1 billion investment will create a million jobs…

Is there scope for a further review of the regulations?

There is a perception that you are paying more attention to imports that exports. Is that a fair perception?

What will be your message to investors in Davos and elsewhere? Is India open for business?

NEW DELHI: Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal has raised the heat on e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Flipkart and asked them to ensure that their operations are completely in line with Indian regulations. In an interview ahead of his visit to Davos, he tells TOI that he is not being protectionist in his policies. Excerpts:This year, we have chosen the theme, Power of India. We believe India reflects the power of democracy, the power of demography, leadership, opportunity and talent. It encapsulates the rising relevance in the business world as we move towards a $5 trillion economy. It is a cusp after which economies tend to take over. Once you cross the $3,500-4,000 per capita income level, the momentum drives the economy. I have over 50 engagements and we will be engaged in several dialogues around the investment opportunity, sustainability, industry and manufacturing potential and we will be talking to several international leaders to further explore further explore trade and business opportunities inter se our friendly nations.We have six-member trade negotiating team coming to India next week. In the meantime I will have my dialogue with Ambassador Bob Lighthizer and I am sure we can work out the first part of a long-term relationship which we are working on.Trade issues are very complex, one must not rush them.Am not aware of that.I don’t see it in my calendar.I had categorically said that we welcome all FDI into the country but they have to work within the law of the land. India has a very clear policy that FDI is allowed in multi-brand retail trade only up to 49%. In e-commerce, up to 100% FDI is allowed, but in business-to-business (B2B). As I became the commerce and industry minister and I saw the number of retail stores that were closing down, the concerns of small retail in India, which are similar to concerns that many stakeholders have in America, we started going into the detail.We found that large e-commerce companies are not necessarily within the ambit of Indian law in totality. While they have found some loophole to demonstrate that they fit into the parameters set by various government circulars, the spirit of the law has not been recognised by these companies. India has thousands of foreign companies working in the country and all of them have a very pleasant experience working in the country. We also have a very pleasant experience since they work within the ambit of the law. E-commerce companies should also work within the ambit of the law.We are seeking investment into sectors, which are permitted. CCI has its mandate to look at fair business practices. When they ordered an investigation, they said they could clearly see that there was a flouting of equal opportunity to all sellers on that platform, they also said that they could see some restricted practices by sellers on these platforms... Complaints also led to find if there is violation of FDI policy, which is the mandate of the commerce and industry ministry. Many of the e-commerce companies have actually thanked me that we have done the investigation within the ministry and are giving a full opportunity to all these companies to respond instead of letting the investigations get into another track.That’s work in progress but certainly some of the findings are not very good, which prompted me to once again say what I have been saying for the last three-four months on several platforms. We will appreciate if all e-commerce companies work within the ambit of the law and don’t use loopholes to break the law and indirectly get into multi-brand retailing along with anti-competitive measures.My job is to explain what is permitted and what’s not permitted. I don’t conduct investigations. But my officers have certainly pointed out, based on the findings on the marketplace, through questionnaires (on) what we believe are the lacunae. Some responses have been received, which have confirmed that there are certain irregularities. However, we are giving more opportunities to the companies to present their case before the officials and will take a view on it after all the investigations and responses are received. We will also be very happy to guide them in case they have inadvertently been on the wrong side of the law.One can have a view on that. My effort is to raise the urgency of the issue also to the e-commerce companies. This is in the best interests of the country and all businesses that what they are doing should be fair and proper and not to the detriment of small retailers. It may not happen that just responding to our questions, or our giving an opportunity to fit into the law, we end up losing millions of jobs in the country and small retailers start closing down. The reports that I am getting on mobile stores, for example, are extremely disturbing. It’s reported that may be hundreds, may be, thousands of small retail stores have shut operations as they are unable to compete against giants. How will a small retailer with a few thousand rupees compete with giants who have deep pockets with billions of dollars?Technology is welcome. That’s we have opened e-commerce for B2B transactions, it’s not been opened up for B2C transactions. Each country will have to look after its own. Globally, countries don’t have such large population as India does. We have 60-70 million retailers, who have to pay interest on what they borrow and capital is scarce against global pools of capital which are huge and nearly at zero cost. This unfair competition was what was sought to be protected when the policy was made 20 years ago. It was opened up under the clear and explicit understanding that it will be B2B. If you introduce companies in between to convert the platform into a B2B platform and then serve the consumer through intermediaries which are also related parties, then it’s certainly a matter of concern.I am not looking at stopping any imports. Many imports are sub-standard, which are circumvention of country of origin rules, there are many countries which give equal and fair access to Indian products. Over the years, we have let loose a very liberal import regime. We are only trying to align ourselves with global best practices. For instance, the US has over 8,000 technical barriers to trade and sanitary and phyto-sanitary regulations, India barely has 500. China and Brazil also have higher regulations. I would like Indian industry to also engage with world class levels of quality, upgrade itself. There is also the question of ‘others’ category, if one-third or one-fourth of the products are categorised as others, as a nation we can’t plan without having data on what is being imported.We value the one million jobs that are going to be created but that should not be at the cost of several million jobs that may be lost because their focus only being on the supply side. As government, we have to focus on supply as well as the retail. While they are saying we have added so many suppliers, we are very happy, but their job as an e-commerce platform is to only connect suppliers with businesses. The retail end of it, the connect with the consumer, is with the retailer and if our retailers lose millions of jobs in the garb of creating 7 lakh jobs, I don’t think the country can afford to lose millions of retailers’ livelihood.We have never changed the law but only come out with clarifications through press notes, even e-commerce companies recognise this. Sadly, our clarifications have sought to be misused and structures sought to be created around those clarifications. In 2017-18, Amazon has declared losses of nearly $900 million. In a marketplace, where you are providing a platform for sellers to come and buyers to buy, I wonder how you can make losses of $900 million, upwards of Rs 6,000 crore. Somebody will have to justify how a marketplace, which is a technology platform, is making huge losses when technology is already available with them. The loss is more than their total revenue in the fifth or seventh year of operation. Clearly, there is an element of pricing control or predatory pricing. Something is not looking right.Both are equally important. My exporters are not getting a fair opportunity to be able to export. For example, steel is not getting open access in Japan and Korea, whereas Japanese and Korean steel are coming into the country. Export and import go hand in hand. I believe in reciprocal trade. If some country creates non-tariff barrier or creates a problem for my exports, then I will have to reciprocate. The message is very clear, wherever there is fair trade, we welcome it and we accept that with open arms. But unfair trade practices will not be accepted.Nobody has expressed any concern except some of our Indian companies. In Davos also I will be saying the same thing as I am telling you. There are thousands of companies, they are all good companies, they are all contributing to India’s GDP and creating jobs in India. But they are doing it within the ambit of law. If anybody wants to come into India and break the law, certainly it’s my job to take care of India’s interests.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73403843,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-293339,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/1-million-new-jobs-should-not-be-at-the-cost-of-several-million-jobs-piyush-goyal/articleshow/73403537.cms

Agra: Supreme Court lawyer Nizamuddin Pasha on Sunday said that the National Population Register (NPR) is nothing more than a procedural stage in the National Register of Citizens (NRC) for establishment of citizenship.

While delivering a lecture on CAA/NRC/NPR in AMU campus to educate its faculty members about the new law, he addressed the queries raised by AMU teachers and cleared their doubts. Pasha said that answer to the question whether it is constitutional or not can be decided only at the end when everything is done.

Explaining the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), Pasha said if non-Muslims from countries like Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan have arrived in India before December 31, 2014, they will be provided fast-track citizenship. This means that the person will just have to prove his/her presence by showing documents like electricity bill or telephone bill that establish their stay in India before December 31, 2014.

On the other hand, in Assam, people will have to prove that their ancestors were present in India prior to March 24, 1971. He said this highlighted lack of equality in treatment.

Organised by Aligarh Muslim University Teachers Association (AMUTA), the lecture was attended by a large number of teachers and the non-teaching staff. The varsity students and faculty rejected the CAA/NRC/NPR by dubbing it as ‘unconstitutional’ and demanded the government to withdraw the Act.

BENGALURU: An unidentified man who entered the second-floor flat of an apartment on Haralur Road in Bellandur through an open window , allegedly attempted to sexually assault a nine-year-old girl who was asleep. He fled after the child raised an alarm in the early hours of Saturday.

Bellandur police launched a manhunt for the accused.

According to police sources, the incident took place at 4.30am when the man entered the flat through the window. After entering the room where the girl was asleep, he opened the wardrobes and eventually slept next to the girl. He tried to undress her at which point she woke up and screamed for help.

The child’s parents sleeping in the next room rushed to her help, but the man jumped out of the window and took to his heels. The girl was in a state of shock and consoled by her parents. Around 10.30am, her father filed a police complaint.

Cops said they registered case under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012 and have CCTV footage from the Bellandur apartment.

Police said though the room was ransacked, no valuables were missing from the cupboards. They suspect the intruder might have been familiar with the apartment.

Amit Shah

BENGALURU: The government is hopeful the vexatious Mahadayi river water dispute with Goa, another BJP-ruled state, would be resolved during the budget session of Parliament commencing on January 31. The Supreme Court is also scheduled to begin hearing on the case the same day.

The hope stems from Union home minister and BJP national president Amit Shah meeting farmers of the river basin during his visit to Hubballi on Saturday. “The meeting assumes significance as it comes at a time when the Centre is seen to be favouring Goa for political reasons,” said Lokanath Hebsur, president of Mahadayi Kalasa-Banduri Horata Okkuta Kendra Samithi. “Shah’s meeting has definitely raised hopes.”

The Mahadayi tribunal had awarded 13.4tmcft water to Karnataka and had allowed the state to divert 5.5tmcft of it to the Malaprabha reservoir through Kalasa and Banduri canals. The state intends to use it to supply drinking water to Belagavi, Bagalkot, Dharwad and Gadag districts in North Karnataka . However, the award cannot be implemented until the Centre issues a gazette notification. The issue has been hanging fire for years now.

The state government hopes the Centre will get the Inter-State River Water Dispute (Amendment) Bill, 2019, passed in the Rajya Sabha during the budget session. This will automatically resolve several river water disputes, including the Mahadayi imbroglio, as it will remove the Centre’s role in implementing awards of tribunals. The bill has already been passed in the Lok Sabha.

“The bill could not be taken up in the winter session for various reasons. We will try to get approval of the upper house in the budget session,” said parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi.

Meanwhile, proceedings on the matter in the SC will also be keenly watched. While Karnataka has appealed for an additional 23tmcft of water, the state has also filed an interlocutory application seeking the court’s direction to the Centre to issue a gazette notification of the Mahadayi tribunal award.

“Issuing a gazette notification has nothing to do with the pending court case. Most of the work has been completed and the project can be implemented without delay,” said Lakshman Rao Peshwe, secretary to irrigation department. He said the government has already sent multiple reminders to the Centre on this. While civil work of Kalasa canal is almost completed, the government has to take up work of Banduri canal.

Meanwhile, advocate general Prabhuling K Navadagi has convened a meeting of lawyers and officials on January 27 in New Delhi to prepare for the court case. A senior lawyer said the priority is to get the court’s nod for gazette notification of the tribunal award.

MADURAI: Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre (MMHRC) on Sunday opened a department exclusively for fetal medicine , with an aim to to provide special and comprehensive care to fetuses by specialists, including obstetricians and geneticists.

“Providing comprehensive care for high-risk pregnancy and supportive neonatal intensive care is the primary objective,” said Dr S Padma, head of department of Fetal Medicine. For diagnosis, advanced high-resolution ultrasonography, an ultrasound-based imaging technique, will be used to pick up structural defects, neurological defects and cardiac defects.

“We go for specialized tests and care for the fetuses identified as high risk. We also give competent counselling for mothers carrying fetuses with the potential for genetic disorders and malformations. This helps mothers to understand and to make informed decisions on the medical options,” said Dr T Mukuntharajan, HOD, interventional Radiology.

The facility will be useful for couples opting for Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART)-based fertility treatments. “These days more and more couples are going for it. ART can increase the cases of triplets (three babies), and quadruplets (four babies). These multiple pregnancies have a very high chance of getting aborted. For a better pregnancy outcome well-equipped tertiary care centres are important,” said Dr S Gurushankar, Chairman, MMHRC. Following the inaugural event, the hospital also organized a one-day Continuing Medical Education (CME) program on foetal medicine, in association with Indian Medical Association, Madurai. CME attracted about 100 doctors from South Tamil Nadu .

<p>The bird was released in its natural habitat after its wounds healed well<br></p>

AGRA: A painted stork which was caught in a deadly kite ‘manja’ (thread) for several hours here was rescued by Wildlife SOS Rapid Rescue Unit. The right wing of the bird was injured and after medical treatment, it was set free .

The painted stork has been classified as “near threatened” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red list of Threatened species. It is found across large marshes of the sub-continent. Human-induced factors have led to the decline in their natural habitats and hence their intrusion into inhabitated areas by man.

According to Wildlife SOS members, they received a call on Friday on their helpline number about a wounded painted stork that had fallen into a restaurant courtyard. The stork had been circling above when a kite ‘manja’ cut through its wing. The bird was found by the restaurant owner, who immediately contacted Wildlife SOS for assistance. Two rescuers from the NGO rushed the spot and on examining the bird, found severe injuries on its wing.

Shivam Sharma, owner of restaurant, said, “Kids were flying kites in the neighbourhood and we saw the bird flying straight into a ‘manja’. It fell right into our courtyard and a closer look at the bird revealed that its wing was bleeding.”

Dr Ilayaraja, deputy director of veterinary services, Wildlife SOS, said, “There were multiple abrasions on the stork’s wing and the damage caused severe blood loss. As it was raining, we exercised extra caution to prevent infection of the wounds. Laser therapy with minimal handling helped to hasten the healing process. The bird was released in its natural habitat after its wounds healed well.”

According to NGO members, recently the Government of India has banned the production, storage and use of Chinese manja, making these actions punishable under the Environmental Protection Act, 1986, because of the threat it poses to birds.

Madurai: More than eight lakh children from Madurai, Dindigul, Theni, Virudhunagar, and Ramanathapuram districts were vaccinated for polio during the state-wide pulse polio immunisation drive held on Sunday.

Thousands of people queued up with their children below the age of five at primary health centres (PHCs), government hospitals and other special booths that were set up for this purpose. The respective collectors inaugurated the vaccination drives at one of the PHCs in their districts.

“We received good response this year, reaching out to more children than the target set. It could be because we reached a lot of migrant population who were here because of Pongal holidays and those visiting temples. We had teams covering high-risk areas as well with special care,” said Dr Priya Raj, deputy director of health services, Madurai.

Health workers, anganwadi workers, nursing students, social workers, and NGO volunteers administered the vaccines. Many transit and mobile teams were also arranged by the health department across districts to reach those at markets, temples, railway stations, toll gates, bus stations, refugee camps and slums.

Theekshna R, a resident of Vilakkuthoon took her 40-day-old child for polio vaccination. “We wanted to wait till next time as it would be difficult to carry the baby and wait in a queue. But, our doctor insisted on getting the vaccination done. Thankfully, when I went in the afternoon there was no crowd,” she said.

He along with the vice president Vajiullah has sent their resignations to Ejaz Deshmukh, the state unit president of the cell. “I have tried to put the message across the party and the leadership asking them to reconsider the demands and the feelings of the people of the community who feel the action by the central government was the anti-Muslim and less about the country on the whole,” he said.

He said the abrogation of Article 370 from Jammu And Kashmir and the division of the state was objected by the community. “The act making triple talaq a criminal act was seen as interference in the Muslim religion, the CAA excluded the Muslims from the neighbouring countries and the NRC were being seen steps towards isolation of the community,” he further said.

Polio survivor C Arulperunjothi (R) with his father

MADURAI: Even as the state-wide pulse polio vaccination drive was in full swing on Sunday, a student from a corporation school in Madurai became a grim reminder of how polio can hamper lives and family.

Polio survivor Arulperunjothi C is a Class X student at the Elango Corporation Higher Secondary School in Madurai and is all set to write the board exams this year. “My wife and I had our son nearly 20 years after our marriage. We were not well educated. One day our boy seemed to lose the ability to walk. We went to a doctor but he said our child will soon learn to walk. But, it didn’t get better,” recalled Chinnakaruppuviru C, Arul’s father.

By the time the family found out about Arul’s condition, doctors told them that their son may start losing his speaking ability as well. “I had to take him to a hostel when he was in Class IV. We don’t even have ration cards to avail benefits. Finally, I managed to buy a television set for Rs 2,000 and made my son watch Ramayana and Mahabharata to learn Tamil. I taught him Thirukkural and I noticed that he was responding well,” said Chinnakaruppuviru. Though there is no cure for polio, Arul is exercising his legs as much as he can and was taught to do daily chores by his father. His father also encouraged him to improve his speech and learning ability.

However, Chinnakaruppuviru was unable to get proper treatment for his son as they could not afford it.

“I went to several doctors. While some said that my boy would gradually be able to recover by himself, others said that he would need to stop schooling. He was in Class VIII at that time. Stopping education was impossible. I could not study properly but at least my son should. I tried my best to keep him motivated to do any work be it at home or school,” he said.

Arul says that his favourite subjects are Tamil, science and social science. “I’m trying my best. I have support from my teachers and friends. I can draw well too though I’m not really that interested. I hope to study well to pass the exams,” he said, carefully stressing each word and adding a nervous laugh at the end.

Representative image

SALIGAO/CALANGUTE: Given the slump in tourism this year, Calangute panchayat has decided not to increase any fees or taxes .

Kundan Kerkar, a Calangute villager, said at the gram sabha on Sunday that the panchayat needs to study the reasons for the drop in tourism in the otherwise popular coastal village.

“People have invested all their money in tourism businesses, and if tourism here crashes then we will all suffer,” he said.

Usually, every year trade licences, house tax, garbage tax and other taxes are increased by 10%.

Calangute sarpanch Francis Rodrigues said, “The tourist season has been bad for the last two years, and bowing to the sentiments of the people, for the last two years the panchayat has not increased taxes. If we had to increase taxes by 10% last year and another 10% this year, it would have amounted to a 20% jump. This would have been an additional burden on the people.”

Garbage management and pimps harassing visitors were some of the other issues that dominated Calangute’s first gram sabha meeting of the new year.

The budget proposals for Calangute amounting to Rs 26.5 crore led to a few queries, with gram sabha member Anthony D’souza demanding to know where the scrap material which is collected along with garbage and other waste is sold, and how much income is generated from it, as used to happen in previous years.

Rodrigues said all the scrap is also sent to the garbage treatment plant at Saligao and not sold. Panch Shawn Martins clarified that earlier the panchayat had its own sorting place so the scrap was sold, adding that following directions from the National Green Tribunal, the panchayat is in the process of setting up a material recovery facility in Calangute.

Villagers also complimented the panchayat for taking giant strides in clearing garbage and maintaining cleanliness, but said some dark spots are still being used to dump garbage. Rodrigues said they clear all the dark spots daily despite which people keep dumping garbage at some places, and added though they have placed the spots under CCTV surveillance, it is not possible to eliminate it completely.

The meeting which started at 11am concluded by 11.30am causing consternation among a section of the members over the short duration. In the past, gram sabhas would witness heated exchanges and even go on all day, winding up in the night.

Madurai: The site for the Rs 5 crore centre for excellence for jasmine, has been identified in Thiruparankundram in Madurai district.

The Tamil Nadu government had given the nod for establishing the centre in Madurai two years ago. However, finalising the site delayed the process.

The centre is to be established with 40% funding from the state and another 60% from the central government. As soon as the Tamil Nadu government allocated Rs 2 crore for the project, officials in Madurai got into the process of identifying a suitable place for setting it up.

Initially, it was decided to set up the centre in Poonchuthi near Melur but it was opposed by some people who went to court and stalled it. Efforts to establish it on an eight-acre site near Paravai also did not prove fruitful.

Deputy director of horticulture, Madurai G O Bhoopathy said that a five-acre site had been identified on the Thiruparankundram - Avaniapuram Road and the work would begin soon.

Centres for excellence for different flowers and vegetables would aim at developing facilities which would help the farmers reap the benefits of their cultivation without having to depend on middlemen.

Farmers would also be trained in techniques of cultivation and marketing. The centre would also help students have hands-on training.

Nagpur: To make the Safe and Smart City Project more effective, the Smart City special purpose vehicle — Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) — had proposed installation of an additional 3,000 CCTVs, artificial intelligence (AI) and extension of footage storage capacity to 90 days. The proposal is pending with the state government since one year despite the need for the technological infrastructure which is crucial to control law and order and traffic violations as well.

“Projects proposed in the interest of the city, especially the ones related to security, will be given top priority. Plans pending with the government will be verified and cleared as soon as possible,” said Maharashtra minister Nitin Raut.

Mayor Sandip Joshi said he would also take up the issue with the government. “I will talk to NSSCDCL chairman Praveen Pardeshi and the BMC commissioner. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis had approved the project during his tenure as chief minister. I will discuss the proposed works with Fadnavis and approach the government by taking his help. The issue needs to be taken up seriously,” he said.

Fadnavis had approved Rs520 crore for the project. L & T was awarded the project on October 18, 2016 for operation and maintenance for five years. Around 3,700 CCTVs were installed at 660 junctions across the city. All CCTVs are connected with the optical fibre network of 1,200km range.

NSSCDCL developed City Operation and Centre at the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) head office where feed from all CCTVs can be seen simultaneously. It came to the notice of NMC, NSSCDCL and police that some more junctions, T-points situated between major squares also need to be covered under CCTV surveillance. Accordingly, a survey was conducted and the need arose to install an additional 3,000 CCTVs at 500 junctions. The cost for the implementation of this plan is pegged at Rs150 crore.

With the help of CCTVs, traffic police started trapping violators. But the hurdle is personnel having to to sit in City Operation Centre to identify them. The traffic police requested NSSCDCL to install AI so that traffic violations can be automatically detected and notice served to violators. The NSSCDCL, too, proposed this plan.

A huge quantum of feed comes from 3,700 CCTVs. The feed is proving to be beneficial in detecting crimes and identifying criminals. But the storage of footage is limited to just 15 days. Police and NMC suggested an increase in the storage capacity. Accordingly, NSSCDCL proposed to increase the storage capacity to 90 days. These installations are likely to cost around Rs50 crore.

NSSCDCL had submitted the proposals with the directorate of information technology (DIT) which is nodal agency for the Safe and Smart City Project. The government needs to make provision for funds to enable DIT to clear the plans.

Even smalls towns like Kamptee, Butibori and Hingna which are situated on the outskirts of the city are covered under the project.

Under the same project, the police is being provided five drones and mobile surveillance vehicles to maintain law and order during rallies, mass gatherings, winter session of the state assembly, riots and natural disasters.

There was a steady rise in cases since 2017, but the number saw three-fold increase in 2019.Health department authorities say the exceptional rise in cases in 2019 was due to a spurt in other parts of the country. They feel that the scene in 2020 will not be as bad as last year if precautionary measures are taken ahead of monsoon.“We had more cases last year as there was high incidence of dengue across the country,” said Dr Anant Palekar, in-charge of national vector control programme in Goa.“It is not right to assume that we will have more dengue cases this year as well,” he said, adding, “with proper precautions, spread of dengue virus can be controlled”. Palekar said that post-November 2019, there were a few cases.“There has been sporadic prevalence, mostly in Vasco. We get one or two cases of dengue a week,” he said.Majority of dengue cases, including a death incident, occurred during monsoon. Quite a few cases were also detected in some upmarket areas of Panaji.Dengue mosquitos were found breeding in houses where people keep flower pots. In areas where there is no regular water supply, dengue mosquitoes breed.“We advise people to cover up water storage tanks, especially in those areas where there is irregular water supply and clean those once a week,” he said.Besides, improper disposal of waste can also be a source of dengue spread. “Used plastic cups, coconut shells or items that can hold water could be a source for dengue mosquito breeding.

MADURAI: The Kanyakumari district police on Sunday arrested Navas Shahul for projecting slain special sub-inspector (SSI) Y Wilson as responsible for the prime accused Abdul Sameem becoming a terrorist.

Wilson was shot and stabbed to death while he was on duty at the Kaliyakkavilai check post in the inter-state boundary of Kanyakumari district on January 8.

Shahul, a native of Thengapattanam coastal town identifies himself as the state coordinator of the minority unit of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee on his Facebook page. On January 14, the day Sameem and his accomplice Thoufiq were arrested at the Udupi railway station in Karnataka, Shahul had a series of posts on his Facebook page.

In one of the posts, he said that Sameem of Thiruvithancode was good in studies. Several years ago, when he was chatting with his friends on the banks of the Amaravathi river, a police team led by Wilson, who was then serving at the Thuckalay police station spotted them and framed them on the charge of attempting to bomb the RSS office.

The Facebook post added that the boys were booked for their extremist act of conspiring the bombing, harassed them by taking them to several places and finally lodged them in jail. “Framed as a terrorist, he (Abdul Sameem) made friends with terrorists in the jail and became a terrorist,” the post added. His other posts also directly targeted Wilson and wanted the police to probe the angle of personal enmity between Sameem and Wilson.

Shahul was booked under Section 505(2) (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes) of the Indian Penal Code (IPS) and under Section 67 (punishment for publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form) of the Information Technology Act by the Puthukadai police, based on a complaint from sub-inspector Elango.

He was arrested at the Thengapattanam bus stand around 5.30am on Sunday when he was waiting to board a bus. “He came from Thiruvananthapuram to meet his parents residing at Thengapattanam and was waiting for a bus when we arrested him,” Puthukadai inspector R Rajeshwari said. He was produced before a Kuzhithurai magistrate and remanded in judicial custody.

“He was booked and arrested for spreading false information,” superintendent of police (SP) of Kanyakumari district N Shreenath said.

On Monday, Sameem and Thoufiq will be produced before the Kuzhithurai judicial magistrate, when the plea by the police seeking custody of the duo for inquiry will be heard.

PANAJI: Old Goa police on Sunday filed an FIR against Wilson Godinho, brother of panchayat minister Mauvin Godinho, for abetment of suicide in the death of former Merces sarpanch Prakash Naik. The police also booked one Tahir.

Both names were mentioned in a complaint lodged by the Naik family on Saturday night. “We filed the FIR under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the IPC, and investigation is in progress,” police said.

Outside the Old Goa police station on Sunday, Prakash’s brother Vinay told reporters that if Wilson is not called to the police station, other ministers’ relatives may also get involved in heinous crimes. He, however, said that the family would accept the body and conduct the final rites on Monday.

Naik, a serving Merces panch member, allegedly shot himself on Friday minutes after posting a message to a 200-member WhatsApp group that he was “under tremendous pressure” from two persons over a property matter that he could not handle.

The deceased had contested assembly elections in 2017 on the state’s oldest regional party MGP.

On Saturday, the Naik family said that they would not accept the body till the two named by him in the message were arrested. They also demanded that the case be moved from the Old Goa police to crime branch.

“Both the persons (named by Naik in his message) used to demand Rs 45 lakh from him, but we don’t know why,” a family member told reporters. “We do not believe that he committed suicide.”

Family members alleged that CCTV cameras at Naik’s residence had stopped functioning from January 15. They said that on Friday, the maid had noticed that the back door of his house was open.

322,['20/01/2020'],"Tamil Nadu: Man on a green mission plants 2,500 trees in six years","This story is from January 20, 2020

Ukkrapandi (sitting third from right) at a sapling planting drive

MADURAI: V Ukkrapandi, 45, from Thankkankulam village on the city outskirts has planted and nurtured 2,500 trees in the last six years. He was 39 years old when he started planting trees in and around his village by organizing teams of students and youngsters.

Ukkrapandi, who runs a jewellery pawn shop, does not just plant saplings and leave them. For him, it is important to tend to every single sapling planted until the stage where it can survive on its own.

“I plant saplings, which are at least eight-foot-high and are produced in my own nursery. I spend a few hours in the mornings and evenings to tend the saplings and water them,” he said.

He said that he even chooses tree varieties according to the location. Neem for roadside, peepal and banyan for empty spaces near temples, jamun trees in vacant lands and flowering trees near houses since there is a misconception that roots of bigger tree varieties will damage the property.

Initially, Ukkrapandi watered trees by carrying pots on cycle. On observing his dedication, a Lions Club came forward to buy him a light commercial vehicle. He used to plant saplings only once or twice in a year and spent the remaining time taking care of them. He also made sure to set aside 15% of his yearly income towards planting trees.

He has now taken up work to plant 10,000 trees on 70 acres’ land in Kappalur Sidco industrial estate along with activists, industrialists, government officials and locals and has already planted 400 saplings in 6.5 acres so far.

Meanwhile, a private company employee, G Manivannan, 33, from Kalainagar in Madurai , if focusing on increasing green cover in rural areas. He has mobilized a group of people from Vandapuli village to start a movement called ‘Vanathukkul Vandapuli’ and has planted more than 150 trees in a few villages.

He along with green activists C P Ravi and Durai Vijayapandian have now launched ‘Olirum Madurai’, an organization to promote green cover and to help students in need of financial support to continue education.

“We three had successfully convinced authorities from the district rural development agency to provide manpower from MNREGA to plant and maintain trees in Miyawaki method. As a result, three Miyawaki forests have been created in the last three months,” said Manivannan.

323,['20/01/2020'],Kerala to reclaim land allotted for Coast Guard Academy,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The state government is all set to take back the 148 acres of land that it had handed over to the Centre to construct Coast Guard Academy at Azheekkal in Kannur.

According to sources in the industries department, the state has sent a communication to the Centre seeking the status of the project and whether it is going ahead with the project. “The Centre had informed the Parliament that it is not going ahead with the project, but the state government has not received any communication in this regard. We need a formal communication from the Centre for which we have written to the Centre seeking the status of the project. Once we receive that, we will go ahead with taking back the land,” sources associated with the office of industries minister said.

Union minister of state for defence Shripad Naik had informed Rajya Sabha MP Elamaram Kareem in December that the project has been dropped following denial of coastal regulation zone clearance from the ministry of environment, forest and climate change. The ministry had denied the clearance as the proposed site for the project at Azheekkal fell within the CRZ- 1(A) area, where construction is not permitted.

The land

Meanwhile, Elamaram Kareem said that the BJP government’s policies and the former UDF government’s lackadaisical approach resulted in the state losing the project. “The project was sanctioned when the LDF government was in power in the state, by the then defence minister A K Antony. It was sanctioned after an expert panel of the defence team visited the site and reported that the land is most suitable for the project. There is no logic in citing CRZ rules in this regard as the Coast Guard Academy cannot be set up away from the sea. But the subsequent UDF government failed to take the project forward even when the UPA was in power at the Centre till 2014. The new NDA government has decided not to proceed with the project, seemingly due to political reasons,” Kareem said, who was also the industries minister in the state when the project was sanctioned.

In a similar manner, the Centre had decided to scrap the proposed rail coach factory at Kanjikode in Palakkad that was announced in the 2008 railway budget. The state government had acquired 239 acres of land for the project and in 2012, the then railways minister Dinesh Trivedi had also laid the foundation stone for the project.

Though the project is unlikely to come up, the land is still with the railways. The state government is exploring possibilities of setting up a coach factory in collaboration with global giants in the sector, as coaches for metro rail, semi-high speed rail, etc will be in demand in the coming years.

‘Valiyakesvan’ (in pic) and ‘Guruvayoor Padmanabhan’ have been restricted from taking part in temple functions

(By: Sandeep Thomas)

THRISSUR: Forty-five days after imposing restrictions on ‘ Guruvayur Padmanabhan ’ and ‘Valiyakesvan’, the two elephants of Guruvayur devaswom, the forest department has finally decided to constitute an expert committee to inspect the health conditions of the elephants. The department had on December 7 imposed restrictions on these elephants over participation in any functions due to age and health-related issues.

M N Jayachandran, a member of Kerala state animal welfare board, filed a complaint before the Thrissur assistant forest conservator stating that Valiyakesavan was suffering from tuberculosis and abscesses and 80-year-old Padmanabhan had foot rot. Following the complaint, the forest department had restricted the temple authorities from using the elephants during functions.

Thrissur assistant conservator P M Prabhu said, “After imposing restrictions we requested the district animal husbandry department officials to inspect the elephants. However, they said higher authorities from veterinary university will inspect them. Then we approached the veterinary university authorities, who said they are only referral agency to inspect the reports. Hence, I submitted a report to chief wildlife warden to constitute a special team to inspect the elephants.”

Chief wildlife warden Surendrakumar told TOI, “We will constitute an expert committee on Monday and the team will inspect the elephants soon.”

Speaking to TOI, Guruvayur devaswam deputy administrator Saisidaran said, “There are no health issues in these two elephants. An expert team in the Guruvayoor devaswom has already inspected the elephants and said they are healthy.”

Meanwhile, collector S Shanavas said he didn’t get any complaints from Guruvayur devaswom. “ I think there is no issue in using the elephants during rituals inside the Guruvayur Temple . When the devaswom officials submit a complaint I will take further action,” he said.

Toll plazas on the national highway at Chittampatti and Kappalur witnesses about 20,000 and 30,000 vehicles re... Read More

MADURAI: Toll gates within and outside the city, which usually sees a heavy rush during the week, witnessed a worsened situation on Sunday, as many people began leaving after a long festival holiday. Many travellers had to wait for not less than 15 minutes at each of the three toll gates situated on the Inner Ring Road before leaving the city, especially with Fastags not working there as the gates come under the state highways, which are yet to be covered under the system.

To add to the woes of the vehicle users, the rude behaviour by the staff in all three gates results in arguments between them and the drivers. There are a very few police personnel posted in all these places.

A vehicle going from K K Nagar towards the airport can obtain a two-way pass for Rs 30 including the two toll gates at Vandiyur and Chinthamani. “When I entered the Inner Ring Road through the Ramnad Road, the toll gate employee at Chinthamani refused to give me a two-way ticket. This shows that these three toll gates were set up without proper planning,” said K Selvakumar of K K Nagar.

While disputes at the toll gates on the Inner Ring Road are a regular affair, it became worse this weekend when Chennai-bound vehicles from other districts resulted in even longer queues. “We left Tuticorin at 5am so that we could reach Chennai early, but were inordinately delayed at these toll gates,” said Ramkumar of Chennai.

Due to the queues, private buses, which ply on a time basis, violated the norms and entered the free lanes on the opposite side of the road before the toll gates, to beat the rush, making it extremely dangerous for upcoming vehicles on those roads. “Even the police at the toll gates seem to worry only about the ticketing and not violation by buses. They should be fined heavily,” said S V Pathy of Gomathypuram. He added that the Inner Ring Road has become a bane causing only delays, rather than speeding up a journey, for which it was actually meant for.

Meanwhile, toll plazas on the national highway at Chittampatti and Kappalur, which witnesses about 20,000 and 30,000 vehicles respectively crossing over daily, witnessed long queues during the long festival weekend in their cash-only lanes, while the Fastag lanes wore a deserted look.

A toll plaza manager said that they found that only about 30% of the vehicles were Fastag-enabled, one of the reasons for the piling up of traffic.

MADURAI: AIADMK ’s alliance with other parties which was formed last year for the Lok Sabha election, has continued for the rural local body elections, and will continue for the urban local body elections too, state information and publicity minister Kadambur C Raju has said.

However, a decision on forging an alliance for next year’s assembly elections would be taken by the party’s general body, executive committee and headquarters later, Raju said while talking to reporters in Tuticorin after kickstarting a pulse polio vaccination drive on Sunday.

Raju also came down heavily on Congress leader and Trichy MP Su Thirunavukkarasar for his remarks criticising AIADMK mouthpiece ‘Namadhu Puratchi Thalaivi Amma’. Reacting to a statement by fisheries minister D Jayakumar’s remark that knowledge will grow if one reads the AIADMK party organ, Thirunavukkarasar countered it by saying that those who read it would be destroyed. To this, Raju said that Thirunavukkarasar is a politician lacking clarity on where he belongs to, and only he can match himself in jumping so many parties in Tamil Nadu .

Nashik: Union Ministry of State Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, MP Raosaheb Danve has taken a dig at the state government by referring them as “Amar, Akbar and Anthony” and “will break down at any moment”.

He further challenged the government to bring in more efficient and vibrant schemes for the welfare of the public instead of the closing down the earlier ones intended to help the people in the long run. “The current state government in Maharashtra is not a stable government. Amar, Akbar and Anthony have joined hands to form the government and they lack consensus on issues. I am confident this government will ‘break’ down any moment,” Danve said.

The former BJP state president said that the government had applied brakes on various projects by his BJP-led state government during the last five years. “Applying brakes on the public-oriented schemes by the earlier government is not a good idea as they will bear fruits after some time. The state government should in fact bring out bigger and better schemes to match the work done by the earlier government,” Danve said.

Meanwhile in Jalna, Arjun Khotkar from Shiv Sena, the competitor of Raosaheb Danve, during a public rally said that it was a mistake that he did not contest the Lok Sabha elections (in May 2019). As Shiv Sena and BJP were allies while contesting the parliamentary elections and Khotkar had to withdraw to allow Danve to contest elections.

When Danve was asked for his reaction on the same, he said, “Khotkar has not leveled any allegations against me. Whatever he said there has reference to the audience only.”

Danve said that the government wanted to the diver the attention of the masses from its failure on multiple fronts. Irrelevant issues like raising the height of the statue of Dr B.R Ambedkar, Shiv Sena leaders asking the family descendants to prove the same etc are the claims behind it.

“Such kinds of issues are raised only when the government does not want the people to focus on the important issues of the governance. The current government is unable to perform because their ideologies do not match,” he said.

Hyderabad: When it comes to paying convicts for their work in jails, Telangana prisons are among the top three well-paying prisons in the country.

However, when it comes to those who are semi-skilled or unskilled, the payments are not on a par with many other prisons in the country, even though the convicts have put Telangana on top of the list in terms of value of sales. A convict is paid for whatever work he/she does in the jail.

According to the prison statistics for the country, in Telangana prisons, a skilled worker is paid Rs 170 per day. However, a semi-skilled worker gets only Rs 50 and an unskilled worker earns Rs 30.

Prisons officials said that some of the prisoners in the state may not be getting paid as much as prisoners in some of the other jails in the country because the facilities that are provided to them in the jails of Telangana are far better than what’s provided to prisoners in other prisons of the country.

“Not only do we have modern prisons with good amenities in Telangana, we also provide prisoners with proper food and clothing,” IG prisons B Saidaiah said.

The money that prisoners earn is deposited in the bank accounts that are opened for them.

The accumulated earnings can be withdrawn at the time of their release. Some amount is also given to the prisoners themselves in the form of tokens for them to buy what they want to from the jail canteen.

PANAJI: A Class X or XII student, who applies for re-evaluation of marks, will be eligible for a full refund of the reevaluation fees, if the students ’ marks change due to errors on the part of the examiner, Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education has told schools. In case of discrepancies in marks caused by errors by the examiner by ‘not transferring marks, leaving question unassessed and by making mistakes in totaling marks’, the student will be eligible for 100% refund.

The board charges Rs 700 per subject as reevaluation fees. While the Class XII board exams are set to begin on February 26, the Class X public exam will be held from April 2 onwards.

Ahead of the exam, the board issued instructions to the heads of high schools and higher secondary schools giving clarifications on various processes related to the exam. “No refund is permitted after the re-evaluation is carried out irrespective of change in the marks/result, except, if change is due to discrepancies like transferring of marks, unassessed question and totaling mistake of marks (100% refund), 50% deduction for any other discrepancy,” the board told schools.

The board has said that if after the re-evaluation of marks, there is a wide variation observed in the original and re-evaluated marks by 10% or more, a second opinion from the reviewer will be sought. In this case, the scores allotted by the examiner, the re-evaluator and the reviewer will be compared. The average of the higher two of three scores will be considered.

“If the candidate is declared passed in the examination after the re-evaluation and had simultaneously applied for re-exam, the exam fee will be refunded after deduction of 50% as processing fees,” the board said.

The board has also said that students will not be provided photocopies of the re-evaluated answersheets under any circumstances.

<p>Citizens will have to pay for 22 on-road and off-road smart parking spaces from February 1<br></p>

NASHIK: Citizens will have to pay for 22 on-road and off-road smart parking spaces from February 1.

Earlier, the smart city officials had decided to start pay and parking from November 1; however, they had to postpone the plan for a month owing to technical problems.

At present, the smart parking spaces are operational on trial basis and citizens were allowed park their vehicles in these spaces free of cost since July 1. However, the situation is going to change from February 1 as these free parking spaces will be chargeable.

Smart city officials said they have proposed commercial operations from February 1 and the proposal will be tabled in the board meeting scheduled for next week.

There will be total 4,500 slots for two-wheeler and four-wheeler parking at these 22 spaces. The parking charges will be Rs 10 per hour for four-wheelers and Rs 5 per hour for two-wheelers.

“Moreover, we also have a different proposal, under which parking at these said spot will be provided free for the first 30 minutes and then charged thereafter. The proposal was drafted following a huge demand from citizens who said that they often parked their vehicles on roadside for a few minutes due to some work. And, despite parking only for a few minutes, they will have to pay the charges, which according to some, is an unfair deal. However, nothing has been finalised so far. The issue is to be discussed at board meeting of Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation Ltd (NMSCDCL),” said sources from the smart city.

“We had also put marking on these parking spaces. However, the markings at some spots have disappeared. We will immediately start working on the marking lines again,” added the sources from smart city.

The Mumbai-based private company, Trigyn Technologies Pvt Ltd, won the bid for setting up total 33 smart parking spaces — 28 on-street and 5 off-street parking — across the city. Of these 33, 22 have been made operational.

A special app — Nashik Smart Parking — has been developed to help riders check the online status of parking spaces and availability of parking slots. Motorists can even make pre-bookings of the parking lots online through the mobile app which can be downloaded from the Google Play store.

Earlier, the charges for four-wheeler parking were Rs 30 per hour and Rs 15 per hour for two-wheelers. But, after public demand, the parking charges have been slashed at large. Now, the parking charges for four-wheelers would be Rs 10 per hour and Rs 5 for two-wheelers.

Malappuram: The Child Welfare Committee (CWC) authorities have said that financial insecurity was one of the major factors that led to the sexual abuse of four minor girls by their father near Valanchery.

Preliminary probe conducted by CWC and district child protection unit have found that since the accused was the sole breadwinner of the family, his wife and five children, including a 19-year-old youth, were unable to oppose the 47-year-old man’s sexual atrocity.

Valanchery police arrested the man on Saturday for abusing his four daughters aged 17, 15, 13 and 10. The children are sheltered in a child care institute (CCI). The incident came to light when the younger girl revealed the abuse to school authorities.

CWC chairman Shajesh Bhaskar said the family was reeling under financial crisis and the family members had no other way than depending on the accused. “The mother and children had to suppress many things as they would be in trouble if the person had left them,” he said.

“The accused was a headload worker and he was physically strong. The mother or children were unable to oppose any attempt of molestation from his part. He is also an alcoholic,” he said. TNN

Members of the jail’s music band during a performance

UDAIPUR: ‘Vasudev Kutumbakam - Hum ek hain, pyaare hain aur tumhare hain…’ when one hears 55-year-old Parmeshwar Bhai singing a self-composed Sufi song, tears well up in one’s eyes. Parmeshwar is a convict at Udaipur Central Jail but now he is an artist and wishes to remain one for the rest of his life.

Jarnail Singh, lovingly called Judge Bhai, is another singer of the jail band that specialises in Sufi and classical music. Both Parmeshwar and Judge Bhai are here in connection to biggest ever drug (mandrax) seizure case in India that was busted in November 2016.

The jail band members have been appreciated widely during their performances on several occasions, some even outside the prison. Now, they are excited to participate in the World Music Festival that will be held here next month. Looking at their enthusiasm, the jail administration has funded and purchased latest musical equipment worth Rs 90,000.

The central jail is not just a prison anymore. It is transforming into a learning place, a ‘jail university’, is what the teachers and learners here call it. An innovation in rehabilitation prison practice is being developed in Udaipur. The Swaraj Jail University was launched here in October 2018 by Shikshantar, Art of Living, Gandhi Ashram-Moved by Love, Edible Routes Foundation and Navgurukul in partnership with the Udaipur Central Jail.

This jail university has a computer and a music academy that run daily. Inmates learn web designing, sound mixing, graphic making here. Several inmates participate in daily yoga and mindfulness sessions. Based on the learning interests of the inmates, they have been participating in workshops related to photography, charcoal illustration, storytelling, basic counselling and listening circles and permaculture design-organic farming. There is also a team of inmates who are developing an organic farm and permaculture demo-centre in the jail with experts’ guidance. One can find keyhole garden, compost pits, banana circles, food forest here.

“I joined here in June 2018, after the project began, I’ve been witnessing a lot of positivity, repentance in the attitude of many inmates. Some 125 inmates are engaged in various projects. Most of them are more calm and composed than what they were earlier,” claims jail superintendent Surinder Singh Shekhawat.

Against the capacity of 950 inmates, Udaipur jail houses 1,450 prisoners. Some 125 prisoners have been involved in the first phase of project.

Indira Talreja, yoga trainer from Art of Living, has been tirelessly engaging with inmates in the jail for the past 12 years and sharing the transformative power of yoga and mindfulness with them. “We started the project with the purpose of prototyping a self-designed learning programme in the jail. The purpose is to help inmates explore their passion, gain practical skills, and re-ignite self-esteem and life vision in the face of the numerous challenges of incarcerated life. The inmates are invited to design their own personalised learning programmes based on their interests and needs. Everyone is a teacher and a learner here,” says Manish Jain, co-founder of Shikshantar.

Nashik Municipal Corporation

NASHIK: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has made all the necessary entries of the existing properties on its property tax register — including the area and property tax levied.

Accordingly, the details of the properties in the current financial year (2019-20) have been carried forward in the new property tax register for 2020-21.

This property register has been put on display in all six divisional offices of the civic body. The civic body has invited objections from the property owners if they have by Monday evening. NMC will make rectification in the register if there are any valid objections raised by the property owners.

NMC has issued a public notice in this connection, urging property owners to check the information in the property register for the next financial year. “There are over 4 lakh properties within the limits of the municipal corporation. We have carried forward the details of the properties — area, use purpose, the tax levied and other details — in the property register for the next fiscal 2020-21. We have invited objections from the property owners by the evening of February 20. The objections we receive thereafter will not be considered,” said an NMC official.

There are new properties that got property tax bills for the first time during the current and last financial years. Owners of these properties will also have an opportunity to raise objections, if any, said the NMC.

NMC has set a property tax collection target of Rs 218 crore for the current financial year 2019-20. It has already collected Rs 120 crore so far. The property tax department of the NMC has introduced the amnesty scheme for tax defaulters, which is in effect upto February 10.

The NMC recovers a 2% fine per month on tax dues from the last day of paying taxes. Moreover, it also recovers expenses of notices and warrants issued to the defaulters. Under the amnesty scheme, tax defaulters who pay their entire dues in one go are given a rebate in penalty amount, warrant and notice fees. NMC has plans to auction off properties of other tax defaulters in the second half of February, said officials.

NMC give 1% concession to those who pay property taxes online. Moreover, concession in property tax of up to 5% is given to prompt property taxpayers who pay the tax in the first quarter of the financial year.

“Intense fog like situation is expected at Shekhawat area and Barmer division. The low pressure over the Himalayas will cause a change in temperature in Northern Rajasthan,” said weathermen. Sikar with 2.5°C was the coldest in the state followed by Pilani at 4.5°C.

The intense cold waves impacted traffic at several places in the city. The intense weather has also dampened the mood of the morning walkers as majority of them preferred to remain indoors.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: BJP central leadership has announced a list of all but four district presidents of the party in Kerala. The districts for which presidents have not been announced are Kottayam , Ernakulam, Kannur and Kasaragod.

In Thiruvananthapuram, V V Rajesh , party state committee member and close confidant of Union minister V Muraleedharan, replaces the incumbent S Suresh.

Other district presidents are B B Gopakumar (Kollam), Asokan Kulanada (Pathanamthitta), M V Gopakumar (Alappuzha), K S Aji (Idukki), K K Aneesh Kumar (Thrissur), E Krishnadas (Palakkad), Ravi Thelathu (Malappuram), V K Sajeevan (Kozhikode) and Saji Sankar (Wayanad). Among these, Pathanamthitta, Palakkad and Wayanad district presidents got a second term in office.

According to sources, BJP was forced to reserve the list of four district presidents following hectic parleys by Muraleedharan and P K Krishnadas and also after intervention by RSS. The central leadership is yet to announce the new state president for the party. The delay for it is also attributed to factionalism as well as intervention by the RSS.

There were rumours in the party that Sadanandan Master whose legs were chopped off by CPM cadres in 1994 may be considered as a consensual candidate for the post of Kannur district president. He had unsuccessfully contested the Koothuparamba assembly constituency in last election.

Though party state general secretary K Surendran continues to be a frontrunner to the post of state president, state leadership of the RSS is yet to accept his candidature.

The party’s internal exercise was completed in 21 of the BJP’s 36 state and union territory units. The BJP constitution stipulates that its national president can be elected after hand of the total state units have coupled their organisatonal election exercise. The party national working president J P Nadda is all likely to occupy the party president post in a couple of days.

342,['20/01/2020'],Centre approves Rs 5 crore for repair of museum palace inside Sonar fort,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Representative image

JAISALMER: UNESCO world heritage site and the country’s only living fort — Sonar fort , has been facing continuous deterioration, while the state government and the ASI seem indifferent to its condition.

Meanwhile, To repair the museum palace , a proposal had been sent on behalf of former royals by the Jaisalmer Girdhar Smarak Trust to government of India’s art and culture ministry through the district collector, and the Centre has approved Rs 5 crore for it. After getting this amount, the condition of the palace of ex-royals would improve, but no big plan has been made to keep the Sonar fort safe.

Two years ago, a meeting was held at the Central level for conservation of Sonar fort, in which it was discussed to form an authority and in 2014, the site management plan was to be implemented. However, till date neither the authority has been formed nor the site management plan implemented, and the fort is continuously slipping into a bad shape. Museum palace, which is under the ownership of former royals, has also reached a dangerous condition, due to which tourists have stopped going to the rooftop as a preventive measure.

For quite some time now, there have been unchecked illegal constructions at the Sonar fort and commercial activities are taking place by tampering its original structure, due to which the 861-year-old fort is continuously getting deteriorated. Due to seepage of water, the stones are getting weak and are leaving their place and some of the stones are turning into sand due to the water seepage.

The new sewerage line that was laid by RUIDP was also not laid properly. Due to lack of proper monitoring by experts, there are mistakes in laying the line and its water is making the fort's foundation hollow. With the deteriorating condition of the fort, accidents can take place any time. Two years ago, empower committee of the fort took many decisions but the ASI, municipal council and other agencies failed to implement them. There is encroachment in the fort. Site management plan was the main parameter of the UNESCO heritage site, but this plan was submitted to ASI in 2014 but has not been implemented.

District collector Namit Mehta said that ASI is the main agency for conservation and maintenance of the fort and the district administration has no interference in it. A proposal was received from ex-royals for some part of the palace slipping into bad shape and they sent the proposal to the government of India.

Art & Culture official source said that Rs 5 crore has been approved for it.

Nagpur: Ridership of Nagpur Metro will not increase unless feeder services are available at stations. However, there are several problems in providing feeder services. MahaMetro has, therefore, urged state government to help it in this regard.

A Metro official said its consultant Urban Mass Transit Company Limited (UMTC) had submitted a report ‘Multimodal integration along Metro corridor in Nagpur’ to it. “This report has been forwarded to the government. UMTC has outlined how feeder services should be provided at Metro stations,” he added.

The official further said land is the biggest challenge in providing these services. “We can’t provide land for parking at every station. Limited funds are available with us for buying land. If we buy more than what is mentioned in the detailed project report (DPR), we will not have funds for construction work,” he added.

According to the official, Metro can provide parking for three to four autorickshaws at most stations. “As the ridership will increase, 15 to 20 autorickshaws will be required but we don’t have land for parking. Only government can make available the extra land,” he added.

“Many people would like to reach Metro stations using own vehicles. There should be enough space at each station for parking them. As per the DPR, parking is to be made available at only a few stations,” said the official.

The official further said parking slots will also be needed at some distance from stations. “For example, if a small parking space is made available inside a commercial area near a station, then people can hire e-scooters or e-bicycles from the station, travel using them and then park the e-bikes at the mini-parking slot. Such type of facilities are essential,” he added.

Meanwhile, the state government is yet to take a decision on Metro’s proposal to provide it land at nominal cost instead of at ready reckoner prices. “The cost of the land calculated while preparing the DPR was as per the ready reckoner value in effect at that time. Now, the prices have increased significantly. Secondly, we had to spend extra money on buying private land. The DPR calculates the cost equivalent to ready reckoner rates. However, as per law enacted in 2013, the acquiring agency has to pay 2.5 times the market price. Hence, if we don’t get government land at nominal price, we will face funds crunch,” the official said.

Kozhikode: The anti-theft squad of Kerala Water Authority (KWA) started initiating severe action against those unauthorized to use water supplied by KWA for construction and other purposes. They have started disconnecting water supply permanently and imposing hefty fines.

KWA officials started the action based on the complaints that many KWA consumers have started using supplied drinking water to water the buildings under construction and for other purposes. The incidents of misuse of water have increased in many areas with the end of the monsoon.

Action will be initiated on receiving complaints or information from public, said a KWA official. “We are also planning to carry out random inspections to check misuse of water,” the official said.

KWA has decided to strengthen action against water theft and misuse as summer season is nearing. The department is planning to end different types of water misuse to avoid the wastage of water.

Water theft from water taps at public places and the misuse of household connections for carwash and other purposes will also be under scanner. The officials are taking immediate action and disconnecting water supply on receiving complaints.

On the other hand, some of KWA consumers are demanding proper inquiry into allegations regarding water theft and misuse before disconnecting supply. In some incidents, the officials disconnect the supply without verifying the complaint causing inconvenience to consumers, consumers pointed out.

“Water supply to my house was disconnected based on a false allegation raised by a neighbour,” said Sangeetha Prasad, a resident of Puthiyangadi. “We are now struggling to get the connection and such situation should not be created,” she said.

KWA officials have also asked the squads to check for leakage of water. Water leakage from breaking old pipes and explosion on the distribution line due to increased water pressure are also common.

According to KWA officials, water theft and related issues can be curbed completely only with the support of people. “As KWA officials are unable to carry out inspection at every residential area we would be able to speed up action if the residents extend their support,” the official said.

345,['20/01/2020'],Students should stay away from social media ahead of exams,"This story is from January 20, 2020

With exams round the corner, divisional secretary of Maharashtra State Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Office, Nashik division, Nitin Upasani tells TOI’s Pragya Jain about the tips and tricks students should keep in mind to keep exam stress at bay. Excerpts:

What steps are you taking to relieve students of examination stress?

We had brought in two programmes last year— copy free campaign and fearless examination campaign— to relieve students of examination stress. We prepared a module and trained our officials to talk to the students in all the schools of the division. The seminars and discussions were conducted at the divisional, district and block levels. We explained to the students that if they copy during exams, they will be less confident in their future prospects.

The unsuccessful students tend to attempt suicide at a young age. How do you tackle this proble m?

Last year, the fearless examination campaign was a real success. We called the teachers, students and parents to make them understand that securing high marks in examinations was not the ultimate goal in life. A student has to develop all-round character that will help him in every phase of his life. Thankfully, we do not have a single report of any student attempting suicide in 2019.

What measures should a student take so as not to be debarred from exams?

We have given directions to the teachers to ensure students use the extra time to read the instructions on the answer sheet before writing their papers. Many students have the tendency of writing pleas to the examiners asking for good marks. Some students tear the page of the answer sheet if they make any mistake. They should not tear the pages, instead ask the invigilator to sign on the sheet or replace the answer booklet. We have asked the headmasters of all the schools to talk to Class X students once a week and and tell them about the repercussions of doing anything that is prohibited during the exams. Girl students suffer the most as they are asked to work on the farms or get married if debarred. Last year, 900 students were debarred for writing unnecessary details on their answer booklets, like revealing their identity, threatening to commit suicide or tearing the pages of the answer booklets. We have held many awareness sessions this year.

How do you ensure effective counselling in the schools?

A teacher is the best counsellor for the students. By December-end, all teachers complete their syllabus. Thereafter, they have ample time to have one-on-one discussions with every student. The teachers are trained for counselling while getting their qualification degree and are the best judge of their students. We also keep formulating modules frequently to help teachers understand the psychology of students.

What is it that you think is affecting students’ studies most these days?

I would ask the parents to ensure that their wards stay away from social media. Because of social media, students get distracted and distance themselves from family values. Instead of investing time on social media, students should play in the grounds, go to the library and discuss about their personal matters with their friends and family.

Representative image

AJMER: More than 2 lakh metric tonne waste will be bio-mined for the first time in Ajmer , so that 27 acre of land can be recovered at Makhupura, which is the dumping ground of the city at present.

The bio-mining project will be in public-private partnership mode, which will remove tonnes of garbage and cost Rs 14 crore.

Commissioner of AMC Chinmayee Gopal said that at present, the Ajmer Municipal Corporation is generating 250 tonne waste per day from 60 wards of the city. This includes residential areas, markets and urban slums and after collecting the garbage, it is dumped at Makhupura, on Nasirabad Road about 10km from the city, with an area of 318 acre. This dumping ground is in use since 1997 and before that, the garbage was dumped between Zanana Hospital and MDS University Road.

The report said that the Makhupura dumping ground is located on a hilly region and therefore, the surface is uneven with small hills and also valleys and therefore waste is dumped in haphazard manner and many large garbage piles have been formed, which can be seen from the main road. The Ajmer Smart City Ltd has prepared contour and topology maps to know the actual quantity of the waste. It was found to be about 3,60,542 cubic metre of solid waste.

The waste disposed at Makhupura is un-segregated and no treatment or processing of this waste is possible. It has been overly exposed to the elements over the years and natural decomposition has occurred. The present material has very low organic content as per the survey conducted in last December and the total waste dumped at Makhupura ground is 2,20,000 metric tonne and the physio-chemical analysis of the waste has also been done.

Therefore in one year, the whole quantity and its disposal will be done in a scientific manner as per the CPCB solid management rules in total 27.23 acre of land and will be reclaimed by bio-mining.

349,['20/01/2020'],Planning a baby? 5 signs you are definitely fertile,"If you are planning to add a little member to your family, it is important that you understand how exactly ovulation works. Ovulation is just another normal function of our body and it occurs when the egg also known as an ovum, oocyte, or female gamete is released from the ovary. If your periods usually last around 28 days, you will be ovulating 14 days after the beginning of your menstruation cycle.It is important to remember that the ovulation phase of the menstrual cycle depends from woman to woman. However, unlike the tell-tale cramping, bloating and mood swings of PMS (premenstrual syndrome), the symptoms of ovulation aren’t that easy spot. So, if you are trying to get pregnant, here are five signs that signify that you are fertile:If you do not pay enough attention to your cervical mucus, it is important that you start keeping track of it. When you are ovulating, the discharge tends to become more watery, stretchy and begins to resemble the texture of an egg white. According to a lot of experts, the difference in cervical mucous is pretty noticeable and you may be able to stretch the fluid an inch or more between your fingers. To check for the texture of the discharge, use your clean fingers to examine the discharge down there.Some women tend to feel mild pain when the egg is released from the ovaries. It is also known as mittelschmerz (middle pain in German) and can be used to plan when to have sex if you are trying to get pregnant. While some women may experience little to no pain, others may experience a sharp twinge in their lower abdomen.Do you suddenly feel like getting hot and heavy with your partner? You can certainly blame an increased level of testosterone for the sudden desire to get it on. So, if you feel that your libido is on an all-time high, there is a huge chance that you are ovulating.If your body feels a little warmer than usual, with no obvious signs of a fever and flu, it is a sign that your body is ovulating. So, you can track your body temperature first thing in the morning after waking up to check your basal body temperature. When you begin ovulating, your basal body temperature starts increasing.If you experience a little bit of bleeding (spotting) in the middle of your menstrual cycle, it is probably your ovary releasing an egg. It is important to remember that not every woman experience spotting during ovulation. Spotting is a very light vaginal bleeding which usually lasts a day or two when you are ovulating.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73333839,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1295795/73333839.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/parenting/getting-pregnant/planning-a-baby-5-signs-you-are-definitely-fertile/articleshow/73333848.cms

Nagpur: Music lovers enjoyed the musical treat at the inaugural function of the two-day programme titled ‘Sangeet Prabhakar Taal Utsav’, at Scientific Society Hall, Laxmi Nagar, on Saturday.

It was jointly organized by SCZCC and Taal Sadhana Samooh Sanstha. The music festival was a dedication to the prominent classical vocalist Pt Prabhakar Deshkar, Pt Prabhakar Khardenavis and tabla player Pt Prabhakar Desai.

The event was inaugurated by Mohan Parkhi, C Joshi, Raju Gujjar, Shyam Deshkar and Mangala Desai. The invocatory melody ‘Karu ya naman shardela’ by Madhuri Parsodkar, Janvi and Archana gave a perfect start to the event. Rajani Hudda, the anchor, gave an insight into the background of the classical musicians for whom the event was dedicated.

The first session of the evening was ‘Swar Jhankar’, a classical music fusion. Vocalist Aditya Sawarkar was accompanied by Ravi Satfale on the tabla, Pramod Deshmukh on the flute, Shrikant Pise on the keyboard, Nandu Gohane on the drum set and Nishikant Deshmukh on the violin. Solo performances by all the instrumentalists converged on a dynamic note when Sawarkar rendered ‘Main aau tore mandarava’.

351,['20/01/2020'],Cops claim new liquor policy a deterrent to drunk driving,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The restrictions on the sale of liquor and reduction of the number of liquor shops as part of the new liquor policy seems to be having an impact as the number of cases of drunk driving is witnessing a gradual decrease. Police are of the opinion that the number of cases will go down further if there is stricter enforcement.

Over 34,470 motorists were booked for driving under the influence of alcohol in 2018. In 2019, the number of cases came down to 30,500.

Traffic police officials say that this is the first time that there has been a decrease in the number of people driving under the influence in a year. The number of such cases was increasing every year over the last decade, according to a traffic cop.

Speaking to TOI, city police commissioner RK Meena said that the police regularly produce offenders in front of the courts and the courts have sentenced 1,540 people to jail terms.

A total of 1,160 motorists were convicted and had to serve jail terms, said the police chief while adding, “We have managed to instil fear among drivers and are hopeful that the number of drunken driving cases will come down further.”

Following the introduction of the new liquor policy, the consumption of liquor as well as drunk driving cases has gone down in the city, informed officials of the prohibition and excise department.

The state government’s new liquor policy has led to the number of liquor shops in the city to decrease from 401 to 313. Moreover, the liquor shops are being maintained by the Andhra Pradesh State Beverages Corporation Limited.

According to deputy excise commissioner, Vizag T Srinivasa Rao, the cases have come down because of the hike in liquor prices and also because the stores have to shut shop by 10pm.

Traffic cops said that they have observed that many are hiring cabs instead of driving under the influence.

“We are chalking out plans to conduct surprise visits in the morning, especially along Beach Road, Madhurawada and Gajuwaka,” a traffic police official said.

352,['20/01/2020'],Capital dreams: Three-layer transport plan in pipeline,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Visakhapatnam: With chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy having proposed Visakhapatnam as the executive capital , the state government is mulling a three-layer intra-city transport network for the Port City.

First, a metro rail stretch is supposed to come up through NH-16 connecting the steel plant located in the city’s outskirts to the proposed Bhogapuram Airport in the northern part. This metro line stretch will connect the city’s most significant and congested zones like Gajuwaka, NAD Junction, Madhurawada, Kommadi and Anandapuram.

The stretch, as per the plan, will have two triburaties: One from Gurudwara to Old Post Office and another from Tadichetlapalem to RK Beach.

Speaking to TOI, an official from the Amaravati Metro Rail Corporation (AMRC) said, “The proposed metro stretch in Visakhapatnam would be 80km long.”

Adding to this, the state government is planning to start three tram routes in less congested parts of the city. The proposed tram routes would connect Pendurthi to NAD Junction, Steel Plant to Anakapalli and Old Post Office to Bheemili. The three tram routes would have at least one crossover with one metro station.

“The total length of the three tram routes would be 60km. These would be battery-operated trams and would hence be environment-friendly,” added the official.

The third layer of transport network would comprise buses, auto-rickshaws and different types of cabs. “There are discussions about APSRTC considering procurement of eco-friendly electric buses which will be able to manoeuvre through the narrow city lanes,” a transport department official told TOI.

Officials believe that getting funds for both the projects will not be a major problem. The two-phased metro project is estimated to cost Rs 16,000 crore while the tram lines are estimated to cost between Rs 100 crore to Rs 120 crore per km. While the metro rail project is supposed to end by 2024, the tramline project is slated to come to life by 2029.

The AMRC official further informed that there is a proposal to rename ‘Amravati Metro Rail Corporation’ to ‘Andhra Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation’.

According to sources in the department, this has always been the trend. Local tourist footfall comes down sharply after Sankranti, which marks the end of winter in these parts. Tourists from outside the state usually flock to the Agency during this last leg of the tourist season.

Sources informed TOI that the tourism department is expecting nearly 20 lakh tourists. Over 5,000 foreign tourists are also expected to visit the Agency area. The largest number of tourists come from West Bengal, said sources.

B Purnima Devi, district tourism officer said that this has always been the trend. “At the final leg, it is people from other states who sustain the footfall,” she said.

NEW DELHI: Taking a cue from the IRCTC model of paying compensation for delays in its Tejas trains, railway minister Piyush Goyal urged the Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation (DFCC) to give “a commitment of timely delivery”.

Speaking at the foundation day celebration of DFCC, the railway minister said, “Just like the Tejas trains have done in Delhi-Lucknow and Mumbai-Ahmedabad, we should be willing to give a commitment of timely delivery, penalise ourselves if we are delayed and insist on incentives if we do a good job. Let’s work on an incentive-penalty model even for our customers.”

Sources said this could be a possibility considering that there will be dedicated lines for freight trains once the eastern and western corridors of the DFC become operational by December 2021. The minister urged the DFCC management to ensure not a single additional day’s delay in commissioning of the two corridors beyond December 2021.

Siberian stonechat

CHENNAI: Siberian stonechat, black redstart and Isabelline wheatear are the three rare migrants sighted by birders during the four-day Pongal bird count that ended on Sunday.

K V Sudhakar, president of Madras Naturalists' Society, said recording of birds during Pongal holidays began in 2015 and this was the sixth year in which the bird count was completed. The data is fed to the site e-bird.org, he said.

Sudhakar said Siberian stonechat and Isabelline wheatear were sighted at Upparu in Tiruppur district. Siberian stonechat is a small bird resembling a house sparrow but can fly thousands of kilometres. It is found in Pakistan and migrates during winter. ""This time the birds have come to peninsular India. These two birds were not recorded in the state in recent past,"" he said.

The black redstart is migrates from the Himalayas. This bird, also small in size, can easily cover thousands of kilometres. The redstart was sighted in Dharmapuri on Saturday, Sudhakar said.

Last year, 362 species of birds were sighted by birders. On an average, each participant spent more than seven hours in watching birds and recording them.

359,['20/01/2020'],Lack of sufficient parking facility at BRTS bus stops irks passengers,"This story is from January 20, 2020

HUBBALLI: Among the most ambitious infrastructure initiatives in Karnataka , the Hubballi-Dharwad Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) has most certainly eased commute between the twin cities. The BRTS corridor, scheduled to be formally inaugurated by Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu on February 2, however is not without a few niggling issues, lack of adequate space for parking at the bus terminals being one of the major concerns.

In the case of Namma Metro in Bengaluru, many people who ride the train take their private vehicles to the station and leave it parked there and use them to return home. However, many Metro stations in Bengaluru do not provide sufficient space for parking, much to the chagrin of regular commuters. BRTS is facing a similar problem, with many passengers growing reluctant to take buses owing to the lack of provisions for parking at the terminals, which could lead to a decline in ridership.

Passengers are compelled to park their vehicles in front of houses along the corridor. There are also instances of people using the Chigari bus from the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) stop parking their vehicles on the premises of the civic agency’s office or on the campus of the Chitaguppi Hospital. “This inconveniences people visiting the hospital and residents going to HDMC office,” said Bhairidevarkoppa resident Shivappa Mayakar.

Passengers boarding and disembarking the bus at the Unkal Cross stop face a similar problem. Passengers either leave their vehicles on the corridor’s bypass or in the open spaces in Muneshwar Nagar or roads leading to Timber Yard in Sainagar.

Provisions for parking have been made only at a few bus terminals along the corridor, which has as many as 32 stops. Sunaina Pattar, a private company employee, said that her brother dropped her at the Hosur Cross stop in the morning and picked her up again in the evening. Pointing out that although she was not greatly inconvenienced, Sunaina admitted to last-mile connectivity being an issue with BRTS. “BRTS was meant to increase the percentage of people using public transport but owing to many areas in the twin cities remaining off the circuit, the very purpose gets defeated,” said Sunaina.

Hubballi-Dharwad BRTS special officer Vivekanand Vishwajanya admitted to many stations along the corridor lacking sufficient parking space. “HDMC is presently scouting for land in the vicinity of the terminals, and we will ensure that this problem is fixed soon,” he added.

HUBBALLI: Residents of twin cities did not hold back in expressing their appreciation for Union minister for parliamentary affairs and Dharwad MP Pralhad Joshi after he slammed cops and other officials for felling trees at Nehru Stadium reportedly for Union home minister Amit Shah ’s rally. However, the citizens are now raging against workers and activists of the BJP for nailing buntings and flags to trees and damaging shrubs along several thoroughfares of the twin cities. The residents are also chafing at officials of the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) and forest department for failing to act against BJP workers alleged to have damaged the trees.

Rajesh Inamdar, a Hubballi resident working in a private concern, has drawn the attention of officials of forest department to flags being nailed to shrubs on Gabbur Cross Main Road. “Regardless of whether it is the BJP, Congress or JD(S), political parties must take care not to damage the environment. I feel very bad to see our representatives killing trees, which sustain human life by producing oxygen,” Inamdar told TOI.

Lauding Joshi for criticising officials for the indiscriminate felling of trees, Inamdar said that senior members must educate workers and activists in the lower rungs of the party to be more eco-sensitive.

Social activist Deepak Shirolikar pointed out that both HDMC and the Regional Transport Office (RTO) had denied permission to hang banners and buntings on roads during the 2018 assembly elections, citing threat to safety of motorists. “But the officials in these agencies said nothing when BJP workers tied flags and buntings to trees and shrubs. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had affirmed his commitment to protect the environment, but his party workers appear not to be as concerned about the issue,” said Shirolikar.

Environmentalist Lingaraj Niduvani, meanwhile, pointed out that elected representatives of Dharwad, cutting across party lines, were sensitive about the environment. “However the workers at the grassroots are not as sensitive to the issues concerning the environment. This is the reason we find air and noise pollution levels soar when there are political rallies. Those at the top need to educate the workers about the environment,” he added.

Dr VB Nitali, also an environmentalist, said that trees must not be damaged for any cause or by any party.

‘Committed to protecting environment’

I thank the residents for bringing this issue to our notice. I think that this was a mistake not committed by our workers, but those the party had contracted to work for the rally. They were assigned the task of hanging banners and flags. But rest assured, we will ensure that even those workers hired on contract will not act in this manner henceforth. The BJP is committed to protecting the environment.

361,['20/01/2020'],"UAS, Dharwad selected for premier project, to get Rs 25 crore from World Bank","This story is from January 20, 2020

DHARWAD: Taking cognisance of the increasing number of graduates in agricultural sciences opting for jobs in seed and fertiliser companies, the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) has decided to take action to arrest this trend. ICAR has chosen the University of Agricultural Sciences ( UAS ), Dharwad for the National Agriculture Higher Education Project (NAHEP) in order to cultivate a culture wherein more graduates opt to work closely with farmers besides helping them establish firms by themselves.

The National Institution Ranking Framework (NIRF) has recognised UAS, Dharwad as the seventh best varsity in the country, while the state’s committee for higher education has recognised the university as a five-start institution. These impeccable credentials have helped UAS get selected for NAHEP. Under the project, the varsity will receive funds to the tune of Rs 25 crore from the World Bank. The funds are to be utilised for devising entrepreneurship programmes. The deadline for this initiative is March 2021.

NAHEP is an initiative meant to familiarise UAS graduates with the nous of business and entrepreneurship, so that they can chart courses on their own.

UAS, Dharwad vice-chancellor Mahadev Chetti told TOI that as many as 120 students would be selected and sent abroad for a period of three months. “They will get hands-on experience working at agriculture firms,” said Chetti.

The VC said that, in addition to the students, 60 professors would also be a part of the project and travel abroad. “They will pay a visit to various universities abroad and return with knowledge on the latest advancements in agriculture, which will then be imparted to our students here,” added Prof Chetti, beaming at the prospect of UAS having chosen for the project.

Zero-budget farming

Furthermore, UAS, Dharwad has been sanctioned Rs 4.5 crore by the Karnataka government for implementing zero budget natural farming. Prof Chetti said that the varsity was presently in the process of etching out the modalities to carry out the project by experimenting with different crops, by comparing results produced through organic farming techniques and advanced methods.

Under the zero-budget farming project, 1,300 farmers from Haveri, Dharwad and Belagavi are being trained to implement what they learn at the varsity on their fields. The beneficiaries are being taken on field visits and are being encouraged to cultivate different crops. “The state government has also sanctioned Rs 16 crore for the varsity to come up with an inventory on land source and for a project involving hydrological monitoring in Gadag, Koppal and Vijayapura districts,” he added.

Plans for as many as 633 micro watersheds, mapping of soil resources and plans for water conservation have been drawn up and submitted to the watershed department to mitigate the impact of drought, said Prof Chetti.

362,['20/01/2020'],Congestion reigns near CBT at Bhandiwad Agasi in Hubballi,"This story is from January 20, 2020

HUBBALLI: North West Karnataka Road Transport Corporation’s (NWKRTC) new Central Bus Terminus ( CBT ) at Bhandiwad Agasi in Hubballi was constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 17 crore to ease congestion and to ensure seamless entry and exit of buses from across the twin cities. However the new terminus appears not to have solved the problem, with passengers continuing to complain of the hassles involved in boarding and alighting from buses at the new five-storey facility.

Experts and residents attribute the persisting problem to the building being designed in an unscientific manner. The area around the bus terminus is often choked, making it a particularly harrowing process to enter and exit the bus stand. Residents and merchants around the bus stand have it worse; noise and air pollution have become a constant companion in their lives. The narrow roads leading to the terminus are often clogged with fumes.

CBT was completed after overcoming several technical problems in 2018. Buses to and from Ravi Nagar, Anand Nagar, Siddharoodha Mutt, Vishveshwar Nagar, Gopanakoppa and Dharwad are among those localities that use CBT as a docking point. Owing to the number of people who travel along these routes, the number of passengers using CBT is almost always high.

Former NWKRTC chairman Sadanand Dhanganavar said that the number of buses presently using the CBT was much higher than what existed when the terminus was planned and designed. “Traffic in and around the CBT too has increased sharply. The authorities need to think of something new to decongest the CBT by identifying a place closer to the terminus where some of the buses can be diverted to. A new bus stop has recently been set up near the Hubballi Railway Station for BRTS, and is some of the buses stopped there, which would reduce congestion in and around CBT,” Dhanganavar said.

Shafi M, a shopkeeper at Bhandiwad Agasi, said that they had to live amid dense fumes and dust throughout the day. “The roads in the locality are almost always choked because the buses are parked in an haphazard manner,” he added.

Sunil Mehrotra clicked a photo of the auto’s registration number and sent it to the traffic police

MUMBAI: A Vasai resident, Sunil Mehrotra, had a bitter experience reaching the international airport from Andheri station early on Sunday. The autorickshaw driver demanded a fixed price of Rs 350 for the 5km ride, which is 7 times the normal fare, and when Mehrotra refused and threatened to complain to the cops, the driver 'dumped' him and his luggage some distance away from the airport and charged him Rs 50.

Before catching his flight to Lucknow, Mehrotra emailed a complaint to traffic police along with a photograph of the auto's registration numb- er. ""An officer got back to me saying the registration number was a fake,"" he told TOI.

According to auto union sources, nearly 20,000 illegal autos ply on city roads, mainly between 12am and 6am. ""A few years back, the transport commissioner's office had promised a dedicated squad to weed out illegal autos and drivers, but no action was taken,"" said Shashank Rao, leader, Mumbai Autorickshawmen's Union. Activist Anil Galgali demanded that RTO launch a 24x7 drive to weed out unscrupulous elements outside stations and airport areas, especially for the safety of women. An auto union member, adding that many of these autos have 'ghoda' meters, which run fast and show inflated fares.

Narrating his ordeal, Mehrotra said he took a local train from Vasai and reached Andheri at 4.40am. As he walked towards the auto stand, he was hounded by drivers who said they would drop him to T2 for a fixed price. ""I refused as I wanted to go by the meter,"" he said. Just then, an auto driver drove close to him and said he would ply by the meter, so Mehrotra got in. ""As he sped towards to the airport, I pointed out that he had not put the meter flag down,"" Mehrotra said. The driver started the meter, but it showed a reading of Rs 361. ""I threatened to complain to the police control room, but the driver said the regular fare to the airport was Rs 350, assuming that I wasn't from the city. When I told him that the 5km trip would cost Rs 50-55, the driver said he would charge me Rs 100."" As Mehrotra took a photograph of the registration number printed behind the driver's seat, he demanded Rs 100 more, but Mehrotra said he would pay Rs 50. The driver halted the auto at a distance from airport gate. After Mehrotra paid him Rs 50, the driver told him that he would drop him to the gate for Rs 10. Mehrotra ignored him. Traffic cops are looking into the complaint.

HYDERABAD: Telangana high court on Sunday directed the state government and the police to submit evidence within four days to establish their claim that arrested Osmania University associate professor Chintakindi Kaseem had links with Maoists.

“These days, police are arresting people in the name of being Maoist sympathisers. Now, even professors are not being spared. Is the state trying to crush dissent this way by using its eminent domain power?” asked Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan, who along with Justice Abhishek Reddy , was hearing a house motion moved by Telangana Civil Liberties Committee, seeking Kaseem’s production before the court.

On Saturday, police arrested Kaseem from his official residence inside the Osmania University campus. The CJ, taking serious note of the early morning police action, threatened to order a CBI inquiry against them if they failed to produce Kaseem on Sunday morning. Police brought Kaseem to the CJ’s residence for hearing.

Kaseem contended that he hails from a scheduled caste background and was never involved with any Maoist activity. The professor also said that his writings were critical of the state. Responding to the CJ’s query, Kaseem said police did not misbehave with him when he was there in their custody. He, however, added, “I never admitted that I participated in any Maoistrelated activity.”

The CJ, then, told advocate-general BS Prasad: “Show us evidence that he collected money from businessmen and used the same to propagate Maoist ideology. Provide us evidence about his alleged travel to Chhattisgarh to participate in Maoist meetings.”

Prasad told the court that there were six FIRs against Kaseem, including the current one and all those spoke about his involvement in Maoist programmes.

The CJ recorded Kaseem’s statement and then directed the authorities to consider the professor’s request to shift him to Cherlapalli jail from Sanga Reddy jail where he was remanded in after his arrest by a trial court.

At least 10 persons, including students, were taken into preventive custody when they tried to reach the CJ’s residence. Since October 4 last year, 17 people have been arrested in Telangana for alleged Maoist-links.

NEW DELHI: The rapid expansion in city gas networks undertaken by the Modi government will open a Rs 22,600 crore ‘Make in India’ market for ancillary equipment needed for piping natural gas to households and refuelling CNG vehicles, say a clutch of government notes.

According to the notes, prepared for an oil ministry event on Thursday to showcase India’s CGD (city gas distribution) programme, the expansion of CNG and PNG services will also create nearly four lakh direct employment opportunities by 2027. The projections are bound to lift the mood as it come amid slowing economic growth.

Only 34 GAs (geographical areas, akin to licence areas across districts in a state) in the country had city gas distribution networks till 2014. Since then, government has given out 174 GAs for building city gas distribution networks. After 136 GAs are given out in the ninth and 10th rounds of auction, city gas distribution networks will cover 70% of the population and 53% of the country’s geographical area spanning 400 districts across 27 states.

The programme has an estimated investment potential of Rs 90,000 crore.

The number of households with PNG connections will rise to over 4 crore from 55 lakh, while the number of CNG stations will go up from 1,838 to 10,000 by 2024.

Such a scale of network expansion will need huge quantities of pipes, mechanical and smart meters, PNG regulators, compressors and boosters pumps etc, which will open up opportunities for domestic manufacturing. Similarly, the notes say there will be demand for 3.75 lakh skilled, semiskilled and unskilled manpower to run and maintain the networks. According to the government, 31% of this manpower requirement will be for skilled personnel, 56% for semi-skilled and 13% for unskilled workers.

CHENNAI: The city corporation has planned to set up two new sensory parks - one at Valasaravakkam and another at Kotturpuram. Sensory parks are built specially for the convenience of differently-abled children. The first sensory park in the city was inaugurated at Santhome , a year ago under the Centre's Smart City programme.

“The central government is committed to fulfilling its promise of exemplary transformation in J&K as the people have joyfully accepted the new administrative set-up. This is just the beginning of a journey that will change your lives and trigger fast-paced development across the region,” Goyal, who is also the railway minister, told a large gathering in Akhnoor.

He inaugurated three projects there worth around Rs 6.7 crore. “Many more are on the way. J&K is going through rapid transformation. We will all see the golden glory of the region being restored,” he said, complimenting the people for “maintaining peace” during the transition from a state to a UT.

Goyal said that by March 2021, J&K would see at least 25 projects worth an estimated Rs 25,000 crore. “Employment opportunities are coming in sectors like irrigation, electricity, sports and tourism. Every languishing project has been cleared.”

The minister said the upcoming Jammu & Kashmir Investment Summit would be an opportunity for the UT to showcase its strengths, strategies and potential in different sectors.

NAVI MUMBAI: A birthday party ended in tragedy as four persons were killed and two injured after a state transport bus rammed into a kaali peeli cab they were travelling in on the Mumbai-Goa highway on Sunday. All the victims are from Mumbai. The mishap between the Asiad ST bus and Eeco car occurred between Amtem and Koleti villages in Pen taluka of Raigad district.

The cab with six persons on board was travelling toward Mumbai, while the bus was plying from Nashik to Mahad (Raigad). The speeding bus driver lost control while plying wrongly on the Mumbai-bound carriageway and collided with the car.

Vadkhal police assistant inspector Ajit Shinde said, ""The bus driver was speeding toward Mahad (in the direction of Goa), while the Eeco car was plying toward Vadkhal (Mumbai direction). The driver who was wrongly plying on the Mumbai-bound carriageway around 5 pm rammed into the Eeco.""

Shinde said the deceased were Mankhurd resident Santosh Sakharkar (38) and Mahalaxmi residents Mangesh Goregaonkar (35), Anil Chandorkar (42) and Santosh Bhonkar (40). The injured are Nalasopara resident, Saiprakash Nadkar (38) and Lower Parel resident Jaysingh Kargutkar (28). The six had gone to celebrate Chandorkar's birthday at Karnali village in Raigad on Friday.

Locals blamed the national highway authorities for the delay in the highway work saying uneven carriageway crossing was being allowed, leading to confusion among drivers and mishaps.

Police have booked the bus driver, Kiran Nikan, who has been admitted to hospital with injuries. Following the mishap, traffic was hit on the Mumbai- bound carriageway and was diverted to the Goa-bound carriageway.

377,['20/01/2020'],"With netas fishing in CAA troubled waters, fissures in federalism may cost India","This story is from January 20, 2020

In the land of the Mahatma, violence is on the throne today. Its victims, among others, are helpless passengers in trains, loyal workers in strike-bound factories, and innocent citizens on riotstricken roads when the bandh-mongers claim the freedom of the city.”

This is not a view on the present atmosphere in the country riddled with anti-CAA protests. This was said by Nani A Palkhivala, the unparalleled legal luminary, way back in 1982 referring to the situation prevailing in India then. But these words are apt for today’s India, embittered by violence and political games. Palkhivala’s description of the 1980s India continues to hold even now. “Not since abolition of thuggery by Lord William Bentick in the 1830s has violence characterised our national life on a scale so widespread and so unchecked as today. Our legal system has made life too easy for criminals and too difficult for law-abiding citizens. A touch here and a push there, and India may become ungovernable under the present constitutional set-up,” he had said.

Right to protest is undeniably a fundamental right. But this right does not extend to destruction of public property, or to laying siege to roads to violate right to free access of people and rendering India ungovernable. This right does not extend to incite communal feelings. Sadly, these are methods often adopted by protesters and their sympathisers. Worse, even state governments have lent support to such activities.

The Kerala government has filed a suit under Article 131 making the Citizenship Amendment Act a Centre-state dispute. Punjab intends to follow suit. Is this in consonance with the federal structure envisaged by our Constitution?

Law teachers often said ‘India is a federal republic with a unitary bias’. In state of Rajasthan vs Union of India [1977 AIR 1361], a seven judge SC bench explained, “A conspectus of provisions of our Constitution will indicate that, whatever appearances of a federal structure our Constitution may have, its operations are certainly judged both by the contents of power which a number of its provisions carry with them and the use that has been made of them, more unitary than federal.”

Constitution’s principal architect BR Ambedkar, considered India to be “both unitary as well as federal according to the requirements of time and circumstances”. Over the years, the SC has settled the law and most political parties will agree with Palkhivala, who had said, “We do need a strong Union. But a strong Union is in no way inconsistent with strong states. On the contrary, by definition, a strong Union can only be a Union of strong states.”

The Left parties and Congress traditionally have had seasoned legal brains. When not in office, these two parties sink their differences and sniff for brewing troubles. Then they do their best to fan it. Remember the unprecedented press conference of ‘senior’ Supreme Court judges led by Justice Jasti Chelameswar in 2018?

Left leaders took full advantage of the chinks in the judiciary. They roped in willing legal brains of Congress to peddle canards in active connivance with activist lawyers and intellectuals. Together, they left no stone unturned to ridicule the judiciary, chisel down its stature and make every judge an object of suspicion.

The protests against CAA, as long as there is absence of a design to destabilise India through perpetration of violence, must get due space. But what we are witnessing is worrisome as violence has invariably accompanied protests.

When India was on the path of industrialisation under Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru , the then Union government through Parliament enacted a law in 1957 to acquire privately held coalfields, most of which were in West Bengal, to increase coal production. The Bengal government, claiming sovereign control over its land and minerals, moved the apex court with an Article 131 suit challenging the law.

The Bengal government argued, “States have within their allotted field full attributes of sovereignty and exercise of authority by Union agencies, legislative or executive, which trenches upon that sovereignty is void.” Rejecting the state’s suit against the Centre [1963 AIR 1241], the SC had said, “The executive power of every state has to be so exercised as to ensure compliance with the laws made by Parliament and any existing laws which apply in that state, and not to impede or prejudice the executive power of the Union.”

In 2004, when Congress-led UPA was in office at the Centre, the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh had filed a suit under Article 131 in the SC challenging the validity of Parliament-enacted MP Reorganisation Act on the issue of division of electricity board assets and dues after carving out of Chhattisgarh from Madhya Pradesh.

Disapproving a state government challenging the validity of a Parliament-enacted law through Article 131, the SC in ‘State of MP vs Union Of India’ on August 17, 2011, had said, “Normally, for questions relating to validity of central or other laws, the appropriate forum is the extraordinary writ jurisdiction under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution of India in a writ petition and not an original suit filed under Article 131 which vests exclusive jurisdiction of this court as regards disputes enumerated therein.”

The Supreme Court will again decide whether suits under Article 131 filed by Kerala challenging CAA, and Chhattisgarh challenging the National Investigation Agency Act, are maintainable in our federal structure of governance.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan has sought a report from the state government for moving the Supreme Court against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act without informing him. The chief secretary has been asked to submit a detailed reply “immediately”.

“Article 166 (3) of the Indian Constitution specifies that the chief minister and his government has to inform the governor about the government business,” Khan told reporters later. The state government had on January 13 moved the top court challenging the act and had sought to declare it as unconstitutional.

“It is not a personal fight between me and the government. I am not important. But what’s important is the Constitution and the law of the land… In many of its decisions, the Supreme Court has made it clear that the constitutional powers given to the governor are mandatory,” he said.

Khan said he could not remain a mute spectator.

“I will act to protect the Constitution. I will see to it that the rule of business is followed. What the government has done is in contravention of the act,” he said.

CHANDIGARH: Dumping its own plan to hire a private firm to help unemployed youths find jobs in foreign countries, the Punjab government has decided to directly play the role of facilitator by setting up its own placement cell.

The government dropped the plan fearing that a private firm might misuse the authority. The move has further delayed implementation of the plan the government was planning to roll out by mid-2019 to save youths from unscrupulous travel agents.

The firm was to assist 5,000 youths to move overseas annually. Now, the government will set up its own ‘foreign placement and study cell’ for which it has given itself a deadline of two months. Department of employment generation and training secretary Rahul Tewari said 10 experts would be deputed in the cell.

LUCKNOW: A group of women continued their protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at the Ghantaghar Park here on Sunday with some of them alleging that policemen took away their blankets, a charge dismissed by the police.

On the lines of Delhi's Shaheen Bagh, the women along with children have been squatting near the Clock Tower in Lucknow's old quarters protesting the CAA and National Register of Citizens.

The women protesters alleged that blankets provided to them by some organisations were taken away by police.

Rejecting the claims made by the women protesters, the Lucknow Police in a tweet said, ""During the illegal protest going on at Lucknow's Ghantaghar Park (Clock Tower), some people tried to make a 'gheraa' (cordon) using ropes and sticks, and also tried to put sheets. They were not allowed to do so. Some organisations were distributing blankets in park premises. As a result of which, people living in the vicinity, who are not part of the protests, were coming to take the blankets.""

""Police removed those persons and organisations distributing blankets there, and action is being initiated against them,"" the Lucknow Police said, and urged people not to spread rumours.

Lucknow's Police Commissioner Sujeet Pandey also dismissed the allegations levelled by the protesters.

A 27-second video clip emerged on social media which purportedly shows a policeman carrying blankets and sheets in a plastic bag. A woman could be seen in the video shouting at him and calling him ""thief"", but police personnel did not respond to it. The protest at Lucknow's Ghantaghar started Friday night.

The BJP said the protest by the women was ""sponsored by the Congress and the Samajwadi Party"".

UP BJP spokesperson Chandramohan in a statement said, ""The protest by the women is sponsored by the Congress and the Samajwadi Party. During the anti-CAA protests in December, unruly elements indulged in violence under the patronage of SP and Congress. The UP government acted tough on these unruly elements, and seized their property after identifying them. This action made the SP and the Congress agitated."" Chandramohan also said that the people have understood the activities of both these parties, and this is the reason that despite efforts of these parties, ""only a handful of Muslim women are staging protest."" pti

West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh

KOLKATA: Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said on Sunday 50-70 lakh “infiltrators” would be identified, their names struck off the voters’ list and sent back. He added the government was committed to implementing NRC nationwide and would send back Bangladeshi Muslims living here illegally.

Trinamool secretary general Partha Chatterjee said: “They (BJP leaders) are in a fight among themselves to outdo each other. The more they speak, it is better for us, people will get to know them better. They are teaching us Hinduism as if we need to learn from them. CM Mamata Banerjee has always stood up for people’s rights. In doing so, she has never for once thought about their religion, caste and creed. It is for people’s right she is fighting again. They may try to do politics with religion, but they will never succeed in Bengal. Their fight is about exclusivity, ours is about inclusivity.”

Ghosh’s comments came on a day his party MP Saumitra Khan termed intellectuals who oppose CAA as Baner-jee’s “dogs”, drawing fire from TMC leaders, who said “BJP leaders are trying to outpace each other in mouthing profanities”.

Subodh Sarkar, a recipient of Sahitya Akademi Award, said: “This is the actual language of BJP. Now, it is up to the people to decide.”

Ghosh continued his tirade against eminent personalities opposing CAA and NRC, saying their “hearts bleed for infiltrators”. “What about Hindu refugees? They don’t have any answers. This is double standards,” he said.

Elephants travel from Dalma to Bengal every year. In 2018-19 (till 31 March, 2019), 452 people were killed by ... Read More

KOLKATA: Elephant corridors from Dalma to Bengal have come in the way of an airport in Jharkhand.

An expert panel of the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) has recommended to put the proposed Dhalbhumgarh airport on hold because it will affect animal corridors and increase the risk of man-elephant conflict in the Bengal-Jharkhand border region. Around 100 hectares of reserve forests will have to be cleared to make way for the airport and its ancillaries, the panel noted.

The Airports Authority of India, in a joint venture with the Jharkhand government, was supposed to develop the airport on an abandoned WWII airfield — situated around 15km from the Bengal-Jharkhand border and around 60km from Jamshedpur — for fair-weather operations of ATR-72 aircraft. The total land required for the Rs 100-crore project is 97.2 hectares, of which 96.8 hectares falls within reserve forest area.

At its meeting in New Delhi on December 26 and 27, 2019, the expert appraisal committee (EAC) said the proposed forested site near Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary in Jharkhand is an elephant habitat. “Elephants travel from Dalma to Bengal through this forest. Every year, there are number of man-elephant conflict cases in these areas,” it said. The noise of aircraft and traffic movement will affect the elephants’ behaviour, it noted.

AAI regional executive director (east), S P Yadav, said: “The project was lined up by our corporate headquarters. I will enquire about the next course of action by them.”

In 2018-19 (till 31 March, 2019), 452 people were killed by elephants across the country. Of these, the maximum number of deaths (87) took place in Jharkhand. In Bengal, 52 human lives were lost in 2018-19 (till 31 March, 2019).

The AAI had sought forest clearance to “divert” (for 99 years) no less than 99.256 hectares of forest land (53.788 hectares of reserved forest, 0.065 hectares of protected forest and 45.403 hectares of unclassed forest). The total number of trees to be felled — the AAI’s forest clearance application (proposal No. FP/JH/Others/41404/2019) mentions — is 79,332. And wildlife present in that forest, according to the AAI’s application, include Asiatic elephant, indigenous and migratory birds, fox and wild cat.

“All around the proposed site, the only land available is reserved forest,” the committee noted. “Any kind of ancillary development which is bound to come up and further phase-2 development will also require land, which will only be forest land,” it added. The committee said since the proposed site is supposed to cater to Jamshedpur, creation of an airport at a site nearer to that town will be better.

The forest clearance application, filed on 31 July, 2019, is pending at the DFO/DCF level. Dhalbhumgarh DFO Abhishek Kumar said: “If the airport is built, it will affect the habitat of all wild animals here. And if elephant habitat is affected, that would increase the risk of man-elephant conflict.”

Conservationist Joydip Kundu said an airport at Dhalbhumgarh will result in fragmentation of forests and affect the migration routes of elephants. “Why can’t they find some other place to build an airport? Just because wild animals don’t have voting rights?”

387,['20/01/2020'],Penalty norms for delayed projects relaxed in Greater Noida,"This story is from January 20, 2020

The GNIDA has changed how it calculates money owed by developers, allowing them to pay penalties for delayed construction later. With this, cash-strapped builders can now seek funds from financial institutions or seek bailout packages.

“We will give permission to developers to seek mortgage from financial institutions as soon as they settle our core dues. Penalty on delayed construction will be charged later on. However, at the time of giving occupancy certificate, a committee will check if all the dues , including applicable construction penalty, had been settled,” said Narendra Bhooshan, the chief executive officer of GNIDA who approved the policy on Friday.

Premium for plot allotment and rent arrears make up the largest part of the dues. The Authority had started allotting plots in 2003. It has been revising its time extension policy, which covers penal provisions for delayed construction, from time to time. The Authority had charged 10% of the premium upfront and the remaining money was to be paid in instalments.

If a builder failed to finish a project in seven years, a monthly interest rate of 1-2% would be applicable. Since plots are given out on 90-year leases, the Authority also demanded rent. It had issued notices to developers who had not completed projects within deadline and had to pay their dues along with interest.

“This logjam led to a vicious cycle. It did not allow construction work over pending dues. Developers were not able to pay off the dues since projects got stuck and they received no money from buyers. The actual amount due from developers is much less than what is being claimed by the Authority. We raised this problem before the Authority and are glad that a positive decision has been taken,” said Manoj Gaur, chairman of CREDAI's affordable housing committee and managing director of Gaurs Group.

Several regulatory bodies sided with the developers because the construction delay, in many cases, took place as the Authority was unable to acquire the land and hand it over to the developers on time. The state government had passed an order in December last year extending benefits to such builders, like zero-period, and asked the authority to re-calculate the penal amount for construction delay accordingly.

Bhooshan said that during an assessment, it was found that 35,000 to 40,000 units could be completed if some builders could secure last-mile funding. Close to 1.25 lakh of the planned 2.5 lakh units in Greater Noida are yet to be delivered. About 42,000 flats of these were planned by the Amrapali group.GREATER NOIDA : The GNIDA has changed how it calculates money owed by developers, allowing them to pay penalties for delayed construction later.

The feast of Our Lady of Springs is celebrated on February 2

POINGUINIM: Just 15 devotees are likely to get permission from the state government to celebrate the feast of Our Lady of Springs at Anjediva island early next month.

Located off the coast of Canacona, the island is occupied by the Navy and has been out of bounds for devotees who seek to celebrate the feasts of Our Lady of Springs in February and St Francis de Assisi in October.

Suraj Naik, personal secretary of the minister of state for defence, Shripad Naik, on Tuesday informed Canacona resident Natividade D'Sa that at least 15 people would get permission to visit the island on February 2, the day of the feast. D'Sa, who has been pursuing the matter since June last year, was instructed to provide the names of the 15 devotees who would accompany him to the island.

D'Sa said he had received a call from Shripad Naik's office on Monday informing him that the minister of state for defence would meet him at Porvorim on Tuesday. However, the meeting did not take place as the minister had to leave for Delhi, he said.

The call for the meeting came after D'Sa filed an online complaint before the department of administrative reforms and public grievances, New Delhi, over permission to celebrate the two Catholic feasts at Anjediva island. The department had subsequently written to the South Goa collector, instructing that action be taken and the complainant intimated.

Deputy speaker and Canacona MLA Isidore Fernandes, on his part, said he would speak with the state's chief secretary to work out an amicable solution.

The Navy has denied citizens entry to Anjediva island since 2004 citing security concerns. The island has been handed over to the Navy for the Seabird project.

Family alleges rape, murder

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

NOIDA: A 20-year-old woman succumbed to injuries allegedly suffered during an accident on the Yamuna Expressway on Friday evening. However, an FIR for gang rape was registered by Noida police on Sunday after the woman’s family said she had suffered serious injuries to her private parts. An autopsy is likely to be conducted on Monday.Police said the woman worked as a helper at a watch manufacturing unit in Sector 68. On Friday, she had left for work along with a female colleague and had told her family that she would be back home by 9.30pm. But late that evening, her father got a call from his daughter’s colleague, informing him that she had been admitted to Kailash Hospital in Jewar following an accident.When the woman’s father reached the hospital, there were two men and his daughter’s friend. As her condition deteriorated, the woman was referred to GTB Hospital in Delhi.Doctors at Kailash told TOI they had treated the woman “as a case of accident”. Dr Naresh Kumar, a casualty medical officer who had attended to the woman first, said an ambulance deployed on the Yamuna Expressway had brought the woman to the hospital around 7.30 pm on Friday.Asked about the nature of her injuries, Dr Kumar said she had suffered fractures in the thighs and forehead, and abrasions on the forehead, left cheek and right hand. The doctor, however, said injuries to her private parts were not examined. “Since it was a case of accident, it was treated as such,” he said.Noida police officers, too, claimed the woman had met with an accident. They said the woman, her friend and the two men were travelling on two bikes and had stopped for some time at Naujhil area in Mathura district.“According to the complaint, there were four persons on two separate bikes. The accident occurred in Naujhil area. A team has gone to investigate that. Two persons have been named in the case,” DCP (zone I) Sankalp Sharma told a news conference. “They had halted on the highway when a car — possibly an i10 or an i20 — hit the woman,” the officer added.The woman’s family has alleged that their daughter had been gang-raped as there were serious injuries to her private parts. The father — a cab driver — has named the two men and the female colleague who had accompanied his daughter in the complaint.The woman’s family claimed they had been informed at GTB Hospital on Saturday that it was possibly a case of rape. “She was bleeding from her private parts and had to be infused blood. We suspect she was gang-raped,” her mother said.GTB Hospital could not be reached for an independent comment.The woman’s father has also levelled allegations of inaction against the police. He said when he reached Sector 49 police station on Saturday evening, the cops there declined to lodge a case of gang rape.“The cops there told us they would lodge an FIR according to the report of Kailash Hospital. They refused to take the complaint of gang rape,” he said.The woman died at GTB Hospital around 6am on Sunday. Delhi Police informed their Noida counterparts about her death. An FIR under IPC sections 376-D (gang rape), 302 (murder) and section 3 (2) (V) of the SC/ST Act was registered against the two men after around 100 people from the woman’s village flocked to the police station. The two men have been detained. One of them is the woman’s neighbour while the other stays in a nearby village. The police said though they had lodged a complaint of gang rape, they would wait for the autopsy to be conducted. An autopsy is only possible on Monday as Sunday is a holiday, the police said.At the news conference on Sunday, DCP Sharma took the name of the woman’s father at least twice, which threatened to reveal her identity. The officer, however, said he had named the complainant in the case.In Video: Noida: 20-yr-old woman dies, cops say accident while kin allege gang rape",noida,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73408785,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-136417,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/woman-dies-cops-say-its-accident-kin-allege-rape/articleshow/73397047.cms

KOCHI: Parts of Kochi, including Maradu, were hit by rain on Sunday night bringing much relief from the dust clouds arising from the post-demolition works at the site of the razed apartment complexes.The removal of debris of the apartment complexes is likely to start in seven days, Maradu municipality officials said, though uncertainty still looms over where it will be dumped. Workers of Vijay Steels and Explosives have been separating steel and concrete blocks of the four apartment complexes ever since the demolitions took place.The debris, removed from the sites, will be transported to a yard identified by the agency at Kumbalam, sources said, though Kumbalam panchayat president Seetha Chakrapani said no agency has approached the panchayat officials seeking permission to dump the debris in the panchayat. She also reiterated that they would not allow any agency to dump the debris in their panchayat.At the same time, Prompt Enterprises, the agency selected for transporting the debris, said Vijay Steels and Explosives will inform them when the waste should be transported from the sites.Prompt Enterprises will present before the Pollution Control Board (PCB) and technical committee members in Thiruvananthapuram on Monday its mode of transportation of debris, recycling process and slurry management. Only then the PCB will give the temporary authorization for debris removal .""The agency needs PCB's consent for disposing of and recycling the debris. They should make it clear, where the debris would be stored, how long will it take to remove the debris, how they will recycle the debris and how the slurry will be removed,"" said a PCB official. Meanwhile, technical committee members and PCB officials said they could not reach near the debris of the second tower of Alfa Serene, some of which have fallen into backwaters.""Currently, we can't remove the debris of the second tower. There is no space in the compound to dump the waste. We can start removing the debris of the second tower only after the site of first tower is cleared. A bank guarantee issued by Vijay Steels and Explosives is with Maradu municipality. It will be released only after the agency clear the debris. The issue over dumping debris at Kumbalam should be addressed by the municipality itself,"" said another PCB official.Kumbalam panchayat president said the local body is a small area surrounded by waterbodies. ""Why should we bear the brunt of demolition of the buildings at Maradu municipality? They have more space to store debris. We don't have space and our local body consists of only 18 wards. The municipality should have identified the place earlier before demolishing the buildings, said Chakrapani.On Friday, Maradu municipality officials and special officer sub-collector Snehil Kumar Singh will appear before the state-level monitoring committee constituted by the National Green Tribunal to give an explanation on debris removal.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73406796,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-599723,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kochi-debris-removal-to-begin-in-a-week/articleshow/73406587.cms

400,['20/01/2020'],Canadian jobs menu could have Indian cooks salivating,"What’s cooking in Canada? For starters, it could be greater job opportunities for cooks, albeit with stiff competition. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), the government agency that oversees immigration to Canada, recently tweeted an article that featured Indian-origin chef Hemant Bhagwani.""He’s opened over 40 restaurants in Toronto and is now embarking on another hospitality journey—bringing skilled chefs to Canada and creating jobs,” the tweet stated, using the hashtag #ImmigrationMatters.This doesn’t come as a surprise, given that the demand for cooks is high in Canada. Job-bank data available on a government agency website indicates, “For cooks, over the period 2017-2026, new job openings (arising from expansion demand and replacement demand) are expected to total 52,200.”While this spells good news, the data also indicates that the available supply—expected at 58,600 (arising from new qualified students and immigration) will result in a marginal surplus. This means stiff competition for those chefs aspiring to migrate to Canada in search of employment. However, those with an entrepreneurial streak can set up their own restaurants, as having a job offer is not mandatory for migration purposes. It’s likely that the Express Entry point-based immigration system will be a tough egg to crack, at least for some aspirants.“I had always dreamed of having my own business, specifically restaurants. However, I would not have become an entrepreneur without the Canadian government’s ‘Small Business Loan’ programme. This programme really supports the small business owner, provided that their homework is done, paperwork is in order and a clear business plan is in place,” Bhagwani told TOI.In 1999, when he moved to Canada, Indian food was looked down upon as most Indian restaurants were not up to par with others. He narrated: “I wanted to elevate the status of Indian food, and I wanted to serve it in a fine dining setting. That is exactly what I set out to do.” Since 2002, he has opened 49 restaurants with brands like Amaya, Kamasutra, Indian Street Food Co, Goa Indian Farm Kitchen and Good Karma.The Express Entry point-based immigration system was introduced in January, 2015 to enable skilled immigrants to work and obtain a permanent residency (which is akin to a US green card). Three economic immigration categories are covered by the Express Entry system—the Federal Skilled Worker Class, Canadian Experience Class and the Federal Skilled Trades Class.“A cook is considered a skilled occupation, under the Express Entry. Further a cook may be eligible for any of the three economic migration categories, each of which have different eligibility requirements,” David Cohen, senior partner at the immigration law firm of Campbell Cohen, told TOI.Bhagwani explains how he helps chefs migrate. “We get the chefs here on work permits (under the Express Entry route), after obtaining Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) under the high wage stream. The salary rate is Canadian $23-25 an hour. This kind of LMIA supports permanent residence applications.”Later he helps the chefs master requisite language skills to enable them to qualify for permanent residence. The Ontario Immigration Nominee Program, the province’s economic immigration programme, which works in partnership with IRCC has also come in handy.He has helped nearly 60 cooks in their immigration journey and as expansion of business is on the cards, several more will be hired over the next few years.“Experience and the skills are more important for ethnic cuisines than formal educational qualifications. Several years of experience in commercial food preparation establishments is a must,” said Bhagwani.Under the Express Entry point based system, candidates complete an online profile and are given a Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score. The CRS score is divided into two portions based on various parameters and a maximum of 600 points can be earned under each portion.Post getting a score, candidates are placed in the Express Entry pool and ranked relative to each other. Those who rank above the cut-off score get invited to apply for migration.“The cut-off is interesting when it comes to an occupation like a cook. In November 2016, the government of Canada reduced the additional points a candidate receives for an eligible offer of arranged employment from 600 to 200 points for a senior management level position; and from 600 to 50 points for other skilled positions. This means that a cook with a CRS score of 250 who obtained an eligible job offer would see his or her score climb to 850, but now it will only increase to 300,” explains Cohen.This change has had its fallout. Cohen illustrates this by saying: “If you look at the 2015 Express Entry year-end report, ‘cook’ was the second most invited occupation, with 2,295 invites being issued (8% of total invitations). In 2017, cooks ranked much lower down at 28, with just 853 invites (1% of total invitations).“For those aspiring to migrate under this occupational category, some of the steps may be claiming all the CRS points they are entitled to—say, by improving their qualification, or by pursuing Express Entry-aligned provincial nominee programmes which provides an additional 600 points,” he added.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73413945,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-454232,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/canadian-jobs-menu-could-have-indian-cooks-salivating/articleshow/73406617.cms

LONDON: The peers in the House of Lords may be moved up to the city of York or Birmingham in the north of England while the parliament complex in London undergoes an extensive refurbishment programme in the coming years.

According to ‘The Sunday Times’, British PM Boris Johnson is contemplating the move and has ordered a review into the practicalities. It is seen as part of his post-election pledge to better engage with voters from the traditionally Labour Party heartlands in the north of England, who voted Conservative and handed him a landslide win last December. Besides the Lords, Johnson also plans to hold temporary touring sessions of the House of Commons in different parts of the country. “The York proposal is much further along. The PM is also keen to have parliamentary sessions in the regions, be it Sunderland or Manchester , so people get a chance to feel democracy in action first hand,” a government source was quoted by the newspaper as saying.

The Conservative Party has already announced that its campaign headquarters will move out of London.

PANAJI: The state government's River Rejuvenation Committee (RRC-Goa) has approved the revised action plans for stretches of the Mandovi and the Sal rivers, which involve expediting the installation of a sewerage network and strengthening the institutional mechanism for solid waste management. RRC-Goa has also decided to 'de-list' the Talpona river stretch from the list of eleven polluted river stretches in the state.

The revised action plan would be submitted to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for approval as per the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order. ""There is no industrial discharge into any of the polluted river stretches,"" a senior government officer said.

Interventions listed in the action plan are being monitored on regular basis through the department of panchayats (DoP) , the department of municipal administration (DMA), public works department (PWD) and the directorate of health services (DHS).

The Goa state pollution control board (GSPCB) has levied fines under the 'polluter pays principle' (PPP) to commercial establishments located along the banks of the Mandovi for the release of untreated sewage, with instructions to provide sewage-treatment methodology withi

With respect to the Talpona river, on-site interventions by the DoP- through the improvement of institutional mechanism in solid-waste management, by the DHS, through the issuance of notices against violators for illegal discharge of sewage, and the PWD, which disconnected electricity and water connections of violators, along with continual monthly monitoring of water quality by the board from April upto October 2019 has shown that the water quality parameters like pH , dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and total coliform have improved, and are within the CPCB-prescribed parameters. The Goa Waste Managegement Corporation will provide bio toilets. Therefore, the Talpona no longer qualifies as a 'polluted river stretch' as per the criteria stipulated by the CPCB.

For the river Sal, the interventions being executed include the laying of a sewerage network, the diversion of Sirvodem and Khareband nullahs through SIDCGL, the de-silting of a polluted-stretch by the Captain of Ports and the provision of toilet facilities at fish-landing sites, that is being executed by the department of fisheries.

GREATER NOIDA: Some ran to test their endurance, some as part of their daily fitness regime. But old and young alike, 700 people participated in the Greater Noida mini marathon on Sunday morning. The event was hosted by Bennett University and was flagged off from the city park in Alpha sector.The race started at 10am and ended by noon. The contest was held in two categories — 2km for senior citizens and 10km for others, said Sachin Jain, president of Bennett University. At the end of the race, prizes were handed out to the top three runners in both the categories.Jain said, “We are committed towards academic excellence at our institute. Through this initiative, we have achieved a bond and initiated an engagement with residents. This shows our commitment towards community development.”The winners expressed happiness. “It was a great day for me. I won the race and got a prize of Rs 25,000. I will be using this money for my running practice,” said Lakashiya Kashyap, the winner in the 10km category.For Renu Bohra, the top woman sprinter, sweating it out on a wintry morning was difficult. But she turned up anyway. “It was a great experience for all the participants. It was not easy for people to turn up on a winter morning, but sheer determination helped,” she said.While inaugurating the event, Narendra Bhooshan, the CEO of Greater Noida Authority, said, “Greater Noida is unique, organised, clean and green. It will emerge as one of the top cities in the country because of industrial units, road connectivity and the airport (at Jewar). We are working towards making this city smart and happy. This event is a gesture to involve citizens and work towards their happiness.”Alok Singh, the commissioner of police, also flagged off the marathon. He spoke about how his force planned to make the city safer.“Noida and Greater Noida residents are technology-driven and we will give them smart policing support. We have identified 150 spots for installing CCTV cameras and close monitoring of streets. Additionally, more than 90 choke points have been identified and we will resolve traffic issues there.

Several villages have also set up wet waste disposal facilities

PANAJI: All 191 village panchayats in the state have started door-to-door collection of dry waste, which is then sent to Goa Waste Management Corporation (GWMC) for scientific disposal, said the directorate of panchayats (DoP). A majority of village panchayats dispose wet waste at source, the directorate added.

Panchayats have issued 3,273 notices to houses across the state for direct or indirect discharge of waste water into rivers, the DoP said.

Panchayat have constructed sheds to store the dry waste before it sent to GWMC.

Altogether, 64 village panchayats in close proximity to municipal jurisdictions, tourist spots and semi-urban areas generate wet waste, of which 37 village panchayats carry out door-to-door collection of wet waste. 28 village panchayats send their wet waste to the Saligao plant and the other nine have set up their own wet waste disposal facilities. The DoP said 12 village panchayats have land available for setting up wet waste disposal facilities, which are under way and will becompleted within 6 months. The remaining 15 village panchayats are in the process of identifying land for the purpose, and will require a period of one year to set up treatment facilities.

127 village panchayats have mostly single dwelling units, which dispose of their wet waste at source.

Of the 3,273 violators, the DoP said 1,451 violators have constructed soak pits and 1,788 residents were in the process of constructing soak pits or septic tanks. The directorate of health services disconnected the water connections to 34 households for non-compliance, on request of the village panchayats under the Public Health Act.

The DoP said 264 bulk waste generators were identified by the village panchayats, out of which 218 bulk waste generators have set up wet waste disposal facilities and the remaining 46 are in the process of setting up the facilities.

All village panchayats have prepared the village waste management plan and submitted it to GWMC. The panchayats will strictly execute the plan prepared for proper collection, transportation and scientific disposal of waste.

DoP said all 191 village panchayats have taken the decision at their gram sabhas to ban plastic of 50 microns and below. For strict compliance, enforcement through imposing penalties is regularly done by the village panchayat secretaries, and public awareness campaigns are conducted to educate the people about the ban on plastic of 50 microns and below.

‘Laws mustn’t look at biz with suspicion’

CHENNAI: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday said she had sought an assessment of the full year collection of goods and services tax ( GST ) before rationalising rates, indicating that a proposal by a panel of officers to increase levies may wait until April.The minister also advised against frequent change in rates, which had become the norm at every meeting of the GST Council, which is headed by the union finance minister, with states being members of the panel. The GST Council is the final decision-making body on rates and rules and has to meet at least once in three months.There is a proposal for reworking the slab and increase rates on several items — ranging from branded food items to mobile phones and economy class air travel. But a decision was deferred as states wanted an assessment of the impact of the new indirect tax regime on various products. Besides, many states, including those ruled by BJP , were not in favour of increasing rates under various slabs.At the Palkhiwala Centenary Celebration here, Sitharaman raised concerns over assessment of GST collections. “Ideally, everybody keeps telling that we must aim for one rate (GST), one tax, and one nation and so on. However, before we make such revisions, have we studied what the current rates have given us (collection) steadily for one full year?”The minister indicated that there were suggestions for an annual revision. “We did consider if the revision of rates could be a yearly exercise, which will be done after due consideration. However, if the technical, law, and fitment committees come back saying that such reduction would lead to an inversion, then all of us must have the largeness of heart to say — sorry, this (rate revision) cannot happen.”The FM raised complaints that every GST Council meeting, there is a big list of rate reduction on items, which even leads to discussions on changes in inverted duty structure.Sitharaman said the government is moving towards a direction where the law does not look at business enterprises with suspicion. She also said the industry and the government should work together to take the country’s economy to $5 trillion.The FM said her earnest attempt is to decriminalise matters concerning the Companies Act or other related laws, and also cited Tata Group head N Chandrasekharan’s speech in Mumbai on Monday, where he had said the government should trust its own citizens.Stressing further on the trust factor, Sitharaman said the government’s intention is not to distrust business houses and the road to $5-trillion economy will be much easier with mutual trust.(Agencies)",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73413125,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-103498,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/fm-hints-at-status-quo-on-gst-rates/articleshow/73406945.cms

Locals object to the work

VASCO: Tensions ran high during the annual inspection of the South Western Railway (SWR) with Cortalim MLA Alina Saldanha taking offence to statements made by SWR manager Ajay Kumar Singh on Sunday.

Saldanha was at the Vasco railway station along with panchayat members and the Cansaulim sarpanch to raise objections to the double tracking of the railway, on Sunday evening. During the interaction, Singh tried to impress upon the MLA that he is only a technical party and has no powers to decide on the work.

When Saldanha told him that many houses would face demolition, Singh said that in India many houses have been demolished. He added that they would be given compensation like others. Saldanha pointed out that these are 500-year-old heritage houses, to which Singh replied, ""India has houses that are 5,000 years old. Goans were the invading force who came about 500 years back. When you all came, you all also must have destroyed houses here."" He quickly added, ""By you I meant Portuguese.""

An angry Saldanha said, ""I am an Indian, I am not Portuguese, I take strong objection to your statement."" Singh then withdrew his statement.

Singh later told reporters that it all depends on the Centre and the local administration. ""If they ask us to stop we will stop the work. We are not Mughals, Britishers or Portuguese. We don't have an army. If the extension is not required we will stop it. But the government should tell us.""

Commenting on Singh's statement, she said, ""This is why Goans are taken for granted. They feel we are Portuguese, so who cares for them, only Indians should be cared for. But we are Indians. His statement was definitely wrong.""

Singh had come from Hubballi division. He stopped at 10 stations.

429,['20/01/2020'],"Budget 2020: Government must be transparent, reveal real fiscal deficit in Budget: Experts","(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: Amid calls for easing the fiscal deficit target to boost spending and accelerate growth, experts, including NITI Aayog , have urged the government to be transparent in revealing the actual deficit rather than resort to below the line and offbudget numbers to show a better picture.“If you take into account the Centre, states and PSUs, the off-budget items, the deficit is much higher than budgeted,” said a source, adding that the advice of the government think tank is to come clean on the deficit, which is a measure of the Centre’s net borrowings.Against the backdrop of a slowdown in the economy , growth is estimated at 5% in 2019-20, the slowest pace in 11 years, and there have been calls to ease the deficit target. The government aims to rein in the deficit at 3.3% of GDP in the current financial year, which ends in March. But sluggish revenues and spending commitments have already seen reaching 112.4% of the full-year Budget target of Rs 6.2 lakh crore at the end of December.Receipts from stake sale in state-run companies have also not taken off and there is a likelihood of the government missing the target of raising Rs 1.05 lakh crore from asset sales in the current fiscal. This has also triggered worries that the fiscal deficit target may be breached.“There is a need to be transparent and not resort to offline, below-the-lines items to suppress the real deficit. This will comfort everybody,” the source said, adding that the government may ease the target to step up spending at a time when reviving growth is a top priority. There is a section within the government which is of the view that the government need not be rigid about sticking to the deficit target at a time when growth revival has emerged as a number one priority.Former finance secretary Subhash Chandra Garg has estimated the fiscal deficit to widen to 3.7% to 4% of GDP in the current financial year.

Representative image

PANAJI: Observing that the offence of possessing commercial quantity of drugs is of a ""very serious nature"" and that there is every possibility that the accused may not return, a sessions judge recently turned down the request of a French national to have his passport returned.

The French national, Olmeta Regis Rene, sought the return of his passport and permission to travel to France for two months to visit his elderly parents, and produced photographs showing an elderly person hospitalised. He stated he had come to Goa for a short period and required to return to France.

""However, the request cannot be granted, instead the matter can be disposed of and in the event the applicant is acquitted, he can very well be deported to his native place,"" the court stated.

Sessions judge Irshad Agha observed that in most cases, accused persons who are of foreign origin deliberately commit some offence so that their stay in Goa is extended, and in most of these cases, their passport is not made available.""In the present case, the application was filed for returning of the passport,"" judge Agha said. ""Since there is every possibility that the accused may not return to Goa, the application filed on behalf of the accused cannot be accepted.""

An FIR was registered against Rene by ANC in 2018 after the French national was caught in Anjuna with 4.5g of LSD, a commercial quantity.

VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy has reportedly decided to scrap the legislative council . The CM has reportedly told the law department to prepare a draft bill withdrawing the council. The bill is likely to be tabled in the assembly session beginning on Monday.Jagan has taken the decision to abolish the upper house following the TDP rejecting the bills passed by the legislative assembly. The TDP has absolute majority in the 58-member legislative council, and it had rejected bills related to the introduction of English as medium of instruction at government schools in the winter session held in December.As there is no scope of YSR Congress getting majority in the near future to get the bills passed smoothly, Jagan has decided to abolish the council. The law department has already prepared a draft bill, and sent it to the CM for consideration late on Sunday evening.This would be the second time that the AP legislative council is being abolished. Interestingly, it was first abolished in 1985, when the TDP had come to power and the Congress had the majority in the council. Former chief minister K Rosaiah was the leader of the house then, and Congress gave a tough time to the TDP government headed by NT Rama Rao.However, the council was restored in 2007, by Jagan's father and then CM, late YS Rajasekhar Reddy, before going for the 2009 general election. Though YSR Congress has absolute majority in the legislative assembly - 151 of 175 members - it is finding tough to get bills passed by legislative council. TDP, led by senior politician Yanamala Ramakrishnudu, is giving a tough time to the Jaganmohan Reddy government in the council.As Jagan is likely to table important bills, including decentralisation of capital and abolition of APCRDA Act, and there is no possibility of the bills getting the approval in the council, the CM has decided to abolish the council in this session.Besides having majority, the council chairman and vice-chairman posts are also held by TDP members, which is also seen as a reason for Jagan to abolish the house.",vijayawada,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73407363,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-409943,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ys-jaganmohan-reddy-may-scrap-legislative-council/articleshow/73407285.cms

KOCHI: With the yachting season about to start, the Kochi International Marina is set to witness an increase in the inflow of foreign yachts. But the absence of annual maintenance and poor infrastructure lead to the decline of marina's popularity among international yachters even though the yachting community considers it a gateway to Red Sea Passage. Though around 12 yachts are anchored at the marina currently, problems including shallow berths, broken docks and cleats, poor lighting and intrusion of public are still concerns for yachters.

Kerala Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC), which owns the property, and Ocean Blue Boating Pvt Ltd, which runs it, remain idle. Yachters said the image of Kochi Marina is getting tarnished among global yachting community and they will soon be forced to declare it unsafe for sailors in yachting blogs and websites.

""For those yachters preferring passage through Suez Canal, the Kochi Marina is the only nearest port of call. Despite the call for a complete overhaul of the marina, which is close to the international maritime route with favourable conditions and minimum tidal variations throughout the year, KTDC is not making any investment in the project,"" said a marina official.

Yachters too said their complaints went unheard. ""The wooden planks on the dock have decayed posing threat to sailors walking on it. Ocean Blue did not respond to my requests to fix it and when I went to the officials at Bolgatty, some minor action took place mostly to appease me. They patched the holes on the dock leading to our boat using aluminium sheets however, did nothing to the other docks. All of the sailboats are stuck in the mud at low tides and the dock steel pilings are rusted, broken and covered with barnacles. I think this marina will completely fall apart in a couple of years. Blogs about its poor condition is spreading in community blogs,"" said Wade Alarie, a Canadian sailor, who has been at the marina for 10 months.

""We sailors wonder what happens to the money, around Rs 26,000, paid by each yacht monthly to continue our boat's anchorage at the marina,"" said a sailor from Germany.

KTDC chairman M Vijayakumar said lack of funds has been a problem. ""Last two years, post floods, have been troubling for KTDC due to fund crunch. Marina's upkeep will be a priority this year,"" he said.

Mauvin Godinho

PANAJI: No sooner the FIR was registered in the Merces panch Prakash Naik death case, Congress demanded that BJP minister Mauvin Godinho immediately step down from the cabinet to ensure an impartial investigation into the death. Godinho's brother, Wilson was named in the FIR.

""We demand that Mauvin should immediately step down from the cabinet, or chief minister Pramod Sawant should sack him to ensure that the investigation in the case is impartial, and the one found responsible for the crime should be punished,"" Goa Pradesh Congress Committee president Girish Chodankar stated.

If Godinho doesn't step down from the cabinet, the party demanded that the chief minister should sack him so that those involved can be punished.

""It is obvious that there would be political pressure on the investigating officer as Godinho is a senior member in the cabinet,"" Chodankar stated.

The party hit out at the minister for defecting to BJP from Congress, and alleged he did so to ""get out of corruption charges levelled against him in the past by the same party"".

""The death also indicates how the land mafia has been operating in the state under BJP-led government's rule. A detailed investigation into this incident can help police unearth a larger conspiracy. But for that, the police should be provided a free hand,"" the state Congress president said.

Police had said that Naik allegedly shot himself dead at his residence in Merces on Friday minutes after posting a message on WhatsApp that he was ""under tremendous pressure"" from two persons over a property matter, which he could not ""handle"".

In the message, the former Merces sarpanch and sitting panch had stated he was tired of everything in life because of the ""harassment"" with regards to a garden at Voilem Bhat in Merces, police said.

He also said the two persons should compensate his family with Rs 2 crore, police said.

435,['20/01/2020'],HCL among top 10 global software companies: CEO,"This story is from January 20, 2020

HCL CEO C Vijayakumar (File photo)

BENGALURU: If there’s a bellwether in the Indian IT services industry today, it will probably have to be HCL Technologies . The company made bold bets in infrastructure services, engineering services, and products & platforms. The first two paid off handsomely. The third too looks to be heading in the same direction.

So, even as some peers struggle, HCL continues to grow at a scorching pace. In the last 14 quarters, HCL’s revenue has grown from $6.4 billion to $9.7 billion (last 12 months’ basis), a 12% CAGR. That changed the pecking order in the Indian IT services landscape — HCL overtook Wipro in the 2019 fiscal to become the third-biggest company.

Over the same 14 quarters, its revenue per employee grew 14% CAGR to $68,000 — the highest in the industry. Some of the revenue growth is on account of acquisitions, but the buys — such as the $1.8-billion purchase of certain IBM products — are delivering results.

“We have a very unique position in the industry,” HCL CEO C Vijayakumar tells TOI in an exclusive interaction. “We created a software products business that did close to $340 million in revenue last quarter, which means we are at a $1.3-billion annualised run rate. Three years ago, we didn’t have this business. The software products business is the most attractive profit pool in the tech industry. In IT services, infrastructure and digital continue to be strong service lines. We have a leadership position in engineering services. So today, we would be among the top 10 software companies in the world,” he says.

But wouldn’t parts of the products portfolio be vulnerable to cloud and newer technologies? Would the IBM products be a long-term paying proposition? Vijayakumar says it’s the traditional application support and maintenance business — the mainstay of IT services companies — that is the most vulnerable today. As many applications are moving to SaaS or moving to an agile development method, there’s very little of pure-play support, he says.

HCL’s software business, he says, helped the products and platforms business to grow 16.8% sequentially in constant currency in the December quarter. “While we were very confident about our business model and strategy in the products and platforms space, this quarter has established in a very convincing way that our strategy is really playing out,” he says.

The IBM products it bought included one for secure application development, for secure device management, for marketing automation, for omnichannel e-commerce, for digital experience, for email and lowcode rapid application development, and for workstream collaboration. Many of these are onpremise applications.

Vijayakumar says though HCL’s big business of infrastructure management services is under pressure due to automation, there are still large parts of the market that have not been penetrated by outsourcing players. Support for infrastructure, he says, will continue as a lot of it is getting modernised. Increased cloud adoption is also putting a lot of demand on the network and HCL sees a big opportunity there to transform the network landscape. “As global players are getting weakened in this space, it opens a world of new opportunities,” he says.

Jalees Ansari aka 'Dr Bomb'

LUCKNOW: Two days after Indian Mujahideen (IM) operative Jalees Ansari aka ' Dr Bomb ' was arrested by UP Special Task Force from Kanpur after he jumped parole from Ajmer prison, intelligence agencies revealed the 68-year-old convict was fine-tuning bomb-manufacturing techniques during his 21-day freedom.

A resident of Mumbai, Dr Bomb, was convicted for his role in the 1993 Ajmer blasts. He's also accused of masterminding 50 other explosions, including the Mumbai serial blasts. STF sleuths grilled Ansari for over eight hours on the purpose of his visit to Kanpur, before handing him over to Maharashtra ATS on 3-day transit remand. ""He was the tech handle of Indian Mujahideen and specialised in making bombs to cause maximum damage through low-intensity explosions,"" said a senior STF officer.

Ansari first used cycles to set off explosives packed in a tiffin box at Chandpole area of Ajmer, making it the bombing trademark of IM. Since it's easy to buy cycles without registration or paper work, it was the best choice for carrying out blasts, the STF officer said.

Officiating senior superintendent of police, STF, Vishal Vikram Singh, said, ""We have recovered a diary from Ansari in which he drew a list of cheap bomb ingredients from web links. During interrogation, Ansari only spoke about bomb-making and nothing else. We are also probing whether he was in touch with relatives in Sant Kabir Nagar. His call details during parole are being scanned,"" said the officer.

Later, UP ATS unit also questioned Ansari for several hours during which he enquired about the whereabouts of friends and other acquaintances in Kanpur and other UP districts.

Dr Bomb has 5 brothers - Anish who works in a plastic store shop, Raees a contractor, Laik a physics professor in Bandra, Zulfikar a civil engineer and Firoz makes plastic equipment.

Gulrez taxi driver, Javed civil engineer, Musab runs a general store.

HYDERABAD: Telangana high court on Sunday directed the state and its police to furnish evidence within four days that arrested Osmania University (OU) associate professor Chintakindi Kaseem has links with Maoists. The Siddipet police brought Kaseem to the Chief Justice's residence on Sunday after the CJ had threatened to order a CBI inquiry against the police if they failed to produce him.

""These days the police are arresting several people in the name of being Maoist sympathisers. Now even professors are not being spared. Is the state trying to crush dissent this way by using its domain power,"" asked Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan, who along with Justice Abhishek Reddy, was hearing a house motion moved by Telangana Civil Liberties Committee seeking Kaseem's production before the court.

Kaseem was arrested early on Saturday from his official residence on campus. Since October 4, 2019, 17 people have been arrested in Telangana for alleged links with Maoists.

""Show us evidence that he collected money from businessmen and used that to propagate Maoist ideology. Provide us evidence about his alleged travel to Chhattisgarh to participate in Maoist meetings,"" Chief Justice Chauhan told advocate general BS Prasad, who said there were six FIRs against Kaseem, including the current one and all mentioned his involvement in Maoist programmes.

The CJ recorded Kaseem's statement and directed authorities to consider his request to shift him to Cherlapalli prison from Sangareddy jail where he was remanded by a trial court.

The Class IX student, whose father has been working in Russia for the past several years as a wielder, called his mother from his cellphone on Saturday and told her that he was kidnapped for Rs 15 lakh ransom. The juvenile from a village under Motipur police station area in Muzaffarpur was living with his maternal uncle at Raza Bazar under Shastri Nagar police station area in the state capital to pursue his studies in a private school.

His mother reached Shastri Nagar police station from Muzaffarpur in the evening and lodged a kidnapping case.

Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said the minor boy went to Varanasi by a train but returned as he was left with little money. Sharma said he would be charged for extortion from his mother in connivance with Amit, who was sent to jail.

The SSP said the juvenile told his mother around midnight that the kidnappers had released him near Patna Junction after noting his name and other details. ""His sole purpose was to purchase a sports bike worth over Rs2 lakh for enjoyment. Besides, he had planned to invest in real estate after giving Rs1 lakh to Amit,"" he said.

Lord Venkateswara temple at Tirumala. (File photo)

TIRUPATI: Starting Monday, the Tirupati laddu will be issued free of cost to devotees on pilgrimage to the sacred abode of Lord Venkateswara at Tirumala. On December 31, 2019, the temple administration had announced that it would issue one laddu free of cost to every devotee visiting the temple, beginning January 20.

This decision is being set into action with the launch of 'one free Tirupati laddu for every devotee scheme' at the Tirumala temple , from Monday.

Speaking to TOI, TTD's additional EO AV Dharma Reddy said that a free laddu would be issued to every devotee, regardless of whether they were a VIP or common devotee. ""All devotees are equal before the almighty and everyone will be entitled to receive one free Tirupati laddu once they complete darshan.""

The additional EO also clarified that the temple administration was not hiking the price of the laddu. ""The price for one laddu is still 50. We have just decided to cancel the issuance of laddus at subsidised prices,"" he clarified. Till recently, TTD provided free laddus only to divya darshan devotees daily. For others, the laddus were sold at subsidised prices. With the new scheme, the temple administration will have done away with these subsidies, which had also led to a black market business thriving at the temple town.

According to sources, even after issuing one free laddu to every devotee, the temple administration will save 250 crore per annum by removing the subsidies. Availing additional laddus has also become easier. Devotees can now buy additional laddus from counters next to where they get the free laddu. TTD has set up 12 additional laddu token counters, where devotees can buy additional laddus by paying 50 per laddu.

Protesters conducted a ‘funeral’ prayer with a ‘corpse’ of Aravalis.

GURUGRAM: Dressed in white, more than 100 residents gathered at Sikanderpur metro station on Sunday to carry out the ‘funeral rites’ of the Aravalis in protest against the Punjab Land Preservation (Haryana Amendment) Act ( PLPA ), 2019 and continuous destruction of forest in the state.

The protesters marched from Sikanderpur metro station to MG Road metro station. They conducted a janaaza (funeral prayer) with a symbolic ‘corpse’ of the Aravalis, and demanded immediate withdrawal of the Act and protection of the forest cover in the region.

Residents from across the city, including women, college students and children, raised slogans like “Withdraw PLPA Amendment Act”, “Aravali bachao”, and “Stop illegal constructions in our forests” during the protest.

“The amendment to PLPA, which has been signed by the Haryana governor, is the death knell for our forests. If notified, 60,000 acres of protected forest in the Aravalis and 10,000 acres of forest in the Shivaliks near Chandigarh will be opened up for real estate development. This amounts to a loss of 33% of forests when the state already has the lowest cover in India – barely 3.62% as compared to the national average of 20%,” said Dr Sarika Verma, an ENT surgeon and a Gurgaon resident. ”Having come from Gujarat, I grew up in the lap of the Aravalis. Delhi and NCR’s air pollution will worsen if there is construction in the Aravalis,” said Anurag, a student from Delhi University.

The residents demanded setting up of a task force to check encroachment and increasing Haryana’s forest cover to 5% in the next five years.

Dilapidated condition of one of the key slip roads in Sector 23 of Gurugram

GURUGRAM: Sector 23 residents have raised concerns about the dilapidated condition of one of the key slip roads in the area. According to residents, a 3-km stretch connecting Rezang La Chowk to Major Sushil Aima Marg and further to Old Delhi-Gurugram road has been neglected by the authorities.

Residents and commuters, especially those commuting on two-wheelers, complained of physical injuries and back pain on a regular basis due to the poor condition of the slip road. The road is full of big potholes and is usually waterlogged as the sewer line adjacent to it is choked, they said.

“I have tweeted about this issue a couple of times. This road has been broken for more than one year. There are numerous potholes which are over one foot deep. Water always accumulates in them whenever it rains or sewer lines get choked,” said Bhawani Shankar, a resident.

He added, “Last year, labourers poured concrete on one of the potholes during repair work, making a huge mound in the middle of the road that resulted in vehicles being damaged. It also made it difficult for two-wheelers to pass through. The problem will always remain as the road is at a lower level from both the connecting roads — Old Delhi road and Sushil Aima Marg. This entire part needs redesigning, especially because this road is soon going to have tracks for the RRTS line from Sarai Kale Khan to Manesar.”

Sector 23A RWA president Malkhan Singh said the responsibility of maintaining roads lies primarily with the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA). “We have approached both the municipal corporation and GMDA over the matter. Sometimes, we are told that they plan to convert the divider into a green belt, but that is a minor issue. The drain running along this slip road is also choked and not levelled. Since it’s an important road in the sector, even officials of the administration travel through it every other day. They are very much aware of the issues residents are facing for over the past 1.5 years, but we have no clarity on who will repair the road and when,” he added.

Another resident, Devendra Kaushik, said he has never seen the road in a good condition. “Even when it isn’t raining, the road is always flooded. If one avoids going by this broken road, then they are stuck for a good 40-45 minutes at the intersection ahead. The slip road is important for traffic coming from both Kapashera and the Palam Vihar flyover,” he said.

GMDA officials refused to comment on the matter.

Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said Pankaj's maternal cousin Avinash Pandey was the main conspirator of the murder.

Paliganj SDPO Manoj Kumar Pandey said while Avinash is a resident of Sabbalpur village under the Doriganj police station area in Chhapra town, Vishal hails from Dilawarpur and Tunnu from Lai village under Bihta police station area. Bajrangi, on the other hand, hails from Rohtas district.

""All the four accused are relatives of Pankaj. Investigations revealed that Vishal and Bajrangi killed Pankaj on Avinash's direction. Pankaj had taken money from Avinash by blackmailing him on multiple occasions over his fake certificate,"" he said.

PATNA: The body of Danapur jeweller Mukesh Kumar Gupta was exhumed at Motihari on Saturday night and handed over to his family members for performing last rites according to rituals.

Gupta was kidnapped from Saguna Mor under Danapur police station area in state capital on January 10. The kidnappers had strangled him and buried his body on the banks of river Sikrahna at Chiraiyyan in East Champaran district.

Police had preserved his body for 72 hours after conducting postmortem. The body was identified after police in Patna arrested Ramashish Kumar alias Ashish Yadav, Aman Kumar and Rajesh Kumar on January 16 and came to know that Gupta was murdered within hours of his kidnapping.

Ramashish had mortgaged some jewellery at Mukesh's shop. He was trying to get them back by paying money but Mukesh had asked him to pay more leading to the murder conspiracy.

Chiraiyyan police station SHO (incharge) Hulas Rai said police had received information about the body at around 10am on January 11. ""Neither any cellphone nor purse was recovered from the body. There was ligature mark around neck giving rise to suspicion that the person was strangled by rope or something like that,"" he said.

Rai said the body was exhumed after seeking permission from Sikrahna subdivisional officer (SDO). ""The circle officer was deployed as magistrate for the entire process,"" he said.

The SHO said Mukesh's family members on Saturday submitted a petition in the Sikrahna ACJM court, which asked the SDO to take necessary decision. He said the postmortem report was still awaited.

Meanwhile, Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said one of the kidnappers was still evading arrest. ""He had driven the SUV to Motihari from Patna for dumping the body,"" he said.

Over 1.20 lakh voters are expected to vote in the elections, which are scheduled to be held on January 22.On the last day of campaigning on Sunday, contesting candidates went all out to woo voters in the BMC limits.

While there is a mechanism to collect garbage from every house, heaps of construction debris lying on the roadsides and empty plots goes unnoticed by the municipal corporation,” said Rahul Adwant, a resident who has been living in Boduppal for the last eight years.Many have also complained over encroachment of land, public parks and the Boduppal Cheruvu, which members of various political parties have been promising to beautify for the past many years.“There are many public parks which have been encroached upon. There is absolutely no lung space in the Boduppal area.

GURUGRAM: The staggered transition to a fully automated highway toll collection system has turned into a cause of worry for those working the lanes and seeing its implementation through on the ground. The inevitable fallout, they fear, is a slow phasing out of their role.Jawan Singh had dropped out of school when he was in class VIII. ""I had to work and support my family. But I am too old for casual labour now. I don't have enough farmland. My son was laid off two years ago and has been struggling to get another job. I can't afford to lose mine,"" said the 45-year-old toll operator from Rewari.Jawan's fears are founded on what at this point is conjecture but, he is certain, has to be the next logical step of the move. With FASTag , vehicles won't have to pay highway tolls in cash - the intent being faster, easier travel. There have been three deferrals to a complete switch till now, marked by longer tailbacks and shortening tempers. Management has been messy and the onus of enforcement, in most cases, has come down to toll operators and helpers. At Kherki Daula alone, 200 lane operators and helpers work in three shifts every day to manage vehicle flow through the toll plaza's 25 lanes. And end up doing more than what their job requires.Last year, Soni Kumari (22) was physically assaulted, twice, just for asking motorists to pay the Rs 65 toll. Since FASTag was rolled out, Soni said, her job has turned twice as demanding. ""People have turned even more aggressive. It is a lot of stress and humiliation,"" she said, looking up from her computer screen in the cramped counter, when an SUV stopped at the toll gate. There wasn't enough balance in the vehicle's FASTag account. Soni told the driver his vehicle had been blacklisted and he responded with a string of abuses. It took three lane operators, a marshal and a policeman to calm him down.But leaving is not an option. ""This job is my best shot at funding my education. If I can complete postgraduation, maybe I can get a government job. Otherwise, I will have to give up my studies,"" Soni said.Most toll operators share Soni's background - with limited qualifications or skills and very little flexibility of choices. ""If I don't have a job, my family will marry me off. As long as I am financially independent, I can keep doing what I need to. I have a year to go before I finish my graduation. If I can keep my job until then, I can at least take tuitions or teach somewhere,"" said Roshni, a 20-year-old toll operator.Till now, there has been no official statement about what awaits those who work at toll plazas once they are automated, whatever the time it takes. And this lack of clarity has been disconcerting for many. But concessionaires of Kherki Daula, MCEPL and Skylark, said they would not let their employees go even if their roles turned redundant.""There may be some restructuring and people could be accommodated in other roles. But first, it will take years for full automation, if at all. As of now, it is just a theory that lanes will be unmanned ... Helpers, especially, will definitely be needed - for lifting boom barriers, for using the handheld tag readers,"" a senior MCEPL official said. NHAI, too, said toll operation without human intervention is a long way off. ""I am sure the (road transport and highways) ministry will come up with a solution if a fully automatic system is introduced. But instead of cutting jobs, it will create new kinds of jobs,"" an NHAI official said.And what would that entail? ""Desk work. There is a lot of data that will be generated. We will need data operators, people to manage the records,"" the MCEPL official said. But this would need major reskilling. Something not every employee may be up to. ""There is a limit to how much restructuring can be done,"" a Skylark employee said. The concern is borne out by Jawan: ""I don't even know how to use a smartphone. How could I possibly become a data operator at this age?""",gurgaon,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73418775,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-124957,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/will-fastag-switch-cost-us-our-jobs-ask-wary-toll-staff/articleshow/73397708.cms

Ludhiana: The Council of Engineers, a body comprising techies from Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, has filed a complaint with the chairperson of National Green Tribunal (NGT), the chief secretary of Punjab and the additional chief secretary of the state’s local government department against officials of the Ludhiana MC for covering areas around trees with concrete and paver blocks.

The council has described concretisation around trees as an “act of gross negligence” and said it would cause severe damage to the trees in future. COE president Kapil Arora said the city’s civic body had been continuously covering areas around trees with cement and interlocking tiles (paver blocks) without consulting horticulturists and experts.

Both sides of roads are being covered like this, he said. He added that practice stopping rainwater from seeping into earth and also causing the decay of such trees.

He said trees were at the receiving end of this practice in Sarabha Nagar, B R S Nagar, Kitchlu Nagar, Tagore Nagar and many more areas. “Such an act by the MC is not only a wastage of public money, but will also affect environment,” said Arora.

COE member Mohit Jain said roots of trees absorbed water, carbon dioxide and other nutrients. “Laying of concrete over an existing tree can result in its death. It takes decades to grow a tree properly, but instead of planting new trees, the MC seems to be interested in killing even the existing trees,” Jain said.

He said the act showed that the MC had no vision for providing clean air to residents. “If such act of gross negligence is allowed, a large number of trees in Ludhiana will die due to lack of water and nutrients,” he said.

Another member, Sanjay Verma, said the NGT, in 2013, had directed civic bodies in Delhi to leave a metre’s radius around trees. “Keeping this in view, we have requested the chairperson of NGT, and Punjab chief secretary and additional chief secretary (local government) to direct officials of MC to remove the concrete and paver blocks fixed around trunks of trees,” he said. He added the MC should instead use grass pavers/turf pavers.

Ludhiana: Police here arrested the employee of an e-commerce giant on Saturday for allegedly concocting the story of him being robbed of Rs 35,000 when he was returning to his company’s godown on Friday.

The employee had alleged that two men riding a motorcycle had robbed him near Arora Palace on Gill Road on Friday. However, when he was interrogate, the accused caved in to cross-questioning and he also helped the cops recover Rs 27,000 from the amount, said an official.

Arjan Singh (28), a resident of Gurnam Nagar, Jalandhar Bypass, has been arrested and a case registered against him on a complaint by Dharmjit Singh, who is the manager at the godown.

Sub-Inspector Ranjit Singh, who is the investigating officer, said Arjan had alleged that he was robbed in a phone call made to the police control room. Arjan had alleged that he had collected cash from customers, who had purchased goods through the website, and was near Arora Palace on Gill Road, when two men riding a motorcycle intercepted him. He alleged that the accused asked him to give them the money. When he refused, the men beat him up and snatched the bag containing the case, he alleged.

The official said they scanned footage of security cameras around the crime scene, but found nothing suspicious. The cop added that they also asked shopkeepers near the crime scene, but they said they did not find anything suspicious. As police started doubting the complainant’s story, police questioned Arjan. During interrogation, Arjan confessed to concocting the story, said the cop.

Arjan has told the police that he owed a loan to a money lender and that was why he decided to fake the robbery. A case under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered against the accused at Shimlapuri police station.

PSPCR director Rajinder Singh said, “We will take suo moto cognisance of it. They have been summoned under Section 13 of CPCR (Commission for Protection of Child Rights) Act 2005. We have instructed the school and education department and investigation officers of the Commissionerate of Ludhiana to inquire into the matter and take action. Other steps too will be taken once we get a clear picture, and produce the action taken report on January 30.” Deputy director Rajwinder Gill said, “We have also told district child protection officer Rashmi to visit the school as well as meet the student and report on this at the earliest.”

The ten-year-old was brutally beaten up by the teacher of Government Primary School, Dhandhari Kalan, with a wooden stick on Friday. The student refused to go to school on Saturday morning. His mother Kavita got to know he was beaten mercilessly on Friday, as he — along with his other friends — were making a nuisance in the class, and when the teacher questioned them who was making noises, one of his friends named him. The teacher later beat him with a wooden stick for five minutes continuously. He had severe bruises on his left arm, right leg, and forehead. When we went to complain on Saturday, three more parents were present with the same complaint.

Kavita said, “My son narrated the whole incident. He refused to go to school on Saturday. We first approached the school, but the teacher was not present, and then we approached Kanganwal police chowki. They told us to get our son’s medical check-up done, and so we got it done from Sahnewal Civil Hospital as recommended by police officials. He was sobbing and said he would not go to school as long as the teacher was present. This is not the first incident, as he has been beaten up brutally a month ago by the same teacher. Now, I don’t want her to be suspended, but she should be transferred from this school to some other school.”

The boy, whose father is a security guard in a private firm, was studying in the same school for the past four years. Kanganwal police station ASI Dharminder Singh said, “They have been called on Monday in this matter, as the teacher was busy with TET (Teacher Eligibility Test) duties.”

Ludhiana: Punjabi poet Gurbhajan Gill’s ghazal book titled Mann Pardesi was released by SS Johl, economist and chancellor, Central University of Punjab, during a function held at Punjabi Bhawan. On this occasion, Punjabi Sahit Akademi president Ravinder Bhathal, senior vice-president Surinder Kailey, general secretary Surjit Singh, and former president Sukhdev Singh Sirsa were also present.

Speaking on the occasion, Gurbhajan Gill informed that his first book of ghazals titled Har Dhukhda Pind Mera Hai was published in 1985, after which he had penned books titled Do Harf Raseedi, Mann De Boohe Baarian, Mor Pankh, Tareyan De Naal Gallan Kardeyan, Gulnaar, Mirgawali and Raavi. He informed that Mann Pardesi is his ninth collection of ghazals, and 16th book in total.

This book has been published by Chetna Parkashan. SS Johl said Gill was capable of presenting complex topics of life in a simpler language, as his writings consist of language of our motherland. He said that Gill was not only an excellent poet, but also a far-sighted Punjabi, who was concerned about his motherland. Ravinder Bhathal said Gill had been promoting Punjabi language and culture for the past several decades.

He informed that Gill started his career as a professor of Punjabi language in 1976, and from 1983 to 2013, he served Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) Ludhiana as editor (Punjabi). Gill also remained the president of Punjabi Sahit Akademi from 2010 to 2014, as well as a senior office-bearer of Mohan Singh Memorial Foundation from 1978 to 2014.

457,['20/01/2020'],SAD leaders accuse Taksalis of joining hands with Congress,"This story is from January 20, 2020

CHANDIGARH: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Sunday accused “fake Taksalis” of joining hands with the Congress and their radical sympathisers in a desperate attempt to weaken Akali and Sikh religious institutions.

In a joint statement, Rajya Sabha members Balwinder Singh Bhunder and Naresh Gujral and leaders Prem Singh Chandumajra, Tota Singh and Maheshinder Singh Grewal said a “bunch of opportunists who were dancing to the tune of the Congress” by betraying Akali values could not challenge the leadership of party president Sukhbir Singh Badal “who had been democratically elected by 47 lakh strong members of the Akali Dal”.

Akali leader accused Taksalis of insulted the core Akali ideology by “sharing the stage with the Congress during an event in Delhi”. “The cat is out of the bag. Now, it is clear that all these fake Taksalis have become unofficial members of the Congress,” they alleged.

Chandumajra and Tota asked all Taksalis to first clear the air about their own conduct before pointing fingers at the SAD President. They said Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa’s own track record was such that he did not even contemplate resigning as secretary general when he lost the assembly election during an Akali wave in 1997. They said in direct contrast the SAD had performed splendidly in the past by winning back to back elections and forming a government for 15 out of the last 20 years.

CHANDIGARH: Punjab Unaided Colleges Association (Puca) has urged the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) for relaxing the norms of filling seats in technical institutes in the state.

A Puca delegation met professor M P Poonia, vice-chairman of AICTE, and requested reform in the approval process handbook 2020. Puca president Anshu Kataria said reforms are must for saving the dying technical education institutes and self-financed colleges.

On this, Poonia assured that without compromising the quality of AICTE, changes will be brought.

Kataria, who is also the chairman of Chandigarh-based Aryans Group of Colleges, said AICTE norms should be applicable on the basis of seats filled instead of total seats sanctioned by it.

He added that to get the approval, huge infrastructure including land, buildings, equipment and machinery, furniture and fixture is required, but it all goes to waste when the seats are not filled.

Around 95% of colleges providing technical education are private. Puca senior vice-president Amit Sharma said there is 95% contribution of private institutions in providing technical education and in a way, these institutions are creating employment opportunities. AICTE can revive the dying educational institutions.

Puca general secretary Gurpreet Singh said AICTE should come up with new policies and norms so that surplus resources could be utilised. But these days, unaided colleges are facing financial crunch and should be bailed out.

The winter sports activities were organised by the International Ski Federation in Solang valley on Sunday

MANALI: With an aim to encourage snow sports among children and conserving the environment, the 9th World Snow Day was organised in Solang valley here on Sunday.

Children and youths in large numbers thronged the slopes to enjoy skiing and snowboarding for the whole day. They were given free lessons in skiing. Tourists too tried their hands on the sport. On the call of the International Ski Federation (FIS), the night edition of World Snow Day saw 363 events and sports action taking place in 45 countries on the day.

Ski and Snowboard India secretary general Roopu Negi said the occasion was celebrated at Solang in the presence of a an enthusiastic crowd under the aegis of Indian Olympic Association secretary general Rajeev Mehta. “We are encouraging children and their families to come and enjoy snow. India is performing well in winter sports. The world has now recognised our potential. Though we have not achieved much at international events but we are confident to get recognition among the top athletes of the world soon. Keeping in view that children are the future, snow day celebrations were aimed at encouraging them to show interest in winter sports,” he said.

461,['20/01/2020'],Plan for higher water tariff key to Buddha Nullah rejuvenation,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Moving forward, the metered tariff will be vital to implementing the plan for rejuvenating Buddha Nullah.

LUDHIANA: An MC committee comprising councillors and government officials will be meeting this week to decide on a proposal which seeks to introduce metered water and sewerage tariff, and do away with the previous flat rates, in the city.

Moving forward, the metered tariff will be vital to implementing the plan for rejuvenating Buddha Nullah. This is because the higher revenue generated from the new rates will be used to maintain sewage treatment plants (STPs) which will be set up for treating waste water before it is discharged into the highly polluted drain.

The committee has been formed as when the proposal was listed as an agenda before the MC general house, councillors had deferred the item as they felt the new tariff charges would burden residents. However, as the water tariff is essential to rejuvenation of Buddha Nullah and the plan to implement canal-based water supply in the city, the mayor has formed the committee to give suggestions on the tariff plan.

For Buddha Nullah’s rejuvenation plan, the city body will require Rs 110 crore for mantenance of STPs which will be set up for treating water which is discharged into the train. The MC, which generates just about Rs 35 crore from water and sewerage charges, is hoping to generate more revenue from these charges and use it, even if partly, for maintaining the STPs.

The committee comprises senior deputy mayor Sham Sunder Malhotra, Congress councillors Mamta Ashu, Ashwani Sharma, Jai Parkash, Kuldeep Singh and Gagandeep Singh , SAD councillor Harbhajan Dang, BJP councillors Sunita Rani and Om Parkash Ratra, MC operation and maintenance cell superintending engineer Rajinder Singh, and DCFA Ravinder Walia.

Under the old tariff plan, houses built in an area of up to 125 square yards were exempted from paying water and sewerage bill. Houses which qualify for the exemption will, according to the proposal, be reduced to those which are built in an area of up to 50 square yards.

Though the charges suggested in the proposal are nominal, councillors said in the MC house’s meeting on December 31, 2019, that they were too high and it was decided that the committee would be formed to reach a conclusion. Parkash said the new tariff plan was also vital to implementing canal-based water supply as the new rates would help in implementing the plan. “Groundwater is depleting, so surface water is the need of the hour,” he said.

He said he was going to push for the implementation of the new charges on houses which are in an area of more than 50 square yards. Dang, who is also a member of the commitee, said he was going to push for higher charges for houses which measure more than 125 square yards and ensuring that commercial users pay up. ""We should not be going after the poor for the money. Our government had given exemption to households up to 125 square yards from water and sewerage charges. Only after the meeting will I be able to comment on whether we will support the policy or oppose it,” he said.

Advocate in the Supreme Court Monica Arora addresses the gathering

LUDHIANA: The Rashtriya Vichar Manch organised a rally in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act at Dana Mandi near Jalandhar bypass on Sunday. The rally was organized with an aim to clearing the doubts of general public regarding this Act. The speakers addressed the gathering and asked them to be aware about this act and it had nothing to do with Indian citizens. The Act has been made to give citizenship to non-Muslim refugees who had come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014.

Advocate in the Supreme Court Monica Arora, who participated in the rally, said, “Indian citizens need not to worry about it as it will grant citizenship to refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.” She further said, “India has always given shelter to people who have faced atrocities in the name of religion in other countries and there are certain communities which exist in India which were never given recognition in their own countries.

She said this Act was framed in 1951 and this law was supported by Dr Rajinder Prasad, Jawahar Lal Nehru and B R Ambedkar, while saying that India will give shelter to those non-Muslims who are being treated brutally for changing their religion and they are not getting justice.

Even at the time of Partition Mahatma Gandhi had said the Indian government would provide food and employment to those Hindus and Sikhs who do not want to live in Pakistan. She said but there were some people who did not want to know about the Indian Constitution and were opposing this Act through student unions and minorities.

Other speakers said in these three Muslim countries non-Muslim females were not at all secure as they were being abducted and kidnapped for getting married forcefully. A recent incident of Nankana Sahib is an example. In these countries nobody can celebrate festivals, get employment and participate in social activities freely. The states are not doing right by opposing this Act.

LUDHIANA: If you are planning to make an ATM withdrawal late in the night, be scared and be cautious. A Times of India reality check of nine ATM kiosks in the city on Saturday night revealed that eight of them did not have a security guard.

This is the case even though there have been instances where thieves have decamped with entire ATMs in the city. During the reality check, only one ATM, in Agar Nagar, was found having a guard. Moreover, there were no police teams found in areas around the ATMs either.

Most recently, on November 2, 2019, an entire automated teller machine (ATM) containing Rs 23 Lakh was stolen. The accused first broke open the shutter using gas cutter, then vandalised CCTV cameras, and later uprooted the ATM. Though police arrested three men in connection with the theft on November 13, they are yet to recover the money which was lost.;

Similarly, on December 23, 2019, thieves broke into the Green Field branch of Punjab & Sindh Bank. However, as they could not make their way to the safe, they could not take away in case.

There have been several other attempts made to steal ATMs.

The TOI team after 10pm visited an SBI ATM kiosk on Ferozepur Road near Ansal Plaza, Orient Bank’s ATM in BRS Nagar, CSB Bank’s ATM near Hero Bakery Chowk, Punjab National Bank ATM in Kochar Market, Indusland Bank ATM in Shastri Nagar, Bandhan Bank’s ATM in Feroze Gandhi Market, and IDBI Bank’s ATM in Feroze Gandhi market, but found no security guard.

On December 17, 2019, an attempt was made to decamp with Axis Bank’s ATM on Ferozepur Road, opposite Verka Milk Plant. When TOI visited the spot, it found the shutter of the ATM kiosk locked, but there was no security guard there.

A security guard was found at ICICI Bank’s ATM on Ferozepur Road, near Agar Nagar. The guard said he stayed there from 10pm to 6am. Ludhiana commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal said they would hold a meeting with banks to ensure security arrangements, especially at night.

On October 23, a group of miscreants had tried to break open an ATM of Axis Bank in Haibowal, but could not. A similar failed attempt to break open an ATM had taken place at Bank of India’s branch at PAU on October 30.

The account holder gets 8.4% interest (from October 2019 onwards) on his or her money deposited, which is compounded annually. The money deposited in the account is free from income tax under Section 80-C. An account-holder has to deposit money in this account for 14 years from the date of opening of the account in which he/she gets the interest rate as prescribed by the Government of India from time to time.

Karnal: The relaxation given by the Union government to select toll plazas to have 25% hybrid lanes to allow vehicles both with and without FASTags has led to long queues at Bastara toll plaza in Karnal district.

Even as the deadline for using the radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to make payments at toll plazas on highways has already been extended thrice, around 45% vehicles are still crossing every day without FASTag, say officials at Bastara toll plaza in Karnal district.

A long tailback of vehicles was seen on either side of the toll plaza on Friday. The commuters in vehicles without FASTag could use on cash lanes. They found themselves stuck in long jams and had to wait for 15-20 minutes for their turn. Some of them were also seen trying to enter the lanes reserved for vehicles with FASTag, which caused chaos at the toll plaza, affecting the traffic movement. Arguments between commuters and the toll plaza personnel were also witnessed.

Toll plaza staff claimed that on an average 10 vehicles with FASTag smoothly cross every minute, which was a far cry from the tike taken in cash lanes. Manager of Bastara toll plaza Manish Kumar said there were 24 lanes at the site out of which 25% (or three each each on both sides) were converted into hybrid lanes. “As of now, around 55% of vehicles have been crossing the toll plaza with FASTag. To avoid inconvenience in the cash lane, the commuters should purchase the fastags at the earliest,” he said. He said the tag was available at all toll plazas along with various banks. “It is available on e-commerce sites as well,” he said.

Manohar Lal Khattar receiving a floral welcome by Anil Vij (right) in Ambala on Sunday

CHANDIGARH: Despite their ongoing tussle, Haryana home minister Anil Vij on Sunday played host to CM Manohar Lal Khattar, during the latter’s transit halt at the Ambala cantonment. Vij received Khattar a day after skipping the meetings of his own departments — home, health and medical education — chaired by the CM at his residence on Saturday.

According to information, while on his way to New Delhi, Khattar, accompanied by Himachal CM Jai Ram Thakur, had a transit halt at the Ambala Cantonment Air Force station. Vij received both the CMs and stayed with them till the arrival of an aircraft for two leaders.

“He is my CM and, under protocol, it is my duty to receive him. He was here for few minutes and flew towards Delhi after boarding the flight,” Vij said afterwards.

He added, “We never had any issue with each other. My fight is against those corrupt officers who are using the CM as their shield. This will continue till it reaches its logical conclusion.”

Vij and Khattar have been at loggerheads over the control of Haryana Police’s crime investigation department (CID).

On Saturday, Khattar took a meeting of the major portfolios headed by Vij. What’s more, Khattar even put the recruitment process for the appointment of doctors in the health department on hold, while reviewing the functioning of police department as well CID wing of the police.

Vij had skipped the meeting of the officers, chaired by Khattar at his residence. The health minister confirmed that he had intimation about the meeting.

“My Saturdays are kept aside for the people from across the state, except Ambala, who wish to meet me in person at my residence. Since I was busy with them, I could not make it to the meeting. Were the people only from Ambala were to come, I would have postponed that and gone to Chandigarh,” said Vij.

Referring to the decision halting recruitment of doctors, Vij said, “The CM can take a decision on any issue. It was CMO only which had brought the recruitment of doctors out of the purview of HPSC. However, we do need doctors.”

Ludhiana: As many as four long-route trains heading towards to Kolkata and Uttar Pradesh were cancelled by the railway authorities in the wake of dense fog on the Northern Railway route during the early morning hours on Sunday. Apart from that, almost every train arrived with a minimum delay of five to six hours. Even premium trains coming from the national capital towards Amritsar witnessed a delay of at least one hour, as Shatabdi Express arrived at 1.20pm, instead of 12noon.

Maximum delay was witnessed by Lohit Express from Guwahati to Jammu Tawi, as it arrived seven hours late at 2.30pm, instead of 7.30am. Station superintendent Ashok Salaria claimed that following a dense blanket of fog early in the morning and late in the evening on the Northern Railway route, some long-route trains were cancelled by the railway authorities.

Inquiry officials at the station claimed that Shan-e-Punjab Express from Amritsar to New Delhi also reached Ludhiana late by one hour, twenty minutes at 1.45pm, instead of 12.25pm. Tata Muri Express from Tata Nagar to Jammu Tawi arrived late by about five-and-a-half hours at 10.32pm, instead of 5.05am. Even Malwa Express from Indore to Jammu Tawi, along with Shaheed Express saw a delay of around three hours.

Passengers seemed frustrated waiting for their trains on Sunday, as chilly weather made them restless. Many of them cried foul over the cancellation of Kolkata-bound trains, as they had booked their confirmed seats two to three months ago. Passenger Vishal Sharma, who was waiting for Chhatisgarh Express, said, “I had to face the problem of train delay again, as my train was running way behind schedule. I was here to attend a wedding with family members, but now I have to go back to the bus stand and use other modes of transport.”

Woman passenger Ankita Gehlot, waiting for Kolkata Express, said, “Women and children continued to struggle to catch trains in such unpleasant weather, but authorities have turned a blind eye to their suffering, as railway authorities have not increased the strength of the waiting rooms, and we have to sit on the floor in the case of delay of trains.”

475,['20/01/2020'],CICU holds workshop on lean manufacturing,"This story is from January 20, 2020

Ludhiana: Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) on Sunday organised a workshop on lean manufacturing processes for city businessmen. The programme was organised at the Focal Point office of the association, where a large number of businessmen and representatives of various industries took part.

CICU president Upkar Singh Ahuja said, “Time and time again we have been organising seminars and workshops for the benefit and upgradation of skills of industry and trade sectors, as the role of top management has become extremely critical nowadays. As industry today is surrounded by a lot of challenges like shrinking profit margins, late deliveries, sub-standard quality of products, improvement of systems, and skill trainings of employees, it is necessary to increase profit margins by reducing manufacturing costs and improving product quality and productivity to remain competitive in the market. The workshop was a huge success, as more than 60 businessmen, top-level executives of reputed companies, and other staff attended this workshop.”

During Sunday’s programme, an interactive session too was conducted, which was presided over by trainer Rajesh Singh Solanki. He elaborated on the concepts of Lean Manufacturing, Kaizen, Kanban, Poka Yoke, and Problem Solving. He also presented case studies of the successful implementation of lean manufacturing practices in small and micro enterprises, and government initiatives to facilitate related benefits to the industry.

Meanwhile, CICU has also raised its voice against the problem of notices being sent by the office of zila parishad to some businessmen to pay new taxes. Giving more information, Ahuja said, “Recently, many industries received notices to pay charges for use of road by the office of zila parishad. This is the first time zila parishad has issued notices to industrial units, and it is really very shocking, as already industry has to obtain 23 clearances from different departments, and now to add to our pain, zila parishad too has jumped in and imposed a new kind of tax on us. But we will not tolerate these kind of atrocities, and we will take up this matter with the chief minister’s office, as the new tax is totally uncalled for.”

476,['20/01/2020'],"Women power takes on CAA, NRC","This story is from January 20, 2020

Ludhiana: Women from various communities, mostly Muslims, took out a rally to voice their anger against the ‘black law’ of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and NRC here on Sunday. The protest rally started from Brown road, passed through Subhani Building area and Shahpur road before culminating at the Jama Masjid in Field Gunj. At the Jama Masjid, the stage was managed by Naib Shahi Imam Maualana Usman Ludhianvi. The protesters were holding placards against the CAA and NRC while some had ‘Hindu Muslim Sikh Isai, Aapas Main Hain Bhai Bhai, written on it.

Giving details, Maualana Usman Ludhianvi said student leader of Punjab University Kanupriya, Navdeep Kaur of a Sikh religious channel, apart from thousands of members from Hindu, Sikh, Christian communities participated in the protest rally. He added that women protesters after holding the rally presented a blood written resolution to Shahi Imam Punjab Maulana Habib-ur-Rehman Saani Ludhianvi.

The Shahi Imam said in the written resolution that the women protesters had vouched that they would strongly oppose the ‘black law’, made as part of a conspiracy to break the Constitution, till the last drop of their blood. He added that in the resolution women protesters have written that they were together in the freedom struggle and no one would be able to break the brotherhood, which reflects unity in diversity.

The protesters wrote that refugees were their brothers but not on the basis of religion but on the basis of humanity and ‘Bhartiyata’. They alleged that the government under the garb of refugees was trying to murder democracy but they would not allow it to do so.

Student leader Kanpuriya while addressing the protesters alleged that ‘divisive’ forces were trying to break communal harmony and integrity of the country but daughters, sisters and mothers of the country would not allow such ‘agenda’ of the Modi government to succeed. She added that those promising ‘roti, kapda and makaan’ were now asking for proof of citizenship from the people of the country.

Maulana Habib-ur-Rehman Saani Ludhianvi claimed that Modi government was avoiding the questions of daughters of India. He added that it was unfortunate that despite being in power, the Union government had to organise rallies in favour of law made by it and was hesitating in directly talking to people.

On this occasion, Rehnuma Khatoon recited a Nazm (verses) ‘hum dekhenge’ of Faiz Ahmed Faiz whereas Halima Ansari and Gul Afshan recited the poem ‘yeh desh hamara hai’. A protester, Nasreen Sultana, who addressed the gathering in Punjabi took potshots at the ‘wrong’ policies of the central government.

However, as it came out in the morning and shined throughout the day, it made our Sunday special. I enjoyed sleeping under it on the roof after a delicious lunch, and it felt like heaven,” said Manoj Kumar, a businessman from Chandigarh Road.
