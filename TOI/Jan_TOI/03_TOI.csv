1,['3/01/2020'],"Darshana Rajendran: In the past decade, it has become easier for actors to get opportunities","It’s been six years since Darshana Rajendran debuted as a film actor. In this period, she has played quite a few memorable characters, especially in films like Virus and Mayaanadhi. But the best is yet to come for her as she has been cast as the lead in the upcoming films Hridayam by Vineeth Sreenivasan and the anthology film Pennum Cherukkanum by Aashiq Abu. She is also part of Rajeev Ravi’s Thuramukham. Darshana tells us what it has been like to work in an industry, in which the former finance professional ended up by chance.Yes. There is Pennum Cherukkanum and Thuramukham, which I am done shooting for. And then there is Hridayam that is set to begin soon. All of these are very exciting projects.It does feel like home for me. From the moment I got a call from him about this film, I have been waiting for the shoot to begin. I think there is something amazing with work that comes out of a very comfortable, happy environment. Aashiq Abu is a master at that.You are working again with actor Roshan Mathew, who has now debuted in Bollywood, through Pennum Cherukkanum. Please tell us about the experience.Although A Very Normal Family, a play which he directed was our first work together, we have both been very closely associated with each other in the theatre space. We have also started working on our next play. We worked on Koode, but we didn’t have many scenes together. So Pennum Cherukkanum felt new. I have a huge list of directors, actors and artistes I want to work with in films... I think all actors do. With Pennum Cherukkanum, I got to tick Roshan off that list. He is a very intelligent, giving actor and there is a lot to learn from him. It was great working with him and I hope we get to do more work together.I come from theatre where sometimes I am on stage for only a five-minute scene and otherwise throughout the play. How big my part has hardly mattered. With films as well, it has not been so much about screen time, as it is about what I am doing with that time. Having said that, a lot of writing in films is hero-heroine centred and it is not very often that we come by good character roles. So, in a space like that, it does feel great to be considered for more prominent roles. It is also great to be part of an industry that does not have set rules when it comes to how the lead characters should look.She did. And I was very happy to hear that. But of course, it is not on the cards. She was just answering a hypothetical question (laughs) It will be great if it happens though.I did not see it coming when I was working in finance. But, finding theatre really did change my life. It was very liberating to find something that I enjoyed so much. It started as a hobby that I did alongside my job. But slowly I wanted to spend more and more time with it. Deciding to quit my job was the most difficult decision for sure, but one that I am very glad I took. It has been far from easy. There is no end of the month salary, no routine, no certainty. It was very different from the life I lived before and took some time getting used to. But now it is part of the deal. One stage bow or one good day at shoot seems to make up for the ‘not so nice’ parts of the job.Yes. I went in for a musical audition thinking I could sing and ended up doing a lot more than just singing. That is how theatre happened. I love singing, but to be honest I do not think of myself as a singer. It has always been quite a personal thing for me until Bawra Mann of Mayaanadhi happened. I am still scared to put out more of my work. But I would love to. I did explore the space a little more and there have been some exciting developments. I hope to do a lot more but slowly.It has been difficult for sure but honestly I think actors have it a lot easier than before. There is a lot more access now. Most of the films hold auditions today. I am able to reach the directors I would like to work with. That is a great thing for an actor. Even getting to audition for films like Thuramukham is so fulfilling.Having said that, it has been far from easy to figure out this world on my own. Whether it is going for an audition or picking a particular film or deciding to do a particular character or just agreeing on my payment, I think I am still doing some trial and error and learning along the way.This is another area of interest. I absolutely love working with children. I do storytelling sessions for children. Sometimes I work with childrens’ publications and take their stories to kids. With all this technology and easy access, I feel like we are slowly losing the habit of telling stories to children. But there is some magic that storytelling can create for them and I am very happy that I get to do that. Apart from storytelling, I also conduct theatre workshops for children along with my sister Bhavana. We recently started ‘Theatre with B and D’ to introduce children to theatre and we have done workshops in Bangalore and Kochi.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73069284,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-202788/73069284.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/darshana-rajendran-in-the-past-decade-it-has-become-easier-for-actors-to-get-opportunities/articleshow/73069267.cms
2,['3/01/2020'],"My First Shot: Your first film always sets the tone for your career, says Andrea","I initially did not want to be an actor because I wanted to pursue music. So, I was saying no to all the film offers that were coming my way, including Pachaikili Muthucharam. But one of Gautham Menon’s assistants knew me from my theatre days.She said, ‘Listen, I know you are going to study music. But do this for pocket money and go’. So, I said OK. But I had no idea what I was getting into. I landed up on the set to shoot. This makeup artiste applied makeup on my face and even at that point, I did not know what was going on. Luckily, I had a good DOP (cinematographer), Mr Aravind Krishna. My first shot for Pachaikili Muthucharam was the opening shot of the song, Un Sirippinil, where my character stands at the doorway. So, I gave my first shot and Mr AK was like, ‘Come here, who put this makeup on your face? Go wash your face’ (laughs). He did not want any makeup on me. So I washed my face and gave the shot again. I did not wear any makeup for the entire film! I was, like, 21 at the time. Much later, Gautham told me that a lot of female fans really liked how I was looking real on screen in that film. I guess I have to thank Mr Aravind Krishna for that. Your first film always sets the tone and foundation for your career. I was very lucky that way to have worked with such wonderful people.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73070734,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-470036/73070734.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/my-first-shot-your-first-film-always-sets-the-tone-for-your-career-says-andrea/articleshow/73070734.cms
3,['3/01/2020'],Nothing can stop people from going to movie halls; that’s the magic of cinema,"It’s been more than a month since ace lensman-turned-filmmaker PC Sreeram was honoured with the Legend of Indian Cinema award at the International Film Festival of India, Goa. The veteran cinematographer wrote, “miles to go to capture many dreams”, expressing his gratitude on social media. “I really meant it. Awards mean a lot, but recognitions shouldn’t disturb one’s workflow,” he begins. In a free-wheeling chat with us, Sreeram talks about the unexpected honour, his plans to get into film direction, a dream that he has been nurturing for quite some time, the growth of south film industry in the recent years, and the dismal response to some of his recent films at the Box Office...I was told about the award by the festival director when I was shooting in Hyderabad. It was completely unexpected and initially, I didn’t understand what it was for. Later, they explained it to me and I was happy to receive it. For me, this is one more award — to work hard for more films.I have always felt that there are some directors who know how to get the best out of me. That’s the reason why I tend to team up with some people repeatedly. Moreover, you have that comfort level with a few people. In fact, there is no point in working on a project together without having a complementing vibe. The project with Balki was supposed to start earlier, but he became busy with Mission Mangal’s script and it took him more time than expected to complete it.The shooting of Super Deluxe had started long ago, and it got affected by demonetisation, because of which the production was halted for some time. So, my dates clashed with Padman. I had watched the movie (Super Deluxe) and I liked it, but it deserved more attention from the audiences. I chose not to do Psycho because I had a serious allergic problem and I didn’t know about its intensity initially. I needed a few months’ break, and hence, I asked Mysskin to go ahead with my assistant. I also missed taking up Vikram Kumar’s Telugu movie with Nani.I expected Naa Nuvve to be at least an above-average grosser at the box office, but it was rejected outrightly. I felt it had its basics right. But sometimes, you can’t gauge the audience’s mindset. I personally enjoyed working on Praana, which had only one character. Speaking of that film, I’m reminded of Parthiban’s Oththa Seruppu. He had done an extraordinary job of holding the audience’s attention.When I was working recently in Hyderabad, I was having a discussion with a few people there. They said, of late, the market for big-ticket Hindi films has gone down in the south. Bollywood had a good market in Karnataka and the Telugu-speaking states. They say that there used to be a festival mood earlier when big Bollywood flicks released there. I watched a much-hyped Hindi film some time ago — it had great VFX work, but lacked a screenplay. What is the point of having good VFX work without an engaging narration? But content-oriented Hindi movies have been performing well here, like Badhaai Ho, Andhadhun, Article 15, and so on.It is more or less similar to what happened with satellite television in the 90s. Many movie halls used to have empty evening and night shows when satellite television became popular. But that didn’t stop people from going to movie halls — that’s the magic of cinema. When I was working on Padman in a remote village in Madhya Pradesh, I came across people who did not have money for their basic needs. But I learnt that two out of the four theatres there had houseful shows. I think OTT content will become monotonous sooner or later. I read somewhere that two such platforms have already withdrawn from India. The problem is, here, when someone comes up with something, 20 other people also jump in and eventually, it loses steam. Also, from what I have seen, I don’t think so many series with grey characters and gory scenes can impress people for a long time. Regional content has got its own strength and the audience will flock to theatres if they are given engaging movies.One movie which impressed me with its screenplay and making was Lokesh’s Kaithi. It had a slickness to it and the element of time was intriguingly worked in the narration. I was amazed to see how it was packaged commercially, with nicely choreographed fights. I would say the film is on par with world cinema. It was after a long time that I got totally engrossed in a film.I will surely direct not one, but many films. I have more frames to capture. I haven’t decided what kind of projects I want to be at the helm of, though.I believe everyone should voice their opinion. I can’t hold back my opinions for sure. I express them loud, but I make sure I don’t hurt anybody. But I will stand by what I express on social media. It’s the biggest weapon we have now to raise our voice.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73070689,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1005510/73070689.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/nothing-can-stop-people-from-going-to-movie-halls-thats-the-magic-of-cinema/articleshow/73070689.cms
4,['3/01/2020'],"Pet-Time Stories: Frankie is everything to me, says Athulya Ravi","When Athulya Ravi lost her first dog, Rosy, in an accident, the actress decided that she would never have pets at home. “Her death affected me deeply. I was young and I could never come to terms with it. I remember crying for days together. I told my parents that we shouldn’t have dogs at home. Of course, we had several dogs in our farm in Coimbatore. I was close to them, but I didn’t get too attached. It’s only after moving to Chennai that I finally decided to have one,” says Athulya, petting her Shih Tzu Frankie , while talking to us...Athulya says that Frankie helps her destress. “When I decided to have pets, I wanted to have a Shih Tzu; I have a special liking towards that breed. I happened to see a video of Frankie when he was a baby. The moment I saw him, I decided to bring him home. He was 34 days old when I got him home. It is a delight to watch him grow,” she says, “He is my alarm clock... he waits patiently for me to wake up in the mornings. If I’m not up and about by 10am, he pushes the door open and tries to wake me up. If I had a late-night shoot, I’d sleep for some more time. So, if I don’t wake up, he usually sleeps next to my bed.” The actress goes on to add, “Our job can be stressful at times, but Frankie keeps me stress-free. The joy he brings to my heart when I see him waiting for me at the door is indescribable. He figures out I’m home the minute he hears the lift door opening. He waits near the door and once he sees me, he jumps on me. And at that instant, I forget all my other worries. Frankie means everything to me. He is like family to all of us. My mother never addresses him as naai; she calls him chellam or kuttyma. My brother jokes about how she calls him naaiye instead!”Athulya says Frankie knows when she’s upset. “When somebody at home is angry or is shouting at me, Frankie plays the role of my defender,” says Athulya, “He barks at them until they stop. We have noticed this a couple of times. Sometimes, my mother and I pretend that we are arguing about something. But he is very intelligent and knows that we are putting up an act. Whenever I am really down, he jumps on me and asks me to pet him. Naturally, it brightens my mood. He is a darling that way.”So, does he recognise her when she appears on television? “When I’m home, and if my face appears on TV, he gets confused. He looks at me and then stares at the television. It’s so funny to watch him then! But yes, he does recognise my voice and responds to me when I am talking to him over the phone. He’s first on my priority list. Like, if I am in a supermarket, I first look out for toys and food for him, and only then shop for myself and others,” says Athulya.Athulya recalls how she and Yashika Aannand decided to get their pets together for a play date. “She came home with her pet, Coco, who is also a Shih Tzu. Frankie and Coco were initially acting shy around each other and didn’t play much. But after a while, they began barking and were speaking in a language only they could understand,” she says with a laugh.Athulya regularly travels to Coimbatore with Frankie. “We take him in our car so that the journey is comfortable for him. He loves long drives. He gets all jumpy when he is in the car. He loves to put his head out of the window and get fresh air. If we close the window, he gets upset. He feels at home in Coimbatore. He walks and runs around our home like he’s the boss. I sometimes leave him behind with my family there because he loves the weather and all the attention that he gets. I travel to Coimbatore again after a few weeks to bring him back to Chennai,” she says.“If you want to have a pet, you need to promise yourself that you will spend ample time with them. Treat them like your family member. If you can’t look after them, don’t have them. It is important to spend time, talk and play with your pet. I regularly walk Frankie in the evenings. If I am busy, I make sure someone else takes him for a walk. I also ensure that I take him to the doctor for regular check-ups. This is something I don’t compromise on as I want to be with him whenever he is sick. We also ensure that we play with him every single day,” says Athulya.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73070862,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-938407/73070862.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/pet-time-stories-frankie-is-everything-to-me-says-athulya-ravi/articleshow/73070862.cms
5,['3/01/2020'],Ishan and Ashika play rock stars in Raymo,"Pavan Wadeyarr’s upcoming movie Raymo, which stars Ishan CV and Ashika Ranganath , is a musical love story. Both the lead actors in the film are featured as musicians, who are part of a band. The team recently shot the concert and tour sequences in South Africa , while plans are afoot to shoot in Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia as well. In the film, Ishan portrays a typical rock star, who plays the double-neck guitar. Stressing on how Ishan took extra classes to learn the guitar , Pavans says, “He has undergone special training to understand the nuances of playing the musical instrument. Double-neck guitars are really tough to learn. One needs to be musically inclined to play them with dexterity. We have specialists from the field coming in and training Ishan for two months. He has worked hard to ensure that he plays it onscreen with confidence.”“Ashika, on the other hand, essays the role of a girl from an orthodox Brahmin family. The storyline focuses on the what happens when two such contrasting characters come together as part of a band,” explains the filmmaker.The movie was shot in South Africa in December. Not many people know that there are many Kannadigas in that country, says Pavan, adding, “The nation is home to more than 20 lakh Indians, so it made all the more sense for us to shoot one of our concert sequences there. The gigs take the band across the globe, and so we’ll be travelling to Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore next.” Madhoo joins the cast…Pavan reveals that Roja-fame actress, Madhoo, will be joining the cast of Raymo soon. “She plays a doctor, which is a pivotal role in the film.

6,['3/01/2020'],The lob is here to stay,"The long bob — better known as the lob — is a hair trend that has caught the attention of women around the globe. While Bollywood actresses have often experimented with the clothes they wear, the same isn’t true when it comes to their hairstyles. However, that seems to have changed with the lob finding a fanbase among the leading ladies in B-Town. Deepika Padukone made a splash when she recently did away with her trademark long locks and instead sported a smart lob at a red carpet do. The same holds true for Kareena Kapoor Khan. Priyanka Chopra Jonas, who has always kept her mane on the shorter side, seems to be having a lot of fun styling her lob in different ways. From soft curls and waves to keeping them poker straight, she has done it all. Anushka Sharma, Bhumi Pednekar Yami Gautam and Parineeti Chopra are among the other actresses, who are currently sporting the lob. On foreign shores, where the trend first caught on, celebs like Gal Gadot, Hailey Baldwin Bieber, Hilary Duff and Millie Bobby Brown have been rocking it. Here’s what makes this hairstyle popular...Women across age groups are opting for the lob. Hair expert Dorris Godambe says, “The lob doesn’t have any limitation when it comes to age; anyone can slay this look. It all depends on a person’s face structure and confidence level.” Hair expert Coleen Khan Affonso adds, “It suits women of all age groups. In fact, I think that those who are 25 years and above can have more fun with it.”Stylists say that this hairstyle is not a short-term trend. “Lob will be around for a long time as it has a youthful appeal,” points out Dorris. Talking about its longevity, Coleen says, “It has a very international vibe to it. The good thing about the lob is that it’s not too short or long. It flatters almost every hair texture and face structure. I see it staying around well into this year.”Coleen says, “I think that it looks better with Western outfits, but you can tie a low bun when you are wearing Indian attire. It’s possible to do that as your hair is longer in the front and goes all the way back. You can add a hairpiece and do a lot more, too. Also, today everything is so fluid; women with the shortest haircuts look stunning in saris. So, there are no hard and fast rules.”Dorris lists Deepika and Anushka as her favourites. “They carry it beautifully and with a lot of confidence,” she says. Coleen, whose vote goes to Deepika, shares, “She has got the height, the face… she has what it takes to take this look to the next level.”“You can do a lot with this particular style. You can put it up, or let it loose, or style it in many other ways. I am glad that our actresses are being more adventurous and doing fun stuff with their hair,” says Coleen. Talking about the versatility of the hairdo, she adds, “You can adjust it, obviously. You can texturise it, or change the parting. You can also add layers to it and make it like a messy lob, or have beach waves, or go very sleek.” Another factor that works in favour of this look is that one doesn't have to visit the parlour too often. “Unlike looks like the pixie cut, you don’t have to go for a trim at short intervals. You can let it grow out, as it doesn’t look awkward or out of shape at any stage,” points out Coleen.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73073976,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-76456/73073976.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/the-lob-is-here-to-stay/articleshow/73073962.cms

‘The cold wave has led to an increase in our sales’

Are you thinking of boosting your winter wear collection by picking up trendy woollens from NCR’s budget-friendly street markets? Then you better buck up as Delhi’s biting cold winter has led to a surge in demand of the winter wear, which are not only chic but also inexpensive. Sellers tell us that stocks are going off the shelves in a jiffy as shoppers are looking to layer up for the winters in style, and are regularly flocking the markets.Walking through the Sarojini Nagar Market, one can hear a hawker yelling,That holds true for NCR shoppers as sellers tell us that the latest winter wear, including wool-knit skirts, faux fur jackets and animal print coats, are going out of stock. “Since the sales this season have been unprecedented, we have run out of the latest trends of winter clothes. For instance, faux fur jackets were a major hit. And one would have to look very hard to find them now as they are sold out at most shops,” says Ansari, a shopkeeper.Anasuya, a shopper, tells us, “Last week, I had selected a wool-knit tweed skirt but did not buy it as I was in a rush. Now, I am regretting my decision as I cannot find that skirt, or even a similar-looking one in the market now.”Another seller at Noida’s Brahmaputra Market says that the time taken to replenish their stock leads to losses. “Latest fashionitemIt takes at least three days for the stock to arrive once we order for it.

After months of are they, aren’t they, KL Rahul seems to be slowly making his relationship with actress Athiya Shetty , official. Those following his feed on Instagram may have noticed his fun post with his ladylove, which also paid tribute to her dad Suniel Shetty ’s film, Hera Pheri.The news might not come as a surprise to those close to the couple, as the two have been friends for almost two years now, and most of them saw it coming, given their compatibility. The duo, along with their friends, had also gone to Thailand to bring in the New Year. Interestingly, in the beginning, many wondered if Rahul was dating Athiya’s friend Akansha Ranjan. It was also believed that she played Cupid and got the two together. Turns out, it’s neither. A friend close to the couple revealed, “Akansha and Rahul are best friends. She didn’t set him up with Athiya.” Talking about Rahul and Athiya’s equation, the source adds, “They have been friends for a long time. Both have a crazy sense of humour and most of their buddies had anticipated their friendship transforming into romance. The two have been dating for a few months now. Given their schedules, they try to spend as much time with each other as possible.”We hear, Athiya’s family — dad Suniel, mom Mana and brother Ahan — are extremely fond of Rahul, and are supportive of her dashing cricketer beau.Their comments on his posts are testament to the rapport they share. In July last year, BT had reported about Athiya and Rahul being in a relationship, but the two had kept mum back then. In fact, the last time (August 19, 2019) we asked Rahul about his relationship status, he told BT, “I have learnt to keep my personal life personal and not make it a thing to talk about. I am committed to cricket right now.” However, he didn’t pretend to be single either. When asked he if was single, he had replied, “I don’t really know.

17,['3/01/2020'],"Reduce, reuse, recycle: Start 2020 with sustainable fashion","From decluttering your wardrobe and being more informed about a brand’s ethical practices to shopping for vintage clothing and donating your unwanted clothes, here are some tips to adopt this lifestyle changeEco-friendly fabric’, ‘slow fashion’, ‘organic’ or ‘sustainable’ – chances are that you came across these words almost every time you read about fashion forecasts and trends for 2020. But if you still aren’t thinking about what will happen to your worn-out tees, denims, handbags or sneakers once you have discarded them, you are far from choosing sustainable fashion as a lifestyle. Following sustainable fashion is mostly about making informed choices, and all it takes to begin is a closer look at your wardrobe. Reduce, reuse and recycle should be your goal for this year, and decluttering your wardrobe is the first step towards that goal. Thinking twice (or even thrice) before buying anything, assessing if you actually need what you want, donating and/or swapping clothes and upcycling are a few simple changes that you can incorporate in your lifestyle to contribute your bit towards sustainability.When was the last time you took a note of the clothes that have been lying around in your wardrobe that you no longer wear? If it has been a while, then assess your wardrobe to see whether you really need anything new the next time you want to buy something or check out the latest sale. A quick tip for those who have piles of clothes to go through – “Sort your wardrobe keeping in mind the ‘most worn’, ‘rarely worn’ and ‘never worn’ clothes. The easiest way to clean your closet is to part ways with ‘never worn’ clothes first. Donate them to NGOs or organisations that recycle clothes,” suggests Sujata Chatterjee, a fashion innovator, who has been promoting sustainable fashion and living. Though it’s easier to believe that “one never has enough clothes to wear”, it’s time to be honest with yourself and tell yourself that you need not buy new clothes for every occasion. “If you are honest with yourself, you will realise that all those dresses that you have been hoarding thinking kabhi toh kaam aayega are actually of no use. Just give them away to those who need them,” says Gurgaon-based architect Kanika Kush, who cleared 70% of her wardrobe in just a few days when she decided to embrace slow fashion last year.Most of you may have heard from your mothers about how they used to exchange clothes within the family on special occasions, rather than buy new outfits every time. Decluttering your closet is important, and once you have done that, be mindful of the fact that you do not accumulate more than what you need. “Every time I have an urge to buy something new, I ask myself, ‘Do I really need it?’ and ‘Do I need it for just one occasion or for multiple times?’. If I feel that I really need something, but just for one occasion, I am happy borrowing it,” says Deepa Choudhary, a Delhi-based entrepreneur, who started looking for sustainable ways in fashion almost three years ago.Before buying something, check out outlets that offer second-hand clothes or resale sites. Do not resort to buying from high street fashion labels as your first choice. This will not just save you money, but also help you say no to fast fashion. “I stopped buying from high street retail outlets a year ago. It was a conscious decision, keeping in mind how much wastage these fast fashion brands promote. One can also research the brands they are buying from, and spend money only on those following ethical practices, or buy from retail outlets when they have offers like swapping old clothes,” says Kritika Batra, a Delhi-based software engineer. Another option can be buying your own fabrics and getting them stitched, she adds.If you don’t like giving away your clothes, look for ways to reuse them. There are several videos online on how to convert your ripped denims into a cool bag, or how to use your old tee even if it’s faded. “Reuse your old clothes, mend them, or convert them into a new attire. Initially, it might sound tedious, but once you start doing it, you will notice how you end up buying less,” says Gurgaon-based entrepreneur Sakshi Arora, adding, “Do not buy as per trends. In fact, it would be wise to copy the style and recreate it from something that you already own.”Do not buy something just because it is cheapLook out for brands where you can exchange your old clothesResearch for brands those follow ethical practicesOpt for organic fabricsMake a list of what you need to buy, and stick to it",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73070642,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-92731/73070642.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/fashion/buzz/reduce-reuse-recycle-start-2020-with-sustainable-fashion/articleshow/73070495.cms

MUMBAI: Maharashtra saw a steep rise in farmer suicides last November — 300 cases that month — the first time in four years. Farmer suicides had crossed 300 cases in a month several times in 2015.The spurt in cases came immediately after unseasonal rains lashed the state from October, destroying almost 70% of kharif crop. The last time the state had touched or crossed 300 farmer suicides in a month was in 2015.Between October and November last year, the number of cases rose 61%, shows the latest revenue department data. The state recorded 186 farmer suicides in October. The cases rose by another 114 in November.The drought-prone belt of Marathwada recorded the highest number of 120 cases in November 2019 while Vidarbha , which usually sees the largest number of farmer suicides, recorded 112 cases.As a result of the rise in cases that month, farmer suicides in the 11-month period between January and November 2019 were higher than those in the same period in 2018. During this period in 2019, the numbers totalled 2,532, up from 2,518 in 2018.The unseasonal rains hit one crore farmers in the state, on par with the population of Sweden. This accounts for two-thirds of the state’s farmers. The bulk of the farmers affected or 44 lakh of the total figure are from Marathwada.The government is also in the process of providing compensation to farmers. So far Rs 6,552 crore has been distributed to those affected, officials say. The Maha Vikas Aghadi government also announced a loan waiver in December 2019. The earlier BJP-led government had declared a loan waiver in 2017 which led to loans worth Rs 18,000 crore being waived for 44 lakh farmers.Activists say beyond loan waivers and compensation, the state needs to make farming more profitable. “The cost of farming inputs and labour is so high that the farmer cannot survive a bad season. This is the main reason for the suicides. Farmers need to be able to earn more through the sale of produce. The economics of farming are tilted against farmers,” says Vidarbha-based activist Vijay Jawandhia.Last year the Marathwada region had a rain deficit in monsoon . Western Maharashtra was lashed by floods in July-August which damaged 4 lakh hectares of crop.

NEW DELHI: Despite Nepal itching to start a dialogue with India on the Kalapani border dispute, the government insisted on Thursday that India’s new political map, released after reorganisation of the J&K state, depicted the country’s borders accurately. It, however, added that the boundary delineation process is still going on.“Our map accurately depicts the sovereign territory of India. The new map has in no manner revised our boundary with Nepal,’’ said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar.This was even as reports emerged in Nepal media on Thursday that Kathmandu had proposed January 15 as a possible date for dialogue between the foreign secretaries on the issue.

MUMBAI: Maharashtra is considering enacting a special Public Security Act on the lines of Chhattisgarh , said state home minister Eknath Shinde on Thursday. Shinde had conveyed a meeting to discuss security issues in Maharashtra’s Naxalite-affected areas.Chhattisgarh’s Special Public Security Act was passed by that state’s assembly in 2005. The law has been called “draconian” by human rights activists and civil society groups as it has provisions under which the police can detain a person for “committing acts that pose an obstacle to the administration of law”.“To tackle Naxalism in the state, we are considering enacting a Public Security Act on the lines of Chhattisgarh. The Chhattisgarh law would be studied. After discussions with CM Uddhav Thackeray, the Public Security Act will be introduced in Maharashtra,” said Shinde.He said the state will set up a special task force on the lines of the border road organisation to complete pending road and bridge works in Gadchiroli and Chandrapur , which are affected by Naxalism. He said the task force will comprise 30% security personnel and 70% engineers. “The state will also draft a policy to give incentives to government employees who work in these areas,” the minister said.Advocate Lara Jesani, member, People’s Union for Civil Liberties, said: “It will only lead to state repression and infringe upon people’s rights. We need to condemn this move and urge the government to take back this decision.”In Video: Maha plans C'garh-like security act to Curb Naxalism",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73076999,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1082119,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/maharashtra-plans-chhattisgarh-like-public-security-act-to-counter-reds/articleshow/73076996.cms

File photo

MUMBAI: In a marriage of the sciences and liberal arts as well as accounting, the Indian Nursing Council (INC)—the umbrella decision-making body for all nursing courses and registered nurses—plans to alter entry norms for this professional programme. It has framed draft rules permitting students from the arts and commerce streams to sign up for the BSc nursing course. Suggestions from experts have been invited on the draft.

The four-year course was till now open only to students who finished Class XII with science. They had to then clear a competitive entrance test. If the draft comes into effect, all Class XII pass-outs with a score of at least 45% would be eligible to appear for the entrance test to join the professional course in colleges across India.

The draft amendment was brought about after a decision was taken to stop the diploma course of GNM (general nursing and midwifery) from 2021. This programme would admit students of all streams, and most graduates after finishing the three-year programme would largely get placed in nursing homes.

“With the closure of the GNM course, the entire nursing profession would have been closed for arts and commerce students. Hence it looks like the council is now permitting these students to enter the BSc course,” said a nursing college principal. A council member, Dr Ramling Mali , said, “This is literally like killing the BSc programme and upgrading the GNM programme.”

As per the draft, the new BSc nursing programme will have 60 additional lecture hours for arts and commerce graduates to bring them on a par with their counterparts who pursued science till Class XII. The All India Government Nurses Federation feels that won’t be enough. In a letter to INC, it has said “relaxing” entry norms would be met with “strong resentment”. “We were expecting revolutionary steps from INC to upgrade our profession. But it has been brought to our notice that INC has prepared a draft to improve/upgrade the nursing profession (GNM courses upgraded to BSc nursing) wherein the draft quotes in its admission criteria that it includes arts/commerce candidates who have passed 10+2 as being eligible for BSc nursing. This is very shocking and an alarming sign in nursing and it will downgrade the profession,” reads the letter.

Also, the duration for teaching anatomy & physiology has been reduced in the new draft curriculum. That too has not gone down well with college heads, who said these subjects are essential to the nursing profession.

NEW DELHI: A day after the defence ministry had rejected Bengal’s tableau proposal for the Republic Day parade, it further fuelled a political row by turning down Maharashtra ’s presentations on Thursday.Three opposition parties — NCP, Shiv Sena and Trinamool — have accused the Centre of prejudice even as the defence ministry said in a statement that “only a limited number of tableaux can be shortlisted” for the parade keeping in mind the overall duration of the function.The proposals of six states have been rejected for this year’s parade. While four of them – Maharashtra, Bengal, Kerala and Delhi – are ruled by opposition parties, BJP and its allies are at the helm of affairs in Bihar and Haryana . Delhi government’s proposal showcasing “city’s secular heritage”, which was submitted by the Sahitya Kala Parishad , was among the tableau presentations which did not qualify for the parade.Five rounds of meetings take place before the final list is made by the defence ministry. Delhi government sources said its proposal was eliminated in the last round.Terming the rejection of proposals as a “conspiracy”, Sena MP Sanjay Raut said: “Maharashtra has got awards for its tableau most of the times. What has happened this time that Maharashtra and West Bengal were not included? Both states don't have BJP governments. Is this the reason?”NCP MP Supriya Sule said it was expected that the Centre would give representation to all states in the Republic Day parade as it is a “national festival”. “The Centre is behaving in a prejudiced manner and is giving the states ruled by the opposition a step-motherly treatment,"" she said.Bengal minister Tapas Roy said the proposal, focussing on the state government’s Kanyashree project for girl students, was rejected because Trinamool has opposed “anti-people laws” such as Citizenship (Amendment) Act. “BJP has insulted the people of Bengal and they would get a befitting reply for it in future,” he said.Col Diptangshu Choudhury (retd), advisor to Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee , said: “How can they reject the Kanyashree project, which had been awarded by the UN?” Former Bengal minister Madan Mitra said: “I think they are suffering from fear psychosis. They can cancel the tableau of Bengal in Delhi, but Bengal will cancel both CAA and NRC.”Incidentally, for the first time, J&K would be represented in the parade as a Union territory. The theme of the tableau, “Back to Village”, depicts the arts of the region like shawl weaving and Basohli paintings with pictures of Krishna and Radha.Maharashtra had sent four proposals — on the 175-year-old journey of theatre in the state; 350th anniversary of the naval fleet set up by Maratha ruler Kanhoji Angre; the story of Maharashtra's traditional wear and the centenary year of Geet Ramayana.Sources from the culture department, which sends the proposals, said this is not the first time that their idea has been rejected. “There have been at least 10 times when the ideas were rejected, the first one in 1972,” said an officer, adding that the last time a proposal was turned down was in 2016.The defence ministry said in a statement that out of total 56 proposals (of which 32 were from states and Union territories), only 22 were selected for this year's parade after a series of five meetings. Of these, 16 are from states and UTs. The ministry said Bengal’s proposal was not taken forward for further consideration after the second meeting. “It is pertinent to mention here that the tableau of Bengal government was shortlisted for participation in Republic Day Parade in 2019 as an outcome of the same process,” the ministry added.The proposal of Bihar, where NDA parties are in power, too was rejected by the state government. Bihar’s proposal focussed on the Jal-Jivan-Hariyali Mission. “The defence ministry said that as per the set criteria for Republic Day parade, state governments cannot make their tableaux on such a theme,” a senior official at the Bihar Information Centre said.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73077067,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1457949,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/political-row-as-bengal-maharashtra-tableaux-rejected/articleshow/73077051.cms

NEW DELHI: Asserting that BJP has launched a countrywide campaign to convince people about the new citizenship law, BJP president and home minister Amit Shah on Thursday said protests were politically driven and asked Congress why violence did not take place in states where opposition parties are in office.“Today I am making this allegation publicly that the protests were politically motivated, which explains the fact that no violence took place in states where BJP is not in power. It explains the intent behind the protests. Opposition parties, mainly Congress, should explain as why protests were violent only in the BJP-ruled states,” Shah said at a media summit here.The home minister said the violent protests took place selectively. “People of the country know well who are behind violence,” Shah said and once again justified the police action against those indulging in violence. Police can’t sit idle if buses are being burnt and arson is taking place, he said.Noting Congress and other opposition parties are left with no issues and are sponsoring protests to create apprehensions in the public mind, Shah said CAA is about giving citizenship and not about taking away any one’s, which people should understand and not fall in the opposition trap. He also repeated that a nationwide National Register of Citizens is not currently under consideration.He asked Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Vadra to explain how CAA will harm the poor and minorities. “Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Vadra are speaking pure lies. I reiterate citizenship of no Indian will be lost due to the new law and we have launched a countrywide campaign to make people understand this,” Shah said.The home minister also criticised opposition parties for attacking the National Population Register, a census-related exercise. “The criticism of a few people cannot stall the country. NPR is needed to frame schemes for the poor and it is a disservice to create doubts in the public over this,” he said.He said the government is confident about public support to the new law but the opposition managed to convince certain people against it after which a campaign was launched to make them aware as they are being misguided for political reasons and there was no merit in protests.Shah asserted that the citizenship being given to six minorities from three neighbouring countries, who had fled religious persecution, was as per norms and also in accordance with the promises given to them by the prominent leaders of the country like Mahatma Gandhi , Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel.“Most of country’s leaders at the time of Partition promised that religious minorities in Pakistan or Bangladesh will be welcome in India whenever they come. We have ensured a dignified life to them as per the wishes of our top leaders. They are our brothers,” Shah said. He clarified that the minorities from the neighbouring countries, who have settled in India, are not different of other Indians and they have to be accepted by the country and should be ensured a normal life in India.“The minorities from the neighbouring countries are our own people. They were very much Indians before Partition. They were assured that they will be welcome in India whenever they want,” Shah said.About recent incident when Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan was allegedly heckled by historian Irfan Habib, Shah said, “It was for the state to take action against the person who heckled the governor, which is a constitutional position. However, I say with conviction that the government of India took the incident very seriously.”On recent Jharkhand defeat, Shah said as party president he takes responsibility of the defeat and the party is looking into the reasons behind the loss.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73077070,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1577268,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shah-why-have-non-bjp-states-not-seen-violence/articleshow/73077071.cms

27,['3/01/2020'],Describing Faiz’s poem as anti-Hindu absurd and funny: Javed Akhtar,"NEW DELHI: Poet Javed Akhtar and renowned Urdu theorist Gopichand Narang have questioned and countered the view that a poem by the renowned sub-continent Urdu poet Faiz Ahmad Faiz is anti-Hindu in nature.Narang said that Faiz used a lot of metaphors in his poetry which should not be taken literally. “Faiz was a communist poet. He was a poet for peace, love, freedom and social justice. This poem was written against Gen Zia-ul-Haq, the martial law administrator. There is nothing communal or anti-Hindu in it. The poem is metaphorical. But in the poem means anything that is lifeless,” said Narang, a Sahitya Akademi recipient.The lines from the nazm, Hum Dekhenge, which have come under scrutiny are: “Jab arz-e-Khuda ke Ka’abe se, sab buut uthwaae jaayenge / Hum ahl-e-safa mardood-e-haram, masnad pe bithaaye jaayenge / Sab taaj uchhale jaayenge, sab takht giraaye jaayenge/ Bas naam rahega Allah ka, hum dekhenge.”The translation put out by rekhta.org goes: “When from the sacred square of the Kaaba / Idols of false Gods will be uprooted / When to us rootless and unwanted / Seats of power will be granted / All crowns will be tossed into the air / All thrones ground to dust / Only the name of Allah will prevail / We will see!”“Describing Faiz’s poem as anti-Hindu is both absurd and funny. He was a leading star of the Progressive Writers’ movement in undivided India. He spent half his years outside Pakistan because he was being labelled anti-Pakistan. He wrote this poem against the regressive, communal and fundamentalist Zia-ul-Haq government,” Akhtar told ANI.In 1980s, a Zia-ul-Haq decree prohibited women from wearing saris. Pakistan’s singer Iqbal Bano, clad in a black sari, protested against the decree singing this nazm of Faiz in front of a crowd 50,000 strong in a Lahore stadium, according to rekhta.org.Meanwhile, a PTI report says that IIT-Kanpur director Abhay Karandikar has criticised a section of the media for reporting since Wednesday that the institute has set up a committee to decide whether the poem by Faiz is anti-Hindu or not, saying this is ""very misleading"".""The reality is that the institute has received complaints from multiple sections of the community that during a protest march taken out by students a certain poem was read and then subsequently certain social media posts were made, which were inflammatory,"" Karandikar said.""The institute has also received complaints from other sections of the community that during the protest march, a group tried to block the march, which was incorrect. So, the institute has set up a committee to look into all these complaints to see if they are genuine. And if they are genuine, what remedial action is to be taken,"" he added.IIT-Kanpur students had sung the Faiz poem during a campus march on Dec 17 in support of the students of Jamia Millia Islamia protesting against CAA.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73077086,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1379472/73077086.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/describing-faizs-poem-as-anti-hindu-absurd-and-funny-javed-akhtar/articleshow/73077088.cms

29,['3/01/2020'],Racket busted but ATM data still at risk: Kolkata cops,"One of the ATMs that was hit

KOLKATA: Have you been a victim of ATM skimming or had merely visited an ATM recently after which your bank had asked you to replace your old debit card? There is a reason why they are doing so as a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), said cops. There is always a danger that even after the arrest of the main conspirators, your data is still at risk of being circulated for a price, officers said.The police said the two Romanians arrested in the Jadavpur and Tollygunge Phanri skimming cases have revealed they had been regularly buying and selling data of bank customers back home. “The Romanian fraudsters usually adopt two methods to carry out their crimes. The simple way is to buy the data obtained through skimming in India from the dark web and then they come down to Kolkata to withdraw money from the Indian ATMs. Similarly, they might just collect card data by installing skimming devices and carry the data back. They can then just withdraw the money from Indian ATMs using their own third-party contacts or sell the same to other gangs,” explained a senior officer.However, cops said they were yet to come across any fresh complaints in Kolkata. “All banks have proactively ensured all steps were taken so that the data collected from Kolkata — but not used in the fraud — couldn’t be used for criminal purposes on the dark web. The fact that we recovered crypto currency from main accused Siliviu Florin Spiridon, 28, led us to unearth their modus operandi. So far, data of 250 people has been recovered. He has claimed he has sold some of it. But since only 81 victims were duped so far, we couldn’t take any chance. A second laptop belonging to the other accused, Tousif Mouraru, which allegedly contains data of another 300-odd people, is yet to be recovered,” explained an officer.The police said Spiridon had learnt his trade from his friends who were involved in such skimming in India and the US earlier. “He is a master at retrieving the data from the machine after detaching it from the ATM. He handled all the data collection on behalf of the gang and was instrumental in converting the money that the gang defrauded into Euros and bitcoins, which he then sent back to Romania,” said an officer.“We broke up his modus operandi into different segments. We found at least two to three steps which can be detected externally with a bit of technical assistance and hence, stopped before the crime is executed. We will discuss his modus operandi — which we have videographed for easy comprehension 1 — extensively with the bank authorities,” said a source from the anti-bank fraud section.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73093065,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-644640,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/racket-busted-but-atm-data-still-at-risk-cops/articleshow/73091156.cms

KOLKATA: Three men were arrested on Friday for the robbery at a wine shop in Kasba on Rasbehari Avenue connector in the early hours of last Monday. The accused had looted more than Rs 2 lakh in cash and dozens of expensive foreign liquor bottles before hitting a police patrol van and fleeing in a white SUV with a “police” sticker on the windshield. The three persons were identified as Palash Santra, Rajveer Singh and Gous Alam. The police also seized a substantial amount of the stolen cash, wine bottles, the SUV and house-breaking equipment from the accused.

Cops said the night before, they had robbed another wine shop in Garfa, making off with around Rs 3 lakh in cash and several bottles of foreign liquor.

Police said that during investigation, they scrutinized footage from 35 CCTV cameras and managed to establish the route taken by the robbers — towards Kamalgazi. With the help of high-speed cameras, officers also found the registration number of the SUV the accused used.

“Cameras under Bengal police were also scrutinised and eventually a relatively small area was fixed upon. Manual source, foot patrol and all out efforts were put into tracing the vehicle, which was located. We trailed the vehicle and managed to bust the entire inter-state racket,” said a senior officer of Kolkata Police.

CUTTACK: Orissa High Court has observed that film producer and Rose Valley scam accused Shrikant Mohta promoted the alleged Ponzi firm’s illegal business through feature films produced by Shree Venkatesh Films Pvt Ltd (SVFPL). Mohta is SVFPL’s co-founder.

Single-judge vench of Justice S K Sahoo observed this while rejecting Mohta’s bail plea on Thursday.

“Lucrative offer and mirage of huge out-turn on investments as projected successfully during telecast of Bengali feature films produced by SVFPL in satellite channel ‘Rupashi Bangla’ mesmerized gullible investors, who could not realise that all that glitters is not gold,” the court observed.

“For collecting pearl of high interest, they (investors) drowned themselves in the sea of treachery. Before they could wake up from their deep slumber, they had already been trapped and squeezed and were left only with tears in their eyes which never dried up. The incomprehensible pain and sufferings of those hundreds and thousands of investors are apparent and nobody knows when and how they would get back their money,” stated the court. It further observed that the businessmen have played the game with people’s money very cunningly with active support of some high-level politicians, police officers and film personalities.

Mohta was arrested by the CBI on January 24 last year for his alleged links with Rose Valley. He has since been in judicial custody at the Jharpada jail. Mohta is accused of entering into a conspiracy with Rose Valley’s sister concern Brand Value Communication Limited (BVCL) and embezzling crores on the pretext of producing films.

Justice Sahoo said the deception by Rose Valley was continuing when the petitioner joined the accused, group managing director Gautam Kundu, and the plan was chalked out secretly and the petitioner performed his part successfully and thereby the investment in Rose Valley increased substantially.

Nagpur: The Abujmadh operation against Maoists along the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border on November 30 last year is learnt to have dealt a decisive blow to the rebels. It led to the exposure of their significant strategic guerrilla warfare base. Two of their cadres were also neutralized in the operation conducted by C-60 commandos .

The operation, which took place across Indravati river in Chhattisgarh, led to busting of a training camp where Maoists were grooming recruits with arms and physical training. The place, part of the Maoist-dominated Abujmadh, is also known to be the location where several rebel hideouts are present. Abujmadh is also part of Central India’s almost inaccessible and sparsely populated ‘Dandakaranya region’.

Around a year ago, C-60 commandos had stormed a camp in Abujmadh where, for the first time, four horses were seized. The horses were used by senior Maoists cadres in the hideouts as a mode of transport on the forested stretch. A couple of senior cadres had managed to flee.

SP Shailesh Balkawade said the location where the latest camp was busted is strategically crucial for the Maoists who thought that security forces could not access it. “The raid by security forces in one of their safe havens shocked the Maoists. Apart from the casualties, arms and ammunitions of Maoists were also seized. The operation was unbelievable for the Maoists,” he said.

The camping site was a forested stretch where Maoists conducted their internal meetings routinely, halting comfortably for a day or two without having to worry about being found. “The south sub-zonal bureau committee members from south Chhattisgarh’s Bastar, Bijapur and other districts met the south sub-zonal bureau committee which had Gadchiroli district under it. The two committees met at this point and discussed their future plans, assessed the current situation related to the strength and movements of the security forces and other issues,” said Balkawade.

“It was a regular practice for Maoists to gather villagers from adjoining hamlets to attend camps here and help them,” said the SP.

Balkawade also said that the place raided by the C-60 commandos also served as the gateway for Abujmadh. “Senior cadres like Bhupathi and Tarakka visited these camps and also participated in meetings. They also used this place to enter or exit Abujmadh for medical and other emergencies,” he said.

“Now, the Maoists have to think many times before considering the place as a safe haven,” he added.

34,['3/01/2020'],Zero response to NMC’s move to regularize mobile towers,"This story is from January 3, 2020

Nagpur: Mobile phone companies have failed to regularize 751 mobile towers across the city. The companies have also defaulted on NMC ’s property tax to the tune of Rs8.63 crore.

The one-year grace period to regularize mobile towers will end this month. Now, the NMC has decided to levy fine on property owners for allowing installation of mobile towers without mandatory permissions.

A senior NMC town planning department official told TOI that all mobile phone companies had erected towers on private properties by not taking permission from the NMC.

Following a petition in 2014, the high court had directed the NMC to prepare a policy to regularize existing mobile towers. The HC had also asked the NMC not to take any coercive action, including seizing of towers, as it will hamper mobile phone services.

In 2018, the state government had issued a circular directing the NMC to prepare a policy for the same. Subsequently, the town planning department prepared three categories to regularize the existing towers — occupancy certificate and sanction plan, sanction plan but no occupancy certificate and nothing among the two categories.

But with zero response, the department in February last year extended the period to regularize mobile phone towers by inviting applications from owners of cellular companies till January 2020, the official said.

Still it received very poor response as only 169 applications were submitted till the end of December 2019. But all the applications are short of the requisite documents for regularization.

Similar conditions will also be considered while giving permissions for erecting new towers, the official said.

Now, the town planning department has decided to invoke sections 53 and 54 of the Maharashtra Town Planning Act which empowers the civic body to force the owners of the buildings to regularize mobile towers or the NMC can levy fine as per ready reckoner rate of the value of the property.

The norms allow the NMC to levy penalty up to four times of the ready reckoner value of the property where mobile towers were erected.

HYDERABAD: While the city is yet to recover from the brutal gangrape and murder of 27-year-old veterinary doctor Disha by four inebriated youth, who even forced alcohol into her mouth, a new study on violent criminals housed at Chanchalguda Central Prison revealed that most crimes were committed under the influence of alcohol.The study, carried out jointly by Institute of Mental Health, Osmania Medical College and Institute of Medical Sciences Adilabad, aimed at finding mental health co-morbidities in 65 offenders. The researchers found that only 3% of the offenders had some psychiatric problems. The study ‘Crime Characteristics and Psychiatric Morbidity in Violent Offenders’ included participating offenders, involved in crimes like murder and attempt to murder, dacoity, rape, robbery, abetment to suicide etc. In conclusion, the study suggested measures to control alcohol dependency, thereby curb such crimes.The aim was to understand various socio-demographic factors, crime characteristics and psychiatric morbidity in violent offenders as violence and psychopathology were believed to be interrelated. “Persons with mental illness can present with high violent behaviour and, on the other hand, criminals can have co morbid psychopathology. By analysing factors responsible for violent criminal behaviour and whether psychopathology is contributing to the same, a criminal profile for predicting recidivism in violent offenders,” the study added.The researchers — Dr Anitha Rayirala, Dr K Sudha Rani , Dr Divija Bunga and Dr Umashankar — said in the study: “It is remarkable to know that no one had other psychiatric symptoms apart from substance dependence and intoxication at the time of commission of crime. We found 58.4% subjects with alcohol dependence, and most of the crimes were committed on relatives, mostly spouses. Majority were directly or indirectly due to use of alcohol most probably, since no other psychiatric illness or underlying personality disorders could be diagnosed. Only 3.3% had antisocial personality traits, which is not significant.”Researchers said, “More awareness programmes and campaigns regarding influence of alcohol on crimes can be conducted with the help of police, government, private organisations and media, especially in vulnerable and at risk population for crime, which would indirectly decrease alcohol intake in vulnerable population and decrease crime rate.”",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73065240,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-31392,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/most-crimes-under-influence-of-liquor-study/articleshow/73062466.cms

Representative image

SIRCILLA: Police thrashed a group of New Year revellers for creating nuisance in an inebriated condition and assaulting two men —Srinivas and Kumar — with iron rods in Sircilla in the early hours of Wednesday.

According to police, they received an alert about miscreants causing nuisance near HP Petrol Pump in Sircilla town at 1am. “Our teams, conducting drunken driving checks and on patrolling duty, rushed to the spot and noticed that a group of youngsters, carrying iron rods, chain and sticks, were roaming on the Karimnagar-Sircilla road. They had assaulted and injured two men and also tried to barge into a house,” Sircilla town circle inspector Venkata Narsaiah said.

On seeing police, some members of the group fled from the spot and three miscreants were nabbed. “They were under the influence of alcohol and did not cooperate with police. Our teams had to use batons to control them,” the CI added.

Two video clips, where police were seen thrashing three youngsters using batons and a stick, went viral on social media, mocking cops for their ‘friendly policing’ methods.

Sircilla superintendent of police (SP) Rahul Hegde said the miscreants were cutting cake on the road side near the petrol pump when an argument broke out between them and another group, who came to fill petrol in their vehicles. “During the argument over a petty issue, the miscreants, who were cutting cake, assaulted the members of other group with iron rods. They further caused panic by trying to barge into a house. The video of police using batons was circulated on the Internet , but the video of the miscreants assaulting people using iron rod, chain and a stick and creating panic on the street was not put up,” the SP said.

According to police, the accused also broke beer bottles on the road. “Based on the complaint of Srinivas, we booked a case against Sone, 20, an unemployed youth who discontinued engineering, and four of his associates under Sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt.), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 506 (criminal intimidation), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapon), 186 (obstructing public servant from discharging his duty) r/w 149 of the IPC,” the CI said. Some of the accused have been reportedly taken into custody.

37,['3/01/2020'],"States get ready to conduct Phase-IV tiger monitoring, kick off in Maha on Jan 15","This story is from January 3, 2020

Nagpur: In order to bring the minimum number more close to the estimated population of tigers, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has asked tiger-bearing states to conduct Phase-IV monitoring.

“The objective is to at least obtain minimum number of tigers in a tiger reserve. But areas outside the reserves are equally important, especially from viewpoint of gene flow. While All India Tiger Estimation (AITE) is about estimation every four years, Phase-IV is an annual affair,” said NTCA member-secretary Anup Kumar Nayak.

“We have started training of staff and collection of required number of camera traps, coordination with states and preparatory meetings are going on. The NTCA will fund this exercise from centrally sponsored scheme (CSS) for procurement of field equipment and capacity building,” said Nayak.

As per the analysis of AITE-2018 data, more than 80% (2,461) of the 2,967 tigers were individually identified/photo-captured as minimum numbers of tigers in the country. “Phase-IV monitoring is an opportunity for tiger states to conduct the exercise for current year to bring minimum number closer to the estimated number,” adds Nayak.

Pertinently, the NTCA is yet to release the number of tigers present in sanctuaries and reserves across India. The break-up of 2,967 was to be given in August and then before December 31 last year.

As per the mandate of Phase-IV, the states will conduct the exercise themselves, though support for capacity building, training, and hand-holding of field staff will be provided by the NTCA’s regional offices and NGOs.

The count will be done as per the same specification as per AITE-2018 where grid size of 2sqkm was taken to place camera traps. The exercise was supposed to start from October 2018 till May 15, 2020 but states are yet to formulate schedules.

In Maharashtra, the exercise is expected to start from January 15. As per the 4th cycle of AITE-2018, the state has 312 tigers, a rise by 122 tigers from 2014 when the number was 190.

State’s chief wildlife warden Nitin H Kakodkar said, “A meeting was held on December 27, in which all modalities were discussed. The exercise will find out density of herbivores, carnivore signs followed by installation of camera traps. The 5-day schedule will involve walking on transect line (Phase-I) too. We will involve sensitized individuals and NGOs in the exercise.”

Kakodkar informed that in fringe areas of Melghat tiger reserve the exercise has already started. Training is being given by Wildlife Institute of India (WII) researchers who are working on various projects in the region.

“We are also involving Wildlife Research & Conservation Society (WRCS), Pune, and Wildlife Conservation Society (WCT), Mumbai. They will work in areas outside tiger reserves. Pench field director Ravikiran Govekar has been appointed as nodal officer for Phase-IV,” he added.

Govekar said the exercise will be undertaken in 28 areas including protected areas (PAs) and also sanctuaries like Pranhita & Chaprala in Gadchiroli, Painganga in Yavatmal and Ghodazari in Brahmapuri.

Areas outside PAs like Brahmapuri, Wadsa, Central & West Chanda, Nagpur, Pandharkawda, Bhandara, Sawantwadi, Muktai Nagar (Jalgaon) will also be covered. All FDCM divisions in Chandrapur district have been included, he added.

Due to left-wing extremism threat, no camera trapping will be done in Pranhita and Chaprala. In these areas, sign survey, scat collection and line transect exercise will be carried out.

“The line transect exercise in relatively low density areas like Painganga, Pranhita, Tipeshwar etc is also to find out scientifically the prey density as a preparatory phase for conservation translocation in future,” said Govekar.

Govekar further added, “It is possible that there may be tiger bearing areas which did not record presence of tigers during the survey period. In Phase-IV, we will cover them.”

THE PLAN

* Phase IV involves estimating population of tigers and its prey

* Intensive monitoring of tiger source populations in tiger reserves and PAs in each tiger landscape complex will be done.

* Camera trap density one pair per 2 sqkm will be installed

* Minimum trap nights of 1,000 per 100 sqkm

* 25 pairs of cameras in 100 sqkm for 60 days

* Transects line to be minimum of 2km length

* Obtaining minimum tiger numbers through DNA analysis from scats in select areas

38,['3/01/2020'],RFSL conducts 40 tests in 25 days in minor’s rape and murder case,"This story is from January 3, 2020

Nagpur: The Regional Forensic Science Laboratory (RFSL) on Thursday handed over its DNA test findings in a minor girl’s rape and murder case to the rural police after completing 40 tests in just 25 days. The rape and murder, which took place in December last year, had triggered outrage in Kalmeshwar tehsil.

Police had coordinated with RFSL for gathering evidence from the crime spot immediately after the five-year-old girl was found raped and murdered at a farm in a village, around 40km from Nagpur, in the tehsil.

After submitting the exhibits, superintendent of police (SP) Rakesh Ola and his team had sought the DNA report in the quickest possible time.

Rural police have suggested name of senior counsel Prashant Sathianathan to the government for appointing as special public prosecutor to conduct the trial before the fast track court.

It is reliably learnt that the charge sheet is being prepared under SP Ola and addl SP Monica Raut.

Armed with the DNA report, the rural police is learnt to be gearing up to submit a legally strong charge sheet to ensure capital punishment in the case as per the amended rule under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.

The district women and child welfare committee, along with district child protection officer, had visited the place after the incident. Following the visit, the defunct taluka-level child protection committee at Kalmeshwar was revived and awareness programmes started for minors on avoiding sexual exploitations.

It’s reliably learnt that RFSL’s deputy director Vijay Thakare had guided senior police officials at the spot through video calling for collecting evidence in a proper manner. Thakare ensured the process of collecting the exhibits was completed in a legal manner.

The girl was befriended by one Sanjay Puri, now behind bars after his arrest in the case, who had followed her to the farm before allegedly attacking her on December 6 last year. He had pinned down the girl to force himself upon her.

According to sources, the girl’s screaming and resistance had taken Puri by surprise. One of the girl’s relatives who was working in the vicinity had failed to hear the victim’s screams.

As the victim kept fighting, Puri allegedly assaulted her with a stone until she had fallen silent. He then fled the spot leaving the body there. Though an outsider for the village, he did not flee the village or dispose off the body. Puri was nabbed by Kalmeshwar police just when he was making plans to flee.

Police had a hard time in bringing the situation under control after the rape and murder came to fore. Agitators had also called bandh at the taluka a day after the incident.

39,['3/01/2020'],Kashmir fire heroes among 30 honoured by Shah,"This story is from January 3, 2020

Nagpur: Thirty fire service officials, including six heroes from Jammu and Kashmir, were honoured with gallantry awards at the hands of Union Home minister Amit Shah during investiture ceremony at National Fire Service College (NFSC) at Raj Nagar on Thursday.

Of the six from J&K, Abdul Majid Wani was conferred the top award posthumously. Total 11 heroes comprising a team of nine from Ludhiana alone, lost their lives in fire and rescue operations between December 2017 and March this year in different parts of the country. Rest belonged to Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Mumbai. So far, the awards used to be handed over by respective governors in their home state.

Wani’s son Jan Mohammad Wani (32), who works as a government officer, was the first to receive the medal from Shah. “This is the honour given to us by the nation. Life has been very difficult without him (Wani). We miss him every day. It was a big shock when he went for work as usual but never returned. We are proud he laid down his life to save people and their assets,” said Jan.

Union minister Nitin Gadkari, MoS for Home affairs Nitayanand Rai, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis, DG Fire Service Nageshwar Rao, DG NDRF SN Pradhan, NMC fire officer Rajendra Uchake, VNIT chairman Vishram Jamdar and director Pramod Padole and others were present.

Shah, who is called the brain behind abrogation of Article 370 in J&K, said the fire safety and disaster management had been neglected until 2014. “Prime minister Narendra Modi gave special attention on these two sectors and in four years after 2016, NDRF and fire service have been strengthened across the country,” he said.

The home minister said the two forces have been able to minimize damage to human lives and their assets to a large extent. “In three recent cyclones, just 64 people were killed. It looks like a big figure and I agree that not a single citizen must lose his life but a single supercyclone in Odisha had killed 10,000,” he said.

Taking potshots at Congress, the BJP heavyweight said during their time, projects would drag on for years while under Modi government they are completed on time referring to upcoming NDRF Academy on Koradi Road for which he laid the foundation stone from NFSC campus. “First Congress government used to lay the foundation, second would allot funds followed by starting the work and completion by the fourth. I have got a word from DG that the academy would be ready in 18 months,” Shah said.

NFSC campus work had started in 2010 and dragged on for over 9 years. Shah dedicated the 43-acre state-of-the-art NFSC campus to nation on the occasion.

Reiterating Modi’s stand, Shah said India’s will be 5 trillion economy in next five years though we are trying to do it before 75th anniversary of Independence.

File photo

NEW DELHI: The Union home ministry has merged its internal security-I division — which was handling matters relating to security clearances, communal harmony and Ayodhya-related court cases — with internal security-II division — which dealt with mutual legal assistance pacts, extradition requests & National Security Act matters — as part of an exercise to reorganise its divisions. The merged division will be called “internal security division,” the ministry said in an office order issued on December 31, 2019.

Importantly, all files concerning Ayodhya matters and related court judgments will henceforth be put up by the deputy secretary in charge of national integration, a subject matter of internal security-I division, to additional secretary (Jammu, Kashmir & Ladakh affairs) through joint secretary (JKL). “This is for sheer administrative ease. The joint secretary of the merged internal security division, Punya Salila Srivastava, has too many matters to handle in wake of the reorganisation, apart from the women’s safety division she is also in charge of,” a home minister officer said adding that national integration wing would continue to be part of the internal security division as before.

The entrusting of separate charge for Ayodhya matters to AS(JKL) comes even as the home ministry is working on contours of the trust it needs to set up by February, as directed by the Supreme Court, for construction of Ram temple at the Ayodhya site. Besides, an alternative piece of land for the mosque needs to be identified. This would mean considerable amount of work in the coming days, an officer said pointing to the possible reason why the home ministry decided not to burden joint secretary (internal security) with Ayodhya-related matters.

As per the office order issued by the ministry with respect to the reorganisation of divisions and allocation of work at the level of joint secretary, all files/papers of additional secretary in charge of police modernisation, would henceforth be routed through secretary (border management).

Indore: The Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) has issued a warning to Dewas Municipal Corporation (DMC) for allegedly capturing stray dogs with metal pincers .

The board has directed the corporation to stop catching of stray dogs by metal tongs. The civic body has also been asked to take appropriate action and share about the action taken by it with the board.

The warning has been issued as animal activists of Dewas had complained against DMC staff for allegedly catching stray dogs in inhumane way with metal pincers to People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) India. Subsequently, Peta raised a complaint with the AWBI in this regard.

“The issue of catching stray dogs in Dewas with metal tongs and their relocation was brought to our notice by some local activists. We are working on it. We are in touch with district administration, including DMC commissioner to stop the illegal activities,” said Peta in a statement.

Peta has also recommended for disciplinary action be taken against erring employees. It has instructed the DMC to train its staff on laws and guidelines for capturing dogs for Animal Birth Control programme.

DMC commissioner Sanjana Jain, however, claimed that all recommended guidelines and procedures were being followed by the civic body staff for sterilization work.

“People engaged in catching stray dogs with metal pincers are hired by locals when their kids are attacked by the animals. After care of stray dogs especially female ones is another issue with which we have to deal because locals do not allow our staff to leave a dog caught by us in the same area,” she said

Animal activists on contrary accused DMC of issuing false statement to mislead people. “DMC is just playing tricks by issuing misleading statement. The staff engaged in catching stray dogs with metallic pincers are using vehicles of the civic body,” alleged Roopa Patvardhan, one of the animal activists.

“The corporation’s staff also drop dogs back to their area after surgery,” she added.

Nagpur: Delivering a rare verdict, the Additional District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum awarded two years’ jail term to a builder for contempt of its order and also issued an arrest warrant against him. He managed to secure a temporary stay to the order from the state commission on a condition that he should pay entire amount as directed by the forum to complainant, who is a senior citizen.

While awarding stringent punishment to the Sunil Fating, proprietor of Pride Real Estate, a bench comprising president Shekhar Mule and members — Smita Chandekar and Avinash Prabhune — observed that the builder didn’t deserve any leniency for not executing forum’s orders of September 4, 2018, and also deliberately skipping judgment day hearing.

According to them, such stringent punishments are must for such elements which would act as deterrent. They also slapped Rs10,000 fine on the builder of which Rs5,000 is to be given to the complaint towards litigation cost.

In September 4, 2014’s order, the builder was directed to refund the complainant Pusha Sengraphwar’s Rs1.08 lakh taken for purchase of a plot from her from December 28, 2010 with 15% interest. He was also slapped with Rs25,000 fine towards physical and mental harassment along with litigation cost. He was given two options of either to refund complainant’s amount with 15% interest or as per current market value, whichever is higher. When he failed to comply with the order within 30 days deadline, the complainant filed execution (contempt) case.

Sengraphwar, a resident of Hudekeshwar, purchased a plot from Fating in 2010 by paying Rs1.08 lakh. When he failed to handover the property for many years, she filed a case in the forum. When he failed to respond to forum’s notices, a non-bailable warrant was issued against him after which the police produced him before the judges. He then admitted his mistake and paid Rs25,000 cost in July last year. He promised to pay remaining amount soon while citing excuses that one of his partners expired and other resigned and therefore, it would take time to remove their names from the property documents.

When he still failed to refund remaining amount, Sengraphwar filed contempt case in March 2018. The forum decided to pronounce verdict and conveyed to him to remain present. When he didn’t turn up, the judges awarded him two years imprisonment as per Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act. They observed that the Fating not only failed to submit any document for his excuses, but also deliberately skipped the order date. Moreover, he didn’t file any appeal in higher court against forum’s first order of September 2018. He not only misled the forum, but also failed to engage any lawyer to plead his case. “If he’s disrespecting court’s orders, we can imagine how he should have behaved with the aggrieved complainant, who is a senior citizen,” the judges said.

Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray and NCP leader Ajit Pawar (L)

MUMBAI: A day after NCP leader and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that portfolios would be declared on Thursday, no portfolios were announced following fresh demands raised by the Congress.

A senior NCP cabinet member told TOI that the Congress has asked for agriculture and industries or transport. “The Congress had earlier staked claim on urban development, agriculture and transport. Now it has dropped its claim on urban development but is still insisting on industries and transport,” he said.

The minister said delay in allotting portfolios was a major embarrassment for chief minister Uddhav Thackeray . “It has adversely affected the credibility of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government. First there was delay in swearing in of the chief minister, then further delay in cabinet expansion and now, no one in the government knows when the portfolios will be declared,” he said.

He said that initially, it was declared that portfolios would be announced on the day of the cabinet expansion but since that day, that is, December 30, there has been complete uncertainty over allotment of departments.

The NCP cabinet member said prima facie it appears that Congress is responsible for the delay. “Our information is that initially, there was an internal dispute in the Congress over allotment of portfolios. Both Ashok Chavan and Balasaheb Thorat had staked claim on the revenue department, while Nitin Raut had staked claim on the public works department. When Chavan found that he may not get revenue, he too had asked for PWD,” he said.

Both Thorat and Chavan did not respond on TOI queries on the delay in allotting portfolios.

They were reassured that immortality of art is not an abstraction; it is the faith in beauty which unites the performer and the listener.“The Dhrupad mission will go on,” Pandit Umakant Gundecha told TOI. “Pandit Ramakant Gundecha was ‘vadi swar’ — pure note. The work I undertook with him will be continued with his son, Anant.” Pandit Umakant and Anant Gundecha will perform on January 9 at Saptak.The imperishable force of beauty was also demonstrated by the Saptak custodian, Manju Mehta. Her Raga Tilak Shyam essay was praised by Pandit Jasraj. He said she had presented her guru Pandit Ravi Shankar’s oeuvre with felicity. “Pandit Ravi Shankar had created that raga,” Mehta told TOI. “His composition for ‘Jaane kaise sapnon mein kho gayee akhiyaan’ in the film ‘Anuradha’ is based on Tilak Shyam.” And Begum Parveen Sultana ’s Maru Bihag showed that Hindustani dil is as strong as ever.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73087300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-74829,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hindustani-dil-as-strong-as-ever/articleshow/73087300.cms

Prime Minister Narendra Modi (file photo)

TUMAKURU: PM Narendra Modi on Thursday lashed out at Congress and its allies for opposing the new citizenship law, saying they should explain why processions were being taken out against “Dalits and other religious minorities” seeking sanctuary in India while being “silent on Pakistan”, from where these refugees had fled “to save themselves and their daughters”.

Addressing students at the Sri Siddaganga Mutt in Tumakuru, 70km from Bengaluru, Modi said, “Those who have come to India are refugees from Pakistan since they were denied religious freedom there. Many Dalits and members of other minority communities there have been under constant attack. While we are trying to grant them citizenship, Congress has launched protests (against the move).”

The PM, who is on a two-day visit to Karnataka, said if Congress and its allies wanted to protest, their target should have been Pakistan. “Today, every Indian has a question: why are they (Congress and its allies) silent on Pakistan, which has committed atrocities on these people (refugees)?”

Modi accused Congress of keeping quiet for 70 years even as Pakistan “exploited members of the Dalit and other minority communities”.

“What prevented the party from raising the issue at an international level? If you (Congress) must raise slogans, then highlight the way minorities are tortured in Pakistan. If you must stage a procession, then support exploited Hindu minorities who have come to India from Pakistan,’’ Modi said in defence of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

“We can’t leave minorities from Pakistan to their fate. We have a responsibility to protect them. But Congress and its allies don’t speak against Pakistan; instead, they stage rallies against refugees and Parliament,’’ he added.

Congress immediately hit back at Modi, saying its anti-CAA agitation was against his “divisive policies and not against Parliament”.

“Modiji, this agitation is not against Parliament but against your divisive work. We will not let you break the country. So far as Pakistan is concerned, India taught them a lesson in 1948, 1965, 1971 and in Kargil, and inflicted so many wounds that they are not being able to cope with them. If you want to reply to Pakistan, stop playing games of biryani and mangoes,” the party said.

Former Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah criticised the PM for making a political speech in the presence of children “on the holy soil of the Siddaganga mutt”, which he described as “an apolitical, secular place”.

47,['3/01/2020'],Hindutva right connotation for Hindus: RSS leader in book,"This story is from January 3, 2020

NEW DELHI: Unfazed by criticism that it seeks creation of a “Hindu Rashtra”, RSS has asserted that “Hindutva” and not “Hinduism” is the right connotation for Hindus as “isms” indicated “rigid dogmas” and leave no space to evolve and accommodate contemporary changes in society.

J Nandkumar, national convenor of RSS think-tank “Prajna Pravah”, has authored a book “Hindutva in Changing Times”, where he justifies the “Hindutva” terminology. The book was released by senior RSS functionary Krishna Gopal here on Thursday. “It is Hindutva of India that keeps the whole country united,” Gopal said at the launch ceremony.

Nandakumar calls for reclaiming of West Bengal by a “nationalist government” and asserts the need to reinstate “democracy and constitutional supremacy”. The RSS functionary has alleged in the book that Mamata Bannerjee-led government in West Bengal has put restrictions on Hindu festivals in some areas with considerable Muslim presence to “appease Islamic radicals”.

In a chapter “Reclaiming Bengal”, Nandakumar goes on to allege that to ‘secularise’ the language, the Mamata government has removed all words from school textbooks which have a Hindu connection.

Sharing excerpts of the book, which has 25 chapters on subjects like “Hindutva and Democracy”, “Hindutva versus Nehruvian Secularism”, “Bharat’s True Destiny” and “The Dharma of Business”, Nandkumar told TOI, “I have made a humble attempt to analyse and see contemporary issues in the light of Hindutva paradigm.”

Kumar says certain “intellectuals” have problems with the term “Hindutva”, only because of an extraordinary hostility towards the faith. “Hindutva is nearest in meaning to Hinduness and it cannot be ‘Hinduism’. My contention is that ‘ism’ is a closed book of thought ... a rigid dogma,” he added. To explain “Hindutva”, the RSS functionary said, “Dr S Radhakrishnan defined Hinduism as not an end result but an open process. It is not a fixed revelation but an ever growing tradition, open to additions and adoptions, which is what I have analysed in the book.”

“The superficial similarity between Hindutva and Hinduism is responsible for this regrettable estrangement that, at times, alienates well-meaning people. The distinction between these two terms would be made clear...If there be really any word of alien growth, it is this word ‘Hindusim’,” Kumar starts the book quoting Hindutva icon Veer Savarkar’s “Essentials of Hindutva”.

HYDERABAD: The police has issued notices to the members of the anti-CAA joint action committee (JAC). Sleuths said that various police stations had issued notices to several youth under CrPC sections for allegedly violating the conditions of the police permission granted for the Million March on January 4.

Following the notices, police have started summoning those youths who have actively taken part in the Million March and whose names are said to be in more than twenty FIRs issued by various police stations across the city. In order to file charge-sheets in these cases, sleuths of Hyderabad police have started issuing notices to the accused under CRPC section 41(A).

In the FIRs, police alleged that Mushtaq Malik and his followers violated the conditions of joint commissioner of police (Central Zone) who had accorded permission for a protest on January 4 at Indira park Dharna Chowk. “Despite clear instructions of not permitting more than one thousand persons to take part in Million March, the followers of the JAC convenor took out rally by obstructing the free flow of traffic,” the FIR said.

To strengthen their position on the Miilion March cases, the names, vehicle numbers of those who had taken part in the march have been included in the FIRs. Even photographs and videos gathered by police during the march may be used as evidence when the accused are produced in court.

Alleging police harassment, a delegation of JAC on Thursday made a representation to the State Minorities Commission. “Police are exhibiting overzealous action...despite (the fact that the) march went on peacefully. They have booked several cases against youths and they are being summoned to the police station,” the JAC said in their statement.

Nagpur: Heavy unseasonal downpour accompanied with hail and chilly breeze on Thursday morning crippled normal life in many areas across the city.

Roads were flooded with knee-deep water and many areas reported streets carpeted with hail. Motorists found it difficult to wade through flooded streets. Waterlogging led to traffic snarls in many localities.

Mayor Sandip Joshi on Thursday visited City Operation Centre (COC) at NMC and took stock of the situation through CCTV cameras installed at various places in the city. The fire department also received complaints pertaining to rainwater entering many houses at Kapil Nagar in north Nagpur.

A tree was also uprooted in Mhalgi Nagar area. “The NMC’s fire department started the de-watering process in many areas,” said an official at NMC’s fire and emergency services control room.

Choked stormwater networks and overflowing nullahs spilled on to several major thoroughfares with knee-deep water, affecting vehicular traffic on many roads.

The busy Medical College road, Shatabdi Chowk to Beltarodi road and Dadiwala Layout in Jogi Nagar were affected due to rain.

Vehicles criss-crossing railway underbridges (RUBs) across the city faced hardships due to accumulated water on busy Narendra Nagar RUB, Mehdibagh RUB etc.

During his 10-minute stay at COC centre, Joshi observed water accumulation at Padole Square and he directed the officials from Laxmi Nagar zone and the fire department to de-water the busy square.

Traffic was affected in south, east and north Nagpur and there were heavy traffic jams on Narendra Nagar Ring Road due to waterlogging at the underbridge, traffic policemen told TOI.

Vehicular traffic passing through Mehdibagh RUB was also hit for almost two hours. It exposed the casual approach of the railway authorities to resolve waterlogging in this RUB, said local residents.

BHOPAL: Congress’s grassroots frontal organisation, Seva Dal, distributed controversial literature on Veer Savarkar in Bhopal on Wednesday even as RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat arrived in Indore to preside over a national meeting of the organisation.

A book titled “Veer Savarkar Kitne ‘Veer’?” was distributed among Seva Dal workers, who have gathered here from across the country for a 12-day training camp. Seva Dal national president Lalji Desai launched a scathing attack on RSS, calling it an “anti-national organization, since it does not respect either the country’s Constitution or the national flag”.

“When we distributed literature on Vinayak Damodar Savarkar , the intention was to tell our workers the truth about the freedom movement — that there is a huge difference between Congress’s patriotism and BJP’s ideology of polarising people. Our workers can, thereafter, take the message of Congress’s patriotism and sense of brotherhood to the common man,” Seva Dal state president Satyendra Yadav told TOI.

The literature distributed at the Seva Dal camp quotes books on Savarkar to call him “a person with communal mentality, which culminated in the Hindutva philosophy”. “During his last few years in jail, he (Savarkar) outlined his concept of Hindutva in the 1923 book ‘Essentials of Hindutva’, which in 1928 was re-printed as ‘Hindutva: Who is a Hindu?’ This ideology was meant to divide, which would divert attention of Hindus from the British and focus it on Muslims.” The book calls RSS a “communal organisation, loyal to the British”.

On NRC, according to MEA , the government has said that it’s a process mandated by the Supreme Court and that it should be seen as separate from CAA.

“We emphasised that CAA just expedites acquiring of citizenship to persecuted minorities. It does not change basic structure of the Constitution,” MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said at a media briefing.

He said that Indian missions had been asked to convey to the local governments that the Act provides expedited consideration for Indian citizenship to persecuted minorities. Without mentioning Muslims, even other citizens, he said, had “existing avenues’’ to explore for citizenship.

Nagpur: Even as there is no direct or indirect evidence of leopard presence in Ambazari reserve forest , the MahaMetro has shut the door on morning walkers at Little Wood , the forest land in its possession.

Hundreds of nature lovers and morning walkers residing on Hingna Road visit the Little Wood daily to exercise and walk on the 3.5km nature trail. The nature trail is closed since December 7 after a labourer sighted a leopard in the forest.

Presence of a leopard in the biodiversity park with indirect evidence like pug marks was first reported by visitors on November 28. The park was closed for visitors from November 29.

On December 6, forest department found direct evidence of the leopard with a wild boar kill. Since then the park remained closed till December 18. As no further evidence was found, the biodiversity park was reopened from December 19.

Even as forest department, which has more responsibility towards visitors visiting the park, has opened the area, MahaMetro has not removed the board on its gate that states that the park is closed due to leopard presence the area.

MahaMetro spokesperson Akhilesh Halve said, “Though a notice of caution has been displayed at the gate, we have officially not closed Little Wood and people are being allowed.” But visitors complained they were being turned down by the guards.

P Kalyan Kumar, chief conservator of forests (CCF), Nagpur, said, “We have scanned the entire forest area and there is no evidence of leopard as of now. There is no point in avoiding morning walkers. We need to connect with the communities to sensitize them about nature.”

56,['3/01/2020'],Hyderabad preferred destination for multi-crore education deals,"Representative image

HYDERABAD: Home to a string of international schools, Hyderabad is fast becoming India’s preferred destination for mega multi-crore investments in education. Between 2018 and 2019, three of the top four marquee deals signed in the country, came Hyderabad’s way – the ticket size ranging anywhere between Rs 700 crore and Rs 2,000 crore. Collectively, India saw about $1 billion being pumped into its education sector last year, say highly-placed industry sources.This trend of private equity (PE) investments in schools is expected to continue through 2020 with analysts predicting another $1 billion coming India’s way. In fact, many say the country’s educational sector has the potential to attract up to $4-5 billion.Up for grabs in 2020 are at least three large school chains from Hyderabad, Mumbai and Chennai apart from several smaller institutions across the country. “While 2019 was about a few big deals, 2020 will see at least half a dozen small deals worth Rs 250 crore to Rs 500 crore,” said an investor, attributing this sudden rush of PE funds to the landmark KKR-EuroKids deal, signed in August last year.Global PE giant KKR acquired the preschool chain, EuroKids, reportedly for Rs 2,000 crore, making for the biggest headlines in the K-12 (kindergarten to class 12) sector. Many heads turned even when Hong Kong-based Nord Anglia Education acquired one of Hyderabad’s most prominent private school chains, Oakridge International Schools, in February. The deal was closed for Rs 1,600 crore. Later in November, another major investment was reported from the city when Cognita, a private schools group headquartered in Finland, made a foray into India with Chirec International, for a supposed Rs 700 crore.While news of Sri Chaitanya Schools, another major Hyderabad-based player in the K-12 sector, being bought by PE investors Brookfield and Kalpathi Investments did the rounds in October, sources say, the parties are yet to sign on the dotted line.Once done, it could well stand out as the biggest transaction in India, so far.Earlier in 2018, Chaitanya’s competitor Narayana attracted about Rs 500 crore from Morgan Stanley’s PE arm, Banyan Tree Capital.But what’s driving this trend? Experts attribute it to India’s large private school-going populace which, at 150 million, is the highest in the world. “Rapid urbanisation coupled with the largest school going population in the world will ensure that the education sector continues to be interesting for global investors,” said Jasmeet Chhabra, managing partner of Cerestra, a leading edu-infra firm. He added: “Given the large base of professional workforce in cities like Hyderabad, it would be safe to say that bulk of this interest will be centered here and in other cities like Bengaluru and Pune.” The firm has investments to the tune of Rs 1,200 crore across all major metros and is expected to double its portfolio in 2020.Allaying fears of parents about this trend making quality private education a fiefdom of the rich, experts said that it will, on the contrary, improve standards across the sector.“As has been the case so far, there will not be any hike in school fee. What we can expect are: better quality of teachers because of improved salaries and more school chains that follow standardised practices,” said a source privy to some big deals brokered in 2019.The source added: “The practice that has started from Hyderabad will gradually move into all big cities, and some tier 2 cities too over the next few years.”",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73063744,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-357381,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-preferred-destination-for-multi-crore-edu-deals/articleshow/73062408.cms

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had demanded compensation of Rs 25,000 per hectare for farmers whose crops had been damaged due to unseasonal rains in October.”

“Leaders of Congress and NCP had demanded Rs 50,000 per hectare. However, after coming to power, the government did not increase the relief beyond that granted by the governor,” he said.

Turning to crop loan waiver scheme of the state government, he said, “Our government had waived loans taken between 2001 and 2017. MVA has waived loans taken after that, which means only a period of two years has been considered. They have put the cut-off date at September 2019 so that farmers who had taken loans in October 2019 due to crop damage do not get any benefit. MVA leaders had promised to waive off entire crop loan but now they have inserted a condition that farmers whose loan exceeds Rs 2 lakh will not be eligible for waiver. The government is anti-farmer.”

Slamming Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP leaders for squabbling over portfolios, Fadnavis said, “The ministers are lobbying for ‘plum’ portfolios but nobody wants agriculture. This shows how their love for farmers is not sincere.”

Recounting the steps taken by the BJP government for farmers, he said they beneftted greatly from Shetkari Sanman Nidhi. “Former energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule had sanctioned a large number of agricultural pump connections but did not disconnect even a single farmer for non-payment of bills. Our government worked for long-term upliftment of farmers.”

The BJP neta also held a meeting of party workers at Amdi Phata and Dhanala. He then attended the inauguration of new campus of National Fire Service College at hands of Union home minister Amit Shah. In the evening, he addressed a public meeting at Digdoh and held a party meeting. His public meeting at Besa was cancelled due to some reason.

59,['3/01/2020'],Ryots staring at fresh crop losses due to unseasonal rain,"This story is from January 3, 2020

Nagpur: Unseasonal rain at the beginning of new year is expected to bring another bout of losses for farmers. Even as confirmed reports are yet to reach, the agriculture department is compiling data from its field-level offices throughout the region.

Cotton, a kharif crop and the mainstay of Vidarbha’s farmers that has still not been entirely harvested, is expected to be hit. Rabi crops like chana (gram) and wheat, which are in germination stage at present, are also likely to be affected with losses to orange growers not being ruled out too.

Officials from the agriculture department said that it may be too early to predict the extent of losses. Some of the farmers TOI spoke to also ruled out of losses being severe at this stage but there were conflicting versions too.

The region’s kharif crops that are harvested between October to January include cotton, soyabean, tur and paddy. Even as soyabean has been harvested, one more round of picking remains for cotton. The remaining bolls are expected to be hit due to the rains, especially if there has been a hailstorm in the area, said a source in the state’s agriculture department.

The rabi crops that are harvested in March are chana and wheat, said sources. The crops may be damaged if the rain water remains stagnated in the fields.

Paddy that has been left in the fields after harvest may be damaged too, thus bringing down its prices. Vishal Barbate, a paddy grower at Ramtek, said that some of the farmers may have still left the paddy crop in the farms to dry. The stacking is done after the crop is dried.

Tur that is harvested in this month is likely to be the most vulnerable. Gajanan Singawar from Yavatmal said that even as he has entirely harvested soyabean, tur remains in the farms. “The crops that are in flowering stage are likely to be completely damaged due to the rains,” he said.

Family members and relatives of their infant children wait outside the JK Lone hospital, Kota (PTI)

NEW DELHI: Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Thursday expressed concern over infant deaths in a Kota hospital in Rajasthan as political sparring mounted over the issue and rivals accused the opposition party of maintaining silence over the development in the party-ruled state. Over 100 infants died in December in JK Lon hospital.

Sonia Gandhi summoned AICC general secretary in-charge of Rajasthan Avinash Pande for a discussion on Thursday. “She wanted to know the reasons of the deaths. It is a very sad situation and the CM has been asked to act on the report. The BJP allegation (of Congress government’s insensitivity) is untrue as the inquiry is on and those responsible will be punished,” Pande said after meeting Sonia.

In a series of tweets, Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath said, “The death of 100 innocent children is extremely saddening and heart-wrenching. It is extremely sad that Congress president Sonia Gandhi and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, despite being women, are not able to understand the sorrow of the mothers.”

He added it would have been better “had Priyanka met and consoled the aggrieved mothers instead of indulging in politics in UP”. Priyanka was recently on a tour to UP where she attacked BJP and the UP government over the Citizenship Amendment Act and police firing during protests, and also visited relatives of the victims.

Calling CM Ashok Gehlot as “insensitive, disinterested and irresponsible”, Mayawati said, “But, what is more saddening is the fact that the top leadership of Congress, especially its general secretary, are maintaining silence over this issue. It would have been better that like she did in UP, she had met the aggrieved mothers, who lost their children due to the laxity of the party’s government.”

“There should be no politics over the issue. Infant mortality at this hospital is steadily decreasing,” said Gehlot.

As per target fixed, consignments of imported onion have started arriving from 15 December onwards and approx 42500… https://t.co/rczahKkqoi — Ram Vilas Paswan (@irvpaswan) 1577713870000

NEW DELHI: In less than a month, the government is staring at problem of plenty as states appear reluctant to lift imported onions with the arrival of a fresh crop beginning to cool prices. On Thursday, the onion price in Lasalgaon, the country’s largest wholesale onion market, was Rs 3,500 per quintal as against a record-high of Rs 8,600 last month.The high prices across most cities might wane with arrival of more kharif crops in mandis. The fresh harvest would not only moderate prices but also seems to be reducing states’ interest to lift imported onion from the central buffer. The Centre has contracted import of about 45,000 tonnes, of which over 5,000 tonnes have already arrived. Though there was a plan to import one lakh tonnes of the kitchen staple, it has been put on hold. “First we have to dispose of the quantity that has arrived and shipment that are on the way. Some states are taking imported onion, but that’s much less than what they had indicated to check prices,” said an official.The concern is also evident from a recent tweet by consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan . “As per target fixed, consignments of imported onion have started arriving from December 15 onwards and approx 42,500 tonnes of onion stock is available. I request state governments to send their demand to department of consumer affairs and NAFED to augment onion supply,” he tweeted.Sources said that even in the retail market there are few takers of imported onions as it lacks the pungency or taste Indian consumers like. The government is now planning to increase the buffer stock of domestic onion this year.TOI has learnt that the issue of states lifting less imported onion was also discussed in a meeting of Group of Ministers headed by home minister Amit Shah .Officials said that the states will have to help dispose of the onion stock to avoid “losses” as the perishable item cannot be stored for long. Earlier, the government had said that there was about 50% “loss” to the 57,000 tonnes of onion it had stored this year after procuring directly from farmers.Sources said the abnormal price in the past couple of months was due to short supply and delay in arrival of fresh crop and effect of flooding in some parts, which triggered the need to import. But the situation is improving very quickly as arrival of fresh crop has picked up. “There is significant price correction across markets. The situation will improve and prices in retail market will fall soon,” said an official.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73077248,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-736313,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/states-eye-fresh-harvest-cold-to-imported-onions/articleshow/73077244.cms
62,['3/01/2020'],DMK ahead of ruling ADMK in rural body polls,"This story is from January 3, 2020

CHENNAI: The rural local body elections in Tamil Nadu , held after a gap of eight years, the first after the demise of M Karunanidhi and J Jayalalithaa , have turned out to be in favour of DMK as the party registered big wins across the state. The results, declared till Thursday night, indicated a setback for the governing AIADMK.

While DMK held a clear lead in the morning, AIADMK caught up and managed to surge ahead in several places later. Towards the end of the day, when counting was still incomplete in many places, DMK managed to retain more number of district councillor posts as well as panchayat union councillor posts. It was a close contest and AIADMK was not far behind. The results are likely to be officially declared on Friday.

The day was marked by complaints from opposition parties as well as government staff deployed for poll duty. At a counting centre at Dharmapuri , DMK cadres complained that CCTV cameras were not functioning. In Karur, they objected to the alleged presence of AIADMK men at counting centres. The government staff, meanwhile, complained of delay in providing food to them. CM Edappadi K Palaniswami went into a huddle with party functionaries as the results showed DMK ahead. DMK president M K Stalin, on the other hand, upped the ante and complained to the SEC, alleging that the party in government was scheming to scuttle DMK’s victory with the help of officials.

Celebrations broke out as the results started to come in, spreading cheer in the DMK camp. Poll watchers did not rule out a change in the trend by Friday. Ceding of so many seats to the opposition party, however, is seen as a blow to AIADMK. “It is a definite setback for AIADMK, which is known for its rural vote bank,” said political analyst Tharasu Shyam.

Balyan with his wife Shivani, a UP police constable. The two had got married last February.

Fireman goes down fighting as blaze spirals out of control after explosions

Building was more than 40 years old, stuffed with batteries, chemicals and plastic

NEW DELHI: One fireman died while 14 others had a narrow escape when a part of the factory-cum-outlet of a wellknown battery manufacturing firm where they were battling a major blaze collapsed following a series of sudden explosions in west Delhi’s Peeragarhi on Thursday.Fireman Amit Balyan, who had joined the department last year and got married recently, was buried under a pile of debris following the explosions triggered by a compressor burst. He died due to excessive bleeding and smoke inhalation. It took firemen five hours to pull his body out of the debris.The fire, which started at the basement around 4am, was brought under control after an intense, 12-hour-long operation. Firemen said the blaze had initially been controlled but suddenly the compressor unit, used to fill acid in the batteries, exploded in the basement. This caused a chain of blasts in batteries at the factories due to which the rear portion of the building capsized on the firemen who were dousing the flames.Balyan’s father, Babu Ram, is an assistant sub-inspector with Delhi Police. His wife, Shivani, is a UP police constable posted in Ghaziabad. They had married in February last year after a brief love affair.Balyan, along with his colleagues Mahavir and Manjeet Rana, was buried under the debris after the blasts while 12 other firemen and three caretakers of the factory were either hit by falling concrete slabs or had lucky escapes as the slab fell around them. One of the caretakers, Brijender Kashyap, had to be admitted to the hospital for treatment.The fire department rushed seven fire tenders to douse the flames. However, as the fire got out of control after the explosions, 69 fire tenders along with 500 firemen were pressed into the service. Three of the firemen including Balyan were completely buried under the concrete while the rest suffered injuries in the 3,000-sq-foot basement. Firemen say that the factory was stuffed with batteries and chemicals that made their rescue operation tedious and risky.The building is located at Udyog Nagar Industrial Area of Peeragarhi. Fire officials said they could reach the scene within minutes as the factory is located just a stone’s throw away from the area fire station. “The whole structure of the building had weakened and it started collapsing. We could not use cranes for the rescue operation as the building would have collapsed further, causing more injuries. We had to remove the debris using our hands. The fire-fighting operation too had to be conducted in tandem,” said Atul Garg, Director, DFS.The fire department informed the NDRF about the incident who had to cut open the concrete to rescue the trapped firemen.Fire officials said the building was more than 40 years old and was stuffed with chemicals and plastic emitting toxic fumes, which made fire-fighting operation difficult. It was found that the building neither had an NOC from the fire department nor had any fire-fighting equipment installed.Munna Lal, a worker at a factory behind the building, said, “I came for work around 8.30am and the flames could be seen coming through the grills. The firemen were trying to douse the flames and suddenly there were three blasts. Even our building shook when it happened. There was dust and smoke all around and we could hear people scream about firemen and a worker getting stuck under the debris.”Fire officers say that their major challenge was to rescue Balyan who was stuck under the heaviest pile of debris. Initially the fire officials could see his hand and even tried to send oxygen supply to him. However, the heat and the heavy concrete slabs which had to be moved with hands made it difficult. Balyan was pulled out by 2.15pm and was declared “brought dead” at the hospital.Investigations have revealed that the factory was registered in the name of Anil Gupta. “We have registered a case of causing death due to negligence with respect to fire or combustible matter, causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others and death due to negligence,” a police officer said. Police are probing whether the owners had the permission to store such large amount of acid and combustible material.Fire officials say that the blaze was completely doused around 6pm but cooling operations went on till late at night as the fire fighters had to be cautious about the building collapsing again.BJP MP Manoj Tiwari and health minister Satyendar Jain visited the spot to take account of the situation. LG Baijal also visited the hospital to meet the injured.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73077282,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-436827,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/firefighter-dies-battling-blaze-in-battery-factory-17-rescued/articleshow/73077270.cms

The seized gold bars have an estimated value of Rs 1.4 crore.

NEW DELHI: On the first day of 2020, customs officials at Indira Gandhi International (IGI) airport made seizures worth over a few crores in six different cases. As many as 11 people were arrested.

The biggest catch was that of gold bars weighing 4 kg, which has an estimated value of up to Rs 1.4 crore. The gold, to the officials’ surprise, was lying unclaimed under the passenger seat of a flight coming from Muscat.

In another case, customs officials seized red sanders weighing 127 kg and valued at Rs 12.70 lakh from three passengers who were planning to depart to Hong Kong. All three men were arrested.

On Wednesday itself, another man was caught with seven gold bars weighing 2.6 kg, which was valued at Rs 88 lakh. He had arrived from Bahrain and was arrested after he admitted that he had also smuggled gold worth over Rs 2 crore in the past.

In the fourth case, four Afghani men were caught with four gold chains weighing 1,499 grams. They had come from Sharjah with gold worth over Rs 50 lakh. Upon their arrest, they said that they had been involved in smuggling gold into Delhi in the past.

In the last seizure of the day, officials seized two cylindrical pieces of gold weighing 646 grams worth Rs 22 lakh from a mother-son duo. They had come to Delhi from Bangkok. They have been arrested. The duo have also confessed to their prior involvement in smuggling cases over the past few months, the officials said.

In the last incident of the day, the team seized a gold chain weighing 969 grams valued at Rs 33 lakh from a Turkmenistan woman. She admitted to having smuggled gold during her past visits as well.

NEW DELHI: December brought some good fortune for the liquor industry, with Delhiites gulping down alcohol worth almost Rs 1,000 crore, sources said.While the actual data on the number of bottles sold through vends and hotels and bars during the month is still being compiled, a source said the amount had been calculated on the basis of the revenue the excise department earned as duty paid on liquor bottles.According to sources, the excise department earned Rs 465 crore as duty on liquor in the month of December in comparison with Rs 460 crore earned in the last month of 2018, showing an insignificant increase of just about 1%.“This amount is calculated on the basis of liquor supplied to the vends, hotels and bars,” said an excise department official, requesting anonymity.Delhi has a network of 864 liquor vends — government-run and private — while 951 hotels, bars and clubs have the licence to serve alcohol to customers.Interestingly, Delhi witnessed a record sale of liquor in December 2019, which was the second-coldest month ever since 1901.Sources said the excise department’s decision to slash the prices of a few popular brands of imported liquor contributed the increase in its earnings. The excise department in November last reduced prices of about 10 brands of foreign liquor by 20-25%.“The sale of these brands witnessed a surge of about three times after the prices were revised. Earlier, people used to buy foreign liquor from neighbouring Haryana due to a price difference of Rs800-1200 per bottle and smuggle it to Delhi. With reduced prices, the difference in the rate is not much, which made Delhi customers buy these brands locally,” said an official.Another source said that the department’s earnings would have been even more, had the government not shut down 120 departmental store that sold wine and beer in the third week of December after complaints of irregularities.In Video: Delhiites spent Rs 1,000 crore on liquor last December",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73077924,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-813598,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhiites-spent-rs-1000-crore-on-liquor-last-december/articleshow/73077352.cms

It all started when Chiru spoke about how all members of the association must work together as one family and sort out all issues between them. An irked Rajasekhar immediately took the mic and went on a rant about how there’s an attempt to showcase the industry as one big, happy family when all is not well in the association.“Ever since I took over as Vice-President of MAA, I’ve been tirelessly working towards the progress of the association and the artistes. So much so that I have not even done a single film since. Chiranjeevi says we should sort things out as one family and move forward. However, when you light a fire, you cannot expect smoke to not be there. Every family will have problems but you can’t pretend we’re all happy to the outside world. What’s wrong in accepting that there are problems? We act like heroes on screen, but when someone is trying to act like a hero in real life, their voices are being throttled. What kind of industry is this?”, Rajasekhar fumed.An infuriated Chiru slammed Rajasekhar for his behaviour and called for disciplinary action to be taken against him. “If you have something nice to say, please say it out loud. If not, have a meaningful discussion. When there are elders, one must speak with respect. Why should all of us stay here and be humiliated like this? How embarrassing is it for someone to show the industry in a bad light to the outside world?,” asked an enraged Chiru. “I strongly condemn his actions. When all of us were partaking in a sensible discussion, to aggressively snatch a mic, without following protocol or showing any respect to others is despicable. I don’t understand such behaviour,” he added. Veteran actor and former MAA President Mohan Babu also sparred with Rajasekhar, but was told to calm to down by Chiranjeevi.

70,['3/01/2020'],Delhi looking skyward to solve its parking puzzle,"Delhi’s first tower parking at Green Park

NEW DELHI: The city got its first tower parking on Thursday when Union urban affairs minister Hardeep Puri inaugurated the modern facility on Aurobindo Marg at Green Park . The 17-storey prefabricated steel structure with automated vehicle placement lifts is touted as the model solution to the parking woes in the spacestarved capital. Puri confirmed this when he remarked, “The public-private partnership model, with the government providing gap viability funds, can be the way forward. My ministry will provide full support to such projects.”While only two 39.5-metre towers were inaugurated on Thursday, SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti assured that all four towers would become operational within a month. There would be added facilities like toilets, baby sitting room and waiting rooms for drivers.The foundation stone of the parking was laid in March last year. Mayor Sunita Kangra said that despite financial crunch in SDMC, it was able to execute the project in nine months. “Inaugurating these two towers is an achievement, given shortages in our budget,” Kangra said.Delhi has more than 75 lakh active vehicles, but the municipal corporations have space to accommodate just 94,000 vehicles in 434 surface, stack and multilevel parking facilities. That is why optimum use of space was so important. The Green Park facility offers fully automated parking within a small space of 236 sq metres. The structure can hold 136 vehicles in the four towers. While the first to fourth floors have been designed to park 32 SUVs or big vehicles, the fifth to seventeenth floors can hold 104 sedans, an SDMC official said.The two towers now operational have space for 68 cars. “Tower parking requires a 1.5-sq metre space to park a car compared with 30 sq m necessary in conventional parking,” explained Bharti. He said that four other automated parking lots are being developed in south Delhi. While those at Adhchini and Lajpat Nagar will be completed in another four months, bids have been invited for similar structures at New Friends Colony and Nizamuddin. Some residents have, however, expressed concern that high-rise steel structures like these would affect the aesthetics of the capital’s skyline.Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, present at the inauguration, said that when he assumed office, he realised parking and traffic management were among the biggest problems faced by Delhi. “These prefabricated parking lots are easier to set up as well as more user friendly than the brick-mortar parkings,” Baijal said. He asked SDMC and the traffic police to ensure that all roadside parking was now curbed. “When traffic flow is smooth, the pollution level also goes down,” he added.According to an SDMC official, a car would first be parked on the robotic arm by an attendant. Capable of 360-degree swivelling, the arm would pick up the vehicle and place it on a platform to be taken up by a lift to an empty slot on any of the 17 floors. It can be recalled by pressing the car number on the input screen on the ground floor. The retrieval time for a vehicle will be three minutes.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73077364,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-356884,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-looking-skyward-to-solve-its-parking-puzzle/articleshow/73077359.cms

NEW DELHI: Rescuing the 14 firemen trapped in debris was one of the most challenging operations for Delhi Fire Service and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). Not only was there a fear of inhaling harmful acid fumes, but the building had also become extremely unstable. A complete collapse would have led to further loss of life.The rescuers adopted the three-pronged approach of extinguishing, cutting and rescuing the trapped firemen at the same time. Parts of the building collapsed thrice during the firefighting that had been on since morning.When the firemen reached the building located in D-Block of Udyog Nagar and started dousing the blaze, little did they know that parts of it would soon collapse on them.Sanjay Tomar, deputy chief fire officer, said, “The firemen were standing in the circulating space. A compressor in the basement blasted and debris fell on the firefighters. While some men in the basement were rescued safely, those on the sides were stuck by debris. The leg of Mahavir, one of the firemen, got stuck under the debris, but we managed to pull him out.”The firefighters said that the biggest challenge for them was lack of space. The building was located at the edge of a drain, which didn’t give the firemen enough space to bring in an earthmover. Moreover, the molten batteries kept in the basement had turned into a pool of burning plastic and chemicals and were emitting toxic smoke.“The firemen trapped under the debris and the ones rescuing them had to be supplied with fresh air otherwise they would have fallen unconscious,” said a fire officer.Officials said they had to break down one of the walls of an adjacent building using an earthmover to gain access to the portion that had collapsed. Firemen wove the end of a rope into a chair-like shape to lift out the injured. To ensure that there were no further injuries to the rescuers, grilles and ladders were used to enter the premises from the adjoining buildings.Senior officers present at the spot said another major challenge faced by them was raw acid flowing out of the storage area. “We had to ensure that our suits didn’t get burnt by the chemical. We had to work slowly into the building spraying foam and water,” said a fire officer.To gain access to the building, the firemen used lifts to reach the facade and break open the glass panes. This allowed the toxic fumes to leave the building and gave access to the hosepipes of the fire tenders. An inquiry is being conducted to find out whether there were any violations in the construction of the building as there was little space left for manoeuvring.In Video: One firefighter dead, several injured in Delhi's Peeragarhi fire",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73077383,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-478305,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/peeragarhi-fire-unstable-building-toxic-fumes-made-rescue-operations-tough/articleshow/73077373.cms

Representative image

MUMBAI: Police on Wednesday arrested the caretaker of a private educational institution who, along with a few others, allegedly fabricated documents and forged signatures of the owner and transferred his property worth Rs 3.5 crore.

The Economic Offences Wing seized fabricated documents from Ashok Kumar Singh, 52. Police said they were looking for his accomplices. The nearly two-acre property owned by Johnson Iruddhaya is at Rajdeep Nagar Society in Bhandup (W). Police said Iruddhaya set up Bhandup Village Citizen Education Society and got it registered with the charity commissioner. In 2012, he started a school, Mary John English School, for the underprivileged. Iruddhaya later shifted to Chennai and appointed Singh as caretaker.

“Recently, the complainant learnt Singh had submitted bogus documents before the charity commissioner, forged his signature and declared him the trustee of both the Bhandup Village Citizen Education Society and Mary John English School and transferred the property in his name,” said an officer. Police carried out a search of Singh’s house and found documents pertaining to the property.

MUMBAI: A 40-year-old woman, who was reportedly depressed after losing her job, jumped to her death from the terrace of an eight-storey building in Kandivli (west) on Thursday evening. A passerby tried to catch her and ended up dislocating his arm.

The woman, Dimple Wadilal, stayed with her mother and brother in Rock Avenue building on the eighth floor.

The incident occurred around 5.30pm when Dimple walked to the terrace and climbed on to the the parapet. Passersby noticed her and asked her to step back. Charkop police probing the case said a man dislocated his shoulder while trying to catch her.

Police said Wadilal worked in a private firm. Her brother is a cabin crew with a private airline and is currently out of the country. “We are not sure if she has left a suicide note. The mother told us that she was depressed,’’ said Charkop police senior inspector Vitthal Shinde.

The woman was breathing after the fall and was rushed to the hospital where she was declared brought dead. “The mother was in their flat when the incident occurred,” said a police officer on condition of anonymity.

Police said they are waiting for the Wadilal’s mother to recover from the shock before asking further questions. A case of accidental death report has been registered.

102,['3/01/2020'],Navi Mumbai: Man booked for giving triple talaq over Rs 10 lakh dowry,"This story is from January 3, 2020

Representative image

NAVI MUMBAI: A 28-year-old woman has lodged a police complaint alleging that her husband had given her a talaq notice and later instant divorce by uttering ‘talaq’ thrice at his Vashi residence last month. She also alleged that her husband and three in laws harassed her for Rs 10 lakh dowry.

It is the fourth case under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, in Mumbai metropolitan region, and the second in Navi Mumbai.

“The woman had initially lodged a complaint with Ambernath police on December 14, as she had moved back with her parents. On December 31, the case was transferred to Vashi police station as she alleged that her husband, aged 30, had given her triple talaq at his Vashi home,” said senior inspector Sanjeev Dhumal of Vashi police station. “After recording her statement, we will summon the four accused to ascertain whether her husband had uttered ‘talaq’ thrice.”

In her statement to Ambernath police, the woman said soon after their marriage in June 2014, her husband, his mother, brother and sister started abusing and assaulting her, and demanded dowry. Dhumal said, “She alleged that her husband demanded that she get Rs 10 lakh from her parents or leave his house with her child. She said last month her husband gave her a divorce notice and uttered ‘talaq’ thrice. Even after counselling, her husband and in-laws were reluctant to take her back, so she approached the police.”

The husband, his mother, brother and sister have been booked under Section 4 of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, along with IPC sections 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation).

Three such cases were registered in 2019. On August 1, Thane police had booked a Mumbra resident who had given triple talaq to his wife via WhatsApp on November 30, 2018. In the second case, Nagpada police booked a 39-yearold man for giving instant talaq to his dietician wife in November 2018. In the third case registered at Kharghar police station in November 2019, a 20-year-old TYBCom student claimed that her 28-year-old husband had divorced her by uttering ‘talaq’ thrice at his Kurla home in May.

Villagers, school children and even forest department employees from around 100 villages have been trained to ... Read More

VADODARA: Mushrooms may be considered gourmet, but in central Gujarat 's tribal belt, this is becoming a staple in many kitchens.

Thanks to the efforts by a city-based activist who introduced mushrooms to the tribal people in around 100 villages on an experimental basis, some farmers have not only warmed up to the new-found fungiculture, but are also consuming the exotic product.

Considering malnutrition - the biggest problem in tribal areas of the state - activist Anil Satapathy trained these rustic tillers on how to grow mushrooms besides teaching them how to cook and eat them too. The nutritious food item is being cooked as in organised community events to encourage more acceptance and consumption.

Satapathy, who leads the Rural Institute for Stimulating Tribal Areas (RISTA), said that mushrooms are rich in nutrition and can be grown easily in mediums like paddy straw, grass, cotton crop waste and other material. ""If one grows different varieties of mushrooms, one can cultivate them throughout the year,"" he explained.

The Savli Technology and Business Incubator by the Gujarat State Biotechnology Mission has provided the activist space where he prepares the spawns for paddy straw, oyster and milky mushrooms and supplies them to villagers.

The activist said he has demonstrated the technique to villagers, school children and even forest department employees from around 100 villages in Dahod, Panchmahal, Chhota Udepur, Narmada and Vadodara districts so far.

106,['3/01/2020'],Karnataka’s Jammu and Kashmir luxury hotel plan hits snag,"This story is from January 3, 2020

Karnataka tourism minister CT Ravi

BENGALURU: Three months after it was mooted, the Karnataka government’s ambitious proposal to run a luxury hotel in Jammu & Kashmir has failed to take off due to technical reasons that include the absence of internet and mobile services in J&K and the change in the status of J&K from a state to Union Territory.

The state government had proposed a luxury hotel in J&K soon after the Centre revoked special status to the state in September last year. Tourism minister CT Ravi had written to then J&K governor Satyapal Malik and outlined the state government’s intent.

Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation (KSTDC) was to run the hotel. Speaking to TOI, KSTDC MD Kumar Pushkar said the government plans to buy 10 to 15 acres of land in J&K.

“We want to facilitate Karnataka tourists who frequent J&K for religious events like the Amarnath Yatra,” Pushkar said. “More than commercial viability, we are looking at a property to serve citizens. However, we are yet to hear from the J&K administration.”

Officials said the communication blockade had hampered efforts. “We were unable to reach officials to know the status of our proposal. This included the governor’s office,” said a senior official.

However, Pushkar said he managed to get in touch with the director of tourism for J&K a few days ago and there has been some development on the proposal. “If required, a team from Karnataka will visit J&K for further negotiation,” Pushkar said.

The other major problem was the change in the status of J&K. “The minister’s first letter was addressed to the state government of J&K. Now, they are changing it to a UT and they have asked for a fresh process.”

“The J&K governor had in fact given me an appointment in this regard on December 20, but due to anti-CAA protests, the meet was cancelled,” Ravi said.

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: A man, pretending to be a woman on social media, would convince men to share naked pictures of themselves with him and then blackmail them. A 29-year-old city-based man fell into this trap and coughed up Rs 46,010 through cash, e-wallets and gift vouchers. He finally had enough and lodged a complaint with city cyber cell.

DCP cyber cell Rajdeepsinh Jhala said this is the first such case they have encountered in which a man was blackmailed by a man who posed as a woman on social media.

""We have registered an offence under Section 384 of the IPC for extortion along with Sections 66-C and 67 of the IT Act. We have asked internet service providers for the IP address of the device through which at least four fake IDs of women were created to ensnare men,"" added Jhala.

According to the FIR lodged by the complainant, when he was doing his MCA in 2011, he came across a social media ID ostensibly belonging to a woman. They began chatting regularly. After a while, the person on the other end propositioned the man and then asked for nude photos of him, which the complaint sent to the ID.

The FIR states that the 29-year-old man soon started receiving extortion messages on social media, saying that if he did not pay up, his nude pictures would be sent to his mother and sister. The complainant was shocked to learn that the ID to which he sent his nude pictures was being run by a man and not a woman.

""Afraid of the consequences, the complainant first deposited Rs 15,000 into the bank account specified by the person behind the fake ID. The complainant deactivated his social media ID after that,"" said a senior cyber cell official.

Representative image

BENGALURU: Wracked with guilt over having given away her 53-day-old boy through illegal adoption after finding it difficult to raise him, a 35-year-old assistant professor knocked on the doors of police, pleading that she be reunited with her child.

Police managed to rescue the infant from a Mysuru couple on Thursday and handed him over to the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) in Bengaluru. The birth parents and the man who led them to the Mysuru couple were charged with selling the baby.

Banashankari residents Raksha (name changed) and Suresh (name changed), engineer with a private company, were blessed with a boy on October 23. With no one else to take care of the child, the couple employed domestic helps. But with the workers quitting one by one, the couple struggled to focus at work.

Upset, the couple decided to give away the child to someone in need. They came across a man, Shiv Raj (name changed), who assured them he would solve their problem. Raksha insisted the adoptive parents are childless, educated and financially stable.

On December 13, Shiv phoned the couple and said he had found the right adoptive parents. Around 5pm on December 16, Raksha and Suresh handed over their son to a man, his wife and another senior citizen — who had come in two cars — near Janata Bazaar, Banashankari III Stage. The trio said they would take good care of the child but the couple shouldn’t seek their whereabouts.

After returning home, Raksha began to suffer from guilt pangs. The couple called Shiv on phone, who said he was not aware of the child’s whereabouts. She repeatedly called him but he said he was only a middleman and asked her to file a police complaint.

On Tuesday, Raksha approached CK Achukattu police and filed a complaint. Admitting that she had committed a mistake, she requested cops to trace her child. Incidentally, hers was the last FIR to be booked by city police in 2019.

“Raksha and Suresh are professionals and couldn’t devote enough time to the child. It appears there was no money involved. We have booked the couple and Shiv under sections 80 (any person or organisation offers/gives/receives child without following adoption procedures), 81 (any person who sell/buys child) and 87 (abetment) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. We are probing all angles,” a police officer said.

“Raksha keeps changing her statement. All those involved will have to appear before the CWC,” the officer added.

Representative image

RAJKOT: Tact wins where might fails — a proverb that cops successfully employed while stepping into Jangleshwar locality, notoroius as the gambling hub of the city. What really challenges the authorities here are the the myriad of labyrinthine lanes criss-crossing the locality that makes a raid almost impossible task.

However, cops handle the odds smartly this time and nabbed 14 gamblers, some of them with criminal history, on Thursday.

On almost every previous raid, gamblers disappeared in to these alleys even before cops could enter the forbidden territory.

Informers would be posted at all vantage points in the hub that kingpins ruled who would keep them posted on all movements. At the slightest hint of trouble, dens would immediately shut down and gamblers disappear from the scene.

But on Thursday, policemen knew exactly how to play the same game, but cop style. They formed three teams of nine personnel dressed up as weather-beaten labourers.

“Each team consisted of three officers We had a google map of the the gambling den which we fed into our team members’ cellphones. All the teams were instructed to reach the target separately, so as not to attract unnecessary suspicion,” said V K Gadhvi, inspector with Bhaktinagar police station.

While one team went by Nadoda Nagar route, the other two teams crossed Aji River. Cops in mufti also used autorickshaws and cycles instead of police vehicles.

“When we reached our target — the house of Bashir Jesani (38) — we heard the gamblers shouting inside. We broke open the rear and the front doors of the house simultaneously and entered. All the 14 gamblers didn’t have the time or the escape route to flee and were caught,” narrated Gadhvi.

The police recovered Rs 2.58 lakh cash, dices, 15 cellphones, two two-wheelers, one SUV and one car from the accused.

Those arrested included Jesani, Tanvir Shishangia (38), Jahid Parekh (30), Rafiq Thariyani (34), Bhupat Basia (49), Shabir Kalar (36), Vasim Baloch (25), Rafiq Lakhani (40), Mansukh Kachhathiya (35) and Mahaveersinh Jadeja (30). They all are history-sheeters having been booked in different crimes in the past.

Water-logging near Durgam Cheruvu following Thursday’s rain.

HYDERABAD: The city experienced its second wettest day in January after 1922 by receiving an average rainfall of 36.8 mm up to 8.30 pm. As per to the India Meteorological Department figures, the city received highest rainfall of 93.2 mm on January 3, 1922.

Meteorologists said thunderstorm activity was likely to continue till January 4 following which it would subside making way for cold wave conditions. “The minimum temperature is expected to increase in parts of Telangana by 2-3 degrees celsius in the coming days, while maximums will subside due to rains and cloud cover.

From January 4, weather activities will start to clear up and minimums will once again fall in Telangana,” read a weather report issued by Skymet, an independent weather forecasting agency.

As predicted by Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad, thunderstorm activity intensified during evening hours with the city experiencing cold and damp weather conditions. According to Telangana State Development Planning Society (TSDPS), Mondamarket in Secunderabad received highest rainfall of 52.3 mm followed by 43 mm in Begumpet and 37.8 mm in Seethaphalmandi. The rainfall was triggered by a cyclonic circulation over northern Telangana. “Currently, the city is witnessing southeasterly winds which have higher moisture level. This moisture results in formation of rain-bearing clouds which caused the thunderstorm activity,” said Raja Rao, Indian Meteorological Department The merging of winds is instrumental for cloud formation and subsequent rainfall.

Few hours of rainfall led to water logging in many areas thereby causes traffic snarls. Waterlogging was reported at I-Labs U-turn to Nectar Garden towards COD junction, Palak Hotel near Erragadda metro station towards Kukatpally.

DEHRADUN: For over six years, Mobin Ansari — a 62-yearold woman hailing from Sitarganj in Uttarakhand ’s Udham Singh Nagar district — had been leading the life of a widow after her husband Jameel Ahmed Ansari went missing and was presumed dead in the 2013 Kedarnath tragedy, which left many dead and several untraceable.

However, on the last day of 2019, Mobin got a video call from Chamoli and to her surprise, it was from her husband. He had been located by police during the ‘ Operation Smile ’ conducted by them to trace missing persons at a shelter home at Gopeshwar in Chamoli, where he had been living for the past few years with his memory all but gone. Police officials managed to trace his whereabouts after putting up his picture on social media. The 65-year-old was reunited with his family on New Year’s Day.

Cops questioned Kedarnath flood survivor in 2016

Piecing together Jameel’s story, sub-inspector Nitin Bisht, who is handling ‘Operation Smile’ in Chamoli district, told TOI that Jameel, 65, was working as a labourer in Lambagad in June 2013.

When disaster struck, he was carried away in the currents of the Alaknanda and had no recollection of what happened thereafter, Bisht said. Bisht said that police officials had also questioned Jameel in 2016 when they spotted him in the shelter home. “At that time, he identified himself as Zaheer Khan . In the first week of December last year, we visited the home again and this time, he said his name was Jameel.”

Jameel’s picture was circulated among social media groups and his nephew identified him. On January 1, Mobin and her elder son went to Gopeshwar, where police handed over Jameel to them.

HYDERABAD: The Telangana government on Thursday declared 2020 as the year of artificial intelligence (AI) and inked nine memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with IT players and educational institutions to develop various use cases as well as conduct research on the application of AI and creation of talent pool in this area.

Intel, Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) and IIIT- Hyderabad jointly inked a pact with the government for setting up a research centre in applied AI in healthcare and mobility.

Speaking at the event, Nivruti Rai, country head, Intel India, said, “AI is going to make a $13 trillion addition to the world economy, if you think AI, there are five characteristics of data that are essential to drive its success – quality, quantity, depth, access and diversity and India has it all.” She said Intel will be working with IIIT-Hyderabad, PHFI and state government to leverage AI to broaden the access of quality healthcare to masses.

The state also inked a pact with Nvidia that will be setting up a high performance computing AI centre in Hyderabad. The government entered into a MoU with IIT-Kharagpur to set up an AI centre of excellence and research and development park in the city. Telangana will also be partnering with Adobe, IIT Hyderabad for capacity building in AI.

“As we all know, machine readable data is the core of any AI/ML algorithm. Realizing that availability of quality data would be a key differentiator, we had launched the open data policy and published data related to about 20 departments on the open data platform... The aim, going forward, is to democratise seamless availability of data by creating population scale curated public data sets, especially in the areas of mobility, healthcare, agriculture and e-governance, leading to better innovation, governance and successful business outcomes,” Telangana IT minister KT Rama Rao said, adding that Telangana would create India AI Data Trust that would be a resource centre of such data sets.

He also added the state would work with partners to make available a high-performance AI Computing (HPAIC) infrastructure for startups and research centers.

HYDERABAD: Non-communicable diseases like diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular problems, cancer, and kidney ailments take a heavy toll on the health profile of the residents living in old city of Hyderabad. A health survey by an NGO in areas south of the river Musi has revealed that about 12% of the adults have diabetes and about 20% have reported hypertension while 5% suffer from heart diseases.The NGO, Helping Hand Foundation (HHF), in its survey report released on Thursday said the incidence of cancer is increasing in the city. About one-third of the cancer cases in Telangana are from Hyderabad. The cancer of head and neck, particularly oral cancer in men, breast cancer in women and blood cancer in children below 5 years is causing concern, the report said.“Pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB is also alarmingly high in teenage population of old city. An estimated 600 to 700 new cases of TB are reported every month,” the report said, adding that one in three families with one or more members with noncommunicable diseases are under the burden of loans or are in debt due to borrowing money to meet medical expenses.Helping Hand Foundation managing trustee Mujtaba Hasan Askari said about 25% of households in old city slums suffer from chronic illnesses. Many students of higher education are forced to discontinue studies to take up menial jobs to support the families.He said about 13,000 patients from poor sections of society were provided medical help during 2019 in government hospitals. Patients were encouraged to approach government hospitals, and this had helped the poor families save about ₹7 crore during the year.The rising burden of noncommunicable diseases is putting a huge amount of mental and financial stress on the common man from the city and by linking them to the public health system a great amount of justice is being done, Mujtaba Hasan added.As part of the survey, HHF volunteers visited houses and hospitals in the city, particularly in old city, to collect data about various health issues vis-à-vis the financial burden the families are subjected to due to non-communicable diseases. Several health checkup camps were set up and data collected during such exercises were computed to arrive at the burden of disease in old city and other parts of Hyderabad.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73077657,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-324908,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ngo-survey-reveals-rising-burden-of-diseases-in-hyderabad/articleshow/73077658.cms

File photo of a woman drawing kolam on road

CHENNAI: Anti-corruption NGO Arappor Iyakkam on Thursday condemned Chennai police commissioner A K Vishwanathan for referring to the NGO while talking about kolam protests. The NGO alleged that it was purposefully done to somehow connect it with Pakistan and tarnish its image among the public.

During a press meet on Wednesday, Vishwanathan alleged that one protester, Gayatri Khandhadai, was being probed for her ‘Pakistani links’ based on her social media activity. He alleged that she was in touch with groups such as Popular Front of India (PFI) and Arappor Iyakkam.

“This is part of a witchhunt launched against Arappor and its office-bearers for our continued expose about corruption in Greater Chennai Corporation . Vishwanathan has misused the police force to file a series of false FIRs against us,” Jayaram Venkatesan, convenor of Arappor Iyakkam, said. Indoor meetings of the NGO have been stopped and hall owners have been asked not to give space, Arappor said.

Vishwanathan told TOI that several FIRs had been filed against Arappor Iyakkam and its office-bearers. “They are facing trial in these cases. They have raised false allegations in the past and these allegations are also false,” he said.

Arappor questioned why Vishwanathan did not name principal opposition party DMK while speaking about parties that condemned Chennai police’s arrest of kolam protestors. “Is it because he will lose his chance of becoming DGP if DMK comes to power in 2021,” the statement said.

Arappor said last June, Vishwanathan asked Jayaram to meet local bodies minister S P Velumani to sort out issues and that the commissioner was under pressure from the minister to deny permission to Arappor’s events.

MUMBAI: Faced with redemptions of government securities (G-Secs) aggregating Rs 1.35 lakh crore till January 16, the government on Thursday said it will auction cash management bills (CMBs) on Monday to mop up Rs 30,000 crore. This is the second CMB in the last two weeks. The government usually issues CMBs to tide over situations of temporary liquidity mismatch.

RBI data shows that on Thursday the government had a redemption worth Rs 61,000 crore, while another worth Rs 74,000 crore is due on January 16. To meet this large demand for liquidity, the government is auctioning CMBs, bond dealers said. On December 31, the government had mobilised Rs 30,000 crore through CMBs of 76-day tenure. The CMBs that will be auctioned on Monday will have a tenure of 70 days, the RBI release showed.

During the day, the central bank also announced its third ‘operation twist’, a move in which the government’s banker will buy G-Secs of long and medium tenure worth Rs 10,000 crore and at the same time sell government bonds of less than one year tenure. This is the third such operation by the RBI in as many weeks, aimed at pulling down the 10-year benchmark yield, which is one of the main determinants of the lending rates by banks.

Since February this year, the RBI has cut interest rate five times, by a total of 135 basis points (100 basis points = 1 percentage point). However, just before the first operation twist was announced on December 19, the aggregate decline in yield on the 10-year G-Sec was 80bps — from 7.55% in early-February to 6.75% on that day. Even after two such operations by the RBI, the benchmark yield on 10-year G-Secs on Thursday closed at 6.51%, translating to a decline of 24bps in the last three weeks.

File photo of a Chennai Metro train

CHENNAI: It has been nearly a year since the city’s largest underground interchange metro station at Central opened for service, but commuters are still struggling to find space to park their vehicles as the planned parking lot is yet to be opened. But according to CMRL, there will soon be some relief, as an underground parking space is expected to open by mid-January. The lot will be able to hold 100 cars and 300 two-wheelers at a time.

“We are fixing glass panes at the entrance of the parking lot. It will be ready in another 15 days,” an official said. Central metro became operational in February 2019 when the last leg of the 45km phase-1 from Washermenpet to AG-DMS via Central metro was thrown open to public.

Till now, metro rail commuters at Central struggle to find parking space and end up leaving their vehicles either at Central railway station or near the Ripon Buildings. The hassle of finding space is even worse for those arriving at the station for the first time, since they are not aware that the parking lot is not ready. “It was my first time at the metro and I went around the junction in front of Central station thrice looking for parking space, until a CMRL staff told me the parking lot is not open. It was a struggle as it was peak hour traffic,” said S Harish of Vepery.

The parking lot under construction is on the concourse level of Central metro and is linked to the entrance through a ramp. Once opened, officials said it can be used both by metro rail commuters as well as others. Passengers taking suburban trains at Moore Market Complex or outstation trains at Central Railway Station too could use the facility, as the parking lot is closer to these transport hubs. Passengers to Park and Park Town stations could also use the facility as it is only a pedestrian subway away.

Several other stations along the two corridors of phase-1do not have parking space.

On Thursday, a hydraulic system that can hold five twowheelers at a height of about 9ft, with space for five to be parked at the ground level was opened at Meenambakkam metro station on a trial basis. “We will wait to see its safety and response from commuters for a month before extending it to other stations. We will build a level between street level and concourse for parking in station,” an official said.

HYDERABAD: In a good news for the state reeling under economic slowdown, GST collection data released by Union finance ministry shows that Telangana recorded 13% growth in GST collection in December 2019, as compared to December 2018.As per the data, in December 2018, GST collections were ₹3,014 crore, whereas in 2019, the collections went up to ₹3,420 crore. Though Tamil Nadu and Kerala are ahead of Telangana, officials attributed the increase to better GST compliance by traders and companies and good business growth. “Development happens due to various reasons, we feel that things will get back to normal, this is natural,” said planning board vice-chairman B Vinod Kumar.Meanwhile, the country’s GST revenue during December 2019 from domestic transactions showed an impressive growth of 16% as compared to 2018. The neighbouring state of Andhra Pradesh witnessed a 11% growth in competitive figures. In December 2018, AP’s GST collections were ₹2,049 crore and in December 2018, the collections stood at ₹2,265 crore.Experts said that this could be a good sign for the state, stating that if the GST collection grows further in the next two to three months, it would mean that the economy is recovering from the slowdown. “Last month, the government made strict measures for GST collection, in general, in December the collection improved due to festivities,” said financial expert and former IDBI director Narsimha Murthy.Experts further observed that the GST collection indicates slow growth, but added that many other factors will come into play which will help the GDP grow as both GST and GDP growth are interlinked.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73077703,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-81311,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-records-13-growth-in-december-gst-collection/articleshow/73077710.cms
129,['3/01/2020'],ATF Price Hike in Chennai: ATF price hike could force airlines to avoid refuelling in Chennai,"This story is from January 3, 2020

Fuel price varies from one airport to the other because state governments charge different slabs of tax.

CHENNAI: An increase in price of aviation turbine fuel (ATF) has made Chennai the second most expensive city to buy jet fuel, which can force airlines to avoid refuelling in the city airport. This will also lead to a hike in air fares.

ATF fuel prices were increased by 2.6% on January

1. This makes the one kilo litre of ATF to cost ₹65, 619 in Chennai airport while it costs ₹70,588 in Kolkata, the highest in a metro airport. Prices are lower in Mumbai and Delhi.

The price was ₹63,830 per kilo litre in Chennai as of December 1, 2018. Now, airlines will have to pay ₹1,789 more. An A320 type plane uses around six tonnes of fuel for a short domestic flight.

This is expected to encourage airlines to lift fuel from other airports and not from Chennai. The process called tankering or carrying more fuel than needed for a trip will go up, said a pilot.

""If an aircraft needs only six tonnes of fuel, the pilot will try to carry 12tonnes depending on the passenger and cargo load so that the next sector can also be flown without refueling in Chennai,"" he added.

This practice is expected to increase in the coming days as most of the domestic carriers fly multiple routes using the same plane. Since, Mumbai and Delhi is the hub for airlines to park their planes as the airports have more parking bays than in Chennai, there is a chance that pilots will carry fuel from Mumbai.

""This is likely to impact the load of the plane and quantity of cargo may have to be reduced to carry fuel. However, flights flying from Chennai to Delhi may have to carry extra fuel than they usually carry because air congestion caused by fog is leading to delays and diversions. This will be a loss,"" said an airline official.

The fuel price varies from one airport to the other because state governments charge a tax. The tax is higher in Tamil Nadu. There was a call to make prices or taxes uniform across all airports.

An official of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) said that ""The state government has reduced the tax for fuel at small airports like Coimbatore. But, in Chennai they charge high because refueling is high and there is scope for earning more money.""

Air Passengers Association of Indi national president D Sudhakara Reddy said ""Air fares are bound to go up. Already airlines are incurring loss because of the mess caused by air congestion in Delhi. The congestion is having a cascading effect of delays at all airports. This will add to it. Its surprising that they are increasing the jet fuel price though price of crude has reduced from $68 per barrel to $66.""

CHENNAI: A 25-year-old man who latched on to an electric pole for support while crossing a water-logged stretch in Selaiyur on Thursday was electrocuted.

Police said Senthil Kumar, a resident of the Tambaram Railway Quarters, was an employee on an online shopping firm. The incident happened at 1.30am on Velachery Main Road, just a few metres from the Selaiyur police station.

An electrician who was involved in removing a series of decorative lights set up at the Selaiyur police station for the New Year celebrations saw Senthil Kumar jumping over the stagnant patch of water. Senthil lost control and held an electric pole when he was thrown away.

The electrician immediately rushed to the spot and alerted police.

Senthil died on the spot. His body was sent to the Chromepet Government hospital for postmortem. Police said power leakage from the electric pole may have caused the death.

Green cover within forest area dips: Study

KOLKATA: A marginal increase in Bengal’s forest cover has been offset by a much larger loss in non-forest greenery, the India State of Forest Report 2019 has revealed.According to the report, the state’s forest cover has increased 0.3% — from 16,847sq km in 2017 to 16,901sq km in 2019. However, greenery in non-forest areas has declined 6.1% — from 2,136sq km in 2017 to 2,006sq km.Green activists say it is a reflection of large-scale tree-felling for “developmental projects” without adequate compensatory plantation. In Kolkata itself, decades-old trees with large canopies have been felled to widen roads and construct bridges. The saplings that have been planted in return are either scrubs or ornamental.“Systematic annual plantation to augment urban green cover has ceased,” said Bonani Kakkar of NGO People United for Better Living in Calcutta (PUBLIC). “Trees were felled to construct foot-overbridges in at least three locations — Gariahat Road (near Ballygunge Siksha Sadan), the Exide crossing (near Calcutta Club) and Park Street (near Asiatic Society). But the projects were later dumped. Meanwhile, trees that had taken 20-30 years to grow are gone. Along Camac Street, scores of full-grown trees were hacked to widen the road. When we questioned whether compensatory plantation had been done, civic officials claimed they had done it at the Park Circus Maidan. But an inspection proved otherwise. It was only thereafter that some trees were planted elsewhere,” she pointed out.S P Pandey of the Society for Protecting Ophiofauna and Animal Rights (SPOAR), an NGO that works for the protection of greenery in north Bengal, says what’s needed is a change in mindset and a recognition that trees are valuable assets. “When a project is conceived, the environmental loss is not factored in,” he pointed out. “We need to scientifically determine the value of a tree and calculate the loss of cutting down a certain number of trees for a project. Only then will there be an attempt to design a project so that few trees need to be felled. Since there is no value attributed to trees at present, they are hacked down even before a project has been finalized.”Chief conservator of forest (conservation and extension) Raju Das suggests more social forestry programmes to augment the non-forest green cover. “There are a lot of urban spaces that belong to various government agencies where urban forestry can happen,” he felt.Hidco plans to set up an urban forest at New Town while a similar initiative is being taken by Kolkata Port Trust on a plot it owns near Hyde Road.Ravi Kant Sinha, the state’s chief wildlife warden, credited the increase in overall forest cover to long-term conservation activities and plantation drives outside forested areas.While south Bengal’s forest cover had dwindled alarmingly in the 1970s and 1980s, a shift to joint forest conservation by making locals stakeholders in forestry initiatives has yielded results — so much so that around 100 elephants from Jharkhand have made newly forested areas in the region their habitat.While forest cover outside the forest has gone up by 112sq km, that within the recorded forest area of the state has registered a marginal decline of 57sq km. The very dense forest cover, moderately dense forest cover and open forest cover in Bengal now stands at 3,018.5sq km, 4,160.3sq km and 9,722.7sq km, respectively.A look at the district-wise break-up revealed that South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas, North Dinajpur, Murshidabad and Howrah have recorded decrease in forest cover, while Bankura, West Midnapore, Purulia and Birbhum have recorded a rise.While Bankura logged a growth of 15.6sq km in its forest cover, South 24 Parganas, which houses a vast stretch of the Sunderbans, has witnessed a dip in forest cover by 3.3sq km.“Our social forestry work in south Bengal districts has started showing results. Though there has been a dip of about 2sq km in Bengal’s mangrove cover, there’s nothing to worry as it’s marginal,” Sinha added.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73077792,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-672322,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-slight-rise-in-forest-cover-larger-loss-of-urban-trees/articleshow/73077748.cms

Ramsundar Chauhan

GORAKHPUR: A seafarer from Gorakhpur , who is now back to his hometown, recalled how he was kidnapped by pirates along with 18 Indian crew members on December 3 when his ship was returning from Nigeria .

Ramsundar Chauhan, a resident of Harpur Budhat of Gorakhpur district is a fitter at Anglo Eastern ship management company in Mumbai and has been seafarer since 2007. “On December 3, after loading crude oil, we set on our return journey from Nigeria to Orissa. Our captain asked the director of the harbour for security arrangement but the director said it would only be made available when the ship reaches pirate-affected zone. After four hours around 7.30 pm, the captain announced that the ship had been hijacked. I saw nine pirates on the deck, laced with hi-tech arms,” Ramsundar Chauhan said.

“They caught hold of us, thrashed us, and sent us to the boat with the help of a rope. When the boat was full, pirates left five people on the ship. The boat sailed all night after which were made to walk for around two hours in a dense forest to a place where there were more armed pirates. They kept on changing our place,” he added. He said he did not sleep for 8 nights due to fear. “We were given raw noodles to eat on some days, while on other days, we managed without food,” he said.

135,['3/01/2020'],Fasting can slow down ageing!,"There’s no denying to the fact that a youthful and glowing skin makes you look more beautiful. No matter how expensive treatments and cosmetics you go for, nothing shines brighter than a healthy glowing skin. In fact, a healthy body and a sane mind is all we need to look beautiful.However, we often end up ignoring our health and our face is a mere reflection of our inner health. In simple words, we are what we eat and our skin is a mirror of our health, whatever we feed it reflects! Our metabolism is the foundation of a healthy and youthful skin, but what happens when you start dieting? Does that impact your skin and lead to skin aging? Read on to find out more about it !Fasting or call it fad dieting, to an extent healthy fasting helps the body maintain a healthy balance, but going for extensive and auesterious fasting to lose weight can simply affect your overall health and the visible signs of it our pretty evident on the skin.According to a recent study, fasting increases the body’s metabolic activity, which further leads to a healthy body and skin. Moreover, it also imparts anti-aging benefits. In fact, fad diets like intermittent fasting helps in losing weight and can increase lifespan.As per a study conducted by Dr. Takayuki Teruya and a team of scientists at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University in Japan, the study was conducted to examine the impact of metabolism on skin aging. As per the research, the fasting and calorie restriction boosts metabolism and immunity.While fasting, our body starves for a prolonged period of time, which leads to metabolic changes. Our body derives energy from the food we eat and in the absence of that our body banks on the stored fats to derive glucose (energy) and this process is known as gluconeogenesis. The body extracts glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, such as amino acids. Another good thing about fasting is that it leads to higher level of purines and pyrimidine in the body which increases the level of antioxidants in the body, which help in improving the overall health and improves the skin health too.As per the study, the increase in antioxidants helps in sustaining a balance, while the body is starving. This happens to be the body's natural mechanism to deal with starvation. This further helps in building back the loss caused due to oxidative stress and free radicals.In simple words, fasting and eating healthy helps the body to maintain a healthy balance, which further leads to strengthening the metabolism, which further improves the immunity. And the hike in the level of antioxidants lead to a healthy skin and reduces skin aging. However, after fasting the intake of healthy food reduces skin aging. So, eating at the right interval and eating healthy is the key to a healthy skin.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73068143,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-231949/73068143.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/food-news/can-fasting-slow-down-aging/articleshow/73067733.cms

Representative image

PUNE: A 14-year-old boy was beaten up and brutally assaulted with a sharp weapon around 5.45pm on Wednesday at a PMPML bus stop in Gadital near Hadapsar police station by three students allegedly over an old dispute.

The injured boy is undergoing treatment in the intensive care unit of a private hospital. “He has suffered major injury to the lungs and left hand. Both are treatable. His condition is stable,” said a doctor from the hospital.

The police on Thursday detained the three assailants, all minors, after the injured boy’s father lodged an FIR under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code , Arms Act and Maharashtra Police Act.

Senior inspector Raghunath Jadhav of the Hadapsar police said, “According to investigations carried out by us so far, we feel that the incident was fallout of a previous dispute between the students.”

The injured boy’s father, a businessman, differed. He told TOI that the suspects had assaulted his son at the behest of an organisation against which he had given a complaint application to the Hadapsar police on December 30, stating that it had installed illegal flexes and banners in the Unnatinagar area publicising a public meeting planned on January 1.

“I had requested the police to refuse permission to the rally. As my son was assaulted two days after I made the complaint against the organisation, I suspect involvement of its members,” he said.

The boy’s father said, “I repeatedly appealed to the police to take my complaint (regarding the assault of his son) as per my version, but they avoided naming the organisation and its members in the FIR.”

He said, “My son was in the process of boarding the bus for returning home when one of the students attacked him with the sickle on his left hand and chest. The others thrashed and kicked him after he fell. The sickle was seized from the spot.”

Senior inspector Jadhav said, “The boy’s father has not named any organisation in the FIR. Our inquiry has revealed that there is no evidence to suggest that the organisation or its members were responsible for the attack on the boy. Yet, if the father of the injured boy wants to make a supplementary statement to the FIR, we shall record and investigate it.”

Jadhav said all the three detained students studied in Class X and were aged between 15 and 16 years. “The students are not related to any organisation,” he added.

138,['3/01/2020'],West Bengal: Rs 1 crore lottery winner goes to cops seeking protection,"Indra Narayan Sen shows photocopies of the 10 lottery tickets he bought

Winner to get cash in 3 months

KALNA (EAST BURDWAN): Seventy-year-old Indra Narayan Sen is not used to fame. But he’s had loads of it — more than he ever wanted — since Sunday, thanks to a little attention from Lady Luck.On Sunday, the septuagenarian won a Rs 1-crore lottery . Three days later, he turned up at the Kalna police station, pleading with officer-in-charge Rakesh Singh for security. He told the officer that he was afraid to step out of home since he became an overnight crorepati.Sen, a former deep tubewell operator who retired nearly a decade back, lives in his unimposing home at Sahapara village in East Burdwan’s Kalna on a very modest pension of Rs 10,000. On Sunday, almost on a whim, he bought 10 daily Nagaland state lottery tickets for Rs 60. “I had gone to the Guptipara market and bought those tickets as an afterthought,” he told TOI. “I kept the tickets folded in my pockets and did not even bother to check the results.”Siddheswari Lottery Center owner Mintu Biswas, who sold the tickets to Sen, however, did keep an eye on the results, declared around 8pm. He found out that a ticket purchased from his shop by Sen had struck the jackpot. Biswas started to deck up his small shop with flowers and offered sweets to passers-by. He then set out to track down Sen to inform him of his windfall.“When the shop-owner came to my home to alert me, I did not believe him,” Sen said. “But, when he insisted, I accompanied him to his shop to check the results (which Biswas had downloaded and printed out from a local cyber-cafe). I was convinced only then. But I did not share this with anyone because I was anxious. I have never seen so much money. When I retired, I got around Rs 1 lakh. So, I got scared.”But the word was already out. “Biswas told everyone that I had won the Rs one-crore prize money,” Sen said.Sen admits that the lottery win has completely changed his life. “Everyone wishes to congratulate me, even advise me what to do with the money. Some even want to shake my hand. People whom I have never seen before are coming down to my home to offer help,” he says.He has visited the local SBI branch to deposit the lottery ticket. “The amount will be credited to my account within three months,” he said. “But I cannot be at peace as long as I have this spotlight on me.” Which is why, he says, he went to the cops. Officer-in-charge Singh has assured him of all help. “I have even given him my number and asked him to inform me about any problem he faces. We are keeping a watch on the situation.”As for Sen, he has already decided what to do with the prize money. “I want to donate a part of it to build a Durga temple at my in-laws’ place. I want to offer some money as dakshina and offer puja. The rest, I will divide among my three sons and grandsons. My pension is enough for me and my wife to spend the rest of our lives. I just want to secure the future of my sons and grandsons.”",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73077836,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-516775,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/too-much-attention-rs-1-crore-lottery-winner-goes-to-cops-seeking-protection/articleshow/73077824.cms

Two persons enjoy the morning walk on Thursday

PUNE: The minimum temperature is expected to rise marginally over the next few days in the city after dropping to season’s lowest of 10.8°C on Wednesday.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) recorded a minimum temperature of 12.7°C (2.2° above normal) in Shivajinagar on Thursday. The minimum temperature stood at 13.4°C in Lohegaon , which was1.4° above normal.

When it comes to the maximum temperature, it stayed at 31.8°C (1.8° above normal), the IMD said, adding that the maximum humidity level remained at 92%.

IMD officials said most parts of the state were unlikely tobe affectedby colder northerly winds, which is why temperatures were expected to stay stable over the next few days.

“We have forecast mainly clear skies for the city. The maximum temperatures will remain around 30-31°C. However, there will be a marginal rise in the minimum temperatures in Pune. In thesurrounding region, the temperatures will be more or less the same. This is because easterly, southeasterly, and southerly winds are dominant in the region, which are blocking northerly winds from entering the region,” Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather at IMD, Pune, said.

Kashyapi said parts of Nashik and Jalgaon districts as well as the northern parts of Marathwada would experience slightly lower minimums in the next 24 hours due to the colder northerly winds.

KOLKATA: For the fourth successive year since the state launched the ‘Safe Drive Save Life’ campaign, Kolkata Police has brought good news for the residents. There has been a significant drop in both fatal and non-fatal accidents in 2019. Police said 260 fatal accidents led to 267 deaths in 2019 as against 294 deaths in 283 fatal accidents in 2018. In 2016 and 2017, there were 407 and 329 deaths, respectively.Non-fatal accidents last year saw 2,012 persons being injured in 1,804 cases as compared to 2,162 persons being injured in 2,244 cases in 2018.The good news, though, is not limited only to the overall decrease in accidents, there is significant progress in controlling rogue bikers. Deaths of bikers have fallen significantly from 82 in 2018 to 58. Even among the victims, who lost their lives, merely 20 were found not wearing helmets as compared to 50 last year. Even night time accidents (8pm-6am) has seen a decrease. From a high of 110 in 2018, there were 87 deaths in 2019.Some concern areas, however, remain. Involvement of two of the city’s most popular public transports — buses and autos — has witnessed a sharp rise in accidents. Worse, pedestrians yet again ended up as the most likely accident victims — from contributing 50% of victims in 2018 to accounting for 56% of all deaths in 2019.While buses were involved in 97 fatal accidents in 2019, up from 85 in 2018, autos in 10 fatal accidents, compared to seven in the previous year. Compare this to two-wheelers, where fatalities decreased from 37 to 22 and private cars from 23 to 19. Deaths by goods vehicles, too, fell from 70 to 63.Such has been the rogue bus scare in the city that even in non-fatal accidents, the buses have overtaken cars in 2019. Buses were involved in a total of 497 accidents, almost more than one accident a day, compared to 470 in 2018. Cars were involved in 458 accidents last year, compared to 511 in 2018. Autos saw a huge rise from 98 accidents n 2018 to 128 in 2019.The overall success in controlling accidents, especially involving bikes, has been attributed to increase in patrolling on the streets, especially at night. “The decreasing trend in road accident cases in the city reflects on the success of #SafeDriveSaveLive campaign. Regular naka checking against rash and negligent driving and prosecutions against helmetless riders combined with awareness campaigns have given good results,” commissioner Anuj Sharma shared on his Facebook page.Joint CP (traffic) Santosh Pandey said they have already set their goals for 2020. “The issuance of challans against unnecessary honking has increased to 1,00,400 this year in 2019 from 35,119 a year ago. These special drives will continue. But we are eyeing to cut down on bus accidents. For this, we will start drawing up new safety awareness drives and training of drivers.

PUNE: The cybercrime police arrested a Nigerian national on Wednesday night from an ATM kiosk in Undri on the charges of installing a card cloning device and a pinhole camera on the ATM at 5am the same day.

The police have seized a card cloning unit (skimming machine), an electronic circuit , a data card and a pinhole camera which he had installed on the machine.

A team comprising senior inspector Jayram Paygude and assistant inspector Sagar Panmand of cybercrime police received a tip-off regarding the cloning of cards at an ATM kiosk in Undri.

“Following this, we decided to lay a trap near the ATM kiosk and arrested the Nigerian national, John Michael Andrew (35), who was residing in Pisoli,” Paygude said.

The CCTV cameras installed in the ATM kiosk recorded a man entering the kiosk and installing some devices on the ATM unit early in the morning on Wednesday. The bank officials thus notified the police.

The police did not remove the electronic circuits installed on the unit but at the same time they alerted the ATM kiosk visitors and asked them to not to withdraw cash.

Paygude said, “Around 10pm, Andrew visited the ATM kiosk and was dismantling the card skimmer and other electronic devices when the police team caught him red-handed.”

He was produced before a city court on Thursday which remanded him in the police custody till January 8, police said. Questioning revealed that Andrew had come to India on students’ visa and was pursuing some educational course in Delhi. He claimed that he had left his visa and passport in Delhi. “We will soon verify his version of the account,” Paygude said.

“Police will study the data of the skimmer machine to ascertain if it has been used earlier at different ATM units,” an officer said.

Police have appealed to citizens to remain alert and exercise caution while making any transactions at ATM units.

Kiara Advani says, ‘Thank god’ as other B-town actresses expressed their reservation on playing Preeti in 'Kabir Singh'","Bollywood actress Kiara Advani is currently riding high on the huge success of her recently released film ‘ Good Newwz ’. The film also stars Kareena Kapoor Khan Akshay Kumar and Diljit Dosanjh in the lead roles. Kiara has been receiving rave reviews for her character.The actress who started off her glorious run in 2019 with ‘ Kabir Singh ’ alongside Shahid Kapoor , ended the year on high note with ‘Good Newwz’. Despite ‘Kabir Singh’ getting criticised by a certain section of people, the film managed to steal the hearts of the audiences.Recently, ETimes met Kiara for an exclusive interaction where she spoke about the criticism her film faced. She says, “Well, I think everybody's entitled to have their opinion and everybody put forth their opinions, so whatever had to be said is already been said and I would leave it to that.” Ask her if she received any criticism from her friends and family, Kiara says that they will be obviously biased towards her.“Well, I think everyone liked it, as the audience did! My friends and family in a way will always be biased. We had discussions like any normal film you have discussions. They know me as a person and they know how different I am. They understand that it’s just a film and at the end of the day it’s a fictional character and there are people like this in society that exist, who are flawed and its very human. Maybe that's why it hit harder. But I think at the end of the day they are my friends and family! (Laughs).”‘Kabir Singh’ was largely called out for glamourising misogyny and toxic masculinity and questioning Shahid’s responsibility as an actor. After the release of the film, there were many actresses who said that they wouldn’t have done the film because of the content. When we asked Kiara if at any point, was she also skeptical about doing the film, she happily says, “Thank god! I don't want to share this role (laughs).”She further adds, “I watched the original movie, so I had my opinions on it. But I felt like those are my opinions and as an actor, I am playing a part which doesn't have to be me. So I never judged the character while I was playing it. Maybe as an audience, I did sit back and say, ‘Oh, I wouldn't have done that’, maybe this and this is different. But maybe what connected with me when I watched the original was the love story and I felt, that was so powerful and impactful that it just for me superseded everything else. I hadn't seen a love story like that in a very long and that's exactly what Kabir Singh did. Even today, any photo I put with anybody, with any other co-star, with a friend, sometimes with whoever, I have a meme of Kabir Singh with Shahid sitting on the bike and these memes are so funny, how much we laugh, because I know that certain characters go down in history and this feels like one of those. So we can't, we will never be able to and we don't even want to because it’s so special. Preeti for people will always be special. So now I have to hopefully win them over Monica and all the other characters.”- By: Sneha Hiro",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73077930,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-297703/73077930.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/exclusive-kiara-advani-says-thank-god-as-other-b-town-actresses-expressed-their-reservation-on-playing-preeti-in-kabir-singh/articleshow/73077939.cms

LUCKNOW: A group of inebriated men allegedly pelted stones at a family in Indiranagar for asking them not to drink in front of the house, leaving a boy celebrating his 15th birthday injured and a four-wheeler damaged on Wednesday night.

Prime accused Vivek was arrested for assault, rioting, damaging property and criminal intimidation, among others, but he secured bail on Thursday. Vivek’s aides, who were at least 10 in number, are on the run and remain unidentified. The boy, Shiva, fortunately escaped with a minor head wound that only needed dressing.

In his FIR, Shiva’s uncle Sajan Shukla said their extended family had gathered to wish the birthday boy around 7.30pm when he noticed the drunk men outside his house in Takrohi under Indiranagar police station. As Shukla asked them to leave the spot, Vivek allegedly became abusive and that led to a heated exchange of words.

The commotion brought other family members outside, and Vivek and his aides allegedly began pelting stones. One of the stone missiles flew directly at Shiva while a few others damaged Shukla’s SUV.

The family dialled 112, but before the cops arrived, the men fled in the SUV they had come in.

MUMBAI: Even as consensus on the distribution of portfolios remains elusive, the allotment of bungalows to ministers and even office space was done on Thursday. NCP leader and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar has been allotted the prized Devgiri bungalow in Malabar Hill .Pawar occupied Devgiri in the Congress-NCP regime (1999-2014). When BJP was in office, it became the residence of former finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar. Sources say at least two other ministers had asked for Devgiri this time, but their request was denied.Former CM Ashok Chavan was allotted the Meghdoot bungalow which was occupied by Sena’s Diwakar Raote in the previous government. Shivgiri was allotted to Dilip Walse Patil. He had stayed in Shivgiri in 2011 while he was the speaker. Aaditya Thackeray has been allotted a less imposing bungalow (A-6) opposite Mantralaya at Nariman Point . His office is on the seventh floor.Officials said most ministers’ bungalows will need refurbishment. “Everytime a new minister takes over a bungalow he generally hands out a list of renovations he wants us to do. The sea-facing bungalows are also old and tend to leak and so repairs will be required in them,""said an official.All the 30 cabinet ministers have been allocated offices in Mantralaya while the six junior ministers will have to operate from Vidhan Bhavan, said officials. Ajit Pawar’s office is on the sixth floor in Mantralaya, considered the power centre: the CM and chief secretary's offices are on the same floor. Pawar has his in the north wing-—he did not want to occupy room 602, considered 'unlucky' as its last three occupants did not fare well. ""Now, general administration department will be moved to 602 and Pawar's office will come up in its place,"" said an official. Renovation of rooms began on Thursday.All said, in the absence of portfolios, work at Mantralaya remains at a standstill.

148,['3/01/2020'],"Will changing the five-day Test format pay off, or make it vulnerable to more tinkering?","Ben Stokes. (Reuters Photo)

NEW DELHI: The end of the last day. It has a nice apocalyptic ring to it. The International Cricket Council ’s ( ICC ) new proposal to consider curtailing the length of Test matches by one day, from five to four — with an aim to free up space and streamline the calendar from 2023 onwards — has been perceived as a disruptive move in a cricketing world which cleaves all too easily.On one side are those vehemently opposed to the move, including top Australian cricketers and their coach. They feel chopping a day off would introduce the element of time, altering the format’s free-flowing nature. Stripped of their essence, Tests would merely become a longform limited-overs format, they argue.On the other side are the ever-gaping maws of world cricket’s commercial engine, demanding more of the instant variety of the sport. Those operating it have essentially dismissed all naysayers as ‘traditionalists’ or ‘purists’. Both terms have acquired pessimistic overtones in recent times, since many administrators and broadcasters agree that a new, revitalized World Test Championship, comprising of four-day Tests, would freshen things up.It is a fact that attentions spans have shortened. It is also a fact that most Tests are ending inside four days or earlier, apart from some of the marquee contests in the ‘creamy layer’, between the top three or four nations, which require the extra day to settle the debate.This trend (see graphic) of matches finishing earlier than anticipated is a problem because it is expensive to stage a Test and the financial returns aren’t commensurate. Organizers basically care about the footfalls on the first twothree days and the entire financial structure balances itself out with eyeballs in shorter formats. Also, the five-day format is not set in stone. Tests have been three-day, four-day or ‘timeless’ affairs in the distant past, creating its own caste system in which the maximum allowed days were reserved for contests between ‘deserving’ stronger teams or for the deciding game of a series.The extra space in the calendar from such a move, the ICC argues, is intended to free up space for more manoeuvering in the schedule. It is not meant to give more rest to the players, but may end up benefitting Tests too, since a four-day Test can start on a Thursday and end on a Sunday to boost ticket sales and live TV viewership. So goes the theory, to which both the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and Cricket Australia (CA) seem to have given a preliminary nod.However, these plans, and the ensuing debates, have highlighted a paradox at the heart of modern Test cricket . The format feels unwanted but it basically still defines the sport. It is a niche brand which celebrates the sport’s fullest possibilities. Tests are, till today, cricket’s heartbeat, in spite of a decades-old international white-ball circuit.Just ask the players. The ebb and flow of a Test match, on a steadily wearing pitch, acquires a life of its own, charming participants into engaging in a duel of mental and physical skill, endurance and strategy which is unique to sport. The so-called ‘dull’ moments are merely part of the larger tapestry. At its best, Test cricket has no peer.This is important not because everyone has to appreciate Test cricket, but because the format is now stranded at the crossroads, between commercial considerations and the credibility of history. It is vulnerable. Chopping a day off now would expose it to further tinkering if things don’t work out, like making every four-day Test essentially a pink-ball game with a twilight session, since the proposed 98 overs a day will not be feasible in the subcontinent.Maybe stakeholders should contemplate whether they are considering a change for the right reasons. A closer look will reveal that more Tests are finishing inside four days because there are more results and less draws. Is there an opportunity there? Also, if Tests are too long for millennials, would shaving just a day off help? Alternately, if Tests were free to air, would the ICC want four days of it or all five?",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73077995,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-218087,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/cricket/news/will-changing-the-five-day-test-format-pay-off-or-make-it-vulnerable-to-more-tinkering/articleshow/73077970.cms

LUCKNOW: Onion prices plunged from Rs 100-140/kg to Rs 50-80/kg on Thursday, following fresh supply from Maharashtra and Rajasthan, but vendors suspect the relief will be short-lived. The edible bulb, which was widely available for a maximum of Rs 60 a kilo in August, flaunted a Rs 100/kg price tag by December. In fact, on a couple of occasions last month, onions were as expensive as Rs 140/kg in some markets. As a result, daily sales dropped to just 50-60kg from 5-6 quintal earlier. Thursday’s pocket-friendly onion rates prompted a buybuy rush at all major mandis, including Nishatganj, Chowk, Narhi, Dandahiya, Bhootnath and Mithaiwala crossing.

“I bought 5kg at Rs 60 a kilo to last me a whole month because vendors warned that prices will go up again,” said Sukriti Shukla of Hazratganj .

The police said that the accused, Sunil Mundra, a resident of Lake Town, was running the betting racket on domestic T-20 matches being held in Australia. “We have recovered some evidence that led to the arrest of Mundra. We have registered a case under IPC sections pertaining to cheating and criminal conspiracy and sections 3 and 4 of West Bengal Gambling and Prize Competition Act. The case has been registered with Pragati Maidan police,” said joint CP (crime), Murlidhar Sharma.

Police said they were carrying out a separate probe on how some Indians staying outside the country are running an online betting racket on matches being played abroad. “The probe has reached an advanced stage,” said an officer. Sources said some 12 apps are being used to place bets and watch matches live while the money is transferred online. Many of the apps like betfair and bet365 are easily available as betting/gambling is legal in many countries.

File photo of Punjab’s tableau themed on folk dance ‘jago’ that was selected in 2017, after a gap of five year... Read More

CHANDIGARH: Punjab's tableau, themed around first Sikh master Guru Nanak Dev's teachings, has been selected for this year's Republic Day parade at New Delhi. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is the chief guest at this year's Republic Day function.

The state government had proposed the tableau on Guru Nanak Dev's teachings as the world is celebrating 550th birth anniversary of the first Sikh Guru. It will depict the spirit of 'Kirat karo, naam jappo, wannd chhako' (Work hard, remember god and share with needy).

Out of total 56 tableau proposals, the Union defence ministry has selected 22, after a series of five meetings. The selected tableaux include those proposed by 16 states and Union territories, besides six central ministries.

A senior official of the Punjab government said the central government had suggested some changes in the music to be played on the tableau and the state government was working on it. The selection committee, which includes experts from varied fields of music, art, sculpture, culture, painting, choreography and architecture, examines proposals on the basis of their theme, design, visual impact and other laid down criteria.

Punjab's tableau has been selected consecutively for the fourth year. It was in 2017, after a gap of five years, that Punjab's tableau themed on folk dance 'jago' was selected for the Republic Day parade. Thereafter, the state's tableau based on the theme 'sangat and pangat' (congregation and community kitchen) participated in 2018. Punjab's tableau that showcased history of Jallianwala Bagh won the third prize in the parade in 2019.

Since the selection process of tableaux is a time-consuming process, the Union ministry had in June last year invited proposals from all the states, Union territories and ministries by the end of August 2019. The central ministry had suggested six themes while inviting proposals for tableaux. These included any important episode from the history of state or union territory; festivals celebrated; cultural or architectural heritage, including any aspect of the life of people; any important social and economic development scheme, project or achievement of outstanding nature; and environment and vision for future.

153,['3/01/2020'],Gujarat: Manjula Pooja Shroff vouches for Nithyananda's 'hair removal with third eye',"This story is from January 3, 2020

A grab from the undated video.

AHMEDABAD: The video of an experience-sharing interaction of followers of controversial godman Nithyananda featuring the managing director and chief executive officer of Kalorex Group, Manjula Pooja Shroff , went viral on social media on Thursday. In the video, Shroff is seen showering praises on Nithyananda and his 'third-eye awakening'. She narrates her experiences of two power manifestations of ' Swami Nithyananda ' that she practised, one of which includes hair removal in a jiffy, 'through Swamiji's eyes'.

The time when the video was shot is not known and could not be independently verified by TOI. In the video, Shroff says, ""I practised two power manifestations this evening...One exercise I undertook was the removal of hair...We took a small patch... I was able to reduce through Swamiji's third eye, almost 50% of the density of the hair... The hair went much faster.""

Shroff has been currently given interim relief by the Gujarat high court till January 7, in a case relating to forging of a no-objection certificate (NOC) to obtain CBSE affiliation for Delhi Public School (DPS) East. The expose came on the heels of a major controversy erupting over Nithyananda's ashram inside the DPS (East) campus in Hirapur, Ahmedabad, from where two daughters of a Tamil Nadu-based man had allegedly gone 'missing'. Their father filed an FIR against the ashram leading to investigations which also brought the forgery to fore.

The video has caused her detractors suggest that Shroff had not just leased land to Nithyananda's ashram, but was also an ardent follower and advocate of his 'power manifestations'. Describing the other exercise, she said, ""I was given this picture. It was of a remote city called Buford. I was able to see the street and the distinctive feature was a sloping roof, a hut and it was a cold place - there was snow and a vast space. I had a real breakthrough in remote-sensing.""

Shroff is also seen describing her practise sessions for the said power manifestation. ""When I was practising in all-night sessions, I tried to zoom-in and see a bank of my partner. It is a remote bank in France and I was able to see and describe it and then I asked her for a confirmation. When my partner sent a picture of the bank and it was exactly the way I described it. That was a fantastic experience. It gave me tremendous confidence. And no matter how much confidence we do, it is Swamiji working through us. That was the biggest learning.""

In the video, Shroff is seen narrating her power manifestation experiences. Responding to a question on repercussions that such power manifestations hold for kids around the world, she said, ""If kids around the world had this kind of power, the teachers did not have to torture them as much as we do. (sic).""

158,['3/01/2020'],BS Yediyurappa lashes out at Centre for ignoring Karnataka’s flood woes,"This story is from January 3, 2020

BS Yediyurappa

TUMAKURU: In astonishing criticism at the Centre, chief minister BS Yediyurappa , in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a public function in Tumakuru on Thursday, openly expressed his displeasure over its indifference in releasing financial relief for flood victims of the state.

“I have personally drawn the attention of the Prime Minister on three or four occasions to the large-scale damage caused by floods in Karnataka ,” Yediyurappa said in Kannada at the event attended by PM Modi. “No additional assistance has reached the state till now. Today, I again request the PM to release relief funds immediately,” he said to huge applause from the gathering.

The chief minister was speaking at a function to release the third instalment of Rs 2,000 each to farmers under the Prime Minister Kisan Samman scheme and presentation of Krishi Karman awards in Tumakuru.

The CM went on to say he will send a delegation of ministers and the chief secretary to meet Modi at Raj Bhavan (where he stayed on Thursday night), to apprise the PM on the damage, relief and rehabilitation work that must be taken up and the support the state needs from the Centre.

Karnataka has pegged the loss due to floods at Rs 38,000 crore. The Centre released interim relief of Rs 1,200 crore under the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) after a big hue and cry and promised another Rs 1,600 crore.

Yediyurappa also urged the Centre to focus on a remunerative price for farm produce and water to irrigate fields. “When hit by natural calamities, farmers can manage on their own if the government ensured a remunerative price for produce and water for their fields,” Yediyurappa said. “The PM’s resolve of doubling farmers’ income by 2023 will remain a resolve if farmers do not get a scientific price for their produce.”

He also requested Modi for Rs 50,000 crore to complete irrigation projects pending for decades. Modi did not respond to Yediyurappa’s demands though the audience was curious to hear from him.

The Congress used Yediyurappa’s jibes to attack the PM. “You did not visit Karnataka when it was devastated by floods, you did not visit Karnataka when our farmers cried for help, but all of a sudden, when you want to launch your political propaganda, you remember the innocent people of Karnataka. Wah Modi Wah!!” Congress leader Siddaramaiah tweeted.

162,['3/01/2020'],Dream of joining Delhi Police crushed but not before 27-year-old saves three,"This story is from January 3, 2020

Amit Balyan

NEW DELHI: Amit Balyan , who was at the forefront of the firefighting operation at Peeragarhi, was one of the brightest men Delhi Fire Service (DFS) had inducted last year. Apart from basic training, the 27-year-old had also received search and rescue lessons. When the building came crashing down, Balyan stayed put to help a caretaker and two workers escape the blaze.

Fire officials said even after being trapped, Balyan kept relaying his location to his colleagues. However, he fell unconscious due to excessive bleeding and inhalation of smoke. His death has left his colleagues and family members in shock and despair.

The fireman’s father, Babu Ram, an assistant sub-inspector with Delhi Police posted at Anand Vihar police station, was inconsolable when informed about his son’s death. “He was my only working son. I can’t believe that he is gone at such a young age,” he said, with tears rolling down his cheeks.

Balyan was a huge support to his younger brother, who is still studying, and two married sisters. Family members said he had been trying to crack the Delhi Police exam. He had earlier cleared the Uttar Pradesh Police exam, but didn’t join the force as he wanted to be with his family in Delhi.

He had married Shivani, a UP Police constable posted in Ghaziabad, after a brief love affair in February last year. “We have told his wife that he has been admitted to the ICU. We are waiting for her to return from duty,” said a family member.

A resident of Meet Nagar in Loni, Balyan was inducted into DFS during a mass recruitment drive. He joined Kirti Nagar fire station as an operator last June. His family is originally from Shamli in Uttar Pradesh.

Harish, Balyan’s batchmate and friend, said, “We joined training on December 10, 2018. He was a jovial man and the life of our friends’ circle.”

Hence, it is absolutely important to attend to our emotional problems at the root level.EFT Tapping (Emotional Freedom Technique) is one such holistic healing therapy that can alternatively work in providing the solution to some of your problem.Also known as a form of 'psychological acupressure', this form of treatment relies on the power of tapping certain points on the body, create a power balance, to match all your energy levels, eliminate the negative energy points and pain as well.While the method is still under research, EFT has also been found to be rather helpful in treating mental health disorders like PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) and depression as well.EFT is a form of acupuncture which lays emphasis on pressing some sensitive points (also referred to as the meridian points) located in different places to restore the balance of the body. According to Chinese medicine, these power points act as powerful pathways that restore energy flow, maintain health and prevent imbalances.While traditional acupuncture relies on the usage of traditional needles, EFT uses the power of fingertip tapping to channelize the body's energy circles and relieve any stress or chronic pain, disease or even sickness which might have been caused by a negative or traumatic experience.According to experts, this tapping technique, in a very sensitive way, gives you access to the body's energy levels at the root and connects you to the nerves in the brain which control stress. When you do this, you are in control of the stress and negative experiences and relatively, in a better way to restore body balance.Since this technique involves the use of no tools or prior knowledge, EFT can be learned in a few simple steps and help get rid of negative energies in an effective manner. Once memorized, each round of it can be performed in about 30 seconds.First and foremost, you need to get in sync with your body and know what is troubling you, or the fear you have, which will direct you to the connecting tapping point. Make a mental note and make sure you target one issue at a time to harness the most benefits. It can range from any embarrassing situation, a traumatic statement, physical pain, injury or even stress.Now that you know the issue in hand, assign a number (between 1-10) to it, depending on the intensity of pain it brings. Remember, your goal is to bring the number down to the minimum and see the improvement. To do this, follow this technique:-If the issue brings you distress and you feel a tugging pain, assign a number accordingly.-Physical pain and ailment can be assigned a number, depending on your threshold.-If the problem is not letting you perform, number it, depending on how close/far you are to achieving it.After the numbering, now begins the tapping. Before you do this, start by practicing a positive affirmation, which goes like:""Despite (what your problem is), I accept myself and I am trying to change.Next, start by tapping specific points on the body, which are below mentioned, in an ascending manner:Eyebrow-Side of the eye-Under the eye-Under the nose-Chin-Tip of the collarbone and under the arm- Top of the Head.Follow this tapping routine, according to the sequence and keep repeating the affirmation. This will help you stay focused on reaching the goal.Now that you have completed the tapping sequence, go back to your root issue and now number the pain intensity you feel, comparing it with the older one.If you feel a difference, EFT tapping has helped you.

PANAJI: A day ahead of BJP’s mega rally in support of citizenship law to be addressed by party working president J P Nadda, four Congress’ functionaries of its Panaji unit came out in support of the citizenship amendment Act (CAA) with three of them joining the saffron party on Thursday.

Congress hurriedly dissolved its entire Panaji block and said a new committee would be constituted after discussing with the block members.

These Congressmen, who had participated in the anti-CAA agitation in Panaji last week, said they were quitting the party as it was misguiding people.

“We are resigning as we oppose the wrongful stand taken by the party on CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC),” Prasad Amonkar, who held the post of the Panaji block president, said.

The move comes nearly five months after 10 of the 15 Congress MLAs defected to BJP in July.

‘Workers were pressurised’

Amonkar along with North Goa general secretary Dinesh Kubbal, Shivraj Tarcar and Javed Sheikh also said they were fed up with the party’s style of functioning and described Congress as “haywire” and “directionless”.

Congress functionaries said BJP had pressurised its four members to quit to “demoralise the agitation against CAA”. One of the four said they had joined BJP because Congress had become “defunct” with just four-five individuals taking decisions for the party.

Amonkar made it clear that the move to the saffron camp was guided by Panaji legislator Atanasio Monserrate, who joined BJP after being elected on a Congress ticket.

“We support Monserrate, because he is pro-development and he is helping the people of Panaji,” Amonkar said.

The four rebel Congress members said that they would support BJP’s development agenda.

North Goa district Congress president Vijay Bhike said, “BJP hopes that our spirit and our agitation against NRC and CAA will die down. That is why after taking our legislators, they are touching our workers.”

Kalapani dispute

?

The MEA on Thursday clarified that India's political map released after reorganisation of J&K has in no manner revised the boundary with Nepal. The timing is significant, as it comes amid an unease with Nepal over territorial claims of the Kalapani trijuntion of India-Nepal-China. Nepal media has carried reports of a likely bilateral dialogue with India on Jan 15 over the issue.Kalapani is a 372-sq km area at the China-Nepal-India tri-junction. India claims Kalapani as a part of Uttarakhand while Nepal depicts the area in its map. The border dispute flared up again recently after India released its new political map, following the reorganisation of J&K, showing the area as its own.According to the Sugauli treaty signed between Nepal and British India in 1816, the Mahakali river that runs through the Kalapani area is the boundary between the two countries. However, British surveyors subsequently showed the origin of the river, which has many tributaries, at different places. While Nepal claims that the river west of the disputed territory is the main river and so Kalapani falls in its territory, India claims a different origin and includes the area in its territory.Strategically, Lipulekh Pass in Kalapani serves as an important vantage point for India to keep an eye on Chinese movements. Since 1962, Kalapani has been manned by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police.Nepal’s Supreme Court has this week sought the country’s original map exchanged with India during the signing of the Sugauli Treaty, the one exchanged while signing a boundary treaty with India in 1960, the map published by the East-India Company on February 1, 1827, and a separate map published by the British Government in 1847.Kalapani is such an emotive issue for Nepal and its citizens that India’s decision to expand trade with China through the Lipulekh Pass created a furore in Kathmandu with the Nepal Parliament seeking to know from the government if the India-China agreement undermined Nepal’s sovereignty.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73078425,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-58482,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/the-kalapani-dispute-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/73078440.cms
167,['3/01/2020'],Leaking manhole gives nightmares to Begur residents,"This story is from January 3, 2020

The entire locality stinks, but the authorities remain indifferent

BENGALURU: A manhole in Begur has been overflowing for 40 days now. With sewage flowing on neighbourhood roads, stench and fear of a disease outbreak pervade the air in the southeast Bengaluru locality.

With the civic agencies in charge of fixing the problem busy pointing fingers at each other, residents are clueless about where to go.

“We have written over a hundred emails to both the agencies — BWSSB and BBMP — to fix the sewage line and plug the manhole. But the agencies are paying no heed,” said Kiran N, a resident of Begur. With sewage all over the place, the entire locality stinks, but officials remain oblivious to the problem, he added.

Laxmikanth SR, a retired bank employee who lives in the same area, told TOI his grandson has been suffering from viral fever for one week and doctors are blaming it on the filthy water.

Narasimha K (name changed), a general physician who runs a clinic in Begur, said running sewage can cause many diseases, including viral flu, fever, cold and cough. “Sewage breeds certain bacteria and insects, which can lead to many health issues,” he added.

Ashwin Bhattar, an entomologist at district vectorborne disease control programme, Bengaluru Urban and other health workers visited Begur on Thursday and inspected the overflowing manhole.

“Residents need not fear the rise in incidence of dengue due to sewage overflow. Mosquitoes do not breed in dirty water ,” Bhatta said, adding: “But there are high chances of viral flu and common cold in the locality due to this issue.”

Bhattar said there is a high possibility of sewage increasing larvae breeding and this could be risky for residents. “We have sprayed certain chemicals which will kill the larvae and also prevent mosquito-breeding. Staff from the primary health centre and ASHA workers will do a survey of the locality to spread awareness about health issues arising out of a leaky drain,” Bhattar said.

A senior health official said they will write to BBMP and BWSSB to fix the problem immediately.

“The BBMP and BWSSB need to work in coordination and resolve the sewage issue,” the senior official said.

BENGALURU: With Prime Minister Narendra Modi on a two-day visit to Karnataka , a few citizen groups and civic activists have launched a campaign on social media asking the government to speed up the suburban rail project.

The 37-year-old project is stuck as the special purpose vehicle, which is likely to be christened Bengaluru Rail Infrastructure Development Enterprises (B-RIDE), is yet to be set up though the extended railway board (ERB) gave its nod in November. As part of the #ChukuBukuCabinetClearanceBeku campaign, citizen groups have sought the PM’s intervention, saying the project has not gained momentum despite BJP-led governments at the Centre and state.

Sources say the draft cabinet note for the project is now before the finance ministry. “It was supposed to be approved by the Centre by now but has been delayed due to some reasons. We hope the approval will be granted by this month-end,” said an official. Sources say Karnataka Rail Infrastructure Development Enterprises (K-RIDE), which is supposed to execute the project, recently launched its website (www.kride.in) and a new office will be set up at Samparka Soudha in Rajajinagar .

Deepika Kumari. (Getty Images)

NEW DELHI: India’s top recurve archers are distraught after being told to arrange for their own boarding and lodging in Pune where they have assembled to compete in a selection trial for the Tokyo Olympics qualifiers .

The three-day trials have been directed by the Delhi High Court-appointed five-member transitory committee. The committee has members from the sports ministry, Sports Authority of India (SAI), Indian Olympic Association ( IOA ) and the two suspended factions of the Archery Association of India (AAI).

The trials for both men and women recurve archers, scheduled to be held at the Army Sports Institute (ASI) Pune from January 4 to 6 will be attended by Olympians Deepika Kumari, Bombayla Devi and Atanu Das among others. The archers are also upset about the fact that while they and accompanying coaches/officials have been asked to foot their own bills, the transitory committee has surprisingly cleared the trip of selection committee members at the government’s cost. “Travelling (to and fro economy class air fare), boarding and lodging would be provided as per norms,” read a recent circular issued by the committee.

TOI spoke to some of the archers, who said they have been finding it difficult to book an accommodation as most of the good hotels are situated far off from the ASI. “Imagine you have a trial coming up for the Olympic qualifier, but are told to arrange for your own boarding and lodging rather than focus on training. As per the norms, it’s the duty of the federation (in this case the SAI since the AAI is suspended) to arrange for boarding and lodging since it’s a trial connected to Olympic qualification. When a selection trial was conducted in Sonepat in August last year, the boarding and lodging was taken care of by SAI. So, what has happened this time?” asked an archer.

An ASI official, who deals with the residential wing, informed TOI that no booking order for stay of men’s recurve archers was received from the SAI till Friday. However, when TOI contacted a transitory committee member, he assured that the accommodation will be provided to the participating archers after the first day of trial, when the numbers of competing archers will drop following their elimination, and there will be a fewer archers to accommodate in ASI. Later, the same official added that the arrangements have been made for accommodation. The archers are yet to be notified about it. “No such information has reached us. We are still searching for hotels,” an archer said.

The ASI doesn’t have any residential facility for women athletes. It only allows male athletes which only raises a question: Where will the women stay if accommodation is arranged at ASI?

The complaint alleged that the accused had forged the signature of Arjun Mahadev Vazarkar for a mutation process that was completed in 2017. The property lies in survey number 404/1 and measures close to 8,000sqm, the FIR registered in Porvorim police station has stated.

Agnelo C Lobo, then attorney of the Serula comunidade, has also been named in the FIR for allegedly issuing an NOC to do the mutation sans verification. The accused succeeded in deleting Vazarkar’s name and adding theirs as owners in revenue records, the FIR has stated.

The complaint was filed three months ago by comunidade president Alex V A D’Souza and others. The accused face charges under IPC sections 419 (cheating), 465 (punishment for forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable document) 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine forged document) read with Section 34.

UDAIPUR: A tigress was mauled to death by a tiger that barged into her enclosure at the Sajjangarh Zoological Park in Udaipur on Thursday afternoon .

Damini, the 13-year-old tigress, was one of the major attractions at the zoo ever since she was brought here from Pune. The male tiger, Kumar, had been brought later from Karnataka and both the big cats were kept in separate enclosures adjacently.

The male tiger that crept into Damini’s cage attacked her perhaps because she was not receptive of his approaches. The struggle between the big cats was witnessed by many visitors who were around the area at the moment.

Big cats introductions can be perilous even if they are kept in adjacent close enclosures where they can see, smell and react to each other, experts said.

“A male tiger is very powerful and it takes only minutes for it to maul the female if she isn’t in the oestrus cycle (the period in the sexual cycle of female mammals). Perhaps this would have been the case with Damini, which was killed by Kumar. This is the first case where any male animal has killed a female partner. Whether it is negligence on the part of the caretakers at the park or the substandard material of the fencing that the tiger found a way to enter Damini’s enclosure, would only be known after a detailed investigation,” Rahul Bhatnagar, retired CCF said.

None of the authorities from the forest department were available for a comment.

174,['3/01/2020'],'It's exceptional': Liverpool sink Blades to make it a year unbeaten,"This story is from January 3, 2020

Liverpool, Jan 3 (AFP) Jurgen Klopp hailed ""exceptional"" Liverpool after they made it an entire calendar year without a Premier League defeat as the runaway leaders beat Sheffield United 2-0 on Thursday. Klopp's side moved 13 points clear of second placed Leicester thanks to goals from Egypt forward Mohamed Salah and Senegal winger Sadio Mane at Anfield. Liverpool's 19th win in 20 league games this season completed an incredible 12 months for a team at the peak of their powers. The Reds haven't lost in 37 league games since a defeat at Manchester City on January 3, 2019 and it looks certain they will win the English title for the first time since 1990. With a game in hand to further bolster their advantage, it would take an astonishing collapse to deprive Liverpool of their holy grail. ""It says a lot of positive things. I have not enough words for it, it is exceptional,"" Klopp said. ""I'm really happy and really proud of the boys. We should not take things like this for granted."" Winners of their last 18 home league games, Liverpool are unbeaten in 51 top-flight matches at Anfield dating back to April 2017. As if it wasn't hard enough to beat Liverpool already, they are proving more impregnable than ever lately. This was their fifth consecutive top-flight clean-sheet -- the first time they have managed that since 2007 -- and they completed more passes than any team in one match in the Premier League era. ""The way we controlled Sheffield United was exceptional. In possession we were incredible, we were calm but lively as well. The goals we scored were exceptional,"" Klopp said. ""It's obviously good (to go unbeaten for a year) but the target was not to extend this, but to win the game. ""We did not think about the one year (undefeated). We have season resolutions, not New Year resolutions!"" After a golden 2019 saw Liverpool crowned European and Club World champions, the next target is ending Manchester City's two-year spell as champions after narrowly missing out last season. Their sights set on domestic bliss, the new year started just as the old one finished, with Liverpool setting standards of excellence that rival anything achieved by City's breath-taking team. Premier League immortality is within touching distance as Klopp's men are already over halfway towards an unbeaten league season that would replicate the incredible feat of Arsenal's 2003-04 Invincibles. Liverpool hadn't even kicked off when they suffered what could have been a distracting blow as Naby Keita was replaced by James Milner after being injured in the warm-up. But the Reds are far too polished to lose focus and they were in front within four minutes. - Flushed with success - ======================== Their win at Bramall Lane in September had come thanks to a mistake from United keeper Dean Henderson and once again Liverpool benefitted from a Blades blunder. When Virgil van Dijk played a long pass towards Andrew Robertson, it should have been easy for George Baldock to deal with. But Baldock lost his footing and fell over, allowing Robertson to advance and cross low to Salah, who got in front of Jack O'Connell to steer in a clinical close-range finish for his 14th goal of the season. Ahead of their first visit to Anfield for 13 year, Chris Wilder's down-to-earth side took the unusual decision to train alongside the public on Stanley Park in the shadow of the famous stadium. The session was interrupted when a dog decided to use one of the training cones as a toilet. That unpromising omen proved apt as the visitors' hopes of a shock result were flushed away. Liverpool's ability to press any opponent into submission and deliver the knockout blow with their lethal front three has made them virtually unplayable over the last 18 months. United were the latest victims as Mane wrapped up the points in the 64th minute. Running onto Robertson's pass, Mane broke into the area and took Salah's return pass before firing gleefully into the roof of the net after his initial shot was saved.

Sydney, Jan 3 (AFP) Australian organisers for the new tennis team championship were left red-faced on Friday by playing the wrong national anthem for a player from Moldova, a small landlocked country in eastern Europe. The embarrassing gaffe occurred ahead of the opening singles tie in Sydney of the ATP Cup between Moldova's Alexander Cozbinov and Belgium's Steve Darcis. ""At the start of the Moldova v Belgium match we mistakenly played the wrong national anthem for Moldova,"" the ATP admitted. ""We are sincerely sorry and have apologised personally to Team Moldova."" Tournament officials told AFP the Romanian anthem was played instead. Moldova, bordered by Romania and Ukraine, was one of the last countries to qualify for the inaugural team event being played in Sydney, Brisbane and Perth. They are spearheaded by world number 46 Radu Albot, who broke new ground in 2019 by becoming his country's first ATP Tour title winner at Delray Beach. He is joined by Cozbinov, ranked 818, Egor Matvievici and Dmitrii Baskov in a group that also features Britain, Belgium and Bulgaria. The ATP Cup has 24 nations split into six groups across the three cities, with eight teams emerging from the round-robin to compete in a knockout phase in Sydney until one country is left standing.

File photo used for representational purpose

LUCKNOW: Students appearing for class X and XII exams of UP Secondary Education Board ( UPSEB ) will not be forced to take out shoes and socks. Instead, checking would be done at the entrance of exam centres.

In 2019, in the absence of official order, there were complaints of invigilators compelling students to take out shoes in a bid to be extra cautious. The matter was also raised in the Assembly on February 14.

In a review meet, chief secretary RK Tiwari directed Board officials and all DIOS to ensure students are not put to discomfort by taking out their shoes while writing exams. Instead, they should be checked at the entrance of centre itself. He also instructed banning of loudspeakers near centres. Section 144 would also be promulgated near exam centres to ban assembly of people.

“The government has taken adequate measures like CCTV, webcasting, STF deployment, colour coding of answersheets to check copying so centre superintendents and invigilators need not take extreme steps unless directed. Last year, the students were put to discomfort by some centre superintendents,” said Shivlal, additional secretary, UPSEB after the Wednesday meet.

The centres in sensitive districts would be monitored by STF for the second consecutive year. Emphasis would be given to sensitive districts, including Aligarh, Rampur, Mathura, Muzaffarnagar, Ballia, Ghazipur, Pratapgarh, Mainpuri, Gonda, Balrampur, Hardoi, Kaushambi, Jaunpur, Hathras and Etah.

This year, 56.01 lakh students would be appearing in HS and Inter exams beginning simultaneously on February 18. They would end by March 6 and results are likely by April 25.

Sydney, Jan 3 (AFP) Nick Kyrgios has pledged Aus$200 (US$140) for each ace he serves across the Australian summer of tennis to support victims of bushfires raging around the country, with the ATP Cup Friday also promising help. The temperamental Australian, a controversial figure in the sport with a bad boy reputation, has been at the forefront of rallying support among players to help. ""I'm kicking off the support for those affected by the fires. I'll be donating $200 per ace that I hit across all the events I play this summer,"" tweeted the 24-year-old, who was handed a 16-week suspended ban in September after a series of outbursts. His Australian teammate at the inaugural ATP Cup Alex de Minaur went one better. ""I like this, I will go $250 per ace, just because I don't think I'll be hitting as many aces as you mate,"" he replied. The blazes have claimed 18 lives and forced mass evacuations, with the country bracing for a weekend heatwave expected to fan the deadly infernos. Kyrgios, who will also play the Kooyong Classic and the Australian Open Grand Slam this month, on Thursday issued a call for fundraisers for victims of the fires, which prompted Australia's tennis chief Craig Tiley to get on board. ""We want to help these communities in a meaningful way and will announce a number of fund raising and support initiatives that will be rolled out across the ATP Cup, Australian Open and our other events over the coming weeks,"" said Tiley. The fires have been a big talking point ahead of the 24-team ATP Cup, which gets underway Friday in Brisbane, Perth and Sydney with top names including Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal playing. Tournament director Tom Larner announced that each ace served at the 10-day event would deliver Aus$100 to bushfire relief. The initiative is forecast to raise around Aus$150,000, with more than 1,500 aces expected to sent down over the duration of the January 3-12 tournament. ""Communities across the whole country have been devastated by the bushfire crisis and at this time of the year, with our events in full swing, tennis has a unique opportunity to support the relief and recovery efforts,"" he said. ""Most of the players are already keen to score aces and win a quick point, and having the chance to raise money for the bushfire appeal will give them that extra bit of motivation."" ATP Cup officials will be relying on on-site medical experts to monitor air quality in Sydney, where cricket and golf events have been affected by haze from the fires in recent weeks.

179,['3/01/2020'],Premier League clubs set to splash out in January sales,"This story is from January 3, 2020

London, Jan 3 (AFP) The Premier League's January sales are open for business as clubs rush to snap up new year bargains in the one-month transfer window. Liverpool are running away with the title race and have already signed Japanese star Takumi Minamino, so the Reds are likely to sit out the frenzy while the chasing pack try to make the additions that could help them close the gap. Here, AFP Sport looks at the key transfer issues to address for the teams hoping to hang onto Liverpool's coat-tails: Chelsea ======= Chelsea boss Frank Lampard is expected to make a big splash after being unable to sign players in the summer window due to the club's transfer ban. With that two-window suspension halved by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, Lampard needs several new recruits to help accelerate the development of his promising young team. Armed with a reported �150 million transfer war-chest, Lampard will look to improve at left-back, where Emerson and Marcos Alonso have been too inconsistent. The Blues have already been linked with Leicester's Ben Chilwell to fill that role, but Lampard might not be satisfied with only one signing. Having constantly bemoaned Chelsea's lack of cutting edge against defensive opponents, the Chelsea boss needs pace on the flanks, a clinical finisher to dove-tail with Tammy Abraham and, ideally, a creative midfielder. Crystal Palace forward Wilfried Zaha, Leipzig striker Timo Werner and Lyon forward Moussa Dembele are among Lampard's mooted targets. Manchester United ================= Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has revealed Manchester United are ""looking at one or two"" players after learning Paul Pogba will be absent for the next month. France midfielder Pogba has been advised to undergo surgery on his ankle and that is a problem for United manager Solskjaer, who is already without Scott McTominay due to a knee injury. ""Of course it is playing on our decision making when we have two players out - Paul for a month and Scott for two,"" Solskjaer said. ""If it's available and if it's possible we will do something, definitely."" Solskjaer missed out on promising striker Erling Braut Haaland, who has signed for Borussia Dortmund from Red Bull Salzburg. Aston Villa midfielder Jack Grealish, Leicester duo Ricardo Pereira and James Maddison, as well as Dortmund's Jadon Sancho have all seen their names connected to Old Trafford. Arsenal ======= Mikel Arteta admits Arsenal could be more active than expected after Calum Chambers had surgery on a knee injury that will rule him out for a lengthy period. It leaves new Gunners boss Arteta short of options in defence and he will meet with technical director Edu and head of football Raul Sanllehi this week to mull over their plans. ""We will try to be in the market to see options that can strengthen the team, that's for sure and our obligation and we will be working on that,"" Arteta said. ""My obligation is to give my opinion on the things we can improve. Obviously we have a bad injury with Calum a few days ago that will change our plans at the back."" Arteta, who must also focus on persuading Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to extend a contract which expires at the end of next season, has been linked with bids for Leicester midfielder Wilfred Ndidi, Atletico Madrid winger Thomas Lemar and Leipzig defender Dayot Upamecano. Tottenham, Manchester City and Leicester could be cautious shoppers ===================================================== Manchester City are trailing 11 points behind Liverpool, so a January spree might not be worthwhile for the champions. Pep Guardiola insists City will not rush into the January market because the quality of player available is generally not as high as in the summer window. But City did sign Aymeric Laporte in the 2018 winter market, so a surprise swoop isn't out of the question, especially if the signing can help in Guardiola's quest to win the Champions League for the first time since 2011. For Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho, the future of unsettled playmaker Christian Eriksen needs resolving as the Dane nears the end of his contract. While Eriksen is seemingly on the way out, Mourinho must focus on defensive reinforcements and Napoli's Elseid Hysaj, Marseille's Hiroki Sakai, Bournemouth's Nathan Ake and West Ham's Issa Diop are said to be on his shopping list. With second placed Leicester flying high, Brendan Rodgers maintains nobody will be leaving despite plenty of interest in his talented squad. Rodgers is on the lookout for fresh faces, with Juventus defender Merih Demiral and AC Milan's Hakan Calhanoglu potential targets.

PANAJI: The start of the new year is set to bring tears of joy as the rate of onions per kg fell to Rs 67 at the state-run horticulture outlets. In the retail market, onions came down by Rs 20, selling at Rs 80 per kg.“Now, there will be a trend of regular decrease in prices. The rates will further fall by the next week and the prices of onions at the outlets runs by the Goa State Horticulture Corporation Limited (GSHCL) will normalise between January 15 to 20,” said the corporation’s managing director, Sandeep Faldesai.Though there was a drastic drop of Rs 20 within a day, vegetable vendors in the retail market said that the prices of onions will stabilise only in the third week of January. “Onions are down to Rs 80 per kg on January 2 as opposed to Rs 100 on January1. The rates are likely to fall in the coming days, but this will be a slow process.” a vendor said.After being at an all-time high for the past two months, the price of this basic kitchen commodity was expected to come down this month following the winter harvest of the horticulture crop, expected to hit the markets by mid-January. Until then, onions are being imported from Turkey into the country to tackle the shortage.Vegetable vendors in the Panaji municipal market had been selling Turkish onions at a price that was Rs 20-30 higher as compared to the Indian variant. On Thursday, however, the prices of the two varieties were found to be the same.“The Turkish onions have not been taken too well by the average Indian consumer since they are very spicy. Their lack of popularity therefore, brought the rates down, selling at Rs 80 per kg,” onion seller, Aladdin Shaikh said.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73078609,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-222702,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-onions-down-by-rs-20-per-kg-sell-at-rs-80-per-kg-in-retail-market/articleshow/73078596.cms
182,['3/01/2020'],FA Cup underdogs seek their moment in the sun,"This story is from January 3, 2020

London, Jan 3 (AFP) Holders Manchester City get their FA Cup campaign underway on Saturday with their third round home tie against fourth-tier Port Vale. The eye-catching clash of the round, where all fixtures start a minute late to highlight a mental health campaign, is Sunday's Merseyside derby as runaway Premier League leaders Liverpool host Everton, who have shown a noticeable improvement since Carlo Ancelotti took over. However, the dreamers who hold onto the idea of the 'romance of the cup' will be hopeful of giantkilling exploits by the underdogs and here AFP Sport picks out three matches to justify the tag: Sheffield United (Premier League) v Fylde (National League) -- Sunday (1401GMT kick-off) The non-league team have quite a task travelling to take on the Blades who are acquitting themselves well back in the top tier. The 'Coasters' have beaten fellow non-league outfits Nantwich and Kingstonian in the previous rounds to reach this stage of the competition for the first time but this is a huge step up for the side in the relegation zone of the fifth tier of English football. However, United lost to another National League side Barnet last season at the same stage. Several of the squad including defender Andy Taylor will be familiar with the hosts having played for them. Taylor, who was a United regular in the Championship in 2009 but failed to win back his place after 14 months out with a serious injury, says they travel with belief they can pull off a major shock. ""It's one I look back on with great fondness, playing at that level in a great stadium. There's always an upset, so you never know, we'll be confident, positive and will give a good account of ourselves,"" said the 33-year-old. Rochdale (League One) v Newcastle United (Premier League) -- Saturday (1231GMT kick-off) Rochdale may be a lowly 18th in the third tier but based on their recent FA Cup record compared to Newcastle's they can entertain genuine hopes of claiming a major scalp. Rochdale have reached the fourth round of the competition in four of the last six seasons which is one more than Newcastle have. The Magpies travel to Rochdale with their morale at a low ebb following a 3-0 home hammering by Leicester which was their fourth defeat in five matches. Adding to manager Steve Bruce's problems is an injury crisis. Four players including captain and most impressive performer this term Jonjo Shelvey went off during the Leicester defeat taking their total of injured personnel to 11. Rochdale's young Irish manager Brian Barry-Murphy has been praised for his side's style of play and victory over the old campaigner Bruce could attract more high profile clubs to the 41-year-old's qualities. The pressure is on Bruce to secure a morale boosting and much-needed win. ""We have had a bad week. We have to put it right and get ready for the FA Cup at the weekend,"" he said. Gillingham (League One) v West Ham United (Premier League) -- Sunday (18:16GMT kick-off) The Gills are just three points off the play-off places and have an imposing recent home run under the experienced Steve Evans -- seven wins and a draw in their last eight matches at Priestfield Stadium. Giving the hosts extra hope of an upset is that the Hammers have been beaten by lower league opposition in cup competitions both last season -- AFC Wimbledon humbling them 4-2 in the FA Cup -- and this term, losing 4-0 to Oxford United in the League Cup. However, the London side go into the tricky tie on the back of a 4-0 thrashing of fellow Premier League strugglers Bournemouth in David Moyes's first match of his second spell. Who comes out on top may depend on whether Moyes picks a first choice team or keeps them fresh for their next league game on Friday week away at Sheffield United.

NEW DELHI: In the Hollywood movie Inferno, Tom Hanks is seen being hotly pursued by the Italian Police who are using a drone to track him and Felicity Jones through the streets of Florence. If all goes well, Delhi Police can soon follow suit for chase sequences in real life.Delhi Police, TOI has learnt, is procuring unmanned aerial vehicles aka drones, which will be used in crime control and to manage law and order situations.Police commissioner Amulya Patnaik has given his nod for the initial procurement of two UAVs, which will be allotted to the mobile control room. There are plans to buy more drones for different units, sources said. These devices will be compliant with the norms specified by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation.The capital’s police force is the first in the country to procure these devices. Currently, Delhi Police hires drones on a need-to-use basis.Cops in many countries have turned to drones to help snare criminal gangs. In 2015, Scotland Yard started using a fleet of drones to track, chase and nab street criminals involved in drive-by snatches. In the United States, drones are used in several states by police and FBI for chase and surveillance. In 2014, Italian Police announced its plans of using drones to monitor major events and to respond to natural disasters and protests.In Delhi, the crime management can substantially improve with the induction of drones as this will not only help avoid fatal collisions during high-speed pursuits, but also keep a watch on crimeprone neighbourhoods. UAVs can also be of great help in monitoring crowds, given the large number of protests and demonstrations held in the city every year.Drones have, in fact, saved the day for Delhi Police on many occasions in the last five years. Police experimented with UAVs way back in 2014 during the Trilokpuri riots. “More than the violence on the ground, we were having a tough time containing stone-pelters hiding on rooftops. The police brass came up with a plan to use drones. Two devices equipped with high-quality cameras were brought in for use over the next few hours,” recalled an officer.As the UAVs took flight, the game changed. In no time, police had the upper hand as they ascertained the specific terraces where Molotov cocktails, stones and bricks were hidden. It also gave the cops precise location of rioters. Even in the recent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act in areas like central Delhi, Jamia Nagar and Seelampur, police used drones to film rioters.Indian laws permit recreational use of toy drones, like helicopters with limited frequency, but police have banned the use of advanced drones by individuals in the wake of threats and alerts from terrorist organisations. There is also the fear of drones falling into wrong hands. “There are chances of its being hacked. A drone can also be spiked with explosives and used by terror outfits. We fear its misuse but if done with proper planning, drones can change the way we police Delhi,” an officer said.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73078678,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-421996,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-its-a-bird-its-a-plane-its-cops-eye-in-the-sky/articleshow/73078537.cms

186,['3/01/2020'],Ranji Trophy: Struggling Mumbai will hope to turn things around against dominant Karnataka,"This story is from January 3, 2020

MUMBAI: Two of domestic cricket ’s powerhouses — Mumbai and Karnataka — clash at MCA’s Bandra Kurla Complex Ground in a key league match of the Ranji Trophy starting today.

And although the game will feature the likes of Ajinkya Rahane and Prithvi Shaw for the home side, and Karun Nair and Abhimanyu Mithun for the visitors, it’s hard not to take note of the players who will not be available for the fixture owing to India commitments.

While a full strength Mumbai side would definitely have included Rohit Sharma, Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube and Shardul Thakur, Karnataka would have been mightily boosted by the availability of Mayank Agarwal , KL Rahul and Manish Pandey.

Nevertheless, as experts would concur, their absence gives those waiting in the wings a golden opportunity to leave their imprint on the encounter and add to the lore of Mumbai-Karnataka clashes. Although both teams have featured in some of Ranji Trophy’s most famous games down the decades, their recent meetings have seen Karnataka dominate proceedings in some style.

They have beaten the 41-time champions outright thrice and claimed first innings honours on two occasions. On the other hand, Mumbai have had to largely lick their wounds and settled for a solitary first innings lead in the 2014-15 season.

9am start adds to challenge

Unlike their previous matches this season that started at 9.30am both teams will be out in the centre at 9am to ensure that sharp drop in visibility in the post tea session does not hamper proceedings. Given the current wintry conditions, requests were made by officials for an early start and both camps agreed.

While Mumbai beat Baroda away from home in their season opener and were humbled by Railways at the Wankhede Stadium last week, Karnataka beat Tamil Nadu and claimed first innings bragging rights against Uttar Pradesh in their first two games. They played Himachal Pradesh last week and ended up trailing on account of the first innings. These results mean both teams will be nudged to go for an outright win and climb up the combined Elite Group A and B tables and ensure they are in the mix for a quarterfinal spot.

Mumbai, especially, would like to make the most of the presence of skipper Suryakumar Yadav, Rahane and Shaw as after the game, the trio will be departing for New Zealand to fulfil their national commitments. They will also have to rejig their batting order after leaving out opener Jay Bista and in all likelihood, wicketkeeper Aditya Tare would be partnering the charismatic Shaw at the top of the order.

Kadam set for Ranji debut

On the other hand, Karnataka are yet to come to terms with the absence of off-spinner Krishnappa Gowtham, who took a match haul of 14 wickets against Tamil Nadu, but sadly ended up aggravating his right-foot toe injury during the match. The game at BKC could see middle-order batsman Rohan Kadam make his Ranji Trophy debut. The 25-year-old played a key role in Karnataka’s win in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy and the Vijay Hazare Trophy earlier this season.

As the news spread, students were seen distributing sweets and dancing to the tunes of dhol on campus.One could even spot some students playing with colours.Hangloo, who had been in the eye of storm over a series of controversies since the past three years, was summoned by National Commission for Women (NCW) earlier in December over allegations of improper handling of sexual harassment complaints and lack of a grievance cell for redress al of such charges. In December first week, a five-member team of NCW members had also visited the Women's Hostel to probe allegations of security lapses.AU Students' Union's former president Richa Singh said, ""It's a moral victory for AU students. Apart from Hangloo's resignation, we had been demanding that a detailed investigation be carried out into financial irregularities and sexual harassment complaints reported during his tenure.""Singh and his supporters had been protesting for 20 days outside the gate of AU's Women's Hostel against the alleged lapses in inmates' security, until she was arrested on Sunday for defying prohibitory orders as section 144 was imposed across the state.The Samajwadi Party (SP) leader also claimed that inmates of Women's Hostel had been protesting against VC since the past two weeks and had even not celebrated the New Year on Wednesday. The inmates wore black on New Year's Day as a mark of protest.""Hangloo was forced to resign as he had been accused of seeking sexual favours from a woman in exchange for a job and protecting those accused of sexual harassment in the university,"" she added.Singh was referring to the leaked recordings of calls between Hangloo and a Delhi-based woman in 2018, wherein the former promised her a job using his influences.""AU students are relieved with the VC's resignation as they had been fighting for a safe campus for long. The resignation would set an example for others. In the past four years, the former VC had not only forced authorities to lodge FIRs against several students, but also expelled more than 100 students.""She also alleged that Hangloo had tried to get her Ph.D registration cancelled and also threatened her of dire consequences through his supporters men several times. ""I was threatened not to raise my voice against the VC, who was also accused of financial irregularities and nepotism in recruitment of faculty members,"" said the former AUSU president.Student leader RS Yadav said, ""Students from different outfits like Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, Yuvjan Sabha and National Students' Union of India fought together for the rights of students by joining their hands under the Sanyukt Sangrash Samiti. It was the first time in the history of AU when students with different ideologies came together on a common platform demanding the VC's resignation.""Jitesh Mishra, who is an NSUI member, said, ""Students were happy to know about the VC's resignation. The authorities had suppressed the voice of students for long during the tenure of Prof Hangloo.""Sanyukt Sangharsh Samiti, an umbrella outfit with different student wings as its members, demanded that AU authorities fulfil their eight demands which included construction of a students' union hall, disposal of grievances related to sexual harassment complaints, regularisation of seminars and sports and withdrawal of FIRs against students.The student leaders claimed that the former VC often tried to suppress the voice of students, especially after the students council replaced the students' union.A senior AU official said, ""There was tremendous pressure on AU and some outsiders were trying to influence internal decisions. The academic atmosphere of the varsity was crippled. The teaching and non-teaching staff were surprised over the development and would urge the ministry of human resources development to reappoint him.""",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73078704,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1463162,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/education/news/students-on-au-vcs-resignation-its-a-moral-victory/articleshow/73078691.cms

The state could not satisfy the screening committee with its proposal ‘on art and architecture of Kerala’

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Centre has rejected state’s application for parading its tableau in Republic Day parade for second consecutive year.

The state’s proposed theme for the tableau was “art and architecture of the state”. In the tractor portion in the front, the display is state’s traditional festival, the state’s official animal, the elephant, and on both sides, boats carrying spices and other paraphernalia of Ayurveda are part of the tableau.

On the trailer portion of the tableau is Koothambalam — model of state’s architecture — along with performing arts of the state, including Mohiniyattam, Kalaripayattu and Theyyam in the background of Chenda, the traditional drum. The side portions carry Kathakali, Padayani, Koodiyattam and Ottan Thullal on boats floating in backwater.

Top government sources said the state tried its best to be selected this year after losing it last year, but could not satisfy the screening committee constituted for the purpose by the ministry of defence. “We went till the third stage of the screening and thereafter, we weren’t called for the fourth stage. We tried to rectify all the shortcomings pointed out by the committee, but lost out. This is the second time in a row that we have not been selected,” a top official said.

As per the guidelines for the preparation of tableau for 2020, any important event from the history of the state, festivals celebrated, architecture of the state, any important social and development scheme or achievement, environment or any vision for future can be represented. The proposals are scrutinised by the committee, and necessary changes and shortcomings are suggested. Once the sketches are approved, a three-dimensional model has to be submitted before the committee.

Last year, the state had selected and proposed ‘Vaikom Satyagraha’ as the theme for tableau. Vaikom Satyagraha was a historic social protest held in the state at the Siva temple at Vaikom in Kottayam against untouchability in Hindu society in 1924-25.

ALAPPUZHA: BJP national executive committee member P K Krishnadas called Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan 'Modern Jinnah' for moving a resolution in the state assembly demanding the scrapping of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

Speaking to reporters here on Thursday, he said passing of resolution in the assembly was part of a move by the state government to make Kerala a separate country.

""The resolution presented by the CM in the assembly is equal to that of the resolution presented by Muhammad Ali Jinnah for partition. The chief minister should gain legal literacy.

If Pinarayi Vijayan is sticking to his stand, he should ask chief secretary to issue the statements in this regard. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala is dancing to the tune of Pinarayi Vijayan. So, the state ministry should be reorganised by giving deputy CM post to Ramesh Chennithala. O Rajagopal, who spoke against the resolution in the assembly, should be deployed as the opposition leader,"" he said.

Krishnadas alleged that Pinarayi had a role behind all the protest against governor. ""At present, a person in a constitutional post is not able to enter the state. Those who acted against UAPA later executed it. The same thing will happen in the execution of CAA. The present activities of the government are a gimmick for diverting the attention of the people,"" he said.

MUMBAI: Following the Kerala legislative assembly’s resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), leaders of the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi in Maharashtra will meet soon to decide if such a resolution could be passed in the next session of the state assembly.

Cabinet member and NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said that since the state government comprises three parties, the proposal would have to be discussed at a joint meeting of senior leaders of the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena. “Any proposal would have to be discussed in the meeting so that consensus is secured,” Malik told TOI.

Deputy CM Ajit Pawar said heads of all three political parties have already opposed the CAA. “The NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena have opposed the proposal on the floor of the House. Any further decision will be taken by the leadership of the parties,” Pawar said.

The Congress and NCP had opposed the CAA as “unconstitutional” in the Lok Sabha, while the Shiv Sena had voted in favour of it in the Lower House. The Shiv Sena staged a walkout when the proposal was moved in the Rajya Sabha later.

Ex-minister has sought spl session

Former minister Naseem Khan of the Congress had last week written to state Congress president and cabinet minister Balasaheb Thorat, saying that a special session of the state legislature should be convened for passing a resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act. On the Congress’s foundation day on December 28, Thorat had declared that the new legislation would not be implemented in Maharashtra. Thorat and many other Congess leaders had that day carried out a rally from August Kranti Maidan to Girgaum Chowpatty to protest agains the legislation and to oppose its implementaion on the grounds that the Act was unfair.

The Sena had earlier said the Centre had failed to clarify certain points about the legislators such as how many refugees would be accommodated and where.

JAIPUR: The MGNREGA workers in Rajasthan may start getting wage/pay slips for working under the scheme. In a bid to empower the labourers, the state's MGNREGA department is mulling over introducing wage slips which will be issued to them as a proof of employment.

If Rajasthan introduces wage slips for MGNREGA workers, it will be the first state in the country to do it. ""The person, who is working under the scheme, must know how much wage he/she has earned. We can make that provision for the MGNREGA workers. But, it requires planning and an action plan has to be worked out for this to become a reality. This is a new idea that we wish to execute,"" said state's MGNREGA commissioner P C Kishan .

""With this inititative, the labourers will be empowered. Apart from this, we also have to ensure that 50 per cent of the mates working at the sites are women. Currently, their percentage is just 30%. Wherever self-help groups (SHGs) are strong, those areas should have 100% female mates,"" he added.

Calling it a positive move, social activist Nikhil Dey said, ""The central government's order on this (wage slips) already exists. The state government should be doing this and it must be done. It will help in transparency and cutting down corruption. So, it is an important step.""

197,['3/01/2020'],Doing well for state my only target: Karun Nair,"This story is from January 3, 2020

Karun Nair. (Getty Images)

MUMBAI: It’s a pointer to the batting riches that India possesses today that even a batsman of Karun Nair’s calibre can’t make his way to the national side. Nair made his First Class debut in the 2013-14 season and caught the eye straight away, hitting three centuries in the Ranji Trophy as Karnataka won the title.

The following season, Nair hit a triple century in the Ranji final against Tamil Nadu, batting at No. 6 and earning an India call up was just a matter of time. He did not disappoint when the chance came his way in 2016, hitting a triple century (303*) in the final Test of the India-England series in Chennai, having made his Test debut earlier in Mohali.

But things did not pan out the way it should have after such a promising start with Nair playing the last of his six Tests way back in March 2017 against Australia. While he remained in the squad of 16 whenever India toured abroad, he missed the playing XI. Sadly, for him, when there were injuries to other players, the team management mysteriously summoned others who were not even in the squad. Hanuma Vihari travelled to England from India after India lost at Lord’s and the team management sent Dinesh Karthik and Murali Vijay back home.

Nevertheless, the 28-year-old continues to hold sway at the domestic level and is a key cog in Karnataka’s wheel.

He will be leading his side against Mumbai in a key Ranji Trophy game starting today at the MCA’s BKC ground and all that he’s focused on at the moment is a good showing for Karnataka.

“For me, it is about playing each game at a time and trying to contribute as much as I can to Karnataka and trying to win games for the team. I am looking forward to contributing more with the bat and as captain, so that we can go on and win games,” Nair said on Thursday, post his team’s net session.

So does he have any other target in mind at the moment, considering that batsmen are generally at their peak in their late 20s? “Not really, because it is important for me to first concentrate on what’s happening over here and whatever has to happen, I have no control over it. So my only focus is to doing well here and contributing for Karnataka,” he said.

198,['3/01/2020'],"Mumbai: 21 years after they brought home baby, guardians get adoptive parents status","Representative image

MUMBAI: She was nine months old when a Mumbai couple first became her guardians through an order of the Bombay high court. Twenty-one years later, through another HC order, she can finally legally call them her adoptive parents.Last month, Justice G S Kulkarni held that the woman, under legal guardianship since 1998, has a basic human right to a legal identity and can be adopted, despite her current adult status, by her now 66-year-old ailing guardian, Mathew Abreo.Abreo and his wife had first petitioned HC in 1998 to take her home as her guardians under the Guardians and Wards Act. Last year, Abreo, who lost his wife a year earlier, petitioned HC againthis time to legally adopt her.“Mere guardianship being conferred...would certainly not suffice and it has lost its efficacy” as the girl is now a major, said Justice Kulkarni. He held she now definitely requires to be “conferred a legal status of being a daughter of the petitioner”.In 1999, in a landmark judgment, HC had laid down that “right to life” as provided under Article 21of the Indian Constitution of “orphaned, abandoned, destitute or similarly situated child includes the right to be adopted by willing parent/parents and to have a home, a name and a nationality”.The judgment had paved way for adoption among non-Hindu communities which under personal laws were at the time allowed only to be guardians—a tag that did not confer all legal rights of a parent-child relationship on them. There was a legal vacuum for non-Hindus to adopt.Adoption confers the same status and rights as a natural-born child. “The right to be adopted is an enforceable civil right,” the bench of Justice F I Rebello had held in his October 1999 judgment. Last month, Justice Kulkarni relied on Justice Rebello’s ruling and the principles and guidelines he laid down and permitted the foster father’s plea to enforce his right to adopt.The HC had earlier held in the absence of any law setting out who could adopt from among the Christian community, persons who took a child in guardianship under the Guardians and Wards Act also have a right to petition the courts to adopt the child.

JAIPUR: The police busted an interstate gang of four persons who were behind breaking into vacant houses as well as offices in states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh , Gujarat and few others. Since August to December last year, the gang had broken into at least four apartments in Jaipur and made off with lakhs of valuables.

DCP Jaipur West Kavendra Singh Sagar said, “A case was registered in August last year when a unidentified accused broke into a vacant house in Bani Park and took off with Rs 50,000 in cash and one pistol. Following this a team was constituted to look into all such similar robberies.”

Cops started looking at the CCTV footage in Bani Park and found few suspicious people roaming around in the area who appeared to be doing a recce. Based on information from a source, cops traced the accused who confessed to the Bani Park robbery and also admitted to several others during the last few months of 2019.

200,['3/01/2020'],Delhi: Forensic software to help ID suspects even from low-resolution videos,"This story is from January 3, 2020

Representative image

NEW DELHI: Realising the potential of CCTV footage and mobile videos in identification of suspects, Delhi Police is procuring an advanced video forensic technology that will help retrieve, enhance quality and analyse clips of crime spots and riots.

CCTV cameras have been of a great help to police. In the recent violence during the anti-CAA protests, every suspect was identified through CCTV footage or mobile videos.

Today, over half the crimes in the city are either being solved with the help of CCTVs or the footage turns into a crucial piece of evidence. Often, the images are blurred or of bad quality, which makes the probe hit a temporary dead end. Currently, police have been taking the help of private labs and individuals to enhance the quality of the images.

Police said the software would support recovery of digital videos from the original evidence or a forensics clone. It would have the capacity to bypass system-level passwords and provide the examiner direct access to the recorded data. The software would also help identify and handle drive-level encryption on supported file systems and also recover formatted, deleted and partially overwritten videos.

The software will also help police in filing chargesheets as case notes linked to forensic video evidence can be inserted in it.

“The technology will help us process digital or analog video evidence and enhance dark and poor quality security and surveillance videos. It will have the facility to print stills from video so that hard copies can be circulated for identification of suspects. The programme can also sharpen the clips and adjust the brightness and contrast in images,” said an officer.

A de-blurring facility, with features like focus de-blur and motion de-blur, will help police identify fast-moving vehicles in the clips. The programme will be equipped with a field kit with tools to capture audio and videos directly from a DVR without having direct access to the hard drive.

KOCHI: CBSE schools in the city are struggling to conduct revision classes and model exams for Class X and XII students with not enough working days due to the preponed board exams, which are scheduled to begin on February 15, instead of March first week, like previous years.

Moreover, the preponed practical board exams, which should be conducted between January 1 and February 7, add to the woes as it cuts off around 15 working days, which could otherwise have been used for revision classes.

As the school authorities have no other option but conduct the revision sessions and model exams back to back within a tight time schedule, teachers said that the students are finding it difficult and the pressure might affect their confidence.

The school authorities said that the vacation classes in April and May need to be allowed next academic year onwards as it will give enough time to complete the portions, revision classes and model exams smoothly.

""Most of the schools have somehow managed to complete the portions before the Christmas vacation began by taking extra hours in the morning and evening most of the days. Also, most schools have started working on Saturdays. But, the difficulty is in conducting revision classes and model exams, which are highly beneficial for the students, unhurriedly. The loss of around 15 days due to the preponement of the board exam by the CBSE is a challenge as it will make us reduce the gap between the model exams. Though many schools have started the model exams, students do not get enough time to prepare for each exam,"" said K A Francis, secretary of Confederation of Sahodaya Complexes and the principal of Naipunya Public School, Thrikkakara.

Unlike previous years, the CBSE has made it mandatory for the schools to have observers for conducting board practical exams. ""The availability and convenience of the observers, mostly principals or senior PG teachers from other schools, is another concern for schools to schedule the practical exam dates. For each class, it needs at least 3 days for completing each practical exam and the observer has to be present on each day. So making the timetable according to convenient dates is more challenging now,"" said Juby Paul, principal, ToC H Public School.

Earlier, the Kerala CBSE Schools Management Association (KCSMA), had requested CBSE to grant permission to start the new academic year in April just like Kendriya Vidyalaya . The memorandum further said that if holidays are given in April and May for students, all CBSE schools - which will be examination and evaluation centres for public exams by the end of that academic year- may find it difficult to schedule exams and conduct classes in February/March due to space constraints and lack of staff. But a decision on this is yet to be taken.

Sanjay Raut

MUMBAI: Days after Shiv Sena inducted Sillod MLA Abdul Sattar as junior minister, senior party leader and Saamna editor Sanjay Raut said on Thursday he will attend a Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH) function to oppose the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the city on Saturday.

The meet, being organised by JIH, Mumbai, and Association for Protection of Civil Rights (APCR) at Marathi Patrakar Sangh, will see Raut, Justice (retd) B G Kolse Patil, senior counsel Mihir Desai and APCR president and senior advocate Yusuf Muchchala debate the relationship between CAA and NRC “to understand their constitutional implications,” said a JIH representative. Though Sena had backed CAA in Lok Sabha, it abstained from Rajya Sabha during voting. Subsequently, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said the state would wait for Supreme Court verdict on CAA before deciding whether to oppose or support NRC.

Meanwhile, a group of community leaders has panned Congress for denying Mumbadevi MLA Amin Patel a ministerial post. “He is not just popular in his constituency (Mumbadevi), he is always available to help people. As a minister, he would have been a big asset for Congress,” said Sunni spiritual leader Maulana Moin Ashraf Quadri.

207,['3/01/2020'],Manoj Tiwari: Modi govt to give pucca houses in slums,"This story is from January 3, 2020

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari

NEW DELHI: Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari on Thursday said that the Modi government would provide pucca houses to the residents of slums across the capital.

Addressing a public meeting in east Delhi’s Mandawali area, Tiwari said that the registration of details under the scheme ‘Jahan Jhuggi, Wahan Makaan’ had already started on Delhi Development Authority’s portal.

“I come from a poor family and I know the pain of not having a pucca house. I have also spent 23 nights in Delhi’s slums and understand the sufferings of people. I can say this with confidence that the Modi government is working to alleviate this suffering,” Tiwari said.

To propagate the scheme, the Delhi BJP has also started putting up large hoardings of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in JJ clusters.

The move comes days after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal started distributing certificates to slum dwellers promising them pucca houses in place of their jhuggis. Delhi government has distributed about 65,000 such certificates.

The BJP hoardings ask people to register for the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna (Urban) for owning two room-set houses, which will have water, electricity and sewer connections. Party functionaries said that help centres would be opened in slums for assisting people in registrations. “We have targeted to put up large hoardings of the PMAY in 700 JJ clusters, where around 20 lakh people live,” Delhi BJP JJ cluster cell president Umesh Verma said.

Party sources said that about 1,000 hoardings have already been installed in different parts of the city, including Wazirpur, Tughalaqabad, Kalkaji, Jangpura and RK Puram. The BJP has also put up new hoardings in unauthorised colonies which promise ownership rights to the residents of these areas.

The Delhi Development Authority, meanwhile, approved a proposal to undertake in-situ redevelopment and rehabilitation of JJ clusters on a public-private partnership mode, officials said on Thursday. The decision was taken during a meeting of the urban body at Raj Niwas, PTI reported.

MUMBAI: Kurar police arrested a 60-year-old man who allegedly hurled a flute in the direction of magistrate SU Baghele at the city civil and sessions court in Dindoshi on Thursday. The flute hit the judge’s steno-typist who suffered a minor injury.

The incident occurred around 11am when the accused, Omkarnath Pandey, walked into the court room wearing an advocate’s gown and flung the object.

“Pandey is employed as a security guard and walked into the court premises wearing an advocate’s uniform and hurled the flute claiming it is Krishna Jayanti,” said a police officer. Kurar police senior inspector Balasaheb Salunkhe said Pandey has been arrested.

To avoid such incidents from recurring on the court premises in future, additional principal judge M S Sharma has made it mandatory for all advocates and their baggage to undergo a security check at the entrance of Dindoshi court with immediate effect.

217,['3/01/2020'],Mark Boucher hungry to pass on his knowledge to youngsters: Dean Elgar,"This story is from January 3, 2020

Mark Boucher. (Getty Images)

MUMBAI: Before it ended, 2019 provided a silver lining in the cloud of international cricket . South Africa, who were thrashed badly by India just a few months earlier, picked themselves up and against most expectations, outplayed England by 107 runs in the first Test at Centurion.

In a year which saw South Africa crash out at the league stage in the World Cup in the summer, this victory provides plenty of hope to their fans as the hosts take on England in the second Test, which begins at Cape Town from Friday. “It was an important win for us. We haven’t really had the greatest ‘Test year.’ There were a few tough games that we played in the build-up to this series, so that was a good ‘character build-up’ for the boys. Obviously, the hangover is still there. Hopefully, we can build on it,” South Africa’s opening batsman Dean Elgar told TOI in an exclusive interview from Cape Town.

It enabled the Proteas to log their first points on board in the World Test championship. “We are actually so far behind from the leaders at the moment, that we shouldn’t be worried about that. We should ultimately start focusing a little bit more on our team dynamics and what it means to still play for the side and hopefully, the wins will look after themselves. We would try to look after cricket, so that cricket can ultimately look after us!” he says with a chuckle.

Surely, some credit for this turnaround in a such a short time, must go to the new, star-studded support staff in the Proteas set-up — Graeme Smith is now the director of cricket, Mark Boucher is the coach and Jacques Kallis is the batting consultant. “They’ve obviously arrived in the group with a lot of credibility and respect. I’m going to remember it forever that I sat with these cricket legends. They come in the change room and provide the environment with a lot of confidence,” he says, before explaining how he had already benefited from Boucher’s coaching skills at the Titans.

“I have been fortunate with Boucher, as he taught us at the Titans for threefour years. I know what he is about. He is one of the best cricketers to have ever played the game. He also brings a lot to the table with his experience. He has played international cricket for 13-15 years and with that comes a lot of knowledge, and it seems as if he is really hungry to pass on that knowledge down to the younger players. He wants everyone to do well, which is awesome for us as young cricketers. It’s awesome to have these guys around. They provide a bit more clarity and make the environment a little bit more peaceful,” he explains.

A huge setback for the Proteas has been their top players migrating to England after being lured by Kolpak contracts. “I’m a realist when it comes to these topics (financial well-being). I have grown up with the Kolpak players, and have played against them in county cricket. England are in a stronger position with Kolpak players there. I am not going to deny the fact that there are some serious cricketers there and that’s the reason why other countries would want to come and breach our system,” he says.

With the ICC deciding to make four-day Tests mandatory from 2023, there is a huge debate around whether time’s up for five-day Tests. Elgar, himself South Africa’s ‘Test specialist,’ bats for the traditional format to continue. “When it comes to Test cricket, I’m a purist. We don’t play a lot of Tests that go into the fifth day anymore. I would like to think that cricketers out there still want to play the five-day version, because I would like to see a five-day Test. It’s an assimilation of what cricket is,” he opines.

KOCHI: The action council of residents living nearby Alfa Serene apartment in Maradu who began an indefinite hunger strike demanding protection of their homes, ended the strike on Thursday night. The council ended the strike after local self-government minister A C Moideen promised that the technical committee will take a decision on their demands at a meeting on Friday.

The council members made it clear that they want the demolition schedule to be changed at a meeting with the minister.

As of now, Alfa Serene and Holy Faith H2O are to be demolished on January 11 and Jain Coral Cove and Golden Kayaloram on January 12. While Alfa Serene and Holy Faith H2O are in thickly populated localities, the other two are in a relatively sparsely populated area.

""The minister promised us that our concerns would be addressed. He also said the insurance company will give the money to reconstruct the houses, if they are damaged beyond repair. It will be based on the market value,"" said T H Nadeera, Maradu municipality chairperson.

Residents living near Alfa Serene alleged a conspiracy in the authorities' decision to go ahead with the plan to raze the two structures, situated in thickly populated area, in the first phase.

""If the nine houses close to Alfa Serene suffer damages, it will be a huge disaster. It will dissuade the Supreme Court stop the demolition. The court will be forced to impose only a fine on the builders instead of ordering complete demolition. If they demolish Jain Coral Cove and Golden Kayaloram on the first day, it will help them to rectify mistakes, if any,"" said Rajeevan Nair, who lives behind Alfa Serene's second tower.

Rajeevan and his neighbour have booked a rented house fearing their houses will be completely damaged during the demolition. Some other residents have shifted to other places after cracks developed on the walls of their houses and due to dust pollution.

NEW DELHI: North Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to organise Atal Vyapar Mela, a traders’ fair, from December 25 to January 3 every year at Ramlila Maidan to help small and mediumsize businesses.

“The fair, named after the late Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, will have 7x5 feet and 10x10 feet stalls and these will be allotted to small and medium traders dealing in garments, handloom and food industries at minimum charges. Those who can’t afford to put up stalls at the India International Trade Fair can participate in this event,” said Tilak Raj Kataria, leader of the House. This will be the first such initiative by a corporation, he added.

In its finalised budget estimates for 2020-21, the civic agency has decided to dispose of the vehicles left in its parking lots for years. “Thousands of vehicles are kept illegally and despite obtaining no-objection certificates from the traffic police, we could not take action against them for years,” said Kataria. But in the 2020-21 budget, the corporation has created a separate head for these abandoned vehicles and hopes to earn Rs 15 lakh after selling them, he added.

However, the corporation will not hike the property tax or introduce any tax. The property tax will be collected from the residential properties in unauthorised colonies only after their regularisation.

The budget also informed that eight trommel machines had already been installed at the Bhalswa landfill for biomining of legacy waste and three more would be installed soon. “We aim to install more such machines in future from the Centre’s urban development funds to complete the biomining process in a year’s time and develop Rastriya Smarak Mandir there,” he said.

The cleared area will have replicas representing the heritage monuments of undivided India such as the Katas Raj temple in Pakistan, the Dhakeshwari National temple in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and Chanakya Ashram in Pakistan’s Taxila. “It will give an opportunity to those born after 1947 to understand the relevance of our culture,” said Kataria.

J SANDHIYA RANI

Two young women have triumphed in the rural local body elections. Winning with a margin of 210 votes in the Kattinaikanthotty village panchayat in Krishnagiri district, 21-year-old J Sandhiya Rani has become the youngest woman village panchayat president in the state. In Tiruvarur district, R Subitha, a 22-year-old BBA graduate was elected president of Poosalangudi panchayat in Thiruthuraipoondi union.

Sandhiya, who contested as an independent, is a third year BBA student in a private college at Malur in Karnataka.

Talking to TOI, Sandhiya said she was grateful to the voters of four villages who elected her without having reservations about her age.

“The villagers have reposed their confidence in me and I will try my best to fulfil their demands,” she said.

Sandhiya’s father Jayasarathi is a farmer and former president of the Kattinaikanthotty panchayat. He decided to field his daughter after the panchayat was reserved for women.

“Our panchayat’s primary issue is drinking water. I will give much attention to that,” she said, adding that she would bring all the basic amenities to her panchayat with her father’s guidance.

Subitha, who was elected the Poosalangudi panchayat president securing 499 votes, had headed several students’ federations during her studies. She was also a member of the All India Students’ Federation (AISF) affiliated to the CPI(M).

“I have headed various federations during my college days. I think it would help me to lead my team. I am aspiring to bring as much development as possible to my village during my tenure,” she said.

NEW DELHI: Tata Sons told the Supreme Court on Thursday that the NCLAT erred in recording that the Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) Group, of which Cyrus Investment and Sterling Investment are a part, had invested Rs 1,00,000 crore in Tata Sons when they had actually put in a mere Rs 69 crore.“Admittedly, Cyrus Investment and Sterling Investment have acquired majority of their shareholdings throughbonus issue and rights issues. While Cyrus and Sterling invested merely Rs 69 crore, they have received dividend of around Rs 872 crore from Tata Sons from 1991 to 2016,” the Tata Sons said in its petition challenging NCLAT’s decision to reinstate Cyrus Mistry as executive chairman of Tata Sons. Mistry was removed on October 24, 2016.It said SP Group first became shareholders of Tata Sons in 1965 by acquiring 40 ordinary shares and 48 preference shares of its paid-up share capital. “Thereafter over the years, Cyrus Investment and Sterling Investment acquired Tata Sons’ shares (largely through bonus and rights issue of shares), which have allowed them to reap great economic reward,” the petition said.The Tata petition said, “This is evident from the fact that their original investment of Rs 69 crore (a large chunk of which was made at the time of the rights issue in 1995), appreciated to around Rs 58,441 crore in March 2016.”Explaining the shareholding pattern of SP Group, including Pallonji Shapoorji Mistry and his son Cyrus Mistry, it said they hold 18.4% of the paid-up ordinary share capital in Tata Sons, which represents 2.91% of the issued share capital of Tata Sons (including ordinary and preference share capital). In August 2006, Cyrus Mistry was appointed as nonexecutive director independently and not as a nominee of SP Group.Ratan Tata’s decision to step down as executive director of Tata Sons in 2012 after a 21-year stint saw Cyrus Mistry’s appointment as executive deputy chairman for five years from April 1, 2012 till March 31, 2017. On December 29, 2012, Mistry was designated as executive chairman. He was also appointed as director and non-executive chairman on boards of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Tata Industries, Tata Teleservices, Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Tata Power, Tata Global Beverages, Indian Hotels Company and Tata Chemicals.Tata Sons in its petition said, “Instead of living up to the expectations of the Selection Committee and taking the Tata Group to newer heights, the performance of Tata Sons and most of the other operating companies was unsatisfactory during chairmanship of Mistry. Mistry’s leadership was also marred by his reluctance to disassociate himself from his family business.”The last straw on the camel’s back was Mistry’s decision for Tata Power to acquire renewable energy assets of Welspun Renewables Energy at about Rs 9,000 crore by keeping the Tata Sons board in the dark about the transaction, the petitioner alleged. “By October 24, 2016, Tata Sons had completely lost their confidence in the ability of Mistry to lead the Tata Group” and agreed for a motion to replace Mistry.The petition said, after N Chandrasekaran took over as executive chairman of Tata Sons on February 21, 2017, “Tata Sons is on an accelerated path of growth and witnessing improvement in several financial parameters”.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73078967,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-114091,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/after-cyrus-mistrys-exit-growing-under-n-chandrasekaran-tata-sons/articleshow/73078916.cms

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A local CPM leader at Parassala was arrested by police on Thursday on charges of attempt to murder for allegedly subjecting a man to brutal assault for questioning extortion.

Pradeep, 29, of Naduthottam under Parassala police station limits is the secretary of CPM's Naduthottam branch. The complainant, Senthil Roy alias Reji, 39, of Valanvila near Injivila under Parassala police station limits is being treated at Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College Hospital. Roy, a jackfruit vendor, has sustained five broken ribs, a fracture on skull and injuries on lungs, police said.

Parassala police station house officer inspector S M Riyaz said as per the statement of the complainant, he was assaulted by a group of men, including Pradeep, during the early hours of January 1 at Valanvila after he refused to give them money for buying beverages for New Year celebrations. They kicked him down and ran an autorickshaw over his body, inflicting serious injuries on his ribcage.

""The complainant mentioned four people whom he could identify and three men, whom he could not identify. Pradeep was one among those identified. Hence, we took him into custody and recorded his arrest. A search is on for the remaining assailants,'' the inspector said.

Though the alleged attack took place around 1am on Wednesday, police received the information only by the evening. On the same night, they visited the complainant at the hospital and recorded his statement following which a case was registered. On Thursday, around 11am, they detained Pradeep and simultaneously made arrangements to record the sworn statement of the complainant by a local magistrate under provisions of section 164 of CrPC owing to the serious nature of the case as the accused was a local leader of the ruling party. They also moved Pradeep to a secret location anticipating protests from his party workers.

Meanwhile, the CPM local leadership of Parassala cried foul over the arrest of Pradeep. Speaking to TOI, CPM Parassala local committee secretary R Biju said Pradeep was not even there at the crime scene when it occurred. ""Pradeep has been on the forefront of activities related to curbing substance mafia in the locality. The people who attacked Roy are members of substance mafia. There are people, including elderly persons returning from church, who witnessed the attack. According to them, it was just two men who assaulted Roy, and Pradeep was not there,'' Biju said.

NAVI MUMBAI: After a video of a group of 11 youths being harassed by another group and accused of consuming alcohol and drugs during New Year celebrations in the Peb fort area of Karjat went viral, the police initiated action on Thursday.

The police are yet to ascertain how many people assaulted the youths and made them remove their shirts on New Year’s Eve.

The victims included a Chhattisgarh resident, while the rest were from Mumbai.

The victims were stripped, assaulted, made to kneel down and forced to promise not to repeat what they were doing.

The group that did the moral policing filmed the incident and posted the video on social media.

“After the video went viral on social media, our officials had a discussion on the issue with Raigad SP Anil Paraskar,” assistant inspector Avinash Patil said. “Based on his instructions, the details were found out and a suo motu police case has been registered for wrongful restraint (IPC 341) against unknown persons on Thursday.”

Patil said that after recording the statement of the victims additional sections would be invoked and a manhunt launched for the suspects.

“As nobody goes to the fort at the year-end, our teams were not patrolling the area,” he said. “One of the victims was supposed to come to the police station but was not able to do it due to some family issues.”

Locals say there are many organisations, many of them with very similar names, that are into moral policing there. The number of people involved in the harassment would be known after the victims come forward and give details of the incident. One of the accused is partly visible in the video but is yet to be identified.

The tower will be inaugurated by Gautam Gambhir on Friday.

NEW DELHI: In a first-of-its-kind initiative, the Traders’ Association Lajpat Nagar (TALN), in coordination with east Delhi area MP Gautam Gambhir , has decided to install a 20-foot-tall prototype air purifier in Central Market.

The tower will be inaugurated by Gambhir on Friday.

Ashwani Marwah, general secretary of the association, said that the tower will purify air within a circumference area of 500-750 metres.

“We were working on this for long. It could be realised only after we got permission from various authorities, including South Corporation, to install the tower over a covered drain. Our area MP’s foundation agreed to support the cost of equipment. We will bear the running cost,” he said.

“It may also curb foul smell emanating from the main drain in Lajpat Nagar,” he added.

Gambhir said that the tower is expected to treat up to 6,00,000 cubic metres of air per day and collect more than 75% of two kinds of pollutants i.e. PM 2.5 and PM 10.

“Fighting Delhi’s pollution is my priority and we are working on several such initiatives. We will analyse this outdoor purifier’s performance and then install several such purifiers across the constituency,” the MP added.

(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: With a large number of banks only issuing Mastercard or Visa cards, the finance ministry has decided to ask them to ensure that there is no infrastructure or card constraint that holds back consumers from taking advantage of the benefit of no merchant discount rate on RuPay or UPI.

Similarly, the revenue department is meeting industry bodies to spread the message that all businesses with annual turnover of Rs 50 crore or more put in place the required infrastructure for the smooth rollout of the regime that was announced in the Budget. “Anyone who does not allow consumers to take advantage of this scheme will face a daily penalty of Rs 5,000. We want to ensure that the rollout is smooth,” a senior officer told TOI.

The sources said that tax officials will visit stores from February 1 to check if the facility is available or not and anyone found to be violating the diktat will be fined.

The move is part of the government’s push to promote digital transactions, which not only help track fund flow easily but also reduce the cost of business. Tax officials said that banks should be encouraging the use of cashless transactions instead of hobbling them. The revenue department stepped in to announce the measures that banks were seen to be moving slowly in the absence of RBI guidelines.

“Banks can’t be seen to be promoting one or the other payment system, they need to provide RuPay and UPI,” said an officer.

NAVI MUMBAI: The Koparkhairane police are on the lookout for an employee of a security firm, which handles cash for several bank ATMs, for allegedly decamping with Rs 3.96 crore cash meant for 35 ATMs in Thane, Bhiwandi and Palghar.

Senior inspector Suryakant Jagdale said accused Sachin Wagh (35) is a resident of Kalwa, Thane and had been working for Securitrans India Pvt Ltd (SIPL) for the past 12 years as senior custodian of the cash to be deposited in ATMs. “He had the keys and passwords of 37 ATMs in Thane, Bhiwandi and Palghar areas and he allegedly misused this information to commit the crime,” the police officer said.

Jagdale said the embezzlement came to light after Wagh did not report to work on December 26. When Wagh was not reachable on his cellphone, staff members went to his house. They were told he had left for office at 6 am.

“An audit of route number 2 assigned to Wagh revealed he had loaded only partial cash in 35 ATMs and swindled the rest between December 11 and December 13,” Jagdale said.As the agency has alleged some bank staff might also be involved in the crime, an FIR has been registered against Wagh and others.

Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar reviewed the Ambedkar memorial project on Thursday

MUMBAI: In a bid to connect with NCP’s Dalit voters, deputy CM Ajit Pawar visited Koregaon-Bhima on January 1 and on Thursday paid tributes to Dr BR Ambedkar at Chaityabhoomi and reviewed the Ambedkar memorial project at the Indu Mill compound in Dadar.

Ajit on Wednesday skipped a meeting on GST called by CM Uddhav Thackeray and went to Koregaon Bhima in Pune district, where the ‘Jay Stambh’ marks the battle of 1818 remembered by Dalits where soldiers from the Mahar community fighting as part of the British forces were ranged against the army of the Peshwas. On Thursday, he first went to Chaityabhoomi and then visited the Indu Mill compound. After a review meeting with officials of the implementing authority, MMRDA, the deputy CM told mediapersons, “The project will be completed by April 14, 2022. There are a few formalities to be completed regarding permission. However, work will get started this month.”

He instructed officials that gates of the monument should be high and a tree plantation programme undertaken to ensure more greenery. “After reviewing the project, gave instructions to concerned project officials regarding future work. Discussed key issues including security aspect at the time,” Pawar tweeted.

PM Modi had laid the foundation stone of the memorial in October 2015. During the BJP-Sena government, then CM Devendra Fadnavis had said the project would be completed by December 6, 2020 (Mahaparinivan Din, Ambedkar’s death anniversary), while the Maha Vikas Aghadi has extended the deadline by two years, until April 14, 2022 (Ambedkar’s birth anniversary).

NCP chief Sharad Pawar had, after the assembly poll results, told party leaders to work to win the confidence of the Dalit community. NCP, which won 54 seats, has been concerned about Dalit voters going to the Prakash Ambedkar-led VBA which bagged a sizeable chunk of votes during the LS and assembly polls.

241,['3/01/2020'],Karnataka’s Jammu and Kashmir luxury hotel plan hits snag,"This story is from January 3, 2020

Karnataka tourism minister CT Ravi

BENGALURU: Three months after it was mooted, the Karnataka government’s ambitious proposal to run a luxury hotel in Jammu & Kashmir has failed to take off due to technical reasons that include the absence of internet and mobile services in J&K and the change in the status of J&K from a state to Union Territory.

The state government had proposed a luxury hotel in J&K soon after the Centre revoked special status to the state in September last year. Tourism minister CT Ravi had written to then J&K governor Satyapal Malik and outlined the state government’s intent.

Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation (KSTDC) was to run the hotel. Speaking to TOI, KSTDC MD Kumar Pushkar said the government plans to buy 10 to 15 acres of land in J&K.

“We want to facilitate Karnataka tourists who frequent J&K for religious events like the Amarnath Yatra,” Pushkar said. “More than commercial viability, we are looking at a property to serve citizens. However, we are yet to hear from the J&K administration.”

Officials said the communication blockade had hampered efforts. “We were unable to reach officials to know the status of our proposal. This included the governor’s office,” said a senior official.

However, Pushkar said he managed to get in touch with the director of tourism for J&K a few days ago and there has been some development on the proposal. “If required, a team from Karnataka will visit J&K for further negotiation,” Pushkar said.

The other major problem was the change in the status of J&K. “The minister’s first letter was addressed to the state government of J&K. Now, they are changing it to a UT and they have asked for a fresh process.”

“The J&K governor had in fact given me an appointment in this regard on December 20, but due to anti-CAA protests, the meet was cancelled,” Ravi said.

Union health minister Harsh Vardhan and Delhi Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia. (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday lashed out at Union health minister Harsh Vardhan , a day after the latter wrote to LG Anil Baijal against the scheduled parent-teacher meeting in government schools on January 4 in “extreme cold weather”.

Addressing a press conference, Sisodia said, “How dare the health minister write a letter to stall the meeting, he should be ashamed...” The deputy CM said AAP government believed that PTMs were instrumental in improving the quality of education in Delhi and accused the central minister of conspiring for political mileage.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the PTMs allowed parents to discuss with teachers the progress of their wards and that many parents eagerly waited for these meets. The CM said that not only would the PTMs be organised as scheduled but he would also attend one of them.

Sisodia, too, insisted, “PTMs are one of the major reasons behind the remarkable transformation of Delhi’s government schools. It is clear that BJP is against the very idea of affordable and quality education.” He added: “It is unfortunate that we have such leaders and ministers who can stoop to the level of stopping a PTM. BJP is not interested in developing the education system of the country or any state, but in Delhi, because AAP government has done remarkable work, it wants to disrupt it.”

Sisodia said AAP had worked hard in the last five years to develop the government school education system in Delhi and now the Delhi model was being discussed everywhere. He said the PTM was scheduled keeping in the mind the upcoming board examinations.

Harsh Vardhan rejected the allegations and said he didn’t need a certificate from Sisodia. “They (AAP) are disturbed because they are going to face a very tough situation in the election. They may come up with more such remarks. I believe in my duty. The education fraternity is well aware of my credentials (sic),” he said.

He added that he wrote the letter only after a teachers’ association reached out to him.

244,['3/01/2020'],"IOC plans to monetise its assets through SPVs, arms","This story is from January 3, 2020

(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: India’s largest oil refiner and fuel retailer, IOC , is looking at monetising its pipelines and storage infrastructure.

The plan is to create special purpose vehicles (SPVs) or subsidiaries to tap private equity and venture capital funds to maximise utilisation of assets, and lock in future revenue.

The option of BOOT (build, own, operate and transfer) is also on the table as the company has successfully implemented this model for the tank farm, the vital storage facility, at its 300,000bpd (barrels-per-day) Paradip refinery in Odisha.

Sources told TOI the discussions among the top management and the parent oil ministry revolve around creating SPVs or subsidiaries and then offering stake in them to PE or VC funds. The discussions are at a nascent stage and the quantum of stake to be offered will depend on the assets and their layouts.

“Given the low interest rates abroad, many PE and VC funds are willing to invest in IOC assets as they offer assured and elevated returns due to high utilisation as well as a quick exit option, while the asset can remain with IOC — something like a hospitality arrangement,” one executive told TOI.

The PE route, thus, is seen as economical funding source for IOC without losing assets. PE funding will lock in future revenue at today’s value. It will provide money for the expansion, reduce borrowings and interest outgo. This will raise profitability and dividend payout.

On New Year Day, IOC chairman Sanjiv Singh told employees not to “consume WhatsApp theories” and focus on the company’s inherent strengths to prepare for the changing energy market architecture.

Los Angeles, Jan 3 (AFP) Chile's Joaquin Niemann, riding the confidence-boost of a Presidents Cup appearance, fired seven birdies in a seven-under par 66 on Thursday to take a one-shot first-round lead in the US PGA Tour Tournament of Champions. Niemann didn't win a match in the International team's Presidents Cup loss to the United States at Royal Melbourne last month, but the 21-year-old said the week was a valuable learning experience. ""I think the Presidents Cup was huge for me, for my career, for my future,"" Niemann said. ""I think during that week I learned a lot, I was with the best players in the world, I was teammates with Adam Scott. I talked a lot with them. It was an unbelievable week."" Niemann, whose six-shot win at The Greenbrier in September secured his spot in the winner's only Tournament of Champions, showed plenty of confidence on the par-73 Plantation course at Kapalua, Hawaii. He rolled in a 31-foot birdie putt for his first birdie of the day at the fourth, and his remaining six birdies were all from within 11 feet. He missed just one green in regulation, and got up and down for par to head into the second round with a one-shot lead over world number four Justin Thomas. Thomas also played without a bogey, grabbing five of his six birdies on the back nine to take sole possession of second place on 67. Americans Matt Kuchar and Rickie Fowler shared third on 68, with defending champion Xander Schauffele heading a group of five players on 69. Only nine players in the 34-man field were over par in Thursday's light breezes -- which were expected to be replaced by gusty winds on Friday. Despite the relatively benign conditions, it was an eventful day for two-time tournament winner Dustin Johnson. The former world number one's one-under par 72 included five birdies and an eagle along with a double-bogey seven at the par-five ninth and four bogeys.

246,['3/01/2020'],"West Bengal government leans on schools for buses to ease jams, reduce pollution","The stretch in front of a school on AJC Bose Road choked with vehicles during closure time

KOLKATA: Schools in the city had been asked to introduce buses to ferry students to and from homes to decongest roads and reduce pollution, state chief secretary Rajiva Sinha stated in an affidavit to the NGT in relation to a case on the city’s degrading air quality filed by green crusader Subhas Datta.Twenty-seven institutions, including La Martiniere that does not have school buses, submitted a report to the government about their willingness to start the facility and that they expected a substantial number of students to avail of the service from April 2020. Sinha mentioned the schools’ report in his affidavit. At schools that don’t have buses, especially those located in central Kolkata, kids travel by private or pooled cars, contributing to snarls owing to the sheer number of vehicles used by them. Because of the schools’ locations on thoroughfares or just off them, traffic came to a grinding halt at the beginning and end of school hours every day, said a Nabanna source, adding that the congestion led to enormous pollution.A bus occupied a space of three cars (three-passenger car unit) on the road but carried passengers of nine cars, said an expert, adding a bus thus saved fuel and emission of at least nine cars. Pointing out that most private cars ferried only one student to a school, Bhargav Moitra of IIT Kharagpur, who came up with an integrated model for school transit system, said school buses were the most preferred option to decongest roads. Moreover, if schools invested in electric buses, it would be a profitable venture in the long run, as it would mean low energy cost and zero emission, Moitra said.A stakeholders’ committee, headed by commissioner of school education Soumitra Mohan, has held multiple meetings with big institutions in the city, especially those in central Kolkata. The committee forwarded their recommendation to the chief secretary. In the meeting, prime institutes, like Modern High, La Martiniere, Sri Sri Academy, Calcutta international School and Techno India took part. A La Martiniere official said they would convene a meeting with parents and senior police officers. “We will tell parents about our plan to introduce school buses. Even if 30%-40% students opt for the service, we will go for it. We know school buses will decongest roads to a great extent,” said the official.Modern High has recently increased its school bus fleet by one. “We will add more if more kids opt for school buses,” said an official. Father Don Bosco School principal Bikash Mondal, however, said, “Buses may not solve our problem. The adjacent Darga Road is not wide enough but school buses will add to the congestion. We have submitted our opinion, counter-signed by the local traffic police guard officer.”“Buses have distinct advantages as far as easing snarls and students’ safety are concerned. We now prefer 50-seater omnibus, which brings down the cost per student and ensures high level of comfort. Thanks to advancement of technology, like CCTV surveillance and RFID tags, security of children in modern bus system is also ensured,” said Anurag Agarwal, who runs 850 school buses for 16 big institutions in and around the city. IIT’s Moitra pointed out car-pooling had spoilt the system as parents were now got comfortable with doorto-door services. But for greater safety of students and city’s pollution, school buses were an absolutely necessity, he said. He added school buses saved hundreds of lives, provided millions of jobs nationwide, improved traffic and cut down on pollution.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73079173,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-766994,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/west-bengal-government-leans-on-schools-for-buses-to-ease-jams-reduce-pollution/articleshow/73079131.cms

248,['3/01/2020'],Why January is dubbed ‘divorce month’ in the US,"This story is from January 3, 2020

Representative image

Matrimonial attorneys across the United States have prepared for this January when divorce filings peak. Unofficially dubbed “divorce month” in legal circles in US, there’s a variety of reasons why couples have historically chosen to separate after the holidays — and a number of ways for clients to cope.

The phrase “divorce month” became so prevalent in matrimonial law that, in 2016, a study from the University of Washington was conducted to see if there was any statistical evidence to back up the anecdotes. Researchers examined divorce filings from 2001 to 2015 in the state of Washington and determined that filings did indeed increase in January, compared to December .

Ohio, Minnesota, Florida, and Arizona were found to exhibit similar patterns; according to Google Trends , the topic of “divorce” peaked the week of January 6 through 12. But while divorce filings spike in January, couples begin their search for legal resources during the holidays when many attorneys are out of office.

For many, the new year often reminds us that we need a fresh start. This is particularly common in unhealthy relationships and dead-end marriages, where couples may decide the best resolution is to part ways. It’s also important to remember that winter and summer holidays are culturally important times for families with children, and filing for divorce during them may be seen as inappropriate.

Other troubled marriages may see the holidays as a time to patch things up, with hopes that things will improve. People often raise their expectations during the holidays, despite past troubles in their relationship. Coupled with an expectation for positive change at the new year, many couples attempt to stick it out through the holidays.

But for others, the University of Washington study found the holidays to be exhausting and emotionally demanding, exposing cracks in their marriages.

Overall, experts advise to do what’s right for you. And, once you make your call, don’t look back.

NEW DELHI: Delhi home minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday laid the foundation stone for expansion of Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) in Rohini . The lab will be equipped with high-tech DNA lab for crime against women and children, advanced cyber forensic lab , facilities for testing of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, among other facilities.

Delhi government’s forensic science laboratory plays an important role in the area of scientific examination of crime exhibits and evidential clues which go a long way in fighting crime. Jain laid the foundation stone of Annexe Building on the premises of the FSL.

“The expansion of forensic facility would create fear among the criminals, and it would certainly bring down the crime rate in Delhi,” said Jain.

The expansion will equip the forensic lab with advanced narco analysis and brain mapping facilities for psychological examination of criminals. It will also get 24X7 advanced crime scene examination and investigation services. In the wake of the growing cyber crime cases of late, an advanced cyber forensic lab has also been planned. “All the facilities would be ultra modern to produce best results.”

Meanwhile, a separate vehicle examination site, which would be exclusively for examination of vehicles involved in crimes, is ready. It is expected to become operational soon.

The minister also inaugurated the brain fingerprinting facilities for forensic psychological examination for suspects and criminals. “The government has decided to search and establish the world-class latest technology and to reform the laboratory with wellequipped forensic tools and machinery,” the FSL said in a statement.

The move is in line with the target set by the state government to fill the vacant posts in different departments by the end of this year under the flagship ‘Ghar Ghar Rozgar’ scheme.

For filling up of vacant posts, the finance department has accorded approval to the proposal, which will now be put before the state cabinet. After getting the cabinet’s nod, the department aims to complete the recruitment process by the March 31.

In addition to new recruitment, the department has completed the process for promotions of primary teachers to master cadre, master cadre to lecturer, and lecturer to principal.

The department recently held a meeting with all the district education officers and they were directed to complete the seniority lists of the teachers and process of pending promotions at earliest.

Punjab education minister Vijay Inder Singla has said that recruitment of teachers and other staff is top priority and the recruitment process has been put on fast track mode.

The move has given a ray of hope to teacher eligibility test (TET)-qualified unemployed youth who have been staging protests for jobs. The minister has thus exhorted the unemployed youth to shed the path of demonstrations as the department has expedited the recruitment process.

The government jobs remain the first choice of educated youth of the state. There are about 1.10 lakh jobs in different departments of the state government which are lying vacant from past many years. Preference of government jobs over private jobs has been one of the key reasons for large number of private jobs offered during the job fairs not being taken up.

With figure of about 18,000, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited has the highest number of vacant post, followed by director of public instructions (secondary education) where about 5,000 posts are lying vacant. Around 12,000 posts at different levels are unfilled in local government department.

BATHINDA: Angered by getting his breakfast late and a trifle cold, an ex-serviceman shot dead his daughter-in-law in Kotkapura town of Faridkot. Sham Puri , 62, is a retired airman.

Neelam Rani, a school teacher, had to take care of her physically-impaired husband Manish and her father-in-law apart from her two children. Thursday being a holiday, she took her time preparing breakfast. So, when her father-in-law demanded his meal, she could not immediately comply, and by the time she did serve it, it had turned cold.

This led to a heated exchange between the two and Puri allegedly fired at Neelam with his .12 bore gun.

Police have arrested him and registered a case of murder and under the Arms Act.""

Pronnoy Roy (File photo)

MUMBAI: NDTV promoters Prannoy Roy and his wife Radhika approached the Bombay high court on Thursday to challenge a show-cause notice issued to them in 2018 by Sebi for alleged violations of insider trading rules. The markets regulator’s charges relate to the two trading in scrips of news channel NDTV as its promoters.

The Roys have challenged the validity of the notice dated August 31, 2018, issued by the regulator 10 years after the alleged trading activity in violation of Sebi (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations. Through their counsel Fereshte Sethna, the Roys submitted that the Sebi notice “constitutes a gross abuse of process” and that the allegations levelled by the regulator “are baseless and unfounded”. Their case is that there is “no shred of evidence” with Sebi, nor have they been furnished any documents to substantiate the allegations.

Their plea before the HC bench, headed by Justice S C Dharmadhikari, was to quash the notice and to be given documents which Sebi is relying on. Their case is that the nature of allegations levelled against the Roys are serious in nature, and hence require “clinching evidentiary basis” as a “mandatory precursor for the initiation of any such proceedings”.

Also, Sethna’s argument was that the framework doesn’t require records to be maintained for over three years by the company, and hence the notice for a 10-year-old trade puts them in an unfair position for rebutting. Their petition says that since the Sebi notice is issued after 10 years from the alleged transactions, relevant records are no longer available with them and hence the notice would “irretrievably prejudice and jeopardise the right to defend themselves”.

The Roys said that the Sebi notice relates to the proposed restructuring of NDTV into ‘news-related businesses’ and investments in ‘beyond news’ businesses held through NDTV Network Plc, in 2008, a proposal that was eventually not implemented.

256,['3/01/2020'],Tamil Nadu: Cattle farmers worried about new breeding Act,"This story is from January 3, 2020

Farmers from Madurai say imposing restrictions through Bovine Breeding Act 2019 by the government will have ad... Read More

MADURAI: At a time when farmers raising indigenous bulls are facing several financial hardships, the Tamil Nadu Bovine Breeding Act , 2019, will only make it harder for the farmers to raise non-castrated indigenous bulls . Harsh punishment like ₹50,000 fine for owning unlicensed bulls and forcing farmers to kill those which are declared to be unfit for reproduction, will force them out of the activity.

Experts say that the Act is aimed at facilitating corporates to flourish in the business of artificial insemination and make farmers dependent on large firms for insemination, just like the seed business which has gone into the hands of corporates.

B Mani, a bull owner from Mudakathan, said the new act says that officials can enter any premises without any notice for inspection if they believe there is bull raised with or without registration. It is no business of the state to check what kind of indigenous bulls are being raised by farmers. “If the government do not want to gove farmers incentives, it should at least stay away from imposing unnecessary burden. It will not be feasible for us to register and renew it every two years. There is a fine of ₹50,000 for not registering a bull. Why should a farmer have to undergo punishment for raising a bull,” he asked.

An official from animal husbandry said that the Act was brought since there has been no regulation in place for bovine breeding. It is also to prescribe standards for frozen semen production and artificial insemination. He also said that indiscriminate cross breeding will bring down the quality of bovine in the state.

The bloodline of exotic animal should not exceed 50% while doing crossbreeding and the act will regulate it, he said.

T Rajesh of Jallikattu Pathugappu Kuzhu said that they are not concerned about other sections of the law, which controls companies into production of frozen semen or artificial insemination services,butthey opposeonly section 12 of the act pertains to farmers.

262,['3/01/2020'],Mohali: Rs 2 lakh compensation for death caused by animal,"This story is from January 3, 2020

The move aims at controlling stray animal menace in Mohali

MOHALI: The municipal corporation has proposed a Rs 2-lakh compensation for death caused by an animal. In case the animal is a pet, its owner is liable to pay the compensation. And in case of a stray, the civic body will shell it out.

This is part of animal bylaws' draft for registration and control of stray animals. The agenda points will come up for approval in the MC house meeting slated for Friday. In case the victim becomes disabled due to the animal attack or bite, (s)he, too, will be entitled to Rs 2-lakh compensation, but only after the case is duly certified by the civil surgeon.

Besides, one family can get only three pets registered at a given time, and the registration will be renewed every year by April 1. Annual registration fee for a single pet is proposed at Rs 100, and late fee for first month will be Rs 100 (over and above the registration fee), for two months Rs 200 and beyond two months five times the first month late fee.

Earlier, the MC had no bylaws to govern the stray animals and compensate the victims. A few months ago, it had announced to compensate the stray dog bite victims with Rs 1,500, but no one came forward to claim it. The byelaws draft says the compensation should be settled by the joint commissioner or executive officer of the corporation concerned on application under Rule 12 of the Act. Owners will have to get their animals registered with the MC and put a tag around their necks. The animal to be registered will undergo a medical examination and the owner will have to produce the medical fitness certificate along with the registration application.

Mohali mayor Kulwant Singh said, ""To control the stray animal menace, dog or cattle or even monkeys, we have drafted policies for registration of animals as well as compensation to victims. Some changes in the construction of cattle pound and its maintenance have also been proposed.""

The byelaws say animals' owners or caretakers will not allow them to be at large at a public place without a muzzle and a leash. The byelaws will also defend the Prevention of Cruelty to the Animals Act, 1960, and the violating owner will be tried as per law and a complaint can be made to the MC.

CHENNAI: Defending champions Chennai City FC ( CCFC ) are all set to release their top striker Pedro Manzi in the January transfer window. It was learnt that the Spanish forward is likely to join a Japanese second division club. An official announcement will be made in the next couple of days.

A source confirmed the development even though he didn’t reveal the name of the Japanese club. “CCFC have come to an understanding with the Japanese club after they were offered a very good deal. Manzi is also okay with the move as it will present him with a fresh challenge. The decision was taken after consulting with CCFC coach Akbar Nawas,” the source told TOI on Thursday.

Manzi played a crucial role in Chennai City’s title triumph last season as he led the attack with flair. He was the joint top scorer with 21 goals and was a constant threat to opposition defence. Following his successful season, a lot of ISL clubs too had approached CCFC to buy the player.

The striker showed signs of his dazzling form this season too before getting injured last month with a side strain. “He is fit now and was ready to join practice. But the offer was too good to refuse,” the source said.

It was also told that the club isn’t seeking Manzi’s replacement right away. “The coach is in Singapore during the break. Once he returns, we will look for a replacement,” the source said.

CCFC are currently placed eighth in the I-League table with five points from five games. Their next game is away to Gokulam Kerala on January 9 while they start their AFC Cup campaign against Bahrain’s Al Riffa on January 14.

The decrepit, which has long been a dumping ground, is primed for a facelift.

The corporation is looking at a minimalist design for beautification — replete with bamboo installations.The part of the beach currently used as bamboo and timber marts will be fenced. The police housing wall running along the beach will be restored and the BMC will remove all kinds of encroachment, including illegal parking of trucks and water tankers. Toilets will be set up to prevent open-defecation.The beautification drive will also include creating pathways and an amphitheatre and the restoration of the Mahim fort.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner, G(north) ward, who had inspected the site, assured the residents that the beach would become a major tourist attraction.Dighavkar told Mirror, “We have approached Mumbai Port trust to convert it into a tourist spot. The beach offers an unfettered view of the Bandra-Worli Sealink. However, to sustain this project, we need citizen participation.”Architect Alan Abraham, who has designed the Mahim beach plan, told Mirror, “We have to work around a building in the middle of the beach, which belongs to the Coast Guard. Fencing the bamboo marts on the beach will restrict the spread of waste originating from these establishments. With the trucks and tankers gone, a lot of space will be freed up.”Abraham also said that a structural audit of the dilapidated police quarters along the beach will be conducted. “We want to build as little as possible to maintain the open space. However, cleaning up of the beach should actually begin at the very source of the problem, the Mithi River. The waste carried by the river washes up on the beach. Contractors must be hired for regular clean-up operations. Initially, we will import sand for the beach but once the area has been cleaned up, the existing sand will suffice,” he said.The beach will be dotted with benches and street lamps, he said. The BMC is also planning a little garden on the inside which will be completed by April. The Mahim fort, with its rich history, will be turned into a venue for a light-and-sound show, said the architect.Indranil Sengupta, a local resident whose clean-up drive on Mahim beach drew attention to the scale of the problem, will be part of the monitoring committee. “Finally, the BMC is convinced that this beach has potential and needs urgent attention,” he said.Rabia Tewari, another member of the committee, said, “The idea is to use sustainable material forthe space.”Both Sengupta and Tewari attributed the beautification efforts to the victory of a citizens’ movement that began two years ago.“We need to involve the Koli community living on the beach and keep in mind the round-the-year activities happening in the neighbourhood such as the,”said Tewari.Sengupta said the beach can also be used to host",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-815917,msid-73076938/73076938.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mahim-beach-to-don-a-new-look-by-april-2020/articleshow/73079384.cms

JAIPUR: With the opening ceremony, the fanfare over the first-ever State Games soon subsided, leaving a mammoth task at hand for the groundsmen to deliver a match-ready pitch for the Ranji Trophy match between Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh beginning January 3 at the SMS Stadium.

For the inauguration at the stadium, the stage was set in the outfield where horse show and march past were also held with participating students being seated right in the middle of the field of play.

The clip-clop of horse hooves against the manicured outfield and the damage caused because of setting the stage will have the groundsmen on their toes till midnight in spine-chilling cold, TOI has learnt. The pitch, though it was covered, saw youngsters ambling and sitting over it. Experts are of the belief that it takes more time in winter to get the ground ready and the groundsmen require 10-12 days to get the pitch match-ready.

Sources told TOI that the pitch curator for the Ranji match — Sunil Chauhan from Himachal — in his report to the BCCI has informed them about the State Games’ opening ceremony being held at the ground on the eve of the match.

While the ground was at the receiving end, the Games have come as a welcome sign for the upcoming sportspersons of the state. Giving a new lease of life to sports culture in Rajasthan, the first-ever State Games flagged off with a decent crowd in attendance.

268,['3/01/2020'],This Indian startup gave as much as 270% salary hike,"This story is from January 3, 2020

In Dream 11 , a gaming and sports startup based in India, employee can dream of getting a salary hike as high as by 270%. So, how does the startup operate? According to a report by Business Insider, one of the offbeat options the startup gives its employees is to set up their work targets themselves provided they reach the company target as a whole. All the teams in the startup, be they tech, marketing or product ones, are part of the “dream team” which is basically a pod structure where all the teams of the group work together in pods.

How the appraisals work

In Dream 11, the appraisals range from 15% to 270%. Employees are judged by their managers and coworkers both. Each employee is also judged by 25 coworkers each quarter based on parameters: data, user, performance, ownership and transparency. Dream 11 has got a total of 200 people working in the teams.The freedom to set your own goals and upto 270% salary hike comes with a caveat too. If the employee gets 7/10 on an average in the first quarter, he is given a warning. If he/she gets the same rating in the next two quarters, they are asked to leave the company. So, everything does not seem to be hunky-dory when the whole process of inducting an employee, the kind of result they turn in and the rating given by managers and coworkers is taken into account.

Harsh Jain, co-founder and CEO of Dream 11 told Business Insider in an interview: “We don’t believe in bell curve. The culture and philosophy of how we work is completely different. We don’t have things like OKR, KRA and KPI individually set across the organisation. We only have one thing, which is a team target. Either the entire company achieves the target or we don’t.”

“Everything is data driven for us. We do benchmarking of competitive companies which can poach from us. We see what they pay and then we pay at the 99th percentile,” Jain said in the interview.

270,['3/01/2020'],"Emulate your MG Road colleague, residents dare health inspectors","This story is from January 3, 2020

BENGALURU: Santosh Raj M, the Shanthalanagar junior health inspector who swung into action in the small hours of Wednesday to ensure residents in and around MG Road, Brigade Road and Church Street woke up to a spickand-span 2020 has turned a hero. Resident welfare associations (RWAs) elsewhere in the city are now throwing their respective health inspectors a challenge to fix their streets.

Raj and his staff had trooped on to the hub of New Year celebrations within hours of the revelry and cleared the three-km stretch of garbage. He had also dared The Ugly Indian (TUI), a volunteer group of anonymous citizens, to find black spots on the three roads. TUI was surprised as it couldn’t see even one.

Soon after TOI published the New Year feat of Raj and his colleagues on Thursday, impressed residents elsewhere in the city began challenging their health inspectors to follow suit. The feat and the challenge have been trending online.

Dr Hemant Kumar Agrawal, a resident of Domlur, said it’s very important to challenge BBMP officials to emulate their better-performing colleagues as at least that way they will start taking things seriously. “It should become a Bengaluru-wide challenge!” Agrawal said, adding: “Daily, we don’t come across such feats but it’s very important for BBMP to be challenged to see changes in the city.”

Priyanka Pillai, a resident of CV Raman Nagar , said all health inspectors should follow Raj and make him their role model. “If one health inspector could clean so much of trash, our health inspector can also take responsibility of the ward and do the same,” she said.

Somashekar S, junior health inspector of JP Park ward, said he’d be more than happy to accept the challenge. “I want to beautify black spots and ensure waste gets segregated. I would like to take up the challenge,” he said. Somashekar, however, added only health inspectors can’t be blamed for the state of affairs and people too need to do their bit to keep the city clean.

Harish P, a resident of Cubbonpet, had another point to make. “Firstly, we need to find out who our health inspector is and then think of challenging him. The Palike needs to hand over a list of health inspectors so that residents can bring problems to their notice,” he said.

Representative image

BENGALURU: The management discipline is gaining popularity among students seeking admission to the doctor of philosophy ( PhD ) programme in non-engineering subjects at Bangalore University this year.

According to BU officials, 361 candidates have applied for 12 slots of PhD in management (part of the commerce faculty), the highest among all subjects. Though the subject has always been popular among commerce and engineering students, a shift from IT to teaching jobs has led to the increase in PhD applications. While some hoping to get an assistant professor’s job write the National Eligibility Test and apply for the doctorate, others take the entrance exam to land the PhD seat.

The university received 3,738 applications this year for 482 PhD slots, more than a 100% jump from 2017 (the last time applications were invited), and 1,600-odd students applied. After management, Kannada received the second-highest applications

(243), followed by mathematics (127). The entrance exam held on December 29 was attended by 2,822 students across five centres in the city.

Experts say the increase in PhD aspirants reflects the waning popularity of engineering subjects and a growing affinity to teaching jobs, which are seen as better paying and more respectable.

Prof C Shivaraju, registrar of evaluation, BU, said the rise in number of applicants for management and commerce PhDs is being witnessed for some time now. “Besides showing a growing preference for teaching, it depicts a greater attraction to management courses. Students see the job of an assistant professor in management as more glamorous than any other subject,” he said.

BU has received 822 applications for 218 PhD vacancies in five engineering subjects. However, officials said the number has been declining.

CHANDIGARH: Akash Malik, who made history after clinching India's first silver in archery at the Youth Olympics in 2018, said he is sure that the Indian archery contingent will win a medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

Malik, who hails from Hisar in Haryana , said that the third edition of the Khelo India Youth Games will serve as good preparation for the Indian archery Olympic team trials. The Khelo India Youth Games will be held from January 10 to 22 in Guwahati.

""I am sure the Indian archery contingent will win a medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The players for the team will be selected through trials, which will be held early in 2020. The third edition of the Khelo India Youth Games in Guwahati will serve as a brilliant preparation for the trials,"" said Malik.

The promising archer had won gold (men's team event) at Asia Cup Stage-I, silver (mixed team event) and bronze (men's team event) in Asia Cup Stage-II in 2018. Malik expressed that he had a great experience while participating in the first edition of the Khelo India Games in 2018.

""I won bronze in the first edition of the Khelo India Games. I had a great time at the tournament. The competition is a great platform for the young athletes to learn different skills. The athletes get a lot of confidence while playing in the Khelo India Games environment,"" said Malik.

The 17-year-old, who is a farm labourer's son, developed an interest in archery after watching his friends practice the sport in 2016.

""I took up archery in 2016. I saw my friends practice archery in Hisar and then gradually I developed an interest in the sport,"" said Malik.

The archer faced financial difficulties to acquire equipments at the beginning of his career. However, the Olympic Gold Quest spotted Malik in 2017 and thereafter the organisation has been providing equipment to the young archer.

""Initially, I faced financial difficulties to acquire equipment because archery is an expensive sport. As I progressed in my career, I received financial assistance from Sports Authority of India, Khelo India Games and the Olympic Gold Quest. I had gone for the Asian Championships trials in 2017 and that's where I was spotted by the Olympic Gold Quest. Thereafter, the organisation started providing archery equipment to me,"" said Malik.

Online applications for medical stream shall be open for college managements on January 10, 2020.“While the government revised the fee structure for undergraduate courses, it failed to do so for post graduate medical and dental courses. Now, based on the financial statements of each college, TAFRC will fix fees for all courses, including super-speciality programmes,” said Laxman Rao, president of Telangana Private Medical and Dental Colleges Association. According to experts, the fee structure is likely to be revised by five to 10 per cent depending on the audited financial statements of colleges.As per notification issued by TAFRC recently, all private unaided professional colleges have been asked to submit their audited financial statements for the last three years to fix fee structure for block period 2020-2023. The last date for submission of online application along with audited financial statements is January 31. “Colleges that do not submit fee proposals or are unresponsive and do not submit relevant data shall not be permitted to collect any fee for the block period 2020-2023,” according to the notification.There are 21 private medical colleges and 11 private dental colleges in the state. The existing fee structure for MBBS in private non-minority colleges is ?11.55 lakh for B category seats and ?23.1 lakh for C category (NRI seats).",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73079551,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-267778,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/medical-dental-college-fees-likely-to-shoot-up-for-next-3-years/articleshow/73079574.cms

TimesView The annual Swachh survey is approaching but LMC is not prepared for it. City’s garbage management is in a dismal state. The issue of defunct machines in waste treatment plants is an old one and should have ideally been resolved by now. In such a situation, anybody can guess what rank the city would get in the survey. However, there is still a chance. A lot of ground can still be gained before survey begins on January 20 if the LMC and its private partner, instead of blame game, start working together on war footing to improve garbage collection and treatment.

LUCKNOW: Lucknow Municipal Corporation will have to pay a penalty of Rs 14.40 crore for environmental damage if it fails to revive the Shivri solid waste treatment plant in the next 15 days.The warning has been issued by Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) which has served a showcause notice on the civic body.Shivri plant, located on Kanpur Road, has been lying defunct for the past two months. It has led to accumulation of 2.5 lakh metric tonne waste near the plant.In its notice, UPPCB said the accumulated untreated waste near the plant is leading to air and water pollution in the vicinity, affecting about 300 residents of local village Lokhriya Kheda. LMC also has to reply to the notice within 15 days. Officials of Eco-Green, the company hired by LMC for running Shivri plant, said two of the three machines getting regularly stopped due to technical glitches but they do not have money for repair because LMC is yet to clear a major chunk of company’s arrears. Confirming the UPPCB notice, mayor Sanyukta Bhatia said orders have already been issued to Eco-Green to start the three machines of the shivri treatment plant by January 8. An Ecogreen official said, “LMC had assured us to provide money for the repair of machines, but we have not received a single penny yet. As soon as we get money, machines will get repaired.”",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73079602,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-149686,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknow-municipal-corporation-stares-at-rs-14-crore-fine-for-flouting-green-norms/articleshow/73079549.cms

287,['3/01/2020'],"Include Kurnool, Mantralayam in Karnataka: Former TDP MLA","This story is from January 3, 2020

RAICHUR: A former TDP legislator on Thursday urged the Union government to include Kurnool and temple town Mantralayam, which share border with Ballari and Raichur districts, in Karnataka since a majority of its population primarily speaks Kannada.

Palakurthi Tikkareddy is from Yemmiganur in Kurnool district and lost the 2019 assembly elections from Mantralayam to Y Balanagireddy of YSRCP (Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party).

The former MLA told reporters in Mantralayam, abode of Raghavendraswamy Mutt that attracts thousands of devotees mainly from Karnataka, that people from Kurnool district are Kannadigas at heart and most settlers were from neighbouring Ballari, Raichur and Kalaburgai districts.

The demand comes weeks after Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackery described Belagavi district as ‘Karnataka-occupied Maharashtra’, raising hackles from Karnataka. Similarly, Kasargod, a border district in Kerala, has language affinities with Karnataka, and erupts as an emotive issue every few years.

The former TDP MLA said it was “unfortunate” that Kurnool and Mantralayam were awarded to Andhra Pradesh during the reorganization of states on linguistic lines in 1956.

Palakurthi expressed apprehensions that a panel of experts formed by Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy would further alienate people of Kurnool because most of the administrative apparatus will shift farther afield to Amaravati and Visakhapatnam. “The only institution closer home will be the high court at Kurnool,” he said, justifying his demand for inclusion of Kurnool and Mantralayam in Karnataka.

Visakhapatnam and Amaravati are farther than Bengaluru in terms of distance. “Bengaluru is less than six hours by road from here, and this provides easy and faster access to administrative headquarters,” he said. He accused the Andhra Pradesh government of ignoring the development of Mantralayam.

By: TP SinghTwo decades ago, three operational platforms of the Chandigarh railway station would see a much larger number of goods trains than passenger trains. Looking back at those days, now I wonder how we would manage the flow. Interestingly, the platforms would be crowded with businessmen, who would be there not to board the train but to receive their merchandise for further supply in the region.Those days, the platforms of the railway station would also be bustling with coolies and representatives from companies, which not only called materials for construction but also perishable products. It was gratifying as the then yardmaster to see a goods train coach packed with perishable stuff being unloaded at my station that would cater to the needs of not only the city but the entire region.I used to discuss with my colleagues how this “goods train handling terminal” was popular with iron and steel producers for iron, cement and coal supply. The station would have two freight lines, as the movement of goods trains was quite high. But, gradually it declined and at present, we have only one freight line for the goods trains.Now there are 35 passenger trains and 30 for goods, while 20 years ago, there were only five trains for passengers, and 10 goods trains in Chandigarh. The railways would book a single coach instead of full rake to deliver the products, due to which the footfall of business community was greater.For the convenience of station superintendent (SS), power cabin and panel centre were located inside the station.",chandigarh,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73079652,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-749299,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/goods-trains-outnumbered-passenger-carriages-in-chandigarh/articleshow/73079663.cms

Kabir Suman attended a rally by Jatiya Bangla Sammelan on Thursday to protest against an alleged discriminator... Read More

KOLKATA: Students at Jadavpur University , who are either members of ABVP, a saffron students’ wing, or support BJP, have alleged discrimination by other students. They claimed they were bullied and boycotted when they went to attend classes.

Suranjan Sarkar, a firstyear student of mass communication at the university and assistant secretary of ABVP’s state unit, was allegedly boycotted by his classmates after the protest on campus during Babul Supriyo’s visit a few month’s ago and the vandalism that followed. “Whenever I tried to attend classes, they would walk out. Posters were put up, telling students not to attend any class with me. Even if I wanted to sit on the back bench, they would walk out. I was surprised at such behaviour when it came to studies. They might not agree with my political ideology, but why should they stop me from attending a lecture?” Sarkar said.

Suman Das, secretary of the ABVP’s Jadavpur unit , on Thursday claimed some of their members faced similar situations when their political ideologies came in conflict with others. Some were bullied when talking to their peer groups, while others were allegedly abused on the university campus. “They would be boycotted from classes or bullied outside. We have given a letter to the university’s vice-chancellor, Suranjan Das, with details of the problems the students have been going through,” said Das, who is pursuing PhD at the university. He alleged he had been subject to abuses owing to his political allegiance and that many of the targeted students kept quiet because they were afraid of a backlash from the students’ union.

The VC, however, denied having received any such communication from any student or students’ bodies. “I did not receive any such complaint till Thursday afternoon,” Suranjan Das said.

“We are not against any student. But if a student supports CAA and NRC and resorts to vandalism on the campus, his fellow students might not be able to accept his ways,” said Somasree Chowdhury, chairperson of Arts Faculty Students’ Union.

Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta on Wednesday tweeted about a Jadavpur University student who was not allowed to attend classes by his classmates who called him a fascist. “He said that his fellow students would not allow him to attend class because he could not be in the same class as a ‘fascist’. His professors told him that in endorsing BJP, he was being wilfully ‘provocative’,” Dasgupta tweeted.

Members of the Jadavpur University Teachers’ Association (JUTA), however, refuted the allegation. “We will not allow a student to be barred from a class. Students can have their own ideologies and can have issues with each other, but that can never affect his academic career. Jadavpur University has always accommodated diverse political ideologies. Faculty members will not discriminate against a student owing to his political leanings,” said Partha Pratim Roy, general secretary of the JUTA.

HYDERABAD: Telangana police ’s intelligence wing on Thursday tied up with a Gurugram-based start-up to provide solutions for crowd management, especially in mega events like Sammakka-Saralamma Jatara at Medaram, considered one of the biggest tribal fairs in Asia. Medaram Jatara will be held in February.

The tie-up was announced by Telangana intelligence officers and representatives of start-up Awiros in the presence of information technology minister KT Rama Rao on Thursday during an event held to declare 2020 as the Year of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Telangana.

The start-up would develop an application, which by using CCTV footage, would ascertain density of crowd at different public events. The application would be developed by using AI. Based on the analysis of the population gathering, the security personnel would get alerts so that they could take right decisions to manage the crowd in a better manner and avoid stampede and other chaotic situations.

“This application will help us in estimation of size of the crowd. For example, in events like Medaram Jatara, Kumbh Mela and other similar mega crowd-gathering events. It will help us know how the crowd behaves,’’ intelligence officials said.

The application was tested during the recently-held India-West Indies T20 International (T20I) at Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium at Uppal.

292,['3/01/2020'],Weight Loss: Let 2020 be the year of less sugar,"We all feel that we are not having enough sugar, barring the last week of the year, because heck, we were celebrating. But ask yourself in all genuinity, is that actually true? There is added sugar in your everyday packaged and processed foods, which goes uncounted. Moreover, cutting down on it does not require you to deprive yourself or go to extreme diets.Not many know that excess sugar in the diet activates the ageing process. And trust us when we say, it's harmful effects can be as bad as smoking and drinking alcohol.Coming to sugar, you may argue that even fruits have fructose (which is a form of sugar), but your body can process fructose that is consumed as part of a whole fruit. This is because along with natural sugar, your body is also getting fiber, which slows down the absorption of sugar in the bloodstream.However, what you eat and drink in the form of processed foods and packaged foods has sugar that is highly processed and is devoid of dietary fiber. There is good evidence that this fructose actually leads to addiction, which is harmful in the long run.To cut down sugar from your diet, it is best to cut out sugars in all forms for a minimum of 7 days. A lot of people felt that when they quit sugar for 7 days at a stretch, they were able to resist it better than before. And if you actually crave for it too much, pick a whole fruit instead of picking a processed sugar variety. Also start reading food labels while picking packaged foods. Also, do not be fooled by terms like honey, nectar, brown sugar or beet sugar, they all are added sugars, which should be avoided.Also, this by no standards mean you are eliminating sugar from your body, instead you are now getting it from healthy sources. If you can stick to this plan, cravings will fade sooner than you will ever know...

Khushboo Verma

LUCKNOW: An 11-year-old girl, who had to drop out of school in Class 5 last year, has cleared the IQ test for Class 9 conducted by the state secondary education board. If all goes well, she will get direct admission to the ninth grade in a government school in the next academic session.

Daughter of a mason, Khushboo Verma couldn’t continue her studies at a private school in Aishbagh after completing Class 4 in 2018 owing to financial constraints. But, her knack for learning kept her going. She coached at home under her uncle, Ram Kumar Verma, who teaches at a government college. Within a year, the little girl had every lesson till Class 9 on her fingertips.

“It was her keen interest in studying further that made me take out time from my busy schedule to teach her. Since she is well-versed in the ninth grade syllabus, I wrote several letters to UB Secondary Education Board (UPSEB) so that she could get admitted to Class IX at least in a government school,” said Ram Kumar.

UPSEB officials agreed to test her on her uncle’s request and it goes without saying that she came out with flying colours. District inspector of schools, Lucknow, Mukesh Kumar Singh said, “Following a directive from UPSEB, we tested her English, Hindi and science skills, among others. She scored well. Her report card has been sent to the board.”

Khushboo reminds one of child prodigy Sushma Verma, who was only five when she enrolled in Class 9. She had cleared Class XII board exams at the age of 10 and bagged a place in the Limca Book of Records for being the youngest to finish school in Lucknow.

Sushma completed BSc with zoology and botany from CMS Girls’ Degree College, under Lucknow University, and then joined an MSc course in microbiology at Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University (BBAU). She emerged the topper and was awarded a medal by the PM in 2016. She is currently pursuing her PhD in environmental microbiology at BBAU.

LUCKNOW: The female voice in the leaked audio clips that exposed the LLB paper leak in Lucknow University matched that of the woman accused in the case, UP STF stated in its probe report.

In its 35-page inquiry report submitted to the UP government on Wednesday evening, the Special Task Force said the accused woman student’s voice sample matched with the female voice in the audio clips during forensic tests. The state home department will decide on further action based on STF report.

The report further confirmed that a male voice heard in the audio clips was of then officiating LU vice-chancellor SK Shukla, but he was not heard leaking any law question in the clips. “We recorded statements of 35 persons, including the accused woman student, LU law professors, then VC, examination department officers and owner of the private college where the accused woman student appeared in the exam,” officiating SSP STF Vishal Vikram Singh told TOI.

The two accused law teachers admitted during probe that the male voices heard in the clips were theirs, but claimed they were only explaining the syllabus and not dictating questions which were supposed to come in the LLB semester III exam, said DySP, Special Task Force, PK Mishra. The accused woman student had denied that the female voice was hers, he added.

Also, as reported by TOI earlier, STF in its report stated that 50% of the questions dictated by two law teachers to the student in the clips appeared in the LU law examinations.

On December 11, six audio clips of telephonic conversations between a woman LLB student and two LU teachers and others went viral on social media. The accused woman, who is the manager of a private hospital, is a law student (semester III) in a private college in Lucknow.

In one clip, she was heard asking then LU VC (SK Shukla) to help her in law examinations, while in another clip she requested the owner of a private college, where she had to appear for the law paper, to make separate seating arrangement during examination. In other clips, she was heard taking down questions from two LU law teachers.

Besides, sources said, this meeting with commissioners of state tax and chief commissioners of central tax will also deliberate on enhancing GST compliance by plugging loopholes and discourage tax evaders, those gaming or misusing the system.

The meeting assumes significance as the GST Council in its last meeting held on December 18 wanted a detailed study on these issues before taking any call on rate hike on items.

Meanwhile, in an encouraging sign, the GST collection for December came in at around Rs 1.03 lakh crore. Sources said, this multi-faceted brainstorming meeting is being organised with the purpose of curbing fraud and evasion, checking fake or huge input tax credit claims, seeking bank account details of businesses to tally with their filings, misuse of refund and sharing best practices in revenue augmentation.

MUMBAI: The MVA government will set up nutritious meal centres at all district headquarters and several public places to provide a total of 18,000 Shiv Bhojan Thalis to the poor at Rs 10 in the first phase. Those working in state establishments will not be entitled to the subsidised meal, according to a government resolution (GR) issued on Thursday.

The government has allotted Rs 6.4 crore for the first phase, which will be a pilot for three months. In Mumbai, 450 subsidised thalis will be served in the island city and up to 1,500 in the suburbs, according to the food and civil supplies department.

The scheme, which was promised by Shiv Sena as part of its poll manifesto, will be launched after contracts are awarded for the centres. Besides collector offices, centres will also be set up at district hospitals, bus stations, railway stations and government offices which are visited by the poor or labourers.

Eateries such as Khanaval (home-made food eateries), women self-help groups, bhojanalayas, restaurants and NGOs that run eateries will be eligible to set up the centres. They should have seating arrangement for at least 25 people and would serve 75 to 150 thalis a day. Committees to be set up under collectors at district level and under tehsildars at taluka level will select the eateries.

The government has pegged the cost of the thalis at Rs 50 in urban areas and Rs 35 cost in rural areas. So to provide meal to the poor at Rs 10, the state will reimburse contractors Rs 40 per plate in urban areas and Rs 25 in rural areas.

Bhaskar Jadhav

MUMBAI: Shiv Sena legislator Bhaskar Jadhav on Thursday expressed unhappiness over his non-inclusion in the cabinet. “I was expecting a cabinet berth but I have been left out. I have sought an appointment with Uddhav Thackeray to know for myself why I was denied a cabinet berth,” he said.

On the eve of the assembly election, Jadhav joined the Shiv Sena and won from Guhagar in Ratnagiri district. In 2014, Jadhav was elected an NCP legislator.

“I was in the NCP when I was told by Thackeray that I will be inducted in the state cabinet if I joined the Shiv Sena. Accordingly, on the specific assurance of Thackeray, I joined the Sena. Shockingly, I have been left out in the cabinet expansion. Since all the vacancies have been filled up, there is no scope for expansion in future,” Jadhav said.

Jadhav said he did not quit NCP and join Sena only to become a legislator. “Earlier, too, I was a legislator. I joined the Shiv Sena only on the assurance of a cabinet berth. The assurance was given by none other than Thackeray himself,” he said.

On whether his cabinet induction was opposed by NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Jadhav said Pawar would never do so. ”I have full faith in Sharad Pawar,” he said.

LUCKNOW: Around 6,602 acre of Rs 660 crore has been found to be illegally occupied in Sonbhadra and Mirzapur by largely cooperative committees.

This was revealed on Thursday in a report submitted to chief minister Yogi Adityanath by the Renuka Kumar Committee, which was set up after the Umbha violence in which 11 villagers were massacred over a land dispute on July 17 last year. It has recommended that the report be sent to the cooperative department for further action.

The committee, set up in August 2019 under the chairmanship of additional chief secretary (revenue) Renuka Kumar, to probe Krishi Sehkari Samities. A report by the forest department is yet to be submitted.

The committee investigated 39 cooperative committees in Sonbhadra and Mirzapur and did not find records for three. Records between 1952 and 2019 were looked at. Out of the seven committees that have been found to be occupying government land illegally, at least one belongs to a senior Congress leader.

Three committees are located in Sonbhadra. These are Mensvar Krishi Cooperative Committee, Perh Krishi Cooperative Committee and Baraudhi Krishi Cooperative Committee. In Mirzapur, four committees were violating rules. These are Gopalpur Krishi Cooperative Committee, Bahori Krishi Cooperative Committee, Mewari Krishi Cooperative Committee and Patehara Krishi Cooperative Committee.

A senior official in the CM office said that as per the report, 19,880 bighas of land was investigated, of which 10,569 bighas or 6,602 acres, was found to be recoverable. “Most of this land is either ceiling or belongs to gram sabhas. The government will start the process of retrieving this land at the earliest,” said the official.

The report has recommended action against two specific persons, a tehsildar and a naib tehsildar. While no district magistrate has been mentioned in the report, the matter of land allotment took place at the SDM and ADM levels and it will be up to the cooperative department to assess who all have been responsible for the illegalities, said sources.

The report has also raised questions over the conduct of revenue department officials, who either allowed the illegal transactions to take place or who did not react when anomalies came up which would have brought the matter to light much earlier.

What thickens the mystery shrouding Rabindranath Ghosh’s death is that his youngest son, Ajit (40), who is mentally disabled, has gone missing.Around 11am, Ghosh’s eldest son, Ashok (45), an Eastern Railway employee, found his father’s body.Parnasree police said Ajit, who was last seen at home on Wednesday, is yet to be traced.“Ghosh, senior executive of a private firm, had retired more than one and a half decades ago. He used to live with Ajit. His elder son, Ashok, who stays a few blocks away, had left the city a few days ago and returned on Thursday morning. After returning to the city, when Ashok went to meet his father, he saw the main door of the house was open. He found that the octogenarian was lying dead in the house and his brother was missing,” said a police officer.“The preliminary postmortem report revealed that Ghosh had died at least four days ago. That means Ajit had stayed in the same room with his father’s body for more than two days. May be, he could not bear the stench and left the house. But Ajit has had a history of leaving the house and returning after some days,” said Murlidhar Sharma, joint CP (crime).Police have registered a case and started a probe to ascertain the exact cause of his death. “So far, we have not found anything missing from the house. The autopsy surgeon believes that he had been suffering from acute tuberculosis for some time,” said a police source. Cops will speak to Ashok to trace his younger brother. “Neighbours noticed Ajit till January 1. We are checking CCTV footage for leads,” said the police officer.The detective department sleuths are expected to visit the spot where Ghosh’s decomposed body was found.

KOLKATA: The anti-FICN team of special task force (STF) seized fake Indian currency with a face value of Rs 7 lakh and arrested Krishna Mandal (42), a resident of Malda’s Kaliachak area, from Park Circus Maidan on Thursday.

On a tip-off cops had intercepted Mondal at the Park Circus Maidan area around 11.40am on Thursday. Later, they arrested him from the spot around 4.05pm. He will be produced in the court on Friday.

The fake currency recovered from Mandal’s possession comprised 100 notes of Rs 2,000 denomination and 1,000 notes of Rs 500 denomination. Preliminary probe has revealed that Mandal is an FICN racketeer. Officials will interrogate him further to know more about the racket’s modus operandi.

Cops noticed a rise in fake Rs 500-notes. The face value of the fake currency seized by STF last year was over Rs 1crore — almost 1.5 times that of 2018 and six times that recovered in 2017. Besides, 41 fake note racketeers were nabbed last year, which was almost double the arrests made in 2018.

Gujarat high court

AHMEDABAD: Can a woman drag a man to court under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act after her divorce, and when she had already married someone else? She cannot, said the Gujarat high court on the ground that the woman cannot be termed as an aggrieved person under the concerned act in such a case.

In an important judgment, Justice Umesh Trivedi said, ""Once the marital tie is severed by way of divorce between the parties the relationship between them is snapped... the wife would be aggrieved person so long as domestic relationship survives. As soon as it is snapped, it is an end to the domestic relationship and she would not be aggrieved person then.""

The court further said, ""After divorce between two persons, neither the domestic relationship survives nor any person would be termed as an aggrieved person for the purpose of this (DV) Act. Hence, after divorce takes place between husband and wife, the provisions under the Act cannot be invoked.""

The case is from Surendranagar town. Kanji Parmar and Urmila had wed in 1984. Parmar filed for divorce in 1989. The couple settled their dispute and formally divorced in 1990. Later, Urmila wed one Premji Tundiya.

Twenty-seven years later, Urmila slapped two cases on Parmar when he was on the verge of retirement from BSNL. Parmar's advocate Ashvin Gateshaniya said that the woman sought maintenance from Parmar with an eye on his retirement benefits. She filed for maintenance in Surendranagar family court under Section 125 of CrPC as well as under the DV act by claiming herself to be an aggrieved person due to the domestic relationship that once existed.

The family court rejected Urmila's application for maintenance after Parmar showed proof of her second marriage. However, a magisterial court took cognizance of her complaint under the DV act and started proceedings after accepting her claim to be an aggrieved person in a domestic relationship.

After hearing the case, the HC said, ""There is irresistible conclusion that divorced wife who has remarried cannot invoke provisions of ""the Act"" against her erstwhile husband.""

What is Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana

Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) is a central sector scheme with 100% funding from the government. It was announced in the Budget 2019-20 on February 1, 2019. Under the scheme, Rs 6,000 will be given per year to small and marginal farmer families having combined land holding/ownership of upto 2 hectares. How farmers will receive the money

The amount will be given in three installments of Rs 2,000 each. It will be transferred directly to the bank account of beneficiaries through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). DBT will ensure transparency in the entire process and will save time for the farmers. How small and marginal farmers will benefit

It is estimated that the scheme will benefit more than 12 crore small and marginal farmers (SMFs). The PM-KISAN scheme aims to supplement the financial needs of the SMFs in procuring various inputs to ensure proper crop health and appropriate yields, commensurate with the anticipated farm income at the end of the each crop cycle. This would also protect them from falling in the clutches of moneylenders for meeting such expenses and ensure their continuance in the farming activities. PM-KISAN is effective from which date?

As per PM-KISAN website, the Scheme is effective from December 1, 2018 to eligible beneficiaries. The state governments and UT Administration will identify the farmer families which are eligible for support as per scheme guidelines. Who are not eligible for the scheme

The following categories of beneficiaries of higher economic status shall not be eligible for benefit under the scheme: (a) All institutional land holders. (b) Farmer families in which one or more of its members belong to following categories: i) Former and present holders of constitutional posts ii) Former and present ministers/state ministers and former/present members of Lok Sabha/Rajya Sabha/State Legislative Assemblies/State Legislative Councils, former and present mayors of Municipal Corporations, former and present chairpersons of District Panchayats. iii) All serving or retired officers and employees of Central/state government ministries/offices/departments and its field units Central or state PSEs and attached offices/autonomous institutions under the government as well as regular employees of the local bodies (excluding multi tasking staff/Class IV/Group D employees). vi) All superannuated/retired pensioners whose monthly pension is Rs 10,000 or more (excluding multi tasking staff/Class IV/Group D employees) of above category. v) All Persons who paid Income Tax (I-T) in last assessment year vi) Professionals like doctors, engineers, lawyers, chartered accountants, and architects registered with professional bodies and carrying out profession by undertaking practices.

What they do at the fitness party

Is getting up early part of your new year plan? Don’t just head out for a morning walk or run. Go party, instead! Yes, you heard right. We don’t mean it in the traditional sense, but we’re talking of fitness-infused social gatherings that see you bust the calories in your stylish spandex . Fast gaining popularity around the globe with the health-conscious, they’re big in Mumbai, too. Says organiser Grishma Jain, “These are detox-dance-wellness parties where we merge the old-school wisdom of yoga with high-energy dance workouts. For those who find taking the first step towards fitness tough, it brings them towards that by adding fun to a completely fitness oriented concept.” The workouts are power-packed alright. The dance moves folks them into a sweat and burn calories. Adds Grishma, “It takes them through a journey of release and stress busting in a party environment. Think of it as a first step towards being fit.”The two-hour sessions take place at sunrise or sunset (post office hours) so the usual excuses of not making time to attend won’t work here. The venue could be a co-working space, a nightclub or an open-air terrace. In each one, a trainer briefs the class on what they are about to do. “Around 150 people sign up per session and it’s like a whole community coming together. Healthy foods and drinks are served post the session,” she adds. For Mumbaikars , this is making for a fun grab.RD National College student Avantika Bhosle, who is a regular at these fitness parties , says, “I am not someone who likes to go to a gym and workout. I want something unique and these parties fit right in. Everyone is so enthusiastic that the vibe just rubs off on you. It’s also a great place to make friends, as we all have similar preferences and goals.”Andheri-based diamond merchant Jinesh Jain attended a session at Lower Parel. “I love dancing, so I signed up for a class. We did a mix of workouts and after getting into a sweat, we headed to a juice bar.

HYDERABAD: A total of 1,260 dark spots were identified in the city. Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation ( GHMC ) has proposed to install new 9,500 street lights and 3,500 new electric poles in these poorly lit places.“Around 100 more locations will be added this week,” said a GHMC official.The locations were identified after Municipal Administration and Urban Development (MAUD) Minister K T Rama Rao instructed GHMC to install additional street lights soon after the vet rape case. “The date will be furnished along with the required budget to GHMC commissioner DS Lokesh Kumar and the works will be taken up at zonal level. The works will be completed by six months,” said a GHMC official.According to the records, most of the dark spots are located in GHMC peripheral areas which also include city’s IT corridor. Khajaguda Chowrasta to ORR, MIG Colony (BHEL) and Kavuri Hills are some of the places identified by the civic body in the IT corridor. As per records, other peripheral areas include parts of LB Nagar, Alwal, Rajenderanagar, Uppal and Malkagiri.“The area around the government land located in TNGOs colony falling under Gachibowli police station limits is poorly lit.

Representative image

PUNE: Should everything go according to plan, the temple town of Alandi will get drinking water in the next six months.

The Alandi Municipal Council plans to create a supply junction in the Bhama Askhed water pipeline being laid by Pune Municipal Corporation .

“This project will address the existing drinking water crisis permanently,” AMC chief officer Samir Bhumkar told TOI on Monday.

Bhumkar said AMC has floated a tender for the project. “We are in the final stages of awarding a work order to a private agency. We will complete this process in the next few weeks before starting the actual work at Kuruli,” he added.

Despite being among the prominent pilgrim towns — thousands come here every day to to visit the Sant Dnyaneshwar Maharaj temple — Alandi has been grappling with a water crisis for several years. At the moment, citizens get water drawn from Indrayani river , which is polluted nearly through the year.

This has forced most local citizens to buy water cans. A significant chunk of the population, meanwhile, most of the financially weak, drink the water from Indrayani.

A team of experts from Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran has studied the project over the past few months and based on their findings, AMC prepared submitted a proposal to the urban development department, which sanctioned it, AMC officials said.

“The town currently requires 7 million litres of water (MLD) a day. Considering the growing population and the town’s expansion, PMC has agreed to provide 10 MLD to us,” Bhumkar added.

As a part of the project, water from Bhama Askhed will be treated at the filtration plant in Alandi before being supplied.

“Since we have replaced old pipelines in the past three years, we will be able to supply water at the required pressure and cover entire 2.73 sqkm network of the town,” Bhumar said.

As per the 2011 census, 28,000 people lived in Alandi. Estimates peg that number now at 33,000.

Citizens and activists said the work should be completed in a timely manner.

“Neither politicians nor the district administration paid heed to the water crisis in the past two decades. Now, they should ensure completion of this project on time,” lawyer-activist Vilas Kate said.

327,['3/01/2020'],Hyderabad: 150 industries to get land in phase 1 of Pharma City,"This story is from January 3, 2020

Representational Image

HYDERABAD: With the Centre granting the National Investment Manufacturing Zone ( NIMZ ) status to Hyderabad Pharma City , the Telangana government is now going ahead with its plans to allot land to as many as 150 firms in phase I.

The Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation ( TSIIC ) has already acquired about 8,500 acres for the Pharma City project, which is coming up at Mucherla in Rangareddy district on the outskirts of Hyderabad.

Senior officials said 350 firms had approached the government seeking land in Pharma City. “Initially, land will be allotted to 150 pharma units. Several pharma associations are queuing up for allotment of land. We will launch the application process soon and allotment will be made directly to individual companies,” principal secretary, industries, Jayesh Ranjan told TOI on Thursday.

A couple of days ago, industries minister KT Rama Rao had revealed that Pharma City would be operationalised this year. Top sources in the government said once infrastructure facilities are in place, the process of land allotment would be completed before May this year.

The government is speeding up the Pharma City project as all the required permissions, including environmental clearance, have already been granted by the Centre. Though the project was conceived in 2015, it took four years to get the clearances.

Ten days ago, Union industry minister Piyush Goyal set the ball rolling by asserting that the Centre had granted its final approval for the project by giving it NIMZ status. In fact, the Centre approved NIMZ status to Pharma City in January 2016 but kept it on hold.

Earlier, the Telangana industries department submitted a techno-economic feasibility study and development plan report for getting the final approval. Based on the reports, the final approval was granted in the second week of December.

The government had taken Rs 750 crore loan from Hudco, while KTR had written letters to the Centre seeking Rs 3,418 crore for creation of a full-fledged Pharma City in the form of a grant, besides allotment of natural gas on a preferential tariff basis for use as fuel by pharma units.

“The Telangana government asked for a grant-in-aid of Rs 1,318 crore for creation of infrastructure, besides Rs 2,100 crore, which will be half the expenditure to be incurred for creation of internal infrastructure and common effluent treatment plants,” a senior official said.

AHMEDABAD: Forest department officials on Thursday arrested a 50-year-old woman and a 13-year-old boy from their home in Darji village, for allegedly poaching migratory birds from Nalsarovar lake, Gujarat 's only Ramsar site. The department recovered 41 live birds from them.

Deputy conservator of forests Brajish Chaudhari said the two, Lila Padhar and the 13-year-old, were arrested from their village on the basis of a tip off. The boy's family were not at home.

He said 36 of the birds were found at the residence of Padhar, and three of them were injured. The 33 other birds were released at the lake. Five birds were found at the boy's home and they were also released back into the wild.

The officer said Padhar was earlier also found to be involved in poaching. In 2018, a video had gone viral showing her carrying a migratory bird. Forest department officials had been looking out for her.

During the interrogation of the duo, they said they had poached the birds for their own consumption. ""The recovery of 36 birds raised questions about whether they were selling these birds to eateries,"" he said.

A senior forest department official said that this is the second time such birds have been found at the homes of poachers. Around Diwali time, when the birds had started arriving, the forest department had recovered some birds from the residences of two other poachers in the same village.

The officer said the modus operandi was simple, a net was tied on the banks of the Nalsarovar lake and when the birds were disturbed they would fly into the net and get trapped.

The department recovered 12 gadwalls, two wigeons, two garganey teals, six shovelers, two purple moorhens, five pintails and four common teals, among others.

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: Building houses in cities and towns under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna (Urban) - PMAY (U) is getting visible traction. Gujarat now ranks second after Uttar Pradesh when it comes to completing homes under the scheme.

Construction of 3.69 lakh homes has been completed in Gujarat under PMAY (U) as on December 27, 2019. As against this, merely 1.66 lakh homes had been completed in the same period of 2018, real estate consultancy firm Anarock Property Consultants said citing data from the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs.

""Another 3.32 lakh homes are already occupied by scheme beneficiaries as on 2019-end,"" the consultant added. ""Gujarat's progress in completing homes under PMAY (U) is far better than Uttar Pradesh when considered in terms of population and urban growth,"" said Jaxay Shah, chairman, CREDAI-National.

""CREDAI as a national body of real estate developers has played a crucial role in encouraging affordable housing across the country,"" Shah added.

Nationally, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh together contributed nearly 35% of the total 32 lakh homes completed under the PMAY (U) scheme.

""Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh are clear winners with nearly 11.22 lakh homes completed in these three states by the end of 2019. Last year at this point, these three had just 3.62 lakh homes completed,"" Anarock added.

As far as UP is concerned, it saw completion of nearly 4.30 lakh homes by 2019-end as compared to just 68,660 units exactly a year ago. Andhra Pradesh ranks third with over 3.23 lakh homes completed in the state by 2019-end, as against around 1.27 lakh homes completed in the same time frame in 2018.

""In 2015, the government announced its intention of building approximately 1.12 crore homes under PMAY (U) by 2022, of which nearly 92% have already been sanctioned as on the end of 2019. Timely construction remains a challenge, but the introduction of new and effective technologies, such as prefabricated construction, can help achieve this target within the stipulated deadline,"" said Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock.

PUNE: A 22-year-old hotel employee’s mindfulness helped the police arrest an autorickshaw driver and his accomplice on the charge of threatening and robbing the staffer during the early hours of Wednesday in Thergaon.

The duo robbed the youth — Omkar Ghadage of Bhosari — of his valuables worth Rs 14,200 when Ghadage was on his way home.

“Ghadage, an employee of a hotel along the Katraj-Dehu Road Bypass, was working until the wee of Wednesday. Around 2.45am, he left his place of work for home. He boarded an autorickshaw which dropped him at Kalewadi,” sub-inspector of the Wakad police Shambhu Ranaware told TOI.

Ranware said Ghadage then boarded an another autorickshaw from Kalewadi Phata, being driven by Akash Kampa (23) of Pimpri. “Kampa, who has a previous criminal record, was driving his friend’s autorickshaw that night. His accomplice, Swapnil Chandanshive (21) of Kalewadi, was with him. Ghadage requested the duo to take him to Bhosari,” he said.

The officer said after driving for some distance, Kampa routed the autorickshaw to a secluded lane near a departmental store in Thergaon. “The duo then threatened Ghadage that they would hack him to death and robbed him of his cellphone, wallet, wristwatch and bagpack,” Ranaware said, adding, “They then forced Ghadage to sit inside the vehicle and resumed driving.”

Although terrified, a mindful Ghagade asked the driver to stop the vehicle, saying that he wanted to answer nature’s call. “As soon as the driver stopped, Ghadage jumped out of the vehicle and fled the scene. He managed to note down the vehicle’s registration number before that,” Ranaware said.

He said registration number helped the police to trace the autorickshaw driver and his accomplice. “The duo have been remanded to the police custody for three days,” Ranware added.

AHMEDABAD: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has enlisted the support of schoolchildren in Ahmedabad for its 'India supports CAA' campaign, which it says aims to counter the 'misinformation' campaign carried out by the opposition against the new law.

On Thursday, students of as many as 15 schools in and around Ghatlodia participated in the party's campaign to create awareness on the Citizenship Amendment Act, (CAA), 2019.

Students from these schools wrote postcards to Prime Minister Narendra Modi . They acknowledged the good work done by the Prime Minister in enacting the law, which grants fast track Indian citizenship in five years to religious minorities from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, who had to flee their homeland due to persecution.

Blank postcards were distributed by BJP workers to schools earlier this week, said sources.

At Tripada School in Ghatlodia, 800 students wrote letters appreciating CAA. The school's principal, Archit Bhatt, said members of the BJP had approached them on Wednesday and sought the help of their students. ""We explained to the students the benefits of CAA. The postcards were provided by BJP members,"" said Bhatt. The party held a meeting under Ghatlodia MLA Bhupendra Patel, where it was decided to rope in schools for the 'India supports CAA' campaign.

Representative image

MUMBAI: The BMC goes after small things while ignoring big concerns, said the Bombay high court on Thursday as it rapped the municipal corporation for wanting to demolish a small platform on which a generator is placed in a highrise in Wadala (east).

The court heard a petition by Wadala Heights Cooperative Housing Society, which comprises two wings with 32 floors each and 240 flats. Its petition stated that on June 14, 2016, with government permission, a diesel generator was installed on a cement platform “some four to five inches from the ground” for the lifts.

On July 21, 2016, the FNorth ward office issued a stop-work notice for the construction and a week later rejected the society explanation. The society moved the high court, which stayed the notice on August 2, 2016.

Society advocate Rajeev Panday said to a bench of Justice Shahrukh Kathawalla and Justice Burgess Colabawalla that “it is just a threeinch concrete platform to keep the generator and BMC has issued notice for illegal construction”. The BMC advocate said it was not in the sanctioned plan and that the society should get it regularised.

“This is ridiculous. Small things you’ll (BMC) go after, big things you leave,” Justice Colabawalla said.

The BMC advocate said the municipal corporation would see whether the platform could be regularised. “Not see. You should regularise it,” Justice Kathawalla said.

NEW DELHI: It seems that the new year has not started on a good note for Xiaomi. As per a recent report, tech giant Google has disabled the access of Xiaomi devices to its Nest Hub and Assistant. The company took this decision after a user reported that he is seeing still images from a stranger's security camera.

According to a report by Android Police, a user took to Reddit and revealed that his recently purchased Xiaomi Mijia 1080p Smart IP security camera was showing some still images from strangers' homes when he tried to stream from the camera to a Google Nest Hub. The report further added that the Reddit user saw images of an enclosed porch, a man sleeping in the chair, a baby sleeping in the cradle.

After the incident a Google Spokesperson said in a statement, ""We’re aware of the issue and are in contact with Xiaomi to work on a fix. In the meantime, we’re disabling Xiaomi integrations on our devices.""

Last year it was reported that Google has banned the 'Quick apps' by Xiaomi as part of company's Play Protect policy. For those unaware, Google was not allowing the Xiaomi users to update the Quick Apps by Xiaomi using the system app updater. Whenever a user tried to do that they were greeted with a popup from Play Protect saying, ""This app can collect data that could be used to track you.""

This was the second time when the Quick Apps from Xiaomi came under the scanner. Later Xiaomi issued a statement on the matter and said that it is in talks with the company to resolve the issue. The Chinese manufacturer also stated that its Quick Apps are completely safe to use.

People parking their vehicles at the facility will not have to cross the new airport road to get to the airport premises. Instead, the second floor of the facility will be connected to the terminal building through a skywalk,” said Pune MP Girish Bapat , who presided over the Pune Airport Advisory Committee meeting.

Airport director Ajay Kumar said that the land adjacent to parking number-1was being developed so that parking could be shifted to the new plot when it is ready. “For some time,therewillbesome issues as the new placefor parking is getting ready. While a section in parking number-1willbe reserved for parking during this time, some more space will be reserved at parking number-2 that is currently a pickup point for cabs and autorickshaws. Once the infrastructure on the new plot is ready, there will be no problems at all,” said Kumar.

“The length of the skywalk should be about 200 meters. So, it has been decided to install a travelator, or a moving walkway, so that passengers do not face any hassles as they walk with their luggage. The project has been delayed a bit due to land issues but now it is on track,” Kumar added.

342,['3/01/2020'],Corporate affairs min says no illegality in conversion of Tata Sons into pvt co; NCLAT reserves order,"This story is from January 3, 2020

Ratan Tata (left) and Cyrus Mistry (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The ministry of corporate affairs on Friday told the company law appellate court that it did not commit any illegality in granting permission to convert Tata Sons -- the holding company of the $110 billion salt-to-software conglomerate -- into a private company.

The submission was made before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) during the course of hearing on a petition filed by Registrar of Companies (RoC) that seeks modifications in the tribunal's December 18, 2019 judgment reinstating Cyrus Mistry as the executive chairman of Tata Sons.

A two-member bench of the NCLAT headed by chairman justice S J Mukhopadhaya, which reserved its order on the RoC's petition, said it will clarify that the December 18 judgement does not cast aspersions on the RoC and indicated that its order is likely to come on Monday next week.

Last month, the NCLAT set aside the RoC decision allowing conversion of Tata Sons into a private company.

During the proceedings on Friday, the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) said it was only discharging its duty and has not committed any illegality in the conversion of Tata Sons from a public company to a private company.

Director prosecution, representing the MCA, informed the appellate tribunal that after amendment in 2015, there is no such requirement of any minimum prescribed share capital for conversion of companies from public to private ones.

""Nothing has been prescribed. There is no requirement. This has been done for ease of doing business,"" said the MCA official.

The MCA also said that RoC Mumbai was ""duty-bound"" to change the status, over such a request and there was no hurry from its part in the conversion of Tata Sons from a public to a private company.

However, on this, the bench said, ""Hurry was not from your part. It was from their own part (Tata).

""Your help was in that ... hurriedly changed with the board of directors"" said the NCLAT.

Further, the appellate tribunal said the RoC cannot challenge its finding observations in the judgement before it.

""You are challenging the finding observation (of December 18 judgement). You go and challenge it before the Supreme Court. Your action challenging is prejudicial,"" said the NCLAT.

The appellate tribunal also clearly told the MCA that it was not making any aspersions against the RoC.

""We are not making any aspersions against you. These are our findings. We are not saying anything malafide against you. Your apprehensions are unfounded,"" said the NCLAT, ""You can't ask for a change for just seeking a change"".

Going a step further, the NCLAT also observed, ""Your arguments seem that you are arguing for a company ... You are arguing as a mouthpiece of a company. Don't plead like that"".

NCLAT member (Judicial) Justice Bansi Lal Bhat, who was also part of the two-member bench, observed, ""This is for the first time we are seeing that a director prosecution is acting like defence"".

On December 18, the NCLAT directed the $110-billion Tata group to reinstate Cyrus Mistry as the executive chairman of Tata Sons.

Tata Sons and Ratan Tata have separately moved the Supreme Court against the NCLAT order.

In its order passed on December 18, NCLAT termed the appointment of N Chandrasekaran, as ""illegal"" following the October 2016 sacking of Mistry as Tata Sons' executive chairman. It had also directed the RoC to reverse Tata Sons' status from a 'private company' to a 'public company'.

The appellate tribunal had also quashed the conversion of Tata Sons -- the principal holding company and promoter of Tata firms -- into a private company from a public one and had termed it as ""illegal"".

It had said the action taken by the RoC to allow the firm to become a private company was against the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, and 'prejudicial' and 'oppressive' to the minority member (Mistry camp).

In an urgent application, which was mentioned on December 23, RoC Mumbai had asked the appellate tribunal ""to carry out requisite amendments"" of its judgement ""to correctly reflect the conduct of the RoC Mumbai as not being illegal and being as per the provisions of the Companies Act"".

In its plea, the RoC, which functions under the MCA, sought to be impleaded as a party in the two petitions and deletion of the words ""illegal"" and ""with the help of the RoC"" used by the NCLAT in its judgement.

Besides, it also urged the tribunal ""to delete the aspersions made regarding any hurried help accorded by the RoC Mumbai to Tata Sons, except what was statutorily required"" in para 181 of the order.

The RoC also said it has acted in ""bonafide manner"" in converting the status of Tata Sons as ""there was no stay granted by this appellate tribunal on the operation of the judgement dated July 9, 2018, of Mumbai, NCLT, at the time when this intimation was filed by Tata Sons Ltd"".

Months after Mistry was sacked, Tata Sons received its shareholders' nod in September 2017, to convert itself into a private limited company from a public limited company, thereby absolving it of the need to take shareholder consent in taking crucial decisions, which could be passed with just the board's approval.

Tata Sons was initially a 'private company', but after insertion of Section 43A (1A) in the Companies Act, 1956, on the basis of average annual turnover, it assumed the character of a deemed 'public company' with effect from February 1, 1975, the order said.

MUMBAI: A day after a history-sheeter was detained on the suspicion that he had pushed a polio-afflicted woman in a wheelchair out of Gujarat Express train on December 13, the local crime branch of the railway police arrested him on Thursday. The accused, Aslam Umar (45), will soon undergo identification parade, said sources.

The victim, Nagma Ansari (31), a sweeper at Mumbai Central station, in her complaint, said: “There was only one man in the compartment of Gujarat Express when I boarded the train at Dadar. When the train moved, he started closing all windows and doors-...Suddenly he came towards me and asked to hand over my valuables. When I refused, he snatched my bag containing her phone and Rs 4,000. I resisted, so he assaulted me and pushed me out of the train.” One of her legs was amputated below the knee and she suffered a fracture on the other leg and an arm.

Umar was detained on Wednesday when he was found loitering near the ladies coach of a long-distance train at Dadar station. “Umar was identified as his body movements matched those of the robber caught on the CCTV cameras on December 13. During interrogation, he confessed to the robbery,” said senior inspector Uttam Sonawane, railway crime branch. Umar has five similar robbery cases registered against him and was convicted in one of the cases in 2017. He was released from jail in August 2018. Umar is also the prime suspect in the November 14 incident, when a passenger, Mansi Kelkar (62), travelling in an Ahmedabad-Mumbai train was robbed of her jewellery and phone.

Indrani Mukerjea

MUMBAI: Sheena Bora murder accused Indrani Mukerjea recently moved a new bail plea after the trial court rejected her fourth application for bail on December 20.

The latest bail plea was the first in which Indrani cited “merits” of the case and said there was no evidence against her. In the four previous pleas, she had sought bail citing ill health.

Mukerjea’s handwritten 10-page plea was submitted last week and is expected to come up for hearing on Friday. Special judge J C Jagdale directed the CBI to submit its reply.

Along with former husbands, Peter Mukerjea and Sanjeev Khanna, Mukerjea is accused of conspiring and murdering her Bora (24) a daughter from a previous relationship, on April 24, 2012.

A fourth accused, Shyamvar Rai, turned approver and deposed as a prosecution witness. Mukerjea has been in jail since her arrest in 2015. So far 59 witnesses have deposed in the case.

Seeking bail, Indrani said that except for Rai’s claim and the prosecution’s allegations, there was no evidence of any content in any messages, emails or conversations or any form of communication to establish that a criminal conspiracy was hatched between the accused to abduct or kill anyone.

She claimed that false witnesses had been planted by the prosecution, details of which she said she would submit during the bail arguments. “Rai’s story does not match the Forensic-Science-Laboratory-certified call data records for the entire month of April 2012,” Indrani’s plea said.

She said different versions were given by Rai before different investigating agencies and courts of how the body was transported from Worli to Pen or how it was burnt. Mukerjea said Rai had a bout of memory loss during cross-examination by the defence. “I cannot remember, I cannot recollect was recorded over 400 times during his deposition in the court,” the plea said.

The plea also focused on the forensic evidence based on the two sets of remains recovered in the case in 2012 and 2015 respectively.

Red category units are those industries which have pollution index scores of 60 and above

HYDERABAD: Nearly seven years after a GO was issued to shift polluting industries out of Hyderabad city limits, nothing much has changed on the ground. In all, 803 red category (industries with pollution index score of 60 and above) units and 357 orange category (units with PI score of 41 to 59) industries along the ORR are yet to be shifted out.

This startling revelaton was given by the Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation Ltd ( TSIIC ) to an RTI query.

Forum for Good Governance (FGG) secretary M Padmanabha Reddy, who filed the RTI, said public health is in grave danger thanks to the polluting units not being shifted out. ""Since 2012-13, there has been very little progress. Red and orange category industries let out untreated effluents which find their way into the Musi, Hussainsagar lake and other water bodies. It involves the health of citizens of Hyderabad,"" he said.

Out of 1,545 industries identified by the Telangana State Pollution Control Board, 385 units exist outside ORR. The remaining 1,160 industries are yet to be shifted. ""The RTI reply says the feasibility study and site suitability has been given to the Environment Protection Training and Research Institute (EPTRI). Once EPTRI completes the feasibility study, shifting of industries will be taken up,"" Reddy said.

As per a GO issued by the industries department in 2013, 45 locations were identified outside ORR limits, which would be notified for industrial use in the HMDA master plan. But, this remained only on paper.

Chief engineer, TSIIC, in his RTI reply, said: ""Steps are being taken to shift edible oil industries to Buchinelly industrial market in Zaheerabad mandal of Sangareddy district and textile industries to Indrakaran industrial park of Sangareddy and steel re-rolling units to Rakamcherla industrial park of Pudur mandal in Vikarabad district for which land has already been developed.""

TSIIC also said that land required for three industrial parks had been identified for relocation and EPTRI was carrying out feasibility studies. ""The environmental assessment committee had recommended environment clearance (EC) for Hyderabad Pharma City in Rangaredy district. Once EC is obtained, we will set in motion the process of shifting pharmaceutical units,"" TSIIC said.

Then government held discussions with representatives of the industry in 2013 when it was decided to identify polluting units in ORR and shift them. The government constituted a committee with commissioner of industries as its chairman. The committee identified pharma, chemical, tannery, bleaching, dying, tobacco, foundry, rubber paints, varnish and pesticide industries to be moved. In March that year, a GO was issued to relocate the polluting industries outside the ORR limits.

Jim Masselos teaches in Sydney

Mumbai should have a museum of its own where an archive of the city comprising private papers, photographs and ephemera could be built, the noted historian of the metropolis Jim Masselos said on Thursday.

Masselos, whose work ‘Towards Nationalism,’ first published in 1974, is well-known for its discussion of the salient aspects of political and public work in western India in the nineteenth century with a focus on Mumbai and Pune, said when he arrived in the city to do research in the 1960s, his work was made easier by three places where he could make a deep dive into archival sources: the library of the University of Mumbai at its Fort campus, which had stuff going back to the early nineteenth century, the Asiatic Society and the government archives.

He said if an archivebuilding museum were set up, it could help preserve private papers — as distinct from business archives — and ephemera, which otherwise finds no place.

Speaking at a function where a book of “essays in honour of Jim Masselos” titled ‘Bombay Before Mumbai’ was discussed, with its editors Prashant Kidambi, Manjiri Kamat and Rachel Dwyer a part of the conversation, Masselos, who teaches at the University of Sydney , described the art and craft of the historian as being akin to a detective story, where “uncertainty” and “discovery” are important and may yield crucial clues.

On Mumbai losing its past, especially the remnants of its one-time working-class culture, he said, “To lose the past is, for any place, sad. No place retains all of its past, but the best must be preserved.” Mumbai varsity professor Manjiri Kamat cited the closure of Anantashram, an eatery in Khotachi Wadi, as an example of the city losing its past.

362,['3/01/2020'],Surgical strike failed to demoralise Pak terrorists: Shiv Sena,"This story is from January 3, 2020

MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena on Friday targeted the Centre by questioning the ""efficacy"" of the 2016 surgical strike and said the perception that it would demoralise Pakistani terrorists remained an ""illusion"" as Indian soldiers continue to get killed in terror attacks in Kashmir.

Accusing the Modi government of boasting about how Pakistan was straightened out after the surgical strike, the Sena sought to know whether it has really happened.

It also observed that troubled borders were not good for the country's well-being.

The Sena's remarks come in the wake of the death of an Army soldier from Maharashtra , Naik Sandip Raghunath Sawant, who was killed during a counter-insurgency operation in Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday.

""The New Year did not begin on a positive note in Kashmir. Our jawan from Satara, Sandip Sawant, attained martyrdom in Kashmir along with two other soldiers. In the last one month, seven to eight jawans from Maharashtra were killed in the line of duty. The Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra is not responsible for this,"" the Sena said in an editorial in party mouthpiece ' Saamana '.

The party also questioned whether the situation in Kashmir has improved after the surgical strike and abrogation of Article 370 provisions.

The party, however, maintained that scrapping Article 370 was a good move.

India had conducted the surgical strike on September 29, 2016, across the Line of Control (LoC) as a response to a terrorist attack on an Indian Army base in Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir earlier that month.

Without naming the Centre, the Sena alleged, ""Circulating news that only the Pakistanis were getting killed in Kashmir will not change the reality as tricolour-draped bodies of Indian soldiers, like Sawant, are reaching their respective villages.""

""There is a bloodshed along the Kashmir border and mounting anger among the families of martyred jawans. The perception that surgical strike will demoralise Pakistani terrorists has turned out to be an illusion. In fact, the (terror) attacks have increased,"" it added.

The Uddhav Thackeray-led party accused the ruling BJP of boasting about straightening out Pakistan after the surgical strike.

""But has Pakistan been really straightened out? Rather Pakistan has been indulging in ceasefire violations along the LoC every day,"" it added.

The Shiv Sena also questioned the government's claim that the situation in Kashmir was under control after the nullification of Article 370.

""It is good that Article 370 was scrapped. Before that, surgical strike was carried out in Pakistan. But has the situation in Kashmir improved? The terror attacks continue. It's only that there is a control in reporting (these incidents),"" it said.

The Sena also alleged that there was no clarity as to what was transpiring in Kashmir after the scrapping of Article 370 and only the media reports of soldiers sacrificing their lives have been coming out from that state

In a veiled attack on the BJP, its erstwhile ally, the Sena, also accused it of exploiting the surgical strike for political gains.

NEW DELHI: No one in the government has ever called the three detained former chief ministers of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir ""anti-national"", home minister Amit Shah has said, adding that a decision on their release will be taken by the administration of the union territory.

Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti had to be detained for ""some time"" after they made provocative statements, the home minister said on Thursday night while addressing an event organised by media outlet ABP News.

""Please see the statements made by them, like the entire country will be on fire if Article 370 was touched... In the backdrop of these statements, a professional decision was taken to keep them under detention for sometime,"" Shah said at the news summit.

Many political leaders in Jammu and Kashmir, including the three former chief ministers, were detained on August 5, the day the Centre announced abrogation of Article 370 provisions and bifurcation of the state into the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.

While Farooq Abdullah has been booked under the stringent Public Safety Act and confined to his Gupkar Road residence in Srinagar, which has been declared a sub-jail, his son Omar Abdullah has been detained at Hari Niwas. PDP chief Mufti was lodged at Chesmashahi hut initially but later shifted to a government accommodation.

To a question pointing out that Abdullahs' National Conference and Mufti's PDP were alliance partners of the BJP at some point of time and the leaders were now being labelled ""anti-national"", the home minister made it clear that neither he nor anyone from the government had called them so.

""As far as the decision to release them is concerned, this decision will be taken by the local administration and not me,"" he said, adding that the administration will release them whenever it deems suitable.

Shah said the situation in the Kashmir Valley was under control and day-to-day life was going on smoothly.

""Not a single inch in Kashmir is under curfew today,"" he added.

“Without considering the ground realities, the Uddhav Thackeray-led government has stayed the construction of the car shed. What is the objective behind the stay?” he asked. Somaiya alleged that the land owned by Royal Palms, as recommended by NGO Vanashakti, was being considered as an alternative. “The government will have to give the developer FSI/TDR worth Rs 4,000 crore for a disputed site,” he alleged. But D Stalin, director of Vanashakti said the site was suggested as an option.

A senior bureaucrat said the report is likely to be submitted to the government within a fortnight.

365,['3/01/2020'],40% drop in Maoist violence in 2019 in Bastar: Police,"This story is from January 3, 2020

Bastar IG P Sundarraj briefs media in Jagdalpur on Thursday.

RAIPUR: Incidents of Maoist violence have declined by 40% in the Naxal-affected areas of Chattisgarh, including Bastar, and there has been a significant dip in damages to security forces and reduction in loss of lives in the last one year, claims Chhattisgarh police.

According to police, it is because of the three-pronged strategy adopted by the government that this feat has been achieved. Inspector general of police, Bastar range, P Sundarraj, said that in 2019, government's 'Vishwas-Vikas-Suraksha' scheme was highly effective along with the contribution of state police, CRPF, STF, and other forces that led to a decline of 40% in Maoist incidents, 55% decrease in loss of security personnel and 45 per cent drop in civilian deaths in Maoist violence.

In the last one year, seven additional security camps were set up at vacuum locations in the interiors of Chindnar in Dantewada, Chikpal and Potali in Narayanpur, Pusnar and Bodli in Bijapur and Sureli in Kanker.

The top cop said in 2019, 65 bodies of Maoists were recovered during various anti-Maoist operations, including 13 Maoists who were on the level of area committee members or top cadres while 12 of them were from PLGA formation cadres.

In the encounters that took place between security forces and ultras, police recovered arms and ammunition including two SLR, five INSAS, nine .303 rifles and 128 other weapons. Sundarraj said that 475 Maoists were arrested last year, including 45 women cadres and 22 ultras of divisional committee members, area committee members etc.

Over 304 Maoists surrendered in Bastar and were rehabilitated under the state rehabilitation scheme.

IG also shared the figures of other crimes in the division, stating that Bastar has witnessed 30 per cent dip in overall crime and that police will majorly focus on women and child protection in 2020 and would also work towards bringing down the graph of fatal accidents on road.

Various departments had shifted out of Secretariat in August 2018

HYDERABAD: Wondering whether the state government, which has been claiming that its hands have become tight due to lack of funds, will now be able to take up and complete its new secretariat complex as was planned earlier, the Telangana high court on Thursday directed the state R&B department's principal secretary to inform the court the plan and design of the proposed new secretariat complex, the money required for it and the time within which it would be completed within five days

The bench of chief justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy gave this direction while hearing a batch of PILs that challenged the state cabinet's decision to demolish the current secretariat and build a new secretariat complex in its place.

The bench referred to a report published in TOI where in the state was seen asking its officials and employees to spend as less as possible in view of the tight financial position. The bench also referred to the incomplete stage of the cabinet decision taken on February 18 that proposed to eithe++r to modify the existing secretariat or to raise a new construction altogether. It also referred to the shifting of secretariat departments to various other places.

Additional advocate general J Ramachandra Rao informed the bench that the state had appointed a cabinet sub committee and an experts committee to study the issue and make suggestions. The experts committee favoured the demolition of the existing structure and build a new structure in the same place.

""We could not move forward since the high court ordered a stay on the process,"" he said. The bench reminded him that the stay was only on the demolition of the existing structure and not on the decision making process.

Upon being informed that the departments in the secretariat have already been moved out and that they have been reinstalled in various parts of the city, the bench wondered whether that would not compromise the confidentiality of certain sensitive files. The state counsel informed the bench that 70% of the departments were accommodated in the adjacent BRK Bhavan and the remaining departments, heads of departments and even the concerned ministers were accommodated in Tarnaka and few other parts of the city.

The bench reminded the state that huge structures will take decades to be completed and running the departments till then may affect file movements and that there is a danger of some of them landing in the wrong hands and some confidential files being intercepted. The case was posted to January 7 for further hearing.

BATHINDA: The special investigation team (SIT) working on the case of Malout resident and history-sheeter Manpreet Singh Manna's murder on December 2, 2019, has named four Haryana residents as the accused in the crime. Working on leads provided by gangsters Lawrence Bishnoi and Rohit Godara, Muktsar police has named Rajan of Jhanjheri village near in Kurukshetra, Kapil of Dabla village in Jhajjar , Rajesh alias Kanda of Dhani Khera village in Bhiwani and Rahul, also from Haryana, in the case.

SIT has claimed that Lawrence was the main conspirator in the killing of Manna, 37, while Rohit arranged weapons and the other four executed the killing. All four killers have cases pending against them in Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi.

Lawrence was brought on production warrants from Bharatpur jail in Rajasthan and Rohit from Churu jail, also in Rajasthan. Both will be produced in court on Friday on expiry of their police remand.

Muktsar senior superintendent of police (SSP) Raj Bachan Singh Sandhu and SIT head SP (investigations) Gurmail Singh said Lawrence had told his interrogators that he suspected Manna of providing information to police about his friend Ankit Bhadu, who was at large in some cases, which led to Bhadu's killing in an encounter at Zirakpur.

COLOMBO: Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Friday emphasised on stronger ties with all countries and outlined his government's vision as he inaugurated the fourth sessions of the Parliament, a month after he prorogued the House following his victory in the presidential elections. The parliament was to meet on December 3, but President Rajapaksa prorogued it for one month and fixed January 3 for the commencement of the next session.

He attended the parliament for the first time as he had never been a member of parliament. The president chose to be attired in European suit, a deviation from all five of his male predecessors who always wore the traditional national dress.

In his ceremonial address, the president recalled his family's long association with the assembly and explained that although he was not wearing the family trademark maroon coloured shawl with national dress which claimed to represent the peasants from the deep southern region of Giruwapattuwa, he still had their interests as a priority of his administration.

The president outlined his government's vision for efficiency, eradication of corruption and crime with accelerated infrastructure development to revive the local economy.

He told the assembly that electoral and constitutional reform would be needed to make Sri Lanka a progressive state. ""The executive presidency must be strengthened to leave no room for extremist politics"", he said.

He said that he wants stronger relations with all countries as the foreign policy of his government. ""We will not fall on our knees before any foreign nation,"" he said.

Gotabaya Rajapaksa, 70, a former military officer, was sworn in as Sri Lanka's seventh President on November 18 after he defeated the ruling party candidate Sajith Premadasa by more than 13 lakh votes, marking the return of the powerful Rajapaksa dynasty.

He named his elder brother and former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new prime minister after Ranil Wickremesinghe of the United National Party resigned from the post following the election debacle.

The 74-year-old leader will function as the prime minister of the caretaker cabinet until the general election in 2020.

Gotabaya Rajapaksa is widely expected to dissolve the current assembly by early March to set dates for a fresh parliamentary election end of April or early May.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73081315,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-155880,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/president-gotabaya-rajapaksa-inaugurates-sri-lanka-parliament/articleshow/73081186.cms

Great work by our young students. Such efforts will increase awareness on reducing single use plastic. https://t.co/poBdxPUkXI — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) 1577882476000

RAIPUR: In the town that gave India the novel concept of 'Garbage Cafe' - food in exchange of plastic waste - it's children who are powering the Swachh campaign. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday tweeted his praise for an initiative by students of a school in Ambikapur, Chhattisgarh, to curb single-use plastic.A city of less than 2 lakh, Ambikapur had jumped 15 positions in the 2018 Swachh Survey to become the second cleanest city in the country. One of the reasons for its success, evidently, is that it catches them young.Students of Holy Cross Convent Senior Secondary School collect chocolate and chips wrappers and turn them into artwork or stuff them in carboard boxes and send them back to the manufacturers along with a letter of appeal to stop using plastic.Modi lauded the kids and tweeted: ""Great work by our young students. Such efforts will increase awareness on reducing single-use plastic.""Sister Gerald, the school principal, told TOI that they have an inhouse eco-club, which takes up environment-friendly activities. ""The initiative against plastic was taken up under the same club, with teachers helping students. They have been at it for a year and never give up, no matter what the odds. They have got recognition now. The children are extremely excited after PM Modi's tweet and they are all over the news. Our students will continue the campaign.""The initiative began with students going around their neighbourhood to collect plastic wrappers and single-use items, which they turned into Christmas and New Year decorations. They also used it for classroom craftwork and creative activities. At the same time, they started sending empty packets of eatables to the companies, urging them to move to eco-friendly packaging.PM Modi's tweet sparked euphoria at the school. One of the students told local mediapersons: ""Sometimes, it was a thankless pursuit. Few people appreciated us. But we persisted. Now, Prime Minister Modi's praise has injected new energy to our campaign as the whole country knows about us.""Explaining how the thought that started the campaign, he said: ""After munching on chips, we wondered what to with the plastic. Manufacturers should either recycle plastic wrappers or not use them at all.""Ambikapur is one of the flag-bearers of the Swachh drive, modernizing garbage collection and disposal and incentivizing better disposal of garbage, especially plastic waste. It has the country's first digital garbage management system and the first to open a Garbage Cafe, where you can get a full meal in exchange of 1kg of plastic waste. This small town has a plant that turns plastic waste into granules, which are used in various construction works. A 1.5-km-long road has been made entirely of plastic granules.",raipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73081320,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-455261,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/pm-narendra-modi-praises-ambikapur-students-anti-plastic-campaign/articleshow/73081227.cms

390,['3/01/2020'],Climate change and deforestation may eliminate Madagascar's rainforest habitat: Study,"Madagascar forest cover.

NEW YORK: The combined effects of climate change and deforestation could decimate Madagascar 's eastern rainforest habitat by 2070, impacting thousands of plants, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians endemic to the island nation, according to a study.The research, published in the journal Nature Climate Change , also found that protected areas will help to mitigate this devastation while environmentalists work towards long-term solutions for ending runaway greenhouse gas emissions.Madagascar - a biodiversity hotspot where 80 to 90 per cent of animal and plant species are exclusive to the area - has been devasted by decades of deforestation and over-harvesting, according to the researchers from the City University of New York (CUNY) in the US.The activities have destroyed much of the land cover that provides habitat for a variety of unique animals, including currently endangered varieties of lemurs, they said.The researchers noted that two species of ruffed lemurs, in particular, are now critically endangered.These animals play a central role in dispersing the seeds of a number of plant species that provide food and shelter for other animals across the rainforest.""Because of their essential role as seed dispersers and their sensitivity to habitat degradation, ruffed lemurs serve as a critical indicator of the health of Madagascar's entire eastern rainforest,"" said Andrea Baden, a professor at CUNY.""When we projected the impact of deforestation and climate change, we found that deforestation alone and climate change alone could reduce ruffed lemur habitat by over 50 per cent.""Even more alarming, these two factors together are projected to essentially decimate suitable rainforest habitat by the end of the century,"" Baden said.The researchers suggest that the speed and intensity of destruction to Madagascar's eastern rainforest will be greatly determined by whether the country institutes strict protections against deforestation or a relaxed set of policies.Protecting forested areas that provide shelter to ruffed lemurs and serve as corridor links to their strongholds is particularly important to survival, the researchers said.This is due to their role as a keystone species that enables the survival of a large number of animal and plant species in one of the world's most biodiverse regions, they said.""The results from our study will be useful to nonprofit organisations, park management, and the broader conservation community,"" Baden said.""Our results indicate potential conservation opportunities for ruffed lemurs and any of the rainforest-dwellers that rely on forest cover and connectivity. Protected areas are vital to species persistence,"" he said.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73081441,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-565408,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/climate-change-and-deforestation-may-eliminate-madagascars-rainforest-habitat-study/articleshow/73081276.cms

CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu government on Thursday informed the Madras high court that Mamallapuram administration lacks funds to carry out appropriate work to maintain monuments at the heritage site.

“ASI is collecting major revenue at the rate of ₹40 per Indian tourist and ₹600 per foreign visitor and therefore, if they can do some funding to the town panchayat, they would be in a better position for undertaking such maintenance work in the tourist places of Mamallapuram,"" advocate general Vijay Narayan said.

The issue pertains to a suo motu PIL initiated by the court based on a note made by Justice N Kirubakaran to ensure proper maintenance of monuments and other places in Mamallapuram which were renovated recently for the informal Indo-China summit.

When the plea came up for hearing on Thursday before a division bench of Justice Vineet Kothari and Justice R Suresh Kumar, the DGP filed a status report informing the court that a separate wing comprising of a sub- inspector of police and four constables well versed in English has been formed and is functioning in Mamallapuram police station exclusively to deal with complaints from foreigners. In a separate counter, the district administration submitted that an average of 2,000 tourists on normal days and an average 10,000 during the weekends, and on holidays and an average of 50,000 tourists throng Mamallapuram during the special holidays and festival days. Admitting that hawkers have resurfaced in the area and on path to beach even after mass drive in coordination with revenue and police officials, the authorities said that they have strong patronage of tourists.

Recording the submissions, the bench directed the authorities to give the list of the recognized NGO’s , recognized guides working in the area besides other recognized volunteers, who can undertake peer review system for maintaining cleanliness and upkeep of the monuments and other places in Mamallapuram and posted the plea to January 21 for further hearing.

CHENNAI: The DMK on Friday continued to present complaints against state election officials for not releasing results of rural local body polls.

DMK president M K Stalin met state election commissioner R Palaniswami twice on Thursday and on Friday. DMK's parliamentary party leader TR Baalu called on chief minister Edappaddi K Palaniswami and asked him to release the results in several panchayats in Karur, Tiruvallur and Ramanathapuram districts.

“We have been asking the SEC to work without showing any support to the AIADMK but it is not happening. I don’t want to criticise the SEC but cannot remain silent,” Baalu told reporters.

Baalu said in several wards in these districts, candidates of DMK and its alliance parties have won.

“The counting in all these places was completed last night. But the officials are not ready to announce the results as the winner belongs to DMK or its alliance parties. Our party cadres are present in the counting hall since last night and in some places they are protesting,” said Baalu.

The DMK MP said the party will approach the Madras high court to issue an order asking the SEC to act.

MOHALI: Rising star of Indian cricket Shubman Gill was embroiled in a controversy when his dismissal was overturned after an argument with the on-field umpire during Punjab's Ranji Trophy encounter against Delhi on Friday, leading to stoppage of play for around 10 minutes.The current white-ball captain of the India A team refused to leave the crease after he was adjudged caught-behind by slow medium bowler Subodh Bhati. An argument with the umpire followed and the batsman was reinstated after a discussion between the on-field officials.Showing dissent to the umpire's decision is a breach of the 'Code of Conduct' and there is a possibility that match referee P Ranganathan will have a word with the player. He could either be let off with a warning or charged with a Level 1 offence.Gill was batting on 10 then. He didn't last long as he edged one off Simarjeet Singh to Anuj Rawat for 23 off 41 balls with the team's score on 60.""The straight umpire (Mohammed Rafi) had adjudged Shubman caught behind and the batsman then walked up to the umpire and was seen having an argument asking him to reverse his decision. The straight umpire then consulted the square-leg umpire (Paschim Pathak) and reversed his decision,"" Delhi team manager Vivek Khurana told PTI.Asked if there was any plan for a walk-out by the visiting side, Khurana denied any such move.""Our vice-captain (Nitish) Rana just asked the umpires as to why they overturned the initial decision. We never walked out. The match referee (Ranganathan) came in and play resumed as usual,"" Khurana added.DDCA general secretary Vinod Tihara said: ""The match was halted for seven to eight minutes. There was nothing untoward. Our boys felt that Gill was out and that's why they asked the umpires why the decision was reversed. We are not filing any official complaint as the matter is closed for us.""Senior Punjab Cricket Association official GS Walia said Gill didn't use any cuss words during his argument with the umpire.""He just told the umpire that he had not nicked the ball. All of us have seen Shubman, he is a very polite and calm boy,"" Walia said.Any decision on a sanction by the match referee will only be announced after the fourth day's play.",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73081229,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-175155,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/cricket/india-domestic/ranji-trophy/ranji-trophy-did-shubman-gill-abuse-umpire-after-being-given-out/articleshow/73081010.cms

CHENNAI: An increase in price of aviation turbine fuel (ATF) has made Chennai the second most expensive city to buy jet fuel , which can force airlines to avoid refuelling in the city airport. This will also lead to a hike in air fares.

ATF fuel prices were increased by 2.6% on January

1. This makes the one kilo litre of ATF to cost ₹65, 619 in Chennai airport while it costs ₹70,588 in Kolkata, the highest in a metro airport. Prices are lower in Mumbai and Delhi.

The price was ₹63,830 per kilo litre in Chennai as of December 1, 2018. Now, airlines will have to pay ₹1,789 more. An A320 type plane uses around six tonnes of fuel for a short domestic flight.

This is expected to encourage airlines to lift fuel from other airports and not from Chennai. The process called tankering or carrying more fuel than needed for a trip will go up, said a pilot.

""If an aircraft needs only six tonnes of fuel, the pilot will try to carry 12tonnes depending on the passenger and cargo load so that the next sector can also be flown without refueling in Chennai,"" he added.

This practice is expected to increase in the coming days as most of the domestic carriers fly multiple routes using the same plane. Since, Mumbai and Delhi is the hub for airlines to park their planes as the airports have more parking bays than in Chennai, there is a chance that pilots will carry fuel from Mumbai.

""This is likely to impact the load of the plane and quantity of cargo may have to be reduced to carry fuel. However, flights flying from Chennai to Delhi may have to carry extra fuel than they usually carry because air congestion caused by fog is leading to delays and diversions. This will be a loss,"" said an airline official.

The fuel price varies from one airport to the other because state governments charge a tax. The tax is higher in Tamil Nadu . There was a call to make prices or taxes uniform across all airports.

An official of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) said that ""The state government has reduced the tax for fuel at small airports like Coimbatore. But, in Chennai they charge high because refueling is high and there is scope for earning more money.""

Air Passengers Association of Indi national president D Sudhakara Reddy said ""Air fares are bound to go up. Already airlines are incurring loss because of the mess caused by air congestion in Delhi. The congestion is having a cascading effect of delays at all airports. This will add to it. Its surprising that they are increasing the jet fuel price though price of crude has reduced from $68 per barrel to $66.""

DHARAMSHALA: A controversy had triggered following a construction of concrete path by forest department to the land owned by family of an independent MLA from Dehra, Hoshiar Singh.

Member of Panchayat Samiti, Kharian from Dehra area, Jasbir Singh Guleria and a few other villagers that accompanied him addressed a press conference on Thursday alleged that many villages in Pong wildlife sanctuary area were without paths or roads due to strict rules but forest department showed special privilege to MLA and constructed a concrete path to his private property.

“Almost all paths in Kharian village were kucha due to restrictions of forest land. However, the forest department has chosen to concretize road that led to private land of the MLA” alleged Guleria.

He further said that the power lines passing through their village were hanging low and were threat to life. Power department did not act on this due to lack of NOC from forest department. “But the power department has given 14 electricity poles to the private land of the MLA”, he alleged.

The entire Pong Dam area falls under the Pong Dam Wild Life Sanctuary area. About 100 metre area from the edge of wildlife sanctuary was classified as eco-sensitive zone and no activity was allowed there.

They claimed that the woad which was constructed on the private property of MLA sans NOC from the forest and wildlife department.

The DFO wildlife Hamirpur, Rahul Kumar incharge of Pong Dam wildlife sanctuary area when contacted said that the wildlife department had not given any NOC for the construct of path on Kharian village area. DFO said that he would check the fact if the road constructed to private property of MLA fell in wildlife sanctuary area.

DFO Dehra, Raj Dogra said that the forest department had constructed about 150 metre road in Kharian village. But in papers this road is for cremation ground, he added.

MLA Hoshiar Singh when contacted denied allegations stating that road is already in revenue papers since 1960’s. “This road is going to benefit hundreds of family not only me” he said.

419,['3/01/2020'],"Now, devotees from India stopped from taking langar material to Darbar Sahib","This story is from January 3, 2020

Pilgrims usually carry raw vegetables and uncooked rice for langar

AMRITSAR: Following the refusal of the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) to accept donation of ‘langar’ (community kitchen) material from Indian devotees going to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan, the customs officials at Integrated Check Post, Dera Baba Nanak, have also begun advising the pilgrims to not carry any such material to the historic Sikh shrine in the neighbouring country.

“We have been told by many pilgrims upon return from Kartarpur Sahib that they were harassed by the Pakistan Rangers (Pakistan’s border guarding force) for carrying langar material,” said sources. Recently, Pakistan Rangers troops started not allowing Indian devotees to carry langar material to the gurdwara. The pilgrims were directed to leave the packets at border terminal and pick them back on their return to India.

It happened a few days after PSGPC president Satwant Singh announced to not accept any langar material from Indian devotees, saying that they had sufficient arrangements for any number of pilgrims.

A large number of Indians have been carrying potatoes, tomatoes, pulses, flour, dairy products, tea leaves and cooked chapatis among other things for the langar of Gurdwara Darbar Sahib. Following inputs from Indian pilgrims returning from Kartarpur, now customs officials too are not allowing any langar material to be carried to Pakistan via Kartarpur corridor.

Sources also said customs officials at DBN were allowing pilgrims to carry home only ‘pinni parsad’ received from Gurdwara Darbar Sahib. The PSGPC president said management of Gurdwara Darbar Sahib had sufficient langar material as well as cooks to prepare langar as per Sikh traditions.

Meanwhile, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Gobind Singh Longowal condemned Pakistan’s decision of not allowing langar material. “We will take up the issue with both Indian and Pakistan governments to lift the ban and let the pilgrims carry whatever material they wish to carry for ‘Guru ka langar’,” Longowal said.

A view of Golden Temple in Amritsar on the occasion of birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh

AMRITSAR: In violation of the Akal Takht directions, the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (PSGPC) will celebrate the birth anniversary of the 10th Sikh master Guru Gobind Singh on January 5. The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) celebrated the event, according to the approved Nanakshahi Calendar (NC), on Thursday.

""PSGPC will begin three-day celebrations to mark Guru Gobind Singh's birth anniversary from Friday at Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, Kartarpur Sahib and main function will be held on Sunday,"" PSGPC president Satwant Singh told TOI on Thursday. 'Akhand path' will begin on Friday and 'bhog' would be performed on January 5.

PSGPC follows Pal Singh Purewal-authored NC and observes all Sikh religious days accordingly. It does not abide by the calendar approved and released by the Akal Takht. Satwant said that a large number of Sikh devotees were likely to converge at Kartarpur Sahib.

Pakistan's Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) spokesperson Amir Hashmi said they had made elaborate arrangements for the stay of the Sikh devotees at Kartarpur Sahib.

On the reports of not allowing Pakistani non-Sikhs to enter the gurdwara complex, Hashmi claimed that the decision was taken owing to security constraints.

""A large number of Sikhs from outside Pakistan as well as India would be visiting. So, keeping in view their security, the government has decided to not allow Pakistani non-Sikhs to enter the gurdwara complex,"" he said.

Meanwhile, intelligence sources here feared that the Pakistan government could also impose a ban on Indian non-Sikhs going to pay obeisance via Kartarpur corridor. ""The present decision could be the foundation for the future decision of the Pakistan government to ban non-Sikhs from India to enter the gurdwara complex,"" a source claimed.

Gayatri Khandhadai, a human rights lawyer who organized a kolam protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act in Chennai, said she has become a target of the troll army on social media after Chennai city police commissioner A K Viswanathan said she had a ‘Pakistan connection’.The commissioner had said Gayatri is a researcher with Pakistan-based Bytes for All (B4A) organization and that her level of Pakistani connection and kind of connection will be inquired.Addressing a press conference organized by People’s Watch in Madurai on Thursday, Gayatri said the commissioner is responsible for her safety and security, as her privacy has been compromised by the Chennai police by making her Facebook details public. “The commissioner in a callous way published my social media credentials, essentially violating my privacy and totally compromising my security. He has sought to paint a picture whereby he has completely omitted the other organization I worked with, information on which is also present in the public domain,” she said.Bytes for All is a human rights organization based in Pakistan that focuses on information and communication technologies and digital rights. It is part of the Association of All Pakistan Citizen Journalists. She has written a research work titled ‘Desecrating Expression: An account of freedom of expression and religion in Asia’, on how one’s freedom of expression is violated on religious lines in nine countries, including Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar, she said.There is one full chapter on Pakistan, where she has written about harassment meted out to religious minorities, atheists and sexual minorities.“Chennai police have said permission for a kolam protest was denied, but the truth is that we did not seek permission at all. Police said they reached the protest site only after a resident made a complaint. The truth is there were more than 40 police personnel by the time they reached Besant Nagar, where protesters later drew kolam,” she said.“We did not draw kolam in front of the house of the man who was seen in a video released by the police,” Gayatri said. Some BJP office-bearers have targeted Gayathri by using the ‘Pakistani link’ to the anti-CAA protests.When TOI spoke to BJP spokesperson S G Suryah about her paper which detailed persecution of religious minorities in Pakistan, he agreed that this was similar to the party’s stance vis-àvis persecution of religious minorities in Pakistan. “I saw the link and checked the synopsis. If she has written about religious persecution of minorities in Pakistan, why is she opposing the CAA,” Suryah asked. The BJP’s contention was that the blog Bytes for All was filled with anti-India articles with a clear intention to spread hate against India, Suryah said. “That is why we are suspicious,” he added.Police commissioner Viswanathan told TOI that they had not been aware about her research and that the investigation against her has only started. “I never alluded to her Pakistani links.

MUMBAI: Union minister Piyush Goyal on Friday said that the percentage of minorities in Pakistan has reduced to mere three per cent from earlier 23 per cent, which is a testimony of hardships being faced by them in the neighbouring country.

Goyal attended an event in Mumbai on Friday which was organised in favor of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

""Pakistan is an Islamic country. Congress is responsible for the division of India. Thousands of people came to India and we know in what condition they came here. The trains had only dead bodies. Earlier, Pakistan had 23 percent minorities and now it has reduced to just three percent,"" said Goyal.

The Union minister further added that in India, the percentage of minorities has increased and not decreased like in Pakistan, because India has protected them and it is a secular country.

""The opposition is confused or maybe they are doing all this with proper planning. In the next 10 days, we will reach to three crore people and spread awareness about CAA,"" said Goyal.

BJP is planning a countrywide outreach program to clarify facts about the Citizenship Act and make its provisions clear among the masses.

426,['3/01/2020'],Saudi Arabia hands over Qandeel Baloch's absconding brother suspected in her murder to Pakistan,"This story is from January 3, 2020

Pakistani model Qandeel Baloch was a victim of alleged honour killing.

ISLAMABAD: Saudi Arabia has handed over social media celebrity Qandeel Baloch 's brother, an absconding suspect in her gruesome murder, to Pakistan, days after he was arrested in the Gulf kingdom, according to a media report.

Fouzia Azeem, better known as Qandeel, was strangled to death by her brother Waseem Khan at her home in Multan in the Punjab province on July 15, 2016, in a chilling murder that sent shock waves across Pakistan, triggering an outpouring of grief on social media and igniting fierce debate over the prevalence of ""honour killings"" of women.

Waseem had confessed to the murder of his 26-year-old sister and said she had brought ""disrepute"" to the ""family's honour"" with her risque videos and statements posted on social media.

The International Criminal Police Organization's (Interpol) cell in Saudi Arabia arrested Muzaffar Iqbal, brother and suspect in Qandeel's murder, on Wednesday as part of their job to tackle international crime, Pakistani media reported.

The arrest was made on the Pakistani government's 2016 request to Saudi Arabia as Iqbal was residing in the country at the time. Iqbal has been accused of aiding and abetting in Qandeel's murder, the report said.

Following Qandeel's murder, her father Muhammad Azeem Baloch had lodged a murder case against his son, accomplice Haq Nawaz and others.

An affidavit submitted by the parents in 2016 had also named two of their other sons, Aslam Shaheen and Arif.

In October last year, Arif, another absconding suspect and brother, was arrested with the help of Interpol from Saudi Arabia and transferred to Multan.

In September, a model court had sentenced Waseem to life in prison for murdering his sister after he admitted to drugging and killing his sister.

Six others, including Mufti Abdul Qavi and Qandeel's two brothers Shaheen and Arif — were acquitted in the case.

On August 22, the court had rejected the August 21 appeal of late model's parents to acquit their sons as they had forgiven them.

Prior to that, however, her parents had refused to pardon their sons and had called for capital punishment in the case.

Qandeel had become famous for her bold social media pictures, videos and comments. But those posts in which she spoke of trying to change ""the typical orthodox mindset"" of people in Pakistan were considered outrageous by the largely conservative Pakistani community.

Described as Pakistan's Kim Kardashian, Qandeel built a modelling career on the back of her social media fame. She faced frequent backlash and death threats, but continued to post her pictures and videos.

The 2016 killing sparked fierce debate in Pakistan over the prevalence of ""honour killings"" of women.

Every year over 1,000 women are murdered in Pakistan in so called 'honour killings' committed by their male relatives.

Qandeel's murder restarted the debate in the Muslim-majority country that led to the passing of an amendment to Pakistan's Penal Code in October 2016, allowing the police to take over from the victim's family as the main complainant in the case of an ""honour killing"".

The amendment made it impossible for Qandeel's family to use the country's laws that allow close relatives of murder victims to pardon the killers.

Women are moving towards financial liberation but not insurance. Here’s why term insurance is crucial for women

Disclaimer: This article has been produced on behalf of HDFC Life by Times Internet's Spotlight Team.

If you thought that retiring early is possible only if you win the lottery or inherit a windfall, Siddhant and Anjani Adkar’s story will prove you otherwise. This Bangalore-based couple laid the groundwork of an early retirement strategy in their late twenties when both of them were earning in five-figures as IT engineers. Now, at 51, and one year into their retirement, they think that it was the best decision they had ever taken. Incremental raises and an intelligent investment methodology, they say, is their recipe for success.The couple began pursuing financial independence at 29 when Siddhant expressed his desire to run a homestay post-retirement. When he sat with Anjali and analysed the methods in which they had been saving money, Siddhant realized that at the current pace, they might have to spend their whole life slogging in an office cubicle. This was the moment of revelation that made the couple introspect their financial instruments and the way they were spending and saving money. Thus, with a vision to amass enough money by their late 40s, the couple embarked on their early retirement journey. This was the time when Siddhant had just landed a job at an engineering consulting firm and Anjali was juggling her time between a job at Infosys and a part-time MTech degree. Their combined annual income along with the savings they had accumulated over the years was good, if not impressive, and they invested some of these assets in a bevy of insurance policies.However, one of the most substantial steps they took for early retirement was the adoption of the FIRE philosophy. An acronym for ‘the FIRE movement has gained immense popularity among millennials and it has been largely successful in letting people retire by their late forties or even earlier. As a textbook definition, the FIRE movement is founded on the premise that socking away 40-70% of one’s earnings for 10-15 years can accumulate a nest egg large enough to generate a passive income that’ll enable people to retire early and comfortably fund the basic living expenses.While the main engine of the FIRE approach is built on drastic lifestyle downgrades to maximize your savings rate, Siddhant and Anjali decided to take on board some of its ideas in moderation. They realised early that an aggressive plan is unsustainable in the long run and hence took up certain proponents of the philosophy like cutting down on mindless spending, intelligent budgeting, and of course investing in the right financial funds to grow their monetary portfolio. Come today, the couple runs an eco-friendly homestay on the buffer forests of Kanha National Park after having comfortably retired last year. And both Siddhant and Anjali are sure that they are financially stable and won’t have to return to the old life.So, what should be your strategy if you wish to be retirement-ready like Siddhant and Anjali Adkar? According to the couple, following these four essential rules can work wonders if early retirement is on your mind.Many people believe that early retirement is possible only for people with high-paying salaries. However unlikely it might seem, this idea is highly flawed. Financial independence for early retirement, in fact, becomes difficult for people with higher incomes as they have a spendy lifestyle. This is why one should control one’s spending to amass the nest egg required to quit the cubicle at an earlier age. The couple divides this thought in two ways. When they embarked on their retirement journey, they mapped cutting expenses and daily spending as a short-term solution, whereas increasing their income through a positive cash flow was a long term solution. They also set a believable retirement budget and ensured that it was not completely set in stone. Over the last 20 years, they revisited their investment portfolio and retirement strategy to ensure that it was up-to-date with the fluctuations in the market.A UN Population Fund report states that life expectancy at birth in India has risen from 60 years in 1994 to 69 years in 2019. In the urban areas, this rate is even higher with improved medical facilities and the access to avail them. This means that anyone planning for early retirement in India has fewer years to accumulate their nest egg and more years to spend it. This is why one of the pivotal pillars of an early retirement plan is having assets generating income that exceed your standard of living. And this is possible only with a mixed investment strategy . How, you ask.Siddhant and Anjali had a three-way approach- fixed-income investments, moderately risky investments, and diverse bucket investments. Through the use of conservative annuity plans, the couple was able to make risk-free investments where returns are always assured. But because these annuity incomes do not have fixed interest rates and don’t take inflation into account, they further invested in market-linked and fixed income options that come with part equity. Their idea behind this category of investment was because they are tax-efficient and have the potential for higher returns if the equity portion is left untouched. But it is important to ensure that these equities are bought at the right time. The third investment methodology they adopted was a three-bucket approach where the bulk amount is divided into three corpus-based on immediate use, medium-term use and long term use. While the immediate bucket, relies on liquid funds, the second and the third bucket rely on equity funds. Further implementing a FIRE methodology to this savings philosophy, they also choose to max out their returns by putting restrictions on the withdrawal amount.The couple opines that one of the foremost pillars of an early retirement strategy is inflation planning. The rising inflation shoots up expenditure in ways one cannot even imagine. In fact, financial research suggests that whatever you can purchase from the annuity of your investment strategy now can barely purchase one-third of it 25 years down the line.This is why it is important to consider inflation in your early retirement planning road map and buy financial tools that cover inflation. Taking an early retirement or financially securing your post-retirement years means investing in the right funds so that your money works for you and helps you meet your desired goals. Helping millennial couples plan towards this goal is HDFC Life Click 2 Wealth, a Unit Linked Life Insurance Plan that offers market linked returns, charges minimally and provides valuable financial protection for you and your family. Through the Golden Years Benefit Option by HDFC Life Click 2 Wealth it is aiming to provide the right blend of Retirement planning that not only builds a corpus for your golden years, but also make sure you leave a legacy behind for your loved ones. This plan option offers you the solution to build your fund value while also having life cover for your whole life (till 99 years of age).For Siddhant and Anjali, early retirement as a life goal only meant that they would retire early but work forever- on something they love. And in their case, it was a homestay. Over the years, they carefully considered the various things that they had to do to give wings to their dreams and made their financial choices accordingly. This is why they are of the opinion that an early retirement plan can never be ‘one size fits all.’ Every couple planning for the same should consider how they are envisioning their lives post-retirement- based on whether they want to work on a passion or would simply reap the benefits and lead a hustle-free life of leisure. Personally, they are of the opinion that anyone aiming to retire early should not retire on nothing but pursue a passion that they had always wanted to.Siddhant and Anjali’s journey into early retirement gives sound financial advice to a lot of people envisioning the same dream. Apart from the four major pillars through which they structured their post-retirement roof, they are of the opinion that couples today have a host of financial tools to build their nest egg- something that wasn’t there 20 years back.Most financial experts suggest that retirement planning should begin the day you start earning.

Nitish Kumar offers prayers at Patna Sahib gurdwara to mark birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh on Thursday... Read More

JALANDHAR: Birth anniversaries of founder of Sikhism Guru Nanak Dev and 10th master guru Gobind Singh would be celebrated every year at grand scale in Bihar. The state government would make all supporting arrangements for both pious occasions, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar announced on Thursday.

He made the announcement while addressing a religious function at Takht Patna Sahib to mark the 353rd birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh. Nitish said that his government would extend all support for celebrating Guru Nanak's birth anniversary at the historic gurdwara in Rajgir, which marks the memory of the Guru's visit and has already been given a major facelift in the past one year. This year, Guru Nanak's anniversary was celebrated at a grand scale for three days from December 27 to 29. Tens of thousands partook langar every day during the celebrations.

The Bihar CM, however, made an appeal to the Takht Patna Sahib management committee that if they celebrate Guru Nanak and Guru Gobind Singh's birth anniversaries at a short gap of 4-5 days every year then it will make things easier for visiting devotees.

In his address at Takht Patna Sahib, Nitish Kumar said that after the 2017 celebrations, the number of devotees visiting Takht Patna Sahib had increased manifold. While the tent city was raised for 5,000 persons, around 7,000 persons had already stayed there. While other speakers praised the Bihar CM for making flawless arrangements in 2017 as well as this year, Nitish played humble saying that his government did just its duty. SAD general secretary and former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra in his address said that Nitish had set benchmark for other state governments for making arrangements to celebrate anniversaries and other such pious occasions.

""If we compare the turn out before 2017 and now, the increase is manifold,"" said Takht Patna Sahib managing committee member Kamikkar Singh. ""This year also Bihar government made impressive and flawless arrangements. In fact, not just the Bihar government, administration and police have been very cooperative and cordial, local people have been very courteous and supportive to all the visiting devotees. The bonhomie between Sikhs and people of Bihar started in 2017, and is now going further. One can easily gauge the element of mutual respect,' said managing committee president Avtar Singh Hit.

The Takht Patna Sahib Managing Committee presented a set of sword, with gold plating, and a shield to Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, who announced that both gifts would be kept at the Bihar international museum, which is showcased the heritage of the land.

434,['3/01/2020'],Telangana says three cheers as excise revenue scales new high,"This story is from January 3, 2020

Representational Image

HYDERABAD: The Disha gangrape and murder incident in November last year triggered an outrage across the country and demands for ban on liquor kept growing louder. But, Telangana said three cheers to liquor in the very first year after it was carved out of united Andhra Pradesh in 2014.

In the financial year of 2014-15, then youngest state of India netted an excise revenue of ?10,813 crore. This was ?1,000 crore higher than what all the 23 districts in the undivided AP had earned (?9,813 crore) in 2013-14.

This was just the beginning. Four years later (2018-19), Telangana’s excise income reached a high of 65%. Compare this to the undivided AP when the growth rate in the revenue was just 26% in 2013-14. This was revealed by TPCC functionary Indira Shoban who received a reply to an RTC query she filed on the excise revenues earned by Telangana ever since it was formed as a state.

The fact that in the April 2019 parliament elections alone, liquor worth ?1,884 crore was sold in Telangana, confirming the worst fears of women activists and civic groups who believe that the increased liquor sales are leading to a spurt in attacks on women.

Though the RTI reply said there were no belt shops in Telangana, it gave a chronology of cases booked under the belt shops category. In all, 17,952 cases were booked in 22 districts. Vikarabad recorded the highest number (8,233) of cases, while Medchal stood last with least number (284) of cases. A total of 1,022 cases were booked in the backward Mahbubnagar district alone.

Also, the RTC reply revealed that the year-on-year excise growth was always more than 25%. In the first year, after Telangana came into being, liquor prices did not see any hike. But later, the prices were hiked twice.

Market analysts said the excise revenue growth this year (2019-20) in the wake of the recent hike in the prices would be known later this year. “It could be anywhere between 72-75%,” they said.

Meanwhile, Indira Shoban said liquor consumption was the main reason for growing violence on women. “In Gujarat, there is total prohibition. Prime Minister Narendra Modi should bring total prohibition in the entire country. The state government should see to it that no permission is given for liquor shops on national and state highways,” she added.

CHENNAI: Colleges across Tamil Nadu reopened on Thursday after a 10-day break in the wake of protests against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). The first day passed of peacefully, with many college managements asking their students to drop the protest and focus on studies.

The campuses had remained closed since December 21 because of the protests, though the government cited the rural local body polls and festivals as the reason. To subdue the protest, University of Madras had advanced Christmas holidays from December 18.

“The situation was volatile and the university took the right decision. After the holidays, the situation has changed,” a professor from the university said. Presidency College principal E Padmini said the college council, which met on Thursday, decided to urge students to concentrate on studies. “We are planning to invite many companies for campus placement. Our council has decided to instruct all our students to focus on studies and not get diverted by protests,” she said.

Mohamed Sathak College of Arts and Science gave a similar call its students. “By seeing other college students, our students protested only one day, that too on the campus. We have asked them to get back to books,” said a professor of the college. Some others said the decision to declare holidays has affected their academic schedule.

“We need 90 days to complete the syllabus. Due to the unexpected holidays, now we have to extend the classes till April 16 and compensate holidays by conducting classes on Saturdays,” said M G Ragunathan, principal of Guru Nanak College.

Ranjit Chautala

CHANDIGARH: Haryana power minister Ranjit Chautala on Thursday triggered a controversy while referring to measures for recovery of electricity bill arrears from defaulters in rural and urban areas of the state. Chautala had advocated that children of those defaulting electricity bill payment should be barred from appearing in the competitive examinations without the no-objection certificate (NOC) from the electricity department.

Chautala had said this during his interaction with villagers as well in a press conference organised in Sirsa district. His statement had attracted the criticism from the opposition.

Congress leader and former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda was the first to react. He said, ""How can you link electricity bill arrears with studies? Why should a student pay for parents' fault? This is something unjustified and uncalled for.""

According to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report, arrears of the distribution company (discom) Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) had touched Rs 7,332 crore. Similar is the case of another discom Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (UHBVN), which manages power network in north Haryana. Both discoms had been reeling under severe financial crisis.

The arrears are largely due to unpaid electricity bills and line losses. Government had been running various schemes from time to time to bring down the aggregate technical and commercial loses (AT&C) losses.

The officials of the electricity department refrained from commenting. But Chautala, having been trolled through the day, clarified that he did not have any immediate plans.

""What he meant to say was that just as candidates contesting the panchayat and civic body elections are required to have the NOC from discoms, there should also be such provision for the recovery of arrears from defaulters. His statement has been misrepresented. There is no such plan,"" an spokesperson of the power minister said.

Though Mohan Babu and Jayasudha tried to stop, their efforts went in vain.As soon as Rajasekhar left the stage, Chiranjeevi condemned the former’s speech and opined that a strong disciplinary action should be taken against Rajasekhar. After this high-tension drama, the Garuda Vega actor has resigned from his post of executive vice president from MAA and tendered an apology for the inconvenience caused to the guests.This latest altercation once again proved that all is not well between the senior heroes. They have always been at loggerheads with each other and here is how it all started.According to reports, the first controversy involving the duo took place way back in 2003. Rajasekhar wanted to remake the 2002 Tamil blockbuster ‘Ramana’ in Telugu and went ahead with the negotiations. However, Chiranjeevi’s team approached the producers with a fancy offer and closed the deal. Titled as Tagore in Telugu, the VV Vinayak directorial went on to become a superhit at the ticket counters. The whole scenario irked the ‘Kalki’ actor a great deal.When Chiranjeevi decided to plunge into politics in 2008, Rajasekhar stated that the former lacks political experience and so, he would not join his party. The comments triggered angry reactions from Mega fans who went berserk and attacked the car of Rajasekhar at Punjagutta. They pelted stones and attacked his car with iron rods causing minor injuries to the actor and his daughter, while his actress-wife Jeevitha was unharmed. After the unsavoury incident, Chiranjeevi drove to Rajasekhar's residence, consoled his family and in a dramatic gesture, tendered apology in the presence of the media. “We are contemporaries in the film industry. Rajasekhar has his own opinions and I respect them,” Chiru said, asking his fans to restrain themselves.However, in the following years, the Rajasekhar Jeevitha couple have made some strong allegations on Praja Rajyam Party and Chiru’s blood bank. The episode was put to rest after the ‘Sye Raa’ actor merged his party with the Congress.From the past few years, it looked like Chiranjeevi and Rajasekhar have buried the hatchet as the latter invited the former to watch his film ‘PSV Garuda Vega’ in 2017. But, with the latest altercation, things have once again turned pretty ugly.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73082005,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-488371/73082005.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/telugu/movies/news/chiranjeevi-versus-rajasekhar-how-it-all-started/articleshow/73081994.cms

Home minister Anil Vij serves food to the congregation on Thursday

AMBALA: Despite a ban on the usage of single-use hazardous plastic and thermocol plates in Ambala district, the management committee of Punjabi Gurdwara in Ambala Cantonment used thermocol plates for serving langar the devotees on Thursday. Sikhs and other devotees had converged at the gurdwara to celebrate the birth anniversary of 10th Sikh master Guru Gobind Singh .

The gurdwara management committee defied the anti-plastic and thermocol instructions of the district administration to use the hazardous material. Punjabi Gurdwara management committee president B S Bindra was contacted several times, but he did not answer calls and text messages.

Haryana cabinet minister Anil Vij also visited the gurdwara on Thursday to pay obeisance. Vij also served food to the congregation at the gurdwara. Ambala Cantonment sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Subhash Sihag was also present in the gurdwara on the occasion.

Vij could not be contacted about langar being served in single-use thermocol plates at the gurdwara despite several attempts. ""Single-use plastic is completely banned in Ambala district. We will send a team and check if the Punjabi Gurdwara management committee has defied the orders and a penalty will be imposed accordingly,"" Ambala Sadar municipal corporation executive officer Vinod Nehra said.

Ambala Cantonment SDM Sihag said, ""During the visit it was noticed that thermocol plates were used in the community kitchen and instructions were issued to the gurdwara management committee to not to use those in future. They have assured that they will take care in future. It was a religious event, therefore, it was not appropriate to obstruct the ongoing event.""

TTD head priest AV Ramana Deekshitulu

TIRUPATI: The schism among priests at Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams came out in open when honorary chief priest AV Ramana Deekshitulu and chief priest A Venugopala Deekshitulu disagreed over temple rituals on December 31. A group of priests led by Venugopala said Ramana tried to deviate from the norms by trying to use tulasi malas and other flowers brought from his home.

Ramana said as a honorary priest he had the right to adorn garlands to the presiding deity inside the sanctum sanctorum. According to sources, Ramana, who was reinstated as honorary chief priest on December 28, reached the sanctum sanctorum on December 31 after Koil Alwar Tirumanjanam and tried to pour ghee into a set of ghee-lit lamps and adorn tulasi garlands as well as other flowers brought from his home.

But Venugopala pointed out to Ramana, who is his paternal uncle and the honorary chief priest, that it was not proper to bring articles from his home to be used at the temple. He told Ramana that pouring ghee into lamps was the job entrusted to the Jeeyar mutt and that the chief priest and other priests had completed the Alankara procedures.

Ramana said he was pouring ghee into the lamps for the well being of Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy and the well being of the state. Ramana said he had the right to adorn flowers to the deity and pour ghee into the lamps as a honorary chief priest. Senior officials at TTD tried to pacify the priests.

Former TTD trust board member and TDP functionary AV Ramana accused the state government for the division among the priests. ''The government is using Ramana as a pawn to defame the temple. The government should answer how it will safeguard the sanctity of the temple when priests quarrel in front of devotees'', he questioned.

Former TTD trust board member and BJP functionary G Bhanuprakash Reddy said Ramana was functioning in a unilateral manner by deviating from the guidelines. ''Why did TTD bring Ramana back despite him leveling false accusations against the temple administration in the past,'' he asked.

On Thursday morning, there were some reports that the protesters had decided to call off their agitation.

NEW DELHI: Amid reports that the 18-day-long protest at Shaheen Bagh against the Citizenship Amendment Act had been called off, the organisers on Thursday said that the agitation would continue.

In the morning, there were reports that the protesters had decided to call off their agitation as ""it had been hijacked by politicians"". But as the day wore on, it became clear that the protesters, mostly women, were going nowhere.

It was Sharjeel Imam, one of the organisers, who posted on the social media that the protest had been called off. ""The protest is being ended to avoid the impending violence from party goons and avoid politicisation of the stage by parties. Police were probably asked not to intervene because BJP intends to intervene themselves. If that happens, our peaceful protest will be tarnished and it will break the morale of the people (sic),"" Imam wrote. Later, speaking to TOI , Imam confirmed: ""With consensus, we decided to call off the protest.""

Immediately after the post, several voices emerged that the protest would continue.

It was later revealed that Brahm Singh, a BJP functionary, had written a letter to Delhi Police that the protesters be removed in 48 hours to end the resultant traffic congestion and problems to citizens. Singh, a resident of Sarita Vihar, told TOI: ""We also protested on Thursday (against the jams). We wanted to march to DCP office, but were stopped midway and they (police) took our memorandum. They promised us action.""

Protesters called this a veiled threat. ""The letter demands violent police intervention and promises politically motivated disruption of a peaceful citizens' protest, mainly led by women residents,"" said one of them.

Police confirmed that they had received the letter and also that one of the protesting groups had informed them about calling of the agitation. ""We are in talks with the protesting groups to shift the agitation elsewhere. However, there has been no breakthrough so far,"" a senior police officer sa id.

Meanwhile. a march will be held from Jamia Millia Islamia to Shaheen Bagh on Friday.

Representative image

By: Amit Kumar

KARNAL: The sub-divisional civil hospital in Assandh town of the district is facing a shortage of doctors, staff and infrastructure. It has just three doctors out of a sanctioned strength of 11 medical officers (MO). Posts of several paramedical staff and Class IV employees are also yet to be filled due to which the hospital is unable to deliver to the satisfaction of a large number of patients in the region.

The 50-bed hospital has been reduced to a referral hospital with matters related to emergency care. Due to the shortage to doctors, there is no health service at night. The authorities prefer to refer critical patients and accident victims to Kalpana Chawla Medical College and Hospital in Karnal .

The ultrasound facility also is not available here, forcing the patients, mostly pregnant women, to go to private centres. The hospital also does not have any obstetrician, despite about 100 deliveries reported every month. Reportedly, staff nurses handle delivery cases in the hospital.

The sub-divisional civil hospital sees around 1,000 outpatient department visits on a daily basis, but the shortage of doctors has crippled healthcare services and most of the patients end up going to private hospitals. Against sanctioned post of two, the hospital has only one senior medical officer (SMO), while of 11 sanctioned posts of medical officer (MO), only three are filled. Two posts of staff nurses are vacant, out of 12 sectioned .

Not having to mouth such intense dialogue with that kind of language like we did on three films. It was refreshing. In fact, we had to remind ourselves that 'this is the same actor that I've worked with'.""The characters are completely different, the era is completely different.

According to a recent study, overweight men or those with higher BMI have more sex than those who are on the lighter side of the weighing scale.Scientists and researchers from the Anglia Ruskin University in the UK arrived at this interesting conclusion—that fat men have more sex than thin men—after analysing almost 5,000 sexually active British people. The study was published in the journal PLOS One. Surprisingly, men with more flabs had lesser body image issues than thin men and that gave them the confidence to have sex, stated the report. The researchers also found that overweight women were also 16 per cent more likely to have more sex than their thinner counterpart.The researchers, who carried out the study which is believed to be the first to draw a link between the weight of a person and his frequency of intercourse, also made this observation that overweight people are more likely to be in a happier and satisfying relationship. “I believe the observed association is owing to spouses in satisfying relationships relaxing their efforts to maintain their weight because they are no longer motivated to attract a mate. Therefore, those who are overweight are more likely to be in a happy and satisfying relationship and…more likely to engage in frequent sexual activity,” lead researcher Dr Lee Smith told the journal PLOS One.This news might come as a relief to a lot of people who are struggling to lose weight, however, they should take this with a pinch of salt. According to other studies, overweight people or people with higher BMI suffers from sexual problems. According to a report published in WebMD, “Up to 30% of obese people seeking help controlling their weight indicate problems with sex drive, desire, performance, or all three. Often, the latest research shows, these problems can be traced to physical conditions that co-exist with obesity.”What people should aim for is to have the perfect BMI rather than trying to lose weight unnecessarily just to look good and magazine-cover-worthy.

system has led to increasing air misses over Chennai. Overhaul is the only solution

low recruitment and training

4 Confusing airspace

Chennai airport will be ready to handle more flights by the end of 2020 as new terminal, rapid exit taxiways and a parallel taxiway for the main runway, all built at a cost of a little more than ₹2,000 crore, will become operational. But the development of air traffic control infrastructure is not in sync with the development of amenities for passengers and the number of new flights and frequency additions allowed. The last attempt to improve air traffic control (ATC) was done almost a decade ago when automation was commissioned in 2011. Grappling with slow machines, controllers have been making mistakes that caused a spike in air misses in 2018 in Chennai airspace. There were 13 such incidents in 2018.AAI took temporary measures such as training and corrections in procedures to bring it down to nine in 2019. But controllers say unless systems are changed or upgraded, safety is at risk. The Air Traffic Controllers Guild had sounded a warning after controllers struggled with slow machines in Mumbai to handle the spurt in overflying flights in 2019 when Pakistan closed its airspace.Here’s what ails our airport:With major intercontinental air routes passing over the city, the air traffic controllers who sit in Chennai airport manage more than 2,000 planes in areas spread over the southern peninsula. However, the attempts to modernise the control systems have slowed down since 2011. “Air traffic control automation was the last improvement that was done in Chennai. It’s like using 2011 laptops in 2020 with only software updates. Controllers battle slow machines that affect accuracy of signals about location of planes and their speed,” said an Airports Authority of India (AAI) official.Sources say the government process is so slow that annual maintenance contracts for most of the machines are given almost after their shelf life is over. “Machines with high configuration are needed. Air traffic control has moved to artificial intelligence in Euro Control. They keep updating the hardware and software every couple of years,” an official said. There were two attempts to use satellite tech to guide planes to take off and land at airports. A pilot project was done using flights. But it has not taken off after the ground equipment got destroyed in the 2015 floods.ATC teams have been split into those controlling flights in the upper air, those handling flights in different sectors like teams for planes flying over the Bay of Bengal and those that handle low-flying planes at different airports. But potential for human error continues to be high because many procedures are still manual.AAI has an archaic rule that surveillance radars can only be installed at airports that handle at least 30 flights a day. With the ministry of civil aviation pushing for regional connectivity, the number of flights in the southern airspace has increased. This, coupled with the presence of small airports in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and restricted airspace controlled by air force, makes better surveillance crucial to minimise mistakes.Airports such as Madurai and Trichy need surveillance radar that can monitor flights at 200 nautical miles. In its absence, controllers often struggle with blind spots near Madurai on the Chennai-Thiruvananthapuram route. Small airports such as Tuticorin see around 16 flights a day. Salem airport has started to receive flights. This means, there are too many planes, especially lowflying ones. “These planes while descending and ascending often come in the way of other flights. It causes delay and flights waste fuel. The controller who monitors the airspace from Chennai needs to keep a watch over too many intersections. This increases the load,” said an official.The need is for new radars at more airports, improvement of existing equipment. Sources say that updating and adding new radar will not cost as much as building a terminalt.Air traffic controllers are crucial to air safety, but their recruitment and training has been slow. The number of flights has been increasing steadily but AAI has not ensured adequate controllers at airports.It takes at least a year to train and deploy fresh controllers. As recruitment is often stuck in government delays, the available people are deployed and used in an irrational manner. Chennai has around 250 air traffic controllers while the requirement is 350 as DGCA is looking at implementing duty time controllers soon.“Several controllers are deployed at small stations with not much work. As the choice of controllers is limited, senior controllers are deployed to handle planes instead of using them to train and monitor as is done abroad,” said an official. The average age of controllers is around 50 and it’s a job that requires good reflexes. Poor reflexes will have an impact,” he said. This was evident in the unusually high number of air-miss incidents in 2018. There was almost a near-miss every other day in some of the months. “New flights are being allowed without checking whether traffic control can handle them. This is forcing inexperienced people to handle planes and move up to senior posts leading to errors,” said former pilot and air safety expert Mohan Ranganathan.Airspace is not designed well for pilots to plan flights in an efficient and fuel-saving manner. Old routes based on conventional navigation aids and new ones based on RNAV (area navigation), which allow pilots to take the shortest route, coexist. The path followed by planes to land and the ones used by overflying often intersect causing confusion among controllers. A small mistake by pilots leads to a near air-miss. The flexi-use airspace by merging defence airspace and civil airspace is yet to be implemented smoothly.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73082178,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-406774,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-outdated-tech-staff-crunch-put-flights-over-city-at-risk/articleshow/73082148.cms

CHANDIGARH: Ten years ago, Maninder Singh - the suspect in the murder of 29-year-old nurse Sarabjit Kaur - had allegedly killed his first girlfriend on finding the number of another man in her cellphone.

During investigation into the nurse murder case, police found that in 2010, Maninder had stabbed to death his girlfriend, who lived as a tenant at his house in Sector 30. The victim had gone to Karnal for a month-long training in 2010 and Maninder used to call her on her cellphone. On finding her phone busy on several occasions, he started suspecting that she was having an affair with another man. One day, Maninder checked her phone and found the number of a man. On this, he went to meet her at a park near Karna lake and allegedly stabbed her to death. Karnal police had registered a murder case and arrested him. He was convicted by a court and sentenced to life imprisonment. Maninder challenged the verdict in the Punjab and Haryana high court. After he had spent around five years in jail, the HC granted him bail and the case is pending.

Sector 31 police said cellphone of Sarabjit was also missing and switched off since her murder. Cops suspect Maninder fled with her phone after killing her. Police said the accused had switched off his phone, too, and his last location was Industrial Area, Phase II. Cops said he locked the door from outside and took away the key after murdering Sarabjit in room number 301 of Hotel Sky in Industrial Area, Phase II. Hotel staff had opened the room with a master key on not getting any response from inside on January 1.

Police said family members of the suspect were also interrogated, but they said they had not seen him since December 30 and submitted a missing complaint at Industrial Area, Phase-I, police station. Police, on Thursday, handed over Sarabjit's body to her family after post-mortem. They have returned to Sangrur to perform her cremation.

Smoke billows from a battery factory where firefighters were dousing fire at Peeragarhi on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Mahavir, one of the firefighters who was rescued from under the debris, is nicknamed “Daredevil” as he had a miraculous escape in a similar way during the Nai Sadak fire in 2010. He was buried under a pile of debris and had to be pulled out to safety. His colleagues said he is one of the first responders to any major fire in the city.

Firemen Manjeet Rana and Mahavir were rescued within the first hour of the fire breaking out. Mahavir suffered severe injuries on his leg, hip and ankle.

Vijay Dahiya, who was also trapped in the debris, had a lucky escape suffering only minor injuries. He recalled that while they were spraying water on the blaze in the early hours, there was a sudden explosion that literally made the ground sink under their feet. Because of this, the men standing on the boundary wall were sucked into the debris. Dahiya jumped in to save his fellow firemen, but got injured when a second portion of the building collapsed.

Most of the firemen escaped with minor injuries as they fell between concrete slabs because of which they were shielded from the falling debris.

“Baal baal bach gaya (I escaped by a hair’s breadth),” these were the words uttered by Dahiya after he was discharged from hospital later in the day.

Inducted in Delhi Fire Service in 2009, Dahiya was posted at the Rohini fire station. He sustained injuries on his shoulder and knee while trying to rescue Rana, who is currently admitted in the ICU with a leg and pelvic fracture and breathing difficulty.

“We received a call about the fire around 7.40am. First, we rescued Vijender Kashyap, a worker at the factory. When we started moving the tin, cardboard packing boxes and slabs, a part of the building near the lift collapsed and the debris landed on us,” said Dahiya.

Fireman Dalbir, who had a close shave from falling debris and suffered injuries on his shoulder, said that the basement had turned into a pool of fire. Because of this, the structure started swaying before it collapsed.

“I could hear my colleagues calling out our names, but we couldn’t respond because of the toxic smoke and smell. It was only after they spotted one of our hands that rescue operations began. There was no space between the collapsed portion of the building and the adjacent wall,” Dalbir said.

JAIPUR: Rajasthan ’s social justice and empowerment minister Bhanwar Lal Meghwal on Thursday expressed concern over rapid population growth in the country and stressed on the need for bringing a law on population control saying, “The new slogan of the government should be 'hum do, humare ek' (one family, one child) instead of 'hum do, humare do' (one family, two children).”

Earlier, on December 31, three ministers of the Gehlot government, including health minister Raghu Sharma, transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas and minister of state (MoS), information and public relation, Subhash Garg, had collectively advocated that a law on population control was the need of the hour. They also stressed on the need for giving birth to ""one child, instead of two"".

Meghwal said this while addressing the reporters on Thursday after the 'Jan Sunvai' held at Pradesh Congress office here. ""I believe that the government of India should bring a law on population control mandating that parents should not give birth to more than one child, be it a girl or a boy.

There should not be any discrimination between a boy and a girl. Therefore, instead of ""Hum do, humare do"", the slogan should be slogan should be ""Hum do, humare ek"". China is the only state which has been able to take tough steps in controlling rapid population growth in their country."" ""Poor people were so terrified because of the errors committed by the officials in implementing Sanjay Gandhi 's idea of sterilization for population control that it led to the defeat of our government in the 1977 general elections. But no law should be brought to intimidate the people of the country,"" he added. He added, both ministers and secretaries incharge of districts must visit districts together.
