Picture this: You suddenly meet someone on the road, who murmurs poetry in your ears. Curious as it may sound, Les Souffleurs — Commandos Poétiques (the whisperers) are coming to Bengaluru for the first time with their poetic secrets and surprise interventions. Nine artistes from the French collective are currently touring four cities in India with their unique project, called Jaan.So, what do they whisper? They will slowly recite select verses of poetry by Indian poets. Interestingly, the group comprises comedians, writers, dancers, theatrepersons and musicians. They usually pop up in public spaces and act through poetry and quiet choreographies. In India, they are enacting in four languages — English, Hindi, Urdu and Bengali. The artistes have previously performed in Spanish, Italian, Arabic, Hebrew, Portuguese, Turkish, Romanian and Japanese. The Bengaluru chapter is presented by Chennai-based arts collective, Prakriti Foundation, in collaboration with the Institut français India.Describing it as a flash mob of poetry, Meera Krishnan, of Prakriti, says, “It is a unique project that intends to make poetry more accessible in public places. This is mainly for common citizens who either do not have access to a library or are too confined in their day-to-day activities and can barely manage time to pick up a book to read.” The whisperers mainly perform via gestures, installations and writings. The artistes murmur poetic, philosophical and literary secrets in the passers-by’s ears with the intention “to create slowdowns into the beating heart of cities, restore the meaning behind each poetry verse and adopt a tender, benevolent and furtive gesture in common public spaces”.“People tend to find opening poetry books much more difficult compared to novels or political texts. This allows the audience to discover a therapeutic literature through poetry. They can expect curiosity, discovery and lots of love. We whisper beyond castes and distinctions,” say the artistes, adding, “Through our silence and slow pace, along with the tumult of contemporary Indian society, we try to create a poetic counterpoint — the blaring horns vs the whispers. And somewhere the point between these horns and our whispers is where we find harmony, jaan.”In Bengaluru, they will perform at Cubbon Park, alternative art hubs, as well as co-working spaces from February 2 to 4.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73767580,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-195181/73767580.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/french-troupe-of-poetry-whisperers-comes-to-bengaluru/articleshow/73767632.cms

Karavali thrives in celebrating its unique culture and traditions, and Kambala holds a prime spot in this scheme of things. One such race was recently held on the outskirts of Mangaluru . The annual Rama Laxmana Jodukere Kambala is usually held at night, and it goes on till the wee hours of the following day. The race is divided in six categories – Naegilu Hiriya, Naegilu Kiriya, Hagga Hiriya, Hagga Kiriya, Kane Halage and Adda Halage.

Onlookers cheered and rooted for their favourites. The highlight of the event, though, were the tassels representing the tricolour that graced the horns of the participating bulls.

Joining the list is Nagso Challenge, a show hosted by Taneesha, which will have Kirik Keerthi Sparsha Rekha and Pawan Kumar as judges.Speaking about the show, director Bhuvan Shastry says, “Nagso Challenge is not only limited to standup comedy, skits, mimicry or mono acting, which are currently seen on television. Contestants can do whatever act they want, according to their creatviity, but they have to do it in four minutes, without resorting to double entendre. The idea is to present comedy in its purest form, so that people of all age groups can enjoy it. In total, we have selected 26 contestants between the age groups of nine to 60 years across Karnataka, who will progress to the next round based on the judges’ opinion.”As for having Keerthi, Rekha and Pawan as judges, Bhuvan adds, “Pawan is known for his comedy in Kannada movies, while Rekha has carved a niche for herself as a versatile actor. She can guide talented contestants in the right way. Keerthi is a creative guy known for his spontaneous humour, so we zeroed on him,” he says.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73771788,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-111292/73771788.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/kannada/kirik-keerthi-sparsha-rekha-and-pawan-kumar-to-judge-new-kannada-comedy-show/articleshow/73771788.cms
3,['31/01/2020'],Flashback: Meet television’s original Ram and Sita,"“If life gives you many things at one point, there is always a balance that it strikes at another point. You have to take life as it comes,” says actor Arun Govil , who is best known as television’s original Lord Ram. It’s been three decades since Ramanand Sagar’s 'Ramayan' aired, and the last few years have seen many versions of the epic on the small screen, but even today, his level of popularity remains unmatched. However, as Govil admits, along with the highs, he has also experienced lows. In an exclusive chat with BT, the actor opens up about how he could never return to the world of films and TV after playing Lord Ram , the lure of politics and why he prefers to keep away from showbiz now. Excerpts:The fact that someone is asking me about my role 31 years after the show ended, proves that people still consider me the best version of Ram on screen. (Writer-director Ramanand) Sagar sir’s 'Ramayan' had an impressive cast, the script was outstanding, the performances were good and above all, his belief in 'Ramayan' made all the difference. After our show ended, many others, including Sagar sir’s sons, made shows on the epic. However, I felt that their casting was not as good. I could be termed old-school, but I believe that the content of a mythological or historical show should not be tampered with. Technologically, we are more advanced today, but our show was supreme in terms of content.That’s true. I had started my career as a Hindi film hero and post Ramayan, when I wanted to return to Bollywood, the producers said, ‘Your image as Ram is so strong, we cannot cast you as anyone else or give you a supporting role.’ They felt that I was not suited for commercial movies anymore. That became the biggest minus point of my career, and I realised that I could never return to showbiz the way I wanted to. I took up a few TV shows, but every time I did something, people rejected me saying, ‘Arre, Ramji kya kar rahe hain’. I was disappointed and there was a question mark on my career. On one hand, a single show had earned me immense love and admiration, but on the other, my career came to a standstill. I worked for a few more years before putting a full stop to my career in showbiz. For the last 14 years, I have not done anything, except maybe make a few special appearances. I have not given up on acting completely, but I will do something only if it is good.I turned towards my guru, who evoked my interest in spirituality and the study of mantras. It’s not that I have turned cynical because I got a raw deal. One has to take life as it comes. If life gives you many things at one point, there is always a balance that it strikes at another point. I am not jobless now; it’s just that it was not important to continue acting. There has never been a situation where I had to worry about running the family. I have always had the faith that I can support myself. I remember, after the audition for 'Ramayan', I had requested Sagar sir for Ram’s role, but they had already chosen someone else. They asked me if I was ready to play Lakshman or Bharat, but I declined. Then suddenly, one day, they told me that I was playing Ram. If you are sure about yourself and what you want, you will succeed.I have been receiving offers to join politics since 1988. In the last elections, too, I received a tempting offer. Anybody who aspired for a career in politics would have grabbed it. I was also a bit inclined towards it, but somehow, it did not materialise. Also, I am too straightforward for politics. If I don’t like something, I will say it openly and that does not work in politics. I realised that I would not be able to sustain a political career and so, I opted out. Many people advised me to capitalise on my image as Ram and join politics, but that’s not me. I don’t believe in trading. I also believe that there is no limit to what people want in life. Even if I accepted the offer, then what? I would have wanted to move on to something else and the cycle would continue. I have reached this point after understanding the importance of life. The lesser I get involved, the lesser the stress and complications.I don’t socialise much. I can sit idle and alone for four-five hours, and still enjoy it. I watch films and read fiction and non-fiction books. In fact, I have started reading Hindi literature again. People still fall at my feet and it is very embarrassing when they have tears in their eyes on seeing me.I don’t understand the content on TV now, though technically, they have grown by leaps and bounds. The actors are good and hard-working, but there is no story or logic in the shows. People ask why TV shows are dragging, it is because viewers continue to watch them. We need finite shows. I was offered many roles to play the father, but they were not meaningful at all.It is not necessary that two co-actors have to be friends. Dipika and I would talk only about work and that was fine.She was literally worshipped across the country when she played Sita in 'Ramayan'. And then, she entered politics as a Member of Parliament (from 1991 to 1996). Dipika Chikhlia Topiwala says that she had received “everything on a platter”. But post her marriage to industrialist Hemant Topiwala, she preferred to focus on her personal life and disappeared from the limelight. Now, as she gears up for her second innings in showbiz, Dipika talks to BT about how the image of Sita worked against her, why she quit politics and her future plans. Excerpts...There were pros and cons of portraying Sita. I became a household name, but the image of Sita went against me because after that, I was offered similar roles on TV. I wasn’t glamourous like Zeenat Aman or Hema Malini, and maybe that’s why I was not approached for big roles in films. After a long time, I took up a role in a historical show because it gave me a chance to do something different. I also moved to regional cinema, but it wasn’t easy, as I could not speak South Indian languages. After a point, I gave up.I can easily say that I am destiny’s child. Fame, TV shows and even a career in politics came on a platter, but the day I got married, my dreams changed and my other ambitions took a backseat. I wanted to be a hands-on mom. Being a politician would not have allowed me to be at home when my daughters needed me. I was also working with my husband at that time and he suggested that I stick to one thing. So, after I finished my term in the Parliament, I gave up my seat. I did win the election, but I had developed cold feet and got nervous about becoming a politician. However, exiting politics did not bother me as much as lack of quality roles did. Also, the urge to be at home and play the role of a wife and mother was so strong that I felt it was best to give it all up.When we did a show in those days, we never took up any other work. So, it never clashed with my image and that’s why perhaps, our roles are still remembered. The actresses are good now, but they look like heroines and not the characters that they are playing. The glamour element is stronger than looking the part. In those days, I refrained from even wearing nail polish and lipstick and I used to chop my nails whenever I was on set. I remember Hema Maliniji calling the Sagars and telling them to ask me not to wear any lipstick, as that would make my character look more real. I don’t enjoy watching TV shows now and my attention span is less. I may watch a crime-based show, but nothing really holds my attention for long.My children are grown up now and though I don’t mind playing mother on TV, I should not just be a part of the décor in the show. The supernatural genre is dominant right now and people are watching those shows, so there is no way you can stop making them, but I will never become a naagin (laughs!). Having said I would love to do a costume drama like a mythological or historical show, and also, films.I met Arun (Govil) after 25 years at a function, and we were cordial. Sunil (Lahiri, who played Lakshman) has kept in touch and I also speak to Arvind (Trivedi, who played Ravan) sometimes. I am focussing on getting back to acting full-time since I am free now. I also enjoy doing my yoga, meditation and my regular chores.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73768948,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-122759/73768948.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/flashback-meet-televisions-original-ram-and-sita/articleshow/73768021.cms

7,['31/01/2020'],Planning to go vegan? Make sure your body gets these essential nutrients,"Although still relatively new, veganism is fast becoming a popular dietary practice. With stores selling a variety of organic products and supermarkets offering plant-based mock meat and milk, as well as other healthy substitutes, options seem to be plenty for those who follow this ‘ethical’ trend. However, many would also agree that maintaining a vegan diet is quite challenging. People often find themselves at crossroads during the transition to opting for a wholesome vegan meal plan. Here are a few things to keep in mind before taking the plunge…“Don’t switch to veganism just because your favourite celebs are following this diet. While veganism is a healthy dietary practice, it is important to understand its ethos before opting for it,” says Kavita Devgan, a Delhi-based nutritionist, adding, “Figure out whether or not it will agree with your body. You should also be willing to spend the required time, effort, energy and money to ensure that you are maintaining the protein and nutrient levels in your vegan diet.”Once you have turned vegan, it is important to plan your diet carefully. If you relied on dairy products for calcium, you can now choose from alternatives such as ragi, soybeans, leafy greens, sesame seeds and almonds, says Sheela Krishnaswamy, a dietician and wellness consultant. “Proteins help repair your body’s tissues, muscles, hormones and enzymes. In a vegan diet, toor dal, moong, chia seeds and almonds can provide adequate amount of protein for your body. Almonds also make a great snack option, particularly when you have those between-meal hunger pangs,” she suggests, adding, “It is about ensuring that all your dietary requirements are met adequately.”“Vitamin B12 is the only nutrient that is not found in plant foods. Its deficiency in the body may cause anaemia or even lead to neurological problems. So, if you decide to turn vegan, get your Vitamin B12 levels assessed regularly and take B12 supplements, if required,” says Sheela. It is advisable to evaluate your goals before taking the plunge. Many also partially follow the diet before turning full-time vegan. “Going vegan suddenly may take a toll on your body. So, start your transition by being a part-time vegan. It’s better to take help from health experts to understand the diet better,” she suggests.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73770779,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1288910/73770779.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/diet/planning-to-go-vegan-make-sure-your-body-gets-these-essential-nutrients/articleshow/73770779.cms

The artistes murmur poetic, philosophical and literary secrets in the passers-by’s ears with the intention “to create slowdowns into the beating heart of cities, restore the meaning behind each poetry verse and adopt a tender, benevolent and furtive gesture in common public spaces”.“People tend to find opening poetry books much more difficult compared to novels or political texts. This allows the audience to discover a therapeutic literature through poetry. They can expect curiosity, discovery and lots of love. We whisper beyond castes and distinctions,” say the artistes, adding, “Through our silence and slow pace, along with the tumult of contemporary Indian society, we try to create a poetic counterpoint — the blaring horns vs the whispers. And somewhere the point between these horns and our whispers is where we find harmony,.”In Bengaluru, they will perform at Cubbon Park , alternative art hubs, as well as co-working spaces from February 2 to 4.In Video: France's poetry whisperers come to Bengaluru",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73767580,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-195181,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/french-troupe-of-poetry-whisperers-comes-to-bengaluru/articleshow/73767325.cms
10,['31/01/2020'],Raai Laxmi’s film will have an animated tiger for 40 minutes,"Cinematographer MV Panneerselvam’s debut film as a script writer, Mirugaa , which stars Raai Laxmi and Srikanth, is in its final stages. He had told us earlier that a tiger will be seen in a crucial role in the film, which is directed by J Parthiban.Now, the team has created an animated tiger which will be seen in the film for almost 40 minutes. “Usually, in our films, the portions that actually have visual effects will be for say, about five to 10 minutes. But in our film, the tiger’s footage lasts approximately 40 minutes,” says Panneerselvam, who has also shot Mirugaa.The team took several references and made dummies of the tiger, which formed the blueprint for the animated version. “Many filmmakers go to Thailand to shoot with tigers for real, or use rubber or thermocol dummies when shooting scenes with tigers, but we did not resort to any such acts. We have created the tiger in our film entirely digitally. I wanted to do this with an animation studio here rather than go abroad or Mumbai for the visual effects work,” he states.The studio that he went with was behind the recent film, Thumbaa, which also had a tiger in the central role. Quiz him as to whether the footage created for that film has also been used here, and he says, “You cannot use VFX that was done for a different film because in every shot the lighting will be different, especially when the animated tiger is a character. Work on the visual effects in this film has been going on since March 2019.” He informs that the animal will appear in three sequences in the film — in the opening sequence, the interval portion and the 40-minute climax. “The climax will have very little dialogues and will feature just four characters — the hero, the heroine, a child, and the tiger,” he says.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73768428,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-805277/73768428.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/raai-laxmis-film-will-have-an-animated-tiger-for-40-minutes/articleshow/73768428.cms

Though he didn’t win the Bigg Boss Tamil 3 title, Kavin managed to win the hearts of many. The audience despised him initially, but started liking him slowly, and by the end of the show, they were, in fact, rooting for him. With a massive fan following, no wonder Kavin has been chosen as the Chennai Times Most Desirable Man On Television 2019 . When we informed him of his win, he asked us whether we were playing a prank on him. “Ennoda collar-ah thooki vittutu, naan veetla Chennai Times paper-oda nadakka poren,” he laughed. In his first interview after the reality show, Kavin tells us his experience on the show, his concept of love, and more…I have been keeping a track of the desirable coverage for the last couple of years. Last year, my friend Vijay had won and I’d wished him, too. In the main list, namma thala Anirudh had won. This time, I am surprised to see my name on the list. It makes me happy that I am part of something that boasts big names. See, when you are in the media, you would always want to be a part of such lists or award nominations, right? In that sense, I felt like I made it. But when you told me that I’ve been chosen as the Most Desirable Man on Television 2019, I honestly thought you were playing a prank. But I am glad that I’ve been chosen for the top slot. This is more like a reminder to push myself more and work hard consistently... to be responsible and sincere with my work.The idea of being desirable changes from person to person. If you’ve seen me in the show, I mostly stuck to wearing shorts and veshti. I think people could relate to me. But I should say that I felt intimidated doing this shoot (laughs). I don’t wear a suit even for a friend’s marriage. Namakku veshti dhaan… I am a quintessential Tamil paiyyan.I think so. They like my humour and I guess they admire my boy-next-door appeal. Naan paaka yaaro anniyama theriyala. I’ve become active on social media only now, but most of the comments I get for the posts are heartwarming. They call me anna or thambi. They don’t see me as an artiste.Who doesn’t enjoy such attention? We are in the acting business and it only warms your heart when you have a huge fan following. I do get a lot of comments from women for my social media posts. When I am out, some of them take pictures and selfies with me. It’s nice.Well, yes. To be a part of the show was an experience of a lifetime.You get to meet 15 or 16 people and lead your life without phone or books. Even if you plan this, it won’t happen. As humans, you usually live within a boundary… a comfort zone. I wanted to break that shell and see what happens. Though I was reclusive initially, I became my usual self over time. I learnt many things, met new people and made friends, too. I didn’t care about what was happening outside. This is not a dance or music reality show, where one needs to plan. Just like how I cry, laugh, fight with my friends and family outside, I lived my life in the same manner inside the house. I felt as if I was back in college.The first thing I did once I got back from the show was to ask my athai ponnunga about my behaviour. They said that I behaved the same way inside the house, as I do outside with them. I wanted to entertain and keep all those 15 people happy. It became a problem because it was shown on TV. But audiences took it too seriously… They liked me while playing Saravanan (in Saravanan Meenatchi) a flirty, fun guy, but not when I did it as Kavin. I usually don’t regret any of my decisions, but, if there is something at all, it is perhaps my behaviour in the house.That I didn’t change myself for anything or anyone. Like I mentioned in the show, I didn’t want to win the title. I used this more like a platform to recharge myself. I thought I went offline as I had no releases for a while and wanted people to remember me. But I am glad to hear from my friends that I remained myself and didn’t put up an act in any situation.I am single.Hmm… a lot has changed. The kind of love that I believed in when I was in school and college is different from what I think of it now. Back then, I simply wanted to settle down with a nice Trichy girl. But now, it’s different. Usually, we say that a relationship without expectations is friendship. I think that applies to love as well. Love thrives if we can accept someone the way they are and don’t expect anything in return. It should be unconditional, honest and trustworthy.I am a die-hard romantic! If I love someone, I will go any extreme to make her happy. I will look out for those small things that she would have liked as a child and forgotten. I will ask her friends or family about those tiny details and surprise her at unexpected moments. It is filmy, but I am like that.Eyes. That’s perhaps the first thing I notice in a woman. I also like women, who are simple and independent.Lack of trust!I really don’t know. Marriage is a part of our culture. I know couples who are happily married for over a decade, and those who’ve gotten divorced in six months. Married or not, all that matters is love.I am a big Thala fan. He is extremely good looking and rocks the salt-and-pepper look like nobody else. In Viswasam, he went all out with grey. He presented himself just the way he is and sported the look with confidence. Among female stars, I am an all-time Trisha fan. In Bigg Boss, there was a task that involved us taking up the role of a cinema character. Now, Trisha had shared an Insta story of a contestant’s (Losliya) 96 Jaanu’s portrayal. I appear for a nanosecond in that video. My friends told me about this and saved the video for me. My happiness knew no bounds. I am certain that Trisha doesn’t know me, but amazingly, I got be a part of that video.Well, I am doing a film now. The official announcement will be made soon. I got some film offers before I went inside the house. I made a list of people who I wanted to work with. Once I got out, I went to those same people for films. I want to do films that are entertaining.I think it’s my laugh. People would have seen on TV… I laugh wholeheartedly.Once I got back from the BB house, I saw this video about how I live. Apparently, I live in a bungalow, earn rupees 2lakh per month, am married and settled with two kids. I wanted this to be true. My life would be set, no?Nobody should come in between two people who are in love. Just listen to them when they are going through tough times — and do that without judging them. That’s the biggest gift you can give them.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73768808,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-906821/73768808.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/tamil/most-desirable-man-on-television-2019-kavin/articleshow/73768808.cms
12,['31/01/2020'],"Noorin Shereef: Every film set scares me first, and I slowly get on track","She’s just 20 years old and is still in college, but Noorin Shereef has made a name for herself within a short time. Alongside her acting profile, people also love her unconventional golden curly locks, her smile and even her mean moves on the dance floor. Noorin, who has a bunch of interesting projects in her kitty tells us about her films, her plans and more.The youngster is just done with Praveen Raj ’s Velleppam, in which she plays an artist named Kalina . “The movie is set in Velleppam Angadi of Thrissur, and revolves around the problems and lives of people in this area. My character is a Christian girl who is an outsider, and lands there to paint the famous Veliyapalli of the area. A few issues crop up around her in the church in the story,” says Noorin.The actress says that unlike the role in her first film Oru Adaar Love, this is a matured character. “In Oru Adaar Love, I mostly just had to be myself, as she too was a student my age. However, though Kalina is a playful extrovert, she is also a mature, capable person. She also has to be a lot more romantic and emotional, which was challenging for me at first. However, director Praveen chettan and the film’s team helped me immensely to handle it well,” explains Noorin.As we talk, she is gearing up to start the shoot of her next film Maradu, starring Anoop Menon and directed by Kannan Thamarakkulam. “It is based on the recent flat demolition episode in Kochi. I play someone who used to live in one of the apartments there and the movie shows what the people went through, where they go and more,” says the artiste, who had also debuted in Telugu recently. Her movie Ullala Ullala had veteran actor Satya Prakash’s son Nataraj as part of the cast. “I was scared at first, but slowly adapted to it. I guess it got easier as the production team of the film is the same as that of Oru Adaar Love’s Telugu version Lovers Day. While the experience in Malayalam is quite homely, they were all about being professional and that was quite new to me. Sometimes one would even wonder why it’s so different!” says the Kollam native. She confesses that tension grips her initially on every set. “But, I try my best to be myself and slowly, things fall in place.”Alongside her films, Noorin is also a third year BBA student at MSN College, Chavara. “I joined the college even before I turned a celebrity so it’s a comfortable space. However, it’s interesting when juniors inquire ‘Isn’t this Noorin’s college?’ (laughs).” Apparently, she has no plans to side-line education for movies. Noorin explains, “I love dance and will definitely continue with that. I also want to do good movies, but don’t want to take undue pressure on it on my head – if I get good opportunities well and good and if not, that’s cool too. I want to continue studies and find a job as well. It’s not that my life is all about movies,” says Noorin. She says that her supportive family gives her occasional motivational talks! “That’s something that keeps me going and strong,” says Noorin.The social media enthusiast often discusses her looks, especially her corkscrew locks that she boldly wears in different colours. “I don’t consider myself very pretty,” says Noorin, explaining, “But, I like to be inventive with fashion within my own limitations and go for variety make up and different hair colours. I have tried many different shades like gold, brown, mixed shades and even red – I’m crazy about it. But now, I can’t do it as much as I used to, as one has to also take it account the film that I am shooting for. I do want to try a lot more different colours and probably carry them during a promotion or so,” says the youngster, who adds she takes good care of the coloured hair. “I don’t go for permanent hair colouring, ever and always take into account whether it will affect my hair texture, etc.” Interestingly, people often ask her why not try the straight hair look. “I have tried it a few times and those who have seen me know that I look the best in my natural curls. I don’t look myself when I straighten my hair and it’s in my curls that I am the most confident,” says Noorin, who also has two movies – Meppadiyan and Chocolate 2 with Unni Mukundan , coming up.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73772745,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-668258/73772745.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/noorin-shereef-every-film-set-scares-me-first-and-i-slowly-get-on-track/articleshow/73772748.cms
13,['31/01/2020'],Chinmayi files nomination for the post of president of Dubbing Union,"The election for various posts at the South Indian Cine, Television Artistes and Dubbing Artistes Union, popularly known as the dubbing union , will be held on February 15. While Radha Ravi, whose tenure will come to an end in March, is contesting for the president’s post again, taking him head-on this time around will be Chinmayi . The singer-dubbing artiste filed her nomination yesterday.For those who’re not clued in, the dubbing union had terminated Chinmayi’s membership in 2018, alleging that she hadn’t paid her subscription fee. However, those in the know claim that the singer was banned from the union only after she started sharing stories of #MeToo victims who accused Radha Ravi and lyricist Vairamuthu. Though she was active in Tollwyood, she hadn’t done much work as a voice artiste in the last couple of years. Chinmayi soon moved court and was granted an interim stay order in 2019. Post that, she managed to dub for Hero, which released in December. And now, she has filed her nomination to contest in the election. The dubbing union has also been embroiled in other controversies, including funds misappropriation, as alleged by a few members.Speaking to us a few minutes after filing her nomination, Chinmayi said, “The union has appointed retired justice Mr Ravi as the election officer. I’ve dropped my nomination in the dropbox kept at the dubbing union office. My nomination will be scrutinised and the status will be out in a few days.”She will be contesting for the post of president on behalf of Ramarajiyam Team. “In the last election, in 2018, the team had secured 45 per cent of vote. They have been fighting for the members who have faced problems,” she noted. Interestingly, a few members had opposed her contesting the election, saying she was not a member of the union. Her name was also removed from the voters list a few days ago. “The order copy of the ad interim injunction says that I have all the rights of a member, which means I have the rights to vote and also to contest. What they are saying is a violation of the order,” she told us.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73768391,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1033811/73768391.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/chinmayi-files-nomination-for-the-post-of-president-of-dubbing-union/articleshow/73768391.cms

18,['31/01/2020'],Restaurant Review: Biryani Guru,"It was exciting. And exacting. And exhausting. I was on a Navi Mumbai exploratory round. And I ended up in the delicious value for money Biryani Guru. All thanks to my other set of gurus — my #foodieblinddates. In this case, it was the vivacious, Zulekha Jabeel, who’s been running her small business for 27 years in Navi Mumbai. She loves cooking and entertaining at home and also eating out. I drove in from South Mumbai and met my #foodieblinddate directly in the restaurant and spent an amazing afternoon.Cheerful. Well-lit. Decorated with photos of musicians, from Bhimsen Joshi to Mick Jagger. A warm, happy vibe infused the ground-floored restaurant.Of course, you must opt for the biryanis (choice of 15) but before that, ask for the plump, well-marinated, boldly flavoured fish tikka with hammering notes of garlic, the velvety soft paneer delightful with black pepper. Richly succulent with cheese, chicken kebab and fleshy, tasty bhatti kumbh. Sounds strange but the ‘Istanbul Pardah Biryani’ came up tops. Cut through the sphere, with it’s thick coating into the moist, flavoursome mutton biryani. Also must-try the ‘Bombay Matka Biryani’ for its long-grained rice, vibrant with masala. End with the silken, sweet delicious caramel custard. Plenty of choices for vegetarians.I met Alok Sharma who drove all the way from Vashi and was waiting to pick up biryani as a takeaway, since it’s the best here.Some of the dishes were over-spiced and even oversweet, like the butter chicken. Leathery garlic naan.Details: Piquant homemade capsicum chutney, tangy, silken beetroot chutney and, of course, robustly spiced, tasty biryanis and kababs make this a must visit if you happen to be in the vicinity. It’s moderately priced and it’s open throughout the day. It sure is a biryani lovers mecca, which lives up to its name — Biryani Guru.Mermaid 1, Opposite Indian Naval Canteen, Sector 11,CBD-Belapur, Navi MumbaiTimings: 10 am to 11 pmMeal for two: Rs.1,000",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73769676,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-100998/73769676.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/food-news/restaurant-review-biryani-guru/articleshow/73769643.cms

20,['31/01/2020'],"Nitin Kakkar: The reality is, people prefer to watch movies that feature stars, and producers back films that have stars in it","He enjoys his share of indie space, what with winning a National Award for a film in a similar zone — Filmistaan (2012). However, director Nitin Kakkar reasons that in a country where films are dominated by stars, it is hard to survive in that space alone. With his upcoming film Jawaani Jaaneman , he tried his hand at directing a star, Saif Ali Khan . In a conversation with BT, he shares his experience of working on a typical commercial masala entertainer, discovering Bollywood debutante Alaya F and Sara Ali Khan’s exit from the project. Excerpts…I made Filmistaan in 2012, and it did the rounds of various festivals where it was received really well, but it hit the theatres only in 2014. It was almost funny, as festivals were going gaga about it, but the local producers and distributors were not even looking at it. Winning the National Award did something good, as we finally got buyers. That gave me the push to make one more indie film, Ramsingh Charlie (2015-16). It starred Kumud Mishra and Divya Dutta, but it never released as we couldn’t find buyers for it. We are a star-led industry. People prefer to watch movies that feature stars, and producers back films that have stars in it. This is the reality. Today, the digital medium has opened up, and it has led to a big demarcation. Big films are set for theatrical release, whereas indie films are pushed towards OTT platforms. I got that opportunity too, but hello, I want my indie film to release in a theatre and not on any OTT platform.I got a firsthand experience of working with stars when I assisted director Siddharth Malhotra on We Are Family (2010). Films starring big actors give you better budget to justify your vision. Talking about Saif, I must say that he is a witty, well-read and intelligent man. He is never scared to experiment. As artistes, we are meant to experiment and push ourselves towards uncomfortable zones. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but the point is to keep trying. Tabu is a very honest person. In this industry, you can make out who’s fake and who’s not. I found her to be an honest soul.The best thing about Alaya is that she is well prepared. In fact, she has been prepping for this moment for years now. She is one of the most confident 21-year-olds I have ever seen. I never felt that she was a debutante. We did a few reading sessions before we began the shoot. So, it wasn’t like directing a debutant and a senior actor, but a fresh, well-prepared ‘actor’ and a senior ‘actor’. So, their duet scenes went really smooth.Yes, Sara was there, but one fine day, I was told that she was not doing the film. I don’t know what happened between Saif, who was producing the film, the rest of the team and Sara. However, I looked at it very positively. Alaya was a fresh face. There was no baggage to her, while Sara’s Kedarnath (2018) was set for release. She was also shooting for Simmba (2018). I am glad that we discovered Alaya. I was shooting for Notebook in Srinagar, when I asked her to join the team. I spent an entire day with her, and I could see my character in her personality. There are a lot of similarities between the two — for example, the way they look at relationships. In our society, divorces and separations are taboo even now, but Alaya has dealt with it in real life in a mature way (her parents, actress Pooja Bedi and businessman Farhan Furniturewala,are divorced). Alaya totally fit the bill for me. It is because of this change in casting that the film got pushed; otherwise, I was supposed to work on it before Notebook.Currently, I am developing a story which I want to direct. I always wanted to make my directorial debut with a black-and-white film. I had even written the script and was on the lookout for a producer. I am going to take that project ahead now, seriously. It is going to be my next.

21,['31/01/2020'],The art of composting: Turn your organic waste into natural fertilisers,"As people get increasingly eco-conscious and seek to eat organic, here's how you can make compost at home for your organic kitchen gardenEco-consciousness among people has been on the rise, especially when it comes to making informed choices about the food they consume. This in turn has lead to a boom in organic farming, and now, many city folks have switched to organic kitchen gardening in their lawns or balconies to ensure that their food is free from chemicals such as fertilisers and pesticides. And even those who do not grow food, want to keep their house plants healthy, so they’re switching to organic fertilisers and composting. If you are also planning to turn a new leaf and try composting, here are a few things you should keep in mind when you are getting started.Compost is decayed organic matter, which includes food waste, dry leaves, twigs among other things. When they are put together in a composter or a pit, they break down naturally into a nutrient-rich fertiliser.You don't need a large space to compost – your balcony is good enough. Simply buy a composter, preferably a terracotta one, and start layering it with wet organic matter, dry leaves and twigs. Once full, cover it and let it sit in an airy place. Keep mixing the matter every other day, to ensure proper aeration and moisture content. In about 45 days, your compost will be ready.Tip: Place a plate or a container at the base of your composter to collect the liquid that comes out. This liquid, called leachate, is extremely strong and is an excellent fertiliser. However, it should be used diluted, otherwise, it can burn the plants.Contrary to what many think, composting at home is quite easy. ""Home composting is a simple process based on two basic principles: adequate air and water. It's like taking care of a potted plant while understanding the science behind composting,"" says Smita Ahuja, a working professional and an eco-warrior, who has been composting at home since 2016.Sangeeta Nayyar, a Gurgaon resident, began composting 30 years ago. ""The MCD people would simply burn the leaves. So, I dug a pit and asked them to put the leaves in it. It turned to compost, and I asked my maali to use it for our plants,"" she tells us. Smita adds that composting ""has reduced her household waste by almost 50%"".Both Smita Ahuja and Sangeeta Nayyar, who do home composting, replicated their composting models as a society in their condominiums in Gurgaon. While Sangeeta was successful, Smita's society didn't continue with community composting. Sangeeta tells us that her condominium has about 25 bins for composting. ""We do not use machines. We have employed two people to rake the compost bin and ensure there is adequate water and air. Since we fill one bin at a time, we have compost ready by the time we fill up the last bin,"" she shares.Not just in your homes, you can also compost as a community. Societies have community composters where residents can deposit their organic waste. The waste is then raked every other day till the compost is readyRahul Khera, the founder of a company that helps provide waste management and community composting solutions, tells us that for successful community composting, 90-95% people should be composting. ""Community composting requires space, and that’s the first question municipal corporations ask us, that how will we procure the space required for composting,"" he adds. Rahul currently runs projects in 15 societies across NCR.Priya Mehrish, another Gurgaon resident, adds, ""In our society, we use machines to crush the food waste, which is then squeezed to remove moisture. This is mixed with leaves and put in large bins. Lime carbonate is added to maintain pH levels, and the compost is ready in three weeks.""In both Sangeeta Nayyar and Priya’s condominiums, the residents are provided with compost for free. ""12kg/year is free for the residents; for any excess, residents can buy it at a nominal price. Also, any remaining compost we have is sold to the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram for about Rs 5/kg,"" Priya tells us.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73767221,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-467229/73767221.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/home-garden/the-art-of-composting-turn-your-organic-waste-into-natural-fertilisers/articleshow/73767152.cms

He added, ""For Sanjna, theatre is a family affair. Her parents, Jennifer Kandal and Shashi Kapoor , met in Calcutta, where the tours of their respective parents' theatre companies had taken them.

There is a lot that we can learn from France about how it manages its cultures and its policies. I hope this ignites more policymakers and thinkers in our country to think about what role they can play in promoting arts and culture in the country."" She added, ""France has done some amazing things, especially in the field of circus, something that I am passionate about. It believes that a circus is an art form that belongs to everybody. I believe strongly, too, that art is for everybody, and not just for the elite or some section of the society.

‘Come and take your freedom', screams shooter as cops watch

NEW DELHI: A peaceful protest by students of Jamia Millia University against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on Thursday afternoon was disrupted by a shocking act of firing by a gunman in front of a police contingent and cameras telecasting the event live. As a student tried to reason with him, the gunman fired, injuring the student’s left hand, before he was taken into custody by the cops.The shooter, according to police, is a juvenile and his age is being verified. He was using a countrymade weapon which has a short range. Police have come under fire from many eyewitnesses and observers for not making any effort to rein in the youth when he was walking backwards towards them, waving the gun and shouting slogans. The cops were seen watching nonchalantly and one of them intervened quite late, after the man had fired. He handed over the gun to them and was taken away. A case of attempt to murder has been filed against him.The incident came after days of intense campaigning for the Delhi assembly elections when rhetoric on Shaheen Bagh has taken centrestage.It was around 1.40pm when the 17-year-old shooter, wearing white trousers and a black jacket, entered the protest site by climbing over the roadside grilles near Gate No. 4 of the university on Okhla Marg. The students — about 400 — were planning to march to Rajghat where they would have formed a human chain.Instead of joining the protesters , the youth started walking ahead of them, hurling abuses. One of the protesters, Shadab Farooq , along with some volunteers, approached the man and asked him to fall back in line so that they could begin the protest. However, the man hurled abuses at Farooq, whipped out a countrymade pistol and started threatening to shoot the protesters.In videos that went viral on social media, the youth is seen waving the pistol in the air and walking ahead of the protest while media persons and volunteers try to persuade him to drop the weapon. “He kept shouting at the protesters. ‘Aake le lo Azadi,’ he screamed. Before opening fire, he shouted, ‘Hindustan mein rehna hoga to Vande Mataram kehna hoga’,” said TOI photographer Tarun Rawat, who was at the scene when the incident unfolded.“We had thought he was among the protesters at first, but when he started waving the gun, we were taken aback and tried to convince him to drop the weapon. He walked with his back towards the police for a few metres and then suddenly opened fire at Farooq,” said one of Farooq’s batchmates. “The police were at a distance and had slowly started moving despite being alerted about the man carrying a gun,” she said.Witnesses say that after hearing the gunshot, they saw Farooq and his woman friend crouching on the road with blood oozing out of Farooq’s left hand. By this time, the policeman who had started walking towards the shooter took away the pistol and led him away.DCP (Southeast) Chinmoy Biswal said that since no permission was given to the protesters to hold a march, a barricade had been put up near Holy Family Hospital to stop them. The entire force was deployed behind the barricades, except for a few officers. “The incident happened within the few seconds during which the officers got alerted and the suspect opened fire. We immediately apprehended him,” he said.During the initial interrogation, the youth claimed that he had travelled to Delhi from a village near Jewar in UP with the intent of teaching the protesters a lesson. He claimed he was not affiliated with any organisation.Meanwhile, Farooq’s classmates rushed him to the barricades, asking the cops to remove them. “We requested the police to allow us to go through since Farooq was shot but they asked him to climb over the barricade. We had to haul him up over the barricade and go to the other side before walking to the hospital,” said one of his classmates. Farooq was then referred to AIIMS trauma centre.The police have registered a case of attempt to murder under Section 307 IPC and under Arms Act. They are in the process of verifying the age of the accused since he has produced his Aadhaar card and certificates that mention his age to be 17 years and nine months. However, the date of birth mentioned in his Class X CBSE marksheet, which TOI has accessed, is April 8, 2002, which makes him older. It was found that he had procured the weapon from an arms dealer in UP. Police have informed his family and will produce him before the juvenile justice board.Meanwhile, Election Commission has sought a report regarding the law and order situation from the police commissioner after the incident. Two senior police officers met the injured student at the trauma centre on Thursday evening.In Video: Shaheen Bagh: 'Khel Khatam, Le Lo Azaadi', says youth",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73782418,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-850553,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/on-martyrs-day-17-year-old-fires-at-anti-caa-march-in-presence-of-cops/articleshow/73782381.cms

Coronavirus scare: 15 put in isolation wards in Kerala

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The first case of the new strain of a coronavirus (nCoV) in the country was reported from Thrissur, Kerala , on Thursday. A young woman studying medicine at a university in the Chinese city of Wuhan , the epicentre of the nCoV outbreak, has tested positive for the virus that has killed 170 people in China and has spread to other countries, including the US.State health minister K K Shailaja said the student was hospitalised after she developed symptoms of fever and a sore throat. She was quarantined, along with four others, in the isolation ward of the general hospital in Thrissur. “The student who has tested positive for the virus is stable; there is nothing to worry,” she said. The five students, who had returned from Wuhan, had come to the hospital of their own volition. Three of them were shifted to Thrissur Medical College Hospital by Thursday afternoon. Swabs and blood taken from them have been sent for tests.Meanwhile, at a high-level review meeting in Delhi, cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba decided that all those who have come from China after January 15, 2020 will be tested as the virus has an incubation period. Apart from China, 15 other countries have reported a total of 68 confirmed cases so far.In Kerala, the medical college principal, Dr M A Andrews, said the three had been shifted to the hospital’s specially prepared isolation ward. Two more patients, including the student who tested positive, remain in the isolation ward. A final decision on shifting them will be taken later. The health minister, principal secretary (health) Rajan N Khobragade and other officials are expected to reach Thrissur late Thursday night. Khobragade was informed about the case in Thrissur in a video conference with the Union cabinet secretary, the health secretary and health secretaries of all states on Thursday. “The Union health ministry confirmed that one out of the six blood samples sent for tests to NIV Pune has tested positive. However, a gene identification test result is pending. This will reaffirm the status of the case,” Khobragade said.Meanwhile, 1,053 people who have returned from virus-hit regions are under observation in the state. Of these, 15 have been admitted to isolation wards of various hospitals in the state. Of the total 24 samples sent for tests to date, only one among them has tested positive.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73783088,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1164607,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indias-1st-coronavirus-case-reported-in-kerala/articleshow/73782800.cms
26,['31/01/2020'],MEA starts its biggest internal rejig in 50 years,"Foreign minister S Jaishankar is putting his plans of redrawing the MEA structure to work (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The foreign ministry is undertaking its biggest restructuring exercise in almost half a century, making it the Centre’s first ministry to undertake ‘root-branch’ structural reform.The ministry’s management and functioning structure remains hidebound and out of sync with modern practices and demands of India’s foreign policy, which is becoming more complex and diverse.With foreign secretary Harsh Shringla taking charge this week, foreign minister S Jaishankar is putting his plans of redrawing the MEA structure to work. It helps that Shringla and Jaishankar are on the same page regarding the overhaul, and getting it out early in the government’s tenure means they will have ample time to put the plans into action.The new structure will be more corporate in nature. MEA will build a series of ‘verticals’ like economic and trade diplomacy, development partnership, consular, emerging areas like technology etc. Each of these verticals will be headed by the equivalent of “political directors” at the additional secretary level. The idea is to decentralise the present pyramid-like structure, to separate routine foreign policy work from strategic projects. This will leave the secretaries to handle the big-ticket issues.On Thursday, MEA created the first verticals. Akhilesh Mishra, the current head of ICCR (Indian Council for Cultural Relations) will oversee all the four development partnership divisions. These are key to India’s overseas aid and development projects, particularly in the neighbourhood and Africa. Dinesh Patnaik will take over ICCR and handle the entire cultural diplomacy portfolio. P Harish will oversee the economic diplomacy initiative, leading the multilateral economic diplomacy and states division. Nagma Mallik will have three Africa divisions reporting to her. She will relinquish her current job as joint secretary, policy planning to Anupam Ray, who has just returned from Houston. Vikram Doraiswami will take charge of all multilateral work, overseeing political, economic and conferences and summits. He will give up his charge as head of Indo-Pacific to Neena Malhotra, who will oversee Indian Ocean, Indo-Pacific, and south-east Asia, with Smita Pant taking over as joint secretary ( Bangladesh and Myanmar ).Consular issues, an increasingly important area, emerging strategic technologies, cyber will be the future areas of expertise to be woven into the MEA structure. MEA recently set up the NEST (new and emerging strategic technologies) division. India wants to be part of the global rule-making order in these areas, so stands to reason that MEA should build policy expertise here.Currently, the system puts enormous pressure on joint secretaries as well as the four secretaries, making running the ministry and India’s foreign policy a continuous fire-fighting exercise, leaving little or no space for strategic planning, initiatives, etc. The new system is designed to break some of the silos that MEA currently functions under, align the Indian system with global powers, which will answer a perennial problem MEA faces when organising official dialogues with their international counterparts – of a mismatch in designations.With a reputation of having one of the smallest foreign services in the world, MEA will need to get creative about staffing. At present they take in officials from other services, but soon that pool will be expanded from the private sector, think tanks, etc. In addition, MEA plans to deploy its people in other key ministries like commerce, defence, finance, science & technology, etc. There are two reasons for this – international cooperation is increasingly being used for domestic development goals and India’s internal decisions have a foreign policy impact. This cross-pollination is intended to synergise the two goals.The exercise has just started, and it will take a few months, perhaps even a year to straighten out the knots at the operational level. But MEA may become a trailblazer in the Indian government.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73783388,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-432168,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mea-starts-its-biggest-internal-rejig-in-50-years/articleshow/73783309.cms

28,['31/01/2020'],Nirbhaya: SC rejects another curative plea,"This story is from January 31, 2020

Supreme Court of India

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed the curative petition of Akshay Thakur, one of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape-and-murder case . It had earlier dismissed the curative pleas of two other convicts, Vinay Sharma and Mukesh Singh . Only Pawan Gupta has so far not filed a similar plea.

“We have gone through the curative petitions and the relevant documents. In our opinion, no case is made out within the parameters indicated in the decision of this court in Rupa Ashok Hurra vs Ashok Hurra & Another, reported in 2002 (4) SCC 388. Hence, the curative petitions are dismissed,” a bench of Justices N V Ramana, Arun Mishra, R F Nariman, R Banumathi and Ashok Bhushan said.

The court dismissed Thakur’s plea seeking open court hearing on his petition and passed the order after examining the plea in chamber.

The court had on Wednesday rejected Singh’s plea challenging the President’s declining his mercy plea and said there was no illegality in the decision. With the dismissal of his plea, Singh has now exhausted all legal remedies to avoid execution of his death sentence.

The trial court on January 17 issued death warrants for the second time for the execution of all four convicts in the case — Singh (32), Gupta (25), Sharma (26) and Thakur (31) — in Tihar Jail at 6 am on February 1. Earlier, on January 7, the court had fixed January 22 as the hanging date.

LUCKNOW/AGRA: The nine-hour hostage crisis at a village in UP’s Farrukhabad district finally came to an end hours after midnight after crack commandos of the UP police stormed into the house of a murder convict, who had held 23 children captive since Thursday afternoon. Hostage-taker Subhash Batham was shot dead by the police and all 22 children were rescued. One girl held hostage was earlier released.A huge cache of arms and ammunition was also seized from his house godown where he had held the children hostage. The operation was spearheaded by IG, Kanpur Range, Mohit Agarwal, with support from the quick response team, special operation group and Anti-Terrorism Squad of the UP police. During the hostage crisis, Subhash hurled a crude bomb and fired shots from a country-made pistol at villagers and police personnel, injuring three of them.Hostage-taker's wife, who was thrashed by locals, succumbed to her injuries on Friday morning, IG Kanpur Mohit Agarwal said.He even threw out a letter of demands for the district magistrate, in which, he accused state officials of not providing his family with a house under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana or even a toilet under the Swachh Mission.The incident took place in Kathariya village under Mohammadabad police jurisdiction, where Subhash invited children to his house for a party and then locked them in. According to locals, Subhash appeared to be heavily drunk. He was accused in four criminal cases other than a murder case in which he was convicted and given a life term. NSG commandos were kept on standby.Earlier in the day, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath convened a high-level meeting on the hostage incident. The meeting was attended by the chief secretary, principal secretary (home), DGP and the ADGP (law and order).

NEW DELHI: This winter season continues to make news. December saw record-breaking cold in the north and now January is the wettest India has experienced in 15 years. Met records show countrywide rainfall during this month has been 67% above normal (till January 30), with north, and east and northeast regions receiving almost 80% surplus rains.Experts said the wet conditions and cold conditions in January, particularly over north India, have been ideal for rabi crops such as wheat, which is heading for a bumper harvest.All-India average rainfall in January so far has been 27.9mm, highest since 2005, when 28.1mm was recorded, met records reveal. Winter rainfall is mainly regulated by western disturbances (WDs) — pulses of moist winds travelling from regions close to the Mediterranean, which bring wet weather to north and, at times, central India.“Normally, there are five to seven WDs in January. This month, we got 10. Not just that, many of these WDs came in through a more southerly path which brought rainfall to the northern plains in addition to the western Himalayan states,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, head of India Meteorological Department .An additional factor brought rain to many parts of central India as well. “This month, we saw several of the WDs being supported by easterly winds from Bay of Bengal . The confluence of the two systems increased the geographical spread of the rainfall, with Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha too getting wet weather,” Mohapatra said.The weather in January was quite a contrast to December, when there were no WDs for a 16-17 day period — except for a single, weak disturbance — during which day temperatures remained way below normal in north India, leading to the longest “cold day” spell over the region since 1901.In January, a WD has hit north India every three days on average, not only bringing frequent rain spells but also preventing a sharp fall in temperatures. So, while January remained cold, there were no extreme temperature events.“Weather conditions this month, at least over north India, have been very good for rabi crops, particularly wheat. We have got rain every few days while there has hardly been any heavy rain or just a few hail spells. Also, fog episodes have been few and crops have received sufficient sunshine,” said M L Jat, a senior agriculture scientist with the non-profit International Wheat and Maize Improvement Centre, better known by its Spanish acronym, Cimmyt.In line with the weather conditions so far, among other factors, several agencies have forecast a record wheat production this year, which could bring some cheer to the rural economy that has seen a slowdown in recent months.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73784205,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-492016,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-cold-december-indias-wettest-january-in-15-years/articleshow/73784199.cms

PM Narendra Modi at an all-party meet ahead of the Budget Session in New Delhi on Thursday (PTI)

NEW DELHI: The opposition drew the Centre’s attention to the anti-CAA protests and communal statements from BJP functionaries in Delhi elections even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the government was ready to discuss all issues in Parliament , exposing the political fault-lines which may make the budget session a stormy affair.

At the all-party meeting on the eve of the parliament session on Thursday, the government and the opposition laid out their priorities. It was attended by 26 parties and included seniors like Ghulam Nabi Azad , Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and Anand Sharma of Congress, T R Baalu of DMK, Sudip Bandyopadhyay of TMC, Navaneethakrishnan of AIADMK and Pinaki Misra of BJD among others.

The opposition, led by Congress, was emphatic that greater focus was required on the economic situation, rising unemployment and anti-CAA protests even as they pointed to controversies arising from non-stop communal remarks from BJP in the Delhi campaign. They also demanded the release of political detainees in Jammu and Kashmir .

Interestingly, while the opposition focused on economic distress, the PM displayed optimism on the issue.

According to an official statement, Modi said, “Most of the members have asked for discussion on the economic situation concerning the country. I welcome this and we need to discuss the economic issues as suggested by you all. We should focus on how we can turn the global scenario in favour of India.”

However, CAA continues to be the flashpoint which may mar the budget session.

Azad accused the government of focussing merely on passage of its bills and spoke about the nation-wide protests against CAA. “We brought the government's attention to these protests. The government has displayed arrogance by not reaching out to protesters to hear their concerns,” he told reporters.

In contrast, parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi said the bill was passed by Parliament following a long discussion and asked rival parties to introspect their role in the protests.

Some participants raised the “incendiary” statements made by BJP functionaries during the Delhi poll campaign and asked Modi to intervene.

Urging parties to help increase business transacted in the House, Modi said, “In the last two sessions, we saw increased productivity and the great public response in favour of it. As people's representatives, it is our responsibility to increase productivity of the House while we discuss all issues with an open mind.”

He added, “In this budget session and in the beginning of the new year, if we can give a proper direction to the country's economy, it would be in the best interest of the country.

NEW DELHI: Terming the Bodo agreement a historic chapter for peace, development and unity in Assam , Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said the accord sent a clear message that non-violence and adherence to democracy and the Constitution could help resolve issues.

“Bodo friends joining us on the path of peace sends a clear message that solution to issues is possible when we leave the path of violence and repose faith in democracy and Constitution. I welcome my Bodo friends to the mainstream. We are committed to ensuring the development of Bodo areas,"" the PM said in a series of tweets.

As per the agreement, all Bodo outfits have decided to give up their militant campaign for creation of a separate homeland. This was the second time in a week when the PM emphasised that peaceful means were better suited for resolution of problems. On Sunday, he had stressed on the importance of non-violence in his ‘Mann ki Baat’ address on Sunday.

His return to the theme on Mahatma Gandhi ’s martyrdom day was seen in the context of anti-CAA protests. The stir, which has seen protesters invoking Gandhiji, has also sparked violence in many places.

“Nation's development can be given momentum only in an environment free of violence and fear. Happy that entire energy of our Bodo friends will further strengthen Assam's development,” Modi said, stressing that the agreement was inspired by the mantra of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwas ' and the spirit of 'Ek Bharat, Shresth Bharat '.

“This is a victory for all. It's a victory for humanity,"" he added.

Modi said after signing the historic agreement with Bodo organisations, the foremost priority of the government was the development of Bodo areas and work had begun on a comprehensive Rs 1,500 crore package.

PATNA: Nature lovers are making the most of the recently launched ecotourism package for the Valmiki Tiger Reserve (VTR) in West Champaran as all its slots have been booked till March.

According to VTR officials, the ecotourism package, which can be availed by 16 people simultaneously, has been in demand since its launch by the forest department on December 21 last year.

“The two-day package worth Rs 1,500 each includes transportation from Patna to the VTR, accommodation and food for 16 tourists. They can also enjoy jungle safari and canopy walk on Kauleshwar Jhoola and visit the Gandak riverfront,” VTR’s deputy director Gourav Ojha told this newspaper on Thursday.

Located 289 kilometres in the north of Patna in Tarai region of the Himalayas, the VTR comprises eight forest ranges with two divisions — Govardhana, Rangia, and Manguraha ranges in division I and Harnapand, Chiutaha, Madanpur, Valmiki Nagar, and Ganauli in division II.

The Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation (BSTDC) has been running a number of buses for tourists travelling to the VTR. “More than 60% of the bookings are made during the winter season, from mid-November to February. We offer special packages that include a visit to the eco park, elephant shed and the Jatashankar Temple. We also have a special nightlife package that is available on full moon nights,” a BSTDC official said.

People, who have availed the VTR package, recalled their amazing experiences. One of them, Rakesh Sharma, said, “My friends and I had gone to the VTR in the first week of January and had a lot of fun. The facilities were great too.”

Exhibition Road resident, Manoj Srivastava, enjoyed the jungle safari on a 14-seater open air vehicle. “We were taken to the Gandak pathway, but the best part was the Kauleshwar Jhoola,” he said.

Kadamkuan resident, Uma Shankar Prasad, is excited to visit the VTR in February. He said, “We were planning to go in January. However, all the slots were full and we had to extend the date.”

Monitoring of tigers through camera traps till February 15: The ongoing exercise of monitoring tigers using camera traps at the VTR is likely to continue till February 15. The photographs taken through the 500 pairs of camera traps will be sent to the Wildlife Institute of India (WWI) and processed before the annual tiger census is released.

The census work began in November-end last year with installation of 500 pairs of camera traps in division-II of the tiger reserve. Its divisional forest officer (DFO) Gourav Ojha said, “After monitoring the movement of tigers and other species for more than a month, the camera traps were removed from division II in the first week of January and placed in division- I.”

“Monitoring will continue till February 15. Thereafter, the recorded data will be submitted to the WWI for final processing,” Ojha added.

Varanasi: Ahead of the Union budget on February 1, Geographical Indication expert Padma Shri Dr Rajni Kant urged Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman for a budgetary allocation for National GI (Geographical Indication) Board to promote GI-tagged handicrafts on global level. Kant also urged for an enhanced allocation of fund for handloom sector.

“We are expecting something good for handloom and handicraft sectors in the Union budget for weavers and artisans and also to promote these goods globally,” Kant told reporters on Thursday.

He said that the handloom sector should be given an increased share in the budget. There is a need to establish a National GI Board so that exclusive GI certified products of the country could be promoted in international markets, he said.

The artisans should also be given facilities of solar subsidy, handicraft credit card on the lines of kisan credit card, and inclusion of all handicraft goods in a single GST slab of 5%, he said. A budgetary allocation is also needed for special training of artisans, packaging and marketing of goods. There should be a separate budget for woman weavers and artisans, and for the marketing of the goods produced by them.

Kant further said that there should be a special provision of GI tourist circuit and craft tourism for the interest of Indian crafts and craftsmen. “We also urge for a provision of special raw material depot and common facility centres for handicraft and handloom sectors,” he said adding that there should also be provision of promotional activities and marketing of Indian handicraft and handloom in foreign countries through the respective Indian embassies.

Additionally, pedestrian movement and safety will be on top of the police agenda as they prepare to divert vehicles into narrower roads from midnight on Friday. The emphasis came after back-to-back fatal accidents in the area over the past two days. Senior traffic officers led by joint CP (traffic) Santosh Kumar spent several hours in and around Tallah Bridge on Thursday as the top brass took stock of the possible challenges that may come up.The state has realigned more than 100 bus routes and engaged 1,766 buses for passengers travelling from the northern suburbs beyond Tallah Bridge to the city. “The idea is to reduce reliance on private vehicles so as to decongest the roads. In case of Majerhat, the sudden surge of private cars — which occupy a huge amount of road space but carry a lower number of commuters — left traffic unmanageable and the transport department needed to deploy buses to ease the issue,” said a transport department official.West Bengal Transport Corporation, a state transport undertaking, has realigned 26 routes and plans to deploy 148 buses to serve these routes. The movement of goods vehicles will be planned in consultation with Kolkata Police.“We will be coordinating with private operators so we can avoid overlapping buses. We have to make sure buses will be available throughout the day,” said a WBTC official.The Railways has introduced five trains between Barrackpore and BBD Bag and one train from Barrackpore to Sealdah . Metro has also increased frequency of services between Noapara and New Garia. The transport department will also provide connectivity between Noapara and Dum Dum Metro station from the nearest points.In October 2019, the transport department started ferry services from Kuthighat to Fairlie Place via Bagbazar Ghat. “It was a success and we are planning to strengthen the services. We also plan to extend operations till Alam Bazar Ghat so we can reduce congestion in Baranagar and Cossipore .Pedestrian safety will be prioritized once the traffic movement is realigned. Several key roads in the area, including Cossipore Road, which is expected to bear a large chunk of traffic once Tallah Bridge is shut, do not even have proper pavements. The scene is similar on Khagen Chatterjee Road. The police said they have recommended the redevelopment of pavements and installation of lights, especially near schools and important crossings.Lalbazar said the proposed pedestrian walkway connecting Tallah Park with Tallah station will ease pedestrian movement at both ends of Tallah Bridge. Cops have been asked to clearly demarcate bus stops and ensure that a case is lodged if construction material is dumped on the road. “But this is one road where we cannot control crossovers and chances of accidents cannot be ruled out,” an officer said.“Neither Khagen Chatterjee Road nor Cossipore Road has a pavement. We have to walk down the road even though it is risky,” said Shakti Singh, a Cossipore resident.Cops said they also held a meeting with bus owners and auto operators on Thursday to apprise them of the situation. “It was not a meeting on the Tallah issue.

PATNA: The 6.6km-long promenade on the banks of the Ganga, officially known as Patna Ganga Riverfront Development (RFD) project, is likely to get extra grandeur with the introduction of laser shows from June this year.Apart from laser show, the Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation (BUIDCO), an agency of the state urban development and housing department (UDHD), has also decided to develop three more ghats – Bhadra Ghat, Mahavir Ghat and Nauzar Ghat – by June this year. Work on setting up infrastructure for laser shows would begin next month.A senior BUIDCO official said the UDHD has been urged to sanction Rs180 crore for construction of pathway on the three proposed ghats and introduction of other facilities, including laser shows.Chandrashekhar Singh, managing director of BUIDCO, said the proposed amenities would be developed at the three ghats by the end of June. “Of the 20 ghats in the first phase of Ganga RFD project, 16 have already been developed. Bhadra Ghat, Mahavir Ghat and Nauzar Ghat will now be taken up under phase 1 of the project. Laser shows will also be introduced to make the riverfront more attractive,” Singh said.Food kiosks, water pumps, landscaping, electric crematorium, high mast lights, sitting kiosks, benches, watchtowers and urinals are some of the facilities proposed to be developed in the remaining three ghats.Chandrashekhar said there will be 16 approach roads to reach 19 ghats between Collectorate Ghat and Nauzar Ghat.Meanwhile, promenades or pathways along the 16 ghats in the city between Collectorate Ghat and Rani Ghat have become a major attraction for residents. People visit the ghats from early in the morning. Fitness enthusiasts visit the place for morning walk, exercise and performing yoga.Students from various schools, colleges and universities also spend time with their friends and study in groups. It has become a picnic hotspot for families, while lovebirds also spend time in the sitting kiosks.Some major attractions are decorative lights, Madhubani painting on walls, decorated sitting kiosks, landscape, boat ride, 50-seater ship – MV Kautilya – which is run by the Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation and Ganga aarti in the evening.BUIDCO has also developed an eco-centre at Collectorate Ghat and an audio-visual theatre centre at Baharwa Ghat, which would soon be handed over to Patna Municipal Corporation .Visitors can see the artworks related to the Ganga, get information of its origin, river- course and its tributaries at the eco-centre.

43,['31/01/2020'],India clocks over 5.5 billion hours on TikTok in ’19,"(File photo)

BENGALURU: Indians clocked 5.5 billion hours on TikTok, the mobile application used to post 15-second short videos. This is an increase of over six times from the 900 million hours spent in 2018, according to data of Android users assessed by mobile and data analytics firm App Annie. TikTok outstripped growth of rival Facebook in the key battleground market for global user domination.The number of monthly active users (MAUs) on TikTok increased by 90% to 81 million as of December 2019, as compared to the same period in the previous year, as India emerged as the largest market outside the home base China. At the same time, Facebook saw total hours spent on the platform increase by 15% to 25.5 billion hours, while its MAUs as of December also increased by 15% to 224 million. Facebook-owned photosharing platform Instagram grew its MAUs much faster at 40% to 137 million as of December on Android, which is the dominant operating system with over 90% market share in India.While TikTok — owned by the world’s most valued startup ByteDance at $75 billion — remains behind global rival Facebook in terms of users and time spent, it is catching up fast. TikTok launched in India in September 2017, about 28 months ago, while Facebook, for whom the country is the largest market in terms of users, has been available since September 2006.The TikTok app was also downloaded 323 million times across both Apple’s App Store and Android devices in India in 2019 — over twice the 156 million times Facebook was, according to Sensor Tower data.“In December 2019, the total time spent on Tiktok in India was more than the next 11 countries combined. It is not only that there are more people engaging with TikTok, but there is deeper engagement per person,” said Lexi Sydow, senior market insights manager, App Annie. She added that what works for TikTok is that it is blurring the line between a social network and entertainment.TikTok’s India numbers have outstripped its global growth numbers — where time spent on the app grew over two times, while MAUs went 70% to 717 million, with a large majority in China, according to App Annie. Facebook is not operational in China.The numbers come at a time when TikTok is increasingly looking to monetise its fast-growing user base in the country as it has hired a top management team. TikTok is also eyeing Rs 100 crore in revenue for the July-September quarter, according to a report on Entrackr, up from Rs 23-25 crore in the December quarter.According to investors tracking the space, TikTok’s ability to create stars early in the life of the social network has attracted more users and content-creators on the platform, giving it the “viral loop”. “Their content format in full screen is also very engaging, as with one swipe you are on the next one, unlike other platforms where buffering takes time. In both their video-streaming technology and the application of artificial intelligence, they have truly pushed boundaries,” said Pratik Poddar , principal at Nexus Venture Partners , a VC firm. “And they are genuinely aggressive and not shied away from spending money.”",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73796391,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-32261,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-clocks-over-5-5bn-hours-on-tiktok-in-19/articleshow/73781016.cms

RAJKOT: Six persons were booked for allegedly pelting stones at the house of Jamnagar Municipal Corporation’s (JMC) councillor Umar Chamadia in Bedi locality over an old enmity on Wednesday night.

In his complaint, Chamadia, a BJP corporator of JMC ward number 1, alleged that the accused, identified as Hanif Bhokal, Mohsin Bhokal, Qadar Bhokal, Hasan Bhokal , Akhtar Gazia and Ayub Gazia, pelted stones at his house while he and his family members were sleeping on Wednesday night.

“After window glasses were shattered by stones, Chamadia came out of the house and the accused allegedly threatened to kill him. However, the accused fled after Chamadia’s neighbours gathered at the spot,” said K C Vaghela, sub-inspector with Jamnagar B division police station.

Chamadia alleged that the animosity had been brewing ever since he got elected as a councillor. “The Bhokals and the Gazias did not like the way I carried out development works in my ward. They had picked up fights with me in the past, and they resorted to stone pelting on Wednesday,” said Chamadia.

46,['31/01/2020'],Bihar: Kanhaiya Kumar starts yatra amid arrest rumours,"This story is from January 31, 2020

CPI leader Kanhaiya Kumar addresses a rally at Motihari on Thursday

BETTIAH/MOTIHARI: Amid high drama, CPI leader Kanhaiya Kumar set off on his ‘Save Constitution, Save Citizenship Satyagraha yatra’ from Mahatma Gandhi’s Bhitiharwa ashram in West Champaran on Thursday.

The former JNUSU president’s yatra on the Mahatma’s martyrdom anniversary was marked by cancellation of his scheduled public meeting at Bettiah, rumours of his arrest or detention and a flood of fake news.

He addressed a large crowd outside the Bhitiharwa ashram before being escorted beyond the boundaries of West Champaran via a circuitous route that dodged the waiting crowds near Bettiah. Greeting another large crowd at the Sports Club in Motihari later in the afternoon, Kanhaiya alleged that he was stopped at Bhitiharwa in a conspiracy that was thwarted by people’s support.

Kanhaiya’s Champaran yatra was preceded by clashes at Bettiah’s Meena Bazar on Wednesday when Bharat bandh supporters protesting against CAA-NRC clashed with shopkeepers. An ugly situation was saved by the prompt action by an alert district administration. “The permission for his public meeting (at the Aerodrome grounds) here was cancelled as meeting grounded was not adequately barricaded,” West Champaran DM Nilesh Ramchandra Deore told TOI.

The Bettiah meeting cancelled, a crowd began assembling at Kudiya Kothi, site of a Raj-era indigo factory, six km from Bettiah as word-of-mouth and Whatsap messages said Kanhaiya would hold a meeting here on his way back from Bhitiharwa. Police kept vigil at Kudiya Kothi. Meanwhile, Kanhaiya — after spending the night at his CPI comrade Om Prash Kranti’s house in Chanpatia— was stopped from leaving Kranti’s residence at 8 am. Allowed an hour later, as he drove out towards Bhitiharwa, a handful of BJP supporters shouted “go back Kanhaiya’ slogans near the Sikrahana bridge near Chanpatia.

A massive crowd greeted Kanhaiya, accompanied by his fellow JNUite and Congress MLA from Kadwa ( Katihar) Shakeel Ahmad Khan, as he entered the ashram gate to pay obeisance to the Mahatma on his martyrdom day. A CPM press release claimed that he was arrested, but Kanhaiya’s statement later at Motihari said, “I was stopped.”

Thanking the Bhitiharwa crowd for coming in such large numbers on Gandhiji’s day of martyrdom, Kanhaiya said, “The Mahatma was murdered because of his adherence to ishwar-allah tero naam, sabko sanmati de bhagwan” hymn and credo. “Today, we are in a situation where hatred is being fanned, a Hindu-Muslim divide is being deepened....people in their own country are being considered second class citizens.”

He added, “I was supposed to go to Motihari from here after a programme in Bettiah. But police, administration say: aapka permission cancel kar diya gaya hai.” Kanhaiya’s statement evoked a “Modi ji ka police hai” reaction from the crowd. A commotion erupted, only to be calmed by Kanhaiya. “He had the permission (to address people at Bhitiharwa),” DM Deore said, adding, the circulation of fake news (on the contrary) was unfortunate.

Meanwhile, at Kudiya Kothi, the ‘Kanhaiya arrested’ rumours and fake news were negated by ‘FaceBook live’ streaming that encaptured the assembled crowd huddled in groups glued to Kanhaiya’s Bhitiharwa speech on smart phones. An hour later, the crowd at the erstwhile indigo factory grounds began to disperse as news filtered in that Kanhaiya had been whisked out of the district through a diversionary route via the Triveni canal to Mainatar- Ghogha- Sariswa- Piparpainti bridge onto to the NH 28 B on the Sugauli- Raxaul road enroute Motihari.

At Motihari, describing the CAA-NRC as ‘black law’, Kanhaiya said, “ We do not acknowledge a government that does not consider us as citizens.” He appealed that people assemble at Patna ’s Gandhi Maidan on February 29 at the culmination of his yatra that he has set out from Champaran to cover Bihar.

Bettiah SP Nitasha Gudiya refuted claims of Kanhaiya’s arrest. “He was not arrested,” she categorically said.

Talking to TOI over phone, Kanhaiya said, “The administration is under pressure and officials were intentionally creating trouble to stop me from holding public meet. This is undemocratic.”

Even Shakeel alleged there was nothing wrong with the protest site at Bettiah and they had followed all instructions given by the administration. “The district administration officials inspected the site with me on Wednesday and first demanded the Tricolour to be removed from the stage. In late evening, they cancelled our permission to hold a public gathering there citing security reasons, but the fact is they are working on instruction of a particular political party.

Mumbai: Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) has brought in cricketing icons Sachin Tendulkar and M S Dhoni as brand ambassadors for the ‘ Mutual Fund Sahi Hai’ campaign. Tendulkar, one of the best batsmen ever and Dhoni, a world-cup winning captain for India, have been roped in to help create awareness about mutual funds being the preferred investment option among retail investors, Amfi said. Markets regulator Sebi doesn’t allow individual fund houses to have brand ambassadors, but in 2017 it had allowed the industry as a whole to go for celebrity endorsements. The Tendulkar-Dhoni combine is the first such endorsement for the fund industry.

According to Amfi chairman Nilesh Shah , Tendulkar and Dhoni “evoke unstinted trust and high dependability.” Shah feels the long careers of the two cricketers could be compared to retail investors having a long-term approach towards their investments. “Longer term approach, be it in cricketing career or in mutual fund investments, can deliver rich dividends for cricketers and investors alike,” Shah said.

The hugely successful ‘Mutual Funds Sahi Hai’ campaign was launched three years ago when Aditya Birla MF MD A Balasubramanian was Amfi president. Amfi CEO N S Venkatesh feels that with three years of refinement behind the campaign, the industry trade body felt that the time was right to take the conversation with the retail investors across the country to the next level and hence the cricketing icons were brought on board.

Tendulkar, after signing the deal with Amfi, said that discipline and longer term approach were the cornerstones in achieving success, “be it in any sport and likewise in personal investing.” According to Dhoni, having a goal-based approach, starting early, staying disciplined and not being fazed by volatility are the four mantras that the wicketkeeper-batsman always followed, be it in his cricketing career or in personal money management.

Chennai: Hyundai Motor India, which rolled out it’s 3 millionth export vehicle on Thursday, will make India an export hub for electric vehicles and parts once the local sourcing takes off. The company, which saw over 13% rise in exports in calendar 2019, is developing a new mass market electric UV for India which will have high local content, said SS Kim, MD &CEO Hyundai Motor India. “HMI’s Chennai plant is the only other Hyundai export hub apart from Korea and is responsible for 100 markets,” he said. “Any electric vehicle that's competitive in India is a candidate for export,” he said. HMI, will follow the same long-term strategy with electric vehicles that it does with gasoline or diesel ones. “We are developing a mass market electric UV for India and we will localise its parts aggressively,” said Kim. “It’s still early stages but once the localisation production and procurement is in place, we will export to other countries. We will export both vehicles and components/parts just like internal combustion engine vehicles. Hyundai exported 1,81,200 units in 2019, the highest in 5 years and has a 26% share of all passenger vehicle exports. India’s overall passenger vehicle exports went up in CY2019 at 7,06,000 units from 7 lakh units in CY2018. Hyundai is targeting upto 1,90,000 units in calendar 2020.

HMI’s exports dipped in 2016 and 2017 due to civil war, political and financial turmoil in a number of Latin American and African markets.

“Things are stable now and there is growing demand from markets like Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Mexico and the growing preference is for mid-size vehicles and SUVs rather than small cars,” said Kim. And while its BS4 stock for India is “under control” it will continue to make BS4 vehicles for export markets. Many export markets have regulations that are less stringent than India. South Africa currently has Euro 3 regulations.

Surat: Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) is undertaking spot surveys in textile markets located on Ring Road from Thursday. These surveys aim at identifying extra elevations in textile structures and encroachments that block entry of fire vehicles into market premises. About 100 textile markets on both sides of Ring Road from Udhna Darwaja to Sahara Darwaja will be covered under the surveys and spot notices to remove obstructions within seven days will be issued to people concerned.

Municipal commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani had issued instructions in this regard on Wednesday.

“In the old textile market area of Ring Road, the issue of elevation and adornment of the structure from outside with combustible material is not a major problem. But narrow roads and encroachments are,” said a civic officer from central zone.

Begumwadi area in old Surat houses at least 50 small and big-sized textile markets with about 30,000 shops. The same number of shops exists in Limbayat zone on Ring Road. Approximately 23 market surveys were carried out in these areas on Thursday.

A SMC executive engineer said, “We surveyed 23 markets today. The issue is no space for entry of fire vehicles due to encroachments of different types. In their attempt to give unique identification to the buildings, people go for outer decoration which blocks release of smoke. In an emergency situation, firefighters are unable to work efficiently because of the smoke.”

SMC teams are likely to complete the surveys in three days and then clear entry and exit gates of encroachments.

Banchhanidhi Pani said, “We will clear all obstructions in the textile markets from a fire point of view. We can’t let some people play with the lives of others. If firefighters are unable to reach a spot on fire, how can you expect them to save lives and properties?”

MUMBAI: Kotak Mahindra Bank has settled its dispute with the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) over dilution of promoter holding. The settlement between the bank and the regulator envisages the promoters getting six months to dilute their holding to 26%, but losing voting rights beyond 15% with effect from April 2020.In a statement to the stock exchanges, Kotak Mahindra Bank said that the RBI had written to the bank on Wednesday, conveying acceptance of a proposal whereby the bank’s promoter Uday Kotak and family, who hold almost 30%, will cap promoter voting rights at 20% of paid-up voting equity share capital until March 31, 2020. From April 1, 2020 onwards, the promoters’ voting rights in the bank will be capped at 15% of equity share capital.Also, once the agreement with the RBI is approved, the promoters will bring down their shareholding to 26% within six months. Given the bank’s current market capitalisation of Rs 3.11 lakh crore, the promoters will have to sell shares worth Rs 12,500 crore. Alternatively, they can issue fresh shares or dilute equity through an acquisition with the resulting share-swap bringing about the dilution.Kotak Bank had filed a writ petition in the Bombay high court opposing RBI’s directive to dilute the promoter stake when it was required to bring down promoter holding from around 30% to 20% by December 2018 and 15% by 2020. Kotak Bank had responded to this directive by issuing Perpetual Non-Convertible Preference (PNCP) shares in August 2019, which brought down the promoter’s holding to 19.7%. The central bank, however, did not approve this, leading to the bank filing a petition against the RBI.As part of the deal with the central bank, the promoters have agreed not to purchase any further ‘paid-up voting equity shares’ of the bank till the percentage of promoters’ shareholding reaches 15%, or such higher percentage as may be permitted by the RBI from time to time.If the laws in future allow it, the promoters will be entitled to purchase paid-up voting equity shares of the bank up to 15% of the equity shares capital or a higher percentage.The bank’s board of directors have resolved to abide by the conditions set by the RBI. In June 2019, the RBI had penalised Kotak Mahindra Bank Rs 2 crore for its failure to adhere to the regulator’ diktat on promoter shareholding.In September 2018, the RBI had frozen the salary of Bandhan Bank CEO C S Ghosh and barred the lender from opening new branches for not adhering to the central bank’s guidelines on diluting promoter stake. According to banking sources, the petition filed by Kotak Bank might have prevented the RBI from imposing similar restrictions on it.Industry sources pointed out that this was the best deal that Kotak Bank could have expected. Had the court judgment gone in favour of the lender, earlier court orders had reaffirmed RBI’s powers to come out with new guidelines.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73787295,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1082794,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/uday-kotak-gets-reprieve-from-rbi-can-hold-26-in-bank/articleshow/73780819.cms

Tej Pratap Yadav at Patna University campus on Thursday.

PATNA: A day after he was expelled from JD (U), poll strategist Prashant Kishor on Thursday found himself caught in a spat between Tej Pratap , Lalu Prasad’s elder son, and RJD’s state president Jagadanand Singh .

It all began when Singh, while speaking to the media, compared Kishor with sewer water. The RJD leader said, “Sewer water is not used at home or in the kitchen.”

Soon after, Tej, who recently posted pictures of him milking a cow, said Kishor welcome to join RJD if he wished to do so. He also cautioned Singh against unparliamentarily language against the former JD (U) leader. He remarked, “He (Jagdanand) is my uncle and a fatherly figure. Hence, I will advise him to work towards strengthening the party rather than publicly abusing someone. This is against Lalu ji’s ideology.”

Asked if his party is divided over Kishor, Tej said, “Jagdanand’s thinking cannot be compared to mine. One thing is certain that my thoughts are similar to those of Lalu ji’s. I follow Lalu ji’s ideology.”

Tej used the occasion to lash out at chief minister Nitish Kumar for “misusing and dumping Kishor”. He said, “He (Nitish) is in the habit of using people and then throwing them out. This is his policy.”

Bihar Congress chief Madan Mohan Jha indicated that his party was not averse to associating with Kishor. This can happen if the party high command wishes, he added.

On the other hand, Kishor said he would make his future plans public in Patna on February 11. Earlier in 2015, Kishor’s political advocacy group, I-PAC, had handled Mahagathbandhan’s campaign in Bihar. At that time, Congress, RJD and JD (U) were part of the alliance. Currently, I-PAC has a fully functional office in Patna.

MUMBAI: Unilever said it has initiated a strategic review of its global tea business. Industry analysts, however, do not expect the Indian subsidiary Hindustan Unilever ( HUL ) to evaluate selling its tea business in India.Tea is part of HUL’s food and refreshments (F&R) portfolio, which contributed about 19% to the company’s 2018-19 revenues (see graphic) of around Rs 38,000 crore. Brooke Bond , a key tea brand of HUL, is an over Rs 2,000-crore brand, and is one of the leading players in India’s beverage category.Other brands include the iconic ‘ Taj Mahal ’ tea under Brooke Bond, which is marketed as a brand closely linked to the heritage culture, while Lipton focuses on emerging consumer tastes such as green tea .With tea in its portfolio, HUL’s connect with consumers goes beyond personal products, opening new opportunities in foods and refreshments in addition to growth in the out-of-home channel. In a statement on Unilever’s fourth quarter and full year performance, CEO Alan Jope said, “We are continuing to evaluate our portfolio and have initiated a strategic review of our global tea business.”Unlike in India, where tea drinking is well entrenched, in the developed markets, black tea is seeing a decline as consumers are said to be moving to other alternatives.Edelweiss Securities said it does not expect HUL to evaluate selling its tea business in India, given that HUL is a market leader and has gained market share over the past few years. “We continue to see HUL being on acquisition mode in India (acquired Indulekha hair oils, Aaditya ice cream, GSK Consumer). In our view, this strategic review of global tea business by Unilever could be possibly for Unilever’s business in some mature markets and for brands like PG Tips,” said Edelweiss Securities research analyst Abneesh Roy.In reply to TOI’s query on the outcome of Unilever’s decision to review its global tea business on India, an HUL spokesperson said, “We have no additional comments to offer since we are in our closed period.” HUL is slated to announce its third quarter results (October-December 2019) on Friday.“We expect HUL to see volume growth of approximately 3% YoY on a high base of 10% YoY (Q2FY20 saw volume growth of 5% YoY on a similar base of 10% YoY),” said Roy. For calendar year 2019, Unilever delivered an underlying sales growth of about 3%, and witnessed growth from emerging markets and its home care unit. Overall growth was lower than the guided range due to the slowdown in the December quarter.While Unilever said India performed well in a slowing market, it added that in the fourth quarter (October-December 2019), price growth decelerated, driven by price reductions in India.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73795679,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-123179,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/unilever-to-review-global-tea-biz/articleshow/73780851.cms

Women select sari at Mahila Udyog Mela in Patna on Thursday.

PATNA: Animal and fisheries resources department secretary N Vijayalakshmi on Thursday encouraged women entrepreneurs in rural areas to learn skills like cattle rearing and fish, poultry and dairy farming.

Addressing the inaugural ceremony of Bihar Mahila Udyog Mela organized by the Bihar Mahila Udyog Sangh (BMUS) at the Planetarium on Thursday, Vijayalakshmi, who is also the managing director of Women Development Corporation (WDC), said the department would soon provide skill development classes on fisheries, poultry and cattle under the Bihar Skill Development Mission.

“The animal husbandry sector is also focusing on generating employment opportunities for women. We can train rural women in such skills and generate employment. As far as the funding is concerned, the WDC will help women get loan for start-ups,” Vijayalakshmi said.

Altogether 70 stalls, including four food stalls, have been put up by women entrepreneurs at Udyog Mela. Many of them have come all the way from Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and other districts of Bihar.

BMUS president Usha Jha said, “Despite the inclement weather in Patna , the footfall of customers was good on Day 1 of the five-day fair. This time, we have two customized stalls of shoes and cakes.”

The items on sale include embroidered suits, ‘Anarkali’ suits, Madhubani paintings, handmade wall hangings, artificial flowers, block-printed garments, ‘papads’, pickle, ‘sattu’, potato chips, sweets, jewellery and other home decor items.

PATNA: Muzaffarpur recorded the poorest air quality in the country on Thursday as the air quality index (AQI) stood at 418. Patna’s AQI, on the other hand, was ranked the fourth worst.

According to a bulletin issued by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the overall AQI of Patna deteriorated from 276 on Wednesday to 305 on Thursday. The AQIs of Muzaffarpur and Gaya were at 418 and 250, respectively.

Track the pollution level in your city

Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) officials claimed that Patna’s overall AQI was the average of the AQIs near the planetarium (404), BIT-Patna (337), Eco Park (280), and S K Memorial Hall (194). The air quality oscillated between 301 and 309 throughout the day as per the data available on ‘Sameer’, a mobile appl that provides hourly updates on the national AQI published by the CPCB.

BSPCB chairman Ashok Ghosh told this newspaper that suspended pollutants from various sources were trapped in the atmosphere due to thermal inversion. “This has lowered vertical wind movement, causing very low dispersion of the pollutants. Hence, the moisture level in the atmosphere has increased. This will continue until the prevailing meteorological condition changes,” he said.

He added, “The AQI can improve only if there is good sunlight and high wind velocity. Light rainfall can, however, further deteriorate the air quality of Patna.”

The Air Quality Early Warning System of the Ministry of Earth Sciences has predicted that the overall AQI of Patna will witness a sharp decline due to climatic conditions.

Ghosh said, “The newly installed continuous ambient air quality-monitoring station at the DRM’s office in Khagaul, which became operational on January 13, is yet to be connected to the CPCB’s server. Two more monitoring stations in Hajipur and Patna City will be operational by the first week of February.”

Fog envelops Patna on Thursday

PATNA: The winter season does not seem to be in a hurry to depart from Bihar as a fresh spell of cloudy and windy weather along with light showers was witnessed at a few places on Thursday. Although weathermen have ruled out the possibility of continuation of showers, mercury is set to plunge from Saturday, following the departure of clouds.

The daily weather bulletin issued by the Patna Meteorological Centre on Thursday evening stated that light rainfall occurred at some places over southwest and south central parts of Bihar like Dehri (1mm), Gaya (0.8mm), Patna (0.3mm) and Muzaffarpur (0.2mm). Besides, moderate to dense fog was observed at few places in the state during the last 24 hours.

The bulletin also stated that the night temperature was likely to fall by two to four notches during the next 48 hours.

“As per the extended weather outlook prepared by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), a rising trend in temperature is expected in Bihar from February 7,” Patna Meteorological Centre director Vivek Sinha told TOI on Thursday.

Asked about the prevailing inclement weather, Sinha said the cloud cover formed due to a western disturbance passing through the region and the skies were likely to be cleared by Saturday.

“Moisture incursion due to the western disturbance and an anti-cyclonic circulation over Jharkhand led to cloudy conditions and showers at a few places. However, the weather system is likely to subside over the next 24 hours. Accordingly, clear skies are expected from Saturday,” he added.

High performance computing facility at CUSB: A high-performance computing (HPC) facility has been set up at the Centre for Environmental Sciences of Central University of South Bihar (CUSB).

“The facility, which has been installed as part of the Climate Modelling Network Programme of the Department of Science and Technology, will be used for weather and climate change research and complex mathematical models,” said CUSB’s public relations officer (PRO) Md Mudassir Alam.

The project at CUSB is being looked after by Pradhan Parth Sarthi, professor of environmental sciences department.

Boatmen on the Hooghly anchor their vessels to the shore as darkness approaches on Thursday afternoon

KOLKATA: A low cumulonimbus cloud plunged the city into near darkness shortly after noon as an upper air trough loomed over Kolkata for several hours on Thursday. Street lights had to be switched on and cars ran with headlights on as visibility dropped.

The darkness persisted for about 10 minutes till the sky opened up and a sharp shower followed. While some parts of Kolkata received a steady drizzle, some areas in Howrah and Hooghly were lashed by a short hailstorm. The Alipore Met office recorded 5.7mm of rain till 5.30pm.

An upper air trough stretching from Haryana to Bangladesh through Uttar Pradesh , Bihar and Gangetic Bengal generated a stream of low clouds that floated into Kolkata around 12.30pm. “They hung low over the city, which led to the darkness. But the rain was light, barring a few places outside the city,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director G K Das.

Other than the thick, low cloud cover, small cloud cells gathered in the sky and moisture kept flowing into south Bengal from the Bay of Bengal. It kept the entire day cloudy. “Cloud convections from Jharkhand hovered above Kolkata, keeping the sunlight blocked for most of the time. This, along with the wind, made the maximum temperature plunge to 22.8°C — four degrees below normal,” said Das. According to him, the maximum temperature will start crawling up from Friday. However, even though Kolkata could be cloudy in the first half of Friday, chances of rain were low.

The cloud cover since Wednesday pulled the mercury up, with the minimum temperature touching 18.8°C on Thursday, four degrees above normal. It could drop by a couple of degrees on Friday and slide further to 13°C-14°C this weekend. “While the minimum temperature could plunge to 16°C on Friday, it could fall by another couple of notches on Saturday. The chill will return once the trough moves away and the cloud cover goes,” said Das.

The airport had been operating without fire NOC since 2005

SURAT: Finally , the Surat international airport has been given no-objection certificate (NOC) by the Surat Municipal Corporation ’s (SMC) fire and emergency department after the Airports Authority of India (AAI) had applied for the NOC.

Since 2005, the Surat airport had been operating without taking the mandatory NOC from the SMC’s fire and emergency department. The issue had come up during the inspection of the warehouse at the domestic cargo terminal by the fire authorities in the first week of December-2019. A diesel pump installed inside the warehouse was found to be in the non-working condition.

The fire department had issued notice to the Surat airport authorities asking them to take the NOC within 15 days. On checking the records, it was found that the airport authorities had not applied for the NOC since 2005.

According to the national fire safety manual, every airport has to take fire NOC from the local civic authorities. However, the Surat airport authorities failed to take the NOC.

Official sources in the SMC’s fire and emergency department said that the fire systems installed at the airport were inspected on January 6, 2020 and that they were found in the working condition. The systems including fire hydrant with hose box and hose reel, fire extinguisher, main fire pump with diesel pump, smoke detector with fire alarm system, sprinkler, under ground water tank and exit were all checked.

SMC chief fire officer Basant Pareek told TOI: “After conducting inspection at the airport, we found all the fire fighting systems in the working condition. Hence, the fire NOC was issued to the Surat airport. The NOC is valid for a period of one year and that the authorities will have to renew it every year.”

Pareek added, “The AAI has its own fire fighting system to deal in the emergency situation. They have got trained staff, equipment, a fire station etc., but the fire NOC is mandatory from the SMC’s fire department. We came to know after checking the records that the airport had not taken NOC since 2005.”

63,['31/01/2020'],PU to develop herbal garden soon,"This story is from January 31, 2020

PATNA: In order to develop 102-year-old Patna University (PU) as a green campus, the authorities have decided to set up a herbal garden at its Saidpur complex and plant saplings of medicinal plants and spices in and around the main campus.

The Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) of PU, at its meeting held here recently under the chairmanship of vice-chancellor Rash Bihari Prasad Singh, also decided to construct a green house as well as a glass house on the campus for developing floriculture on the campus. “The state government has already sanctioned necessary funds for the purpose,” the VC said.

PU is already engaged in preparing a comprehensive directory of plants found on the campus right from Patna Law College to Patna Women’s College soon. This colourful directory would be a souvenir of the university’s centenary celebrations held with much fanfare a couple of years back

PU botany department senior teacher and editor of the directory, Birendra Prasad, told the newspaper that more than 200 varieties of different types of plants are found on the campus. Each of these plants would figure in the directory along with its botanical details, economic importance and medicinal value, if any, and its photograph.

Referring to the proposed herbal garden Prasad said that work of earth filling would be taken up well before the development of garden as Saidpur happens to be low lying area, always obsessed with the acute problem of water logging. After the land filling work is completed, all types of medicinal plants and spices would be transplanted here for the benefit of students as well as research scholars of life sciences, he said.

Medicinal plants available on the campus include ambala (Phyllanththus emblica), arjun (terminalia arjuna), ashok (polyathia longifolia), bael ( age marmelos), bahera (terminalia balerica), laung or clove ( syzygium aromaticum), chandan ( pterocarpus santalinum), dalchini ( cinnamomum cassia), hare ( terminalia chebula), jamun ( syzygium cumin), lasura (cordia myxa), neem ( azadirachta indica), rudraksha ( elaeocarpus granitrus), saptparnee and (alastonia scholaris).

It may be mentioned here that the city of Patna, which once used to be the home for a rich variety of trees, is fast losing its floral wealth, thanks to its unplanned growth in recent years. A good number of rare and beautiful species of plants have either become extinct or are facing extinction in the city.

Even ‘Patli’ trees, after which the city had derived its ancient name ‘Patliputra’, are on the verge of extinction. Only a few species of this tree can be found in the city today, one of them at Patna Museum complex. At least four other plant species, namely Hyphaene Indica, Madhuca Longifalia, Didymocarpus Ladelicate and Tectona Grandis, have already vanished, according to botanists.

Retired professor of botany and old resident of Patna Ajay Kishore Sharan said the city had a rich variety of trees, both long and small, in some cases extending more than 100 feet in height. Most of them were of the flowering kind. But, in recent times, most of them have vanished. The most common trees found in the city today are neem, peepal, mango, bel, red cotton and lebendrum which form over 60% of the total tree population, he said.

PATNA: Several key bridge and road projects are likely to be inaugurated or launched before the state assembly elections to be held around October-November this year.

Road construction minister Nand Kishore Yadav told TOI that a bridge is being constructed by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) as a part of Patna-Ara-Buxar four-lane project and another four-lane bridge connecting Kesariya in East Champaran and Chhapra in Saran district is expected to be thrown open for vehicular movement in two months.

The 1.53km-long bridge parallel to Koilwar bridge over Sone river connecting Patna with Bhojpur is also being constructed with an estimated outlay of over Rs200 crore. “Work on three lanes of the new bridge is in the final stages and is likely to be thrown open for vehicular movement by the end of March,” the minister said.

Koilwar apart, bidding process is also under way for construction of a four-lane bridge parallel to Mahatma Gandhi Setu across the Ganga. The minister said altogether seven big firms have submitted bids for construction of the bridge, which is part of PM Narendra Modi’s special package for Bihar he had announced before the 2015 assembly elections in the state. Its total length from Zero Mile in Patna to Ramashish Chowk in Hajipur is 5.63km and the overall length comprising the approach roads on either side is 14.5km. The bidding process for the project was initiated by the ministry of road, transport and highways in August last year.

Works are also under way for rehabilitation of 38 years’ old Mahatma Gandhi Setu. The rehabilitation work on its western flank is targeted to be completed by March this year. The rehabilitation work on its eastern flank will commence thereafter.

The minister said Digha-AIIMS elevated road in Patna is likely to be ready by March this year. The first 2km from AIIMS-Patna is a two-lane semi-elevated road and the remaining stretch is a four-lane elevated structure.

Chandrapur: Muslim women under the banner of Women Against NRC and Muslim Ekta Manch have geared up for a massive agitation against the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register for Citizens (NRC).

A grand all-women agitation has been planned at Ballarpur SDO office on Friday where protesters will stage daylong sit-in to oppose the allegedly tyrant laws of the central government.

Shakila Parveen, district president of Jamaat-e-Islami’s women’s wing, alleged that the CAA has been brought to “rectify” the failure of NRC in Assam. “There are many burning issues like poverty, unemployment, health and education in the country. At a time when the Centre has failed on all these fronts and country’s GDP has dropped to a record low of 4.7%, the government is busy in pitting one community against other,” said Parveen.

“It is a well-planned conspiracy and the ruling party is sowing seeds of discord among communities for its political gains,” she charged. Parveen also accused the ruling BJP of being inclined to fascism and using Hitler’s tactics to persecute Muslims in India.

Humera Khan from Muslim Ekta Mach informed that over 3,000 women from all major towns in Chandrapur and Gadchiroli districts will gather at Ballarpur and stage the daylong sit-in to oppose the CAA, National Population Register (NRP) and NRC on Friday.

Leaders from various organizations including Bharatiya Muslim Parishad, Jijau Brigade, Shramik Yalgar, Tipu Sultan Foundation, Shaheed Ashfaqulla Khan Foundation and various organizations including Jamat-e-Islami Hind etc have declared their support to the agitation and will address the gathering.

Reeba Zachariah | TNN

Mumbai: After serving as CEO of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) for a decade, Ralf Speth will retire from his current role this September as he turns 65. According to the company’s HR policy, executive directors retire at the age of 65. However, Speth will continue to be on the board of JLR in a non-executive capacity. He will be redesignated as the vice-chairman of the company that accounts for the bulk of parent Tata Motors ’ revenue. According to the company’s HR norms, a non-executive director can remain on the board until the age of 70.

Tata Motors had acquired JLR from Ford Motor Company for $2.3 billion in June 2008 and brought Speth, a German engineer, on board to steer JLR in February 2010. Besides JLR, Speth is a director on the board of Tata Motors and Tata Sons, the promoter of the Indian automotive giant. A search committee has been formed to find the next CEO for JLR, Tata Motors said in a statement.

The Financial Times reported that Denmark national Hanne Sorensen, independent director of Tata Motors, could be a replacement for Speth. This, however, could not be confirmed. Speth, one of the highest paid executives in the Tata Group , has developed JLR from a “niche UK-centric manufacturer to a technological leading, global premium company”.

Rajkot: Overriding their personal grief , the family members of an accident victim of Rajkot decided to donate his organs after doctors declared him brain dead. The family’s noble gesture managed to save three other precious lives.

Virendra Bosamia (64) met with an accident while he was on his way to Jasdan on his bike on January 25. Bosamia was admitted to Wockhardt Hospital in Rajkot where his condition deteriorated and doctors declared brain dead.

Dr Vijay Maniyar of Wockhardt Hospital said that he along with another physician convinced deceased’s son, Chintan, to donate his father’s organs.

“Chintan convinced his grieving family comprising his mother Jyotsana, brother Paras and sister Asha for organ donation. When they agreed, the body was shifted to the Kidney Hospital in Ahmedabad where State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (SOTTO) regional transplant co-ordinator, Dr Divyesh Viroja and Dr Pranjal Modi, completed the transplant procedure,” said Dr Maniyar.

A team of seven doctors carried out the transplant procedures on Bosamia. The deceased’s two kidneys were donated to a 31-year-old woman and a 29-year-old man, while the liver was donated to a 41-year-old man.

“In his death, Bosamia ensured that three others can lead a happy life,” Dr Maniyar added.

NEW DELHI: Police action , or inaction rather, allowed a man to open fire at the protest site in Jamia Millia Islamia and injure a university student. Cameras have caught the cops on Thursday standing idly even as the shooter animatedly waved the pistol and threatened to shoot, some policemen in fact capturing the scene on their mobile phones. Later they were seen making the injured student, Shadab Farooq , jump over the metal barricade when taking him to hospital.Police could have moved swiftly to prevent the youth from firing because he was threatening to do so for over a minute. Instead, the cops stood idly by, their officer in the forefront. Even after the firing, only one policeman stepped forward to nab the shooter, though others joined him later.Police pleaded the suddenness gave them little time to react. “Around 1.30pm, while the protesters were marching, a person burst out of the crowd brandishing a small firearm-like object and within a split second, before anyone could assess or react, fired at the marching students,” said Anil Mittal, Delhi Police additional PRO.Senior officers who have served abroad and have had training exchanges with their western counterparts explained that in incidents like this, the shooter is either tasered or shot in the leg or hand. “If the gunman does not respond to a warning or two, policemen are well within their rights to shoot at him,” a retired officer said. “The videos in circulation show the policemen had ample time to react and grab the youth.”Later, the injured student had to negotiate police barriers when being taken to hospital. Mittal claimed Farooq was lifted over the barricades to save time in accessing medical aid. He added that special commissioners of police Satish Golchha and Praveer Ranjan had met Farooq at the AIIMS Trauma Centre and assured him of all help in recovering from the gunshot.A case for attempt to murder under Section 307 of the IPC has been registered. The Arms Act has also been invoked against the shooter. The Crime Branch is investigating.On several occasions in the past year, Delhi Police has failed to act like a professional police force. The lack of training and discipline was evident in the incident of June 2019 involving tempo driver Sarabjeet Singh, who had taken out a sword to confront the cops. Five policemen responded by hitting the tempo driver and his son with sticks and pistol butts, a few even landing kicks on Singh’s head. On December 15, during the protests at Jamia, a video showed a group of cops dragging a man by his arms even as two women tried to stop them. There was also criticism of excessive police action to quell the protests that day.These incidents have highlighted how the capital’s police force not only lacks non-lethal devices like tasers, but also lacking training in control rogue elements. Plans to procure non-lethal riot control equipment are stuck in paperwork since 2015.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73787338,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1100071,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/suddenness-gave-us-no-time-to-react-say-police/articleshow/73782403.cms

Cops at the crime spot

SURAT: The man involved in the murder of a vegetable vendor in Pandesara was nabbed by police while trying to escape to his native village in Uttar Pradesh on Thursday.

Santosh Prajapati was nabbed when he was on way to his native village near Chitrakoot district. The accused had escaped from the city during early hours of Wednesday after murdering his employer. Cops are likely to arrive in the city with him on Friday. The accused had allegedly killed Premchand Sonkar along with the victim’s wife Sudha. Prajapati and Sudha, who were in an illicit relationship , killed Premchand since he came to know about their affair, police investigation revealed.

Sonkar had employed Prajapati for helping him at his vegetable cart. Prajapati, who lived in neighbouring house, used to visit Premchand’s house frequently and became close to Sudha. There used to be frequent fights between Premchand and his wife over her affair. Prajapati and Sudha planned to murder Premchand and on Wednesday at 1am she opened the door for her paramour to enter the house. Prajapati first strangled Premchand using a rope while Sudha held his hands. Later Prajapati slit the victim’s throat with a knife and also hammered his head to ensure death. The murder was executed in the presence of Premchand and Sudha’s four children aged 11, 8, 5 and 2 years.

Sudha locked her house and went to Prajapati’s with the children. They spent the night there before Prajapati left for his hometown. Sudha returned to her house and sought neighbours’ help to open the door. She told neighbours that robbers had entered her house and killed Sonkar. She told the same thing to police, but her children revealed the truth.

(Representative image)

CHENNAI: High gold prices during October-December quarter of 2019 pushed gold demand to a 8-year-low, when consumption was 194.3 tonnes, data from World Gold Council (WGC) showed.

Traditionally a high-demand period, the quarter which included Diwali and the start of the wedding season, witnessed gold lose its sheen owing to 20% higher prices compared to the previous year.

Jewellery demand stood at 149 tonnes, down 17% from 180 tonnes and the demand for investment dropped by 20%. The data from the council showed that gold demand for calendar year 2019 also fell 9% by volume, because of subdued demand in the second half of the year.

“By volume, India’s annual gold demand was at 690 tonnes — lower than our outlook of 700-800 tonnes — primarily because of a sharp surge in prices of over 20% in H2. Growth in H1 was followed by a sharp drop in Q3. Diwali and Dhanteras revived hopes but the volatility coupled with a higher price bar impacted demand, in the lower and middle price bands,” said PR Somadundaram, managing director India, World Gold Council.

Jewellers witnessed up to a 30% drop in demand on an average in Q4 and was restricted to necessary purchases for weddings and other occasions.

“The demand in the first half was good and since June, when the prices began to shoot up, it dropped and on average in the second half, we saw a 25%-30% drop in demand,” said Anantha Padmanabhan, MD, NAC Jewellers and chairman, All India Gems and Jewellers domestic council.

Looking forward, jewellers are expecting the upcoming budget to reduce import duty on gold from the current 12.5% to at least 10% which would inturn help salvage the demand situation.

“As policy measures unfold, broader economic growth accelerates and local prices of the past 6 months become more acceptable among households, India’s gold demand will be in the range of 700-800 tonnes in 2020,” said Somasundaram.

75,['31/01/2020'],"Brexit will oust 73 members, many of them anti-CAA, from Euro parliament","This story is from January 31, 2020

Brexit kicks in on Friday, with the EU having ratified the UK divorce (AFP)

NEW DELHI: When the European parliament meets again at the end of March to vote on India’s CAA legislation, the 73 British MEPs, many of whom are believed to be behind the numerous resolutions against India, won’t be present. With Brexit kicking in on Friday, all 73 British MEPs would have left. To that extent, the deferment of the vote in the European parliament was a last hurrah that was aborted.

Gaitri Kumar, India’s envoy to Brussels, has met all the groups who have sponsored the drafts in the past couple of days to explain the Indian perspective. Some of the groups have already been convinced of the Indian argument. The resolutions, sources here believe, have been sponsored by Pakistan via some of the British Labour and Liberal Democrat MEPs who belong to groups like S&D and Renew Europe which have sponsored these resolutions.

Foreign minister S Jaishankar will be visiting Brussels in mid-February in preparation for Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s visit there for the India-EU summit on March 13. Some of the European lawmakers said they would wait to get answers from him before voting on the resolution. In addition, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla also wrote to the president of the European Parliament, David Maria Sassoli: ""As members of Inter Parliamentary Union , we should respect sovereign processes of fellow legislatures, especially in democracies.""

However, the issue has not died, merely been kicked down the road. For Pakistan, this exercise keeps the issues in play, particularly because they have been portrayed as being infringement on human rights and Islamophobia.

The Indian defence centered around the argument that the CAA process is internal to India. In addition, it is being debated hotly on the streets, in the states and in the courts. There are 60 petitions pending in Supreme Court against this amendment. The government’s view has been that the entire process would be allowed to run the course of popular and judicial scrutiny. For the European parliament to be passing resolutions on something that is undergoing scrutiny in India, would be disingenuous.

But within the Indian government, certain quarters say the commission and member states should do their bit with their own MEPs, given the extensive briefings etc. that their diplomats have been accorded by the Indian government. Sources said, “As fellow democracies, the EU Parliament should not take actions that call into question the rights and authority of democratically elected legislatures in other regions of the world.” In addition, India said the European countries themselves have set up their own conditions for naturalisation that is dependent on their own context, with their own criteria. India’s context is unique, given the circumstances of its partition and the politico-religious context that exists in this subcontinent. “Every society that fashions a pathway to naturalisation, contemplates both a context and criteria. This is not discrimination. In fact, European societies have followed the same approach.”

76,['31/01/2020'],Partial operations at Porvorim water treatment plant by March,"This story is from January 31, 2020

Representative image

PANAJI: By March 2020, the new 15MLD water treatment plant at Porvorim will be made partly operational, PWD chief engineer Uttam Parsekar told TOI. Porvorim is presently on the tail-end of the Assonora water treatment plant’s distribution network and suffers water shortages quite often. The new plant will cater exclusively to the drinking water requirement of Porvorim, which is witnessing a rapid rise in population density.

“At least part of the new15MLD plant will be ready and operational by March 2020,” Parsekar said.

The plant is being constructed near the cricket stadium in Porvorim.

The water resources department has already laid the raw water supply pipeline up to Porvorim. It means that once work on the plant is completed, increased water supply to Porvorim can begin immediately.

It is expected that at least 5MLD of treated water from the plant will be ready for supply by March 2020, as per instructions given to the contractor.

PWD officials said that areas like Calangute and Candolim also fall at the tail-end of Assonora plant’s distribution line, and thus, supply to these locations is affected.

Once at least 5MLD of the plant becomes operational and supply from the new plant to Porvorim begins, it will reduce pressure on the Assonora plant. This will then enable the Assnora water treatment plant to cater to other stressed areas of Bardez taluka.

After the new 27MLD plant at Opa was commissioned last week, water supply to Panaji, Santa Cruz and parts of Cumbarjua and St Andre constituencies has been enhanced, Parsekar said. The residents of Kadamba Plateau also will receive piped water supply for the first time.

“Water tanks and the pipeline network for Kadamba Plateau are ready. Now, the residents have to apply for water supply connections. We have also issued a public notice to residents across the state asking all those who do not have a water connection to apply for one,” said Parsekar.

79,['31/01/2020'],Single-window &amp; 50-day deemed nod for land reclassification for industries in TN,"This story is from January 31, 2020

Chennai: Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Thursday announced a raft of schemes, including single-window clearance for land use reclassification in non-plan areas with 50-day deemed approval and ‘Direct CTO Scheme’ (consent to operate) for green industries, to promote industrial growth in the state.

Nearly 90% of land in the state falls under the non-plan category, while under reclassification, non-industrial lands are reclassified for industrial use from time to time.

Speaking at the Confederation of Indian Industry’s (CII) 125 years of service to the nation, the CM said approval under single-window clearance for land use reclassification in non-plan areas will be provided within 50 days from the date of submission of applications online. If the approval is not received within the time limit, industries can consider them as ‘deemed approval’ and can go ahead with their project.

Under the scheme, certification of the agricultural department will be done in 30 days, and reclassification of land will be completed within 50 days, the CM said.

The process normally takes six months to two years to be completed.

Typically, planned areas are non-CMDA areas for which the Department of Town and Country Planning has prepared a master plan duly approved by the government. Non-planned areas do not have approved master plan.

In the case of green industries, the CM said, “they can directly pay and apply for ‘consent to establish’ without the need to wait for formal approval and can go ahead with construction of buildings with self-certification.”

Already, white category industries don’t need any approval from the state pollution control board. Now, 63 types of industries coming under the green category, too, will also benefit from the new initiative.

Mostly micro, small and medium scale industries come under the green category.

“These initiatives will give big advantage to industries, with the overall project time line coming down to one year from 2 to 2.5 years, besides risk mitigation and cash flow advantages,” Srinivas Anikipatti, senior director, TN and Kerala, of Knight Frank India (property consultants).

Speaking on how small scale industries and ancillary units of large manufacturing companies will benefit, he said, “In recent times, SIDCO and SIPCOT have not acquired new land parcels to establish industrial parks. So, the ancillary units had to find land in the suburban areas of the city which will mostly be non-planned areas where the conversion (from farm land to industrial land) could take a long time.”

Stressing on the immediate need to play a participative role in shaping the next generation, governor Banwarilal Purohit urged business leaders to sign more MoUs with universities in the state like Anna University. “Even the syllabus must be revised to meet the current demand of skill sets for which business leaders must suggest revision of syllabus,” the governor said.

MIDNAPORE: A couple from Keshpur in West Midnapore have voiced their protest against the National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) and the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) on their wedding card . They plan to theme their wedding around the anti-NRC/CAA movement and spread a message of peace and harmony.

The groom — Md Alif, a graduate in English and a resident of Mugbasan in Keshpur — runs a dealership of kerosene. He will get married to Hasina Mumtaz who is from a neighbouring village on February 27. When they started distributing their wedding cards last week, the one thing that stood out was the message — ‘No NRC, No CAA’ — printed above their names.

“We are getting married at a time when the entire country is protesting against NRC and CAA. I believe that as an Indian, I should also protest against the same. Hence, I designed the wedding card, voicing my protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act. This is my humble contribution to the movement,” said Alif.

Alif said, when he told his parents — Sheikh Yusuf Ali and Marhum Nehura Begum — about his plans for the card, they readily agreed.

“Many of my relatives are unaware of NRC and CAA. So I decided to share the message on the card so that it remains a topic of discussion at the wedding,” he said.

The bench directed the CIC and three other commissioners to file affidavits on or before February 14, indicating the source of powers to constitute a bench of information commissioners and powers to review its own orders.

The petitioner had sought information regarding a work order issued to private persons for the “excavation of forest land” in Mukutban, Yavatmal on May 20, 2013. He did not get any information within 30 days, as per the provision of Section 7(1) of the RTI Act 2005.

After the authorities failed to reply, Satpute filed his first appeal before the appellate authority on October 7, 2013.

The appellate authority did not conduct the hearing within the stipulated time of 30 days and hence, the appellant filed second appeal under Section 19(3) on October 8, 2013 before the state information commissioner (SIC), Nagpur, which was decided on January 16, 2014.

The SIC directed the appellate authority to conduct the hearing and decide the first appeal. The first appellate authority, by its order dated Feb 14, 2014, directed the public information officer (PIO) to furnish the complete information.

The PIO told the petitioner that “no such information is available with him” on February 20, 2014.

Aggrieved by the conduct of the PIO, the petitioner filed another appeal under Section 19(3) before SIC Amravati on March 10, 2014.

The Amravati SIC found that the PIO had violated Section 7(1) and the appellate authority had breached section 19(6) of the Act by failing to give information to the applicant, for which a show-cause notice was issued to them asking “why action should not be initiated against them under Sections 20 (1), 20 (2) of the Act”.

The Amravati SIC found appellate authority PA Dongre guilty of violating the Act, and directed the chief conservator of forests to conduct a departmental enquiry against the appellate authority.

Meanwhile, it was found that the Mumbai CIC had suo moto constituted a division bench of Ajitkumar Jain (SIC at Mumbai) and Thanksi Francis Thekekara (SIC at Konkan), and directed them to review certain decisions.

The petitioner submitted that this division bench arbitrarily reviewed 19 decisions, including that of SIC Amravati, dated October 30, 2015.

The original applicant wasn’t given any hearing opportunity before the order was reviewed on December 17, 2016.

Petitioner’s counsel Tushar Mandlekar argued that SICs do not have any powers under Section 18 to review their own orders and “review” of such decisions of SIC by forming another division bench at Mumbai is absolutely illegal.

Mandlekar told the court the conduct of SIC is arbitrary, illegal, and violative of RTI Act. The constitution of division bench only for the purpose of “review” of a decision of any SIC amounts to action without jurisdiction, he added.

Mandlekar was assisted by Rohan Malviya, while counsel Ambarish Joshi represented the forest department.

MYSURU: Three years after demonetisation , scrapped currency notes of 500 and 1,000 denomination continue to pour into temple donation boxes, including at Chamundeshwari and Srikanteshwara in Nanjangud , some 26km from Mysuru .

Temple functionaries said the hundis are opened once a month and they continue to find bundles of demonetised notes offered by devotees. All the demonetised notes received through hundis are being preserved and government authorities have been informed, they said.

The Srikanteshwara temple received 55 notes of 500 denomination and about eight notes of 1,000 denomination early this week. The Chamundeshwari temple hundi has accumulated invalid notes with a face value of Rs 12,000. Officials said though the notes were scrapped in December 2016, there has been no let-up in the flow to hundis since.

“We have sought the government’s directions on how to dispose of these notes since there is no specific protocol so far,” said Muzrai tahsildar Yathiraj.

“There are 19 hundis in Chamundeshwari temple alone and we continue to receive demonetised notes from all these boxes. Notes with a face value of Rs 15,000 were retrieved earlier,” said Govindraju , an official.

Venkatachalpathy, lead bank manager of Mysuru district, said the notes could be destroyed as they are just bits of paper now. “It is an offence to possess more than two demonetised notes. Banks won’t take the notes either since they are worthless so they can be destroyed,” he said.

Mysuru city corporation

MYSURU: The Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) has decided to cancel the tender of the breakfast scheme for over 2,400 pourakarmikas.

A decision to this effect was taken in the monthly meeting of the MCC held on Thursday evening.

The breakfast scheme for the pourakarmikas was launched in November 2019. A few members raised the issue saying that the quality of breakfast provided to pourakarmikas is very poor. They alleged that it is adversely affecting the health of the civic workers. They urged the MCC to pay the amount in the form of cash directly to all.

Health officer Dr MS Jayanth informed that the food is tested before serving to the pourakarmikas. MCC commissioner Gurudutt Hegde stated that the scheme is implemented as per the directions of the state government and cash cannot be given directly.

After an hour-long discussion mayor Tasleem announced the cancellation of the breakfast scheme. She informed that the matter will be referred to the MCC standing committee on health.

The meeting also approved incentive to the pourakarmikas who worked extra hours as part of the Swatch Sarvekshan 2020.

The meeting also witnessed fierce debate over naming the auditorium inside Subbarao Garden in Nivedita Nagar after KS Rangappa, former VC of the University of Mysore (UoM) and the Karnataka State Open University (KSOU). Congress and BJP members raised objections citing pending FIR and investigations against Rangappa. JD(S) members supported the proposal. Finally it was decided to refer the matter to the mayor.

In the meeting it was announced that former mayor Ayub Khan has been selected as the leader of Congress group while MU Subbaiah selected as the opposition leader in the council.

KOLKATA: It started as a small protest on Bondel Road on Thursday afternoon. By the time it reached Park Circus, the motley group of protesters, including students and homemakers, had swelled to hundreds. The Jamia incident weighed heavily on their minds. The protesters held hands, while raising ‘Azaadi’ slogans and demanded immediate repeal of CAA , NPR and NRC .

Shahzeb Khan, a UPSC aspirant, who was among the protesters, said, “There are so many issues in our country right now such as falling GDP and poor state of economy. Instead of attending to those, the government is busy with something as arbitrary as the NRC and CAA.” “Protests have been going on for almost two months, but the government refuses to listen. And now, they are failing to protect the citizens,” he said, referring to the Jamia Millia shooting incident on Thursday.

International Human Rights Organization working president Wajda Enam Ansari said, “We are not here because we belong to a particular religion. We are here because this is our country. We would have protested even if the discrimination had been against any other religion.” Noorjahan Begum, a third-year commerce student of KK Das College , said there was nothing good about NRC and CAA and the voicer are growing louder.

89,['31/01/2020'],Amaravati rail still a pipe dream as Centre is unlikely to give nod,"This story is from January 31, 2020

Amaravati: The proposed rail project to connect Amaravati is likely to remain a pipe dream thanks to the state government’s decision to set up three capital cities.

The railway board had cleared the project almost two years ago and it is in the final lap of getting the green signal from the Union finance ministry. Now with the state government not keen on achieving the new railway line to Amaravati, the Centre might junk the proposal.

Senior officials in South Central Railway (SCR) are waiting for the outcome of the Union budget to see whether Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman would make any allocation for the project. The FM is slated to present the budget in Parliament on Saturday. The SCR has submitted the first Detailed Project Report (DPR) with an estimate of Rs.2,700 crore for double-line track between Errupalem and Nambur and new tracks between Sattenapalle-Narasaraopet and Amaravati-Pedakurapadu in 2016. The line between Narasaraopet and Sattenapalle would provide direct connectivity to Amaravati with Bangalore. Similarly, Amaravati-Pedakurapadu would connect the capital city with Hyderabad without touching the busiest junctions in Vijayawada and Guntur.

After intense lobbying by the then state government, the Union railway ministry had promised to clear the project, provided the state came forward to share 50% of the project cost. However, the TDP government had refused to take the burden and insisted that the project be sanctioned as the new capital city should have railway connectivity. Instead, the state government promised to provide land free of cost within the capital city area.

Subsequently, the railway board directed the SCR engineering wing to revise estimations to cut down project cost. The SCR readied the second DPR in 2017 which brought down the cost to Rs.1700 crore. Further trimming the project, the railway board gave the nod for laying the new line connecting Amaravati from Guntur and Vijayawada. The new stretch will begin from Errupalem on Vijayawada-Hyderabad section and culminate at Nambur on Guntur-Vijayawada section.

Sources said that Union ministers had promised BJP leaders from the state to clear the new railway line to Amaravati in the upcoming budget. However, the state government’s plan for setting up three capital cities has changed the situation. “It is an open secret that such projects are cleared only under political compulsions. It is doubtful to get the go-ahead from the Centre in the current situation as the state government is not so keen,” said a senior railway official on condition of anonymity.

Interestingly, YSRC parliamentary party leader V Vijayasai Reddy had not mentioned the Amaravati rail project in the wish-list he submitted to the Centre at an all-party meeting held ahead of Parliament session in New Delhi on Thursday.

90,['31/01/2020'],No-violence plea from demonstration platforms,"This story is from January 31, 2020

KOLKATA: CAA protesters in Kolkata condemned Wednesday’s violence in Murshidabad where two people died in a clash and appealed not to identify the widespread protests against the citizenship law with any community or political outfit.

There have been attempts from both sides of the political spectrum to either discredit the protests.

On Wednesday, two groups both of whom oppose CAA but differed on forcing a bandh clashed, killing two persons. “We condemn use of violence in any form. The protests and the movement is not Islamic in nature. Let us unite and rise above communal divide,” said Arshad Parvez Khan, an organizer of a demonstration at Nawab Ali Park in Ekbalpore.

Nousheen Baba Khan, a PhD scholar who is a familiar face at anti CAA protests in the city, too, cautioned against people trying to brand the civil and secular movement as a Muslim one. “CAA and NRC are anti-poor. It cannot be associated with any one community. In Assam, more Hindus are suffering than Muslims,” Khan said. “I condemn those trying to spread Islamophobia under the garb of nationalism. I also want to caution some Muslims who are putting out statements that are making the community a target for bigots. Both are fringe groups and have no space in our secular movement,” he said.

People from all communities, including Sikhs, Christians and Hindus, have also staged series of protests against CAA in the city. “The anti-CAA protests have brought together all the citizens who feel the secular fabric of the country is under threat and the rights guaranteed by the Constitution are being violated. It will be unfair to identify it with any particular community,” said Sneha Sarkar , a college student who is a regular at the demonstrations at Park Circus and Hogg Street.

Religious figures have also urged people to protest peacefully and co-operate with law enforcing agencies.

“The two deaths in Murshidabad is very sad. We are protesting against an authoritarian and barbaric regime. The protesters must be united and not walk into traps of those wanting to derail the movement,” said Mohammad Yaqub, a cleric in central Kolkata.

AHMEDABAD: In what seems a well-planned operation, two persons on a bike snatched a bag containing 3kg gold jewellery worth Rs 1.02 crore from a salesman near Khodiyar Mandir in Nikol on Thursday, at about 4pm. Police said four salesmen from Vikas Jewellers, CG Road had come to display their ware to Kalpesh Modi, the owner of Vaibhav Laxmi Gold in Nikol.When the salesmen were exiting the shop and about to sit in their car, a bike came speeding from the direction of the highway.

92,['31/01/2020'],Goa: Rs 40 crore pending VAT refunds take toll on small businesses,"This story is from January 31, 2020

Representative image

PANAJI: Two-and-a-half years after the goods and services tax ( GST ) system was rolled out across the country and value added tax (VAT) was phased out, refunds of the previous tax regime to the tune of Rs 40-50 crore remain pending with the commercial taxes department, sources said.

Small businesses are facing a liquidity crunch at a time when they are looking for working capital. With sectoral credit drying up and GST refunds also delayed by 30-45 days, industrial units want the state government to clear the backlog.

“VAT refund for 2016-17 are piled up, for some companies it is around Rs 5 crore,” said a local industrialist, who chose to remain anonymous.

Some industrial units are also facing an issue in getting a refund for the input tax credit for the financial year 2017-18. During the transition from VAT to GST, input tax credit was allowed to be utilised as input tax credit under GST transition provisions. Tax payers with excess input VAT credit over output credit for previous financial years were supposed to apply for VAT refund.

“VAT refunds for various assesses are still pending with the department due to delay in assessment or clearance of refund voucher. This creates undue hardships and needs to be resolved immediately,” said Confederation of Indian Industry–Goa chairman Lalit Saraswat.

Officials with the department of commercial taxes said that the pending dues will be cleared before March 31, by when the limitation period for dues ends.

“The claims have to be verified minutely. There are multiple stages of assessment and verification,” commissioner of commercial taxes Deepak Bandekar said.

President Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry Manoj Caculo said a scheme to settle pending cases under the Goa VAT Act would reduce litigation, bring revenue to the state, and allow authorities to focus on GST implementation.

Micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and traders find themselves squeezed from all sides as banks refuse to lend and GST payments are delayed, industrialists said.

“As the payments are blocked for more than six months, the MSMEs go in red and default on repayments and are classified as defaulters,” chairman, MSME at Assocham National Council, Manguirish Pai Raikar said.

Students argued that as per the statues, the academic council did not have two student representatives and that such rules cannot be imposed after the commencement of the semester. “The rules cannot be implemented if they are not mentioned in the prospectus,” stated a statement issued by the EFLU students union 2019-20 against the circular issued by the in-charge registrar.

Before boycotting the classes, the students held an emergency meeting on Tuesday late night to discuss possible plans of action regarding the circular. The students continued the protest till late Wednesday evening.

AHMEDABAD: Ghatlodia police on Thursday arrested three men, all aged around 25, who allegedly posed as crime branch cops and abducted two 19-year-old men, accusing them of being drug addicts and extorting money from them.

It later turned out that the accusers were themselves were addicted to ganja and were trying to get money to get their fix of the drug.

The accused were identified as Sahil Rabari, Harsh Barot and Sahil Rathod, all residents of Sola.

In his FIR at Ghatlodia police station, Naitik Arya, who works for a private firm, said that he and his friend Urvish Chunawala were sitting at the Sola Road AMTS bus stand late on Monday evening.

At around 5.50pm on Monday, two men, later identified as Rabari and Barot, arrived in a car and asked them why they were sitting there. “They rushed to us and asked us if we were smoking and selling ganja. They began assaulting us and pushed into the car,” Arya stated in his FIR.

The duo took Arya and Chunawala to a place nearby, where one of them said that some senior crime branch officials were coming to see them and they would decide whether a complaint would be filed against them.

After a while, the third accused arrived and that he was a crime branch official, but Arya identified the third man as Rathod, who he knew. On hearing this, the three began beating Arya and Chunawala and began demanding Rs 50,000. When they were being beaten, Rathod said he had some work at the jail and left.

Rabari and Barot then took Arya and Chunawala to another place in their car and started beating them with sticks. Rabari and Barot then snatched Arya and Chunawala’s mobile phones and took Rs 500 from them.

Arya and Chunawala managed to get away from their attackers and get home. They later filed a complaint with Ghatlodia police and the accused were arrested on Thursday evening.

Inspector Pushpa Gamit of Ghatlodia police said the accused are addicted to ganja and that was why they abducted and robbed the two men.

JAIPUR: A division bench of Rajasthan High Court on Thursday said that fixing the venue of matches of Rajasthan Royals outside Jaipur is subject to the outcome of writ petition. The court has also granted time to Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI), Rajasthan Royals, Rajasthan Sports Council and Rajasthan Cricket Association to file a reply within a week. The court has fixed February 13 to be the next date of hearing.

The bench comprising Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Ashok Gaur gave these orders while hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the high court challenging the decision of BCCI to shift to IPL matches of Rajasthan Royals from Jaipur to Guwahati.

“We have said in the court that IPL matches benefit the state at large as the state collects big revenue. These matches in Jaipur also generate employment and most importantly benefit the local cricketing talent. Thus, there is no point in shifting the matches from Jaipur to Guwahati,” said Vimal Chaudhary , counsel for the petitioner.

During the hearing, it was further said that by additional advocate general (AAG), Satendra Raghav that the government is ready to provide all the facilities for conducting IPL matches in the state. “Apart from SMS Stadium, matches can also be held at Jodhpur and Udaipur Stadium,” he added. While the Sports Council said that on every IPL match played at the SMS Stadium, the council gets 20 lakh rupees per match, which will is utilized for the benefit of the budding young crickets.

Prateek Kasliwal, counsel for RCA, said, “We are well-prepared to organize these matches. We get Rs 60 lakh per match including Rs 30 lakh from BCCI and Rs 30 lakh from Rajasthan Royals. There is no point in shifting these two matches elsewhere in the country.”

On the other hand, BCCI said that under the 2019 IPL rules, three matches of a home team can be organised away from the home ground.

Rajasthan Royals informed the court that they will get extra earning if the matches are organised away from Jaipur. Responding to this the court said the extra earning makes no difference. “Matches are not just to earn money.

Few Indian students stuck in China after Coronavirus struck the country

For Indian and foreign students in China’s Wuhan city, the Chinese New Year is one of the most anticipated annual events. This is the time when they come home for vacation.

But this year, with Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, becoming the epicentre of the deadly coronavirus outbreak, the over 500-strong Indian student community, most of them studying medicine, in various universities are facing an unprecedented crisis.

While those who are stuck in Wuhan are living in fear of contracting the deadly virus and are confined to their rooms with no contact with other students, the many who have come home are clueless of when they can return to China.

I was among the few fortunate Indians who left Wuhan and reached home in Jaipur just before the mortalities from the outbreak began to mount and the news hit international headlines.

The news of some ‘virus’ causing cold, cough, sneezing and breathing problems had started circulating among local residents in Wuhan and in the media during the last days of December. Nobody had then anticipated that it would be so deadly, and that life would come to standstill in a few weeks.

In the first week of January, people wearing masks could be seen visible on the streets. However, I didn’t observe any major concerns and normal crowds were seen on the streets and malls.

Since January 25 is the New Year (Spring Festival), the biggest festival for Chinese, streets were decked up with traditional festival lanterns and paintings. The excitement was palpable in the air. The situation started to look grim from the second week of January as more number of infected cases were confirmed with coronavirus.

Soon, Thailand and Singapore reported cases from among travellers arriving from China. That was when I came to fully ‘understand’ the deadly virus. The news was enough to alarm local residents, expats as well as international students.

While those who could started leaving the city, foreign students, who had planned to go home in mid-January, preponed their journeys. Those who had planned to stay back during the vacation, began preparing to leave as early as possible. On January 7, a few days before the outbreak became a full-fledged crisis, I left Wuhan for India.

It was later reported in the media that one of the sources of coronavirus was believed to be a local seafood market, which is about 30 minutes from where I live in Wuhan. Looking back, I can only count my blessings.

Since then, I have been in constant touch with both my Indian and foreign friends who are still stuck there. The epidemic has resulted in the virtual lock-down of the city. All transportation systems have been suspended from January 23.

The shutdown has created panic among the student community. Students have been asked to stay inside their room sand instructed to avoid any physical contact or visiting rooms of fellow students. An Indian PhD student from my university described the situation as unprecedented and said that staying inside the rooms was taking a toll on the mental health of students.

“I have not gone outside for the past one week. Physically it is tiring and psychologically I am exhausted. There’s the constant fear of getting infected and nobody has any idea of what to do in this situation. In addition, family members are also worried, and my mother starts crying whenever I call her,” he said.

Most of the complaints that are being shared in various WeChat groups revolve around unavailability of food, face masks and sanitisers and disinfectants. Stores open for a few hours and run out of goods. One classmate said that the situation was “so grim that food and other grocery are almost over. I am surviving on packed noodles and even that will soon run out of stock”.

While the university has deployed staff to calm down and direct students on taking proper care and sending regular updates on where they can avail grocery, a sense of confusion still prevails.

Meanwhile, the whole of Wuhan city with a population of nearly 10 million has turned into a ghost town. Amidst the chaos, the Indian embassy in China has created a coordination group on WeChat and is working on finalising the dates and logistics for evacuating Indian nationals from the province.

As per latest information posted by officials on the group, they have asked students to confirm their willingness in writing to be evacuated. The embassy will then inform them about the dates and process of evacuation. Almost all are waiting to be airlifted to home quickly.

Vijayawada: A second year student at a private-run B Pharmacy college committed suicide by hanging herself at her hostel in Nuzvid on Thursday.

According to Nuzvid police, fellow students found the 20-year-old girl found dead in the morning.

The police said that the girl is from Vijayawada and left a suicide note behind requesting her parents not to demand an inquiry into her suicide.

The police suspect that a failed love affair might be the trigger for the suicide. In her suicide letter, the girl sought forgiveness from her parents, her younger and elder sisters.

The suicide note said she was battling depression. “Please don’t inquire into my death. Both my parents took care of me very well. I miss you all,” the letter read. The police registered a case under Section 174 of CrPC (death due to hanging) at Nuzvid police station. The police have sent the body to a local government hospital for post-mortem.

Representative image

JAIPUR: A division bench of Rajasthan High Court on Thursday said that fixing the venue of matches of Rajasthan Royals outside Jaipur is subject to the outcome of writ petition. The court has also granted time to Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI), Rajasthan Royals, Rajasthan Sports Council and Rajasthan Cricket Association to file a reply within a week. The court has fixed February 13 to be the next date of hearing.

The bench comprising Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Ashok Gaur gave these orders while hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the high court challenging the decision of BCCI to shift to IPL matches of Rajasthan Royals from Jaipur to Guwahati.

“We have said in the court that IPL matches benefit the state at large as the state collects big revenue. These matches in Jaipur also generate employment and most importantly benefit the local cricketing talent. Thus, there is no point in shifting the matches from Jaipur to Guwahati,” said Vimal Chaudhary , counsel for the petitioner.

During the hearing, it was further said that by additional advocate general (AAG), Satendra Raghav that the government is ready to provide all the facilities for conducting IPL matches in the state. “Apart from SMS Stadium, matches can also be held at Jodhpur and Udaipur Stadium,” he added. While the Sports Council said that on every IPL match played at the SMS Stadium, the council gets 20 lakh rupees per match, which will is utilized for the benefit of the budding young crickets.

Prateek Kasliwal, counsel for RCA, said, “We are well-prepared to organize these matches. We get Rs 60 lakh per match including Rs 30 lakh from BCCI and Rs 30 lakh from Rajasthan Royals. There is no point in shifting these two matches elsewhere in the country.”

On the other hand, BCCI said that under the 2019 IPL rules, three matches of a home team can be organised away from the home ground.

Rajasthan Royals informed the court that they will get extra earning if the matches are organised away from Jaipur. Responding to this the court said the extra earning makes no difference. “Matches are not just to earn money. Since Rajasthan and Royals are the names associated with Rajasthan and Jaipur, it is not appropriate to take two matches away as people’s sentiments are also associated,” the court said in verbal remarks.

Thiruvananthapuram: It appears that the meeting conducted by state police chief Loknath Behera in November last year to address road traffic-related concerns of city residents was not merely a publicity stunt. It has been learned that the police have taken serious note of the problems highlighted by the residents and have even forwarded these complaints to officials of departments concerned to rectify the problems related to road infrastructure.

The police authorities have also served them notices stating that the failure to carry out the works in a time-bound manner will result in legal action. This move came after the tragic death of a 23-year-old two-wheeler rider, who fell into a pothole and was run over by a truck near Palarivattom metro station in Kochi recently.

A senior official of the state road fund board confirmed receiving the notice early this month and said that they have already begun relaying works of pothole filled roads in the city.

“Around 15km of roads in the city are full of potholes and had failed miserably in the bump integrator (BI) test to measure the unevenness of road surfaces,” said an official.

Even if the police had not served the notices, we would have carried out the works anyway. The department was waiting for the rains to end. It was just coincidence that the launch of works happened at the same time the police served the notice, the officer said adding that the ongoing relaying works will be completed by March. Then, they will commence the works on road signs and markings, the lack of which was causing numerous accidents at busy junctions as highlighted by the city residents.

Besides the KRFB, notices were also served to the public works department and Thiruvananthapuram road development company ltd. Keltron was also served a notice to look into the faulty traffic signal lights in the city. On January 17, the works were reviewed in a meeting of the traffic advisory committee chaired by the city corporation mayor in which senior officials of the city traffic police and other departments attended.

Assistant commissioner (city traffic, south) M K Zulfiquer said that the police had prepared a list of spots that needed maintenance, categorized them according to the agencies or departments responsible and then handed out the lists accordingly. A deadline of three months was given, which ends on March 30. So far, only KRFB has replied to the notice on record, agreeing to finish the works in the allotted time.

State police chief Loknath Behera had convened a meeting with the city residents after long traffic snarls became a regular affair on various roads in the city. Besides this, the city also has a high accident rate. Recently, National Road Transport Planning and Research Centre (NATPAC) too had released the results of a survey conducted based on accident data for the year 2018, which revealed that the capital city had the highest number of high-priority accident-prone stretches in the state.

Varanasi: A high drama was created at Gyanvapi entry point of Kashi Vishwanath Dham (corridor) when the organisers of annual Sri Ramcharit Manas Navahan Parayan Gyan Yajna staged a sit in after the security personnel denied entry to the articles sent for the event to Kashi Vishwanath-Gyanvapi complex on Thursday morning.

They even threatened to hold the event on road. The event is commencing from Saturday.

The issue was settled after the KV temples chief executive officer Vishal Singh proposed to hold the event at Nandi Hall this year. The organisers agreed to it and called off the stir.

The organisers had sent tent and other decoration items for nine-day Ramcharit Manas recital and discourse on Wednesday night. However, the security personnel at Gyanvapi entry point of the corridor stopped the articles outside Gyanvapi entry point.

On Thursday morning, officer bearers of the organising committee, including Suryalal Vyas, reached there and informed the security personnel that they had permission for the event but the security officials denied having any such information.

Vyas accused the temple administration of creating hurdles in the six-decade old traditional event from past many years and warned to hold the event outside Gyanvapi entry point if they were not allowed to enter the premises.

Later, temple CEO reached there and proposed Nandi Hall as the venue for holding their annual event this year as the the one they sought was not available due to disturbance caused by the ongoing construction work of KV Dham project.

Additional sessions judge P M Unadkat refused to grant any legal protection to Patel with the observation that his custodial interrogation is required to elicit information regarding the arrangement of the mammoth rally, to find out who other accused are in the offence etc., said public prosecutor Sudhir Brahmbhatt , who had vehemently opposed the anticipatory bail plea.

The Vastrapur police lodged an FIR for the violence that broke out in the evening after Patel addressed the Patidar rally and then sat on fast to push the demand for reservation for the community. The FIR was filed for rioting, unlawful assembly, deterring cops from performing their duty and causing damage to property. The government objected to Patel’s plea by stating that Patel and others violated the police commissioner’s notification by continuing their programme even after 5pm on August 25, 2015, when they were supposed to finish their meeting.

Patel sought anticipatory bail in the 2015 case after non-bailable warrants were issued against him by various courts and he was arrested in three different cases for bail condition violation. The courts had issued warrants on complaints made by the government.

Despite a sunny afternoon, windy cold conditions prevailed in the afternoon with a maximum temperature of 21.6°C recorded, almost 2 degrees below the normal notch.

Aurobindo Pharma also said it will work closely with the regulator to comprehensively address the issues.

Gutta Jwala

GUNTUR: Veteran badminton player Gutta Jwala has asked students to keep in mind that only sportspersons can become world champions. She said that ignoring sports and games would cost them dearly in the future.

Jwala was addressing students at Vignan Mahotsav, a mega sports and cultural event at Vignan University near here on Thursday. The campus teemed with thousands of students who arrived here to take part in different sports, cultural and academic competitions.

Addressing the students, Jwala said sports and games would also keep young brains fit to take up global challenges. She asked students to concentrate on physical fitness along with studies. She asked students not to confine themselves to the four walls of the classrooms if they really wanted to become tomorrow’s champions.

Chief executive officer of ITC Agro Business Division , Sanjeev Rangrass said there was no substitute to hard work to realise goals. He asked the students to take failures as stepping stones for success and keep learning till they achieved better results. He said every student should introspect whether they deserve the success they have achieved and improve it further by hard work. Vignan Educational Institutions group chairman Dr Lavu Rathaiah said students should not miss physical fitness schedules for any reason. He said keeping fit was key to achieving success and that Vignan University had launched credits for physical fitness to keep students ahead of others. He said they have been organising Vignan Mahotsav for the 16 years to encourage youth to take extra-curricular activities seriously.

He said Vignan University believed that holistic development of students was possible only by allowing them to take part in sports and cultural activities. Participation in inter-university, inter-collegiate competitions will help students become true leaders as they would learn many things, he said.

JAIPUR: The Jaipur airport slips to 89th position in the Airport Service Quality (ASQ) survey done by Airport Council International (ACI) for fourth quarter (October 2019 to December 2019). In the third quarter, Jaipur airport was at 63th position.

The constant increase of passengers, construction works have led to the degradation in the facilities which resulted in the slide of ranking.

In 2017, Jaipur airport ranked number 1 in the ASQ survey but with the constant increase in passengers and increase in frequency of the flights the service has badly affected in past three years.

TOI got the copy of the survey released on Thursday evening.

“The survey is done once in every three months to check the quality of services given to the passengers at the airports across the country. The results are really shocking for us,” said a senior officer of airport authority of India, Jaipur on the condition of anonymity.

Jaipur Airport was voted the number 1 airport in the world in the 2017 survey in the 2.5 million passengers per year. “Till December 2019, Jaipur airport had handled nearly 4.75 lakh passengers,” said an officer.

Ranchi airport has been on the top among 24 airports across the country, while Lucknow at number two and Trivandrum Airport at number three. “Some of the airports that are ahead of Jaipur are Ranchi (1), Lucknow (2), Trivandrum (3), Ahmedabad (4), Calicut(5), Indore (6), Varanasi (7) and others,” said an officer.

Airport Authority of India (AAI), Jaipur director Jaideep Singh Balhara said, “In past three months, we have undertaken many construction works to facilitate the passengers which could be the reason why in the fourth quarter our results are not satisfactory. However, with the new facilities, including new arrival and departure gates, we will certainly come up in the survey for 2020 and its quarters.”

This survey of airport service quality was conducted on 33 standards related to passengers.

In the survey, feedback is taken at every point from the time passengers enter the airport to the inside of the plane. At the same time, information is taken on all points till the time of arrival by airplane, collecting baggage, catching taxi and departure.

During the survey, eight standards were found at Jaipur airport, were bad. Passengers have completely rejected the facilities of Jaipur airport administration on these standards.

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Thursday stayed the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) from taking any action against 480 ceramics units in the Morbi-Wankaner cluster, who were ordered to pay a fine of Rs 5,000 for every day since their establishment for causing environmental damage.

The GPCB issued notices to 600 ceramic units for continuing to use coal gasifiers despite a strict ‘no’ from the National Green Tribunal and the Gujarat high court in March and November 2019, respectively. The GPCB cited a report by a committee set up by the NGT, which held ceramics units responsible for violation of pollution rules and recommended a penalty of Rs 5,000 for every day since the day GPCB gave its consent for the establishment of that particular unit.

GPCB had issued notices in September, to which the ceramics units filed replies. However, the board issued final notices in the last two months to some 600 units, holding them at default with judicial orders to do away with gasifiers. The notice was for a fine for interim environmental damages, computed at Rs 5,000 per day, or Rs 18.25 lakh per year. Most ceramics units have been functioning for more than five years. They were given 15 days to deposit the fines, which run into more than Rs 500 crore.

GPCB said that in case of failure to pay the fines, it would decide on further more stringent action without providing a hearing opportunity to the ceramics units, for breaching various provisions of the Water Act and the Air Act, which include punishment with imprisonment for a term not less than one year and six months and which could extend to six years, besides fines.

On Thursday, 480 units approached the high court through advocate Pritesh Khambholja and challenged the notices demanding the massive fines. It was submitted that GPCB did not grant them a hearing against the final notice, which is against the principle of natural justice.

After a preliminary hearing, the bench of Justice Harsha Devani and Justice Sangeeta Vishen issued notices to GPCB, the state government and the Centre, and directed the authorities “not to take any coercive steps pursuant to the impugned legal notices/orders”.

Hyderabad: In a bid to ensure deeper penetration of microinsurance in the country, the committee on microinsurance, which has submitted its report to the insurance regulator IRDAI, has rooted for offering customers more flexibility in paying premium, be it on a daily, fortnightly or even monthly and quarterly basis.

“There should be an option to pay single premium in daily / fortnightly / monthly / quarterly instalments. Customers should be allowed to pay mortality premium in lump sum with remaining premiums to be allowed to be paid in instalment,” the committee has recommended.

The committee highlighted the importance of keeping the policy simple and comprehensible for customers as that would give them confidence to opt for it. “Product benefits should be simple so that they could be easily conveyed by the distributor and understood by the customer,” it said. Besides, it added that a simple one-page proposal form and digital policy document should be applicable for all insurers.

The committee was of the view that the pricing of microinsurance products can be reduced by several ways, such as reduction in reserve requirement even for a short duration can help in better pricing. It also said that there is a requirement of waiver of stamp duty on microinsurance products.

On the distribution front, it said that cooperatives or self-help groups can be made partners in providing insurance solutions as it will improve penetration of microinsurance products. The panel said the microinsurance (MI) agent should have flexibility to distribute products of more than one insurance company like a corporate agency and more entities should be included under the definition of MI agents. The function of policy issuance using customized IT applications should be outsourced to MI intermediaries who have the necessary human and physical infrastructure, it said.

It further said that the claim pay-out can be linked to the goal of the target segment. For example, if they are saving for the child, the claim pay-out should be linked to the school fee of their kids.

Microinsurance is specifically targeted at low-income populations, with affordable insurance products to help them cope with and recover from financial losses. In India, around 29.5% of the total population (36 crore) lives below the poverty line, of which 10.2 crore people live in urban areas while 25.8 crore live in rural areas.

Ch Kaseem

HYDERABAD: The Telangana police have informed the high court that Maoists were using pretty good privacy (PGP) encryption to store their data and even forensic experts were finding it difficult to crack it. Police stated this in their affidavit filed in Osmania University associate professor Ch Kaseem ’s detention case.

“We seize several hard disks and electronic devices during our search operations at places belonging to Maoists, but since they are using the PGP encryption, we are finding it difficult to decode the material retrieved from these devices,” assistant commissioner of police, Gajwel, P Narayana said in the affidavit filed before the court. He also explained the cases and details of FIRs against Kaseem. He (Kaseem) was asking people to revolt against the state, the affidavit added.

The ACP filed the counter on the direction of a bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy, which was hearing a plea that challenged the detention of Kaseem. As police were linking Kaseem with Maoists, the CJ sought evidence.

Narayana, in his counter, narrated about how the Maoists believe in Mao Tse Tsung and his philosophy that “political power flows through the barrel of the gun"". They have three magic weapons the party, the people's army and the united front, the ACP explained. They have mass organisations to prepare people for the final revolution, he added.

“Constitutional governance in Telangana was brought to a standstill for nearly three decades by Maoists,” he said.

“They posed the highest threat to the sinternal security and the state faced a lot of problems in fighting the Maoists’ unconventional guerilla warfare. They committed 12,612 incidents in Telangana and killed 2,182 civilians, 370 public representatives, including a state minister, a former speaker, and two legislators, 404 police personnel, including 3 IPS officers,” the ACP said.

HYDERABAD: Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have decided to mutually resolve pending issues pertaining to Schedule IX and X institutions listed in the AP Reorganisation Act , 2014 soon.

The two states are at loggerheads over distribution of assets and liabilities of the 91 institutions under Schedule IX for the past six years.

Telangana chief secretary Somesh Kumar and his AP counterpart Neelam Sawhney met on Thursday on the pending bifurcation issues between the two states. AP claimed that it has no disputes over bifurcation of 53 institutions, while Telangana reportedly said it has no problem over 68 institutions. Both the states have reservations over distribution of assets and liabilities of RTC, power utilities and some organisations.

The chief secretaries also discussed about the bifurcation of power utilities employees, which even went up to the Supreme Court. However, no decision was taken on the issue.

Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and his Andhra counterpart YS Jaganmohan Reddy , who had met earlier this month, directed their officers to hold a joint meeting on resolving pending issues. Officials said the meeting was held in a very positive manner and decided to continue the dialogue further and brief their respective CMs on the issues.

The picture of Nakoda Bhairav on the chair of sarpanch in Sirohi

JAIPUR: Rejecting the superstitious tag attached to him, Ajabaram Chaudhary, who became sarpanch from Reodar gram panchayat in Sirohi district , placed the photo of Nakoda Bhairav , the God he worships, on the chair of the sarpanch and has vowed to work for the people sitting on the ground, which he believes would put him on an equal footing with the people of the village.

Chaudhary believes that ""greed for power and the urge to cling to one's chair"" would make a person egoistic and, therefore, he would avoid sitting on the chair. Chaudhary, who was elected sarpanch in the second phase of panchayat polls held on January 22, took charge on January 25.

""When I was campainging in the villages, I had vowed not to sit on the sarpanch's chair after getting elected. Therefore, I decided to sit on the ground for the next five years and work for the people of the village. This would put me on an equal footing with the people of village,"" Chaudhary told TOI.

""Moreover, I am a believer and devotee of Nakoda Bhairavji. That's why I have placed the photo of God on Sapanch's chair and would remain seated there for 5 years. I want to avoid sitting on the chair as it makes a person egoistic and he/she hardly focuses on developmental works,"" he added.

133,['31/01/2020'],"States can express opinion, can’t oppose NPR: Nalsar vice-chancellor","This story is from January 31, 2020

HYDERABAD: Vice-chancellor of National Academy of Legal Studies and Research ( Nalsar ), Hyderabad, Faizan Mustafa tells Sribala Vadlapatla that citizenship is not just about borders, it is about membership to a political community adhering to the same values. CAA , NPR and NRC are opposed because they are in violation of the constitutional spirit. As these subjects are enshrined in central list of legislation, states can only say that their legislative powers are being limited.

Can the states who are opposing the NPR stop its implementation?

No way, because subjects like NPR and citizenship are in the central list of the enacting legislation. States may express their political opinion, at the same time they are implementing agencies for NPR and Census. As per the legislation, if states refuse to implement it, or if there is any disturbance, the Centre can impose presidential rule. Centre cannot do this through an app, it must depend on states. This again is a political decision. Even on the subjects which are in the concurrent list, when state and Centre legislate on the same subject, the central legislation prevails over state legislation.

There is debate that NPR and NRC are the same, what is your take on this?

If Census and NPR are the same, as some politicians have claimed, then why did the central government make huge allocations separately for both Census and NPR? The Vajpayee government made some changes through rules in the Citizenship Act. Frequent amendments are confusing the people. When the first NPR was done during the Congress regime, there was no problem in the question format. The eight additional documents said to be added in the present NPR are a cause of concern. Yes, NPR is very much a subset of NRC. The list prepared in NPR will be noted in NRC. Anyone who is listed to be suspicious, will not make it to the NRC.

The Centre has said that there is no need to show documents for NPR.

They may not ask for the documents but asking for Aadhaar number or PAN number is the same as asking for documents. The Supreme Court has said don’t link Aadhaar with any scheme, but in reality, what is happening is that the government uses Aadhaar for everything. The same will be the case with NPR or at least that is the apprehension of many. The fear is that such documents or information needed may not be available, which ultimately will lead to loss of citizenship. The arbitrary power of lower rank officials who will visit our houses to decide on our citizenship should be questioned.

Has any other country conducted an NRC-like exercise?

No, no country has conducted a similar exercise with such a large population. Most states give national identity cards. Take NRC in Assam. It was the Hindu population that was impacted. Those who submitted documents and became part of NRC, have not been given any identity cards so far. So, what is its purpose?

Do you think CAA is a constitutionally valid law and can the state approach courts against it?

Citizenship is not a concept confined to borders or geographical area. It is basically membership to a political community. States can challenge it (CAA), but the Supreme Court goes by the narrowed down technical grounds to give judgement and it will be passed. What the Kerala chief minister said was his political intention, but the central Act will prevail. States can only object. In such cases, their legislative powers will be questioned. But this is an unprecedented scenario. CAA is being opposed by many because it is violative of basic principles of the Constitution. In fact, there was discussion in the constituent assembly at that time whether all Hindus across the world who are stateless, should be given Indian citizenship, but the idea was rejected. Today, minorities living in the countries in India’s neighbourhood are not stateless. Then why are we conferring citizenship on them is also one argument.

What are other major objections to CAA ?

There is no consensus on this Act itself is the proof that it is violation of constitutional spirit. The minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghan are allowed. There are hardly minorities in Afghanistan. In that case, Sri Lanka should have been part of CAA as there are many Tamil Hindus who want to settle in India. Despite Pakistan and Bangladesh being Muslim countries, religion is not a criteria for getting citizenship there. Afghanistan is much more advanced than us in framing citizenship rules in 1922. I guess here the chronology of intended actions was not right. They should have done NPR, NRC and then CAA.

The announcement was made by the president of the Secunderabad Cantonment Board, Brigadier Abhijit Chandra, in response to a letter from S Ravindra Babu, a resident of Ward 5.

Brigadier Chandra also said that financially the Secunderabad Cantonment Board was not in a good position and was barely able to provide residents with basic civic amenities.

Speaking to TOI, S Ravindra Babu said, “While the photo electoral rolls are being implemented by the Election Commisison for both State Assembly and Lok Sabha elections, why can’t the Ministry of Defence (MoD) impelement it for Cantonment Board elections?”

Adding that duplicate votes could be weeded out using photo electoral rolls, Babu said: “Section 31 of the Cantonment Act 2006, clearly states Cantonment Board chief executive officers have the authority to frame rules and regulations in order to conduct fair and corruption-free elections. But authorities are ignoring these rules.

Soon after MoD issued orders providing reservation for women in civilian wards, major political parties demanded that party leaders also be represented in wards and photo electoral rolls system be implemented in the upcoming polls.

Beggars may soon vanish from Indore streets

INDORE: Beggars may soon vanish from Indore streets. If all goes well, Indore is set to become one of the first 10 beggar-free cities of India. The city has been selected by Centre as one of top-10 big cities to prepare and implement national-level action plan to end beggary.

The campaign, expected to be launched by April, will cover identification, rehabilitation , provision of medical facilities, counselling, education, skill development and sustainable settlement of people engaged in begging. The Union government has sought participation of other stakeholders including state government, local bodies and NGOs.

In response, state social justice department has appointed Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) as ‘nodal agency’ to establish coordination with departments concerned including woman and child development department (WCD), police and Childline for comprehensive rehabilitation of people currently engaged in begging and to ensure that every person has right to live a life of dignity.

In current scenario, WCD has responsibility to provide children accommodation in three orphanages of city, who are found engaged in begging, but has no separate shelter home for them. While, social justice department runs state’s only shelter home for beggars above 60 years of age, the same is in dilapidated condition and has given admission only to a few beggars in said category in last couple of years.

Besides, there is no shelter home to accommodate men, women beyond these categories and district administration also lacks schemes, projects to rehabilitate them.

On receiving Centre’s plan and instructions from state government, district administration has planned a meeting of members of rescue teams to take their suggestions in making action plan while another meeting will be held on February 7 of associations of industries and other departments concerned to help making a rehabilitation plan for beggars.

The district administration had formed two separate teams in coordination with WCD, Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS), social workers, Childline, Special Juvenile Police Unite (SJPU), labour department and police of respected areas to launch a campaign to rescue beggars.

In last four months, joint teams have rescued around 100 children engaged in begging and labour.

In Union government’s said project, it will bear 60 per cent funding while remaining 40 per cent share is expected from state government.

AHMEDABAD: Financial transactions, cheque clearances, issuing of drafts and letters of credit among other transactions might take a hit over the next three days, as branches of some 27 public sector banks in addition to a few private sector banks in the state will remain closed on a two-day strike , and Sunday falls on the third day.

Members of Maha Gujarat Bank Employees Association (MGBEA) are expected to join the nationwide strike on Friday and Saturday. With Sunday being a bank holiday, public sector banks will reopen on Monday.

“Bank employees are protesting non-revision of their wages, which has been pending since November 2017. That apart, we have also sought to reinitiate recruitments in the banking sector. Moreover, since alternate means of banking are now available, we have sought a five-day work week for all banks,” said Janak Rawal, general secretary, MGBEA.

An estimated 6,000 bank branches across Gujarat are expected to remain shut. As a result, bank transactions worth at least Rs 25,000 crore are likely to be impacted over the next two days across Gujarat, suggest estimates by bankers.

Trade and industry bodies have been extremely critical of the bank strike , as the processing of crucial payments, including salaries, could be stalled due to the strike call. A public interest litigation has also been filed in the Gujarat high court earlier this week by Gujarat Trader Federation (GTF) and seven other trade and industry bodies across Gujarat stating how bank strikes are hurting business activity.

“Frequent strikes by bank employees is hurting business activities. When banks are shut during the month end, issuing business payments and salaries becomes difficult,"" said Jayendra Tanna, president, GTF.

Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Thursday remarked that strikes by employees of public sector banks are not in the greater public interest and the striking employees are liable to face punitive action.

Along with this remark, the bench headed by Chief Justice Vikram Nath asked the Centre and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to reply to court’s question as to what action can be taken against striking bank employees. The court verbally observed that banking is an essential sector and a strike by employees would put the people at large at inconvenience. Their individual problems can be resolved through negotiations with the managements and the employees should not resort to action which is against the government’s policy.

The HC made observations and sought replies from the authorities by February 5 in response to a PIL filed by various trade federations through advocate Rashmin Jani. The PIL demanded a declaration that a strike by public sector bank employees is illegal and against the public interest because it stalls economic activity across the country.

The HC ordered the petitioners to serve the relevant documents to the lawyers representing the Centre and the RBI.

Citing the call for a strike on December 31 given by bank employees, the traders claimed that such repeated strike calls by bank employees causes severe problems for trade and industry in carrying out financial transactions. The petitioners highlighted that bank employees have also given a call for a three-day strike in March, and have threatened an indefinite strike from April 1 onwards, if their demands for wage revision and recruitment are not accepted.

It was during a meeting on resolving the issue of double tracking the railway line in South Goa earlier this month that the officer had made the remark. Alina had said that Singh with his derogatory remarks had “insulted all the people present there at the time in particular, and all the people of Goa in general.”

Incidentally, the officer was summoned to tender an apology in the presence of the media on Thursday a day after Cortalim MLA wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressing her displeasure over the controversial remark made by Singh, referring to her as of Portuguese descent.

Former South Goa MP Narendra Sawaikar was one of the first to condemn the Singh remark against Alina and others. The CM, however, had come under criticism for his “silence” over the slur.

The para jumping and ring of fire shows were crowd-pullers. Brigadier S R Mazagaonkar (Retd)

PUNE: Deputy chief of army staff (planning and systems) Lt Gen Sudarshan Hasabnis, along with other serving and retired army officers, including two septuagenarians, participated in an exhilarating para jumping and sky diving exercise at Dighi Hills on Thursday as part of the bicentenary year celebration of the Bombay Engineering Group (BEG) and Centre, also known as the Bombay Sappers.

The event paid tribute to the soldiers who have died in wars and army operations.

“Only the Bombay Sappers have an independent para field company and most of these retired and serving officers have served with this unit. Today’s demonstration showcased their mettle and professionalism. They displayed their prowess in adventure activities by jumping from a height. Some are above the age of 60,” a senior BEG officer said.

Lt Gen Yogendra Dimri, General Officer Commanding of the 21 Corps, Brigadier M J Kumar, Commandant of the BEG and 37 others accompanied Hasabnis as they jumped from an AN-32 transport aircraft of the Indian Air Force flying at a height ranging from 1,200ft to 6,000ft. The event culminated with a sky diving display by veterans Lieutenant General R R Goswami (Retd) and Brigadier S R Mazagaonkar (Retd).

“I served in the para field company from 1980 to 1983 and successfully did 100 para jumps. Post-retirement, I took lessons in sky diving in Dubai and resumed jumping in 2017. It was my 118th jump today and I feel proud about doing it before my unit,” Mazagaonkar, 70, said.

Goswami, 71, a former Engineer-in-Chief of the Corps of Engineers, said, “I have been doing sky diving from 1977. Today’s was my 202th jump. Performing before my unit was a proud moment.”

Brigadier Kumar said, “It was an apt way to pay respect to those brave soldiers, who made the supreme sacrifice on the battlefields from the European theatre to Jammu & Kashmir during pre- and post-independence period over the 200 years.”

KALPETTA: Congress politician Rahul Gandhi on Thursday launched a scathing attack on PM Modi, saying Modi and Nathuram Godse , Mahatma Gandhi ’s assassin, believe in the same ideology.

At a public meeting in his Lok Sabha constituency Wayanad at the end of a ‘Save the Constitution ’ march on Martyrs’ Day, Rahul said both Modi and Godse were filled with hatred. “Nathuram Godse and Narendra Modi believe in the same ideology. There is no difference, except Narendra Modi does not have the guts to say he believes in Nathuram Godse,” he said.

“Godse shot Mahatma Gandhi because he didn’t believe in himself. He loved no one and cared for nobody, and believed in nobody. That is the same with our PM. He only loves himself, he only believes in himself and he is not interested in listening to the billions of voices of the country ,” he said.

“Today, Indians are being made to prove that they are Indians. Who is Narendra Modi to decide if I am Indian? Who has given him the licence to decide who is an Indian and who is not an Indian? There are 1.3 billion Indians who don’t have to prove that they are Indians to these people,” he said. Rahul alleged that the PM was trying to distract the country from issues like economy and jobs.

Kotha Cheruvu covered in water hyacinth.

HYDERABAD: Residents of Alwal circle have finally raised their voice against the dirty lakes and damaged roads in their locality.

According to the residents, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation ( GHMC ) authorities have completely ignored the area. While the road adjacent to Telangana Talli statue cries out for repair, water hyacinth has grown in Kotha Cheruvu and Chinna Rayudu Cheruvu.

“The water is hardly visible and the lakes look like vast green fields as they have not been cleaned for a long time. Mosquito menace has also increased and we fear that local residents will soon suffer from vector-borne diseases,” said Srinivas Varma , a resident of Alwal.

The residents have also filed complaints about sewage from surrounding localities flowing into the lakes.

Meanwhile, residents of Anand Rao Nagar complained about the dismal condition of roads. “The civic authorities told us that road restoration works will be taken up within in a week, but nothing has been done so far. Some roads in Alwal are still in a pathetic condition,” said Vara Kumar, a local resident.

The road connecting Telangana Talli statue with Old Alwal is dotted with potholes. While GHMC workers have filled a few of them with gravel for temporary relief to commuters, many are still in need of repair.

The sewage network in Reddy Colony has also been causing inconvenience to the residents of Old Alwal. A senior citizen lashed out at the local politicians for the poor condition of the sewage network and said, “Ahead of elections, politicians promise new drainage lines, but they fail to keep their promises and blame it on lack of funds.”

Meanwhile, GHMC officials said they are in the process of procuring floating trash collectors to clean the lakes.

150,['31/01/2020'],Memorial to illustrious soldier on BEG premises part of heritage walk,"This story is from January 31, 2020

Savee Erappa Satoor’s memorial has a deep history connected with the Bombay Sappers

PUNE: The bicentenary heritage walks to showcase the contributions of Bombay Sappers will also cover the unique memorial of Savee Erappa Satoor, a soldier who rose to prominence from a ‘boy’ to the rank of Group Subedar Major of the Bombay Sappers centre in the 19th century.

Over five decades of the inspiring military journey of the soldier has been inspiring the Boys’ Companies of the Bombay Sappers even after 137 years.

A Group Subedar Major has administrative power and the person is considered as the seniormost army person among Junior Commissioned Officers and Other Ranks. Traditionally, he deals with all issues related to both ranks.

Satoor’s sincerity at work, his dedication and soldiering spirit had helped him achieve the feat which he may not even have imagined at the time of his induction in the force. He joined the Bombay Sappers as an eight-year-old boy before being recruited as a solider in 1857.

“He participated in the battles of Bushire in Persia, Abyssinia and Central India, his bravery and leadership earning him the respect of his commanders. He rose through the ranks before finally becoming the second Group Subedar Major of the Bombay Sappers, a position he held between 1876 and 1880. He died on December 9, 1883 at Khadki at the age of 60,” the army records read.

His ‘samadhi’ exists today near the old dairy farm inside the Bombay Engineering Group (BEG) and Centre where it is maintained.

A line at the bottom of the gravestone reads, “From Recruit Boyhood to Highest Rank’, and his descendants visit the Centre to this day to pay homage at his grave.

His great grandson Narsing Satoor (90), who retired as head of Yerawada prison press, told TOI on Saturday, “It’s a proud moment for all our family that his samadhi is a part of the heritage walk . People will know about his contributions to the Bombay Sappers.”

The Satoor family originally hails from Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh. “Savee’s father Erappa had also served in the British Army. Erappa was killed when he was deployed on guard duty at Koregaon Bhima victory pillar in 1827. Because of this, his son son Savee was inducted in the Boys’ Company of the Sappers in 1857 and subsequently he made history,” Narsing said.

The military tradition of the family continued as his great grandsons joined the Indian Navy, Maharashtra Police and Indian Army in pre and post-independence era.

“Even after 137 years, the Bombay Sappers has not forgotten his contributions. They organise military function to mark his death anniversary every year on December 9 at his grave. We feel proud whenever we visit the grave,” his great great grandson Sarang said.

A senior army officer from the centre said, “Savee Satoor has become a source of inspiration for our Boys’ Companies. They get inspired by his sincerity and bravery he displayed during his military service in the force.”

151,['31/01/2020'],Maharashtra: Leopard trapped in Kanhere village,"This story is from January 31, 2020

Forest officials said the leopard attacked domestic animals on four occasions in the past 15 days

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: A leopard , believed to have terrorized Katewadi, Kanhere and other villages in Baramati over the past fortnight, has been trapped by the forest department.

Forest department officials said the leopard attacked domestic animals on four occasions in the past 15 days. It was trapped in a cage installed in Kanhere.

Vaibhav Bhalerao, assistant conservator of forests, Pune division, confirmed to TOI that the leopard was trapped in the early hours on Thursday.

“The villagers informed us at 4am today that a leopard has been trapped in the cage, which was installed on the field of Santosh Jadhav, a farmer,” round forest officer Trimbak Jarad said.

The field is located 3-4km away from the village proper. The forest department dispatched an eight-member team to the village to recover the 10-year-old male leopard, Jarad said.

Sugar cane is cultivated on a large scale in Kanhere and its surrounding villages. “Sugar cane fields provide a good hiding place for leopards. The leopard was sighted in Kanhere, Katewadi and the surrounding villages for over the past fortnight. There have been four attacks on domestic animals in these villages. We also spotted a leopard’s pugmarks and installed a cage,” Jarad said.

A sheep was injured in a suspected leopard attack on January 20 in Katewadi, while three days later, a goat was killed and a sheep was injured in Kanhere, sparking panic among the villagers. The forest department installed the cage on January 24.

The leopard has been sent to Pune, where it would be placed under observation for two or three days. “Usually, when a leopard is trapped in a cage, it aggressive and throws itself against the cage, injuring itself. Veterinary doctors will check for any minor injuries and treat them,” Jarad said.

152,['31/01/2020'],‘Youths have to play big role in making khadi global brand’,"This story is from January 31, 2020

Ashok Gehlot during a function at OTS on Wednesday

JAIPUR: The gennext will have to play an important role in our endeavor to make Khadi a global brand, chief minister Ashok Gehlot said while inaugurating an event on how to take iconic fabric to global markets and spread the message of simplicity and self-reliance which Mahatma Gandhi propounded.

He said khadi is a potential medium in the rural areas to provide employment to people, especially women. “This is the reason we took the decision to give 50% debate on khadi products so that the producers, weavers and workers engaged in the occupation would be benefitted. We need to ensure that the gennext finds interest in the occupation which will help us in scaling brand khadi in domestic and overseas markets,” said the chief minister. He said the state government extended the celebration of 150th anniversary of Gandhiji by one year because much of the time last year was lost to elections, leaving limited scope to spread messages of the father of the nation.

Industries minister Prasadi Lal Meena also reiterated the need to provide impetus to the sector through various means so that the gennext takes interest in the craft.

“Because of the historic 50% rebate, khadi sales that stagnated between Rs 60-80 crore in the past five years, would reach Rs 100 crore this year. Also, the chief minister in his Budget has increased the revolving fund size to Rs 10 crore from Rs 3 crore this year,” said Subodh Agarwal, additional chief secretary, Industries.

The revolving fund is used to provide incentives to the institutions engaged in the khadi industry.

The government has sanctioned Rs 2.25 crore to set up a khadi plaza in Bikaner to promote the industry. “A similar plaza is being planned to be set up in Jaipur. Besides, we are taking up various initiatives, especially for the welfare of katins, weavers and workers, for which a budget of Rs 10 crore would be set aside next year,” added Agarwal.

Entrepreneur Shailini Sheth Amin, who addressed the gathering, said that khadi at present lacks clarity in farm to silver-stage linkages.

“We cannot trace where the cotton comes from and which type of cotton it is…All fabrics should have more details on who made it, from which village, region, how many spinners, and weavers were involved in making it. In fact, many accreditation agencies and buyers have approached us to say that we do not know how good khadi production is. But due to gaps in the records, we cannot get world recognized accreditation which stops many buyers to place orders.”

Chief secretary D B Gupta, RIICO managing director Ashutosh Pednekar, Industries commissioner Muktananda Agarwal, and CII-Rajasthan chairman Anand Mishra were also present in the two-day event.

JAIPUR: A cab driver , who was returning home to Alwar after dropping passengers from Nagaur, was found dead on the side of a road on NH-8 on Thursday morning . Initial investigation confirmed that he had been murdered. His vehicle was missing and cops are investigating the case.

The deceased was identified as 32-year-old Raju Jatav who hailed from Nangli Ojha village in Alwar district .

“Jatav’s family was looking for him since Wednesday night as he had called them when he was returning after dropping the passengers at Nagaur and had told them that he was heading home. However he did not make it back. On Thursday morning, the locals informed us about a body lying close to the national highway,” said a police official.

The officials reached the spot but no one could identify the victim and through sources finally identified Jatav. Elaborating further, the official added, “He was strangled with a rope and we could not locate his car anywhere. We are trying to find the possible reasons for this murder and are also looking at the CCTV camera footage on the highway as well as checking his call record details to see who all he spoke with prior to his death.”

Cops are looking at various angles including loot to solve the case. They will trace the passengers who had hired the cab to see if there is a possible connection and if the murder was pre-planned.

155,['31/01/2020'],What should GHMC do to solve the issue of illegal hostels,"This story is from January 31, 2020

Secunderabad: With unauthorised hostels in several parts of the city causing inconvenience for local residents, TOI asked readers what should the GHMC do to solve the issue of illegal hostels

It's not just illegal hostels, but bachelor accommodations in residential areas are also a major cause for concern. The inmates of these hotels listen to loud music till the early hours, consume liquor and often fight on the road. This is an inconvenience for the local residents, especially women. Officials of GHMC and law and order authorities should periodically carry out checks in residential areas and ensure that all property owners are made responsible for the tenants’ behaviour.

Mohammed Zaki Habeeb

Hostels should not be allowed to function in independent buildings or residential complexes. Since the hostel management or warden exercise no control over the movements or activities of the inmates, some of them indulge in vices which are an eyesore to other residents. In fact, it allows anti-social elements to develop clandestine operations at odd hours which are distressing and disturbing. The civic authorities must order closure of all illegal hostels without delay while initiating strict action against the managements. Even owners, who have let out their residence for running hostels, should be booked under relevant laws. The state government should also mull necessary amendments in the GHMC Act to not allow any hostel in and around residential areas.

Srinivasan Ramaswamy

It would be unfair to expect that GHMC officials will be able to carry out checks in every hostel in the city to prevent nuisance. Instead, the civic officials should join hands with local corporators who can help in keeping a tab on hostels in their respective areas and ensure that they do not cause inconvenience to local residents. The corporators can engage volunteers or form vigilance groups with citizens for getting information about hostels. These volunteers can also report issues faced by the residents to the GHMC who in turn can take suitable action.

K Pradeep Kumar

Not only the private hostels of Secunderabad, but many hostels in Hyderabad also pose similar problems. To manage these issues, hostel managements should not operate such establishments in overcrowded places and should always chose areas to nearer to colleges. A library should be available near the hostels and GHMC officials should take care of the sanitation problems to promote personal hygiene and welfare.

Ghanta Snehith

Illegal hostels have become havens of anti-social activities and pose a lot of inconvenience for local residents. All hostels in the city should be registered with the local police stations and regular check by constables should be recorded. Schools and colleges that run hostels should be strict with people entering its premises and not allow non-residents to stay overnight. All hostels should display their names, owner’s contact details and police station limits prominently so that people can lodge complaints if needed.

PANAJI: Implementation of the new provision in the Goa Registration of Tourist Trade Act, that makes it mandatory for online travel aggregators and hotels to register their businesses will start shortly. The tourism department is awaiting for the government to approve the rules for its implementation.

“The rules have been submitted to the government,” said tourism director Menino D’Souza.

D’Souza said all those who offer rooms must register with the tourism department. “The department will act against online travel aggregators if they enroll hotels, guesthouses, or homestays that are not registered with us,” he said, adding that it is mostly guesthouse and homestay operators who run their business online by bypassing the tourism department.

He said they will not hesitate to take suo motu action if they notice violations. D’Souza said that besides losing out on revenue, there is also an issue of security. Anti-social elements can take advantage of this.

The Goa Registration of Tourist Trade Act was amended a year ago, following complaints by industry stakeholders of increase in unregistered rooms who offer their services online.

“Not only are genuine operators affected but the government is also losing revenue,” said a hotelier.

He said it is obvious now that they are losing out on business due to unregistered operators.

“This season many complained of low occupancy which was due to fewer footfalls. Another season we are hit as our business has been usurped by illegal operators,” he said.

He pointed out that in the coastal villages, many operate without registering with the tourism department. This is more prevalent in North Goa villages of Arambol, Morjim, Ashvem and to some extent in Canacona. They can afford to offer their services at a lower rate as they do not pay any taxes, he said.

The fake degrees were detected when they were sent for verification by the hiring firms.

The university administration intends to register FIRs against individuals who submitted these fake AU degrees to bag jobs.

AU Controller of Examinations, professor Ramendra Singh said, “We detected these fake degrees while scrutinising several degrees submitted by various firms which hire our students. the degrees have to be matched with varsity records.”

This is not the first time that fake marksheets or degrees have surfaced. In the past five years, AU officials have detected hundreds of them. In 2014, the varsity had detected over 140 such fake degrees during verification, claimed officials.

Many fake AU degrees had been submitted in south India including Andhra Pradesh , to bag government jobs including those of police and public service commission.

PUNE: The Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government was likely to clear the unified development control (DC) regulations for all revenue divisions, except Mumbai, officials in the urban development department said.The unified development control regulations was proposed by the previous BJP-Shiv Sena government.A senior urban development department official said the new government favoured the proposal following a recent review.The unified development control regulations will be applicable in all districts, except Mumbai, and will help avoid any leeway with the interpretation of the development control rules in a particular area. “Though the rules will broadly be the same, some parameters of the Floor Space Index (FSI) will differ from one metropolitan area to another,” the official said.The government was pushing for these rules across all municipalities and metropolitan areas as part of the ease-of-doing-business reforms and is expected to see an increase in the permissible area for construction in these regions.At present, development permissions in all municipal corporations, municipal councils, metropolitan regions, where the regional plans regarding land use are in place, have their own set of regulations. “This will change if the new unified development control regulations are approved,” the official said.Former CM Devendra Fadnavis , who had also headed the urban development department, had pushed for the proposal. The aim was to make some industrial precincts developed with these rules.Former town planner Ramchandra Gohad had called the unified development control regulations an old concept. He said the Centre had first planned it in 1975 and the state took up its implementation in 1980. Some changes were made in the state plan cleared in 1982.The official said the unified plan would help in overall development and prevent haphazard growth in the state.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73788732,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-163830,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-backs-uniform-dc-rules-across-state/articleshow/73781335.cms

Jaipur: Despite the fact that Kho Nagoriyan is soon expected to receive piped water , it is only 40% of the population in the area that will be able to avail the facility. The remaining 60 per cent population lives in colonies not approved by JDA and for them, the wait only grows longer.

Kho Nagoriyan is a dark zone area where ground water has dried down and people have been demanding water supply for a long time. In 2012, government approved water pipeline for areas of JDA approved colonies in Kho Nagoriyan and now as the work is completed the connections are being given.

Shubhanshu Dixit, superintendent engineer at public health and engineering department (PHED) said, “We have started camps to give connections to people of Kho Nagoriyan and the last date for the same is January 31. The connections will be given immediately after residents apply for a connection either at the camps or by coming to the department.”

When asked about the remaining residents of the Kho Nagoriyan, Dixit said that another pipeline sanctioned in 2018 is under construction and will be completed soon. “The remaining people will get water connectivity by the end of the year as a pipeline is sanctioned which is also known as Bisalpur phase 2 project. The construction of the pipeline will be finished by October 2020 which will benefit remaining people. In all, around 1 lakh people are expected to get water supply,” said Dixit.

Mass movements have been organised by the residents of the areas many times for the supply of water. Tankers are usually provided in the area that pours water in the community water tank in the locality from where people can take water for their household work.

PUNE: There was some commotion outside the city’s Gandhi Bhavan where a programme was organised by the Maharashtra Gandhi Smarak Nidhi (MGSN) on Thursday against the Citizenship Amendment Act, National Register of Citizens and National Population Register.

Some unidentified people assembled outside the venue and started raising slogans in support of CAA. Police swung into action and detained them.

The programme was attended by Actress Urmila Matondkar , Pune Bishop Thomas Dabre, MGSN's Kumar Saptarshi and civil rights activists Teesta Setalvad.

Pratibha Joshi, senior inspector, Kothrud police, told TOI that 40 people were detained for attempting to disrupt the programme at Gandhi Bhavan. ""Initially, 15 men raised slogans outside the Gandhi Bhavan. We immediately detained them. We also detained further 25 men who reached the venue and started raising slogans,"" Joshi said.

She said the police will take action against MGSN as it did not take prior permission. ""Our probe is on,"" Joshi said.

The programme, organised to mark the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, later continued without any disturbance following police intervention. While addressing the gathering, Matondkar condemned the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), terming it as a “black act”.

""The country is united to protect the secular fabric. CAA has come as a hurdle to communal harmony and secularism. The Britishers had drafted a similar law about 100 years ago,” she said.

Pune Bishop Thomas Dabre said the country has been following the principles of social harmony. Division in the society on the basis of religions and caste cannot be accepted, he said.

Saptarshi said that CAA will impact over 40 crore people in the country. “The act is not against the Muslim community. It will also impact the poor people from other religions and castes,” he said.

Coimbatore: With the total dissolved solids (TDS), total hardness and chlorine values exceeding the permissible limits, underground water in and around the Vellalore dumpyard is highly polluted, says a Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) report.

TNPCB had collected water samples from 15 places and tested air quality at five places in and around the yard last November. According to the experts, water in the area has not just become unfit for drinking but also for domestic purposes.

While the permissible limit of TDS that measures the dissolved content of both organic and inorganic substances in drinking water is less than 500ppm for fresh water, the level at most of the areas around the yard is between 880ppm and 3,936ppm, according to the report. The TDS level inside the dumpyard was found to be 18,108ppm.

According to the Indian standard specification, the maximum permissible TDS limit for drinking water is 600mg/l. But the report says that the samples have exceeded it. The same is the case with biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The respirable suspended particulate matter (PM10), which is supposed to be 100 as per the board’s standard, was found to be between 38 and 129. Pollutants including SO2 and NO2 were found in the air.

“The quality of air and water in the region is degrading with every passing day. The more the city corporation delays to take effective steps, the more would be the consequences. The civic body has been giving assurance to reduce the inflow of waste to the dumpyard, but nothing was implemented,” said K S Mohan of the Kurichi and Vellalore Pollution Prevent Action Committee, who obtained the TNPCB report using the right to information (RTI) Act.

Pointing out that the foul smell emanating from the dumpyard had drastically increased in the last couple of months, Mohan said that local residents are suffering from frequent headache and throat pain, apart from respiratory problems.

Daniel Jesudass, a resident and activist, blamed the corporation. “The pollution level increased only because the corporation failed to follow any of the measures required to be followed while handling waste,” he said.

When contacted, a corporation official said that the civic body will soon float a tender to scientifically dispose the waste through biomining.

JAIPUR: The Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) has sought permission from the Rajasthan High Court for construction of underground parking at Ramniwas Bagh which will be an extension of existing one.

As the court has banned any kind of construction in the Bagh, the civic body has requested a permission to be granted to avoid future hassle. To reduce snarls in Walled City, the JDA has recently proposed extension of the underground parking at Ramniwas Bagh.

As per the preliminary design, most of the construction will be below the Union Football Ground at the park. The parking will be constructed in L-shape.

An official said the JDA proposed to extend the underground parking till Jaipur Traffic Police office towards Ajmeri Gate end. However, the authorities are apprehensive about constructing a parking space beneath Sawan Bhado Park as it might violate high court directives, which prohibited construction of any kind in that area.

KANPUR: The designated dacoity affected area court Kanpur Dehat on Friday once again adjourned the delivery of judgment in Behmai massacre case and fixed February 12 as the next date for order.

According to district government counsel Rajeev Porwal , the date was adjourned due to strike of advocates against an order of district judiciary. The court had earlier fixed January 24 for hearing of the case and further order but due to strike of advocates, no hearing could take place. The presiding officer had fixed January 30 as next date.

Talking to TOI, Porwal stated that advocates of Kanpur Dehat court have no chambers in the court campus and they have to sit in corridor or verandah for legal work. The judgeship had asked them to vacate the corridor and verandah and court staff had seized chairs and tables of some advocates.

The advocates were protesting against that move, and they were not allowing anyone to enter the courtroom. As a result, no hearing could take place, DGC said.

Though the case was lodged against about three dozen dacoits including Phoolan Devi but at present case is being heard against four dacoits and they are Posa, Bheekha, Vishwanath alias Krishna Kumar alias Putani and Shyam Sundar.

JAIPUR: A day after Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) increased the regularisation and development fee for the Prithvi Raj Nagar, former urban development and housing (UDH) minister Rajpal Singh accused the government of benefiting the land mafia. He alleged that JDA is imposing heavy fee on poor and regularising plots more than 1,000 square yards is unjustified and exploitation of poor plot owners.

“Our government has devised the revenue model to acquire land of bigger plots and provide relief to poor. The ruling party in connivance with land mafia has tweaked the rules to fill their coffers,” said Singh.

He said, JDA has not developed facilities in PRN area with Rs 1,250 crore, collected after regularisation of plots in their tenure. “An integrated plan was prepared to develop facilities in PRN scheme. However, no such attempt has been made to provide facilities to plot owners. The JDA intentions is to earn revenue from poor residents for its own survival,” he added. The (JDA) on Wednesday increased the regularisation and development charges for (PRN) Scheme. For a 100 square yard plot, the JDA will now charge Rs 300 regularisation charge (per square yard), which will include allotment rates. Similarly, for plot size between 101 to 300 square yard, the JDA would charge Rs 480 regularisation charge (per square yard) including allotment rates.

Owners having a plot more than 1,000 square yard will have to give 1.5 times regularisation charges. For regularising the marriage garden in the scheme which are developed on the plot size above 2,000 square yard, the JDA has fixed Rs 1,500 (per square yard) regularisation charge.

The residents even believe, the charges fixed to provide development and basic facilities in the (PRN) scheme has become out of reach of people who have not taken lease deeds till date. Residents believe, initiative should have taken to reduce the development rates so that water, electricity, roads and sewerage can be provided to the residents on nominal rates.

Giriraj Singh Khangarot, president of Prithviraj Nagar Sanyukt Jan Sangharsh Samiti, said, “The plot owners who haven’t applied for lease deeds were actually poor. The development and regularisation rates of PRN were already high. The government should have provide relaxation to these owners rather than increasing rates,” he said.

TimesView After decades, the quest for a ‘cattle-free’ Jaipur remains a distant dream. Illegal dairy farms continue to thrive in densely populated Walled City area, years after the high court ordered the municipal corporation to shift them outside the city. Apart from being illegal, these dairies are creating sanitation and health problems for both cattle and residents of the area. The Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) had taken action to shift these dairies after a foreign tourist was gored by a bull a year ago. However, the drive lost steam and dairies continue to flourish under the patronage of official and local politicians. If the situation is to change, authorities have to act against officials who are repeatedly failing the system.

JAIPUR: In a blatant violation of Rajasthan high court order, illegal dairies continue to thrive in the Walled City areas right under the nose of the Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC). The JMC has stated in the high court in November 2019 that it will make the city free of illegal dairy within two months. However, nothing has changed.Illegal dairy business has been a problem for Jaipur for a long time and the JMC has been asked to shift them to the outskirts of the city. Many drives were started by the JMC officials to close down the dairy but one round in the Walled City area can show the reality.As per norms, an owner having more than four animals will be considered to be running a dairy. Following the order to shift the dairy owners, land was allotted to them three places in Jaipur.Around the Govind Dev ji temple cattle are tied on road without any fear of the authorities. The business is carrying on despite all the raids that have been conducted in the past. Deputy commissioner, animal husbandry at JMC, Ram Kishore Meena wasn’t available for any comment. In the past, there have been many attacks on the employees of JMC as well when they went to seize the cattle. Officials at JMC said that people in power have been backing these dairy owners due to which it gets difficult to move them.In 1999, the dairy owners were allotted land outside the city by Jaipur Development Authority (JDA).

Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an event, Kavalekar said that he has even raised the issue on several occasions in the House.

“It’s a misconception that the powers of the MLA will be curtailed if zilla panchayat members are given more powers. On the contrary, pressure of work on MLAs will be eased to a large extent if ZPs are also given more powers. After all, we are here to do the service of the public. Devolution of more powers and funds to the zilla panchayat members will lead to better service of the public,” Kavalekar said.

Replying to a query, Kavalekar said that all ZP members who supported him while in Congress, are now with him in BJP, even as he exuded confidence about the victory of his candidates in the ZP elections.

Police said Prasad attacked the woman with acid because she spurned his advances and refused to marry him

HAVERI: Haveri police have nabbed a 25-year-old man in connection with an acid attack on a woman here on Tuesday. The man, identified as Prasad Chikkali, hails from Chikkabasur village of Byadagi taluk.

Prasad, who completed postgraduation in journalism from Karnatak University in Dharwad, is unemployed. The victim, who works at the human resource department in a garment factory in Byadagi, had also studied at the same PG centre.

The initial probe has revealed that the 24-year-old victim and Prasad were previously in a relationship and he had duped the woman making multiple false claims. He reportedly told her that he had cleared Karnataka Administrative Service and was currently posted as deputy superintendent of police.

“Initially, the girl believed him and agreed to the relationship. However, as time passed, the victim figured out the truth and began to avoid him. Subsequently, he turned suspicious,” said K G Devaraj, SP, Haveri.

“He called her multiple times asking her to marry him, show eight-months old call records,” he added.

Prasad, as a revenge for the woman’s refusal to marry him, resorted to acid attack to disfigure her, the SP said. Police are trying to find out where he had sourced the acid from, he added.

Sources in the department said the acid may have been sourced from outside the district and effort is on to locate the supplier.

174,['31/01/2020'],‘Need to make journalism more people oriented’,"This story is from January 31, 2020

Nagpur: In his publication ‘Mooknayak’, Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar wanted to make ‘mute’ people the leaders, the heroes. Therefore, efforts should be done to make this kind of 100-year-old journalism more people-oriented was the view speakers at a seminar on ‘Purogami chalwali aani aajchi patrakarita’ said on Thursday.

The national seminar, divided into three sessions, was organized by the department of Marathi of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar College, Deekshabhoomi as part of Mooknayak Shatabdi Mahotsav.

In his address, senior scribe Shailesh Pande said journalism today has undergone a lot of changes with many social media portals indulging in spreading canards and sullying the image of mainstream reporting which is not a good sign as people easily fall prey to fake news.

Pande said, “Earlier the situation on the journalistic front was different from what it is today. There may have been different schools of thought that time too, but journalism was maintaining its dignity and giving a fair report of the changes taking place in various fields.”

“It is observed these days that revealing the truth may not go down well with some quarters and therefore a journalist has to think twice before cracking a story. In Dr Ambedkar’s times, journalists had the freedom to put forth their views without any fear,” he added.

Emergence of social media has completely changed the scenario with the vested interests taking undue advantage and branding fake news as the genuine which is nothing but playing mindgames with innocent citizens, he added.

It is also true that there are some issues in society which cannot be changed by journalists or the government. This can be achieved by bringing about a change in the mindset of the society, Pande said.

Those who spoke in various sessions included senior journalists Prakash Dubey, Shripad Aparajit and Sunil Khobragade; Satish Pawde, Balwant Bhoyar, Bhimrao Gote, Surendra Gondane, Mahendra Gaikwad, Ishwar Somnathe and Bhushan Ramteke.

The speakers were of the opinion that journalism in old times was fearless and contributed to the betterment of the society. These days, there are reports of paid media playing its part, they said.

The speakers said journalism was a mission in the past. But things have changed these days with most of the youngsters joining the profession for money and glamour it provides, they added.

Kalpana Shinde conducted the proceedings. Satish Kapre proposed a vote of thanks.

Coimbatore: The city corporation in association with Bharathi Park Ladies’ Association (BPLA) on Thursday installed leaf composters at five temples in and around Saibaba Colony. The idea is to compost flower and leaf waste generated in the temples.

President of BPLA Menaka Vairavan said, “Until recently, the green waste, especially leaves and flowers, was getting mixed with other waste and ending up at the dump yard in Vellalore. The purpose of installing the composters at the temple is to prevent mixing of the waste and to ensure that flower and leaf waste is composted on the temple premises itself.”

For the waste generated in a temple, one composter is sufficient as flower and leaf waste shrink once dried up. The waste would get decomposed within 45 to 60 days naturally. On the floor of the composter, a banana leaf and soil should be placed before putting wastes into it. Once in three days, water should be sprinkled on the waste, said Menaka, who is also a Swachh Bharat Ambassador.

The compost could be used either to produce incense sticks or used as fertilizer for flowering plants, she said.

The corporation has also warned the public of slapping a penalty of up to Rs 5,000 if they were to mix other wastes in the composter. Upon mixing the other waste, including food, in the composter, chances for the formation of worms and emanating foul smell is extremely high, she said.

“The corporation has not imposed penalty for not segregating waste due to lack of awareness among the people. Now that the awareness level has increased, penalty should be imposed on the violators,”Menaka Vairavan said.

According to officials, the drive was conducted as street vendors and squatters had occupied internal roads and streets in the market leading to huge traffic snarls in the area. Also, a few shops in the area too had made unauthorised extensions encroaching upon the lanes. Teams of VMC removed handcarts, counters and other materials from the market in the morning. The teams removed eight truckloads of materials from the area to clear the streets. Five structures that were unauthorised were also razed by the civic body’s teams.

The civic body has been conducting drives periodically to remove encroachments in the area. However, these keep returning and thereby leading to congestion.

Amaravati: The comments made by the Andhra Pradesh High Court , during the hearing of a PIL, has put a question mark on when the Group-I main examinations will be held.

The HC had suggested that the APPSC may consider a fresh preliminary examination given the fact that nearly 50 out of the 120 questions were not appropriate.

Although, the HC adjourned the court seeking affidavit from APPSC, experts have advised the government to annul the examination. They say even if the HC allows APPSC to go ahead, students would approach the Supreme Court which might delay the process.

“Instead of wasting students’ time, it is desirable for the PSC to conduct fresh examination,” said Dr Hanumantha Rao, a faculty at a training institute. He said there were instances where the SC had cancelled many state services exams on such grounds and it was better not to delay the process posing more trouble to the students.

Sources said many candidates had quit their jobs in private sector to prepare for the test. Government employees, including teachers and college lectures, had been preparing for the examination by applying for leave under loss of pay.

Many candidates were irked by the recent developments. “I have lost nearly 18 months since I started my prelims preparation,” said a woman candidate. She said she had turned downed several job offers since the completion of graduation with the sole aim of clinching the Group-I job.

183,['31/01/2020'],Major Amrut scheme likely to miss deadline,"This story is from January 31, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The capital has already started experiencing water shortage much ahead of the summer. The lone hope of city is in the proposed commissioning of the 75mld treatment plant at Aruvikkara under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation ( AMRUT ) in March, which could boost the supply of drinking water to the city.

However, there is uncertainty on whether the project can meet the March deadline as there is delay in release of funds. Restriction imposed on release of funds from the treasury due to financial crisis is the reason for the delay.

Under AMRUT project, 50% fund is provided by the Centre, 30% by the state government and 20% by local bodies. For the past several months, around Rs 30 crore is pending for various projects under the sewerage wing and the Kerala water authority (KWA). Of these, the 75mld treatment plant alone has a pending dues worth Rs 17 crore.

Executive engineer of KWA has recently sent a letter to the corporation secretary demanding immediate steps to allot funds for pending bills worth Rs 30 crore for various works under AMRUT in the city. Some of the bills are pending since March, 2019.

Earlier, exemptions were given to release of funds for schemes sponsored by the Centre. However, later the government imposed restrictions on such schemes too.

Sources said the construction of the 75mld treatment plant was progressing as per schedule, but delay in payment would affect the work. “Now the work has entered a phase where the machinery will have to be purchased for the plant. Unless there is immediate release of funds, it will be difficult to meet the March deadline,” said sources. The 75mld treatment plant is being constructed by Chicago Constructions International Private Ltd.

Some other works which are affected by the delay in payment are renovation works of sewage treatment plant at Medical College and laying of pumping main line from Edathara pump house to sewage treatment plant at Muttathara.

Sources said that fund release under AMRUT went without hassles for the first two years and issues cropped up later. For projects with March deadline, the financial hurdles are set to be a major roadblock.

cap

Vadodara: Feeding stray dogs resulted in a clash between two neighbours in Gorwa that eventually ended at the police station on Wednesday.

Tired of dog barks throughout the nights, two residents of Shantinagar Society in Gorwa – Dipen Patel and Aatish Patel – chased away the dogs with sticks from their society on January 28. But this action of the duo irked their neighbour Bina Joshi and her daughter Prerna. The mother-daughter duo confronted Dipen and Aatish regarding shoving sticks at stray dogs and allegedly started recording video in their mobile phone.

Beena alleged that it was Dipen and Aatish who started the arguments. The duo shouted at Beena saying who will be held responsible if the stray dogs bite someone and asked her to keep the stray dogs in her house. Both alleged each other of using foul language and lodged cross complaints at Gorwa police station.

Beena lodged a case of using obscene words in public and under Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act against Dipen and Aatish. On the other hand, Dipen’s wife lodged a case of using obscene words and criminal intimidation against Beena and Prerna.

“The stray dogs have bitten five to six people in the society and my husband and our neighbour were chasing the dogs away only because one of the canines attacked our three-year-old daughter last Sunday. Although the dogs have been barking all nights, we have never chased them away, it was only after the attack on our daughter that we felt that these animals cannot be tolerated any longer,” said Dipen’s wife Trupti. She added that Beena and her daughter have been feeding the dogs daily for past two years.

TOI tried to contact Beena, but the calls were not answered.

Vijayawada: AP School Education Regulatory and Monitoring Commission (APSERMC) has proposed to cancel examination centres in private and corporate schools.

Addressing a media conference here on Thursday, APSERMC chairman Justice Kantha Rao said that the commission has noticed several discrepancies in the conduct of practical examinations at these centres.

Rao said private schools and colleges were taking advantage of practical examinations. “College managements are at liberty to influence the authorities and get high marks for their students in practical examinations. We came to know that some colleges were giving marks without conducting the exams. This is a serious issue and we have decided to take stringent action,” he said.

The commission said inspecting authorities, including district, deputy and mandal education officers, were found wanting in their duties.

The commission has also proposed to establish a mechanism to conduct regular inspections in private and government schools in order to improve the quality of education in the state.

The commission said it would take serious action against teaching and and non-teaching staff who were found guilty of sexual harassment charges.

“Teachers who were suspended on charges of sexual harassment against students and co-faculty will not be posted in the same school. The commission has proposed to complete departmental inquiry within a month and initiate action against the guilty,” he said.

The commission said that it would suggest including lessons on gender equality in curriculum. “We should sensitize the students about gender equality and there would be punishment for misbehaving with women. This will help the next generation to respect women and treat them equally. We have started designing special lessons on gender equality and they will be included in the curriculum for high school classes,” said Kantha Rao.

In PN Pudur, vacant plots are present at Radhika Avenue, Chinnasami Nagar, Veerasami Colony, Periyar Ramasamy Extension, Aiswarya Nagar and Vivekanandan Extension, among others. “There are more than 20 vacant plots and each of them on an average measure anywhere between two cents and five cents. Filled with shrubs, they are today breeding grounds of mosquitoes and home to snakes,” said N Chandran, a resident of the area.

He said around a year ago a wild boar had taken refuge in one of the plots, creating panic among the residents. “The animal entered the area early in the morning and it was captured only by night.”

Anti-social elements, meanwhile, use these plots to consume liquor. “After drinking, they simply dump the bottles there itself,” he said.

CHANDIGARH: The prices of premium brands of whisky and beer are likely to go up in the next financial year.

The Chandigarh administration is considering to increase prices by 10% to 15% in the next excise policy, which will come into force from April 1. Sources in the UT administration said the officials were contemplating hike in prices of whisky and beer and those of wine and beer at microbreweries were likely to go down. A senior UT officer said they were working on the proposal and final decision would soon be taken by the top officials of the UT administration.

In the current excise policy, the prices of premium brands of whisky had gone up by around 20%. However, the rates of beer and wine had remained unchanged and those of beer at microbrewery had gone down.

Recently, the UT administration had invited members of the Chandigarh Hospitality Association for suggestions and objections on the proposed excise policy.

According to the UT administration, the 2019-20 excise policy would help the administration earn a revenue Rs 600 crore as compared to Rs 510 crore in 2018-19.

Under the current policy, excise levies on country-made liquor was increased by approximately 17% and on India-made foreign liquor (IMFL) by approximately 20%. To promote low alcoholic contents beverages, like beer and wine, and boost Indian wine industry, the licence fee was not increased and kept at Rs 12,000 for the whole year. The label registration fee of wine was reduced from Rs 15,000 to Rs 10,000 per brand.

In the current excise policy, the excise duty of microbrewery was reduced from Rs 50 per bulk litre to Rs 30 to shift consumers from hard liquor to soft. The licence fees of microbrewery, restaurants/pubs and bar was also not increased.

‘Lower age limit’

Representatives of the Chandigarh Hospitality Association had urged the UT excise and taxation department to lower alcohol consumption age in Chandigarh from 25 to 21 years for the next financial year. The hoteliers had also demanded extension of bar timings from 1am to 2am. The department had sought suggestions from hoteliers and wine merchants’ body before finalising the excise policy.

Coimbatore: Collector K Rajamani has asked all the private companies to form internal complaints committee to address sexual harassment complaints of women at workplace.

Rajamani has warned that private organisations that do not form the internal complaints committee (ICC) would face government action. So far, 37 private companies and educational institutions have formed ICC and quarterly reports are collected from them. This apart, all government departments in the district have also formed the committees.

In a statement, Rajamani said that the Centre enacted the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, which mandates all government offices, private companies, educational institutions with more than 10 women employees should have an ICC. A local complaints committee formed at the district level will monitor the ICC.

While the ICC with three members should have a woman as its head, the district level committee will have five members with the district collector as chairman, the district social welfare officer, two representatives from NGOs and an advocate as members.

Rajamani said nodal officers were appointed in 2017 to inquire complaints within city corporation, municipality, two panchayats, block and taluk level in government offices. Victims who suffer sexual harassment can approach the district level committee or the nodal officers. So far, three complaints were received, and inquiry conducted where the identity of the victims were kept discrete, he said.

This apart, women can also submit complaints in the central government’s portal www.shebox.nic.in, he said.

Aurangabad: District guardian minister Subhash Desai on Thursday said that the Kanchanwadi biogas plant will be ready in February and 150-tonne waste treatment plant at Padegaon within two months.

The minister was speaking following his visit to Chikalthana and Kanchanwadi waste treatment facilities.

The state government has approved Rs 148 crore for Aurangabad ’s solid waste management (SWM) project. The project includes three 150-tonnes per day (TPD) capacity plants, a 30 TPD biogas plant, a sanitary landfill at Padegaon and closure of legacy dump at Naregaon.

One of the 150 TPD waste treatment plant became operational at Chikalthana in June last year. Currently, it is the only waste treatment plant in the city.

Desai said that when the other plants become operational, the load on the Chikalthana plant will reduce.

Incidentally, the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has missed several deadlines given to the high court previously on completion of the SWM project despite timely provision of funds by the state government.

In the Aurangabad district planning committee meeting held on Thursday, several city-related issues were discussed. Desai said that it has been decided that the electricity poles and cables that were becoming a hurdle in road widening will be removed with the allocation of funds.

On the Balasaheb Thackeray memorial at Priyadarshini Garden, the guardian minister said that the chief minister has reiterated that 100% of the trees will be conserved.

“The previous proposal of transplanting some of the trees has been cancelled. I have personally attended two meetings on the design of the memorial. The AMC has been asked to prepare and submit the DPR to the state government, so that it can be given technical and administrative approval,” Desai said.

The AMC had earlier sought Rs 65 crore for the construction of the memorial but according to the approved design, the cost has been reduced to Rs 25 crore. The reduction in civil works has led to reduction of costs, mayor Nandkumar Ghodele said.

VADODARA: A senior clerk of state reserve police force (SRPF) was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for five years on Thursday for submitting a forged certificate of passing Course on Computer Concepts (CCC) exam to get promotion as head clerk.

The convict Vasantkumar Samajpati, who lives on Ajwa Road and worked at SRPF Group-I in Lalbaug, was also fined of Rs 11,000 by the court of additional chief judicial magistrate P N Navin.

As per the details of the case, Samajpati forged the certificate with seal and stamp of Government Polytechnic for Girls from Ahmedabad sometime between November 2013 and April 2015 and submitted to get promotion as the head clerk at SRPF Group-V in Godhra. Government rules mandate passing of CCC exam.

After the promotion was granted to Samajpati, his certificate was sent to the Ahmedabad-based institution for verification.

The institute replied to the SRPF that no examination of CCC was conducted by them on the date mentioned in the certificate and no person with the name in the certificate took the exam there.

Based on the response, a departmental inquiry was conducted and then a case of forgery, using forged document as genuine and possessing counterfeit seal was registered at Navapura police station against Samajpati and one Krutal Shah from he had allegedly taken the forged certificate.

During trial, charges against Shah were not proven but the evidence against Samajpati convicted him.

While sentencing the punishment, the court stated, “It is a serious matter that the accused working in a disciplined force has used a forged certificate to get promotion … by using a forged certificate as genuine one, he has taken away rights of an eligible candidate and taken illegal benefits so the accused should get strict punishment.”

Coimbatore: Residents of certain parts of Peelamedu, especially ward 35, on Thursday said they haven’t received non-potable water for more than a week and urged the city corporation to supply the same daily without any fail. Ward 35 mainly comprises Ramasamy layout and Indira Gandhi Road.

R Chandrasekhar, a resident of Ramasamy layout, said, “This is the water we use for bathing, kitchen and toilet purposes, and cleaning. Most areas receive non-potable water every day. We, however, always used to receive it only once in four days that too after meeting city corporation officials.”

Pointing out that drinking water was supplied to them only once in 10 days, he said they often run out of water after the seventh day of supply. “We also don’t receive enough drinking water.”

Another resident from Indira Gandhi Road also said they had to be extremely careful with the usage of drinking water, which was supplied once in seven or 10 days.

Another resident, R Venugopal, said, “While we don’t mind being careful with the usage of drinking water, not supplying us non-potable water is a big concern. We can’t even bathe or use toilets.”

NAMAKKAL: Nearly a week after it started to fix egg prices thrice a week, the National Egg Coordination Committee (NECC) on Thursday reversed to its previous method of fixing prices daily, but with a change in timing.

According to NECC chairman Dr P Selvaraj, the decision was taken as the retail egg traders were not following the price fixed by them.

The retailers had earlier cited practical difficulties in following the price fixed by NECC. One of the issues that they highlighted was fluctuation in rate which was affecting the sales badly.

“They have formed a syndicate and is working against us. They are fixing their own price. We had warned them to change the price fixing pattern if they did not follow our rate,” the NECC chairman said.

Now, the egg price would be fixed at 12.15pm every day, against 7pm earlier. Selvaraj said the price would be fixed based on demand and supply.

While NECC has called on poultry farmers to sell eggs at the price fixed by it, the latter have found themselves in a difficult situation.

“When the egg retailers have formed a syndicate, how can we stick to NECC rate?” asked P Senthil Nathan, a poultry farmer. He also urged NECC to solve the issue amicably and help poultry industry grow.

NECC is the authority to fix the price of egg that is produced in Namakkal district .

Amaravati: Peddireddy Midhun Reddy, YSRC MP from Rajampet, on Thursday said the party has raised its objection to the proposed National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) and National Population Register ( NPR ).

He said the party has made this point clear at the all-party meeting convened by minister for parliamentary affairs Prahlad Joshi which was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

He said the party has told the Centre that it would stand in support of the minorities and sought a debate on the issue in Parliament. “We requested the Prime Minister and minister for parliamentary affairs to allow a discussion on NPR and NRC in the Budget session of Parliament as the information sought in NPR is different from what was asked earlier,” said Midhun Reddy.

Speaking to media in New Delhi after the all-party meeting on Thursday, Reddy said there was a sense of unease among the minorities in the country after the Citizens Amendment Act ( CAA ) was cleared by Parliament.

Although YSRC has supported CAA, the party would oppose NPR and NRC in all forms. He said CAA was different from NPR and NRC. He said CAA was as an issue related to the granting of citizenship for the persecuted minorities in neighouring countries.

“We will oppose NRC and NPR if the Centre wants to go ahead,” said Midhun Reddy. He said that a discussion in Parliament would help the government to understand public mood on the issue. He said chief minister and party president Y S Jaganmohan Reddy has directed them to oppose anything that is against the wishes of the minorities.

Bhubaneswar: The relentless effort of a single man for more than six decades has kept Ghoda Nacha, a unique folk art tradition of Odisha alive. Seventy-five-year-old Utsav Charan Das from Chaudwar not only revived the art form but also improved it with continuous research and value addition making it a powerful medium to create awareness on various social and relevant issues. Das was selected for Padma Shri for 2020.

“From the day I performed Ghoda Nacha for the first time on stage with my father in 1960s, the dance form has always occupied my mind. In good times or bad times, during adversity or pleasure I worked for promotion and preservation of the art form and will do that till my last breath,” said Das.

Ghoda Nacha is a folk dance form of fishermen community and as the name suggests dancers perform wearing a replica of a horse and are accompanied by singers and instrumentalists. Each troupe comprises of at least 12 performers, who dance, sing and play during the performance that continues for 30 minutes to two hours and so.

Earlier, Ghoda Nacha was performed in Chaitra (April-May) once a year. “Men used to dress as women artists and perform mostly on mythological subjects. But later I tried to give social messages through the performances on various occasions throughout the year and also made it popular by performances in All India Radio and Doordarshan,” he said.

A matriculate, Das had got a job as a stenographer in the state government but decided to quit as he wanted to make Ghoda Nacha his full-time profession.

Das, a recipient of Odisha Sangeet Natak Akademi award, writes, composes, sings and dances for the performances and has written many songs on issues like health issues, AIDS, malaria, leprosy prevention, Swachh Bharat, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao and so on.

“I have to do a lot of reading to write the songs on relevant topics and also to compose music for them. Over the years, several youngsters got encouraged to learn the art from and take it up as a career. But today’s youth dont have patience and want overnight success, so they are not getting success,” Das pointed.

Seeking government’s support for setting up an institution of fork art in Odisha, Das said, “The only way of keeping alive these dying art forms is by creating next generation of performers and documenting them for future. Government must set up an institute for transferring our rich legacy of art and culture from one generation to the next,” he said, adding, “There should be gradation of artists by the government instead of putting everyone in same category of folk artists”.

220,['31/01/2020'],Johal’s wife refused leave to stay in UK,"This story is from January 31, 2020

London:The wife of Jagtar Johal alias Jaggi , who is in Tihar Jail for his alleged role in targeted killings in Punjab , has been denied leave to remain in the UK .

Gurpeet Kaur, who revealed her identity for the first time in the Indian media, has been living in Scotland since April 2019. Speaking to TOI from Dumbarton, where she lives with Johal’s two brothers, their families, her father-in-law and grandparents, Kaur said: “Where am I supposed to go? My husband is in jail and my in-laws are in the UK. I have nowhere to go in India. Every girl dreams of getting married and spending the rest of her life with her husband. I should be with my in-laws.”

On January 18, the UK’s home ministry, called Home Office, turned down her application for further leave to remain in Britain. The family’s Edinburgh-based lawyer Damir Duheric, who lodged an appeal on January 22, said, “We are raising Article 8 and potentially Article 3 of the European Court of Human Rights in our appeal.” “Many factors need to be taken into account when claiming asylum, so a human rights application seemed more appropriate,” he said, adding the appeal process would take a few months.

Kaur, 30, came to the UK in April 2019 on one-month ‘outside of immigration rules’ visa, which is given in exceptional circumstances. “In India, she had applied for a two-year multiple entry tourist visa,” said Johal’s brother Gurpreet Singh, a human rights and asylum lawyer, in Scotland. “But all they gave her was this.” Before the one month visa expired, he submitted an application on her behalf on human rights grounds for leave to remain for two-and-a-half years so she could stay in Dumbarton. “She would be of no support to Johal in India as it is an eight hour journey from Punjab to Delhi by bus. She also doesn’t have anywhere to go in Punjab,” he said. “It took from May 2019 until last Saturday to get the answer.”

The grounds for refusal, he said, were that her application did not meet immigration rules and there were no exceptional circumstances. “Though they accepted this was a unique situation, and Jaggi’s situation was unique, they said sine she spent 30 years living in India, she should go back there,” he said.

“The British government is putting a post-Brexit trade deal with India above human rights,” he alleged. “Foreign secretary Dominic Raab still has not met us. The UK government is failing Jagtar and now his wife.”

Kaur was out shopping with Jaggi, 32, in Rama Mandir on November 4, 2017, just weeks after they tied the knot, when he was arrested. He maintains his innocence and claims being targeted because he was running a website in Britain translating from Punjabi to English about the events of 1984.

The chargesheet filed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in Punjab alleges he paid Rs 2.7 lakh to late Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) chief Harminder Singh Mintoo in France in 2013, to execute the killing of RSS leader Ravinder Gosain in October 2017. He has also been named by NIA in Brig Jagdish Kumar Gagneja (retd) murder case.

At that time of his arrest, the newlyweds were staying with Jagtar’s paternal grandmother in a village in Jalandhar. “However, the Indian authorities were after her and she had to be on the run and stay in different places,” Gurpreet alleged. “A spouse visa could not be applied for because Jagtar would have to sign it off,” he added.

Cap

Vadodara: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) sought police security on Thursday to conduct repair work on the main pipeline supplying water to the city from the French wells in Mahi river. The deployment was sought as villagers had stopped work on the pipeline demanding supply of water from it.

The pipeline was damaged near Sankarda village. While the civic body had diverted water from a new pipeline laid parallel to the existing one, the old pipeline was being repaired to ensure that an alternative was available.

According to VMC officials, the leakage had come to light early on Monday morning. The diversion was provided on the same day and work to repair the existing pipeline began on Tuesday. Late on Wednesday afternoon, a group of persons staying in the nearby areas came at the site and demanded that they should be given a tapping in the pipeline for drawing water.

A VMC engineer said that the demand could not be met due to policy limitations. Also, the portion of the damaged pipeline was being replaced with a steel pipeline making it difficult to provide any outlet. Villagers, however, did not relent and were aggressive. Work on the pipeline had come to a stall on Wednesday. Tempers of most people cooled only after intervention of MLA Ketan Inamdar, but some were still persistent with the demand.

As a precautionary measure, VMC sought police security for the repair of the pipeline. On Thursday, work was resumed in the presence of policemen and is expected to get over by Friday. Water suppy, however, will stay unaffected.

KENDRAPADA: The Odisha State Pollution Control Board ( OSPCB ) has slapped a Rs 2 crore fine on two industries and a penalty of Rs 25 lakh each on five hotels in Paradip for polluting the environment.

“We have fined the two industries Rs 1 crore each and the five hotels Rs 25 lakh each,” said Ramesh Kumar Ekka, regional officer of OSPCB, Paradip. They have been asked to deposit the amount within 15 days. The OSPCB had earlier issued show cause notices to them on January 24.

As per the OSPCB, the comprehensive environmental pollution index (CEPI) in Paradip at present is 60.61, bringing the town under severe pollution zone. “In 2018, the National Green Tribunal directed OSPCB to take stern action against the polluting units. It is because of this that they were fined,” Ekka stated.

Two years back, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) identified Paradip Port as one of the most polluted areas of the state. It had declared Angul, Talcher, Ib Valley and Jharsuguda as critically polluted industrial areas under CEPI parameters.

CPCB’s analysis reveals that 43 industrial areas or clusters out of 88 in the country are critically polluted with respect to one or more environmental components. In this, Paradip ranks 44th. Five years back, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, identified Paradip industrial hub as one of the country’s most polluted places.

Locals welcomed OSPCB decision to fine polluting units in Paradip. “The fate of people living near Paradip and adjoining villages is at stake because of the air and water pollution caused by 15 polluting industries , including the port,” said Sarat Rout of Paradip.

Dust from coal dumped near Paradip port for distribution purpose spreads due to the wind and often settles on the ground, damaging crops, Rout alleges. He also claimed that water and air pollution are causing many people to suffer from skin diseases, kidney ailments and cancer.

ERODE: Teachers at the government higher secondary school at Alampalayam near Andhiyur are well aware that there is no gain without pain as they put in extra hours to prepare students of Classes X, XI and XII for the upcoming board examinations. And their target is to achieve 100% pass.

S Jayakumar, school headmaster, said, they were conducting special classes for a total of 153 students after the school hours at 5pm. “The classes would go on until 8pm-8.30pm. The classes are being conducted with the consent of students and their parents, who welcomed the idea wholeheartedly,” he said.

The headmaster said 80 of the 153 students were from tribal villages. “They have to travel long distances and won’t often get enough time to study. So, special classes will come handy for them. We will allow them to go to their houses only if they are accompanied by parents. Otherwise, we will arrange them stay in the school hostel.”

The students are provided dinner at the school itself and the fund for the same is being raised through the parent-teacher association. The headmaster said there were instances of teachers spending from their pocket when they were short of fund to arrange food for the students. The teachers have, meanwhile, prepared the lessons in both ‘audio’ and ‘video’ formats, allowing the students to play them on their smart phones. The teachers are also offering computer classes to the interested students.

Jayakumar said they would also conduct special tests for the students. “We will ensure that each student faces the board exam without any fear. We will cover all the subjects.”

The students said the special classes were very useful for them. “We feel free to clarify our doubts with the teachers. They are also preparing us for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test,” a student said.

Started in 1962, higher secondary course was introduced in the school in 2001. Today, it has a strength of 300 students. The school benefits tribal villages of Alampalayam, Manalkadu, Kundhamthottam, Viralikadu, Kongadai and Burgur.

224,['31/01/2020'],O Raja assumes charge as chairman of Theni Aavin,"This story is from January 31, 2020

Madurai: A week after the Madras high court bench set aside the appointment of O Raja, brother of deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam, as chairman of the state-run Theni District Milk Producers Co-operative, he assumed charge in the post on Thursday amid fanfare in the presence of minister for milk products and dairy development K T Rajendra Bhalaji. Raja and the minister later said the appointment was made through legal and proper means.

The court had set aside Raja’s appointment, after the division bench comprising Justice T Ravindran and Justice M Duraisamy observed that the board of Theni Aavin had been constituted and chairman appointed invoking the wrong section of the Tamil Nadu Co-operatives Act.

P Ammavasi, president of the Milk Co-operative Union of Palanichettipatti in Theni district, had gone to court against the appointment of Raja as Theni Aavin chairman, as he was already the chairman of the Madurai Aavin. Ammavasi alleged the appointment was done in secrecy and that the members were not elected.

The bench had directed that the Milk Production and Dairy Development Department pass necessary and appropriate orders for the formation of an interim board, or regular board, in accordance with the Tamil Nadu Co-operatives Societies Act, 1983.

It was using this clause that managing director of the Cooperative Milk Producers Federation Dr M Vallalar passed a GO No 1120/52/2020, dated 29.01.2020 appointing O Raja and 17 members as the interim board of the Theni Aavin TID 483.

Speaking to reporters after Raja assumed charge, Rajendra Bhalaji said they had consulted legal experts and the interim board had assumed charge through legal means. He said the board members would hold office for a period of three months, and if their performance was good they might continue.

O Raja told TOI that he and his board had assumed charge through legal and proper means, and that they would soon convene a board meeting and take further decisions.

Telugu Bramhan Seva Sangh in collaboration with some other organisations at Prem Nagar and Gayatri temple at Tulasi Nagar organised samuhika aksharabhyas (mass learning of alphabets) to initiate the kids into studies.

Parents believe their children will be brilliant with the blessings of Saraswati if they start learning alphabets on the occasion of Sri Panchami also known as Basant Panchami.

The mobile tower at Kotia in Koraput's Pottangi block

KORAPUT: In an attempt to strengthen infrastructure at Kotia panchayat under Pottangi block — an area to which both Odisha and Andhra Pradesh claim credit — the state government on Thursday commissioned a BSNL mobile tower.

“Now the area is covered under mobile connectivity which will facilitate quicker flow of information and help in expediting development activities,” Koraput district collector Madhusudan Mishra said.

Kotia residents erupted in joy after getting mobile connectivity, which was a long-standing demand of people in the region. “We are happy to have got mobile connectivity. Now we can call the ambulance, police and district officials at the time of need. We can also talk to our friends and relatives,” said Arjun Gamel, a Kotia resident.

Officials said that special attention is being given towards strengthening infrastructure at Kotia and development projects worth over Rs 55 crore and involving roads, bridge, hospital, education complex are at various stages of completion in the panchayat.

“We have set March 31 as the deadline for the completion of the projects and once they are done, they will boost infrastructure facilities at Kotia,” the collector added.

Project director, district rural development agencies, Prabir Kumar Nayak said apart from the 10-bed hospital, which will cater to the healthcare needs of around 8,000 residents of the panchayat, the state government is constructing a 300-seater hostel for tribal boys and a 200-seater hostel for tribal girls, an education complex, cluster houses for residents under Biju Pucca Ghar Yojana, community centres in some villages and numerous roads in the interiors to resolve connectivity problems of residents to the panchayat headquarters and to the block and district headquarters.

“Furthermore, the state government has identified at least three acres of land for the construction of a police station at Kotia,” Nayak added.

Both the Odisha and Andhra Pradesh governments are engaged in a five-decade-long tug-of-war over the ownership of 21 of the 28 villages in Kotia panchayat. The case is sub-judice in Supreme Court since 1968.

It may be recalled that peeved with frequent intrusions from Andhra officials and various welfare programmes being offered by the neighbouring government to Kotia, the Odisha government had finalised a special package worth Rs 150 crore for the development of the place in April 2018.

The shops were constructed at a cost of Rs 60 lakh

COIMBATORE: Three shops constructed by the city corporation four-and-a-half years ago at Peelamedu are yet to open shutters to the public.

The shops, constructed at a cost of Rs 60 lakh, at the point where VK Road and Pioneer Mill Road meet behind PSG College of Technology , have never been occupied or used even for a short period, say residents and local activists.

“It has been more than four years since the shops were constructed. Initially, corporation officials told us that they will set up an Amma Unavagam there,” said activist and MDMK member SP Velliangiri. “After some months, they said the complex will house a ration shop and a public library apart from the Amma canteen. A year later, they said they will rent it out to private parties. But none of that has happened.”

Patrons of the nearby Tasmac outlet have made the frontage of the shops their hub, said Velliangiri. “They find it a convenient place to have liquor. Political parties stick their posters on the walls of the shops.”

The corporation should rent out the shops to small businesses that will benefit the community, said R Prema Rani, a resident. “The place is ideal to set up a petty shop, grocery shop or a stationary shop. The corporation can also earn a revenue. The civic body spent Rs 60 lakh to construct the shops, only to leave them idle. But corporation officials say they lack funds for new roads and drainage pipelines,” she said.

Madurai: DVAC sleuths arrested the inspector of Parthibanur police station for accepting a bribe of Rs 5,000 from a man to discharge his grandson from a case.

Police said Bhoominathan of Idayayoor Melakudiyiruppu near Parthibanur in Ramanathapuram district was working abroad.

His wife Hemalatha had lodged a complaint against Bhoominathan, his mother and brother-in-law Balakrishnan alleging harassment. Parthibanur police inspector A Rajarajan registered a case against ten people including Balakrishnan in the case.

Later, inspector Rajarajan bargained with Balakrishnan’s grandfather Thangavelu and asked him to give him Rs 20,000 to discharge Balakrishnan from the case.

The first installment of Rs 15,000 was handed over to the inspector. But, as he continued to demand the remaining Rs 5,000, Thangavelu lodged a complaint with Ramanathapuram DVAC.

The DVAC officials, including DSP Unnikrishnan and inspector Peter, who kept a watch on Rajarajan, arrested him when he was receiving Rs 5,000 from Thangavelu at the police station.

COIMBATORE: Evening college students and workers shuttling between Coimbatore and Mettupalayam have a reason to rejoice with the Southern Railway introducing a new night train between the towns.

The new eight-coach train will leave Mettupalayam at 7pm and reach Coimbatore Junction at 7.50pm. It will stop at Karamadai at 7.09pm, Periyanaickenpalayam at 7.17pm, Thudiyalur at 7.24pm and Coimbatore North Junction at 7.29pm. It will again leave Coimbatore Junction at 8.25pm and reach Mettupalayam at 9.15pm, with stops at Coimbatore North at 8.31pm, Thudiyalur at 8.36pm, Periyanaickenpalayam at 8.41pm and Karamadai at 8.52pm.

The new service is in addition to the four MEMU train services between Coimbatore and Mettupalayam — which leave at 9.30am, 11.50pm, 3.25pm and 5.55pm — and the Nilgiris Express.

Railway authorities said that the additional service will also help to handle the extra rush of tourists travelling to and from the NMR destinations.

The last train to Mettupalayam used to depart from Coimbatore at 5.55pm, to the chagrin of regular commuters, who finish work only around 5.30pm.

Haritha R, who works in a clothing store at Race Course, said her shift gets over only at 7.30pm, which makes it impossible for her to get a train to Mettupalayam. “So, I end up taking bus, which are crowded. Also, I have to take a town bus from Race Course to the Mettupalayam New Bus Stand,” she said. “Buses are also a lot more expensive with a ticket costing Rs 20.”

231,['31/01/2020'],"Saamna backs Centre on JNU student Imam, says chop off his hands","This story is from January 31, 2020

Mumbai: Saamna , the Shiv Sena mouthpiece, on Thursday tore into anti-citizenship law protester Sharjeel Imam ’s “inflammatory and anti-national” statement and supported the government’s crackdown on him, raising fears of discord in the government it runs along with NCP and Congress.

Saamna said Imam’s hands should be chopped off and hung up on the 22km highway — the ‘chicken’s neck’—that links the NE with the rest of India.

JNU student Imam was arrested on Tuesday for sedition and other charges.

Calling on the Centre to crush the “pest” of separatism, it wondered if there was a well-planned plot to “poison” the minds of students. “Imam is an IIT-Mumbai alumni ... This is a conspiracy to plant separatism (in the mind of the educated people) and take them on the path of extremism,” said the Saamna editorial. “The conspiracy is to perpetuate Hindu-Muslim disharmony and a prolonged civil war... Urban Naxalism is very much on. Add to this, the extremism of intellectuals which is being fanned by politicians,” it added.

This stand can bring Sena into direct conflict with Congress, which has been pro-active in the anti-CAA, -NRC protests, and NCP, which claims the Elgar Parishad case was foisted on intellectuals and activists and wants it quashed.

Urging the Centre not to indulge in a political game, Saamna endorsed Amit Shah’s statement that Imam’s ‘chicken neck’ remark was more dangerous than Kanhaiyya Kumar’s ‘freedom’ utterances and that Imam’s next seven generations will not succeed in cutting the Northeast from the country.

Sharpening the Sena versus BJP narrative, the Union home ministry had transferred the Elgar Parishad probe to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) right after Sharad Pawar’s letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray seeking an SIT on the case. Nine suspects, dubbed ‘urban Naxals’ were detained by Pune police for their alleged links with the banned CPI (Maoist).

“While NCP has thrown its weight behind the intellectuals, Saamna has stated the intellectual class, misled by politicians, is taking to anti-national activities. This could trigger tension in the MVA government,” said a former bureaucrat.

The editorial also reflects Sena’s anxiety over an MNS morcha planned on February 9 to demand immediate eviction of illegal Bangladeshis from Mumbai. There have been reports of MNS and BJP cosying up, and Sena strategists are worried that MNS backed by BJP may dent it with an aggressive anti-Bangladeshi stance. After recent talks between Raj Thackeray and former CM Devendra Fadnavis, BJP’s Ashish Shelar called on Raj on Wednesday.

Madurai: Helmet and seatbelt violations witnessed a massive jump in 2019 with the Madurai district police registering about 2.33 lakh cases and a total Rs 2.33 crore collected as fine from the offenders. The violations is 153% higher when compared to 2018

Two-wheeler riders coughed up Rs 1.62 crore as fine for not wearing helmet, with the rural police registering 1,62,759 helmet rule violation cases, while Rs 71 lakh was collected as fine from nearly 71,000 people who were booked for not wearing seat belt in 2019. In 2018, only 92,267 cases were registered for not wearing helmet and seat belt. Officials said that the registration of more number of helmet rule violation cases played a vital role in bringing down the road fatalities considerably in 2019. While 330 road deaths were recorded in 2018, it came down to 282 in 2019, a decrease by 14.5%.

District superintendent of police N Manivannan said that most deaths in two-wheeler accidents are caused because of head injuries. Stringent enforcement of the helmet rule helped them bring the death rate last year. While police will continue to book helmet rule violators, he urged the commuters to wear helmets.

Usilampatti police range recorded the highest number of 39,000 helmet cases among six ranges in the district. It was followed by Samayanallur with around 34,000, Thirumangalam with 30,500, Peraiyur and Oomachikulam with around 21,000 each. Melur range recorded the least number with 16,600 cases.

A police officer from the district police unit said that regular checks are being carried out in all important roads, junctions and towns. “Bikers should wear helmet irrespective of distance, since no one can predict accidents. Accidents can also take place in village roads and one should be prepared,” he said. The district police are planning to bring down the road fatalities in 2020 further by conducting more sensitization programmes. In 2019, about 5,000 sensitization programmes were carried out and this year they are planning to to double it.

VADODARA: He dresses up as a clown and visits patients and children at hospitals to amuse and encourage those suffering from cancer. Now, this Bengaluru-based Barodian has joined hands with an organization to start cancer support groups in six cities of the country.

The cancer support circles will be launched on February 4 that marks World Cancer Day . Harish Bhuvan, who had embarked on the journey of spreading smiles a couple of years back, has joined hands with Onco.com, country’s first internet aggregator for cancer care.

“We will be conducting cancer support groups throughout the week covering six different cities on six different dates,” said Bhuvan, who had earlier launched ‘Compassionate clowns’ that conducts clowning events at hospitals. The cancer support groups will be launched at Mumbai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Delhi, Ahmedabad and Bengaluru between February 3 and 8.

This year, world cancer day is themed on ‘I Am and I Will’ campaign. “The campaign is aimed at promoting dialogues around cancer. What a better way to do that than starting cancer support groups, a concept popular in developed countries,” said 30-year-old Bhuvan, adding that the cancer support groups are named ‘Talk Your Heart Out’.

Bhuvan, who has completed his bachelor of arts degree in psychology from Christ University , has so far done 12 cancer support circles including 11 in Bengaluru and one in New Delhi touching around 100 individuals.

After graduating, Bhuvan had taken up a job as an educational researcher at Bengaluru but left it to continue clowning.

“Cancer patients receive support from their families and friends. But what about the caregivers, their mental health. With every circle, we realize that everybody has a story to share,” said Bhuvan, who has created a team of hundreds of volunteers who regularly visit hospitals, care centres and cancer treatment centres to spread happiness.

Puducherry: A day after rebel Congress MLA N Dhanavelu, who was suspended from the party, submitted a memorandum to lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi levelling corruption charges against chief minister V Narayanasamy and his cabinet colleagues, government whip R K R Anantharaman on Thursday urged V P Sivakolundhu, speaker of the legislative assembly, to disqualify Dhanavelu on charges of attempting to topple the Congress government in the Union territory.

Anantharaman, accompanied by Congress MLAs, called on the speaker at his chambers in the assembly and submitted a petition in this regard. Later speaking to the media, Anantharaman said as the government whip he urged the speaker to disqualify Dhanavelu under the provisions of the anti-defection act as the rebel MLA has been attempting to topple the Congress government with the help of opposition members.

“We have also furnished enough material evidence against the MLA on his efforts to topple the Congress government,” Anantharaman said.

He pointed out that the MLA led a procession against the Congress government and called on Bedi on Wednesday and submitted a memorandum levelling corruption charges against the Congress dispensation in Puducherry and urged her to ‘put an end to this rule’.

A Namassivayam, Puducherry Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president, told reporters that Dhanavelu, despite being elected on a Congress ticket, continued to resort to anti-party activities. He said the PPCC suspended him after consulting the high command and issued him a show-cause notice.

“He (Dhanavelu) submitted his reply to the notice. But, he continued to target the party publicly. He joined hands with the opposition parties and called on the lieutenant governor and requested her to remove the government, which invites stern action under Anti-Defection Act,” Namassivayam said.

The PPCC president maintained that there is no threat to the government.

“There is no threat to the government. Congress-DMK alliance is very strong and the Congress government will complete its five-year term,” he said.

Brushing aside the corruption charges raised by the rebel MLA against the chief minister and his cabinet colleagues, Namassivayam said not only the CM but every elected member will resign if the charges are proved.

Margao: Voicing his opposition to CAA, Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao Thursday said that the “unconstitutional” Act was a prelude to NRC which he claimed would spell trouble to 70 percent of overseas Goans.

Stating that his support to the BJP government was only because of chief minister Pramod Sawant as he hails from the “weaker section of society”, Alemao said it has always been issue-based.

Explaining the rationale behind his anti-CAA stance, Alemao said, “As they say, give them an inch and they will take a mile. If CAA is allowed to happen, NRC will definitely follow.”

Elaborating on his concerns, Alemao, while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an event at Ravindra Bhavan here, said, “Today there's Brexit happening. Goans there don't know what to do. If they go to Portugal, they will have no jobs. So then they will come to Goa. With no (citizenship) registration, they will lose everything. Do we want this to happen?” TNN

WII

Dehradun: With an aim to impart skills for job in environment conservation, the Wildlife Institute of India ( WII ) announced initiation of a special training for people interested in receiving education related to wildlife.

A meeting was held at WII on Thursday wherein people from all walks of life from across the country participated to learn the skills required for bird identification, especially migratory birds of India. The programme is being conducted under the aegis of the Union environment ministry.

Over 500 people showed keen interest to participate in the “Green Skill Development Programme” (GSDP) course which started on Thursday and will continue for a fortnight at WII.

The programme witnessed participation from Ladakh, Assam, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Mizoram, and Maharashtra. These participants will be taught “Bird Identification” and “Basic Ornithology”, so that they can become self-dependent and create employment opportunities.

""In our eco-system, everything is inter-dependent and wildlife is directly linked to nature. Hence, we are trying to look at each possible segment through which we can provide knowledge and increase opportunities of jobs for the country’s youth,"" said Dhananjai Mohan, WII director.

The institute has commenced the project especially for the people residing in and around protected areas so they can contribute to forest and wildlife conservation.

“The Environment Information System (ENVIS) Centre at Wildlife Institute of India has taken the initiative to start an academic course in nature interpretation for rural youth in protected areas to enable them to become nature guides. These people are emotionally connected to their areas and hence, we prefer to educate them and impart skills among them to create a win-win situation,” said K Sivakumar, senior scientist and ENVIS Coordinator at WII. Prior to this programme, three more courses have been held in different places of India under ENVIS.

The first such course was started in Manas Tiger Reserve, Assam, followed by a course on “Nature Conservation and Livelihood: River Based Ganga Prahari” in Sarnath, Uttar Pradesh and a Certificate Course in “Nature Interpretation for Large Zoos and Safari Parks: Zoo Guide Training Programme” in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.

“India is the second most populated country in the world and there exists a demand-supply gap of skill sets (both cognitive and practical) at various levels in environment/forest sector in India.

“Green skills are crucial for cleaner and greener production and service patterns. It prepares people for green jobs that contribute to preserving and restoring environment while simultaneously improving social equity and enhancing quality of life,” added Sivakumar.

Representative image

MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday raided the residences and offices of builder Sudhakar Shetty in connection with a money laundering case involving the late drug smuggler Iqbal Memon, alias Mirchi, and the promoters of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd ( DHFL ).

The raid continued till late in the night.

Shetty, who once owned the infamous Deepa dance bar at Vile Parle (West), entered the construction business over a decade ago under the name Sahana Group and is presently developing several big-ticket projects in the city in partnership with prominent builders. He owns a helicopter, runs a TV news channel and is close to several senior politicians.

Despite several attempts by TOI, Shetty remained unavailable for comment.

The Enforcement Directorate suspects that Shetty was a conduit for DHFL’s money.

Sources said that during the money laundering investigation, the ED learnt that DHFL promoters Kapil Wadhawan and his brother Dheeraj, aka Baba Diwan, had bought three buildings from Mirchi in 2010 through their front company Sunblink for Rs 111 crore. Baba paid Rs 154 crore more to Mirchi, abroad, through his company in Dubai. The ED suspects that the Wadhawans, along with others, siphoned off Rs 12,773 crore from DHFL with the help of 79 shadowy entities and 1 lakh fictitious accounts through dubious transactions and used a part of the sum to clear the payment due to Mirchi.

The ED claimed to have found a financial link between the companies they are probing in the Mirchi-DHFL case and Shetty. During the raid on Shetty’s premises, the ED collected several documents and digital records of his companies and their financial transactions.

On Monday, the ED arrested Kapil Wadhawan, who told officials he was unaware about the questionable transactions. One of his company’s officials, during questioning, had told the ED that all dubious transactions happened at Wadhawan’s instance. The ED had called a former director of DHFL to confront Wadhawan on Thursday, but this couldn’t materialize as Wadhawan complained that he was unwell. He was taken to JJ Hospital and admitted there after he was examined by his personal physician (H1N1 is suspected).

Mathur observed that adoption of Japanese technology would help reduce intensity of greenhouse gas emissions in the industrial sector, help the energy intensive small and medium enterprises (SME) sector, besides bridging the gap between power supply and demand. Adoption of energy efficient technology can reduce greenhouse gas emission in the industrial sector by up to 33-35% by 2030, he added. “We will request IGES to select a cluster in AP for a deep-dive intervention. We would be happy if the APSECM (AP State Energy Conservation Mission) and energy department agree to partner us in the initiative and provide logistical support to the project,” Mathur said.

The speakers urged MLAs Churchill Alemao and Vijai Sardesai to raise the issue in the assembly.

MARGAO: Noted environmental activists Claude Alvares and Ramesh Gawas on Thursday lent their voices to castigate the central government at an anti-CAA protest meeting held at Margao, even as the large number of people gathered were called on to join a protest march to the state legislative assembly on February 3 , the first day of the Assembly session.

“...And if needed we won’t allow the assembly sesison to be held,” said activist Rama Kankonkar . He urged the two MLAs present at the meeting – Churchill Alemao and Vijai Sardesai – not to attend the Assembly and to join the protesters instead. Another speaker, Iftikar Shaikh urged the MLAs to raise the issue in the Assembly. Chairperson of Margao Municipal Council Pooja Naik was also present at the meeting.

While Gawas said that the CAA/NRC/NPR was part of the larger goal of “Hindu Rashtra” as propounded by RSS second sarsanghchalak M S Golwalkar, Alvares warned that deportation of Muslims on grounds of failure to produce citizenship documents would happen “only over our dead bodies.”

“The concept of making Bharat a Hindu Rashtra has been an integral part of RSS ideology since 1925. As regards Muslims, Golwalkar wrote in his book ‘Vichar Dhan’ that if Muslims wished to stay in India, they should do so as secondary citizens. The government’s moves are in furtherance of the same ideology,” Gawas said.

Alvares accused prime minister Narendra Modi of “assaulting” the Constitution of India by bringing in the CAA. “An amendment to the Citizenship Act has for the first time excluded Muslims from the Constitution. And therefore more than 150 writ petitions have been filed in the court on the grounds that it is violating the Constitution of India,” Alvares said, adding that the CAA was also against the secular credentials of the nation.

Fr Savio Fernandes of the Council for Social Justice and Peace, the co-organiser of the meeting, accused the government of trying to drive a wedge into society by launching an attack on the Constitution.

Subhash Desai visit waste processing unit in Aurangabad on Thursday

AURANGABAD: During his visit to Kanchanwadi sewage treatment plant, district guardian minister Subhash Desai on Thursday said that it is mandatory for industries to use 40% recycled sewage water of their total usage.

Desai, who is also the industries minister, reviewed the operations of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation’s Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) at Kanchanwadi.

Municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey, who was also present at the site, explained the features of the plant to the minister. Pandey said that with the capacity to treat 161 million litres of sewage per day, the sewage treatment plant at Kanchanwadi is the largest facility in the state barring the one coming up at Navi Mumbai.

The plant was built at Aurangabad under Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns (UIDSSMT) of the Government of India.

Currently, the plant is treating 60 million litres of sewage generated by the city on a daily basis. The sewage is brought to the plant via the underground drainage system, Pandey told Desai. He said that post treatment, the water is released into the Kham river.

An official of Khillari Infrastructure, the agency operating the plant, showed a sample of the treated sewage to Desai. The water collected in a transparent beaker visibly appeared clean.

Desai asked the official if the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) made use of the treated water. Responding to Desai, Pandey said that he has instructed all the major construction projects in the city to strictly use recycled water and has included it as a criterion to secure a completion certificate.

Desai announced that the industries around the state will be provided 40% less water from the dams and instead they will have to suffice the said amount of their water needs with the water treated at STPs. “This measure will help to address the water crisis in the state,” Desai said.

Representative image

AURANGABAD: The state anti-corruption bureau ( ACB ) — getting strict with public servants and people representatives being probed for disproportionate assets (DPA) —has decided to register cheating and forgery cases if the suspects are found submitting forged records for their assets.

A decision in this regard was taken during the crime review meeting of the state ACB headed by directorate general of police (DGP) Param Bir Singh in Mumbai earlier this week.

During the meeting it was found that on several occasions the suspect government servants are found submitting forged records to show that their wives took tuition classes or owned beauty parlour or claim to have earned several lakhs from farming.

An officer, who attended the meeting, said these are the most common sources of income shown by spouses of the suspect public servants. In DPA cases, probe is carried out in two stages — discreet and open.

Discreet inquiry is carried out to find if there is any substance in the allegations against the said public servant amassing wealth more than his known sources of income.

After finding substantial records, an offence is registered and an open inquiry is initiated, during which the suspect is asked to submit all documentary records to prove that his assets are the result of legitimate income.

While doing so, the suspect submits records, which if found to be irrelevant or fake, were rejected by the ACB. Henceforth, it has been decided that additional sections would be slapped if fake records are submitted.

When contacted, superintendent of police (ACB) Arvind Chawria said, “It has been decided that additional sections of cheating, forgery would be added to the existing case if any government servant is found submitting fake or forged records to justify his claims about making assets from known sources of income.”

Not only the credentials of all submitted records would be cross-checked, but also the department concerned, issuing receipts to such suspects, will have to officially certify the documents. These departments will also be held accountable if any forged receipt is issued.

The officer, citing the standard operating procedure followed during DPA inquiries, said cost of things as petty as footwears to tables, furniture, mobile phones, and so on in the suspect’s house in taken into account.

Everything, including cost of children’s education, jewellery, cross-verification of the returns filed with income tax, all declared and undeclared assets are taken on record with the help of multiple government agencies, before auditing his salary from day he joined the service.

Thiruvananthapuram: Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan has said the incident that took place in the assembly on Wednesday when governor Arif Mohammed Khan had come to address the House was “most unfortunate”.

On Wednesday, the governor, accompanied by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan , the speaker and parliamentary minister A K Balan, had to wait for a few minutes inside the well of the House as the Congress-led opposition members blocked their passage. The opposition members were then forcibly removed by the watch and ward staff of the assembly.

The speaker, however, ruled out any action against the opposition members who had blocked the governor.

Sreeramakrishnan made it clear that only the prepared text of the governor’s address will feature in the assembly documents. “Whatever the governor has said outside the prepared text will not be there in the documents. What the cabinet approved is the prepared text of the speech made by the governor in the House. Hence, only that will go into the assembly records,” the speaker said. The governor had said on Wednesday that he was reading out the paragraph as requested by the chief minister, though he had his own reservations. “I have been corresponding with the chief minister on the matter for the last few days. I disagree with the government view, but I will read to honour his request,” Khan had said.

The speaker said that the opposition had lodged a complaint against the watch and ward staff entering the House. “A decision on this will be taken soon,” he said.

On the notice moved by opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala to pass a resolution urging President Ram Nath Kovind to recall the governor, the speaker said: “The business advisory committee meeting of the assembly will take a decision on this notice.”

“As per the rules, the notice given by the opposition leader is valid. But, whether it has to be admitted in the House for discussion or not has to be decided during the meeting of the business advisory committee,” Sreeramakrishnan added.

TimesView It is important to set a policy and then stick to it; and this policy should be uniform for all areas. Too many frequent changes and climbdowns can encourage violations of law.

KOLKATA: Some have fallen in line. But many others continue to play truant. A section of hawkers in Esplanade-New Market belt has removed the plastic sheets they had strung up over their stalls as shade after mayor Firhad Hakim issued a warning a fortnight ago. But a majority of them in Gariahat and Hatibagan continue to defy him and use plastic that are both an eyesore and a fire hazard.It was hawkers in Esplanade who took off the plastic sheets after Hakim issued a stern warning. KMC had made several pleas before. But they had been of no avail till Hakim issued a stern warning 15 days ago, calling for the removal of all plastic sheets from hawking zones. Pointing out that the monsoon had long passed, the mayor had said the sheets not only posed fire threat, they also allowed dust to settle on them, thereby causing pollution.While hawkers in Esplanade area were the first to oblige and took off plastic sheets last week, those doing business on the pavements in New Market-Lindsay Street stretch followed suit. Hawkers in Bertram Street, Humayun Place and Lindsay Street also removed the plastic cover after cops from local New Market police station conducted a couple of raids.According to Mohammed Irfan, a hawker who sells ready-made garment at Grand Arcade, they were compelled to take off the plastic sheets following a warning from the civic bosses. “A team of officials from the KMC headquarters asked us to remove plastics or face the consequences. Cops from New Market also reminded us about the civic action. Thinking of a punitive action we decided to remove plastic materials from around our space,” he said.Though a section of New Market traders welcomed the move, they pointed out that hawkers continue to pile the plastic sheets at the main entry points to the heritage market at night and posed a threat to the entire market. “If there is a fire at night, the entire market will get burnt down. We have brought it to the notice of authorities time and again but to no avail,” said Uday Sahoo, a shop-owner and functionary of the SS Hogg Market Traders’ Association.At Gariahat, the scene remains unchanged with grimy plastic sheets covering the stalls that occupy half the pavement width. A section of businessman said though plastic sheets had been taken off in the run-up to Durga Puja, they returned shortly after.“Though hawkers were asked to remove plastics after KMC began distributing stalls, most hawkers have not moved into them and continue to do business the old way,” said traders who owns a garment shop. Ratan Dhar, one of the few hawkers who had removed the plastic sheet over his stall, said he put them back again when he saw that no one had complied.At Hatibagan, too, compliance is poor with over 80% hawkers still using plastics sheets. “KMC market department has asked us to remove plastic materials. But, we need some more time,” said Swapan Mondal, a hawker who sells cosmetic items.A senior official in the KMC market department said after mayor Firhad Hakim ordered removal of plastics from hawkers’ markets, the civic body was in touch with local police stations to assist the civic official implement the plastic ban.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73797315,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-48319,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/plastic-covers-stay-in-hatibagan-gariahat-even-after-mayor-diktat/articleshow/73781799.cms

Ajit Pawar

AURANGABAD: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Wednesday expressed doubts about the financial feasibility of the ambitious water grid project . Citing expert opinion, he said that even if the project is executed, thousands of crores will have to be paid as electricity bills for the same.

Pawar said though this government does not have the mindset to scrap the projects, there are contradictory views amongst the experts. He pointed out that during the previous government’s tenure too, some experts, and even government officials, had tried to explain the same — but their views were ignored. “How can a project be executed, when it is not feasible?” Pawar asked.

His statement is being looked upon as the first step towards the scrapping of the water grid project.

Pawar went on to state that even the Mumbai-based Hyperloop project is like the water grid project. He said as per the expert opinion, both the projects are not feasible. Speaking about the Hyperloop project, he said: “It is a project that no one has experimented with before. There is a serious question about should public money be spent on such projects.”

He said the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation had an outstanding power bill of Rs 100 crore for the water supply project. He, however, clarified that his words should not be taken as if the incumbent government was scrapping all the projects initiated by the previous government.

Pawar skipped answering questions on if the water grid project would be allocated funds in the upcoming state budget. He said even if a project does is not mentioned in the budget, it can be added as a supplementary demand during monsoon or winter sessions.

When asked about the allocation of funds for Jalyukt Shivar, Pawar said that there are questions about the success of this project.

The deputy CM was in the city for a review meeting of the planning committees in the region.

Representative image

AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad bench of Bombay High Court has imposed a cost of Rs 5,000 on a petitioner for misusing the remedy of public interest litigation ( PIL ) in settling a matter that is already being heard by a civil court.

The petitioner, Rameshwar Baburao Suryawanshi, claiming to be president of RTI Karyakarta Manch, Latur, had filed a PIL in the HC seeking directives to the government authorities for cancellation of two sale deeds on land carried out in the year 2016.

The petitioner stated that based on the application of one Baburao Mallappa Takale, the then tehsildar of Nilangan in January 1994 allotted him a portion of government land. “In violation of the terms laid down by the revenue authorities, the man allegedly indulged in illegal transfer of land.”

Assistant government pleader SP Sonpawle represented the state and pointed out that the matter was already pending before appropriate civil court.

The division bench of the HC comprising Justices Prasanna Varale and Anil Kilor observed: “The petitioner is seeking direction in respect of certain land property which is already a subject matter before the competent civil court and as such, it is our clear opinion that this petition is nothing but a misuse of the remedy of public interest litigation.”

Though the petitioner has claimed to be an RTI activist, the HC observed: “Nowhere it is stated in the petition that this document is obtained by taking recourse to Right to Information Act. There is not a single word in the petition to show the source of this document.”

The HC further said that on the one hand, the petitioner has submitted the record showing that the matter is pending before the civil court while on the other, he has stated on oath that there is no civil or criminal proceedings filed or going on which could have legal nexus with the issue involved in the public interest litigation.

The HC cited a series of flaws in the PIL and concluded that the “PIL is thoroughly meritless and deserves to be dismissed at the threshold with imposition of costs on the petitioner for misusing the remedy.”

The petitioner failed to mention his source of livelihood in the petition, following which the HC specifically inquired about. On learning that farming is his source of livelihood, the court ruled: “Considering the source of livelihood of the petitioner, we deem it appropriate to impose costs of Rs 5,000 upon the petitioner.”

Dehradun: The state forest department has decided to rehabilitate the Van Gujjars in Chillawali range of Rajaji Tiger Reserve (RTR) and nearby areas. In the first phase, around 28 families (out of 104 identified families) will be rehabilitated in the Pathri and Gaindi Khata area where some forest dwellers already live. The department has plans to give out existing forest plots to these dwellers. These would be the plots which were either abandoned or sold by forest dwellers despite not having the right to sell forest land.

Another site at Shahmansur in Khanpur range has also been identified for relocating the remaining Van Gujjar families. It is being planned that forest dwellers will be given 1 acre land and Rs 5 lakh per family. A proposal for the same will be prepared by RTR director to send to state government. “Van Gujjars are integral part of our forests and we cannot throw them out to suffer. We have directed RTR officials to form their society so that they have registered GST number and related documents. This will help us provide them with maximum possible forest department jobs,” said Jairaj, head of forest force, Uttarakhand.

Uttarakhand has around 5,000 Van Gujjar families, as per forest department data. Most of these families claim to be inhabitants of RTR and Corbett reserve. The forest department is planning to conduct an in-depth survey to get adequate details and rehabilitate these Van Gujjars.

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday stayed the Madras high court proceedings on a petition challenging the election of DMK leader Kanimozhi Karunanidhi from Tuticorin constituency.

A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde took note of the submissions of the DMK leader’s lawyer and stayed the high court proceedings.

“Having heard counsel appearing for the parties, we direct that until further orders, the operation of impugned judgment and order dated November 19, 2019 passed by the high court of judicature at Madras in original application nos...in election petition no.3 of 2019 and the further proceedings in election petition shall remain stayed,” said the bench which comprised justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant.

The bench has now posted the plea filed by the DMK leader against the high court order for further hearing after four weeks.

Kanimozhi contested from the Tuticorin constituency in 2019 and her election was challenged by a voter, A Sanathana Kumar, on the grounds that she failed to mention her husband’s permanent account number (PAN) in her election affidavit disclosing family assets.

The Madras high court had earlier rejected the plea of Kanimozhi seeking dismissal of two election petitions filed by the voter and a BJP leader separately challenging her election to the Lok Sabha.

The election petition should necessarily be taken to its logical end, it had said.

While dismissing Kanimozhi's plea, the high court had said that the election petitioner must be given a chance to marshal evidence to prove his claim of improper acceptance of nomination.

The DMK leader had said her husband was an NRI living in Singapore and he neither possessed a PAN card nor does he pay any income tax in India.

Kanimozhi had defeated her nearest rival Tamilisai Soundararajan (now governor of Telangana) of BJP. Another plea challenging the election of Kanimozhi was filed by Soundararajan, who withdrew the plea after becoming governor of Telangana.

A Muthuramalingam, a local BJP leader, has substituted Soundararajan as a party in the high court. PTI

Madurai: The Madras high court has directed the state government to file a counter on a plea seeking an interim stay on the amendment to Section 16 of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2019 which made it compulsory for children of Classes V and VIII to undergo state-level public examinations.

The petition came up for hearing before a division bench comprising justice M Duraisamy and justice T Ravindran. In his petition, S Louis, said that public examinations for the classes V and VIII is wholly unwarranted and not conducted in any other state this academic year.

He said the impugned amendment Section 16 of the Act and consequential impugned government order (GO) dated September 13, 2019 is highly arbitrary and violative of Article 21 A of the Indian Constitution.

The state level public examinations for classes V and VIII at the end of every academic year and conducting re-examination after a period of two months for those who failed is nothing but a harassment to the children at their tender age which would result in giving up further learning.

Collection of examination free of Rs 100 for Class V and Rs 200 for the Class VIII is against the fundamental right of free and compulsory education provided under Article 21A of the Constitution.

The bench directed the state government to file a counter and adjourned the case to a further date for hearing.

Ashok Chavan

AURANGABAD: Public works department (PWD) minister and Congress functionary Ashok Chavan on Thursday came down heavily on former minister Sudhir Mungantiwar for stating that Shiv Sena is their natural partner and the option for forming government with the BJP is still open.

Chavan on Thursday took a review meeting of the works being carried out by the PWD in the region. After conclusion of the marathon meeting, the former chief minister attended a couple of events organized by the local unit of the Congress.

During an interaction with the journalists, Chavan said he (Mungantiwar) thinks he is still in government. “His statement that BJP and Shiv Sena are trying to form a government again is a distant dream. Mungantiwar has a habit of dreaming, but our government is working smoothly,” he added.

Being asked about controversial statements of Maha Vikas Aghadi , Chavan said, “Those who are part of the alliance should avoid giving statements that may lead to controversy. It is a good thing that Jitendra Awhad has taken back his statement over Indira Gandhi.”

Awhad, an NCP functionary, on Wednesday had said that Indira Gandhi implemented emergency and tried to suppress democracy. This led to sharp criticism from state Congress and soon Awhad withdrew his comments.

AURANGABAD: A senior inspector serving with Nanded police will be denied a year’s increment as punishment for visiting Vietnam to study guerilla warfare without obtaining permission from higher-ups.

Nanded superintendent of police Vijaykumar Magar on Wednesday issued the order against the senior PI, Pandit Kachve , on cancellation of annual increment.

“There are standing orders from the state police headquarters that any police personnel going on a foreign tour should obtain prior permission and clearance from the appropriate authorities. The officer violated the norms and accordingly he has been punished,” Magar told TOI.

When contacted, Kachve, who is currently heading the Nanded rural police station, said it was his personal trip and he paid for it. “Being a history student, I am keen on doing PhD on the subject. I went to Vietnam for three days for studying guerilla warfare. Going on a foreign tour without prior permission was my mistake and I have confessed to it before our unit commander,” he said.

In May-June 2019, Kachve availed of leave for seven days and went on a personal tour to Vietnam. It was after he returned to Nanded and resumed duty, his photos of the foreign visit went viral on social media and also published by some vernacular newspapers.

Activists working under the banner of ‘public welfare anti-corruption committee’ took note of the visit and lodged a written complaint with the superintendent of police, who initiated a probe against the senior PI.

Taking cognizance of the newspaper reports, A memo was issued to the officer and simultaneously a show-cause asking why action should not be initiated against him.

Police sources informed that during the internal probe, the seniors inspector admitted to have gone on a foreign tour without prior clearance from higher-ups, following which the punishment was awarded to him.

Hyderabad: Many startups who presented their innovations at the Ink@Wash event not only devised solutions for water, sanitation and solid waste issues but also focused on improving the work conditions for sanitation workers, who they claim are the largest informal force that India has.

On the first day of Ink@Wash, a platform that promoting innovations in WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) areas, as many as 11 startups presented their innovations. While many startups devised solutions for recycling waste, water conservation and cleanliness, several also showed their worked on employment models which can empower the sanitation sector.

A city-based start-up, Banyan Nation, had mapped the kabbadiwalas (rag-pickers) in Hyderabad in order to streamline waste management mechanism in the city. “In Hyderabad, we found that there were four recyclers for every kilometre. For every 250 households, there is one dedicated recycler. We have mapped the kabbadiwalas and integrated the supply chain,” said Banyan Nation direstior, Rashi Agarwal. She added that India has one of the largest networks of waste-pickers which can be streamlined and monetised using innovative technologies.

Similarly, Hasiru Dala Innovations claimed that it had fostered entrepreneurship among waste-pickers by providing them waste management services. “While there is a lot of discussion over devising solutions in WASH areas, governments rarely talk about those collecting and/or segregating waste. We offer fixed salaries, incentives and a network to the waste-pickers for collecting, segregating and recycling of waste,” said co-founder of Hasiru Dala Innovations, Shekhar Prabhakar.

PUNE: Fatalities because of accidents on highways passing through the rural parts of the district showed a marginal dip in 2019, but the number was high enough despite police stepping up measures to arrest the nearly four-year trend.After registering the highest fatalities on the highways across the state in 2016, 2017 and 2018 (see graphic), the Pune rural police recorded 855 such deaths last year — the second highest in Maharashtra.The police said a large number of state and national highways, along an expressway, passed through their jurisdiction and most of the accidents on these roads occurred during early morning hours.Superintendent of police (Pune rural) Sandip Patil said “The district has a vast network of national and state highways and it is not possible to monitor all. We have, however, prepared some focused plans to reduce accidents and fatalities on the highways.”He told TOI, “We started a traffic branch at each police station last year. Each branch has a staff of 15 personnel and an officer. They have a patrolling vehicle to man the highways passing through their respective jurisdictions.”At the same time, the Pune rural police claimed to have taken action against motorists violating the road rules. “The main focus was on motorists taking the wrong side of the roads. We also repaired several punctures illegally created along various highways,” Patil said.The officer added that the Pune rural police were working in coordination with Highway Safety Patrol (HSP) officers to ensure safety on the state and national highways.An HSP officer said with the introduction of the interceptor vehicles, the police have managed to keep a check on speeding and rash driving. “We have taken action against over 1200 people for speeding and rash driving in two months. There are a few infrastructure issues related to the highways and the police have discussed the issues with the authorities concerned,” he said.“The Pune rural police and HSP authorities have in the past one year stepped up the heat on people resorting driving in a drunken condition,” he added.City-based traffic activist Ranjit Gadgil said the police must focus on ways to stop speeding on the highways. “The intensity of the accidents on the highways is high and speed is the major reason. The accident casualties have come down by 17%. It can be further reduced if there’s a check on speeding,” he said.Frequent accidents on the Pune-Mumbai expressway had prompted the state traffic police last year to reduce the maximum speed limit of vehicles from 120 kmph to 100 kmph. The Centre had through a notification in April 2018 enhanced the speed limit from 80 kmph to 120 kmph. The enhanced speed limit was implemented in the middle of 2019.The notification had stated that a review of road accidents in Maharashtra revealed that 30% of the fatal accidents occurred because of “over speeding”. It added that no cognisance of the violation of the speed limits should be taken under Section 183 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 , if the speed detected was within 5% of the maximum notified speed.Gadgil said the government agencies must fix the black spots on the highways, where accidents are a routine. “I think the enforcement of the traffic rules in the rural parts of the district was better in 2019 than the previous years and such an initiative should continue,” he said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73796599,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-674092,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/accident-fatalities-on-rural-highway-stretches-a-worry/articleshow/73781841.cms

HYDERABAD: Two weeks after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) arrested Leonia Resorts MD GS Chakravarthy Raju for fraud , key witnesses have claimed that they are being threatened with ‘acid attack’ by a group of miscreants.

Cyberabad police booked two separate FIRs under criminal intimidation and trespass sections of IPC against three persons, who allegedly threatened the witnesses.

On January 15, ED officials arrested Raju for diverting public money obtained through bank loans.

Also, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has booked three FIRs against Raju and others. Raju is in judicial remand now.

In the FIRs, complainant D Chandrashekar Reddy and D Chitta Reddy residents of Shamirpet explained how on January 10 the ED conducted search operations and obtained their signature as ‘panch’ (material) witnesses and seized documents. ED officials gathered information about the diversion of funds and benami transactions on whom the properties were purchased with the diverted funds.

Complainant D Chandrasekhar Reddy identified CH Krishna Reddy, D Krishna Reddy, D Sudhakar Reddy and S Srinivas Reddy as close associates in connection with the benami transactions. Now, Chandrasekhar Reddy says unidentified people are frequenting his house in the village, and also put some anti-social elements on his trail.

“They are threatening to eliminate me for giving information and standing as a panch witness. D Sudhakar Reddy and CH Krishna scolded me in unparliamentary language and threatening that they will throw acid on my family and eliminate us,” Reddy said. The complainant said that he and his family are in danger.

“Anything happens to me… GS Chakravarthy Raju and his associates are responsible,” he said.

So far, the ED investigation has revealed that Raju and other accused of Leonia Resorts floated 33 shell companies in the name of employees and diverted the funds. ED said that the total outstanding loan amount defaulted by the accused and his company stood at Rs 1,768 crore.

ED said that money from Leo Meridian Infrastructure Projects & Hotels Limited is diverted to the shell companies based in Kolkata.

The Enforcement Directorate in December 2019 had attached assets worth Rs 250 crore of the accused.

Cyberabad police booked two separate FIRs under criminal intimidation and trespass sections of IPC against three persons, who allegedly threatened the witnesses. The complainant said he was being threatened as he became a material witness during an ED raid on January 10

HYDERABAD: In its efforts to track illegal water connections, Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) has proposed the mapping of every asset (property) using geographical information system (GIS). Currently, the water board physically visits the properties of the consumers concerned which has become a difficult task owing to the lack of man power.

“The water board records show that there over 9.8 lakh registered consumers but there is no data on the number of illegal water connections and no separate mechanism to track them either,” a senior water board official told TOI. The water board plans to use GIS technology to map each and every asset in under GHMC limits and its peripheral areas.

The information to be collected for this initiative will include a photograph of the property along with details such as the consumer’s name, their consumer account number (CAN), size of water connection and even the consumer’s dues. “Following the completion of asset mapping, there will be no need for physical visits as the information till even the consumer’s door number will be available (to us) with a single click,” explained the water board official.

The water board sees two benefits in this approach. They believe it will help curb illegal water connections which can end up saving around 50 million gallons of water per day that goes unaccounted for and that its new approach will help boost their revenue. “The water aims to complete this initiative in another six months,” the official said.

Kolkata: The firing at Jamia Millia students on Thursday, which coincided with the date of Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination by Nathuram Godse, left a scar on the students in Bengal. They have now vowed to raise the protest pitch against the amended citizenship act as well as those who have become “intolerant towards an alternative narrative”.

“It seems Gandhiji’s killers are still roaming freely. Today’s incident has completed the circle that started in 1948. Nathuram Godse brandished a gun and fired at Mahatma Gandhi and 72 years later, the same scene played out on the Delhi road when a person aimed a gun at students and fired at them. Intolerance towards any alternative narrative has blinded people who now seek an eye for an eye,” said Abhinandan Sinha, a research scholar at the Indian Statistical Institute.

“There is a concerted effort to brand the agitators as anti-nationals and hatred is being spewed against them on social media. The protest at Jamia Millia Islamia was against the way CAA was bulldozed through Parliament. The Supreme Court has started hearing the petition and it shows that the apex court finds merit in the argument of a number of organizations and individuals who have challenged the government’s move,” said Sneha Brishti Nandi, a Bengali literature student at Jadavpur University.

Manjima Dasgupta, a post-graduate student of Bengali literature at Presidency University, felt the person who wielded the gun is a victim of the hate propaganda. “He has anger inside and that is against the unjust system. Unfortunately, he has been brain-washed into finding a common enemy for all his woes. This hate politics in the country has to stop now,” Dasgupta said.

Arkaprabha Mukhopadhyay, a research scholar at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, felt such intolerance is palpable even in Bengal where anti-CAA students are being tagged as ‘azadi gang’ by a section of saffron outfits. “We faced similar hatred when we organized meetings at Kharagpur. Local BJP leaders branded us as azadi gang just because we raised questions,” Sinha said.

Arka Dev Sinha, a first-year student of international relations at Jadavpur University, claimed they were often being targeted as ‘gaddars’. “You will often find them (saffron brigade) saying ‘Desh ki gaddaron ko, goli maro saalon ko (shoot the anti-nationals)’ without even thinking why they are branding someone as anti-national. Just because someone has raised a question against the government cannot turn him into an anti-national. Today, he is just one person and tomorrow there will be five,” he said.

Kolkata: A fire broke out at a four-storey building on Birpara Lane near Paikpara on Thursday afternoon following a blast in the garage , which had been converted into a fireworks warehouse . About 20 fire tenders took nearly two and a half hours to douse the flames. No casualty was reported.

Panic gripped around 24 people living in the building.

While the blast occurred at 1.40pm, all of them vacated their flats and came down to the street in 20 minutes. Swarup Karmakar, one of the residents, found it an uphill task to help his 72-year-old ailing mother-in-law Chandana Barua climb down the stairs. Chinmoy Ghosh, a businessman, who owns a second-floor flat, vacated the flat with his wife and pregnant daughter.

However, neither the fire officials nor the residents had an inkling about the source of the fire. They were all surprised when some fire fighters cut the shutter of the garage and found the fireworks warehouse. After the fire was extinguished, locals gathered at the spot and demanded a strong action against the promoter who had constructed the building and allowed the garage to be turned into a fireworks warehouse.

Bappa Sil, another resident of the building, said, “It is a matter of relief that the explosives have been deactivated.”

Anupam Biswas a marketing manager and a resident demanded a probe into the conversion of a garage space into a fireworks warehouse in a residential area.

An officer of Chitpore PS said they have started a probe and would book the culprit in consultation with the officials of KMC and fire services department.

Hyderabad: Several students from the English and Foreign Languages University ( Eflu ) continued their sitting protest against the administration on Thursday. The students demanded a complete rollback of the recently introduced policies by the executive council.

The Standing Committee of Academic Council (SCAC) had earlier recommended that PhD candidates who clear for the University Grants Commission Junior Research Fellowship (JRF) will be exempted from appearing in the entrance test and directly appear for an interview.

“Marks obtained out of 30 shall be calculated to arrive at the score out of 100, however, no explanation has been given as to how this score out of 30 will be converted into a score out of 100. This will put the non-NET aspirations in a precarious position as they will be expected to score unreasonably high scores in entrance exam. This move will put non-NET PhD candidates at a disadvantage,” said students’union vice-president, Harshal.

As per the new guidelines, only 30 students can enrol for a course and the registration will be on a first-come-first-served basis.

“This means the university will have to employ more faculty in each department as currently, most departments are understaffed,” said another student.

A protest rally was held on Thursday at the NCC Gate of Osmania University (OU) too by the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) student union demanding “an end urban Naxalism”. The ABVP protesters called for the removal of anti-CAA protesters from universities and said there was a need to take stringent measures and organise awareness camps for students in government universities.

Mob anger after the accident on New Bypass Road on Thursday

PATNA: Two vehicles, including a Bihar State Road Transport Corporation (BSRTC) bus, were torched and more than 24 other vehicles damaged by an irate mob after a man was crushed to death by a speeding truck while trying to cross NH-30 near Ramlakhan Path under the Kankarbagh police station area in the city on Thursday.

Traffic movement on the highway remained disrupted for at least three hours due to the protests.

The deceased was identified as Deepak Kumar (22), a daily wager and resident of Sheikhpura village under the Ramkrishna Nagar police station area in the city. The incident occurred when Deepak was on way to a hospital where his mother-in-law was undergoing treatment.

Locals alleged that though the truck involved in the accident was intercepted by them near Mithapur bus stand and handed over to traffic police, the latter set the vehicle free.

Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma, however, said the truck was not set free by traffic police. “The truck fled after the accident. Locals had gone on rampage after accidents on this stretch of national highway earlier as well,” the SSP added. He denied reports that police fired four to five rounds in air to disperse the mob.

Sharma, who reached the spot along with City SP (east) Jitendra Kumar, managed to pacify the mob. “Police are trying to identify the people involved in damaging property. An FIR will be registered at Kankarbagh police station in connection with the incident,” the SSP said.

He said the body of the deceased was sent for autopsy. “The district administration has started the process of providing ex gratia to the victim’s kin,” he added.

HYDERABAD: Members of several student unions gathered at the University of Hyderabad (UoH) administrative block to protest a multitude of issues faced by students. The protesters raised slogans against the recent directive to ban public talks and gatherings with loudspeakers on campus.“Earlier, we had conducted several gatherings and public talks without loudspeakers. For the past four months we have been getting e-mails, circulars and notices from the registrar prohibiting all gatherings...This is an attack on campus democracy and constitutional democratic rights,” said UoH student union president Abhishek Nandan.The students also said that almost 45% students in the varsity are from poor backgrounds and face issues with medical insurance whenever they fall sick as they have to shell out money from their own pockets despite university providing insurance. However, they claim that they are getting little or no help from university in resolving the issues.“The university provided medical insurance but every time a student falls sick they are shifted to corporate hospitals, where the bill comes minimum Rs 30,000. Students have been facing problems claiming their insurance and are shelling out money from their own pockets. The university is now asking us to deal with the insurance company directly. Most students are from economically weak backgrounds, how will they manage that kind of fund?,” Nandan said.The students also raised slogans against the bifurcation of the students’ union fund and demanded the rollback of restrictive clauses of integrated studies which bars students from moving to post-graduation from graduation in case of backlogs.Speaking against the protest UoH Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) president Abhishek Malhotra said the stir was “bogus” and an attempt to create drama.“We all believe in voicing out state and national issues as active students but not at the cost of peace and harmony in the university.“Public talks should be a right for all but who defines the limit because we have seen these organisations forgetting all bounds,” Malhotra said.Nearly 20 policemen were deployed on campus after the students called for the protest.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73802570,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-234055,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/protest-at-uoh-over-admin-apathy-on-med-insurance/articleshow/73780753.cms

Hyderabad: The Telangana high court has issued notices to the state government, revenue secretary, HMDA commissioner, Rangareddy district collector and others asking them to explain the rationale behind allotting five acres of land in Mokilla village in Rangareddy district to film director N Shankar at a nominal cost of Rs 5 lakh per acre when the prevailing price in the area is far higher .

A bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy, while hearing a PIL which challenged this allotment, gave four weeks to the authorities to respond to the contentions in the plea.

Petitioner J Shanker filed the plea contending that the prevailing price in the area was Rs 5 crore per acre and giving it at Rs 5 lakh was irrational. The registration department’s official value in the area itself was Rs 20 lakh per acre and the market value was Rs 5 crore, he said. The state made the allotment by issuing GO Ms No 75 through its municipal administration department on June 21, 2019.

“The state should keep in mind that it is not the owner of the land,” the petitioner said, adding “it is a trustee, a custodian of the public assets. The land belongs to the people of the state and the government of the day must protect the land for the benefit of its people.”

Film director Shankar made a representation to the state seeking allotment of land for setting up a film and TV studio and, based on his plea, the state issued the GO allotting five acres land to him, the petitioner said.

Hyderabad: With numerous startups working in the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) focused areas, the Telangana government is now planning to establish a sanitation hub that will promote and support innovation that will devise solutions on issues related to WASH.

Speaking at the Ink@Wash event, organised by the Administrative Staff College of India, TK Sridevi, commissioner and director of municipal administration, Telangana government said: “We are working on a sanitation fund with urban poverty groups. This fund will attract investments under corporate social responsibilities.”

The managing director of Hyderabad Metro Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) M Dana Kishore admitted that while there are numerous innovations and solutions available to tackle WASH-related issues, there are not enough citizen engagement programmes that are conducted to spread awareness.

“Urban behaviour has not changed as people do not know how to treat waste, recycle it. In Hyderabad alone, almost 38% of water is wasted every day which amounts to 20 million gallons. The reason being a lack of awareness among people on water conservation,” Kishore said while explaining the water board’s new initiative under the water leadership and conservation programme wherein people are being educated about water conservation.

On Friday, municipal administration minister KT Rama Raowill speak on Telangana’s vision for achieveing sustainability development goals.

Visakhapatnam: To facilitate arriving international passengers with e-filling of baggage and currency declarations, Visakhapatnam customs has launched an app called ATITHI.

Passengers travelling to Visakhapatnam airport from an international destination can download the app and declare the currency and belongings they are carrying with approximate value. As soon as they submit their declarations on the app, it would automatically reach the customs officials at the Visakhapatnam airport.

Once passengers reach the Visakhapatnam airport they need not undergo any checking procedures. Customs officials will match the contents of the baggage in the x-ray conveyor with the declaration filed by the passengers. If they are convinced that declaration matches the contents, concerned passengers will be allowed to leave.

“It has been observed that on long haul flights, passengers become extremely tired once they the destination. The customs check is the last check at the destination. So the app will give them some respite,” DK Srinivas, principal customs commissioner, Visakhapatnam, told TOI.

At present, there are three international flights from the city – an Air Asia flight to Malaysia, a Scoot Air flight to Singapore, and an Air India flight to Dubai via Hyderabad.

The roof of a school in Togarsi, Shivamogga, had collapsed during last year’s rain

BENGALURU: Nearly 3,400 schools that sustained severe damage during heavy rain and subsequent floods in 15 educational districts and needed to be rebuilt are yet to witness any kind of renovation six months later. Of the 6,000 schools which required partial repair, only around 1,000 are ready, while work is under way in over 4,500.

The flood-affected schools were divided into two categories — those which had to be demolished and built from scratch and others which needed repair. The government released Rs 199 crore for repair through the districts’ deputy commissioners, but no allocation was made for institutions where where classrooms were completely damaged and had to be rebuilt.

According to the January 28 data available with the planning section of department of public instruction (DPI), repair work in 1,034 schools has been completed and has been initiated in another 4,513. It is yet to begin in 525 schools, of which the highest number is in Shivamogga district.

The government has approached National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development Fund (NABARD) for funds to rebuild classrooms. “We’ve been informed that Rs 600 crore will be granted from rural development funds for school reconstruction. However, we are yet to get written approval,” said KG Jagadeesha, commissioner for public instruction.

The cost of reconstruction ranges from Rs 11.5 lakh to Rs 17.2 lakh per school. Around 6,500 classrooms in 3,227 primary schools and 159 high schools have to be rebuilt.

No damaged school is completely ready in Gadag, Uttara Kannada, Chikkamagaluru and Dakshina Kannada districts. In Udupi, where 135 schools were affected, work has been completed in only five. Belagavi has the highest number of schools which have been renovated (232), followed by Shivamogga (149), Hassan (135) and Dharwad (133).

The state has a dozen onshore and six offshore casinos

PANAJI: From February 1, 2020, Goans will be completely banned from gambling in casinos, except those working on them. Currently, a dozen onshore and six offshore casinos are operating in the state.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Thursday that a gaming commissioner will be appointed soon, and he will be vested with powers to check the identity of the visitors to casinos. A notification will be issued in this regard on Friday.

“We are appointing the commissioner of commercial tax department as the gaming commissioner. From February 1, he will stop entry of Goans into casinos. However, those working on casinos will be out of its purview,” he said.

The chief minister said the government will also come up with rules and regulations under the Goa Public Gambling Act 1976. “Gaming commission will draft the rules and regulations,” he said.

It was a long-pending demand of the people, with the legislators echoing their concerns in the House, as many families had turned bankrupt.

In June 2015, the home department had first drafted the rules in which there was a provision to arrest any person under 21 years of age and any Goan, irrespective of age, found gambling in a casino in the state. But the file could not cross the bureaucratic hurdles.

Under the draft rules, the home department had given powers to the state government to appoint a gaming commissioner, who could be a private person or a government officer.

The department said that if a private person is appointed then s/he should be provided logistic support including staff. The draft rules also said that the collector, excise commissioner or commercial tax commissioner could be appointed as the gaming commissioner.

It was in June 2012 that the state government passed the amendment to the Goa Public Gaming Act, 1976 by introducing the Goa Public Gaming (Amendment) Bill, 2012.

However, the indirect election for other posts had to be called off as the mandatory minimum requirement of 50% of the directly elected ward members (10 out of 19) did not take part and boycotted to show their protest to the election officials, accusing them of misusing power and colluding with the ruling party to declare Kasthuri as chairperson.

Of the 19 wards in Kovilpatti union where direct election was held on December 30, 2019, DMK won eight seats, followed by AIADMK (5), independents (4) and the CPI and DMDK one each. Indirect election for the post of chairman and vice-chairman could not be conducted on January 11 as returning officer S Jayaseelan was hospitalised due to cardiac arrest.

On Thursday, DMK’s member from ward 9 M Poomari and AIADMK’s Kasthuri were in the fray. The poll began around 10.30am and by 11.15am Umashankar declared Kasthuri as winner 10 votes against the nine got by DMK.

Agitated by this, the DMK ward members staged a protest there and were forcibly removed from the meeting hall by the police. Led by MP Kanimozhi, the 10 DMK supporting ward members staged a blockade on the Pasuvanthanai Road. They refused to take part in the indirect poll for the vice-chairperson’s post in the afternoon.

Around 4pm Kasthuri assumed office as union chairman in the presence of information and publicity minister Kadambur C Raju. Heavy police deployment was made to avert law and order issues. Riot control vehicle was also brought to the spot and barricades were put up to keep the situation under check.

DMK cadre Saravanan and his mother Lakshmi doused themselves with fuel to attempt self-immolation over the turn of events and were stopped by the police.

PUNE: The Warje police have booked three men on the charges of cheating a 21-year-old engineer from Karvenagar to the tune of Rs 1.18 lakh by promising him to sell a second-hand motorcycle in May 2019.

The engineer, who works with a private company in Kothrud , lodged a complaint with the Warje police on Wednesday.

Police said the victim ran a search on an e-commerce website for a second-hand motorcycle and came across an advertisement which said that a man from Gujarat wanted to sell his motorcycle.

The victim called up the phone number mentioned in the advertisement.

According to the first information report, a man who answered the phone informed him that he was in the Army and posted in Gujarat. He said he wanted to sell his motorcycle as he had been transferred to a far-off location.

The suspect then shared the photographs of the motorcycle with the engineer.

The police said the victim liked the motorcycle and decided to go ahead with the deal. The suspect asked him to transfer Rs 10,000 on his Unified Payment Interface (UPI) as an initial payment. The victim immediately transferred the money from his UPI app.

In the next two days, the suspect kept on demanding money from him under various pretexts such as insurance, courier insurance, courier and other fees. In just two days, the victim transferred a collective sum of Rs 1.18 lakh.

The suspects promised to send the motorcycle to him and then stopped answering his call altogether. After waiting for a couple of months, the victim realised that he had been duped. He approached the Warje police and lodged a complaint.

In December last year, a Nashik resident was arrested by the city police for duping several people on the pretext of selling his scooter and then stealing the vehicle from buyers using a duplicate key after receiving money from them.

The man would post advertisements on an e-commerce website to sell his scooter.

KOLKATA: Protesters at various sit-ins have expressed their concern over the firing at Jamia Millia students by a gunman on Thursday and expressed anxiety on the safety of the demonstrators in Kolkata. Many of them went into a hurdle soon after the news to review security at the sit-in spots.

There are at least five sit-in spots in Kolkata and Howrah — including the ones at Park Circus, Ekbalpore, Zakaria Street, Hogg Street and Pilkhana — where thousands have been sitting on round-the-clock vigil, demanding a complete repeal of the amended citizenship law.

“We condemn the cowardly act of firing on the students of Jamia Milia. Several attempts are being made to derail the entire movement that has so far been peaceful,” said a core member of the organizing team at Park Circus Maidan. “The incident has also forced us to rethink the security at Park Circus. Anybody who identifies with the cause is welcome, so it is difficult to scan every entrant,” he added.

Currently, there are 200 volunteers who taking care of different aspects, including security, cleaning, distributing food and chalking out the schedule. Several cops are posted inside and outside the park through the day. “We will be more vigilant and increase the number of volunteers,” an organizer said.

The attack in Delhi was the talking point among the participants at almost all the sit-ins across the city. “It is an attempt to instigate the students at Jamia Milia and JNU and those protesting peacefully at Shaheen Bagh. In the last few days, a section of politicians have made several unpleasant remarks and even issued threats,” said Ijaz Wadud, a businessman in central Kolkata.

At Nawab Ali Park in Ekbalpore, too, the organizers have decided to review the security at the sit-in spot. They have also cautioned the protesters not to get provoked by anybody. “Hundreds of women and children come here everyday. We cannot compromise with their safety,” said Arshad Parvez Khan , one of the organizers.

At Hogg Street, the sit-in spot is cordoned off with guard rails and several cops have been deployed since it is in the midst of a very busy pocket. In Zakaria Street, too, cops are posted round the clock.

The season this year has been recording high night temperatures which have mostly been around 15°C or more.Day temperatures have also plunged 1 to 2 degrees below the normal in the state, and lower than 30°C in many parts.The lowest minimum temperature on Thursday in Maharashtra was recorded in Nashik at 7.9°C, followed by Jalgaon and Ahmednagar at 8.5°C and 9.7°C, respectively.The spell may be short-lived.

The minimum temperature in Pune is unlikely to go below 10°C on Friday.“Cold northerly winds began to penetrate partially uninterrupted in the state on Thursday, especially over north Maharashtra, which is why Jalgaon and Nashik recorded single digit night temperatures.

VISAKHAPATNAM: Be careful of the friends you make on social networking sites and believing the promises they make, for on the other side might be a Nigerian fraudster looking to dupe you of your hard-earned savings. Following the arrest of four Nigerians from New Delhi by the cybercrime department of Visakhapatnam city police, the police is looking to spread this message to port city residents.“Opening fake accounts on social networking sites, befriending someone, gaining their trust over the years and then duping the person is nothing new for these Nigerians fraudsters. They follow a typical modus operandi,” a police official said.The modus operandi of these fraudsters is simple. The fraudsters become friends with a person and stay in touch with them online for a few months. Once they earn the person’s confidence and trust, the fraudsters make the victims a lucrative offer and once the latter is is ready to accept the offer, the fraudsters ask the victims for money to ‘convince’ them that the victim is serious. Once the fraudsters get the money, they just disappear.“The offer varies from person to person, depending on what can actually convince the victim. The fraudster sometimes tells the victim they will transfer money as gift. Or, they might tell the victim that they want to strike a lucrative business deal,” the police official added.Once the victim is convinced, the fraudsters ask them for money on a different pretext. “They might call pretending to be a customs or RBI official and ask for money as ‘tax’ to clear their gifts. The victim falls for it as they have decided to transfer the money as an investment before receiving as huge sum of money as promised by the fraudsters,” the official added.Police said that such crimes can only be stopped if there is awareness among users of social networking sites, because once the crime is committed it becomes difficult to zero in on the culprits. This is because the fraudsters normally don’t target people from the city they are operating from.Even if the police makes an arrest, it becomes difficult to recover the stolen amount. By the time the arrests are made, the fraudsters send the money to their relatives in Nigeria through a hawala racket.A senior official explained that there are a few wholesalers in south India who export commodities to Nigeria, which the fraudsters use to transport the money. When importers in Nigeria needs to pay money to wholesalers in India, they pay the money to the fraudsters’ relatives in Nigeria. The fraudsters in India then pay the duped amount to the Indian wholesaler.“Earlier investigations revealed that a lot such transactions take place through accounts opened in nationalised banks branches in Kerala. But it is really impossible to recover those amounts,” an official said.",visakhapatnam,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73792511,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-395584,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/beware-of-being-duped-by-nigerian-fraudsters-cops/articleshow/73780293.cms

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India (ECI) has issued a notice to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for making a promise at the Tis Hazari court complex on January 13 to open a mohalla clinic there if land is provided. The remarks, made after the model code of conduct came into force on January 6, have been verified by the chief electoral officer (CEO) of Delhi.The Election Commission has found Kejriwal in violation of a provision that prohibits ministers and other authorities from making any promise of construction of roads, provision of drinking water facilities etc. Part VII of the code says the party in power, whether at the Centre or the state concerned, should ensure that no cause is given for any complaint that it has used its official position for the election campaign.In a complaint to the commission, BJP member Neeraj alleged that Kejriwal, as the chief minister, had announced at a gathering of advocates organised by Delhi Bar Association for Makar Sankranti and Lohri celebrations. “If land could be provided on the premises (of the complex), a mohalla clinic will be set up,” Neeraj quoted the chief minister as saying.Kejriwal has been asked to explain his position before 5pm on Friday. If no explanation is submitted by then, the poll panel will take a decision without any further information to the AAP convener. An AAP functionary said the party had received the notice and would send a reply within the deadline.The chief minister had reportedly said the AAP government was ready to set up mohalla clinics in all courts if space was available and also promised gyms. “I hope that this time I will get the positive support from you,” he had been quoted as saying in the Delhi CEO’s report submitted to ECI.On January 6, the dates for the Delhi assembly elections were announced, immediately bringing into effect the model code of conduct across the city.",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73792923,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-840587,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi/ec-asks-kejriwal-to-explain-mohalla-pitch/articleshow/73781883.cms

NEW DELHI: On the morning of January 30, the youth who opened fire around 1.30 pm at students gathered for a march in Jamia Millia Islamia wrote on Facebook : “I’m about to bring them azaadi”. And “You may have heard of tandav, now you will see…”.Not just that, he livestreamed a video of himself walking around the Jamia neighbourhood before he took aim. The video had 16,000 views. A Facebook friend posted: “You are on the news and I recognised you. Serve them azaadi in a fitting manner.” Comments included several congratulatory messages.The display photo on one of his Facebook profiles, in which the joining date is July 2018, shows him kissing a sword, the hilt wrapped in a red cloth with gold trims, with a saffron cloth around his neck. His posts are interspersed liberally with emojis of triangular red flags and flexed biceps.The youth’s posts read as if he was on a suicide mission: “On my last journey (antim yatra), wrap me in saffron and let there be calls of Jai Shri Ram.” Another post at the same time read “Game over, Shaheen Bagh”. Another says, “Chandan bhai, this revenge is for you.” The reference seems to be to Chandan Gupta, a 22-year-old killed in a Tiranga Yatra in Kasganj, UP, in 2018.His posts of the day earlier also reflect his thinking. “Some people say preaching Hindutva Hindutva will not feed, so listen you xxxx, if you are alive to earn bread alone there is no difference between you and a dog,” wrote the shooter, who TOI is not naming since he is a minor going by his Class X marksheet.On January 28, when a gunman was overpowered at Shaheen Bagh, this young man posted at 3.20pm: “Dhandabagh, tera baap aaya.” Earlier that day, at 1.36pm, he had reacted to a post by an Updesh Rana, who runs a private Facebook page called Youth Brigade, which has over 1.25 lakh followers. The rules for members state they should only talk about “Hindu Samaj and nationalism.” The January 27, 10.50pm, post by Rana was: “In a week, Shaheen Bagh should fold up, or else one lakh people will squat on dharna at the very place to evict you. What we say, we have done so far (sic).”The gunman disagreed: “By then administration itself would have evicted them, EC will evict them, what’s the point of going there later? Why no action so far????? If I had half your followers I would have made Shaheen Bagh Jallianwalah Bagh by now (sic).”He seems to have made up his mind by the evening. On January 28 at 9pm, he announced: “Attention!

He posted pictures of him in Dal meetings with friends, as a teenager with a rifle and on March 30, 2018, of a Bajrang Dal rally in Jewar, his hometown, in which he participated.

Representative image

PUNE: A 54-year-old retired Army subedar, who was on the run after being booked nine months ago in a Rs19 lakh cheating case , was arrested by a city police team from a wedding ceremony venue in New Delhi on Wednesday.

Police said Shailendra Mahirprasad Gupta, a resident of NIBM Road in Kondhwa , was facing charges of duping a wholesale pharmacy shopowner in Sadsahiv Peth by representing himself as an Army officer and offering help to the latter for securing a medicine supply order from the Delhi Cantonment and the Directorate General of Army Course.

The Vishrambaug police were searching for Gupta after the shopowner, Mahendra Pannalal Pitaliya (50) of Bibvewadi-Kondhwa road, lodged an FIR against him in March last year. Acting on a tip-off, senior inspector Dadasaheb Chudappa, sub-inspector A I Pathan and other team members flew to Delhi and arrested Gupta from the wedding venue. He was brought to Pune on Thursday and produced before a court that ordered his remand in police custody till February 3.

Pathan told TOI, “We had visited Gupta’s house many times in the past. But he was not in the city. We received a tip-off four days ago that he was supposed to attend a ‘Haldi’ ceremony in Faridabad. But he did not attend this ceremony. We came to know later that he was to attend the wedding ceremony of a close relative in Delhi.”

The policemen went to Delhi and prepared themselves to attend the wedding ceremony. “We wanted to show that we were not policemen. If we would have gone there in uniform, Gupta might have been alerted. The policemen dressed up nattily for the wedding function and reached the venue. We found Gupta there and nabbed him,” Pathan said.

According to the FIR filed in March last year, Gupta told Pitaliya that he had “good contacts” in the Delhi Cantonment and the Directorate General Army Course, New Delhi. He told the shopowner that the two establishments needed 30 bottles of a costly medicine. Gupta told Pitaliya that he could help him with the registration formalities.

KOLKATA: Passengers passing through Sealdah station can now enjoy affordable meals at a swanky 1,911 square feet two-storey joint run by a major food chain of the city under the aegis of Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC). The unique food court was inaugurated on Thursday in the presence of senior IRCTC and Eastern Railway (ER) officials.

“It was a challenge for us. The space in the south section of the station was encroached by some illegal occupants. We had never expected that it would turn out so good in the end. Pre-fabricated structures were used to construct the two-storey building. The company that finally agreed to build this food court also took up the challenge and decided to create something unique. Passengers can enjoy all kinds of vegetarian meals and snacks there,” said Debasish Chandra, group general manager (east), IRCTC. The food court came up after the railway authorities realised the demands of nearly two million passengers using Sealdah station daily. Most of them are suburban passengers who may stop for a quick bite while long-distance passengers can stay longer for a meal before starting their journey. Passengers of the trains like the Darjeeling Mail and Padatik Express , which don’t have on-board catering facilities, also needed a proper place to pick up dinner. A major concern was pricing and the vendor was convinced to keep rates down.

“As this is a unique venture, the company doesn’t want to look only at profits. They have offered food at ‘factory prices’. There are also some interesting offers for packaged items sold on the ground floor. We have ensured safety and hygiene. The first floor is for diners. The food is not cooked at the station to prevent fires, rather it’s brought there by the vendor from its kitchens elsewhere. Only heating is allowed. Quality of food will also be checked routinely,” said another IRCTC official.

308,['31/01/2020'],Protesters take to poetry to link the country by one common thread,"This story is from January 31, 2020

When power leads man toward arrogance, poetry reminds him of his limitations. When power narrows the area of man’s concern, poetry reminds him of the richness and diversity of existence.

— John F Kennedy

People protesting against the amended citizenship law in the city are using poetry to show their resilience and express their resistance and defiance. People carrying posters having couplets written on them in Bengali, English, Hindis and Urdu has become a common sight at the numerous protest sites in the city and beyond. Even social media is flushed with small yet catchy poems and couplets.

Students reciting poetry and others joining in can be heard at any of the several processions that have been organised to protest against the CAA and the NRC. While many recite iconic lines like ‘Lazim hai hum bhi dekhenge’, others have coined their own couplets, poems or shayaris to express the situation and show their defiance. Many are also using poetry to inspire others to join the movement.

“Such oppression has a strong cultural reaction. At times of such unrest and unease in the country, poetry does make us calm and make people realise the injustice being meted out to them. This is a phenomenon that has been around for several centuries. Several slogans or political poetry strive to rhyme and are used as metaphors to be used as a medium for voicing protests,” said Barnali Mukherjee, who teaches English literature in a city college.

Businessman Asif Iqbal has written a Bengali song titled ‘Amar Bangla’ that talks about the diversity and inclusiveness that exists in Bengal — ‘Sara prithvi ghure dekhlam amar bangla kothao pai ni, Oei mishit kothao paini, oei hanshi kothao payi nei’ (I travelled the entire world but did not find any other place like Bengal, Neither did I find the sweetness nor that smile). “The prevailing political situation inspired me to write the song. People of Bengal have decide to resist fascism,” said Iqbal.

Soon after protests against CAA broke out in December last year, comedian Varun Grover had released a poem ‘Kaagaz Nahi Dikhayenge’ (we won’t show the papers). The Bengali version of the poem was recited by several Bengali actors and other artistes, which vent viral on social media.

Many students have been spending couplets to portray the situation in the country. They either write them on colourful posters or use them to raise slogans. Inspiration is also being drawn from the popular culture so that it resonates with the youth. “We are using the power of social media to reach out to more and more people with our message. When the message is articulated through poetry, it has good traction,” said Ujjal Ghosh, a student of Jadavpur University.

Rose prices are likely to soar before February 14

PUNE: The extended rainy season last year, coupled with high humidity and fungal diseases, has resulted in 30%-40% drop in cut roses production this year. The drop may also be witnessed during the Valentine’s Day period and thereafter, rose growers stressed.

Vinay Shinde, who owns a floriculture farm in Talegaon, said that the dip in production of cut roses has been to the tune of 30%-40% from June last year up till now due to severe rains in 2019. “There may also be some shortage of roses in the domestic market around February 10-12 not only due to a fall in production, but also early harvests due to a warm winter. This may cause an increase in rose prices around V-Day,” he said.

Further, first advance estimates of 2019-20 from the state horticulture department have revealed that cut rose production is likely to fall to 12,000 metric tonne in this crop year from 37,000 metric tonne in 2018-19. However, officials also said that the latest estimates are yet to include production data from some districts in the state.

Praveen Sharma, president of the Indian Society of Floriculture Professionals, Talegaon Dabhade, told TOI that in 2019, Maharashtra farmers experienced excessive rainy days as compared to 2018, with approximately 15% fall in sunny days. “The sunshine and temperature play a crucial role in flower production. There is an overall drop in cut roses production this year by 10%-15%. Also, due to a warmer January, some farmers have received early flush by a week. Usually, V-Day production begins from January 25 till February 12. Due to warmer days, the production has arrived from January 20 in some cases,” said Sharma.

Avinash Jadhav, a rose exporter based in Pune, said that in general, there has been a 30%-40% drop in qualitative production of cut roses despite being grown in greenhouses. This may affect supplies during V-Day. “The rough winds and heavy rains affected qualitative production of roses even in greenhouses,” he said.

Jaysingh Hulawale, a rose grower in Maval region said there has been a 25% drop in production as compared to last year. “In some cases, harvests have also happened early due to warmer temperatures this winter,” he said.

There is a contest between the DMK and the AIADMK for the Sivaganga district panchayat. It is a 16-member district panchayat council in which the DMK and the AIADMK has eight seats each. On Thursday only the DMK members turned up for elections leading to the postponement of the election.

Similarly, indirect elections to the posts of chairman and vice-chairman of the Thirupuvanam panchayat union was postponed by Sivaganga district collector J Jayakanthan citing law and order issues, as some of the elected councillors had sought police protection fearing threats to their lives. In the Narikudi panchayat union, clashes erupted between the parties where Panchavarnam contested on behalf of the AIADMK and Kaleeswari the DMK.

The activist with her Nari Samata Manch team (above) and with friends Sadhana Dadhich and Suniti SR, two years... Read More

PUNE: Vidya Bal ’s crusade for women's rights and against oppressive practices began when she was around 40 years old. It continued for four decades, and almost till her last breath.

The veteran social activist and feminist writer, who turned 84 on January 12, passed away at a private nursing home in Pune on Thursday. Faced with several health issues, she took comfort in palliative care. She is survived by a daughter and two sons.

Scores of activists were at Vaikunth crematorium for the last rites. Deputy chairperson of the legislative council Neelam Gorhe was present. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar sent condolence messages.

This year, Vidyatai had pledged to fight for euthanasia, the practice of intentionally ending life to relieve the pain and suffering, her close friends and associates said.

As the writer of several books and the editor of a well-read magazine, Bal raised many issues concerning women. Through PILs that ranged from the demand for good toilets for women in every ward or a law that allowed entry to all in all religious places, her positive spirit guided her, her close friends said.

Forty years ago, Bal came across the deaths of two women due to domestic violence. She formed Nari Samata Manch to address the problems of middle-class housewives whose issues never came out in the open.

“Vidyatai’s courage and hope to bring about a change prompted us to start the endeavour in unchartered waters,’’ her friend Sadhana Dadhich, who now heads the forum, said. “Tai (as she was fondly called) worked right through, till she was well. She never believed in hierarchy,” she added.

Preeti Karmarkar, who has worked with the manch for 20 years, said she was a stalwart and unique in addressing several women’s issues. Her editorial pieces in her magazine, Miloon Saryajani, which she founded in 1989, reflected social milieu. Her writings in Stree, another magazine, in 1964 and her short stint at the Pune division of Akashwani in the late 1950s led her to take up several issues, Karmarkar said.

She added to her work with each passing year, social activist Asim Sarode who has been associated with her for over three decades, said.

“She was not afraid to face challenges. Her discussions on euthanasia made death less intimidating,’’ Sarode said.

Her journalistic pieces on the problems and issues women faced, especially in the rural areas, were powerful, yet sensitive, another friend Suniti SR said. “Along with Medha Patkar , Tai addressed various issues as part of Narmada Bachao Andolan,” she added.

In her work for gender equality, Bal set up a centre for men’s issues called Speak Out and a marriage bureau Saath Saath where men and women could have open discussions to find out their compatibility.

Activist Kiran Moghe said Vidyatai’s passing away was a personal loss. “All women activists sought her guidance and her campaign for equal rights for both men and women will never be forgotten,”she added.

Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti president Avinash Patil said she has left behind a void. “She was a feminist with a practical approach and united all of us to work with her for women’s empowerment,” he added.

PANAJI: Following the Supreme Court order on Thursday allowing mining companies in the state to export the iron ore extracted before March 15, 2018, chief minister Pramod Sawant said that mining activities can start within eight days.Stating that this is the first time a judgment has come in favour of mining in Goa, Sawant said, “I welcome the Supreme Court order on behalf of Goa.”The chief minister said that now mining companies should re-employ retrenched workers and pay full wages to those whose salaries were slashed due to mining closure.Mining activities can start within eight days as the companies already have buyers for the ore, the chief minister told reporters.He said that this order allows the mining companies to export iron ore stocked at plots and mining jetties till June 1, 2020. “As per state government records, over nine million tonnes of iron ore is lying at jetties and plots,” Sawant said.Sources said that iron ore of grade 48 to 54 is lying inside mining leases. Most of the ore would be exported to China. Since there is no extraction of ore, only truck, barge and machinery owners would benefit, they said.He said that the government will not get any direct revenue as the mining companies have already paid royalty, but it is important for the state to start mining activities. “Small amount of revenue would be generated in the form of transport permits and others,” the CM said.“After mining companies complete all formalities they will be allowed to handle the ore. In the interest of the people, the state government will cooperate with the mining companies,” Sawant said. He also said that the mining companies will get the entire mining season to export the ore.Chief minister said that there is a good international market for iron ore and there is a scope for export of iron ore. “Most of the mining companies will export the ore and it will help accelerate the economy,” he said.Sawant said that they were hoping for positive judgments in other mining-related cases too.Mining in Goa came to a halt in March 2018 after the Supreme Court quashed the second renewal of 88 mining leases.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73788389,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-343846,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mining-cos-can-start-work-in-8-days-says-cm/articleshow/73781890.cms

Representative image

PUNE: A case of theft was registered against two dog breeders for allegedly stealing a Lhasa Apso from a farmhouse at Nimbalkarwadi in Katraj. The offence was registered at the Bharati Vidyapeeth police station on Wednesday.

The Lhasa Apso breed of dogs is considered to be among the most expensive. The stolen dog was said to be worth Rs2.80 lakh.

The trainer of the dog, Sachin Maduraj Anthony (36), has lodged an FIR with the Bharati Vidyapeeth police. According to the complaint, the theft happened on Tuesday between 4.30pm and 7.30pm.

Anthony told TOI that he had kept the Lhasa Apso along with 15 other dogs of different breeds at the farmhouse at Nimbalkarwadi in Katraj. “I also have a kennel there,” he stated.

The complainant said that on Tuesday a lady living near the farmhouse told him that two men sneaked into the farmhouse and fled with the Lhasa Apso. “The lady knew their names. She was also aware that the duo were dog breeders since they had come to Nimbalkarwadi with a dog cage a few months ago,” Anthony said.

The dog trainer searched for the Lhasa Apso at different spots on Wednesday and later in the night lodged an FIR with the Bharati Vidyapeeth police station. “The dog was 2.4 years old and was of golden colour,” Anthony said.

About a fortnight ago, the Lhasa Apso had won a prize in the dog show organized in the city. “I am worried about the health of the dog,” Anthony said.

Sub-inspector Mahendra Patil said that the police are yet to make any arrests in the case. “We are investigating the case from all angles,” he said.

Roorkee: A small-scale factory of quilt and mattress manufacturing in a village near Roorkee was gutted after a massive fire broke out on Thursday evening. According to the police, the fire was caused due to electric short-circuit.

The incident took place in Padli Gujjar village. Two fire tenders were deployed to the spot and it took them more than two hours to douse the flames.

At the time of the incident, five workers were asleep inside the factory, but there were no reports of human loss or injuries. The exact loss incurred is yet to be calculated, but it is being assumed that the goods destroyed were worth Rs 15 lakh.

“Since huge combustible materials like cloths, cotton, etc., were in the factory, the fire rapidly caught spread inside the building,” said Rajesh Sah, in-charge of Gangnahar police station.

Meanwhile, a dejected owner, Abid Ali, said, “I don’t know the exact loss I incurred in this fire, but my factory has now been reduced to ashes.”

318,['31/01/2020'],Rathod pitches for Tipeshwar tiger reserve; proposal ready,"This story is from January 31, 2020

Nagpur: With notifying Tipeshwar wildlife sanctuary as a tiger reserve being one of the priorities of forest minister Sanjay Rathod, a proposal has been readied by extending adjoining forest area of the sanctuary.

Tipeshwar, 180km from Nagpur in Pandharkawda tehsil of Yavatmal district, is currently 149sqkm. Sources said an additional 40sqkm adjoining reserve forest area with no villages will be added, making it 189sqkm. There is already existing tiger population in the forest area proposed to be extended. There are 10-12 tigers in the sanctuary.

The proposal has been forwarded to APCCF (wildlife) HS Hooda’s office at Nagpur. Hooda did not respond to TOI’s calls.

NTCA guidelines say that to maintain viable populations of tigers and life support ecological systems in natural wilderness areas, a minimum inviolate space of 800-1,000 sqkm should be maintained as inviolate area to support a viable population in tiger landscapes, based on tiger life history parameters, territory sizes and population viability analysis.

Citing this norm, state’s wildlife wing is reluctant to declare Tipeshwar a tiger reserve, despite a demand for the last five years from wildlife buffs, conservationists, and, more importantly, politicians.

The first proposal was pushed in 2014-15 by notifying same area as reserve. In 2016, to make the tiger reserve viable, then field director of Pench MS Reddy mooted a proposal by combining Painganga sanctuary (425sqkm) and Tipeshwar (149sqkm), making it 574sqkm. This is the third proposal, which has added adjoining forests.

“Tiger reserve issue had come up in review meeting with forest minister after he assumed charge. Though officials explained Tipeshwar was too small to be declared a reserve, the minister asked to extend the sanctuary and wanted it done to benefit locals through Dr Shyamaprasasd Mukherjee Jan Van scheme, and boost tourism,” said sources close to the minister.

Earlier, ex-minister Sudhir Mungantiwar and local MLAs too favoured notifying Tipeshwar as a reserve. “While declaring any area a reserve, political will is necessary. When there is so much political support, why not declare it a tiger reserve? It will help enrich corridors to Kawal tiger reserve in Telangana and Painganga,” said Ramzan Virani, honorary wildlife warden.

“Tomorrow, it is possible the same forest area, which is to be added to the sanctuary, may get encroached upon or is diverted for some other purposes. Hence, we need to act positively,” Virani added.

Virani said the dispersal of male cub T1-C1 in June 2019 also underlines the importance of the sanctuary, and need for protecting its corridors and strengthening areas between Tipeshwar and Painganga. Earlier too, at least 3-4 tigers from the sanctuary dispersed to Telangana and Painganga.

A section of wildlife officials fear that the restrictions will be resented by people if the sanctuary is notified as a reserve. “Once declared a reserve, we will also have to create buffer zones as per NTCA guidelines,” they said.

They added the area is already being protected due to which tiger numbers have gone up. Declaring all tiger bearing areas as reserves doesn’t augur well, they said.

IMP BOX

1) Sanctuary Vs Tiger Reserve

* All rights of people in a national park/reserve must be settled, while in a sanctuary certain rights can be allowed

* Livestock grazing is prohibited in reserve but it can be allowed in a regulated manner in sanctuaries

* A sanctuary can up be upgraded to a reserve but a national park cannot be downgraded to a sanctuary

2) Present position: There are 6 tiger reserves in state — Tadoba-Andhari, Melghat, Bor, Pench, Sahyadri and Navegaon-Nagzira

3) Why Tiger Reserve?

Tiger is a top predator which is at the apex of the food chain and keeps the population of wild ungulates in check, thereby maintaining the balance between prey herbivores and the vegetation upon which they feed

4) Tipeshwar: It was declared a sanctuary in 1997. Spread in Kelapur and Ghatanji tehsils, it has support of forest minister Sanjay Rathod, BJP leaders Sudhir Mungantiwar, ex-MLA Raju Todsam, ex-MP Hansraj Ahir & Cong’s Vijay Darda

Madurai: Amid reports that the school education department has directed government and aided schools to hold special classes for class VIII students, in view of the upcoming board exams, Madurai district chief educational officer(CEO), R Swaminathan, cleared the air and said that that no such directions were given to schools.

Speaking to TOI, Swaminathan said that though the students need to be adequately prepared to face the exams, such classes would only result in increasing mental stress for students. “We have not asked for any special classes to be conducted nor has any circular been issued to us directing the same. Already normal classes are held for 7-8 hours in schools and an extra hour will lead to unnecessary pressure for students,” he said. Government school teachers welcomed the announcement saying that special classes would be a burden for the students. “Mandatory special class beyond school hours would be tough on the Class VIII students because of their young age. It won’t add to their productivity,” said the principal of a government middle school.

Many teachers said that they face many challenges while training Class VIII students for the board exams. The most prominent among their concerns is that students, who are used to writing exams term-wise as per the Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation, now have to study the whole year’s portions. “Students will find it difficult. To be honest, some of the students had even thrown away their first term books after their first term exams as the announcement about the board exams only came later,” said a teacher.

CPM leaders and others, who were spared detention, managed to reach Rajghat and formed a human chain

NEW DELHI: A call to form human chains across the city to protest against Citizenship Amendment Act , National Register for Citizens and National Population Register on Thursday was disrupted as police detained most people in the gathering. Barring 15 people, the others were taken away by police. According to police , 300 people were detained.

Members of Left parties were spared detention and CPM leaders Prakash Karat, Brinda Karat and Sitaram Yechury, women’s rights activist Kavita Krishnan and others managed to reach Rajghat and form a human chain. They sang the national anthem at 5.17pm, the time when Mahatma Gandhi was shot dead in 1948.

Seema, a resident of Turkman Gate, said, “Jab jab sarkar darti hai, police ko aage karti hai (Whenever the government is scared, it puts police in front). We know we are not supposed to raise slogans, that is why we are standing here peacefully. In a democracy, it is our right to protest.”

Karat said, “We are here to remember Mahatma Gandhi, who was the symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity. This is the double standard of Amit Shah’s home ministry. On one hand, you are not filing an FIR against politicians indulging in hate speeches, while on the other you are not letting us even form a human chain.”

Around 2.8km from Rajghat, former JNU professor Kamal Mitra Chenoy and Delhi University teachers were detained at Delhi Gate. “They are taking us away without giving us a reason,” Chenoy told TOI, while being taken to a nearby police station.

About half an hour later, political activist Yogendra Yadav and senior lawyer Prashant Bhushan came with others holding the national flag. Sporting badges with “Hey Ram” written on them and holding the Constitution, they marched to Delhi Gate metro station, from where they were detained. However, at 5.17pm, despite being detained, they sang the national anthem. They were subsequently taken to a stadium in Hari Nagar.

“People with pistols are walking around freely, but those who hold the Constitution are being detained. This is the governance of the country. Ultimately, Godse will lose and Gandhi will win,” Yadav said.

However, people managed to form a small human chain at Jama Masjid and near Lal Qila.

Delhi Police said no permission was granted for forming a human chain. DCP (Central) MS Randhawa tweeted, “Some organisations applied for permission to form human chain in and around Rajghat. Their permissions have been denied as it is not a traditional route and the organisers have been informed. Organisers have been requested to apply for designated places like Jantar Mantar, Ramlila Maidan, etc.”

Dehradun: A major discontent is brewing in the state Congress as seven out of its 11 MLAs plan to meet Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in the first week of February. The MLAs have blown the bugle against Indira Hridayesh and sought her removal from the post of leader of Opposition in the state assembly. On the other side, Congress state chief Pritam Singh, too, has sought time from Gandhi.

Though the senior members are reluctant to comment on the issue, insiders termed the ongoing tussle within the party as the outcome of the differences between former CM Harish Rawat and leader of Opposition Indira Hridayesh. In the last assembly session in December 2019, Congress MLAs Harish Dhami and Karan Mahra had accused the state leadership of ignoring Rawat in party events. However, the Rawat camp blew the bugle against Hridayesh, when Dhami’s name featured on the last slot in the 98-member list of state secretaries, which was announced recently. While other MLAs were included in the special invitee list of Congress committee, only Dhami featured in the list of secretaries.

“We are seven of us and are going to meet the party’s national leadership so that the facts and developments, which are going around in Uttarakhand come to their knowledge,” Dhami said, adding that the MLAs intend to meet the party chief in the first week of February. He claimed that a section of the party was being ignored for a long period, “but knows we will not tolerate it any longer”.

Ranikhet MLA Karan Mahra too has been vocal in extending solidarity with Rawat. “He is a former MP, ex-CM and presently AICC general secretary and party in-charge of Assam. Rawat is the most senior Congress member in the state and we need to respect him rather than ignoring and targeting him. Barring few party members, others are with Rawat on the issue.”

Meanwhile, Congress state chief Pritam Singh has sought time from party chief in the first week of February. “We have sent the list of state committee, but some changes were there at the last minute. I will definitely discuss the issue with our national leadership and inform about the present situation in the state.”

On the other side, Hridayesh maintained that the list was made public after the consultancy of all senior leaders. “Our state chief is going to meet party chief and the issue will be discussed,” she said.

Nagpur: A 31-year-old city businessman, who had returned from China on January 6 and developed flu-like symptoms, was moved into a 7-bed quarantine ward at the Government Medical College and Hospital on Thursday.

The hospital swung into action with the special ward for suspected patients of novel Coronavirus (nCOv) after the man came there with the complaint. The patient is into car accessory business.

The hospital has also kept a section in Ward 25 ready for patients requiring treatment with serious viral infection.

“This patient was in Shanghai on business tour between December 26 and January 5. He was duly screened at the airports and was not found infected. As he developed flu-like symptoms now, he reported to us today,” said Dr Avinash Gawande, medical superintendent of GMCH.

The man, whose identity is being withheld, is showing the symptoms since last five days. This illness is generally due to viral infection. His samples have been sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune.

While doctors believe it is a “local infection”, the patient will remain in hospital till his reports arrive. Family-members of the patient stated he voluntarily decided to report to GMCH to keep the infection under control.

“The high dependency unit is ready at GMCH for such patients. There is no need to panic. People who have returned from China after January 1 and developed flu like symptoms should report to us as a precautionary measure,” Dr Gawande added.

The Indira Gandhi Government Medical College (IGGMC) too has kept two rooms in Ward no 6 reserved in case patients suspected nCoV patients land up at the hospital.

“IGGMC is yet to establish isolation ward for such patients. We have kept two rooms ready. Patients may report to any of the two GMCs,” said Dr Ajay Keoliya, dean of IGGMC.

Doctors said that there was a sudden increase in the number of patients with viral infections due to weather change in Nagpur. Such patients are infected with local influenza-A virus and need not panic or report to GMCs.

MADURAI: Except for sporadic cases, the number of dengue cases in Madurai has come down drastically in January compared to December, health officials have said.

“The number of dengue cases has come down to half. There is no particular dengue-affected area. Sporadic cases were however reported,” said a senior health official, adding that measures are in place to prevent dengue and its spread. Fogging, spraying abate solution and distributing nilavembu concoction in areas where dengue cases have been reported is done throughout the year by health officials. Officials told TOI that the cases are expected to come down further in February. “October to early January usually witnesses the highest number of dengue cases. This year, because of intermittent rains, the number of dengue cases was at its peak in November. Now, with no rains and drier climate, breeding of mosquitoes is less. However, work is still being done to eliminate any source of mosquito breeding that remain. There is no cause for concern,” said a source from the health department.

The source also added that the number of fever cases in the district had also declined in January. “The number of fever cases have also come down. Further hospitalisation has also decreased. January is seeing only 1/4th of fever admissions that was recorded in December. So, proportionately dengue cases have also reduced,” said the source. In 2019, only 18 dengue cases were reported between January and August.

325,['31/01/2020'],"Citizenship in sight, Sindhi family cries for daughter kidnapped in Pak","This story is from January 31, 2020

Nagpur: Shrichand Chandwani, who is getting his documents together to get Indian citizenship under CAA, also keeps two more papers handy — a birth certificate of his daughter Pooja, who is now 24 years old, and a police complaint filed back in Derki town of Sindh province in Pakistan after her abduction.

While he is keen to get an Indian passport, Shrichand also longs to be reunited with his daughter, who he claims was abducted by locals from a neighbouring village in Pakistan, and has now been converted to Islam. The birth certificate is to prove that Pooja was a minor of 16 years when she was taken away in March 2011, as mentioned in the police complaint. According to Pakistani law a minor cannot be married off even with her wishes. Shrichand hopes that Indian authorities take note and intervene in the matter to get her back.

Pooja’s abduction took place a year before that of Rinkle Kumari, which drew international limelight, but Pooja remain a forgotten footnote. The family alleges the involvement of a politician — Miya Abdul Haq aka Miya Mithu — in Pooja’s kidnapping. The politician is linked with many other cases too, they said.

“Around 8 to 10 armed persons, including a woman, barged into my house and dragged my daughter Pooja Kumari to a car,” says the report written in Sindhi language. “The complainant has alleged that his daughter has been abducted,” says a note below by the police with a seal on it.

“The real culprit was Kamran Khan, who is now her husband, living in the neighbouring village Lagar,” says Shrichand, who says that he knocked every door, from the local panchayat to the court, but in vain. “Finally, my daughter herself deposed against me saying that she went away willingly and we lost the case,” he says.

“They also kidnapped and confined me for three days. I was stripped off and beaten, leaving my private parts injured, and had to undergo a surgery. They brought my daughter to the hideout where I was kept. They threatened to wipe out our entire family if she did not cooperate,” he alleges.

Shrichand says they soon fled to India as he feared his other daughter would also meet the same fate. Initially, only he got the visa for India. Once here, he met the then home minister P Chidambaram with the help of Kailash Joshi, a BJP member of Parliament, he says, showing a letter. “Chidambaram promptly got the visas cleared, and my family shifted to India, finally reaching Nagpur,” he says. Now, the family is on a long term visa.

“We are ruined now. I had a mansion in Pakistan, here it is a dingy rented apartment. A cloth trader there, now I sell vegetables on a handcart,” he says.

“One needs money to travel back to Pakistan and plead the case for my daughter’s release. You have to spend at least Rs50,000 on a single trip and we are hand to mouth these days,” says his wife Shradha.

The last they could establish any contact with her was two-and-a-half years go on phone, says the family. “We left Pakistan soon after but could manage to establish contact with Kamran’s family through our relative there. It ended with a brief conversation with her. We have heard that she is a mother of three children now,” says the mother.

“In the court, she acted as if she does not recognize us at all,” she said. “It was because she was under threat,” adds Shrichand as he shoes a passport sized photo of Pooja, which is among the few memories of her left.

Kolkata: Forty-year-old Sankar Saha, who had almost lost his hands , returned home on Thursday with his limbs intact. Doctors at state-run SSKM Hospital had conducted the crucial replantation surgery .

The Belgharia resident’s both wrists got severed on January 7 as his hands accidentally went under the record cutting machine on which he was working at a printing press. His colleagues rushed him to hospital immediately. Two plastic surgery teams worked simultaneously on the two hands to conduct a successful bilateral replantation surgery the same day. On Thursday, Saha was discharged after doctors said they were confident that the patient would not develop any post-surgical infection .

“After this replantation surgery, the patient will need to undergo two or three minor surgeries to repair a few tendons. We plan to conduct the surgeries in about three months,” said plastic surgeon Souvik Adhikary, under whom the patient was admitted. He said they could not repair all the tendons during the replantation as the patient’s condition had become unstable after the 10-hour marathon surgery.

While Adhikary and his team worked on Saha’s right wrist, another team led by plastic surgeon Kalyan Das replanted the left wrist.

“The patient’s hands have been saved. Now, in addition to a few other minor surgeries, he will also need a series of rehabilitation, including physiotherapy so that he can start moving his hands again,” said Das.

“I have come this far after the accident because of the doctors at SSKM Hospital. They have not only saved my life but also my hands. I am confident that my hands will start functioning fully again,” Saha said. He, however, will not be able to start working immediately.

“It’s nothing short of a miracle. So far, the person under whom my husband works at the printing press has ensured all support including financial help. Otherwise it would have been very difficult for us as my husband is the only earning member in the family,” said wife Papiya.

327,['31/01/2020'],NU Senate members foil bid to suppress data loss,"This story is from January 31, 2020

Nagpur: On the day TOI exposed the big data loss of exam forms at Nagpur University (NU), several Senate members representing the students and teachers said they too were aware of the bungle which was cleverly kept under wraps by exam section under its director Prafulla Sabale.

Graduates constituency Senate member Manmohan Bajpai said several colleges had informed him about the data loss in mid-January which led him to seeking details of the incident from the varsity.

“I have placed questions regarding the data of 2019-20 summer exam forms during the upcoming Senate meeting in February. I came to know from colleges that they were asked to upload the details again as all data has been deleted by the private company Promarc,” Bajpai said.

Bajpai said while students and colleges are burdened with filling the forms again, possibilities of corruption and errors in hall tickets cannot be ruled out.

Bajpai, a lawyer by profession, also questioned the move to spend big amounts of university money on online system while Promarc’s poor performance continues.

“It is the duty of Promarc to have backup and safely save the students’ data. After switching to online system, students just had to opt the subjects and pay fee online. Now, fresh entries would have to be made,” he said.

Explaining the corruption angle, he said now colleges can claim all fee was paid in cases where transfer was pending or partially money was paid.

Another member Sarita Nimbarte said Promarc must be blacklisted now. “We have been highlighting poor performance of Promarc, but university was not ready to act. Our questions, critical of the company, are deliberately dropped during Senate meeting. Assurance to penalize the company have never been fulfilled though we have placed on record all bunglings by Promarc,” said Nimbarte, who comes from Gondia-Bhandara.

Senate member Keshav Mendhe held the exam section director responsible for the lapse. “We have never heard such issue cropping up before. The director doesn’t have proper knowledge about the online system and officials seem to be out of his control. Forms are missing, data is missing, college clerks are complaining the link is not working. This has become routine affair. This is biggest blunder in NU history,” he said.

Representing university teachers, member Omprakash Chimmankar said the company must be held responsible for the data loss. “It is expected of the company to have backup,” he said.

Vice-chancellor SP Kane didn’t answer to TOI’s calls.

In the last two Senate meetings, the members were assured that university would start fixing responsibility on Promarc for hall ticket, mark sheets and other online glitches. Yet, the NU has not taken any action against it till date.

328,['31/01/2020'],"Denied 2 ZP posts, NCP tie up with Cong on edge","This story is from January 31, 2020

Nagpur: The alliance between Congress and NCP in Nagpur Zilla Parishad is virtually over. The development has also potential to cause ripples at the state level also.

NCP had demanded two committees in the ZP, but Congress was ready to offer only one. Irked over the rejection, NCP headed by home minister Anil Deshmukh decided to not accept even this post. However, NCP member Ujjwala Bodare contested the election for the post of woman and child welfare committee chairperson and was elected. While NCP members along with Congress voted for Bodare, NCP leaders termed her as a rebel.

After results of Nagpur ZP election were out on January 7, Deshmukh had demanded the post of vice-president and one committee from Congress. Congress has 31 members in the House of 58 and does not need help of any other party to rule the ZP. NCP has only 10. The two parties had contested the ZP elections jointly.

Deshmukh wanted to make his son Salil the deputy chief and thus launch him in politics. However, dairy development minister Sunil Kedar refused to accede and the posts of president and vice-president went to the Congress. Deshmukh then demanded chairmanship of two committees from Kedar.

Talks were held between the two leaders several times including a prolonged meeting on Thursday morning, but the impasse remained. Both leaders stuck to their guns. Deshmukh finally decided to not be a part of the government by not taking even one post. He, however, formally did not end the alliance.

Even as talks were going on, NCP members filed nominations for two committees while Congress members filed for all four. After Deshmukh’s final decision, he asked NCP members to withdraw their nominations. While one of them complied with his diktat, Bodare refused. Sometime later, she was elected by Congress and NCP members.

NCP members told the media that Bodare had reached some understanding with Kedar. Shivraj Gujar, district NCP president, described Bodare as a rebel. “We had decided not to be the part of government and asked all our candidates to withdraw their nominations. I can’t say whether she has some understanding with Kedar. As for future of the alliance in Nagpur ZP, the decision will be taken by top party leaders,” he told TOI.

After NCP was denied the vice-president’s post, Deshmukh had accused Congress of not following the coalition dharma by not offering two committees to the alliance partner and warned of statewide repercussions.

329,['31/01/2020'],"Metro for one-way roads in Sitabuldi, shuttle at airport","This story is from January 31, 2020

Nagpur: After launching services on Reach 1 and 3, MahaMetro is now making efforts to push ridership by taking help of other agencies. It has made two proposals in this regard.

First is to make two roads in Sitabuldi one way that will enable city buses to stop under Sitabuldi Interchange. Second is to start shuttle services between city airport and Airport Metro station.

A MahaMetro officer said proposal had been submitted to Chinmay Pandit, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), to make roads from Variety Square to Munje Square and from Munje Square to Rani Jhansi Square one-way. Pandit told TOI he would approve the proposal soon.

As per proposal, traffic will only flow from Variety Square to Munje Square and from Munje Square to Rani Jhansi Square. “At present, about 5,700 vehicles move on these two roads every day. This makes them very crowded and there is no space for city buses to stop near Sitabuldi Interchange. We also want people to walk from Mor Bhavan bus terminus to Sitabuldi station. For this, there should be less traffic on these roads. If the roads are made one-way, the traffic would reduce to 2,700 vehicles per day. Thirty-nine city buses will stop below the station after that,” said the officer.

This proposal had been submitted to the then municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar who cleared it in November 2019. Now, it is with DCP (traffic).

Metro also wants Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to provide shuttle service from airport’s departure and arrival area to Airport Metro station. It has also spoken to two private agencies — Bengaluru-based Tvarit and Pune-based Kinetic — for providing this service.

The Metro officer said NMC has been asked to start mini-buses from airport to the Metro station and elsewhere. “The fare will be Rs10, which is minimal,” he added.

“Tvarit had submitted a proposal for providing e-vehicles at airport. They want to charge Rs25 per passenger and Rs50 per group. They are conducting a study there and elsewhere in the city too. Kinetic wants to charge Rs10 per passenger. They are also conducting a survey all over the city. However, for these plans to be successful, Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC) has to provide free parking to these vehicles. We have already submitted a proposal to MADC and a reminder too,” he said.

TRAFFIC FLOW

* Traffic will be allowed from Variety Square to Munje Square

* Traffic allowed from Munje Square to Rani Jhansi Square

* No traffic in reverse direction on both roads

* Will decongest the roads allowing city buses to halt under Sitabuldi Metro station

* Will also enable large number of people to walk from Mor Bhavan bus terminus to Sitabuldi Metro Station

330,['31/01/2020'],Mumbai: ‘My stated religion is compassion’,"This story is from January 31, 2020

Dr Anand Gokani, Gandhi’s great-grandson, at SIES College on Wednesday. He visited a pictorial exhibition and ... Read More

For the past 20 years, silver-haired diabetologist Dr Anand Gokani has been stating “compassion” as his religion in every official document. The habit has served him better than his friend in Delhi who wrote “Insaniyat” in the religion column of a form not too long ago. “He was arrested because the authorities had misread the Hindi word as ‘insanity’,” Gokani told a roomful of philosophy students on Tuesday before asking them if they too had the “courage” to write “compassion” as their official religion. Several hands went up in affirmation for the doctor who is the great-grandson of Mahatma Gandhi .

Ahead of his 72nd death anniversary, Gandhi seemed to leave an impression on at least 50 minds at Sion when Gokani—the grandson of his fourth son Ramdas—addressed students as part of a three-day event marking the 150th birth anniversary of the Mahatma, his great-granmother Kasturba Gandhi and 100 years of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.

At the start of the session organised by Sion’s SIES College of Arts, Science & Commerce along with the college’s Past Students’ Association and Matunga’s Guru Nanak Khalsa College , a philosophy student dressed like Kasturba found herself explaining what philosophy meant on Gokani’s behest.

Then, after dissecting the difference between “reputation” and “character” and invoking an Akbar-Birbal story, Gokani made students realise the nation continues to revere his patience-and-self-sufficiency-peddling great-grandfather because “the man stood for qualities that were as old as the hills”.

Prerana Desai, a petite Gandhian economist with a booming voice, described the leader in Hindi as someone who not only practised a non-violent revolution by inducing guilt among the colonisers and pride among the colonised but also challenged the economic status quo by boycotting mass-produced goods in favour of “goods produced by the masses”.

“Many critics now find it important to malign Gandhi as his principles question today’s staus quo and capitalism,” said Desai, whose speech even borrowed a take from the movie ‘Munnabhai’ about what to do when you get a slap on turning the other cheek.

Later, an unexpected Munnabhai-style spiel arrived when activist Ganesh Nochur described Gandhi’s spartan ways in casual Bambaiya Hindi that won him a handshake from a student.

“He never minced words or put on other people’s shoes and would stand his ground firmly, without chappal,” said Nochur about Gandhi’s clear stance against the Western idea of consumption.

“There is no other path left but his. He was a lighthouse on how to live,” said a middle-aged Nochur who invoked dying bees and polluted rivers to demonstrate how his generation had ruined the planet for the young.

“Sorry, you can’t even escape to Mars,” said Nochur, adding that he believes that luxury is reserved only for the likes of Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk.

Another unscripted moment was supplied by philosophy professor C D Sebastian who calls himself a “lover of Gandhi”.

In the middle of his impassioned take on Gandhi as someone who examined the consequences of things, when a few students stood up from their seats and moved to the other row, Sesbastian deadpanned: “You’re going to boycott me?”

Gokani's wife has already started boycotting him at events, saying she had seen him reduced to a showpiece by virtue of his lineage. Despite feeling like he was born with a “crown of thorns” and a bloodline he “must live up to”, Gokani continues to accept invitations to preach compassion out of some innate hope for change.

“Even if I can change five people in a room, it will have a ripple effect,” said Gokani. His great-grandfather would agree.

Autorickshaw drivers have created traffic nuisance at Variety Square

Nagpur: After getting first-hand experience of unruly autorickshaw drivers blocking traffic at busy Variety Square , municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe summoned deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Chinmay Pandit and directed him to check the menace.

On Thursday, Mundhe visited Variety Square to pay tributes to Mahatma Gandhi on his death anniversary when he witnessed how autorickshaws were blocking the flow of traffic.

One of the autorickshaw drivers even offered Mundhe to drop at his desired destination, eyewitnesses told TOI.

Angry over this, the new civic chief expressed anguish as to how the autorickshaw drivers were creating nuisance at one of the city’s most busiest intersections. “The municipal commissioner soon asked his officials to inform the matter to Nagpur city traffic police and also summoned DCP (traffic) to his office,” the eyewitnesses said.

TOI has been regularly highlighting how autorickshaw drivers create chaos at Variety Square and Rani Jhansi Square . They not only drive wrong side without fear of traffic police, but also create obstruction for other motorists while soliciting passengers.

At both these squares, the auto drivers blatantly jump the red signal, block free left turns and even a major portion of the road forcing motorists to criss-cross their way through the busy junctions, complained several harried citizens. The traffic police never paid any heed to the menace, they alleged.

Later in the afternoon, DCP traffic a and official from regional transport office visited the NMC headquarters and attended the meeting convened by the civic chief. Mundhe expressed anguish over the unruly autorickshaw drivers at such a busiest intersection in the city and stressed the need to streamline them.

Representatives from traffic police and RTO, Nagpur city, acknowledged the nuisance created by autorickshaw drivers. However, they were quick to put the blame on weak public transport system and lack of auto stands.

At present, the city has over 14,000 autorickshaws and only 317 stands for them. Some stands are encroached by roadside vendors, it was informed in the meeting. After a lengthy discussion, it was decided that the traffic police and RTO will soon conduct a joint survey to find out the status of existing autorickshaw stands.

64 delegations at Mundhe’s Janata Darbar

On Thursday, as many as 64 delegations met Mundhe over various issues during his Janata Darbar from 4pm to 5pm. Meanwhile, the civic administration succeeded in streamlining the otherwise haphazard parking of vehicles at its Civil Lines headquarters.

CHENNAI: More than 50% of first year students in engineering colleges were not able to clear Python programming language in the first semester exams for which results were declared on Tuesday. Of the 64,810 who appeared for the exam, only 31,044 cleared it (pass percentage 48%), according to Anna University.Python is a programming language, widely used in all emerging areas including artificial intelligence, machine learning and internet of things (IoT). To cater to industry demands, the university introduced it for first year students from 2017. But, this year, many colleges have recorded poor results in the subject. Private college principals said only a few colleges recorded more than 75% pass percentage in it, saying the question paper standard was very high. However, professors said the faculty members from these colleges lacked knowledge to teach the language.K Maran, director of Sairam Group of Institutions, said the question paper was tough. “First year students may not have exposure to programming. Faculty in many colleges lack training in Python,” he said, urging the university to standardise question papers.“Introducing Python for engineering students is a good move. Though Python is very easy, the question paper was tough and many colleges recorded poor results. The paper should have concentrated more on basics.

But the quality of students joining engineering courses has come down and the university should keep this in mind while setting question papers.”Anna University vice-chancellor M K Surappa said coding experts from software firms had to brought to train faculty in Python and coding skills.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: All three patients quarantined at Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital have tested negative for novel coronavirus (nCoV) and were discharged on Thursday.

“Their samples were sent for testing to NIV Pune and have tested negative,” said an Union health ministry official. The three men had self-reported at the Centre-run hospital designated to deal with such cases on Monday with complaints of respiratory trouble and fever.

Priya Abraham, director, National Institute of Virology, Pune, said, “Till now, 49 samples have been tested of which one has tested positive.” She added that the positive sample belonged to a student from Kerala who was studying in Wuhan.

With China struggling to contain the fast-spreading novel coronavirus, the Union health ministry had on Wednesday urged Indians to refrain from travelling to China. The advisory further urged all those travelling to China to monitor their health closely. A 24x7 helpline number (011-23978046) to redress any queries related to the respiratory infection has been set up. The ministry has also made four more laboratories functional, other than the NIV-Pune, for testing samples.

Several states, including Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan have kept some people with travel history to China under observation after they showed novel coronavirus-like symptoms. Meanwhile, scientists said they have been able to map the symptoms among 99 patients diagnosed with the infection in China.

According to a new analysis published in The Lancet, most patients were treated with anti-virals (75 ), antibiotics (70), and oxygen therapy (75), and had a good prognosis. However, 17 patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 11 of whom died of multiple organ failure.

334,['31/01/2020'],Smart City promises to save at least 35% trees,"This story is from January 31, 2020

Nagpur: It took a commonsensical approach by authorities and environmentalists to make certain that not all 139 trees would be on the chopping block. A joint inspection held on Thursday resulted in saving at least 30-35% of trees facing axe for making five road stretches in East Nagpur.

TOI was the first to report that authorities sought permission to cut 139 fully grown trees in different areas for Smart City Project roads. Opposing the move, green activists filed objection letters with the garden department of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC).

Following the opposition, a team of officials including Mahesh Moroney, deputy CEO of Smart City Project special purpose vehicle Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL), general manager (environment) Devendra Mahajan and others conducted a joint survey of the road stretches along with members of environment NGO Green Vigil Foundation.

The survey started at the approach road of Navkanya Nagar where three fully grown trees were proposed to be chopped off. After the site inspection, it was unanimously concluded that the trees need to be felled as they fall right in the middle of the proposed road.

Next in line was the stretch between Saduru factory to Bhavani Hospital in Pardi, where 68 trees were to be cut. However in a heartening news, officials decided to reduce the original road width of 18 metres to 15. “With this, we should be able to save around 40% of the trees on this route. These will include the ones situated on the edges,” said Moroney.

Officials took a similar decision for the road stretch from Bhandara National Highway to Punapur Road where 29 trees were to be cut. Again reducing the width to 15 metres, officials committed to save all the trees which are not coming in the middle of carriageway. “Trees which will not create any hindrance to vehicular movement will not be felled,” they said.

In addition to this, founder of Green Vigil Kaustav Chatterjee suggested not to cut trees coming on proposed pavement area. Agreeing to this, Mahajan said, “At some pavements where utility work needs to be carried out, it will become imperative to cut trees. However, we commit not to fell trees at rest of the footpaths.”

Against the felled trees, officials plan to carry out compensatory plantations in 1:5 ratio. They further expressed willingness to transplant ficus tree species in nearby open areas but members of Green Vigil dissented the idea, citing recent transplantation failures in the city.

At the end of survey, officials assured to bring down the number of felled trees to below 100. “We are working towards building a smart city in which sustainable development will play a crucial role,” said Moroney.

Welcoming the pro-environment move of officials, green activists stated that upcoming developmental projects should also incorporate such joint surveys. “During urban planning, focus should on protecting the existing green cover, especially the ecologically important tree species. All stakeholders should be involved in the decision-making process,” said Surbhi Jaiswal, team lead at Green Vigil.

The notification by the university sparked a row on the campus

SANTINIKETAN: The Visva-Bharati authorities on Thursday issued a notification , asking all teaching and non-teaching employees of the university not to make any statement on “matters pertaining to the university” to the media without permission from the university’s competent authority.

The notification, perceived to be a virtual “gag order” has sparked a row on the campus.

For the past few weeks, several employees of the university have been speaking in favour of the Left-leaning students protesting against CAA and other issues, including fee hike . A student was evicted for recording a speech by the vice-chancellor on CAA, alleged a section of students. On January 5, the agitators had gheraoed BJP MP Swapan Dasgupta when he was in the campus to speak on CAA.

In the wake of continuing unrest, VBU authorities had issued a notice on January 27 declaring the university’s Central Administrative Building including the area of Central Library as well as the academic and research section on campus as a no disturbance zone.

The notification directs all teaching and non-teaching staff of the university to air any public statement (on the institution) to the media through assistant registrar Anirban Sircar.

The notification states that it is unworthy of any staff member or employee of VB to seek the limelight through media. Declaring that VBU itself seeks no publicity, the notification makes it clear that genuine grievances of university staff will be sympathetically attended to by the authorities.

“This notification is against the Visva-Bharati statute. Such an order cannot be issued for university employees as the institution they serve is autonomous,” said Sudipta Bhattacharya, a professor of economics and president of the Visva-Bharati University Faculty Association ( VBUFA ). SFI ’s Somnath Sau said: “Vice-chancellor Bidyut Chakraborty is trying to clamp down on rights as basic as freedom of speech and expression.”

VBUFA has been speaking out in favour of the agitators and condemning the recent eviction of a student from the hostel.

Trichy: With the financial year coming to a close and only 40-50% of the non-tax revenue, earned by renting the civic body’s properties, having been collected, the Trichy Corporation has intensified collection of pending rent from the tenants.

So far, the corporation has sealed three shops in Ponmalai zone for non-payment of rent for the past 15-20 years now.

The corporation’s revenue sources include state grants, property tax, central finance commission and non-tax revenue. With around 2,500 buildings in four zones, it was earning around Rs 55 crore every year through the shops and buildings rented out to private as well as government offices. However, a section of the tenants has been defaulting from paying the pending monthly rent for several years.

“We are in the process of identifying major defaulters. Sine the defaulters are approaching courts, the recovery process is taking time,” an official source said.

On Wednesday, the Ponmalai zone of the civic body sealed a transport office functioning in the Central bus stand for non-payment of monthly rent amounting to Rs 15 lakh since 2004. Similarly, on Thursday a couple of shops operating in the same building were sealed.

The corporation rented out a 2,700-square-foot building on the Bharathiyar Road to a man in 2000 on monthly rental for Rs 18,000. The man was running two shops in the space. Since then, the tenant was periodically defaulting on the rent which accumulated to Rs 3 crore as on January 2020.

“Fresh notice is served to repay the pending rent. If not, we will auction the tenant’s belongings inside the building to recover the pending sum,” the official added.

Similar lock and seal method is planned in Srirangam and Ariyamangalam zones, sources said.

Trichy: The Panchayat Union Primary School at K Paramathi in Karur district has launched a unique storytelling programme for its students - an innovative practice for kids to nurture creativity and imagination skills through stories.

Vanithamani Arulvel, from Erode, in the inaugural storytelling session, shared among 189 children from classes I to V moral stories underlying the importance of eating vegetables and applying the presence of mind in critical situations.

“Creativity and vocabulary skills of the children will enhance on listening to stories as they tend to absorb words and imagine. They will also develop the patience to listen, a leadership quality,” Vanithamani Arulvel told TOI. Since the session was conducted completely in Tamil, the school management said the students were fully engrossed owing to the mother tongue connect.

School teachers said the children were enthusiastic throughout the session as the learning environment was different. “Stories often come with multiple moral values. In the absence of grandfathers and grandmothers, the storytelling practice is gradually declining, thus distracting students to other activities,” headmaster R Selvakannan said.

The school is building a story corner on their campus to conduct storytelling sessions periodically to engage students regularly to develop good virtues through moral stories. A couple of teachers from the school are being trained on storytelling to sustain the programme every week.

Ahmedabad: Historian Ramchandra Guha called the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), that was passed in the winter session of Parliament, “illogical, immoral and ill-timed”. Guha, also a biographer of Gandhi, delivered a public lecture on ‘What would Gandhi make of India today?’ in Ahmedabad on Saturday.

Speaking on Hindu-Muslim harmony as one of the four pillars of Gandhi’s idea of Swaraj, Guha said, “Even if Gandhi had never existed, any morally upright consciences, democratic citizens who believe in the Constitution, would non-violently oppose CAA. The act is illogical, immoral and ill-timed.”

“It is illogical because it completely excludes the largest group of refugees in India who have travelled from Sri Lanka, many of whom are actually Hindus. It is immoral because its entire phrasing discriminates against one community, Muslims. In conjunction with the National Register of Citizens (NRC), it makes any Indian Muslim fearful and insecure,” Guha added.

“Look at the phrasing. It is as if we have many neighbours but only those that are Muslim majority are discriminating and every refugee except someone who is a Muslim is welcome here. It is absolutely immoral. I am no constitutional expert, but even if the Supreme Court upholds it, it should be resisted because it is utterly immoral,” Guha said.

Guha also termed the Act be ill-timed, saying, “It is ill-timed because of the perennial state of the country now, unemployment levels at a 45-year high, agrarian distress, all kinds of other issues to be solved…Of course, Gandhi would have opposed it.”

About the CAA in the context of the northeast India, Guha said, “The Northeast is a part of India which always had difficulties because of geographic isolation.”

Ahmedabad: Citizens who do not agree with the civic body’s assessment of their property tax can now appeal for a reassessment. A web page will be launched by the civic body to accept requests from citizens for a reassessment of the carpet area of their respective properties. The launch of the facility will be soon announced claim Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) officials.

When asked how much time it will take AMC to solve such queries, AMC standing committee chairman, Amul Bhatt, replied , “It will take 30 to 35 days for a zonal officer to visit a premise, prepare a report to verify claims and then proceed with making changes in the tax bills.” He added, “A number of disputes over reassessment has reached civil courts. The whole idea of bringing in the carpet area based tax formula was minimising such litigations. But here too we find there is a conflict between our property tax office and individual property owners.”

It was in May 2014 that the then municipal commissioner Guruprasad Mohapatra had announced introducing a system of e-assessment for filing property tax. The scheme failed to take off after Mohapatra was transferred out of the civic body. The e-assessment system is followed in Bengaluru civic body.

AHMEDABAD: They used luxury cars and lived in posh localities, topped exams or raised two generations of children, but on Thursday morning, they all stood together in white clothes with heads shaven. A total of 24 men and women, youth and children took diksha (renunciation orders) from Acharya Vijaymuktiprabhsuri at a major ceremony held at the Sabarmati riverfront .

The ‘mumukshu’ (ascetics to be) included 10 from Mumbai, six from Ahmedabad and one each from Anand, Pune, Ladol, Karad, Ujjain, Bengaluru, Vapi and Surat. The event, held at ‘Vairagya Rangotsav Mandap’ on the Riverfront, saw 10,000 guests from across India and 300-odd Jain sadhus and sadhvis.

The acharya, in his speech, said self-control comes from observing one’s thoughts, acts and speech. “One who leaves home becomes a sadhu but the one who leaves old thoughts become a shishya (disciple),” he said.

On Wednesday, those taking diksha were taken out in a procession in the Paldi area in great regalia, but at 5pm on Thursday, the rites began for them to shave their heads and don the white clothes of renunciants. They were given new identities by the acharya.

“Those who took diksha included six members of a single family from Mumbai including Sandeep Jain, his wife Sejal, daughter Labdhi and son Vajra. Jain’s mother and brother had taken diksha earlier,” said an organizer, adding that those renouncing social life range from a 14-year-old boy to an 88-year-old woman.

Several of the senior citizens who took diksha said that it was their long-cherished dream to spend the twilight of their lives studying religious scriptures and understanding dharma. Sushila Shah, who was given the new name Sadhvi Paramgunashree, was inspired by her daughter, who had become a sadhvi a few years ago.

Thanjavur: Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has initiated a project to encourage all places of worship to adopt and maintain food safety and hygiene in the preparation and distribution of ‘prasadam’, FSSAI chairperson Rita Teaotia said.

After inaugurating a modern food testing laboratory-cum training centre on the Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology (IIFPT) campus in Thanjavur on Thursday, Rita said that global food safety has to be ensured in the country by promoting modern food safety practices. It has been a big challenge to cover the population of 1.35 billion people with minimum facility and resources in the country.

While speaking about BHOG (Blissful Hygienic Offering to God) project, she said that the places of worship are a very important part of Indian society and food served at these places is regarded as pure and sacred. Food safety measures also need to be implemented at such places. “FSSAI has initiated a project to encourage all places of worship to adopt and maintain food safety and hygiene in the preparation of prasadam. All the places of worship that distribute prasadam, including vendors are required to obtain FSSAI licence or registration and they also need to follow the sanitary and hygiene practices as per the food safety standards regulations. In this context, IIFPT has signed an MoU with the managements of Brihadeeswarar Temple, Punnainallur Mariamman Temple and Shirdi Saibaba Temple in Thanjavur for ensuring safe distribution of prasadam,” she said.

Earlier, IIFPT officials signed an MoU with temple managements for safe distribution of prasadam in the presence of FSSAI chairperson Rita Teaotia. Over 700 people participated in an awareness campaign organized during the event on ‘Eat Right India’. tnn

Kannur: Amid uncertainty over the implementation of Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which is yet to come into effect, the amended application form for applying for citizenship has appeared online , and new applicants have started use it.

Though the Union government has said the amended act has not come into force, the application form downloaded from the website of the Ministry of Home Affairs has asked a specific question as part of a sub section (7A). The question — Do you belong to one of the minority communities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, namely Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christian religion? Yes/No If Yes, Please specify... — was not there in the earlier application form, according to legal experts.

Kannur collectorate has got three such applications. All are from Panoor area and they have applied for citizenship as one of their parents earlier had Pakistani citizenship, but now holds Indian citizenship.

One resident of the district has submitted the citizenship request in the amended form as he is a Pakistan citizen by birth but living here since 2008.

The youth filed the application on January 14, after he turned 18 on January 11. His father, an Indian citizen, had migrated to Pakistan for business and married a Pakistani woman there. In 2002, the applicant was born in Pakistan. In 2008, they came back and his mother got Indian citizenship. So naturally the youth can get citizenship, but he was worried since he was born in Karachi, and has a Pakistan passport, said P R Vinod, his lawyer. When he applied online for Indian citizenship, the amendment was noticed, and after filling it, he submitted three sets of the application as per the norms, at the collectorate and got the acknowledgement as well, the lawyer said.

The reports that registration as per CAA has begun in Kannur is baseless, said district collector TV Subhash. He said the mailing section of the collectorate got three applications on January 23, but no action has been taken.

The applicant’s lawyer also said the same, and added the application was submitted as per procedure. But this has brought to the fore the fact that the state government cannot do anything with regards to such issues, he added.

NASHIK/DHULE: The Dhule police have arrested more than 36 people so far in connection with the riots and arson on Wednesday. They had earlier booked more than 5,000 people for violence during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

“The police first acted swiftly to bring the city to normalcy. Now it has started the operation to look for the individuals engaged in arson and stone-pelting. We have arrested 36 people and the search for their accomplices is on,” said sub-divisional police officer Sachin Hiray.

On Wednesday, the protesters — supporting the bandh called by various organisations against the CAA, NRC and NPR — had turned violent and had started pelting stones on houses and public property at the 100-feet road in the city.

“Inspector-General, Nashik Range, Chhering Dorje visited Dhule against the backdrop of the riots and instructed the police to take severe action against the individuals who took the law in their hands. Hence, the action,” said police sources.

Lending support to CAA, NRC and NPR protests, the demonstrators had first struck the National Highway 3 at Chalisgaon phata and had attempted to stop the traffic. The police foiled the attempt for two hours as people kept turning up at intervals of 10-15 minutes at various places. Thereafter, the protesters gathered at the 100-feet road at 12.30 pm and started pelting stones on the houses, vehicles and public properties. They torched a couple of two-wheelers and tyres. The police tried to intervene, but the stones were pelted at them as well. The police finally had to open fire to disperse the crowd. Two rounds were fired in the air and six rounds of tear gas shells were burst followed by light use of charge, after which the crowd dispersed.

The situation in most parts of the Dhule city was normal except for a section where window panes of three buses were targeted. The police claimed that none of the citizens, except the policemen, were injured during the violence. Cases have been registered against the office-bearers of the Bhim Army , Samvidhan Bachav Samiti and their accomplices at the Chalisgaon, Dhule City and Shirpur police stations. The police are going through video recordings and photographs.

351,['31/01/2020'],‘Want NIA probe into funding of protests’,"This story is from January 31, 2020

Kochi: The Ernakulam unit of Janajagarana Samithi has alleged that the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests in the state received foreign funding and the central government should initiate an NIA investigation into it. The samithi recently landed in a controversy after a viral video showing a mob pushing a woman out of a hall and being verbally abused during a pro-CAA meet at Pavakulam temple on January 21.

During a press meet held by the samithi’s district convener C G Kamalanandan and C V Sajini, secretary of the industrial cell of the Bharatiya Janata Party, here alleged that the recent CAA protests reminded of those youths in Kashmir who pelted stones at the central forces for money.

“Anti-national elements like SDPI and Popular Front of India (PFI) are unnecessarily creating ruckus during the peaceful pro-CAA rallies, held by Sangh Parivar constituents in Eloor and Pathalam, by using provocative and violence-inciting statements. The same has happened during our rally held in Aluva on January 27. Jihadi’s are also calling for boycotting shops and institutions run by Hindus. All these incidents show that people with vested interests are trying to create riots and communal divisions,” said Kamalanandan.

Referring to the incident at Pavakkulam temple, Sajini alleged that the police officers investigating the case are facing political pressure.

“All these are fake news. The woman who trespassed into the hall and interrupted our meeting received help from others who have vested agenda. The person who took the video of the scuffle was her accomplice and the entire scene was preplanned. We have submitted all the evidence including videos of the event and CCTV footages in the premises to the police, but we assume they have pressure from outside,” she said.

Sajini and Kamalanandan, during the press meet, denied that police have registered cases and made arrests, and called it “fake news”.

Meanwhile, Ernakulam North police have arrested and released on bail five activists of Sangh Parivar in connection with the incident. The charges against them include unlawful assembly, rioting, voluntarily causing hurt, criminal intimidation, use of obscene words, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman. Earlier, cases were registered against 29 persons.

Thanjavur: The Hindu religious and charitable endowment (HR&CE) department on Thursday reinstated the renovated and gold-coated ‘kalasam’ atop the main ‘gopuram’ in Brihadeeswarar Temple (Big Temple) ahead of the consecration ceremony, to be held on February 5.

As part of the consecration ceremony, authorities of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) along with HR&CE started cleaning the temple, including the main gopuram a few months ago.

Scaffolding has been erected above the main sanctum sanctorum covering the tower to facilitate the workers to perform chemical cleaning. The HR&CE officials started cleaning the giant ‘kalasam’ fixed atop the 216ft tower (main gopuram) on January 5.

The kalasam, which is 3.81m (12.5ft) tall, is being erected above the centre of the ‘vimanam’ (granite block). Nearly 25 tonne of copper is used to cover it.

A group of artisans cleaned it and did the gold-coating. It was brought to the temple and a special puja was performed before fixing it atop the gopuram.

Earlier, a team of experts including M Amirthalingam, faculty of Metallurgical and Materials department of IIT Madras, inspected the condition of the kalasam on January 5. The inner portion of the kalasam was filled with ‘varagu’ millet. Scientists from Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research also examined the kalasam after it was brought down.

MK Stalin

THANJAVUR: V K Dhivaharan , brother of V K Sasikala, a close aide of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa and now undergoing imprisonment in Parappana Agrahara jail in Bengaluru, surprised everyone on Thursday by describing DMK president MK Stalin as the future leader of Tamil Nadu and the next chief minister of the state. His speech set off speculation about his possible switching over to the DMK camp.

“Stalin is the opposition leader today. He will be the chief minister tomorrow,” Dhivaharan said, while adding that only Stalin can uphold the Dravidian principles. He shared the stage with Stalin at a wedding in the family of Thanjavur DMK MP SS Palanimanickam .

The situation in Tamil Nadu has worsened and Tamils are being treated as second rate citizens. It has even emboldened a man from Karnataka (referring to actor Rajinikanth ) to speak against Periyar. “Such a situation has risen because Dravidian stalwarts have passed away, one after another. Tamil and Tamil Nadu are important for us and Stalin is the only leader who can safeguard them and we all should back him,” Dhivaharan said.

Touching upon the results of the recent rural local body polls, he said, had DMK leaders been more vigilant they could have secured almost 85% of the seats. But, AIADMK had snatched them away in several places,"" he said. As if queering the pitch further, Stalin while addressing the gathering, cited a recent speech at a marriage function, by BJP leader PT Arasakumar, who after praising him, had since joined the DMK. “I do not know, where Dhivaharan will be headed to next,” Stalin said.

""Only because of our vigilance, we were able to secure this success. Had the polls been conducted in a free and fair manner, we could have achieved 90% success"", Stalin said, countering Dhivaharan’s observation about laxity on the part of DMK leaders.

While the developments set off speculations about Dhivaharan, who is the general secretary of Anna Dravidar Kazhagam (ADK), switching camps, his son and party youth wing leader Jeyanandh Dhivakaran denied any such move. “It was a wedding in the family of a DMK leader and it will be inappropriate to talk about the three-decade old political feud between the two camps. Honouring the host is in our culture,” Jeyanandh said in a post on social media.

“If AIADMK ‘split’ is not sorted out, it will happen eventually is the message to AIADMK cadre. Just a wake up call to them about the reality,” Jeyanandh told TOI, when asked about Dhivaharan naming Stalin as the next chief minister.

NASHIK: The Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation (NMSCDCL) has prepared five different maps for the township project under the town planning scheme. The smart city company has put these maps on display and sought feedback from the farmers .

The maps are to be sent to the director of the town planning department of the state government for its technical approval. NMSCDCL will invite suggestion and objection by the farmers after technical approval by the state’s town planning department.

NMSCDCL chairman and senior IAS officer, Sitaram Kunte, said efforts are being made to complete the project within the deadline. “The suggestions and objections are to be sought after the final approval to the draft and maps of the township project by the office of the director of the state town planning department. The project will be cancelled if more than 50% farmers or land owners oppose the project,” added Kunte.

The smart city company has proposed greenfield township project over 753 acres in Makhmalabad area of the city. The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) is a planning authority of the project. The land is to be acquired under the town planning (TP) scheme project, similar to the model implemented in Gujarat.

Some farmers recently met municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game, opposing the project. “These 400 farmers, who are opposing the project, have around 50 hectares. The remaining farmers owning 700 hectares have given their consent to give their land,” he said.

Game reiterated that he himself will cancel the township project if more than 50% of total farmers or land owners oppose the project.

Thiruvananthapuram: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said here on Thursday that artists can no longer remain in an ivory tower but must get involved in the struggle for safeguarding freedom and other democratic values. Pointing out that freedom was facing serious threats in the country, he said, “Creative people can longer confine themselves to their creative work only. They can no longer be dismissive about activism. The dividing line between artists and activists is fast getting blurred. In this age of oppression, there can be no artists and activists in its puritan sense. There are only ‘artivists’,” while inaugurating the third edition of Mathrubhumi International Festival of Letters.

He also said that literature festivals in Kerala were a pride of India in general and Kerala in particular. Some Malayalam books published in recent times have crossed 110 editions in no time, he said. “Malayalam is a language to which the weighty works of leading writers in English, Spanish or any other major language get translated without delay. Jean-Paul Sartre, who propounded the theory of existentialism, probably had more fans in Kerala than in France itself,” he said.

The CM also took a dig at foreign journalists who berated Indian reading habits. “An international weekly has said that Indians as a society is yet to evolve a culture of serious book reading. The editor of the weekly, I am sure, wouldn’t have come to such a conclusion had he been to Kerala and exposed his good self to a string of annual book festivals various publishers host here. I am only happy to have him in Kerala,” the CM said, referring to a report in Guardian Weekly on the recently-concluded Jaipur lit fest.

MUMBAI: Away from family, friends and besieged by information about a raging new virus, this Kalyan man (36) spent this past week in isolation at Kasturba Hospital, Chinchpokli, for suspected novel coronavirus (nCoV).Speaking to TOI following his discharge on Thursday, the father of two said he was relieved to have not carried the infection home.The sales executive and his 31-year-old female colleague from Nalasopara, who had both travelled to China for work, were the first from the city to be isolated at Kasturba on January 23. He had volunteered to meet local doctors after his cold and cough persisted for 24 hours on his return from China’s Guangzhou where he spent six days.“There were moments of euphoria, panic and frustration in the last seven days (of quarantine). The fact that little is known about the virus and how to treat it scared us. We were constantly reading about cases and deaths in China on our phones. When the first report came negative, I was filled with relief and excitement,” he said, adding that staying in touch with loved ones helped him cope with the isolation. The authorities then decided to carry out the second round of tests. “However, they refused to discharge us even after the second test reports arrived on January 28... We got frustrated and anxious.”The Kalyan man recalled that everything was normal when they landed in China on January 16. “By the time we returned, though, things had changed. The Wuhan outbreak had become big. The airport was teeming with people in masks,” he said. “The temperature there was 10 degrees and I had a cold”He said nurses checked on them at least three times a day donning protective gear. “Quality of food was alright but there is room for improvement in cleaning of dishes. The rooms were cleaned multiple times in a day,” he said. “I would urge all with symptoms to seek medical advice.”",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73786789,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-572580,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/home-after-7-day-isolation-for-ncov-kalyan-man-relieved/articleshow/73780589.cms

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: Even though the state government stated before the Gujarat high court that the rule of wearing helmet compulsorily was always there, the cops are still in a dilemma as to whether implement it or not as they haven’t received any instructions from the government.

Sources in the city traffic police said that the government had not sent any circular for helmet rule implementation, but they kept getting conflicting instructions.

“Whenever the government made any announcement for implementation of the rule or to give relaxation, we were given instructions. So, we fined two-wheeler riders for not wearing helmets as and when the government wanted,” said a traffic police cop deployed in the Navrangpura area.

The cop said that when they implemented the helmet rule strictly, people began wearing it to avoid hefty fines. But when the government later relaxed the implementation, people again stopped wearing helmets.

Another traffic policeman said that they have to implement the rule and invite conflict with people who were unaware of the changing stance of the government.

“We are all likely to impose fines on two-wheeler riders found without helmets from February 1,” said the cop.

Joint commissioner of police, J R Mothalia said that he did not know about the high court proceedings, and will take decision on implementation of the helmet rule only after detailed study of the court order.

On asked about the government’s affidavit which states that the rule to wear helmets was always there, Mothalia said that he was not aware of that affidavit and will prefer to go through the court order before speaking on the issue.

Deputy commissioner of police, traffic (West), Ajit Rajian said that he will seek clarification on the court’s order before implementing the helmet rule.

367,['31/01/2020'],Game pulls up civic officials over pendency of grievances,"This story is from January 31, 2020

The new application lets citizens choose from a list of the top 10 grievances or type a different complaint

NASHIK: Municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game has pulled up civic officials over pending grievances of the citizens.

Grievances related to various departments like water supply, sanitation, electric, health and garden are being filed by citizens through the NMC e-connect mobile application. And over 500 grievances related to various departments are still pending.

During a recent meeting with the head of departments, Game took the officials to task. “Many online grievances are pending. I have directed all the officials to speed up the disposal of pending cases,” Game said.

In 2014, the municipal corporation had launched Smart Nashik App to help citizens in filing complaints. Later, the then municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe had directed the officials to make the app more citizen-friendly. Accordingly, the Smart Nashik App was restructured and was newly launched on March 1, 2019, with a new name: NMC e-connects.

This new application lets citizens choose from a list of the top 10 grievances or type a different complaint. Earlier, junior-level officials were involved in the grievance redressal process. But in the new app, the officials in-charge of addressing the grievances are divisional officers, heads of the departments, additional municipal commissioner and municipal commissioner.

Game has instructed all the HODs to ensure that all online grievances are cleared on the same or next day. They should also ensure that no cases remain pending.

“Maintenance of the garden near Guru Gobind Singh College is not being carried out by the NMC. I filed an online complaint in this regard 15 days ago, but the civic administration has not done anything,” social activist Jalbir Singh said.

Game also reviewed the biometric attendance system of the civic employees. Currently, 58 devices have been provided to the civic administration for bio-metric attendance. Still most of the employees are still not using this new system.

The Municipal commissioner directed the civic administration to withhold the salaries of the employees who are not using the bio-metric attendance.

368,['31/01/2020'],It’s final! Helmets are compulsory in Gujarat,"Wearing a helmet is compulsory for two-wheeler riders in Gujarat

AHMEDABAD: Wearing a helmet is compulsory for two-wheeler riders in urban areas and there has been no change in the law in Gujarat in this regard. The state government finally put these words on to paper before the Gujarat high court on Thursday, in response to a PIL that exposed the government’s doublespeak on the subject, one thing on paper and the other in practice.The high court disposed of the PIL but not without quashing a circular issued by the commissioner of transport on December 5, 2019, in which all RTOs and ARTOs were told that the use of helmets by two-wheeler riders was optional in municipal limits. This circular was apparently issued after the government issued a press note announcing a temporary relaxation in the rules pertaining to helmets.The petitioner, Sanjeev Ezhava, pointed out in his PIL that the Gujarat government had relaxed the mandatory helmet rule in urban areas, contrary to provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act , which was amended and made more stringent by the Centre in September 2019.The principal secretary of the ports and transport department, Kamal Dayani, filed an affidavit informing the HC that the PIL was “mis-founded and filed without verifying correct records”. The affidavit asserted, “The state government has not issued any order or notification making wearing of protective headgear optional for every driver and pillion rider.” It was also submitted that the state government had in July 2016 done away with the exemption granted to women and children riding pillion from the compulsory helmets rule.The government also cited its communication with the Supreme Court’s committee on Road Safety and submitted that it was informed on January 7 that the Gujarat government had not set any new standard for helmets. The government, in fact, said that the newspaper reports carried reports about a public demand for relaxing the mandatory helmets rule, but no official decision was taken by the government.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73787586,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-653621,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/helmets-are-compulsory-govt-reiterates-in-hc/articleshow/73782151.cms
369,['31/01/2020'],"Smuggled firearms embolden trigger-happy, gun-toting criminals","This story is from January 31, 2020

Bhopal: In a disturbing trend in the state capital, several firing incidents have been reported in the last few days. In the first 20 days 0f 2020, half a dozen firing incidents have been reported in the city. Sources claim that due to the easy availability of firearms in the city, not only the hardcore gangsters, the small-time miscreants too possess pistols and openly use them in petty disputes. Along with single shot 'kattas', sophisticated country-made pistols, which can fire multiple shots, are also being smuggled in Bhopal in large numbers and supplied to college students and miscreants at cheap rates.

The craze for guns has been on the rise among youngsters; recently police registered a case against three youth for posting their selfies with illegal guns on social media. And gun runners are out to exploit this fetish for quick money. If a novice contacts them, they charge anything between Rs 15000 to Rs 25000 for the illegal firearms, although these illegal pistols are usually sold for Rs 3000 to Rs 12000 in the city through discreet contacts.

Police sources, requesting anonymity, maintained that situation has become worse because there have been no major seizures of firearms in the city recently. Sources also claimed that some of the senior officers and special city police units formed to investigate such cases have not tracked the real source of seized firearms, which could have led to busting of the gang of firearm suppliers. In 2019, police had registered 1510 cases under Arms Act and seized 28 ‘kattas’, 27 pistols, six revolvers and 80 cartridges.

Retired CSP Salim Khan, who conducted major drives and seized a large number of firearms during his tenure, told TOI that police must launch a major drive against suppliers of illegal guns. Cops will have to find the source of firearms coming in the city and track the supply chain and stop it. He also said that this process must be repeated at regular intervals.

Khan said illegal firearms are supplied in the city mostly from Khargone and Dhar by the notorious ‘Sikligars’. Another route of firearms supply is from Uttar Pradesh via Morena and Bhind. There are a number of suppliers in the bordering districts who smuggle firearms in the city. A senior cop, wishing anonymity, said unemployment and urge to become powerful draws youngsters to guns. Posing with pistols has become a craze on social media and many city youths can be seen holding guns in their profile pictures. He added that everyday young professionals and businessmen approach police in large numbers to get a gun licence. He also emphasised that planned drive against illegal firearms has to be conducted to control this problem.

Ex-DGP Dinesh Chandra Jugran said a lot of youngsters, influenced by movies and social media, are lured to carry pistols with them to create an impression on their peers. He said that psyche of the youth is changing because of many factors in the present scenario, which have a cumulative effect on people. Jugran also said that cops have to play a vital role in controlling the menace and ensure that it doesn't spread. There has to be a minute checking of vehicles on the city borders and inside the city. Police needs to step up new strategies to control this free use of illegal weapons.

ASP (crime branch) Nishchal Jharia admitted that number of people possessing firearms just for craze has gone up, ‘although they don’t use them’. DIG Irshad Ali, however, said that average number of firing incidents had decreased gradually last year, compared to the previous two years. He denied that firearms are being smuggled in the city and added, “Illegal firearms used by the accused in recent firing incidents were with them for years and even decades.”

Nashik: With mercury dipping to 7.9 degrees celsius on Thursday, the city is once again reeling under cold wave-like conditions.

The recorded minimum temperature was 6 degrees below normal and was lowest in the state on Thursday. Earlier, the city had recorded season’s minimum temperature at 6 degrees celsius on January 17, but the minimum temperature again went up to 15 degrees celsius in the following days.

According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), the northerly winds have penetrated North Maharashtra and that has led to drop in the minimum temperature. “The minimum temperature of Nashik city will be below 10 degrees celsius for a day or two and will increase gradually thereafter,” an IMD official said.

“We were feeling warm for the past few days, but suddenly felt the cold on Thursday morning. I was out for jogging and this is a really good time to exercise,” Pratik Salunke, who works in a private firm, said.

The Malegaon tehsil town recorded a minimum temperature of 10 degrees celsius while the maximum was recorded at 26.2 degrees celsius.

North Maharashtra’s Jalgaon city recorded a minimum temperature of 8.5 degrees celsius on Thursday — 3 degrees below normal. However, the maximum temperature of the city was recorded at 28.4 degrees celsius.

The minimum and maximum temperatures for Ahmednagar city on Thursday were recorded at 9.7 degrees and 27.8 degrees, respectively.

According to Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth in Rahuri, Niphad taluka — the grape-growing belt — recorded a minimum temperature of 6 degrees celsius on Thursday. The taluka has recorded season’s lowest temperature at 2.4 degrees celsius on January 17.

PUNE: The state irrigation department has undertaken the repair and strengthening works at eight critical spots on Mutha right bank canal to prevent seepage and weakening of its wall.The repairs were carried out near Janata Vasahat , where the canal wall had breached in September 2018, Swargate, Vadgaon, Dhayari and Pulgate, among others, after water discharge into the canal was stopped.In addition to the strengthening work, the irrigation department also removed silt and huge piles of garbage from the canal’s channel to ensure uninterrupted water flow.The Mutha canal , which carries water to the rural areas starts from Khadakwasla dam, covers about 24km distance up to Phursungi. It flows via Sinhagad Road, Dhayari, Janata Vasahat, Parvati, Swargate, Sopanbaug and Hadapsar .Officials in the irrigation department said the canal’s wall was damaged at various spots because of encroachments over the years and construction of ramps. During inspections, it was seen that most spots located within the city limits required repairs and srengthening works, which were undertaken in last one month, the officials said.About 11,345 cubic metres of banking work was carried out at these eight spots, of which most work was done at Vadgaon followed by Dhayari and Swargate stretches. All the possible spots in Janata Vasahat area were also plugged.“Banking work is vital as it includes maintaining adequate width of the canal wall. Till now, the department was not able to carry out repairs on such a large scale because the canal had continuous flow of water. Once the water was stopped, the mechanical department team was able to reach to the bottom of the canal. Though the seepage has not stopped completely as it requires more minute work, it has reduced considerably after the repairs,” an irrigation department official said.He said about 4,996 cubic metres of silt was removed from various spots of the canal to ensure better flow of water. “Similar works have now been extended beyond the city limit ahead of Phursungi,” the official added.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73798089,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-570922,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/irrigation-dept-repairs-eight-critical-spots-in-mutha-canal/articleshow/73780697.cms

Ganga Yatra takes precedence over teaching in schools

LUCKNOW: Government teachers posted in 10 primary schools in UP’s Hardoi district have been directed to provide hospitality to the delegation participating in ongoing Ganga Yatra .

An order (a copy is with TOI) was issued by block education officer (BEO) of Bilagram in Hardoi asking teachers and cooks working in 10 primary schools to ensure accommodation and food to Ganga Yatris.

The four-day Ganga Yatra, which took off from Bijnor and Ballia on January 27, reached Hardoi on Thursday. The yatra will culminate in Kanpur on Friday.

The yatra aims at increasing awareness on Ganga cleanliness and rejuvenation. “According to the letter of the district basic education officer dated 28/01/2020, participants of the Ganga Yatra will have a night stay (on January 30) in gram panchayats near the banks of Ganga. Teachers and cooks of schools mentioned below should provide lodging and food to the delegation,” the order said.

Four primary schools of Bilagram and six of Sandi block of Hardoi were mentioned in the order.

The order, however, did not go down well with teachers. “For anything happening in the state, be it bridal makeover for mass marriage, pulse polio campaign, updating of voter list, they (government) assign responsibility to us. And now we have to take care of Ganga Yatris. How do they expect us to impart quality education,” asked a teacher.

Repeated attempts to contact basic shiksha adhikari (BSA), Hardoi, Hemant Rao failed. He also did not reply to messages sent by TOI.

The order came days after government teachers in Siddharthnagar district were assigned duties to do bridal makeover for brides getting married under the government’s mass marriage programme.

However, after the order went viral on social media, basic education officer of Siddharthnagar Surya Kant Tripathi cancelled the order issued by block officer and proposed an inquiry against him.

Thiruvananthapuram: Turning down the recommendations by chief secretary to reinstate IAS officer Sriram Venkitaraman back to service, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan ordered that his suspension period be extended by another three months.

The order comes in the wake of his suspension period completing six months this week. As per the rules, the period of suspension of a member of the All India Service on charges other than corruption can go up to a maximum of one year, during which the inquiry against him should be completed and appropriate order should be issued failing which the suspension order will automatically stand revoked.

Despite holding four sittings and recording the statements of all those who have been mentioned in the police report, the departmental inquiry that was initiated against Venkitaraman could not prove that he was drunk while driving the car that rammed the motorcycle of journalist Muhammed Basheer, resulting in his death. The departmental inquiry commission headed by principal secretary (industries) Sanjay Garg which gave a report to the government citing that the charges against Venkitaraman could not be proved, had to reach the conclusion because of the grave error on the part of the police of delaying the medical test on the officer to check presence of alcohol in the blood.

The extension of his suspension comes as a prelude to police chargesheet, which is likely to be filed in a day or two.

Representative image

PUNE: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) moved an application on Wednesday before the special UAPA court here seeking transfer of all the records and proceedings related to the Elgar Parishad case to the special NIA court in Mumbai.

Special UAPA judge S R Navander is expected to hear the NIA plea on February 3 and has called for written submissions from the state and the nine activists arrested so far in the case.

Special public prosecutor Ujjwala Pawar told TOI, “The NIA had approached the court with their lawyer to file the application. As of now, we have no instructions from the investigating officer or any other state authority. Unless I get instructions, I won’t appear in the matter.”

On the written submission sought from the state, Pawar said, “The investigating officer will file the say. We will wait for instructions.”

The lawyers appearing for the arrested activists said notices for written submissions had been served on them directly at the Yerawada central jail, where they are currently lodged under judicial custody.

One of the defence lawyers told TOI, “While we are yet to receive a copy of the NIA application, we have gone through its contents. Among other things, the letter mentions re-registration of an FIR by the NIA in Mumbai on January 27.”

He said, “The UAPA charges have been invoked in the matter, nine activists have been arrested and two chargesheets have been filed so far.”

It is the Pune police’s case that the Elgar Parishad held on December 31, 2017, at Shaniwarwada was funded and supported by the banned CPI (Maoist) organisation as part of a conspiracy to create unrest and overthrow the government. Alleged inflammatory speeches at the conclave contributed to the January 1, 2018, caste riots at Koregaon Bhima .

Since June 6, 2018, nine activists — Sudhir Dhawale , Rona Wilson, Surendra Gadling, Shoma Sen, Mahesh Raut, P Varavara Rao, Sudha Bharadwaj, Arun Ferreira and Vernon Gonsalves — have been arrested for their alleged links with the CPI (Maoist).

On January 24, the Union home ministry had passed an order transferring further investigation into the case from the Pune police to the NIA after the newly formed Maha Vikas Aghadi government in the state initiated a review of the investigation done so far by the police. The review was started after NCP chief Sharad Pawar had demanded setting up of an SIT to inquire into the police action in the case.

Anganwadi

Dehradun: Days after holding captive a team of medical personnel who had come to check on them, protesting anganwadi workers laid siege to the office of the women and child welfare department (WCD) on Thursday.

Irked over the director’s move to send notice to the protesting anganwadi personnel to resume work or else face suspension, the protesting workers locked the main gate and met the director of WCD, Jharna Kamthan.

Speaking to TOI on the issue, Kamthan said, “The notice was issued by the respective districts and not from the directorate. Also, we are ready to listen to their demands provided they resume work first. In some places like Chamoli and Pithoragarh, the anganwadi workers have resumed work. The rest should also do it.”

The protesters, however, expressed scepticism over the official’s assurances and asserted that they will continue with the protest until the officials heed to their demands.

“Why should we bow down to their demands when our basic rights are being trampled upon? The director told us that they are following the orders from political leaders, which means we are being fooled by the politicians. Year-on-year, each government keeps on giving us assurances, but no one fulfills them,” said Rekha Negi, president, Anganwari Karmachari Union of Uttarakhand.

Meanwhile, two of the protesters were lifted from Parade Ground in the evening on Thursday and forcibly taken to a hospital by the police. At the same time, two other anganwadi workers from Kalsi area of Chakrata sat on an indefinite hunger strike. Till date, 14 anganwadi workers have been lifted from the protest site.

The anganwadi works are on a strike from the past one-and-a-half month which has impeded several programmes run by health, education and statistics department.

The agitators have been fighting for Rs 600 daily wage and regular employee status.

HYDERABAD: Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad has decided to appoint an additional psychological counsellor and coordinators in hostels for students going through a stressful time and for those seeking help from fellow students or management in the campus.

The decision to prioritize mental health comes after the institute witnessed three suicides by students in the last year.

Unveiling the ‘IIT Hyderabad’s Vision for 2024’, Prof BS Murthy, the new Director of IIT Hyderabad said, “Major emphasis is being placed in reducing stress levels of students. We are going to add an additional psychological counsellor on the campus and appoint a pod coordinator for each floor of the hostel where one student will be made in charge and provided financial support to organize regular meetings to just gather students of their hostel floor and have a small get together and open up by just talking to each other.”

Murthy informed that IIT Hyderabad is also taking measures to have faculty and alumni mentor students, conduct ‘stress relieving’ sessions by psychologists and motivational speakers and introduce shared accommodation for first year UG students.

Dr C Krishna Mohan, professor of computer science and engineering and dean of public and corporate relations said, “We are appointing one male psychological counsellor on the campus apart from the two female counsellors that we already have. We also have class advisors and one teacher for every three students to discuss their concerns. We are taking all possible measures to reduce suicides.” The institute has set a target of generating Rs 200 crore per year for funding research by 2024. The current level of research funding stands at Rs 50 crore a year.

380,['31/01/2020'],Yale prof warns over handling of coronavirus cases,"This story is from January 31, 2020

Bhopal: Yale professor Joseph Vinetz, ly an expert on how infectious disease spread, has raised an alarm about the way suspected Coronavirus patients are being handled in India.

A visiting faculty at PGI Chandigarh, Prof Vinetz said: “WHO, CDC scientists are extremely concerned about suspected Coronavirus patients being discharged without molecular tests in densely populated countries like India. Neither molecular tests nor the complete WHO and CDS protocols of testing are being followed. The patients could be a great danger to the community at large.”

The internationally renowned expert explained: “The new Coronavirus seems to have become stable in humans and the spread of cases reflects this new adaptation to humans.”

At this point, it’s fair to say that this (mutation) probably happened at the time that this virus jumped from whichever animal sources to humans.

“The best strategy is to wash hands well and to stay away from crowded places for a few weeks,” said Prof Vinetz.

Experts indicate at the possibility of mutation of coronavirus in a student at Ujjain, where the suspected patient’s mother was also treated for viral influenza. The MP health department is also directed for surveillance of suspected Coronavirus family members for any mutation. Novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. “We usually do not diagnose most of the viruses. India needs easily available diagnostics facilities,” said Prof Vinetz.

The only way to diagnose Coronavirus is extensive molecular-based testing. Blood test will not be helpful. Molecular test on serum sample or swab from back of the nose is tested in reference laboratory, he said. Molecular tests are generally are not available (in India), except in highly specialized reference laboratories, he added.

381,['31/01/2020'],Govt clears spl pay for SPU as other units still wait,"This story is from January 31, 2020

Nagpur: The state home department on Thursday issued a government resolution (GR) sanctioning risk allowance to Special Protection Unit (SPU), which functions under the State Intelligence Department (SID), following the revised pay scheme under the seventh pay commission.

While SPU has been granted the special pay package, the wait continues for the other risk-prone units like Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad (BDDS), State Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS), State Anti-Naxal Operation squad (ANO) and the likes who too enjoyed extra pay earlier. TOI has already highlighted the plight of the units like BDDS, ATS and ANO as they have been deprived of the special pay allowance post-seventh pay commission.

In 1986, state government had issued a GR allowing special pay of 50% for officers and 30% for drivers on the pay scale for SPU. The special package remained unchanged till sixth pay commission revision.

In the latest hike, SPU will have to remain content with only 25% increase in the pay packages of the officers and 15% for drivers on their basic salaries.

It is learnt state police have written to the government seeking guidance on giving risk allowance of special units. These units had been getting 50% risk allowance until the seventh pay commission was implemented by the Maharashtra government from January 2019. It is learnt ATS did not even get arrears of around four months after their salaries were revised as per seventh pay commission in May last year.

Senior NCP leader Nutan Rewatkar, meeting the home minister Anil Deshmukh, presented a memorandum demanding that the risk allowance is sanctioned immediately for BDDS, ATS and ANO citing additional threat on their lives in routine work. She has also demanded other welfare measures, including eight hour work shift, for all police personnel.

Panaji: The directorate of the health services (DHS) has proposed to facilitate online renewal of Deen Dayal Swasthya Seva Yojna (DDSSY) cards. Currently, citizens need to visit a local registration office for both, registration as well as to renew cards.

While registration under the cashless insurance scheme can be done at any time of the year, a DDSSY card needs to be ideally renewed two months prior its lapse in September.

“So, people need to renew their DDSSY cards either in July or August,” a DHS official said.

The officer is optimistic that during the next renewal of cards which is due in July/August, people will able to renew their cards online and not required to visit a registration office. For new registrations, people will need to visit the office, he said.

A new registration of card, the official said, can be done at any time of the year as against the earlier procedure followed, when potential beneficiaries could register themselves to avail of the scheme, only during the period specified by DHS.

The registration was not open throughout.

As of now, 2.2 lakh cards have been issued. “Anyone who has resided in Goa for five years is eligible to receive benefits under DDSSY,” he said.

He said since the appointment of the new third party-administrator (TPA), the government has been able to reduce its payouts towards insurance premiums.

A few months ago, M D India Healthcare Services (TPA) Pvt Ltd was appointed TPA, while earlier another TPA was engaged.

“The government has been able to save Rs 25-30 crore annually,” he said.

Bicholim: A total of 199 villagers from Mayem village in Bicholim taluka were distributed sanads of their houses on Thursday at the hands of speaker of Goa assembly Rajesh Patnekar and Mayem MLA Pravin Zantye.

Mayem villagers have been fighting for ownership of their houses situated in custodian of evacuee property for the last several years. Villagers had to seek permission from the landlord for any work they wanted to carry out. They were, therefore, demanding ownership right. Then-chief minister Manohar Parrikar passed a special law granting them right of ownership. After the enactment of this law, 88 villagers were distributed sanads. However, after Parrikar’s death, this process slowed down. Finally, on Thursday 199 villagers received their sanads.

Patnekar, who was the chief guest for the function, said the efforts made by Parrikar to free villagers from the slavery of Portuguese have turned fruitful. He said that 1,500 villagers will be distributed Sanads in future.

Zantye said that the BJP government will follow up on this issue so that people get ownership of their houses as early as possible.

President of Mayem Bhuvimochan Nagarik Kruti Samiti Kashinath Mayekar has demanded that the government distribute Class-I sanads and not Class-II. Sakharam Pednekar has asked the government to undertake the process of sanads through the Bicholim mamlatdar office instead of the collector’s office at Panaji.

Garbage dump at Yaadgar-e-Shahjehani Park is one of the nine such locations where the BMC plans to open diesel... Read More

Bhopal: In an alarming development, Bhopal Municipal Corporation has initiated the process of opening several new diesel stations on land where city’s garbage is dumped. Nine such locations have been identified; interestingly small or major fires have been reported in all these garbage dumps. Logic of opening these ‘combustible petrol pumps’ on these vulnerable locations, has literally left top state government officials fuming.

By its own admission, BMC has invited proposals without attaining expert opinion from union government’s safety watchdog, Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO). BMC additional commissioner, Kamal Solanki, said, “We have written to PESO seeking their point of view. Nine companies have contacted us for setting up of diesel stations and diesel bowsers (a tank mounted on the chassis of a vehicle with a dispensing unit).”

Locations include Arif Nagar, Yaadgar-e-Shahjehani Park, Bairagarh, Arif Nagar, Dana Pani, Yatayat Nagar and others. Garbage burning along these dump stations is a common phenomenon. Only recently, the Adampur Chhawani dump reported a major fire that went on for days.

BMC officials claim that having more diesel dispensing stations would add to 10% saving on fuel. However, eyebrows have been raised over the rush in inviting tenders for the proposals, barely two weeks ahead of end of the term of BMC council. BMC committee looking into the diesel scam of 2016, has not yet submitted its findings to the state government.

The civic body already has a diesel dispensing station near MANIT and around 600 vehicles get fuel from the station each day. BMC station requires about one tank of 22,000 litre diesel each day, which amounts to a fuel bill of about Rs 4 crore per month.

Additional commissioner, defends the decision, saying, “The fuel station shall be located at a safe distance as prescribed by the fire department or other authorities as per The Petroleum Rules, 1976. Besides, a safety certification of the location has to be furnished. Around nine companies have initiated talks with BMC. On Thursday, some PSUs claimed they are exempt from serving performance guarantee and earnest money deposit. The matter has been referred to the finance department.”

This year, the theme is the ‘seven sacraments of Christianity’. Masses on the first and last days will be general, and on other days, they will be based on Baptism, Eucharist, Confirmation, Reconciliation, Anointing of the sick, Marriage and Holy Orders.

Lucknow: The body of a home guard assigned duty at the residence of an IAS officer was found on the ground floor of CSI Towers in Gomtinagar on Thursday.

The 47-year-old guard, Dhirendra Kumar Mishra, worked in the eighth floor apartment of a senior IAS officer.

An empty bottle of liquor was found close to the apartment while three cigarette butts and a blood spot were found on the stairs. Inside Mishra’s room, a packet suspected to contain cannabis was found. A forensic team is inspecting the crime scene and all items.

According to police, a private security guard spotted the body in a corner near the fire exit around 8am. He rushed to his supervisor who identified the man and informed police.

They also contacted Mishra’s wife Neelu (41), who lives in Indiranagar.

Gomtinagar SHO Amit Kumar Dubey said, “The IAS officer met Dhirendra around 11.30pm and went to his room as usual. We are scanning CCTV footage in the building for clues. A postmortem examination report is awaited.”

Mishra used to stay in the apartment of the IAS officer. On weekends, when the officer would go to Noida to meet his family, Mishra would leave for his house in Indiranagar. He had last visited his house on Tuesday for a function.

Neelu, a contractual employee in UPPCL, said that Mishra had been working for the IAS officer since 2002. She claimed that the officer was very generous to Mishra and had helped their son get a job and their two daughters get an education. This, however, made the officer’s three other servants jealous.

“They wanted my husband replaced and might have killed him,” said Neelu.

She added that Mishra was a lively person and would never commit suicide.

“We talked around 7.30pm on Wednesday and there was nothing unusual about him,” she said.

Mishra’s skull and both legs were broken. He had injuries on his chest and abdomen, too.

Nagpur: Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe on Thursday directed NMC’s property tax department to auction government properties to recover tax dues. He issued the directives after a review meeting of the property tax department.

Currently, the central government has 314 properties and has pending property tax dues to the tune of Rs37.86 crore. Similarly, various state government offices own 146 properties and have not paid Rs19.51 crore in NMC property tax, tax department officials informed Mundhe in a power point presentation on Thursday.

The tax department also informed the civic chief about Rs290.83 crore property tax arrears from 2,57,237 property owners and Rs99.07 crore from owners of 72,309 open plots. The civic chief expressed concern over poor property tax recovery.

He also asked about measures being adopted by the tax department to recover dues from defaulting property owners, said sources. The department informed the civic chief about its initiative of auctioning private properties to recover tax dues. So far, NMC has auctioned 150 properties of which 12 sale deeds have been executed, while due to lack of response from bidders, NMC changed the ownership rights of 138 properties.

Besides this, it has also issued warrant notices to 9,745 property owners and also executed seizure notices to 2,595 property owners. Besides this, the department has also started the process to auction another 495 properties of tax defaulters.

To this, Mundhe directed the tax department to concentrate on improving property tax collection from both private and government properties owners. The municipal commissioner said the department should start initiating auction of properties of government offices too. Henceforth, the department will first issue warrant notices, followed by seizure notices, and then auction the properties of government departments if they fail to clear their outstanding property tax dues.

Bhopal: JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh on Thursday joined the anti-CAA Satyagraha at Bhopal’s Iqbal Maidan and condemned the shooting of a protesting Jamia student in Delhi.

“Union minister Anurag Thakur had recently said ‘Desh ke gaddaro ko goli, maro ***** ko’, and his man did it today in Jamia,” she said. “I condemn this attack. This has only strengthened the motivation of students and JNU will not bow in any situation. There will be no change in our fight against wrong policies despite attacks by RSS,” said Ghosh.

Narmada Bachao Andolan activist Medha Patkar, Madhya Pradesh minority affairs minister Arif Aqueel, Congress MLA Arif Masood, Archbishop Leo Cornelio and some Jamia students were among the protesters at Iqban Maidan on Thursday.

“This movement should not stop till the objective is achieved. We have been fighting for justice (for Sardar Sarovar Dam evictees) for years, which has forced the government to listen to us. Likewise, the protest against CAA and NRC should continue,” said Patkar.

Ghosh alleged that Delhi Police hasn’t done anything about the violence on students at JNU. “I was attacked yet police made me the accused. This will not stop me from fighting against wrongs,” said Ghosh, alleging that there is a conspiracy to “lock down JNU”. “People will keep asking about employment, education and other basic needs even if they lock down JNU. We will keep fighting,” said Ghosh.

She demanded to know the logic behind CAA and NRC, and why the BJP-led Centre wanted Indians to prove citizenship. “We got citizenship 70 years ago. No one can ask about our integrity and citizenship,” she said.

Asked if she would contest the 2024 election, she said, “I have to complete my PhD first. Later, I will decide what I’ll do in the future.”

PANAJI: The state forest department is going to set up a turtle conservation centre at Morjim where a turtle nesting site is already prevalent. It will feature a display of environmental films, marine life artefacts and photographs of the turtle nesting site.

The centre is conceptualised to be along the same lines as the nature interpretation centre at the Dr Salim Ali bird sanctuary at Chorao.

“We have to do some groundwork before setting up the nature interpretation centre. By the end of the year, we will be able to set it up,” said principal chief conservator of forests, Subhash Chandra.

Since consuming turtles is no longer in vogue and they have instead become pets, the centre at Morjim is also going to serve as a medium to raise further awareness about the flippered friends that people have at their homes.

With the site expected to come up at the Morjim beach, the forest department is ensuring that the centre is built without violating any CRZ norms.

“It’s a coastal zone area, so we cannot build a concrete structure, there. The centre will be built away from the inter-tidal zone. We will take appropriate permissions from the coastal zonal authority,” said additional principal chief conservator of forests and chief wildlife warden, Santosh Kumar.

Kumar said that the structure will be eco-friendly, and the forest department will begin with the works in a few months.

“It will be a wooden cottage housing a display of photographs, films being screened at regular intervals and history of turtle nesting and turtle conservation in Goa,” he said.

“We have received government approval for the same. We will soon float a tender and carry out other formalities before the monsoon.” he added.

The Morjim beach, which lies on the bank of the Chapora river, is where Goa’s modest turtle conservation effort begun in the late 1990s. During the 2018-19 season, 22 nests had been laid at Morjim and Mandrem and 1,500-odd hatchlings had been released from about 2,500 eggs.

This season’s first Olive Ridley turtle nest on Morjim beach was laid earlier this month.

Kasganj youth Chandan Gupta was shot dead during a Tiranga Yatra he was leading through a communally sensitive area in the western Uttar Pradesh town on January 26, 2018.

However, Chandan’s father Sushil Gupta told TOI that he strongly condemned this act of violence. “I condemn the act of opening fire at Jamia protesters in the strongest possible words. We are a non-violent society and protest should always be peaceful. I have lost my son to one such act of violence ,” Gupta said.

“I support the Citizenship Amendment Act, but violence is not the answer for those who are against the law. In fact, this violent act hampers the government efforts on CAA. His act is not justified on any parameter,” Chandan’s father said.

According to police, Chandan was killed in violence that began after a group obstructed another group taking out Tiranga Yatra to mark Republic Day, at Abdul Hameed Chowk in Kasganj city in 2018.

Phanideep Karnati

HYDERABAD: US-based Telugu software professional Phanideep Karnati was given six-month jail term for recruiting students to fake Farmington University , set up by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), by a US court in Detroit on Wednesday. After the verdict, ICE sleuths immediately took him into custody.

Phanideep, who had studied engineering in Hyderabad before moving to the US 11 yeas ago to take up a job there, maintained that he was not aware that it was a fake university and went by the university’s website that it was genuine. He also said he believed that the university would conduct online classes.

Phanideep was arrested along with eight others last year for recruiting students to the fake university. The university was set up by the ICE to check visa frauds. While seven others were handed out sentences in January 2019, Phanideep was sentenced on Wednesday. Last year, after his arrest, he had obtained bail.

Journalist Niraj Warikoo, in his report in ‘Detroit Free Press’, mentioned what district court Judge Gershwin Drain told Phanideep. The judge said: “I'm convinced you were guilty. It's serious, but it's not all that serious. You have a very clean record, you got a family. I view you as a little less culpable.” The other seven, who were convicted last year of the crime, were given sentences up to two years.

Phanideep would have to serve the six-month jail term after which he will be deported to India by the authorities. As many as 39 students were reportedly recruited by the eight Indians to the fake university. According to reports, over 600 students had enrolled in the fake university from India and other countries. The ICE set up the university as an undercover operation to bust a fake visa fraud.

In a statement, head of ICE's investigative division, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), for Michigan and Ohio, Vance Callender, said the sentencing of the final criminal defendant in HSI’s University of Farmington investigation made it unequivocally clear that every individual who participated in this scheme knew it was an illegal pay-to-stay scam.

According to journalist Niraj Warikoo, Phanideep pleaded for mercy. “I trusted the University of Farmington was genuine. I relied on the website and the listing by government agencies that it was legitimate. I apologize to the US government. I should have done more research to find out if the university was legitimate. I ruined my beautiful life and career. ... I beg your mercy,” he said pleading with the judge.

Urban development minister Eknath Shinde announced on Thursday that residents of 2,086 hutments right in the path of the elevated route will now be relocated in MMRDA rental housing schemes in the district.

“I have directed MMRDA to explore if the residents can be given permanent housing in their scheme. This will pave the way for easy execution of the project,” said Shinde.

It may be recalled that rehabilitation of the residents reportedly delayed the project for a few years, said an official from MRVC, which is executing the project. “We had to clear the space under the piers before we could proceed with the works. The project could now proceed,” said an official.

UDAIPUR: Senior Congress leaders denounced lathicharge of protesters during a rally taken out on Wednesday in Udaipur against CAA-NRC.

A delegation of the party leaders met additional SP, city Gopal Swaroop Mewara on Thursday and expressed their resentment over the way the police handled the situation.

Leaders, including former legislator Trilok Purbia, chairperson of the congress committee, Udaipur city Gopal Krishna Sharma, general secretary Pankaj Sharma claimed the anti-social elements and communal forces had pressurized the police to take such an action and lathicharged innocent public.

“The lathicharge was done at two places. One at Delhi Gate and other outside collectorate. Innocent youths were mercilessly beaten up and dragged into false cases lodged at different police stations. Residents are shocked after knowing what had happened. It is truly undemocratic and unruly which deserves severe condemnation,” Sharma said.

The party men said the protesters had well in advance sought permission for the rally and they were following the route granted to them. Some shopkeepers who were CAA supporters instigated them by indulging in verbal spat at many places when the protestors politely asked them to shut down their units. The leaders also claimed that for past two days anti-social elements had been planning through the social media and looking for a chance to breach the peace in the area and they were backed by the police through this lathicharge action. They demanded cases to be withdrawn against protesters as well as ensure peace and order restored in the area.

BHOPAL: Barkatullah University (BU) issued show-cause notices to 40 colleges on Wednesday for not furnishing the requisite information on the All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) portal.

The university warned that affiliation of colleges will be cancelled, if they failed to do so in 10 days.

“This is not done. Colleges have to provide information on the AISHE portal . Else, they will lose affiliation,” Bharti said categorically. BU has 480 affiliated colleges in six districts, including Bhopal .

Department of higher education runs the AISHE portal. Union ministry of human resource development (MHRD) had initiated AISHE in 2010-11 to build a robust database and assess the correct picture of higher education in the country.

Sources said that several colleges are not uploading information on the AISHE portal because they lack the requisite infrastructure facilities.

“On giving information, their fake claims could be exposed,” said a senior official of the university asking for anonymity.

Colleges affiliated to BU conduct courses for which a large number of students enrol. However, some colleges do not have enough faculty, required as per criterion.

“In some colleges professors have left jobs long back. But on paper they remain as faculty,” added the official

Bharti has made it clear that such colleges will have to face action.

“As of now, I do not have any information about irregularities in colleges. After I get their detailed information, I will take action as per the rules,” said Bharti.

A police team handed over the custody of George Osaremen Eguare (46) and Tayo Adejumo (42) to the immigration officials at the Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, following which the duo boarded a flight to Kigali. From there, they will fly to Lagos in Nigeria , an official of the foreigners registration office (FRO) said.

“An inquiry has revealed that the Nigerians had come to India on a business visa and were staying in New Delhi before shifting to Pune. Their visa had expired two years ago, but they continued to stay in the country,” the official said.

The FRO had later issued an order restricting them from leaving the city and lodged them at the Kondhwa police station. They were deported to Nigeria after the completion of the legal formalities.

NEW DELHI: The ‘ Long March ’ from Jamia Millia Islamia to Rajghat, meant to commemorate the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on Thursday, came to a halt when a youth shot at the marchers with a country-made pistol, injuring one on the hand. The students , joined by local residents, then demonstrated at the police barricades near Holy Family Hospital.

Protesters rallied by the Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC) assembled at Jamia’s Gate number 7 before the start of the planned march at noon. However, with exams affecting the participation of students, the organisers went to Zakir Nagar and Batla House to mobilise people. It was, therefore, only after 1.30pm that the march began. As the procession reached the intersection of Okhla Road and MP Road, a man brandishing a gun emerged from the crowd and shot at the marchers, injuring Shadab Farooq on his left arm.

Undeterred, the protesters continued their march but were confronted with strong police barricading near Holy Family Hospital. For the next few hours, the Jamia students angrily remonstrated there alongside residents of Zakir Nagar, Batla House and other neighbourhoods. “We came here as soon as we heard about a student being shot,” said Batla House resident Tawqeer. “We demand action against the cops who stood like statues while all this was happening.”

Zoya Tasleem, a master’s student, raged, “Police attack students with teargas and lathis, but do nothing to stop gunmen on the street.” Many blamed Union minister of state for finance Anurag Thakur and BJP’s Model Town candidate Kapil Mishra for “inciting people”. Asif Ali, a law student at DU, held a placard that said: “Anurag Thakur, badhai ho tumhare gunde goli chala rahe hain (Congrats, your goons are firing at people).” Ali declared, “I think what happened today was because of the minister’s provocative statement that protesters should be shot down.”

Among the protesters was Harjeet Singh, who had been attacked at Union home minister’s Amit Shah rally in Babarpur on Sunday. The 20-year-old DU student twirled his moustache and declared, “I am against the Citizenship Amendment Act. Why should we be worried about people who chose not to live in India? We must care for our people.” He claimed he was “fighting for Bharat Mata” and was a follower of Bhagat Singh.

Around 3pm, Qari Mohammad Suleman Qasmi, imam of Jamia’s Jama Masjid, requested the protesters at the barricade to disperse. “Standing here is not correct. We will continue the protest peacefully. I am ready to give the last drop of my blood to the student,” Qasmi told the unrelenting protesters.

As it got dark, Jamia students and university officials formed human chains and used a loud-speaker to ask the protesters to leave because the situation could get dangerous and the crowd finally thinned after 7.30pm.

Lucknow: A soil conditioner that will help boost plant growth will be the first of its kind to be launched by Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants ( CIMAP ) during the Kisan Mela to be held on Friday.

Two other research-based products—a cream and a hair oil—will be launched at the event.

“At present, there is no soil conditioner in India that helps in plant growth, making it healthier and more productive. The product, CIM-Mridashakti, is made up of decomposing crop residue. It makes soil nutrient-rich and retains water, which boosts plant growth,” said principal scientist Pooja Khare.

The scientific institute has also created a herbal solution for treating skin problems like psoriasis and inflammatory skin conditions with the help of a non-steroidal skin-friendly cream. The cream has been developed after a research of 10 years.

“Creams used for the treatment of psoriasis or other skin problems lead to thinning of skin, exposing it to more harmful UV rays. The PsoriaCIM cream is chemical-free, aromatic plant-based and gives the best results within two weeks,” said principal scientist NP Yadav, who led the research.

After a four-year research, the scientific institute has come up with CIMKESH—a herb-based hair oil with zero chemicals, that will help fight dandruff and other hair-related issues.

412,['31/01/2020'],Odisha tops national list of police stations with no vehicles,"This story is from January 31, 2020

Bhubaneswar: Police’s mobility is directly linked with their operational performance. Odisha, however, seems to lag behind other states in not having enough vehicles in its police stations.

The Bureau of Police Research and Developments (BPRD)’s latest data on police organisations said Odisha had the highest number of police stations without vehicles in the country as on January 1, 2019. Of the 620 police stations in the state, 37 had no vehicles. Assam came second, with 15 of its 343 police stations having no vehicles.

Though the BPRD report did not name the 37 police stations that lack vehicles, sources said they were located in remote rural areas. The report said Odisha Police had 6,030 vehicles; of them, 1,823 had been given to 583 police stations.

The state police headquarters said called the data dated and said the mobility of police had improved substantially over the years. “The BPRD report is dated. It may be over one or two years old. I think all our police stations have vehicles now. Some might be under repair or temporarily off the roads,” DGP Abhay said, adding that new vehicles were being purchased for successful implementation of the state government’s ambitious 5T and Mo Sarkar initiatives.

The BPRD data also said while all police stations had telephone/wireless/mobile phone services, not all had enough CCTV cameras. Police in several states had more than 1,000 such cameras but Odisha Police had only 865 till January 1, 2019.

The data has also brought to the fore the poor allocation of funds to police in Odisha’s annual budget. Out of the Rs 1,06,911-crore state budget in 2017-18, only Rs 3,286.49 crore or 3.07% was earmarked for police. The percentage dropped in 2018-19; of the Rs 1,20,028-crore budget for that fiscal, the government allocated only Rs 3,559.51 crore (2.96%) to police.

413,['31/01/2020'],Thousands form human chain to oppose CAA,"This story is from January 31, 2020

Chennai: In a massive and peaceful show of solidarity, thousands of people including students from a few city colleges joined a human chain protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) and National Population Register ( NPR ) on January 30 (Thursday), Mahatma Gandhi’s death anniversary.

The human chain, organised by several groups under Tamil Makkal Otrumai Medai, stretched from Tiruvottiyur to Tambaram.

The protest that lasted about an hour slowed down traffic at Thousand Lights, Gemini flyover, DMS, Nandanam, Saidapet and Pallavaram. Women and children took part in large numbers, raising slogans against CAA , NRC, bearing the tricolour. Police said about 3,300 people stood from Periyar Statue in Teynampet to Gemini flyover.

The protesters were joined by various political leaders at different points along the 30-km stretch on Anna Salai and GST Road. They slammed the Centre for forcing CAA, NRC and NPR on the citizens and called it out for discriminating against one particular religion.

Dubbing it a murder of the Constitution the protesters said the CAA and NRC were aimed at dividing people along the lines of religion. “We are here to condemn passage of the Bill that became an Act, as a piece of legislation that was forced upon the country without debate and consensus,” said Mumtaz, a protester from Nungambakkam.

They called out to people travelling by MTC buses to join them in the protest and distributed pamphlets about the controversial Act.

Manithaneya Makkal Katchi founder M H Jawahirullah, who participated in the protest, said it was organised on the day of Gandhi’s martydom as the CAA, NPR and NRC are diametrically opposite to his ideals. “Gandhiji wanted an inclusive India. The CAA, NRC and NPR are divisive and discriminate people on the basis of religion. NPR has the potential of snatching citizenship of the poor and downtrodden people. Moreover, it exposes the private information of individuals.”

Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) president K S Alagiri, VCK chief Thol Thirumavalavan, CPM state secretary K Balakrishnan, VCK deputy general secretary Vanni Arasu, MPs Nawaz Gani and Su Venkatesan, and many district secretaries of the DMK joined the human chain at various positions starting from Wallajah Road-Anna Salai junction to Tambaram bus terminus.

PUNE: The Metro rail project is set to receive a crucial funds injection on Friday, when the European Investment Bank (EIB) signs a loan agreement in Mumbai.EIB officials visited the sites of Metro and depot work on Thursday. The EIB is expected to extend a total loan of 600 million euros, or Rs4,705 crore, for the Rs11,420-crore project. Friday’s agreement will see 200 million euros — Rs1,568 crore — being disbursed.Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited ( MahaMetro ) officials said that the loan will help speed up the execution of the project by ensuring a consistent flow of funds. “The money will be utilized primarily for the underground tunnelling work, the construction of the Metro viaduct from Civil Court to Ramwadi (Reach 3) and two depots coming up at Vanaz and College of Agriculture,” an official said.“The EIB team sought details on relief and rehabilitation for the project-displaced and about compensation against land acquisition.

415,['31/01/2020'],Delhi flight delayed by 2 hours as low visibility diverts plane carrying pilots,"This story is from January 31, 2020

Kolkata: Freak weather on Thursday morning led to the diversion of a flight , the domino effect of which delayed another flight’s departure for nearly two hours.

All 125 passengers booked on IndiGo flight 6E 854 to Delhi boarded the aircraft by 8.25am, well in time for the 8.40am departure, when the head stewardess announced the delay. The reason: the pilots scheduled to operate the flight had not arrived yet.

The announcement left passengers flummoxed. Jadavpur University faculty of engineering and technology dean Sadhan Ghosh, who was travelling to Delhi to join TERI World Summit on Sustainable Development, was shocked. “How can the pilots not be there when all the passengers are seated in the plane? This is extremely unprofessional,” he said, apprehensive of missing a crucial meeting slated for 1pm and a lecture 2.30pm.

Little did Ghosh and other passengers know that the cockpit crew of the flight were seated in the cockpit of another plane mid-air. The crew was piloting a flight from Bengaluru to Kolkata and were to switch to the cockpit of flight 6E 854 to Delhi after landing, but bad weather over the city forced a change in plans. With visibility less than 500m due to fog-like condition, the flight was diverted to Bhubaneswar. “Between 8am and 9am, visibility dropped drastically. This forced the diversion of the fight,” an official at the Kolkata air traffic control said.

According to the meteorological department at the airport, visibility was 1,500m at 6am but decreased gradually to 700m at 7.30am. Half-an-hour later, it dipped to 500m and stayed at the level till 9am. Thereafter, it gradually improved again.

An IndiGo official said the drop in visibility forced the diversion of the flight from Bengaluru. “Even as the flight from Bengaluru was diverted, passengers had already begun boarding the Delhi-bound flight. The pilots had to fly to Bhubaneswar, refuel and then return. This caused the delay. As asking the passengers to disembark would have complicated matters as fresh boarding cards would have had to be issued and flyers would have had to undergo security check again, they were asked to wait in the aircraft and served refreshments,” the official said.

The flight finally took off at 10.46am, two hours behind schedule and reached Delhi at 1.19pm. Ghosh, who missed out on his engagements in Delhi, wrote a complaint to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, questioning why the delay was not communicated in advance and why passengers, including kids, were made to wait in the plane for over two hours.

Is the state prepared to deal with possible cases of coronavirus?

What about bird flu?

The state health scheme

Yojana (BSKY) was supposed to be merged with the

, the Odisha State Treatment Fund and the

. But hospitals empanelled for one scheme are not entertaining the others. Why?

Any plan to merge BSKY with the Centre’s Ayushman Bharat?

The Orissa High Court had in August 2010 asked the government to start kidney transplant in three government-run medical colleges in Cuttack, Burla and Berhampur. But it’s been started in Cuttack only. What about the other two?

Why has Odisha not been able to start cadaver organ transplants?

Has your role as health minister become less significant after the health department came under 5T?

Amid bird flu and coronavirus scare, health minister Naba Kishore Das tells Ashok Pradhan about the state’s ‘proactive preparedness’ for possible public health challenges besides sharing his long-term vision for better healthcare services in the state.Chief minister Naveen Patnaik has a particularly proactive approach to natural calamities and public health challenges. Though there is no suspected case of nCoV (novel corona virus) in the state so far, we are not taking any chances. Those with a travel history to China are being kept in the ‘watch list’ and their health condition is being monitored. Two such persons have been kept in ‘home isolation’ as a precautionary measure though they don’t have any clinical symptoms. Soon test kits will be available so that blood samples can be collected by the Regional Medical Research Centre and sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune for testing. Hospitals strategic to airports and seaports have been empowered with the required facilities to deal with any exigency.We are keeping a close watch on the possible spread of the H5N1 virus. There has been no case of a human being contracting the virus so far. According to protocol, the veterinary officials have been culling birds in some areas of Bhubaneswar where some samples had tested positive to the virus. They are collecting samples from elsewhere at random. Since H5N1 cases were reported in the state in the past few years, there is substantial community awareness. We are further building on that. There is no reason to panic.That’s not entirely true. There may be cases where hospitals have confusions regarding the merger. Beneficiaries of any one of these health schemes are automatically covered under BSKY. We will soon hold a meeting of hospital administrators to remove the misconceptions, if any.The state is open to it. I had said this earlier as well. However, we have requested the Centre to make a few changes. We want the central scheme to cover all the 70 lakh families, who are the existing beneficiaries of BSKY. The Centre’s scheme proposes to cover around 61 lakh families. This would lead to more than eight lakh families being left out of the health cover. Similarly, we have asked for free treatment, without the need for any health card in government hospitals, as the maximum patient load is on government facilities. If the Centre considers these requests, the state won’t have any problem with the merger.Starting organ transplants and offering super-speciality care for heart diseases and cancer is under the active consideration of the government, both for the VSS Institute of Medical Sciences and Research at Burla and the MKCG Medical College and Hospital in Berhampur. Super-specialty healthcare targets can’t be achieved in a small period of time. Shortage of doctors, particularly specialists and super-specialists, is a major issue. One must appreciate that the government has opened four medical colleges (Koraput, Baripada, Balangir and Balasore) in the past four years. The state had only three earlier, the last of which (Berhampur) was opened in the 1960s. Seven more medical colleges are in different stages of completion. After five more years, we will produce surplus manpower in MBBS and in various specialities. They will help offer all high-end services.The required infrastructure and protocol are in place. As and when we have a brain-dead person, and the kin are willing, the organs can be harvested and transplanted. But there can’t be a deadline for such a thing. This happens in an unforeseen situation.Not at all! This misconception seems to have been spread by my political rivals. 5T and Mo Sarkar bring any department under better supervision of the CM and additional number of senior officers. This is adding to our efforts to provide better services to our people. At the same time, ministers and officers of the department concerned are also actively involved in its workings. As health minister, for instance, I have to clear the files pertaining to health. 5T is only bringing governance in mission mode.",bhubaneswar,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73800471,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-229849,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/cm-has-a-proactive-approach-to-public-health-challenges/articleshow/73779268.cms

Wonder Cement officials at a presser in Bhopal on Thursday

Bhopal: With an investment of Rs350 crore, a new cement plant became operational in Madhya Pradesh from Thursday. Set up in Dhar district in western MP, the plant will generate 200 jobs directly. It took almost a year to make the plant operational.

Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, the director of Wonder Cement, Vivek Patni, said the company plans to achieve a combined production capacity of 13MT per annum in 2020, along with its unit at Jhajjar in Haryana. The new production units of the company came with an investment of Rs800 crore in Badnawar in Dhar district and Jhajjar, he said. The investment in the Dhar factory is around Rs350 crore.

Wonder Cement executives said that the company was earlier operating from Rajasthan and has about 14% market share in western MP.

When asked why the plant was set up in Badnawar, Patni said that the town of Dhar is the gateway of MP and the clinker (raw material for cement) for the grinding unit will be transported from Nimbahera in Rajasthan. “Now, we will be able to supply our cement in rest of MP”, he said. Nimbahera is around 250 kilometres away from Dhar.

“The new production unit also has a geographical advantage due to its proximity to the company headquarters in Rajasthan”, Patni said.

To a pointed query, Sanjay Joshi, the executive director of Wonder Cement said that though there is a slowdown in the market, the cement industry is not affected.

Managing director JC Toshniwal said, “200 people will get direct employment, while about 1,000 will get indirect employment from the new facility.”

Toshniwal said that the company will adhere to MP government’s condition of providing 70% jobs to the local people. “The 200 jobs will fall under that category,” he said.

The protests at Samvidhan Square have not wavered in intensity

Nagpur: Even as organizers appealed for door-to-door and street-corner awareness campaigns at non-Muslim homes across the city on the perils of CAA-NRC , they announced the Nagpur Shaheenbagh protest from February 3 at Teka Naka’s Farooq Nagar ground.

The announcements came during the last day of anti-CAA-NRC dharna organized by Jamiat Ulema Hind at Samvidhan Square on Thursday. A crowd of around 1,000 protesters, which had an equal number of men and women, had gathered at the venue.

Salman Ahmed, one of the coordinators for all protests taking place in city, said the dharna is ending but ‘Ethezaz’ (dissent) will continue. “Now we have to go door-to-door or hold street-corner meets to reach out to our non-Muslim brothers and sisters and tell them how CAA, NRC and NPR are not just anti-Muslims but anti-India. It is against all Indians,” he said.

Asked how the proposed campaign on the lines of Sangh Parivar’s nationwide support meet will be carried out, Ahmed said it will have to be done carefully ensuring peace is maintained.

“It has to be done with specific define and design and not just anywhere. We will have to ensure we have trustworthy friends in company. The campaign will be coordinated by non-Muslims brothers and sisters who love the concept of Indian Constitution which to promotes communal harmony and fraternity to establish peace in society,” said Ahmed.

The organizers are looking forward to collective activity with support from different organizations.

In his speech, Ahmed said the government was targeting a $5 trillion economy but was unable to contain hatred and cold war. “All our infrastructure and investments are of no use if this ongoing cold war is not contained. They are pushing the country towards a civil war,” he said.

Ahmed invoked the holy Koran to eliminate “the seeds of hatred and the poison which are now deep rooted in society. The community must know follow the commandments (Koran) of Allah and teachings of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) to achieve the bigger objective of eliminating hatred spread by evil”.

Earlier, the protesters had taken out a rally to Variety Square where they paid homage to mark the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.

Lawyer Akshay Samarth, in his address at Samvidhan Square, said the assassination of Gandhi was a conspiracy to divide the nation. “Those who follow the doctrine of Godse have divided the nation. They are applying the British formula of divide and rule,” he said.

Jamiat Ulema Hind Siraj Ahmed said that those in power must not think this will remain forever. “Before them, there were Pharaohs, Hitler, Mussolini who thought they would rule forever but were proved wrong,” he said.

Irani, who was on a day’s visit to her constituency Amethi, specially targeted the Aam Adami Party and accused it of supporting Shaheen Bagh protest where anti-national slogans are being raised.

“Ek aakrosh hai poore desh mein ki AAP aur baki wo rajnaitik dal jo 2019 ka chunav nahi jeet paye desh ko todne ki baaton ka samarthan kar rahe hain. Janata ke beech mein desh virodhi naare de rahe hain (There is resentment across the country against AAP and other political outfits who lost 2019 Lok Sabha elections and are now raising slogans to divide the country),” she said

The minister added that AAP leader Manish Sisodia has already given support to Shaheen Bagh protest.

“Jo Shaheen Bagh ki aad mein apni rajniti kar rahe hain aur desh virodhi naare de rahe hain, kya unki rajniti ka sthar itna gir gaya ki ab virodhi dal desh ko baatne ki baat kar rahe hain...Jinnah wali Azadi ki baat kar hare hain (Those doing politics in the garb of Shaheen Bagh have stooped so low that they are now trying to break the country by seeking its partition like Jinnah),” she said.

Later in the day Irani addressed a public meeting during Ganga Yatra at Kalakankar in Pratapgarh where she said a true Indian will not stage a sit-in at Shaheen Bagh and speak of breaking the country. “I will pray to Ganga maiyya for better sense among people who depend on this land (India) for survival but praise others,” she said.

422,['31/01/2020'],"No pact after OTS, yet OCW reaping benefits","This story is from January 31, 2020

Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) continues to commit irregularities to benefit private water operator Orange City Water Private Limited (OCW). In latest moves, the civic body has started returning the penalty and disbursing amount towards the escalated cost to the OCW before executing a revised agreement with the operator.

Also, for the last 11 months OCW has been executing the ambitious 24X7 Water Supply Project without check from the third party.

In 2011, NMC had signed an agreement with OCW to execute the 24X7 project, and to operate and maintain water works. As per agreement, the NMC was supposed to ensure completion of project within five years at the cost of Rs387.86 crore and levy penalty on OCW in case of breach of conditions.

NMC had levied penalty of Rs41 crore on OCW between March 1, 2012, and March 31, 2018 on OCW for poor performance in handling water supply, failure to ensure equal water distribution in all areas, inordinate delay in completion of the project, appointment of expats (experts in water from foreign countries) etc.

The OCW failed to complete project by March 1, 2017. As a result, the cost of works executed till March 31, 2018, escalated by Rs52 crore.

Despite strong opposition and loss of over Rs374 crore, the NMC general body in March last year had approved one time settlement (OTS) scheme for OCW in which civic body agreed to release penalty, pay escalated cost, extend project deadline by 18 months and extension of five years on achievement of performance parameters from March 1, 2017 to March 1, 2022.

To execute OTS, the agreement needed to be amended or a revised agreement signed. Accordingly, the NMC water works department submitted draft of revised agreement with legal department. An official from NMC water works department told TOI that the draft is pending with legal department.

NMC sources told TOI water works department and special purpose vehicle Nagpur Environmental Services Limited (NESL) have started releasing penalty amount and escalated cost to OCW from last few months. “Very few amount of penalty and escalated cost remains to be disbursed,” sources said.

NMC water works department official confirmed that they are disbursing the money and providing all benefits of OTS to OCW. “There should be no issue as we are acting as per OTS approved by general body and draft of agreement. NMC will not incur any financial loss,” he said.

Chairman of NMC water works consultative committee Vijay Zalke agreed that providing all benefits of OTS to OCW before finalizing agreement was improper. Zalke also said that he will collect detailed information and take appropriate action.

Congress corporator Praful Gudadhe said this again proves how office-bearers and officials are working only in the interest of OCW and not for NMC and people. “OTS itself was a big scam. BJP got it approved in general body by misusing its majority. Maha Vikas Aghadi government and new municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe should conduct an inquiry, scrap OTS and save over Rs400 crore public money,” he said.

As the 24X7 project got delayed, project management consultant (PMC) DRA Consultants’s agreement for operation and maintenance of water supply lapsed on February 28 and project on March 31 last year. Still, NMC has allowed execution of project without continuation of the consultant or appointing a new one.

PMC work was to monitor work as per approved designs, check quality and approve bills. For last 11 months, NMC delegates, who are just 10 for entire city, are approving works and bills without any third party check.

OCW refused to comment stating NMC is the proper authority to speak on the issue.

UNPLUGGED LEAKAGES

* NMC and OCW signed an agreement to execute 24X7 Water Supply Project, operate and maintain water works in 2011

* NMC was supposed to ensure completion of project in five years at the cost of Rs387.86 crore and levy penalty on OCW for breach of conditions

* NMC levied penalty of Rs41 crore between March 1, 2012 and March 31, 2018 on OCW for various types of violations

* OCW failed to complete project within deadline which resulted in cost escalation of Rs52 crore till March 31, 2018

* NMC general body approved OTS to OCW by waiving off penalty, cleared escalated cost, extended project’s deadline by 18 months and achievement of performance parameters by 5 years

* NMC incurred loss of over Rs374 crore from OTS

* Civic body was supposed to extend OTS benefits to OCW after executing a revised agreement

* Draft of agreement pending with legal department for verification

* NMC disbursing penalty amount, escalated cost and also extending other benefits of OTS

* Also, project going on without consultant’s check for last 11 months

Bhubaneswar: The state government has decided to conduct daily health check-up of people residing within 3-km radius of epicentre of bird flu in the city for next 10 days. The three-day long culling operation, which started in and around the poultry farm of Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT), came to an end on Thursday while a high-level team from the Centre visited the infected areas and took stock of the situation.

“Though there is no history of any transmission of virus from animal to human in the state, but as precautionary measure we have decided to conduct health check-up of people in the locality,” said health secretary Nikunja Bihari Dhal.

However, the rapid response teams will continue sanitation process within 10-km radius of the infected area and collect random samples of poultry birds to ensure that no strain of the virus is left in the area, an official source said. “A health team will visit households in the locality from where the virus has been detected and conduct screening of people suffering from common cold and cough. If any person suspected then his or her blood samples will be sent for further tests,” said director, public health, Ajit Kumar Mohanty.

The central team will monitor the measures being taken to tackle bird flu in the state for next 10 days. “It is good that the virus was detected before it was too late. All measures have been taken according to the guidelines and situation is well under control and there is nothing to panic. Sanitisation and surveillance works in the area will continue,” said Alok Vajpai, a member of the three-member team from Union ministry of health.

Though the bird flu scare has little impact on midday meal, the chicken price has dropped from Rs 180 per kg to Rs 160 in the city. “Except for one locality in Bhubaneswar, bird flu has not been detected anywhere in the state. So there is no point in not serving eggs in midday meal. District administrations will decide whether egg will be served in midday meal or not after discussing the situation with chief district veterinary officer,” said state nodal officer for midday meal Gangadhar Sahoo.

In wedding receptions, mutton, prawn and fish are preferred than chicken items. But, consumption of chicken has not stopped completely. “We included mutton in the main course instead of chicken after bird flu was detected in the city and served chicken in starter during the wedding reception of my sister and people ate without hesitation,” said Durga Prasad Nayak, a resident of Satya Nagar.

BHOPAL: Chief minister Kamal Nath organised a Hanuman Jaap on the martyrdom anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on Thursday, but it led to political controversy when BJP criticised it.

The saffron party took a dig at Congress, claiming its ‘soft Hindutva’ will not work. CM Nath shot back, “We are all religious. I don’t know why BJP gets stomach ache when we visit temples and talk about religion. Is BJP the sole guardian of Hindutva? It only misuses religion for political gains. Congress does not mix religion with politics.”

Nath is a devotee of Lord Hanuman and has installed a mega idol at Chhindwara. Banners put up at Minto Hall, the venue of the Hanuman Jaap on Thursday, described Nath as ‘Hanuman Bhakt’.

The BJP, however, criticized Congress, with party state president Rakesh Singh saying, “If Congress thinks it can confuse the majority population by chanting Hanuman Chalisa, they are mistaken. They are free to perform any religious ritual, but people of the country cannot be misled by any such acts.”

Nath hit back with a stinging retort: “I do not want to talk about Rakesh Singh as he is prone to making statements without applying his brain. The Hanuman Jaap is being organised for the welfare, progress and development of people of Madhya Pradesh . I urge BJP leaders to join this religious event in the interest of public welfare,” Nath said.

Ever since it came to power in Madhya Pradesh, the Congress government has undertaken a series of steps to show its Hindutva side. It has announced Ram Van Gaman Path, promised to build 1,000 cow sheds and provide funds for construction of permanent Ramlila platforms in urban local bodies. Recently, the government decided to contribute to the development of Sita Mata temple in Sri Lanka.

NEW DELHI: Demanding strict action against the person who opened fire in the Jamia area and injured a student on Thursday, dozens of people, including students from different universities, gathered outside the Delhi police headquarters at ITO around 7 pm on Thursday. They also sought action against the police personnel deployed at the incident site who allegedly did not do anything to stop the gunman from firing at the protesters.

Police, however, immediately detained the gathered students and took them to IP Estate and Rajendra Nagar police stations. They were released after an hour.

“We want strict action against the person who went around brandishing guns and even injured a student. What is most worrisome is the way the police stood there doing nothing. We cannot let them go scot free,” said a DU student. He was earlier detained while participating in a human chain in protest against CAA and NRC.

Many others demanded action against BJP leaders Anurag Thakur, Kapil Mishra and Parvesh Verma. “Today’s incident is the result of hate speeches by these leaders. When Delhi Police can file sedition charges against students, why are they being spared? It is unfortunate that BJP is using hate speeches to polarise voters,” said Kawalpreet Kaur, a DU student and an AISA activist.

“Somebody could have died in the firing today. However, police and BJP seem to be least bothered,” said Sanya, a first-year student.

Around midnight, over 200 students again gathered near the police headquarters to protest and the carriageway in front of it had to be blocked.

426,['31/01/2020'],Ganjam gears up to check accidents on fatal stretch,"This story is from January 31, 2020

Berhampur: The Taptapani ghat road under the Mohana-Digaphandi stretch on National Highway-326 (Vijayawada to Ranchi) has turned into a death trap. Since May 21 last year, at least 20 people have died on this stretch, including the eight who were killed when a passenger bus fell off a bridge early on Wednesday morning.

The latest incident has raised question mark on the district administration’s efforts to check accidents. Ganjam district collector Vijay Amruta Kulange has asked engineers of the National Highway to conduct an inquiry to ascertain if there’s any defect in road construction or whether there is lack of road safety measures for which accidents have been occurring.

“We have already submitted a report on road safety measures to the superintendent engineer, National Highway, Berhampur, after conducting an inquiry following Wednesday’s accident,” said Ashok Das, executive engineer, National Highway’s Paralakhemundi division.

“As part of road safety measures, signages have been put up on the spot along with tree-guard and cross barriers,” Das said. “The width of the road is 7 metres. We think there was no fault on our part as far as road safety measures on the stretch are concerned,” he added.

Eight persons, including six women, died and more than 30 were injured when a Berhampur-bound passenger bus fell 20 feet below from a bridge near Taptapani ghat, about 60 km from here. The condition of most of the injured persons are said to be stable.

On Thursday, BJP’s Ganjam district unit president Bibhuti Jena said a traffic post should have been set up in the area and traffic police deployed to check the speed of vehicles at the black spots. “Speed-breakers must be set up on the stretch to control the speed limit of vehicles,” Jena said.

Aska sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Suryamani Pradhan said patrolling was frequently conducted in the area. Checking of vehicles was also done frequently in the area and drivers were advised to control their speed.

“Lack of experienced drivers and violation of road safety rules led to most of the accidents on this stretch of the highway,” Pradhan said. “The drivers should ensure that the vehicles are in proper condition and that they don’t fall sick and neither drink and drive. Continuous driving is also dangerous,” he added.

MUMBAI: Showing solidarity with hundreds of women staging a sit-in against the Citizenship Amendment Act, National Population Register and National Register of Citizens at Mumbai Bagh or Mumbai’s Shaheen Bagh at Nagpada, historian and Mahatma Gandhi’s grandson Rajmohan Gandhi said on Thursday his grandfather would have stood with the protesters.

“I am Gandhi’s grandson, but you are real Gandhians because you are protesting something which you think is wrong,” he said. “Gandhi would have sided with you because he believed in ahimsa (non-violence) and your protests are peaceful,” he told the women who have been staging a sit-in on Morland Road at Nagpada from the intervening night of January 26 and 27.

He said, “People will try to provoke you, insult you with statements. Don’t get provoked. Keep protests peaceful,” he said. He, along with many activists and protesters, observed a two-minute silence of 2 minutes in memory of the Mahatma who was martyred on January 30, 1948. Activists Firoz Mithiborewala, Fareed Khan and filmmaker Anand Patwardhan had accompanied Gandhi. “Rajmohanji’s visit gave women protesters new courage,” said Khan.

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Thursday said incidents such as the random firing by a youth on anti-CAA protesters in Jamia area would not be tolerated and directed the city police commissioner to take strictest possible action in the case.

“There was a firing incident in Delhi today... I have spoken to Delhi Police commissioner about it and directed him to take strictest action. The Centre will not put up with such incidents, there will be serious consequences and guilty will not be spared,” Shah said in a tweet on Thursday afternoon.

In another tweet a couple of hours later, Shah announced that Delhi Police special commissioner Pravir Ranjan had been tasked to hold a comprehensive probe into the firing incident.

Shah’s statement came in the backdrop of the opposition’s attacks on the home ministry and Delhi Police for failing to prevent the attack. However, special commissioner Ranjan rebutted the charge that police personnel deployed near Jamia were lax. He said the incident could not be prevented as it happened in a “split second”.

429,['31/01/2020'],Cabinet to bring ordinance to authorise govt to shut slaughterhouses in state,"This story is from January 31, 2020

Urban development minister Madan Kaushik said that the Cabinet hasdecided to amend the minor mineral policy

Dehradun: The Uttarakhand cabinet on Thursday gave a nod to a slew of proposals, including giving authorisation to the state government to close slaughterhouses, allocating 200 acres of land for AIIMS Rishikesh and amending the Uttarakhand Minor Mineral Policy, 2001 among other decisions.

Among the major decisions, the cabinet, chaired by chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, approved a proposal to promulgate an ordinance which gives power to the state government to shut down slaughterhouses. Till now, the municipal corporation concerned used to take a call on this matter.

The decision comes in the wake of the slaughterhouse at Manglaur in Haridwar district being a major issue of contention with many especially those from the saffron party being against having a slaughterhouse near the holy city. CM Rawat had also categorically said that slaughterhouses would not be allowed in Haridwar.

In another major decision, the cabinet also decided to amend the Uttarakhand Minor Mineral Policy, 2001, thereby permitting mining on the banks of rivers up to 3-metre-depth. Earlier, mining was permitted upto a depth of 1.5 metre.

Providing the rationale for the decision, government spokesperson and urban development minister Madan Kaushik said, “We have decided to amend the Uttarakhand Minor Mineral Policy, 2001, to boost revenue in the mining sector.”

Among other decisions, the Uttarakhand government decided to take back the 830 acres of land in Rishikesh which was leased out to drug manufacturing company, Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited (IDPL). The lease is ending in March.

Out of the total land, 200 acres would be given to AIIMS Rishikesh and the remaining would be transferred to the tourism department.

Apart from that, the cabinet decided to increase the upper age limit for recruitment to technical posts in the state roadways department from 35 to 42 and the time for hearing VAT-related cases from January 2020 to March 2020.

It was also decided to set up a residential college at Jaiharikhal in Pauri district. The college would be operated through a trust, which would have the chief minister as its chairperson and education minister as its vice-chairperson. An NGO would provide 60 % fund for the project.

In decisions related to Kumbh 2021, the cabinet approved the creation of 31 posts for the mega festival to be held in Haridwar next year. The posts include those of deputy mela adhikari, information officer, assistant accountant, senior assistant, junior assistants, data entry operators etc.

430,['31/01/2020'],"4 years on, state zoo authority is a nonentity lacking powers","This story is from January 31, 2020

Nagpur: Four years after Maharashtra Zoo Authority (MZA) was set up with an aim to streamline functioning of zoos in the state, the authority itself has become a nonentity.

In 2014, then forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar had made announcement in his budget speech to set up MZA. Accordingly, it came into existence on December 30, 2015.

The main aim of setting up the MZA was to monitor and improve zoos, rescue centres and transit treatment centres in the state. Maharashtra has nine zoos, four rescue centres and four transit treatment centres. Set up with much fanfare, there is no regular head to lead the authority for the last 16 months. It also doesn’t have a full-time wildlife veterinarian and an engineer.

The last chief conservator of forests (CCF) and member-secretary of MZA, SS Dole, retired on August 31, 2018. Since then, additional charge was handed over to CCF and Pench field director RS Govekar .

Govekar planned to improve things in the MZA, but he is already in-charge of two tiger reserves (Pench and Bor) and two sanctuaries (Tipeshwar and Umred-Karhandla) along with buffer area of Pench, besides several other responsibilities.

Govekar told TOI, “Last year, we had discussions with top officials in the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) on autonomy for MZA, but were told that there is no such provision in the Wildlife Protection Act.”

Under the Wildlife (Protection) Act (WPA), 1972, the controlling body of all zoos is Central Zoo Authority (CZA), Delhi, which executes its decision through state chief wildlife warden (CWLW) in whom statutory powers are vested. To decentralize work of zoos from CWLW and better functioning, MZA came into existence, but the authority has been reduced to an insignificant body.

Former MZA chief Dole says, “When CZA has all statutory powers to monitor zoos, the MZA becomes redundant. We had proposed autonomy to MZA by seeking powers to release grants to zoos in the state, but the proposal was rejected. Every aspect right from master plans to any preparatory works need CZA approval.”

Dole added, “MZA’s role is minimized as all the zoos, barring Gorewada and a zoo in Mumbai, are managed by either separate institutions or municipal corporations. These bodies are also opposed to interference in their affairs. Moreover, with CZA having inherent powers under the WPA, the state zoo authority has been marginalized.”

In the last four years, the MZA has organized a few training workshops and has nothing much to its credit. Its governing council and executive committee also doesn’t meet regularly. The MZA was entrusted with a major task to appoint consultants for the ex-minister’s dream projects to start leopard and tiger safaris in Chandrapur, Pune and Amravati, but these safaris have derailed.

The last time MZA was in news was for ugly fight between an accountant and divisional forest officer (DFO) Kamlakar Dhamge in which the latter was injured.

“We expect MZA to liaison with CZA to streamline working of state zoos and address their problems. The Maharajbagh zoo plan is pending with the CZA for long. The high court has already asked to grant recognition to the zoo,” said Dr SS Bawaskar, zoo officer in-charge.

Dhenkanal: An elephant died and another was injured after being hit by a truck near Jibankhol in Dhenkanal district on NH-55 early on Thursday. The elephant died on the spot, said a forest official.

Another elephant, which was injured in the mishap, reportedly ran away into the forest while its broken tusk lay near the spot, said the official.

An official source said a herd of 24 elephants were crossing the NH-55 at Jibankhol when a truck hit them around 4.30am. Police said the truck driver failed to see the animals either due to darkness or dense fog.

The spot has been marked ‘elephant corridor’ by the forest department. Owing to the mishap, road traffic was disrupted for long hours. Hundreds of trucks, buses and other heavy vehicles were stranded for hours on Dhenkanal-Angul highway stretch.

Locals alleged that due to lackadaisical attitude of the forest department, the mishap occurred.

Santosh Kumar Behera, sarpanch, Odapada, alleged, “Though the herd has been crossing the National Highway everyday, the forest department has not taken any measures for the jumbos’ safe passage.”

Arabinda Kumar Majhi, a wildlife expert from Dhenkanal, said, “For past 10 years, elephants have been crossing the NH-55 and a railway line to reach the Brahmani river for water. Though the forest department is aware of this, it has not taken any measures for jumbos’ safety.”

Dhenkanal DFO B P Acharaya said, “We have put signboards on both side of the road, marking them as elephant corridor. Besides, our staff in morning and evening alert motorists to be careful while crossing the road.”

The DFO said, “We have seized the truck. As both the truck driver and helper are on the run we couldn’t ascertain what exactly caused the mishap.”

“We will register a case and investigate into the incident. We buried the elephant after conducting postmortem. Besides, we would track the injured elephant to treat it,” the DFO said.

The DFO maintained that they will adopt all safety measures to protect the elephants. “We will adopt methods that are being followed in other states to protect the elephants, particularly when they cross the National Higways,” the officer said.

On Feb 1, Narendra Modi led NDA government will table its first budget after coming to power for the second time. Though there have more than 300 amendments in the GST regime, industrial fraternity wants further ‘simplification’ and lowering of GST on some items.

Voicing his concern, chairman of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Bhopal zonal council, Animesh Jain said, “Government has taken several steps to improve the industrial scenario and the economy, but a comprehensive road map also needs to be made for the next two-three years. It would help industrialists to invest.” Jain went on to add, “Whenever some investment is done with an eye to generate employment, by the time production starts, some new policy comes into play. Therefore, a holistic plan, at least for the next two-three years, is required. It would give clarity on how to move ahead.”

Though a lot of changes have been done on the GST front, Jain said, there is scope for doing a lot more on this front. The CII chairman said that automobile sector also needs government’s attention. “This sector contributes almost 18 % to the economy ; it needs greater attention. GST should be lowered for the vehicles in Rs 15 lakh to 16 lakh bracket,” he added.

City -based industrialist and founder member Confederation of MP industry service and trade (COMPIST), Akash Jain said, “There have been so many amendments that it has become difficult for the industrialists and chartered accountants to keep pace with these changes. Government should also take initiatives to increase the consumption and think of providing income tax relief to individuals.” Chairman of Bhopal chambers of commerce, Lalit Jain, said, “Drugs for cancer should be made tax -ree.”

Chandrapur: A woman consumed poison in Jiwti police station on Thursday, after cops arrested her allegedly innocent husband for illegal possession and sale of liquor . While the woman has been admitted to Gadchandur rural hospital and is battling for life, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) has demanded strong action against PSO of Jiwti police station.

Sources informed that Jiwti police had got a tip-off that the mother of one Pooja Kalpe is involved in illegal liquor sale, and raided her house on Wednesday night. They seized a few bottles of liquor, however, instead of registering an offence against the woman, the cops decided to book Aakash Kalpe, son-in-law of the woman for possession of liquor. The woman, whose name could not be ascertained, claimed that she had begged the cops not to do so, since her daughter Pooja Kalpe and son-in-law live separately at Shengaon. However, they did not agree, and called them to the police station the next morning.

On Thursday morning, the woman and her daughter Pooja went to the police station. However, cops said the offence was registered against her son-in-law Aakash Kalpe, and asked them to bring him to the police station. Shocked and baffled by the police action to register offence against her husband, Pooja consumed poison in the police station in an attempt to commit suicide.

Her mother claimed the cops did not even bother to take her daughter to hospital for treatment, and the family had to arrange to take the woman to Gadchandur rural hospital more than 25km away.

MNS Rajura wing has taken up the issue and demanded inquiry into the matter, and action against the PSO Jiwti for his alleged insensitive behaviour.

435,['31/01/2020'],"I’m going to school, Jamia shooter said at home","This story is from January 31, 2020

JEWAR: A little before Thursday noon, he picked up his bag and told his grandfather he was going to school. A bit late for school, but then his family was away for a wedding in Jhajjar and no one really was asking questions. He said he would head to the wedding after classes.

The wedding, in reality, was far from his mind: the boy, a Class XII commerce student at a private school, had packed a gun in his bag and headed straight for Delhi ( Shaheen Bagh was the subject of all the recent hatred he had been spewing on Facebook). A couple of hours later, his relatives and friends saw him on national TV — some on the Facebook Live he webcast before that — wildly brandishing a gun at Citizenship Amendment Act protesters near Jamia Millia Islamia and shooting at a student who tried to stop him.

His 80-year-old grandfather, the only one home when the news broke, was in a state of disbelief. “I have no idea how he got a gun or who asked him to do this,” he said. The shooter’s mother teaches at a primary school. His father runs a store that is at the front of the house in a narrow Jewar village road that threads through a warren of single and double-storey homes stacked against each other. The boy’s brother is 13 years old. His family shares the two-storey ancestral home with the family of his deceased uncle — an aunt and a cousin who is about as old as he is.

Within minutes of the news of his arrest, the lane was bustling with people, curious and confused in equal measure. Relatives and friends who had gathered said they had never seen a violent streak in him and insisted he was a well-behaved boy, drawing a personality sharply divergent from the one his Facebook friends saw: of undisguised hatred towards one community and his own violent intentions.

“He’d stay home and not get too involved in things,” said Yogesh, a neighbour. But over the past few days, there had been a change in his behaviour when he was sullen and irritable. “He seemed unwell and disturbed about something. But we hadn’t expected things to take this turn,” he added.

A friend who went to school with the shooter said he was shocked. “He was always quiet. We drifted apart a little after we chose different streams after Class X — I picked science and he studied commerce,” said the friend. “We would meet during recess and sometimes at the end of the school day. I don’t know how he got involved in all this. I am shocked.”

What, then, was the trigger? Some speculated about community groups “brainwashing” him. Who he was at home and how he projected himself online were often at odds. “He held strongly nationalistic views. He would move around with certain groups, he would single out a community to abuse in his Facebook posts and would pick fights on social media,” said a neighbour.

His posts were widely commented on and many of the reactions were congratulatory. But the consistent rants of hatred and threats of violence from a place barely 90km from the national capital did not, surprisingly, come to the notice of Noida Police, which has a digital volunteer force of citizens and former cops specifically for this purpose. Noida police have in the last three months registered eight FIRs against people for writing ‘objectionable’ social media posts and made six arrests. Additional CP Sriparna Ganguly, who is also the spokesperson for Noida police, admitted they were unaware about the boy. “Our digital volunteers didn’t share any information about the suspect in question but we’re surely going to take cognisance of it and rectify things in future,” she said.

Bhopal: Former Union minister Uma Bharati said on Thursday that Madhya Pradesh chief secretary should ask government officials to not speak on controversial issues like CAA. She said that officials who want to work as social activists should resign and protest in Shaheen Bagh.

She said, ""The officials are behaving like activists in Madhya Pradesh. They should be controlled. I request the chief secretary to instruct government officials that they are not supposed to speak on certain issues in violation of service rules. If they want to work as social activists, they should resign and stage a protest in Shaheen Bagh.""

The BJP leader also hit out at the state government for misguiding the public with regard to CAA. ""Congress is trying to create a situation that prevailed in 1947, when India was partitioned. Those protesting against the Citizen Amendment Act don't know about the new law. People are being misled, but we will not allow that to happen,"" she said.

The BJP leader also disapproved of ex-minister Badrilal Yadav's objectionable remark against Rajgarh collector Nidhi Nivedita during a public meeting. She said that she does not support Yadav’s comment, but you cannot slap a person who is holding the Tricolour in his hands. “When chief minister Kamal Nath led an anti-CAA rally it was not stopped by authorities, how can they stop a demonstration in support of the new law and slap the leaders of opposition party?” said Bharati.

On BJP's inaction over Maihar MLA Narayan Tripathi's anti-CAA remarks, Bharti said, ""Tripathi is a rolling stone. He bites like lice. I will talk to BJP chief Rakesh Singh about this matter,"" said Bharati.

A student was hit by bullet during a protest march at Jamia on Thursday

NEW DELHI: Artist, curious reader, amateur photographer and theatre enthusiast — Shadab Farooq dons many hats. But his most important role, his friends claim, is that of a “hyperlocal pacifist.”

Farooq, the 23-year-old student, who was shot at by a gunman during an anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protest near Jamia Millia Islamia on Thursday, is originally from Jammu ’s Doda district. A second semester student at Anwar Jamal Kidwai Mass Communication Research Centre, Farooq had completed his graduation from the English department at Jamia before joining MCRC.

The mass communication student had been the voice of calm, especially after the new citizenship law came into effect, said Simran, a close friend. “He believes in non-violence, in the power of dialogue and in standing up for justice. When protests started at Jamia and police stormed into the campus, Shadab helped ferry people into ambulances and was there when the injured were admitted into hospitals,” she added.

On Thursday, Farooq and his friends reached Jamia Millia Islamia early to mobilise people to join the march to Rajghat in north Delhi. “We were ahead of the march just to scan the area and generally observe the conditions. There was a lot of police presence and they had barricaded the road leading to Sukhdev Vihar,” said Aamna, an eyewitness of the shooting.

Aamna said a man brandishing a gun suddenly appeared out of nowhere and began to shout. “He was facing us and we could very clearly see that he was waving a gun. He looked disturbed and it seemed like he would shoot. He kept on shouting yeh lo azaadi. Since the police was just a few metres away, we called out to them for help, but nobody did anything. They just stood there and watched,” she added.

She claimed that police apathy was apparent in the way they dealt with Farooq after he had been shot. “We repeatedly pleaded with the policemen to remove the barricade so we could take him to Holy Family Hospital. But the policemen did not listen to us. Farooq finally had to scale the barricade, with blood dripping from his left hand, to reach the hospital,” she added. After being administered first aid, the 23-year-old was referred to All India Institute Of Medical Sciences trauma centre.

“Ironically, Farooq’s birthday falls on Independence Day. And he was shot at on the same day that Nathuram Godse gunned down Gandhiji. The man who shot him seems to follow Godse’s ideology,” said Shafaq , a college senior.

There were seniors, classmates, members of Jamia’s theatre group and friends from different regions and religions waiting outside the trauma centre, reflecting the idea of India that students have been fighting to preserve. According to close friends who visited Farooq at the trauma centre, the shards from the bullet remained lodged in his left hand, but there was no nerve damage.

“If I had to use one word to describe Farooq, it would be brave. He knew he could get shot, but he did not want others to get injured. But we will never forget what happened today. In the end, we need to remember that he is a student who was shot because mainstream politicians are constantly calling for violence,” Simran added.

In an official statement given in the evening, Jamia authorities said that Farooq successfully underwent surgery and is recovering well. Farooq’s father, who is a teacher in Jammu, and his elder brother are expected to reach the capital on Thursday night.

We pleaded with the cops to remove the barricade, but they didn’t. Farooq finally had to scale the barricade with blood dripping from his hand, a friend says.

NEW DELHI: Kuldeep Kumar Sharma , deputy manager manning the press in the finance ministry where the budget documents are being printed, chose the call of duty over his personal loss — the death of his father.

The finance ministry on Thursday said Sharma lost his father on January 26 and being on budget duty, he was in the lock-in.

“Sharma is the key hand in completing budget document printing within a very tight schedule, owing to his 31 years of experience in the budget process. Displaying exemplary commitment, Sharma symbolised extraordinary sincerity towards his call of duty, ignoring personal loss, (sic)” the finance ministry said on Twitter .

Several finance ministry staffers are locked in for the printing of budget documents in the basement of North Block which houses the ministry. They do not have access to any phones to maintain highest level of secrecy. These staffers surface only after the finance minister ends the budget speech.

440,['31/01/2020'],BS-VI costs: Oil companies to raise rates by rupee 1 at one go in April,"This story is from January 31, 2020

Representative image

NEW DELHI: State-run fuel retailers will raise fuel prices by 50 paise to Re 1 per litre in one go from April to recover investments made for producing Bharat Stage-VI (BS-VI, akin to Euro-VI standard) petrol and diesel.

“I don't think premium (for BS-VI fuels ) will be large enough for it to be staggered,” Sanjiv Singh, chairman of the country’s largest oil refiner and fuel retailer Indian Oil , said on Thursday after announcing trebling of the company’s net profit in the December quarter to Rs 2,339 crore.

Pump prices are linked to petrol and diesel rates in regional trading hubs — Singapore and Dubai — as well as the rupee-dollar exchange rate. Since international benchmark prices for BS-VI equivalent fuels are higher, domestic rates will also have to rise. “We are in the process of working out the implications of supplying BS-VI fuel from April,” Singh said.

State-run companies appear to have received a nod from the parent oil ministry for a one-time increase, using the window provided by benign benchmark prices and no state elections in sight. Crude prices are in the comfort zone and product prices are expected to face deflationary pressure as coronavirus casts a shadow over trade, air traffic and global economic growth revival in general.

India is set to leapfrog from BS-IV to BS-VI standard, which has nearly the same — or better in some regards — emission level as a CNG ( compressed natural gas ) vehicle, from April 1. Delhi had switched to BS-VI two years before the deadline, while the entire NCR (national capital region) covering neighbouring cities in UP and Haryana had been getting cleaner fuels since October 2019.

Singh said IOC refineries have started producing BS-VI grade fuel and the same will reach depots across the country by next month. “We are very much sticking to the April 1 deadline,” he said. The company has invested Rs 17,000 crore to upgrade its refineries, while the total investment made by all state-run refiners is pegged at Rs 30,000 crore.

“Switchover to BS-VI fuel supplies by IOC's marketing and retail network is also in full swing across the country. As per current progress, about 80% of IOC's 121 bulk storage terminals/depots will achieve the conversion from BS-IV to BS-VI fuels by January 31. In the markets catered to by them, 100% dispensing of BS-VI fuels at petrol/diesel stations is likely to be achieved by the end of February,” Singh said. “IOC is confident of supplying BS-VI fuels across India well ahead of the deadline,” he added.

Visakhapatnam: In light of the state government’s proposal to make Visakhapatnam the executive capital of the state, the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation ( APSRTC ) has come up with a fresh proposal to hire school buses for passenger transport in the near future.

This proposal was mooted as part of RTC’s necessary arrangements to meet the projected rush of passengers if the city were to become the executive capital. The purpose of this proposal is to improve the public transport system of the city.

Currently, APSRTC runs 600 buses in the city that carry nearly 7 lakh passengers along 45 different routes every day. Sources project that the city might need at least 1,000 buses to meet the expected rush.

Sources informed that Madireddy Pratap, managing director of APSRTC held an in-camera meeting with Visakhapatnam staff to discuss the future of organisation and infrastructure facilities after the city becomes the executive capital.

The managing director is also believed to have met managements of private bus operators and operators that run school buses to get their opinion on the proposal of hiring these buses when they are not in service, like on Sundays, Pongal holidays, Dasara and summer vacation.

“It is difficult to procure new buses. The new proposal came up for discussion at the in-camera meeting,” an APSRTC official told TOI on condition of anonymity.

However, a senior official of road transport authority (RTA) does not think that the RTC’s proposal is viable.

“We were not invited to the meeting. But the proposal to hire buses is not practical. Every school bus runs without a gap. In summer vacations, these buses go for fitness maintenance,” the official said.

MUMBAI: A Motor Accident Claims Tribunal recently ordered an insurance company and the owner of a dumper truck to pay a total compensation of around Rs 1.02 crore to the wife, minor daughter and parents of a 39-year-old man who died after the heavy vehicle rammed into his bike on the Western Express Highway in 2013.

The victim, Darryl Dsouza, a Mira Road resident was working at a private firm and earning a monthly salary of Rs 42,000 at the time of the incident. The tribunal found the impact of the hit had caused his helmet to fall off, and the victim had suffered severe head injuries.

The victim's wife, Bernadette Dsouza, was riding pillion when the accident occurred. Seeking a compensation of Rs 1 crore, the family told the tribunal at 6.45 am on May 21, 2013, the dumper belonging to Thane-based Reliable Enterprises was being driven at high speed when it rammed into the bike. Darryl died before being admitted to hospital.

ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co Ltd tried to pin the blame on the victim. It submitted he was not wearing a helmet at the time of the accident.

The tribunal said this did not mean the offending driver had the licence to hit a driver who was without a helmet. Referring to the FIR, the tribunal held Darryl was wearing a helmet and, after being hit by the dumper, the helmet fell off and he came under the dumper's wheel.

While calculating the compensation amount, the tribunal considered the victim's age, salary, future earning capacity, the nature of loss suffered by his family members and funeral expenses. While the wife and child will get 40% of the compensation each, Darryl's parents will get 10% each.

MUMBAI: The Mumbai Police recently withdrew protection extended to nine builders who allegedly faced threats from the underworld, including a Bandra-based builder and member of Waqf board, saying most of the dreaded gangsters were lodged in jails. Police said security cover of celebrities, including film stars and VIPs, too would be reviewed as part of their annual assessment and security provided to them would be downgraded.

Joint commissioner of police (crime) Santosh Rastogi said, “The crime branch has made an assessment and removed security given to nine people.” He said dreaded gangsters were in jail and it was not possible for them to issue threats over cellphone. Police said with CCTV cameras and high-density jammers now inside jails, it was almost impossible for an undertrial to use cellphones from inside the jail.

With gangster Ravi Pujari arrested in Senegal, and Bunty Pandey and Chhota Rajan arrested and lodged in Tihar jail, police officials said there were hardly any threats from the underworld in the city.

A fortnight after Mumbai Police arrested gangster Ejaz Lakdawala (50) from Bihar, they withdrew security cover given to Khalid Babu Qureshi, a Bandra-based developer and BJP functionary and member of the Maharashtra waqf board. Crime branch officials said Khalid was not alone, they had withdrawn security of others too who were apparently on Lakdawala’s hit-list.

It was Khalid’s complaint in November last year against Lakdawala that led the police to locate the gangster in Bihar. Lakdawala was picked up after his daughter Shifa alias Sonia Shaikh was arrested while trying to leave the country on a fake passport. Lakdawala, a gangster earlier close to Dawood as well as Chhota Rajan, had ben shuttling between Nepal and India via Bihar.

“Initially, when I lodged the complaint in November, I had mentioned that Lakdawala had threatened me and demanded Rs 50 lakh. Later in December, police requested me to include Shifa’s (Lakdawala’s daughter’s) name in my statement and I did. I was scared, but police assured me they were with me. Now I am a little uncomfortable as gangsters in the past have been active from jails,” Khalid told TOI. A crime branch official said during assessment, they found the Lakdawala gang was defunct and if there is any threat, they would provide security cover accordingly.

NEW DELHI: The National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) gave up arms on Thursday, marking an end to a 34-year armed struggle for a separate Bodoland state. Three days after signing of the Bodo accord, 1,615 cad- res from all four factions of NDFB laid down arms in front of Assam CM Sarbananda Sonowal at a ceremony in Guwahati.

Over 4,800 weapons, including AK rifles, light-machine guns and stenguns were laid down by the cadres, PTI reported. Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said a special rehabilitation policy would be prepared after talks with chiefs of the four factions to ensure cadres remain in the mainstream.

Nagpur: The menace of middlemen in defence procurements, who used to get commission for the deals, has been eliminated following the strict policies the Union government has put in place, said former group captain Dinkar Deshpande on Wednesday.

He was delivering a lecture on ‘Defence policy and former defence minister George Fernandes ’ at a programme titled Samvad, organized by Lohiya Adhyayan Kendra at Madhu Limaye Smruti Sabhagruh, Subhash Marg. Senior journalist Prakash Dubey and Suresh Agrawal were present.

“It was former defence minister George Fernandes who sought to end the reported practice of paying kickbacks in such deals, and usher in reforms in defence sector as he was forthright in his views to not compromise on national security. His dream was given shape by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah,” he said.

Deshpande said, “When the Kargil war broke out, Fernandes was the defence minister. Though a simple man, Fernandes handled the situation with an iron hand. He wanted to give Pakistan a befitting reply for its misadventure, and got success.”

Commenting on Kargil conflict, Deshpande said, “There were over 15,000 Indian soldiers fighting the war in an inclement weather, having to carry a hundred bullets and mounting the inhospitable terrain to scale 15,000 to 16,000 feet. The then air chief marshal and Fernandes meticulously planned and executed the strategy to teach Pakistan a lesson. Behind Fernandes’s simplicity lay a strong man who would take the enemy head-on.”

On economy, Deshpande said, “People are constantly complaining of a slowdown. But the economy will definitely take off by year 2022.”

Dubey spoke about Fernandes’s tryst with Pokhran nuclear tests in 1998. He said Fernandes had criticized China for providing war paraphernalia to Pakistan as he was an upright man.

Two scuba divers with the shipwreck (right) along the Baruva coast.

VISAKHAPATNAM: A team of scuba divers have discovered a shipwreck along the Baruva coast in Srikakulam district. This is the third such shipwreck to be discovered along northern Andhra Pradesh .

The ship whose wreckage has been found— Chilaka, sank in the Bay of Bengal in July, 1917. Around 80 people had lost their lives.

Upon diving six meters deeper, the divers discovered the scattered top deck of the ship.

The approximate length of the ship is 120-150 meters and its breadth is 25-30 meters. On touching the bow point of the ship, the draught of the ship was measured at six meters.

A letter to the publisher by Kalakshetra director Revathi Ramachandran says the foundation, an autonomous body under the Union culture ministry, “cannot allow any program that may instigate political, cultural and social disharmony”. “I find it astounding that it is okay for the mridangam to be played on that very stage of Kalakshetra, but one is uncomfortable with people saying cow is slaughtered to make it,” said Krishna, adding the book will be released on February 2.

MANGALURU: Suez India Private Limited , which has been given the contract to implement the 24x7 drinking water project in the city, has plans to open a 24x7 customer care centre.

Suez India officials said the customer care centre of the company will address grievances related to water supply in the city, round-the-clock, and solve their problems instantly. The company has already commenced a survey to implement the project in the city.

Valsan Moolakkat, executive engineer, Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation (KIUDFC), said ‘Jalasiri’, the 24x7 drinking water project, will be implemented by Suez Projects Private Limited (lead partner), Suez India and DRS Infratech at an estimated cost of Rs 792.4 crore.

In addition to the existing water storage facilities, 20 more tanks of different capacities will be built in the city as part of the Jalasiri project. To connect these new water storage facilities, 40km of new pipelines will be laid in the city. Pipes of various measurements from 200mm to 450mm will be used to pump water from storage areas to different parts of the city. Meanwhile, 25.1km of existing pipelines will be replaced with new ones. Additional underground sumps, eight boosting pump houses and a new water purification plant of 80MLD capacity will also be constructed. In addition, 1,388km of distribution lines will also be laid, and roads damaged during the work will be restored either by being concreted or asphalted, he said.

Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system of software and hardware will be used to monitor, gather, and process real-time data of water supply from the vented dam at Thumbe to all storage areas. A customer care number will address all types of grievances of people with regard to the water supply in the city. There will be no illegal connections once the Jalasiri project is completed, he said.

DHARWAD: Tracing the thread of women English writers in India to the Bengali Renaissance in the 19th century, former pro vice-chancellor of the English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU), Hyderabad Prof Maya Pandit-Narkar on Thursday said, “The history of women writers who took to English in our country is an inspiring one. These authors gave wind to a radical feminist movement after Independence, although one must note that the Sharana poets had already made headway in this direction as early as the 12th century.”

Prof Maya, delivering the first of the Sarojini Shintri Endowment Lecture Series organised by the department of studies in English of Karnatak University, highlighted the role that Constitutional reforms had essayed in improving the condition of women in the country. Pointing out that women who had seen through the stratagems of men’s ‘whiskey and cigar’ politics had taken the lead in emancipating themselves, Prof Maya added, “Women novelists such as Kamala Das and Arundhati Roy questioned man-made barriers such as caste and gender. Constitutional reforms helped women gain an education, employment and social participation.”

The other pioneering women, the contributions of whom she highlighted, were Cornelia Sorabji, Attia Husain and Venu Chitale, who were at the vanguard of movements against social evils such as Suttee, child marriage and dowry. “On the other hand, writers such as Kripabai Sathianadan and Manju Kapur, in their works, upheld the dignity of women, while Shobha De went a step further, discussing marriage and gender issues with candour,” Prof Maya added.

She sought to highlight the efforts made by global bodies such as the United Nations Organisation, several human rights’ bodies and governments to bring about a level-playing field. “Women writers also spoke of the New Woman. In both public and private sectors, several reforms have been drafted to further the cause of women. Modernisation, globalisation and privatisation have all helped women find their voice. The ‘long silence’ has finally shattered and the dignity of woman restored,” Prof Maya said.

In-charge vice-chancellor of Karnatak University Ashok Shiralashetti, varsity registrar Honnu Siddartha and head of the department of English Shamala Ratnakar were among those who shared their thoughts on the subject.

HUBBALLI: Stating that the Hubballi-Dharwad Bus Rapid Transit Systsm (HDBRTS) corridor was far from complete, and highlighting the unscientific execution of the high-profile infrastructure project, members of the Sama Sena on Thursday appealed to Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu not to officially inaugurate the dedicated bus lane.

Sena member Gurunath Ullikashi said that they would submit a memorandum to the Vice-President by fax, urging him against coming to the city to dedicate the corridor. “The Vice-President’s post is sanctioned by the Constitution, and the position he holds cannot be insulted. That is the reason we want to pre-empt his arrival here so that he does not officially inaugurate the incomplete corridor,” said Ullikashi.

He said that the quality of the flyover built on the corridor left a lot to be desired, besides pointing to the lack of lavatories at many stops along the dedicated lane. “Nearly Rs 1 crore has been spent on the construction of each bus stop but the lack of facilities at these terminals leaves commuters upset nevertheless,” Ullikashi added.

Ullikashi said that the many problems had been brought to the notice of Dharwad deputy commissioner Deepa Cholan, who served as the managing director of HDBRTS earlier. “We also mentioned the many persistent problems with the dedicated lane to former MD MG Hiremath and the incumbent director Rajendra Cholan. Although all of them gave us assurances of looking into these problems, nothing has been done on the ground. The formal inauguration is being arranged owing to pressure being exerted by Union minister Pralhad Joshi, Dharwad district in-charge minister Jagadish Shettar and MLA Arvind Bellad,” he added.

Ullikashi said that their outfit would launch a massive stir if the agencies concerned failed to fix the many problems marring commuter experience on HDBRTS within 100 days of its inauguration by Naidu.

Premanath Chikkatumbal, Yamanur Gudihal and others were present in the press conference.

HUBBALLI: To encourage people to learn Suryanamaskar and provide the younger generation a ready reckoner of sorts, a group of artists has sculpted 12 postures of the routine in iron. The set of life-size sculptures will be open for public viewing on Friday.

Sculptors of Artwaley, an art gallery, said they wanted to experiment with iron to create an easily relatable experience for all. While more people are turning to yoga, especially to tackle stress, blood pressure and even diabetes, not many are aware of the exact postures that make up the set of exercises that constitute Suryanamaskar, one of the artists said.

“While interacting with those who practise yoga, we came to know that many were not aware of the different types of asanas in the Suryanamaskar. This inspired us to explore how people could be better informed and instructed on how to strike the right postures for maximum benefit,” said Sudhanva Deshpande, art manager of Artwaley. “We decided to make 12 different Suryanamaskar sculptures in iron. A team of 12 artists worked for more than three months to craft the pieces.”

The sculptures depict Hastauttanasana, Padahastasana, Ashwa Sanchalanasana, Parvatasana, Pranamasana, Bhujangasana and Ashtanga Namaskara.

“Most sculptures these days are made from fibre but iron is a huge challenge,” said artist Manjunath Annigeri. “We used 40kg of iron to make each sculpture, and cut the iron into 1,000 -1,500 pieces for each sculpture. It required a lot of patience because any mistake in cutting the iron could upset the balance of the entire sculpture.”

Added artist Basavaraj Ganiger, “we worked 8 to 12 hours a day to give the final touches. We are happy that the sculptures are in keeping with anatomical specifications.”

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

MUMBAI: A special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act court has sentenced a van driver to 10 years’ imprisonment for sexually assaulting a six-year-old girl twice near her Andheri school in 2016. The court observed that the testimony of the victim (now 10) was fluent and without embellishments. The convict, Abdul Rehman, was also fined Rs 15,000. Of this, Rs 10,000 will be given to the girl.On February 11, 2016, the girl was in the school playground when a man dragged her away and sexually assaulted her. On her return home, she looked upset and her mother found stains on her innerwear. On repeated prodding, the girl revealed that an uncle had touched her inappropriately. The man sexually assaulted the girl again the next day. This time, he even threatened to kill her parents. The child went to a teacher and they tried to find the man, in vain.On returning home, the girl confided in her mother, who, along with a neighbour, went to the school. Rehman was standing at the school gate, and the girl identified him. On spotting the girl’s mother making note of his van’s registration number, the driver fled. The girl’s parents then approached the school management and lodged a police complaint a few days later.The convict claimed before the court that he was not present when the alleged incident occurred, but the court observed that he couldn’t produce witnesses to substantiate his claim. The court also observed though there were cameras in the school, the principal said they were of poor quality, and more cameras had been installed only after the incident.A medical officer told the court that no injury was found on the victim’s private parts. At this, judge H C Shende said, “The reason for me to believe the victim’s testimony is the medical officer’s explanation that due to her tender age and the time gap, healing process could be rapid.”“The court took into account there was no reason for a child to falsely accuse a man of sexual assault. Her family wasn’t acquainted with him and she did not commute by his van,” said prosecutor G Malankar. “The victim and her family had to move out of Mumbai because of the trauma.”Rehman’s counsel sought leniency as he had three dependents. “The victim was only six years old.

Mine lease holders had challenged an order of Goa bench of Bombay HC , which had stopped transportation of mined iron ore after March 15, 2018, by interpreting the SC ’s February 7, 2018, order allowing lease holders to manage their affairs and continue mining till March 15, 2018 as the period within which the minerals should have been transported out.

An SC bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant said there was no rationale behind stopping transportation of iron ore if the mineral was mined before March 15, 2018, and royalty had been paid to the Goa government.

BENGALURU: A communiqué has warned Karnataka MLAs that they could be suspended if they tried to disrupt the governor’s address to the joint session of the legislature next month.

The message, issued by the secretaries of Karnataka legislative assembly and council in the form of a bulletin, comes in the wake of the ruckus created by the opposition in the Kerala and West Bengal assemblies. Though it’s a routine exercise, it has angered Congress and JD(S) legislators, who allege the BS Yediyurappa government is trying to curtail their freedom of speech and right to protest.

The two parties have been itching to confront the six-month-old BJP government over various issues, and they see the upcoming session in the legislature as a great opportunity to ratchet up pressure.

Governor Vajubhai Vala will give a speech to the joint session on February 19. The secretaries of the assembly and council have cited Rule 26 of the House to issue the suspension warning for any disruption. “This is against the freedom of expression of MLAs. We will not allow our rights to be curbed. If I am speaking in the assembly, it is the voice of the people, and not mine. The speaker should act as per the Constitution,” Congress’s Siddaramaiah , who is the opposition leader in the assembly, said.

This week, Congress-led opposition MLAs blocked Kerala governor Arif Mohammed Khan’s path as he arrived in the assembly. They held placards with the messages “Call back governor” and “We resist CAA”. Karnataka council secretary K R Mahalakshmi said the latest directive to maintain order was a routine exercise. “The rule is regularly quoted by the secretariat when putting out the bulletin on the governor’s address. There is absolutely nothing new in this; it’s a routine affair,” Mahalakshmi said.

Assembly secretary MK Vishalakshi said: “The assembly only asks MLAs to maintain decorum and urges them to not disturb the governor while he is addressing the joint session.”

Instances of a serious disruption during the joint session in Karnataka have been rare.

Outgoing British high commissioner Dominic Asquith (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Outgoing British high commissioner Dominic Asquith Thursday expressed hope the Indian government will continue to address the CAA-related issues in the spirit of its manifesto commitment of “with all, development for all and trust of all”. He also said that even after Brexit, UK will remain India’s most important European partner and that the two sides will see expansion of trade diplomatic and security activities.

“There is protest in every single democracy. I refer back to the ‘with all, development for all, and trust of all (sabka saath, sabka vikas , sabka vishwas)’ as the objective set by this government and I am sure that in that ‘trust of all’ (is) the trust that it will be addressing the concerns that have been expressed about the CAA. But that is for the Indian government to deal with,” he said.

He also said the British side had not received any proposal from India to visit J&K following the repeal of Article 370 and that UK diplomats remained willing to visit J&K. Briefing the media, he also expressed regret over threats that, he said, Indian high commission may have felt because of violent protests on its premises. “I am glad to note that the last two protests have passed off without serious concern. That balance between the right to protest and ensuring that they don’t cross the line to illegality is a balance that is always difficult to maintain,” he said, adding that Metropolitan Police has the responsibility to do so.

On the anti-CAA resolutions in the European parliament, he said that parliaments as key democratic institutions have the habit to debate a variety of subjects.

Thirteen people died in the Kesarbai building collapse in Dongri on July 16, 2019

MUMBAI: Dongri police, probing the July 16 Kesarbai building collapse that killed 13 persons, recently added section 420 (cheating) under Indian Penal Code against five trustees of the building for collecting rent from tenants and allowing illegal work, which allegedly caused the crash.

Police had on July 23, 2019, registered an FIR against the trustees, civic officials and contractors under sections of IPC for causing death by negligence and causing grievous hurt by an act endangering the life or personal safety of others. While police have recorded statements of most victims and witnesses, they have not made any arrest.

""We invoked the section of cheating against five trustees of the building. They collected rent from tenants since 1996,"" said a police officer. At the time of registering the FIR, police did not mention the names of any accused. ""We are investigating the case and will file a charge-sheet soon,"" said the officer.

Prima facie, police found that illegal construction work had been carried out. The owner/trustees permitted or turned a blind eye to illegal extension or illegal construction, which led to the crash, police said.

Huma Zariwala, who lost her brother Arshan and niece Kashaf Aamir Azad, and whose mother Sajida was grievously injured, said police had not arrested any accused and she had approached the court for justice.

Sharjeel Imam in New Delhi on Wednesday. (Photo: ANI)

NEW DELHI: The Special Investigation Team (SIT) questioning JNU scholar Sharjeel Imam has found that he was not alone when he addressed the crowd at Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University . The people who accompanied him are under the scanner too.

On Thursday, for the first time the SIT questioned three Jamia students in connection with the violence that broke out on December 15. Sharjeel had given his speech in the campus two days before.

Police sources said the three students — Abdul Bari, Junaid Ashraf and Rahim Yusuf — are pursuing their bachelors’ degrees from Jamia. They were spotted during the riots and at the protest attended by Sharjeel. They were also reportedly found instigating the crowd during the riots. Their role during the protest on December 13 is being probed.

Police were not able to recover Sharjeel’s mobile phones during raids and a team will be sent to Bihar to look for them. His social media profiles are being scanned to identify his associates. Sources said during interrogation, Sharjeel first claimed that his mobile phone was in his room at JNU, but when police didn’t find it there, he claimed that it was at a friend’s house in Bihar.

Sharjeel mentioned three associates, one of them a classmate, who were aiding him in research for his speech. Efforts are being made to track them. Sources said he told police that he started raising his voice after he felt that the policies of the government were purposely being framed against his community. He was aware that he might get arrested for sedition, but still went ahead with his speeches.

The video of the speech has been sent for forensic analysis. His voice samples are also being analysed and they will be matched with the video. He is also being questioned about the role of his friends who helped him evade police.

469,['31/01/2020'],"Cut off from Haridwar, urns with ashes of Hindus piling up in Pakistan","This story is from January 31, 2020

Pakistan’s Hindus have the option to perform the rites at Sadh Belo, an island on the Indus river. But people ... Read More

NEW DELHI: Urns containing the ashes of deceased members of Hindu families in Pakistan are piling up in temples and crematoriums there as the community awaits restoration of train and bus links with India to perform the final rite of passage — immersion of the ashes in the Ganga.

“The majority of Hindus in Pakistan prefer to perform the last rites of their deceased family members in Haridwar. Now, ashes of the deceased are being preserved in urns and kept in temples, special rooms in crematoriums and, in some cases, even at home,” provincial assembly member Diwan Chand Chawla told TOI over phone from Sukkur in Sindh province on Thursday.

All transport routes between India and Pakistan have been shut since August last year, when bilateral ties snapped in the wake of Parliament nullifying Articles 370 and 35A that used to guarantee special status to Jammu & Kashmir.

Chawla, a former functionary of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement , urged the Indian and Pakistani governments to arrange a special train to the Attari-Wagah international border so that scores of Pakistani Hindus are able to take the ashes of their deceased family members to Haridwar for the final rites.

Pakistan’s Hindu community has the option of performing the last rites at Sadh Belo, an island on the Indus river with a cluster of temples and a gurdwara.

“However, people prefer to visit Haridwar. They would rather wait for the resumption of rail and road communication than hurriedly immerse the ashes somewhere else. A special train would do for now,” Chawla said.

Hindu families that can afford higher travel costs use private transport to first reach Lahore or Wagah rail station, from where they take taxis till the international border. After crossing the border on foot, they hire taxis till the nearest town they have visas for and then proceed to Haridwar.

“This journey is long and expensive,” Chawla said. “Only a few give it a shot.”

In the past, Hindus who couldn’t afford to travel to India would hand over the ashes of their loved ones to religious organisations, including the Hindu Cremation Ground Association in Karachi , to take the urns to Haridwar and perform the last rites on their behalf.

NAVI MUMBAI: Less than a week after a 40-year-old woman abducted a two-and-a-half-month-old infant from Agra and brought her here, the APMC police helped their Uttar Pradesh counterparts crack the case and apprehend the accused. The woman, who was arrested from Kopri village of APMC node on Wednesday, had struck a deal with a childless couple in Navi Mumbai who were to pay Rs60,000 for the baby girl.

Senior inspector Satish Nikam of APMC police station said, ""The infant's father had brought her to Abu Lala Dargah in Agra on January 25 in search of a cure for her ailment. The accused met him outside the dargah and claimed she would get the child treated at a mosque and took him there. The woman took the child inside the mosque, but when she did not return for long, the infant's father searched for her and later registered a kidnapping case.""

Nikam said the Agra police got a tip off that the kidnapper had come to Navi Mumbai. ""We traced her to a house in Kopri village and rescued the infant, who was with her, on Wednesday. The woman confessed she had kidnapped the infant to sell her to a childless couple in Kopri village.""

Police said the accused and the childless woman's mother were from the same native place in Agra. The accused, who the childless couple had not met, lied to the couple over the phone that she was pregnant, and that they could adopt the baby. She demanded Rs 60,000 for hospital expenses.

Dhankhar, who had gone to pay tribute at Barrackpore Gandhighat on Gandhi’s death anniversary, singled out Verma to say some “senior police personnel in uniform in front row kept on casually and freely reading newspapers”. “How can this indecorous act be done by men in uniform?” he said, asking Verma to probe the matter.

State power minister Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, also present at Gandhighat, said he along with the state home secretary had greeted the governor with folded hands but he did not reciprocate.

Behrampore: Nabajagaran Manch — comprising supporters of anti-Trinamool and anti-BJP groups —– blocked Sagarpara-Sheikhpara state highway and Dhanirampur-Bhaduriapara roads at Sahebnagar in Murshidabad’s Jalangi on Thursday morning with bodies of the two persons killed in Wednesday’s violence.

This followed the arre-sts of Kanak Sheikh, Rafiqul Islam and Abul Kalam Basar. “Two from our side died. But they arrested three of our supporters,” Manch leader Gulam Rahman Biswas said.

“We demand the arrest of Tahiruddin Mondal, the main accused.” Tahiruddin, TMC’s Jalangi block president, however, said: “What happened on Wednesday was nothing but a conspiracy to kill me.”

The blockade was lifted after senior police officers intervened.

Anarul Biswas (62) — the imam of a local mosque — and Salauddin Sheikh (17) were killed as violence raged during an anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act bandh. Trouble broke out between bandh enforcers from Manch and alleged TMC supporters. Though both sides oppose CAA, TMC opposed the bandh on the ground that a shutdown was unnecessary on Saraswati Puja.

Murshidabad SP Ajit Singh Yadav said: “Two FIRs have been lodged over Wednesday’s violence. We have arrested three, including two named in an FIR. Raids are on to nab more suspects.”

Representative image

KOLKATA: Five more women came forward to lodge complaints of extortion and blackmail against the two young Kolkata-based business family scions on Thursday, bringing the total number of complaints to a staggering 187.

Aditya Aggarwal and Anish Loharuka were arrested on Wednesday for allegedly extorting money from women after threatening to make public intimate moments captured with them on video. Kailash Yadav , a cook employed by Anish, was also arrested for involvement in the case that spanned several years.

Aggarwal’s family owns an ethnic-wear retail chain with a nationwide presence; Loharuka’s family owns multiple hotels in the city.

Two of the women — now married — have said they were still minors when they had a relationship with one of the accused, around six years ago, and had no idea they were being filmed.

The cops have got the statement of one complainant recorded before a magistrate. The statements of two others are in the process of being recorded. Only one of the complainants has confirmed that she had partly paid the extortion amount.

TOI called and texted both families but received no response, like Wednesday.

The police said the accused used advanced technology to run the extortion racket in a way that masked the actual number that they were using to call the victims. “They were using a virtual SIM, which is one of the best ways to hide your number,” explained an officer. “With this trick, you will get a virtual number whenever someone calls you, which is not registered to any person.” This, he said, was the reason it took some time to crack the actual number they were using.

“The evidence against the accused is only getting stronger,” another investigator said. “The total number of women whose intimate videos have been recovered has gone up to 187 now. We can now confirm that both Aditya and Anish figure in at least some of the videos that we have recovered. We are sending the hard disk to forensic experts for deeper analysis.”

Police sources said the accused even exchanged the videos among themselves and maintained a bank. “Anish’s cook, Kailash Yadav, was roped in because they did not wish to reveal their identity while making the extortion threats,” the officer added.

On Wednesday, a member of the latter’s family had told TOI that Anish was being “framed”. Joint commissioner of police (crime) Murlidhar Sharma refused to comment any further.

“The interrogation of the two prime accused revealed that they would befriend women and call them to different locations, where it seems, cameras were already set up to film their intimate moments. They developed a data bank of these videos and began to extort money around a year ago. In one case, they decided to extort Rs 5 lakh from a girl by convincing Yadav to call her up. The victim initially paid up. But then they demanded Rs 10 lakh more, prompting her to approach the cyber cell,” an official involved in the investigation said.

NEW DELHI: The Popular Front of India has issued a statement refuting allegations that it has financed the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

The organisation has alleged that “groups with vested interests have always been trying to raise different types of allegations against the organisation, and it is not going to cease with this allegation. They will continue with new allegations as long as the organisation continues its fight for justice.”

In a statement, M Mohamed Ali Jinnah , the general secretary of Popular Front of India, rejected allegations that the organisation is behind the violence and that investigations had revealed that about Rs 120 crore had been spent to carry out riots.

“Popular Front is not behind, but is part of the protests against CAA wherever it has presence,” the organisation said in response to the allegations. “Popular Front members and associates have never indulged in any sort of violence anywhere and it has never funded protesters anywhere with any amount of money. Let the ‘investigators’ produce substantiating evidence to support their allegations,” the statement said.

“The media reports quoting the Enforcement Directorate have dragged the name of an NGO working in the field of village development into the financial dealing of Popular Front without any evidence. A few reputed Supreme Court lawyers like Kapil Sibal , Dushyant Dave and Indira Jaising were also alleged to have received money from PFI to instigate anti-CAA protests,” the statement read.

“Popular Front outrightly denies all such allegations levelled with the intention of maligning the organisation and also the other individuals and organisations,” the statement further added.

MUMBAI: Saamna, the Shiv Sena mouthpiece, on Thursday tore into anti-citizenship law protester Sharjeel Imam’s “inflammatory and anti-national” statement and supported the government’s crackdown on him, raising fears of discord in the government it runs along with NCP and Congress.

In Sena’s rough and ready style, Saamna said Imam’s hands should be chopped off and hung up on the 22km highway — the ‘chicken’s neck’ — that links the Northeast with the rest of India. JNU student Imam was arrested on Tuesday for sedition and other charges.

Calling on the Centre to crush the “pest” of separatism, it wondered if there was a well-planned plot to “poison” the minds of students. “Imam is an IITMumbai alumni... This is a conspiracy to plant separatism (in the mind of the educated people) and take them on the path of extremism,” said the Saamna editorial. “The conspiracy is to perpetuate Hindu-Muslim disharmony and a prolonged civil war... Urban Naxalism is very much on. Add to this, the extremism of intellectuals which is being fanned by politicians,” it added.

This stand can bring Sena into direct conflict with Congress, which has been pro-active in the anti-CAA, anti-NRC protests across the country, and NCP, which claims the Elgar Parishad case was foisted on intellectuals and activists and wants it quashed.

Urging the Centre not to indulge in a political game, Saamna endorsed Amit Shah ’s statement that Imam’s ‘chicken neck’ remark was more dangerous than Kanhaiyya Kumar ’s ‘freedom’ utterances and that Imam’s next seven generations will not succeed in cutting the Northeast from the country.

RAIPUR: The Chhattisgarh cabinet on Thursday urged PM Modi to scrap the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ), saying that the law is discriminatory and against the spirit of the Constitution .

“On the one hand, this Act appears to be discriminatory towards illegal immigrants based on their religious beliefs, contradictory to Article 14 of Indian Constitution, and on the other, the Act has no provision for people from neighbouring countries such as Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Nepal, and Bhutan living in India,” reads CM Bhupesh Baghel ’s letter to PM Modi.

“Chhattisgarh is basically a state of people belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and OBCs, and most of these people are poor, illiterate and ill equipped, which will make it extremely difficult for them to complete the formalities under this Act,” Baghel said. “ CAA appears to be damaging the core spirit of the Constitution — secularism,” he said.

NEW DELHI: NCP’s Jitendra Awhad has said that Indira Gandhi tried to “throttle” democracy by imposing Emergency , prompting ally Congress to warn of a “befitting reply” if its ministers were insulted. Awhad later claimed that he was quoted “out of context”.

“Indira Gandhi tried to throttle democracy by imposing Emergency. That time nobody spoke against it openly. But opposition started from Ahmedabad and Patna (with students’ agitations ), and Indira Gandhi was defeated due to the power of people,” he said. “Whenever a Hitler is born, he is afraid of intellectuals and students as they are rebels,” the minister said.

481,['31/01/2020'],Bombay HC returns son born in Pune to Egyptian,"This story is from January 31, 2020

MUMBAI: The custody of an infant was restored to his Egyptian father by the Bombay high court on Thursday from his grandmother and aunt who have been caring for him since his Indian mother died two months after giving birth in Pune.

The court observed the 11-month-old had been in ""improper detention"" since last September and directed the police not to take any coercive steps against the Egyptian and his family when they are in India.

A bench of Justices S S Shinde and N B Suryawanshi said the child ""cannot be deprived of his father's love for no valid reason"". However, noting the care he had received in Pune and in view of the Supreme Court ruling that affection from both sets of parents is vital, they granted the two women visitation rights and video-conferencing access.

The father's lawyers, Navroz Seervai and Subir Kumar, argued that only provisions of the special marriage Act would apply when it came to custody of the baby since the couple was married under that law in Myanmar in 2014. The Hindu woman had met the Muslim man when he was working with a multinational in India in 2007 and they had fallen in love.

But his in-laws' counsel Sonal (who goes by one name) argued ""vehemently"", as the HC noted, that since the father is a Muslim, the child would be Muslim too, and hence Muslim personal laws would apply. Under these laws, the maternal grandmother can retain custody of a child.

The HC said it was neither commenting on nor deciding on applicability of personal law, but merely on restoration of custody to the child's natural guardian. ""It would be harsh to brand him by a particular religion since he is of very tender age and not capable of forming or expressing his wish,"" said the HC, leaving it open for the maternal family to approach a family court to decide on their legal rights for custody of the child.

The Egyptian father had approached the HC for a writ of habeas corpus (an order to produce in court someone who is unlawfully detained). Seervai pointed out that it was a ""settled law that writ of habeas corpus lies to restore the custody of a minor from a person who is not his legal guardian"".

The HC observed there was ""improper detention'' of the child by the maternal aunt and hence the father's plea is maintainable. Reacting to the in-laws' claim that change in custody would ""not be in the best interest of the child"", the court held that ""the ultimate future of child"" would lie with the father as his ""only surviving parent and natural guardian"". The Egyptian had neither abandoned nor neglected the child, was well educated and capable of taking care of his son, the HC said.

Tamil Nadu steps up screening protocol, orders blood tests for all travellers from China

Director of public health K Kolandaswamy on Thursday said the screening protocol, recommended by the Union health ministry, will begin by Friday morning.



The samples will be dispatched for further tests to King Institute of Preventive Medicine in Guindy.

Patients arriving from other regions of China would continue to be kept on domiciliary quarantine for at least 28 days after routine screening at the airport. All patients arriving from south-east Asian countries will be screened as per the new protocol, he said.

In the past one week, nearly 78 patients, including 10 Chinese citizens, arriving from China have been moved to home quarantines. A health inspector and a village health nurse visit them every day. “They will be asked to shift to a hospital if they show influenza-like symptoms. Till date, we haven’t seen anyone with such symptoms,” he said. Patients on quarantine include students, businessmen and employees of manufacturing and corporate firms in China, Kolandaswamy said.

The novel coronavirus, which was first detected in Wuhan, is now spreading to other parts of the globe. Kerala confirmed India’s first case of coronavirus on Thursday. A woman who studies in Wuhan tested positive for the virus that has till now killed 170 people and is spreading fast. As the number of cases is going up across the globe, the World Health Organisation and Centre for Disease Control, US, are monitoring the situation closely.

In Tamil Nadu, the health department has set aside a special unit with ten beds at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. “Additionally, we have beds in Tambaram GH as it is closer to the airport,” said health secretary Beela Rajesh.

The department, she said, received reagents used in diagnosis from the Centre on Thursday. “We don’t have to send samples to Pune anymore,” she said.

“As of now, there is no vaccine for coronavirus but personal hygiene goes a long way in prevention,” said former city health officer Dr P Kuganandam.

In the wake of India’s first positive case ,the state has stepped up healthcare vigilance in border districts such as Coimbatore and Nagercoil.

Passengers arriving from Wuhan at Chennai and other airports in Tamil Nadu are now required to provide blood samples for coronavirus screening with immediate effect.
